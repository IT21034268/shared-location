4,A Dynamic That Christians Need to Restore,"I am disgusted at hour our society regards everybody who dresses modestly as a ""fuddy duddy"" or ""uncool."" I even know some people who are like this. The Bible gives us plenty of guidelines for modesty in the way that we dress. (1) We are all ambassadors for Christ (II Cor. 5:20), (2) that a person should dress in a manner that is different from members of the opposite sex (Deut. 5:22), (I Tim. 2:10), (3) that we should strive to maintain a decent appearance before the world (Col. 4:5), (4) that we should show our worth by not conforming to the styles of those who are without God in this world (Rom. 2:12). Sadly, this has been abandoned in favor of being ""trendy"" and ""fashionable."" This book is highly reccomended for anyone concerned with this issue."
3,Focuses way too much on swimwear,"I purchased this book thinking that it would give a comprehensive overview of Biblical standards of modesty, and how Christians today can be faithful to those principals.Instead, I got a comprehensive overview of the history of the bathing suit. Now, I'm not saying that swimwear isn't an issue we need to submit to Biblical authority. But Jeff Pollard truly failed to offer any helpful tips on how Christian men and women can dress modestly in today's culture.So, if you want to read a book about swimwear, Jeff Pollard is your guy. If you want help figuring out how to put together a modest wardrobe, seek elsewhere."
2,Returned without notification,"I bought this book for my class. Three weeks into class, they tell me they no longer have it. At least they refunded my money. But why would you take an order if you can't supply the item? Terrible."
1,Nothing Interesting,"I don't understand why this book was even created. The author spends a lot of time mentioning other works and ideas that are key to this book, so why mention them. The author could sum up the message in this book in about 3 or 4 sentences. I guess that's why we have academics--to make simple ideas more complex. That's all you're getting with this book, and the main idea is not even that interesting. Man is sacrificed today too, just think of how many are sacrificed for dubious reasons in war. Wait, maybe i should write a book about this."
5,Easy parking in the garage,"This is a great product for people who have to park in a defined space. It is very accurate and easy to install. It will not help you if your parking issue is width related, it only works for people pulling in to a garage."
1,Total junk,"This thing is completely unreliable. I tried a variety of sensor heights and distances, and THREE DIFFERENT CARS. I moved everything else away from the sensor but the red light would not come on. I could have driven right through the wall without it telling me to stop.Apparently, based on the other reviews, a few people have gotten lucky, but there are also plenty of other people like me for whom it would not work at all. The odds aren't in your favor."
1,New model not as good as original,The new model has two sensors as opposed to one larger sensor on the original model. The original is problem free while the new seems to have problems finding the car.
2,Not worth all the hassle for the power/battery,"I think it is really unpleasing to have the power outlet and it is a real pain to have to worry about batteries... I don't think it's worth the price. I then found a ParkingTarget (ParkingTarget.com) which is non-technical, so it doesn't need power, and seems to work much better. You should consider it before making the mistake of buying this really expensive one."
3,park zone car parker,the park zone is a good product but the one that i ordered said i could park my vehicle up to 0.5ft. from the wall the ones that i recieved will only let me get as close as 1.3ft. that is not close enough for me to get it in the garage. i had the old units but i had to replace the batteries about once a month on one of them so i wanted to replace it with one with the ac power outlet i had the model no pzx-9901 i have one more of those and it works great .the new units i have are pz-1500 .i just tried anothewr way i moved the sensor up to 4ft now i can park as close as i want the sensor hits the winshild now it works perfect.
1,Malfunction the 2nd day I had it,"Don't think much of it. PZ - 1500 goes thru batteries in one day. Discharges them and then inoperable with just the flashing red light. Seems to work OK on 120vac adapter furnished with it. I can't use this though because I have no outlet in the near vicinity of the PZ, So the PZ 1500 was just a waste of money for me."
2,"When it works, it works well.","Intermitant operation, sometimes it senses the vehicle, sometimes not. When it senses, it works as described. The green LEDs need to be much brighter.I found no onsite tech support."
1,Unreliable Unit,Does not accurately position auto the same place any time. Tried to contact company - all lines disconnected. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.
3,park assist,"I had one for years and it broke due to probably an abrupt shutoff of the power followed by a pick when the power came back. I have bought one replacement unit and it did not work...it was like sometimes it lit the yellow and sometimes the green or the red but not in connection with the distance from the vehicle as it was supposed to do, I have returned it and bought another one (thank God for the Amazon return policies). This one works. Otherwise it does the job very well, and with the back up batteries one doesn't have to worry about blackouts."
5,Park Zone,We have two battery operated park zones in our garage since both cars have to get rather close to items in the front of the garage. We recently bought the dual power park zone for a friend that had the same problem. I highly recommend this product to anyone that has to park in tight spaces or needs help figuring out how far to pull in the garage.
1,Not cool,"Well, I had wanted this for a long time. Just got one for Christmas and couldn't wait to get it installed. We followed all the instructions, even measured. But if I didn't have the sense to stop short of the wall, I would have hit it because the light never turned on. If it did turn on, it would turn on way too late. Poor produdct, :("
3,Keep your old one,I have an older model of this unit. I bought the new one because the older one was starting to act up. The new model requires three (3) feet of vacant space on each side for it to operate properly. Find me a garage with that kind of extra room. I'm nursing the old model as long as possible then I'll just hang a tennis ball from the ceiling.
1,broken after 2 days of use,This is really a piece of junk. It went bad on the 3rd day of use. The red light keeps flashing. Reset won't work.
3,"It works, but...","It does work as advertised.. but then, so does a tennis ball suspended on a rope from your garage rafters, just touching the windshield of the car. And a tennis ball never needs batteries, either."
1,I've got a better Idea,"Tie a plastic golf ball on a string and tie it to the celing of your garage. Position your car where you normally park and lower the ball until it hits your windshield. Price .25 cents. HAHA. But seriously. This item stinks. It works 1/2 the time. Has a VERY ANNOYING clicking along with it. CLICK CLICK CLICK.. AWWWWWWW Cheap plastic. Dont drop it, it will break. Makes sence seeing it was made in Japan."
3,Help!!,I bought Park Zone two years ago and the batteries have failed since and I lost the directions to re-calibrate Park Zone. Can someone tell me how to set it up again?
1,Not like the older version,"I had to replace my old park zone and bought this one. I didn't realize that this was not exactly the same as the older version. It looked the same but it did not work the same. When I installed it on the wall, I was able to calibrate it with no problems. The lights blinked as it should and thought I was ready to go. When I came home from work, the lights did not light up at all as I tried to park the car. I recalibrated and tried again but the lights would not come on. I decided to return the item. It was not the same as the older version. Unfortunately the old version is no longer available."
4,Garage parking,"The park-zon 120 I think is going to be alright, but found it difficult to callibrate in our garage. I am not able to get the red or stop area to come on before I am too far into the garage. Must stop on yellow. I have tried to set it numerous times but never with satisfacyor results. Even so I think it beats the tennis balls hanging from the ceiling."
1,Not the greatest,"My husband purchased one for me for christmas 2004. It worked for a short time. Approximately for a month, now it doesn't do anything. Now the return policy is over and I cannot get the refund. Great while it worked but I agree that a bobber on a string touching the windshield is much cheaper and has done the job for the last 11 years."
1,worthless chinese junk,"first. no instructions in the box. nothing. not even a single slip of papersecond. defective. did not work. at all. despite days of tryingthird. website was terrible. no online instruction manual. hardly any information at all. just a download .pdf of a picture of the outside of the box.fourth. ""customer support"" is a joke. wrote an email asking for help with the product. no reply. nothing.in conclusion, its a worthless pieces of junk. i would give it zero stars if i could."
2,Disappointed,"First I ordered the product on the 3rd of the month. I didn't received until the 16th or so which ""Ticked me off.""The directions are very sketchy. I hooked it up, and it didn't work. I could only get it to work correctly when I connected it on a cabinet door. When the garage opens the light from the garage door opener makes it difficult to see the lights. Only the green and red appear to work.In fairness, my friend has one and it appears to work great. For me, I'm going back to the tennis ball."
1,Park-Zone Device,"I tried 2 different units and was unable to get either of them to work satisfactorily considering the price. The units were installed per instructions, with a 6 foot distance to one of the cars, and 10 foot distance to the other. They would work some of the time, other times couldn't get them to sense the car. Returned for refund."
2,Not impressed at all!,"With all of the positive ratings this item got I thought it was a great idea. But now that I have this item installed I find it to be very unreliable. It might just be my unit but at times the yellow light will stay on even though the car is in place, or the red light will turn on too soon. I have even experienced no lights at all. For an inexpensive alternative stick with the tennis ball, or 2x4 wheel stop."
1,Mine is in the trash - don't put your money there as well!,"After about 6 months of erratic operation [even on the AC power supply], and burning up alkaline batteries quickly, it was finally placed to rest in the appropriate trash receptacle. Save your money, hang a tennis ball on a string and align it with the place you wish to park your car. You will regret buying this thing - believe me now - or believe me later - your choice."
3,"Works well, but technology looks like it's from the 80's","The device works well and does what it is built to do. My only complaint is that the chunky plastic shell and coiled cord make it look like it is technology visiting from the 80's. All in all a good bargin in terms of performance, but lacking a sexy design."
3,Not practical - for me,This product works well if the car pull with in 2-3 feet of the wall and if the sensor is place 2 feet off the ground. We have about 5 feet space between wall and car and we store some stuff there. So I tried using this at around 4 feet but it did not work at all.
3,customer service,"This was my second park zone....The first one works great, sadly this one didn't work. Paid 9.41 to return to mfg. (no reimbursement) ??? When I checked to make sure they had received the faulty one ( 1 week later) they asked what my address was. Still don't have the new one or a refund, can't tell you if it works or not...can tell you their customer service isn't very good !"
5,"Works great! Kinda fun, too!","I bought this device for my mom, who had just moved into a new house with a new garage, as a bit of a joke. But when I went to visit her, she raved about it! I got to try it myself, and it worked great- mounted at a nice line-of -sight, you don't have to take your eyes off possible obstructions to the sides of the car, as I've noticed I've had to do with the tennis-ball-on-a-string deal. The device also works if you have a garage door mechanism that prevents the hanging of a tennis ball... and it's (I admit it!) fun to use- kind of like a drag-racing Christmas tree, only backwards!"
4,garage auto stop,This has been a great help in parking in the garage and stopping at the correct distance from the wall.
3,Park Zone PZ-1500,"I bought two devices to help manage my garge parking constraints. My space is limited and the cars just fit. I found the devices very easy to install and initialize to create the zones. After using them for several months, I found one of them eats batteries at a rate of four AA every other month so I switched it the supplied transformer. The manual claims the battery life should be about 12 months. They are very sensitive to any obstruction near them so if you move garbage cans around the transducers, it may impact the unit's performance, as I had found when I moved the recycling bin. As long as you are careful not to move things around the sensors and can use the transformers, the product works as advertized."
2,Does not work well in a small garage,I've owned this item for over a year. The problem I find with it is that is is not accurate when you are trying to park close to the wall it is attached to. This defeats the purpose for me. I don't think most people have no problem parking within two feet from a wall. If you want to get inches away from a wall this may not help you.
3,Eats batteries,"The ads for this thing say that it operates for up to a year on the batteries. I think they have a typo - make that a 'month' on the batteries. I've found that as soon as it gets low on power, it uses what it has left to blink the red light for a week until you replace them."
2,Parking Device very touchy,"This device works well -- if there is nothing in the garage to interfere with the operation. You need to have a completely clear field on both sides (not just directly ahead) or it just wont work. A good idea, but could use a much narrower field of ""vision"" to work in most garages, especially if your garage has other items (i.e. freezer, storage shelves) which will interfere with the operation. I am sad that it doesn't work better, but I found a piece of tape on the floor of the garage that I can line up with a piece or tape on the inside of my car door works better -- and every time!"
1,Don't Do it!,"I am very disapointed in mine.I was expecting it to be very accurate, but it doesn't work if you try to park closer than a foot from the wall.I have a large vehicle, and I need to get within 6 inches of my wall. This device WILL NOT work with that close of a range.Also I have been having to reset it alot (maybe because I am pulling up too close.)I think I'll just keep pulling up until I hear it crunch!"
4,It does what it supposed to do.,Setting up is a snap: (1) I mounted the sensor at the front bumper level. (2) Mount the light at eye level. (3) Connect the curly wire from the sensor to the light and connect the a/c adapter. (4) Park the car at the closest position. (5) Turn on the device. That's it!Pro: It does exactly what it supposed to do.Con: The battery last less than one week! Must use the power adapter.
1,Absolute Junk!,"I was hesitent to buy this product because of the reviews I read but I thought I will give it a try anyway.I bought this for my dad and it has not worked right since we installed it.The green or yellow lights never come on and the red light only comes on sometimes and at the wrong time.Do yourself a favor, don't buy this product."
2,Works --- sometimes,I purchased 2 of these -- Both worked initially (when you come into the garage at a very slow pace) --- now only 1 works and it seems that the company went out of buisness or something cause I can't find a contact # that works for them!
3,Park Zone System,I have only installed the device for a few weeks but am well satisfied. Our Lincoln Town Car is only about 2 feet shorter than the garage is deep and we have a garage door closer so precise parking is vital. With this device we have been able to park exactly as needed every time. No more getting out of the car to make sure the door will close or being afraid of hitting the garage wall.
1,It is useless,This parking device turned out to be completely useless because its sensor does not work correctly within the range of 1.3 feet - manual states that and I observed that as well. If I would not need to park the car closer than 1.3 feet to garage wall then I would not need this device at the first place.
5,Excellent device!,"What can I say other than 'it works great.' Very easy to install and setup. Simply park you car where you want it and press a button -- the park-zone will remember this location and signal you to stop whenever you pull in to that spot again. Took about 4 minutes to hang and setup. Batteries last a long time -- and in a very hot garage, too. I love it."
1,AC blunder,I bought one via amazon.com by auto alley. Had problems from the start. Did not work on AC power. Maybe because the power supply put out 15.6 volts instead of 9 volts listed. Even 9 volts seemed high when the unit takes 4AA batteries or 1.3 volt x 4 = 5.2 volts. Unit did not set up at all on AC power but did on batteries. Even than the Green light did not light when parking though the yellow and red did. Could park this way but definitely a bad product. Called auto alley and they stated they had many problems with this unit. Last heard from.
5,I dont have any complaints,I like this thing. It works really well and since it has a power charger it doesn't need to have the batteries replaced ever. The red yellow and green lights give a clear indication of where you are and when you need to stop.
1,poor customer service - bad product,"I recieved as a gift and thought it was great, for a while. The green light is so dim you cannot see it. I called and was told that was normal and it is caused by the green lens being too thick. This is wrong, the green LED is too dim. If I wasn't happy they suggested I return it."
2,would not buy again,I am not happy with this product as it only works intermittently. Have tried several things so that it will work on a more consistent basis and nothing has worked.
5,"Well Crafted, Informative Read","Ann Parson and Dr. Tanzi have put together an increadibly insightful, sensitive, and ultimately courageous portrait of the war that is being waged against this insiduous thief of conciousness. With crusaders such as Dr.Tanzi at the forefront of research to cure this disease, and gifted scribes such as Ann Parson, I feel as though I have a front row seat to an unfolding medical miracle. Kudos to Ann Parson for this superb, thought provoking work."
3,Queens Physician,Book was received in a timely manner from the seller. Was worth the penny I spent on it. It is readable and that's what I was looking for.
3,this is only the second half of a larger book,"This volume is only the second half of a longer study of the Humphrey(s) family in America. It contains only pp. 501 - 1115 of the original.So far I have not come up with part one of the study. Nothing on the Amazon site gives this information either. The writer, Frederick K. Humphreys, was also the author of many studies of homeopathic medicine, a field which he pioneered in the mid 19th century. There is a good article in Wikipedia about him.The confusing dates on the cover of this book are those of the author's lifespan. The principal focus of inquiry is the descendant line of Michael Humphrey, an English immigrant who sailed from Lyme Regis and arrived in CT by 1637."
5,This is one of the most comprehensive resources for teachers,I have used this book in my general methods course for the last two years. I have found it to be one of the most comprehensive resource on secondary school teaching for preservice teachers. It is packed with theory and practice knowledge essential to becoming an excellent teacher.
2,Hard to glean from,I got this book to skim and find techniques for the classroom I currently teach in. The layout of the book makes it difficult to quickly find methods.
4,good long lasting product!,"first off, ALL juicers do a dance when becoming unbalanced by 'fleshy' produce. keeping that in mind, always save the fleshy/pulpy stuff for the end and do the hard veggies first. aside from that, it's a great product and will last for years! my friend has her mothers omega juicer from the 60's and it still works!"
1,Terrible,"This Juicer should have National Recall. After put only 1 1/2 apple juicer get out of balance , and there was nothing witch will stop this ""DANCE"" .How somebody even produce something like this? Do they test this juicer at all?.Yes this juicer (using with filter) before start ""DANCING"" produce the best juice I ever have. But you can only juice 1 apple and 1 carrot and terrible vibration start,then you have to shut off , and wait around 3 minutes before motor stop spinning.There is not even safety switch to prevent from opening when motor still spinning, there is not any breaks to stop spinning and prevent ""DANCING"".Terrible, Terrible, Terrible design."
1,Major problems with this machine,"I bought this juicer for a cleanse, was told it was top of the line and was excited to use but like other reviewers said it ""did a dance"" which is a nice way to put it, we called it possessed. At first it did not work at all, but after being adjusted did but after a minute or so of juicing it would start to become incredibly loud, shake a lot and spin around. 3 adjustments later and it still was making this horrible noise. I do not recommend."
1,Stopped working after a few days,"I bought this juicer and the first few times I made juice it worked ok, but after a few days it stopped working. There's a reset button on the bottom and to get it back to working again you have to press the reset button every few seconds. So it juices for 3-5 seconds and then stops, then you have to press the reset button and then you can juice again for another 3-5 seconds. And halfway through my glass it stopped working completely. This has been very frustrating to use. And it takes a very long time to clean out all the pulp, too. I wouldn't recommend this juicer. I am calling Omega directly tomorrow to find out if they can either replace it or tell me what's wrong with it."
1,Worst juicer ever,"I am really disappointed with this juicer! My juicer was horribly loud as if I was trying to juice metal or something horrid. Then the juice doesn't just come out of the spout...it leaks all the way around...a nice feature if you have a dog who likes to lick up juice while you are juicing. Now, attempting another juicing adventure, the lid simply won't come off...period...its like forever stuck on the juicer...can't pry it off...put olive oil in the juicer to try and loosen it up, but no...again...just a large mess all over the counter. More juice comes out of the sides than the spout...how can that be effective. I could hand juice at this rate and get more benefits."
5,Good,Have purchased this item from Amazon in the past. Works very well on my steamer will continue to purchase this item
2,Didn't seem to work,Running some CLR through the steamer seemed to clean it much better than this stuff. I won't be buying this again and don't recomment it to others.
3,Have't used,Probably won't use the product. It takes quite a bit of product and time for cleaning if you follow the directions.
3,Tang Soo Do the Ultimate Guide to the Korean Martial Art,"This book is not a work of historical scholarship, but it is a great resource for the study of Tang Soo Do hyungs. For the price, you can't beat it. Tang Soo Do students who don't want to pay inflated prices for Tang Soo Do books, should give this book serious consideration."
3,It lacks something,"It's not a bad book at all, but it could de better. You will find only the first 3 Gi Cho Hyung, nevertheless higher Hyung like the Jip Soo are also presented. Concerning to Il Soo Sik, it's shown only few techniques; the same goes to Ho Sin Sul. In spite of all of these, it's a good book for reference. Once you are being taught the higher Hyungs, this book may help you a lot, but don't forget that you should keep it as a reference book; do not take it as your own instructor. Thinking about the price, it's a must buy book."
4,Essential Home Reference,"This book is an essential if your Tang Soo Do classes are only a couple times a week. Practicing wrong is worse than not practicing at all. So if you're putting out the effort, this book will assist you in getting it right during those teacher-less times. Easy to follow step by step forms, accurate foot placements. Not a 'learn to...' volume but a 'how to...' one. For the student, not the casual browser."
3,Good for the price,This is a pretty good book if you are a beginner and are looking mostly for a guide to help with Forms only. For the price it is worth it. Would be nice if he had another book with more on the one step sparring and self defense.
3,Pleasant Movie that Falls short of its potential,"There is a fun premise behind BE MY BABY that is never fully developed and a potential for a fun and charming story is missed.It's a typical boy meets girl and find their is sparkling chemistry but a simple misunderstanding quickly breaks them apart. Girl volunteers at a Day Care center run by her mother and ""borrows"" toddlers in a scheme to make philandering husbands ""pay"" for their misdeeds. Sounds interesting and it certainly could have been a lot more fun that it actually was. The scheme begins as a misunderstanding that turns into a dedicated plan to get revenge. It's hard relate to a woman who creates elaborate scams to make some money and get revenge.The movie is pleasant enough to watch but so much potential was lost in story."
5,Love it,"I love this cd iam a big fan of piero piccioni but this has to be one of my favorite from daytime fire to fairy tales, the best way to enjoy is in your car drive around and hear it works best if you are in a highway"
5,Genuine Aussie Music,"I first saw Bloodwood on the TV in Melbourne . Later during my travels of Australia I had the pleasure of being entertained by a member of the group, Scotty Balfour, under a stary sky by a fire in the outback while consuming large quantities of Victoria Bitter and red meat. Later that night I ran into Scotty at Bojangles in Alice Springs. Picked up a copy of this CD. I am of course a Slim Dusty fan but the boys make authentic downunder music."
4,Bradbury's best book,"I really do feel that this is Ray's best science fiction work ever. These are all different stories about man living on Mars but it has smooth continunity in all the stories. From the doomed first expedition to Mars to the last chapter where a human family prepares to start their new life in one of the Martian cities, each story keeps the reader interested in what happens next. I also like the fact that Ray maintains the large mystery surrounding the Martians. They who survived the onslaught of earthly diseases, remain in the background but never far from the minds of the colonists. Will they befriend the human colonists to their planet? I'm not sure, but from the few appearances they make with the colonists in the stories, I think the answer is Yes."
4,Out of this world!,"I'm not a huge science fiction fan and I've definitely moved away from fantasy to a large degree. Yet, all those disclaimers go out the door (or airlock?) when it comes to Bradbury. His stories always go well beyond the typical sci-fi/fantasy. They're darkly humorous and sometimes, just outright hilarious, while being brilliant at all times. This is no exception."
4,Fantasy disguised as science fiction.,"This collection of short stories certainly deserves the classic status it has recieved. Each story in this book is an entertaining read. The settings pull you into a bizzare world were anything is possible.However, to describe The Martian Chronicles as Science fiction is a bit of a stretch. Bradbury's vision of the future, the late nineteen nineties through the beginning of the twenty-first century, is unremarkable. He describes a Mayberry colinization of the planet Mars, complete with cozy little cottages and hotdog stands. This is completely forgiveable if you go into the book realizing it is really fantasy not science fiction. Bradbury makes up for his lack of futuristic vision with his ability to create intriguing scenarios."
3,A book gone boared,"The martian chronicles is a book about the colonization of people on Mars. The begining of the book started out pretty good. Men from the planet earth came to Mars and were exploring the planet and the culture. When I got to the middle of the book it kind of hit a flat spot and it seemed to just drag on. The book also made it incredibly difficult to remember what character did what through out the story. This was because the names the characters had such as Mr. Iii, Mr. Ttt, and Mr. Xxx. Overal I think this was a pretty good book. But it just did not catch me as it might catch you. This is a good book and I recomend it to everyone.Three stars ***"
3,not even close to Bradbury's best form,"As with most early science fiction efforts, with 'The Martian Chronicles' it is best to accept its overall preposterous aspects and enjoy it for other qualities, such as astute observations and criticisms of mankind. But in 'The Martian Chronicles', a somewhat loose collection of short stories involving humans (from Earth) colonizing Mars, this reader was left wanting for something insightful or special. Instead I found this collection of stories to be very readable, at times interesting, but also at times rather bland. And at no time did I sense this book deserved to be considered a classic. This would be an insult to its author who has indeed written classics (eg, 'Fahrenheit 451').Bottom line: a somewhat forgettable book that seems to have garnered more readership than it deserves. A near miss."
5,Wow.,"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I started and finished it today. It starts with a bang, and after that its all uphill. This book gives the cold hard facts of mankind, how we pilfer, and destroy everything we touch. The ending is just as great, if not better than, the beginning, and makes you want to turn the page and discover a new chapter, and another, and another, and you get the point."
2,I'm not a big fan of sci fi!,"I for one am not a big fan of sci fi books,novels or movies. I do however think this book was done very well.Its hard to write a book w/lots of bridges and different stories.It takes a good writer to make it make sense.Bradbury does a very nice job of putting the stories together and making sense. This book is very good for someone w/a good creative immagination.It had very creative inventions in it, such as the metal books and the flamming birds.Not one particular story stuck out at me.Maybe if I had a bigger interest in sci fi I might have enjoyed it more,and or thought about the book deeper."
3,"It was aveage, that's all.","""Martian Chronicles"" is an average book. It isn't something I would read for personal enjoyment, but I didn't really mind reading it as a class assignment. It had a lot of original ideas and a weird twist that made you want to keep reading. The class discussions based on the concepts of the stories were interesting and actually got my class in some heated debates. My least favorite chapter was ""Ylla"". As the first basic chapter of the book I thought it should have been more interesting. It made me not want to read the rest of the book. It was too confusing and boring. Thankfully, the rest of the book got better as it went on. My favorite chapter was ""Usher II"". This chapter had me turning the pages as fast as I could. It gave the book a bit of a horror novel twist. I would reccomend this book for a class assignment, but that's about all."
2,"Creative , Yet Unsatisfying","I really didn't care for this book at all. I don't like science-fiction. If you like science-fiction it is definitely the book for you & it's really well written. I'd have to say my favorite chapter is ""The Million-Year Picnic"". I thought it was really awesome how,the parents, revealed to the children that they were the real martians. My least favorite chapter was ""Way Up In The Middle of The Air"". I mean come on ,hello, are we on Earth or Mars? A little repetition of the 50's. This book was on a thin line of bad & ok. Don't get me wrong, Bradbury is talented."
2,"""The Martian Chronicles"" - a student review","We, an English course at a German Gymnasium, rate the book, The Martian Chronicles, a two because the structure of the book seemed quite confusing to us. Despite this fact we all liked the first couple of chapters a whole lot since the idea of settling a foreign planet was shown in an exciting way. After reading half through the book most of us put it away because from now on the stories got boring... Most of us found the effort of reading 308 pages a waste of time!"
3,-And the moon be still as bright ...,"overall, bradbury did a superb job of writing these science fiction stories. the stories are entertaining while still incorporating a bit of symbolism."
3,"It was okay, but it barely held my interest","I guess I liked this book, but it was rather boring. I didn't see any real problems with it and I don't want to discourage people from reading it, but if you aren't in to space fantasies, you won't like it. I did like the story Usher II. It had some good refrences to Edgar Alan Poe and a good lesson on censorship. As a whole, though, I did not enjoy this book."
3,This book is a must read for any sci fi fan.,"This book deals with almost every aspect of human nature, from Ylla to Usher II. If your looking for a nonstop thriller then this book isn't for you, but if you want a good book and your a sci fi fan then this book is for you."
2,This book could have been a short story and not a novel...,"The stories in the book ""Martian Chronicles"", are okay, but they all say the same thing. They are all about a group of people going to Mars, someone going nuts, and killing everyone. My favorite short story in this book is was ""Usher II"" It was exciting and interesting, but on the other hand, the one i hated the most was ""The Earth Man"". The reason i disliked ""The Earth Man"" was because by the fourth short story, I knew that every story is about the same thing. I think that the book could have been better if the stories weren't so similar. Overall, i would have not read this book if it was not required for me to do so."
5,The Martian Chronicles is great reading!,"This is really one of my favorite books. I pick it up every year and reread it purely for the pleasure. If you like fantasy, this one's for you. I hope that someday, Peter Jackson will make a movie of this story. After what he did with Rings, I know he could do it justice that the old TV mini series did not. Check this one out. It was written a while back, so add some years to some of the dates mentioned and remember, it's a fantasy...for now!"
3,The Martian Chronicles,"I think this book was good for students who enjoys science fiction. It was very creatively written, although I like Ray Bradbury's Farenhiet 451 better. Over all this is a good book for science fiction lovers. The thought of martian men and women in a community is funny!!"
1,Waaay too weird and disconnected for me to enjoy,"I couldn't finish this and deleted it.No complaints at all about the narrators,it's just the stories that are putting me to sleep.I feel no connection between the stories,and no interest in continuing.Didn't appreciate the profanity[though scattered],either."
3,Find a book that satisfies your interests.,"I wasn't really in to the book at first, so it was hard to follow. I liked the way the people and surroundings were described, but it seems like it took the describing as far as were I couldn't even understand it. I'm really not a fan of books, but when I have to read them, it's nice to read a book that interests me, and catches my eye. The story that seemed most enticing to me was, Way up in the middle of the air. I was able to follow, and understand the meaning of this story. I liked the way it described the river of blacks on their mission to leave earth. I like the non-fiction books better than the fiction, because they seem more real. They are also able to give me more of a mental picture, and it's easier to follow something that has happened to me or ever could happen to myself. I would reccomend this book to someone who likes fiction and easily follows descriptive books, for people like myself I wouldn't reccomend it: thats only my opinion."
3,BUDDY FLORA,"Martian Chronicles is a book about the colinization of people on Mars. I found this book very appealing because I found the topic very interesting. Some of the things that I did not like were some of the names of the characters. Such as; Mr. Ttt, Mr. Iii, and Mr. Xxx. This made it very hard to distinguish the charcaters from the begging to the ones near the end. In all I found this book pretty good. It was not one of the best books that i have ever read but overal it was very good. I would recomend this book to people who love fiction and like books of outerspace. It was good."
2,Sick in the middle...,"This book I picked for school being interested in Mars. My dad suggested it and I took his word for it. Big time mistake. It was totally the kind of book you would think a corrupt, badmouth guy would write. Two thirds of the people mentioned in the book are murdered and they ALL swear multiple times. The beggining and end chapters are okay, but the middle is full of murders and deadly boring. Please, if you are interested in the title, go to rent it at the library and just read the first and last few chapters."
1,gives new meaning to end of the world......,"Flame if you must, but I really didn't like Mr. Bradbury's ""Martian Chronicles"". To make matters worse I don't have any valid reasons why, maybe I should be a tad more open-minded.. but in this case I don't think so. It isn't that I don't like Ray Bradbury in general, because I loved Dandelion wine. I guess I just don't like the over-all theme of martians and the destruction of the things people love."
1,not so great,"i read this book with some classmates last year. i am now a sophmore in high school. this book was in the teens section, under fantasy. i found this book very very dull, and difficult to access. i have a somewhat higher reading ability than most of the students in my class. i think that for a younger adult (18-22) or so, this might be appreciated (MIGHT) but as a teen, i found this book very uninteresting."
1,the worst book i ever read,dont read this book if you are looking for a book that is interesting. the martian chronicles was easily the worst non-fiction book i ever read. it is boring and hard to understand. there is no flow and because of when it was written the author is completly wrong about how space exploration has turned out.DONT READ THIS BOOK
3,Dated and dissconected,"The book does not read like a novel or a bunch of short stories. It is understood to be a classic, but I thought a classic holds up and this does not. There are solid worthy ideas in place, but I did not feel like an adult as I read it. Might be great for high schoolers, who could find some new ways of looking at the world, but it was not great entertainment."
4,Really Strange Read!,"This book is so different from anything I have ever heard and so it took me a minute to really get into the stories. This book was recommended to me by a close friend so I ordered it and I am glad I did. This was written years ago but you would not know it from the various stories in it. I found this book to be exciting, strange and most entertaining!"
3,The Martians,"The martian chronicles was a book I was assigned to read, I found it confusing but with an occasional intresting story. I say to think of the book as a bunch of short stories unstead of one long story and you may understand it better."
2,BEWARE THIS BOOK IS EDITED!!,"The William Morrow Hardcover Edition (February 1, 1997) appears to be missing a story: "" Way in the Middle of the Air ""Mr. Bradbury wrote a story where all of the black people get fed up with the south, and the way they are treated, load up the rocket and leave all of the bigots behind. Incredibly some paper pushing editor must have thought this story would offend our sensitivities, and took it upon him or herself to remove it from the chronicles.Strange that the work of Mr. Bradbury, a champion of free speech, is being edited.Do not get this version! (I got hosed, but vowed to save my fellow readers from the same fate)!"
2,Great book.... but AVOID THIS VERSION,"I feel that ""The Martian Chronicles"" is one of the best and most creative works of Science Fiction of all time, but I would recommend buying another copy of it. There was one chapter in the original work that was taken out of this version. Apparently the editors felt its racial themes were too strong, although I feel it was, in reality, speaking out against the racism of the 1950's. Its ironic how Bradbury has always been so outspoken in his writing against censorship of books, and yet his own book was censored."
4,Destructive Humanity,"I've had this book laying around for years, kind of wish I would have read it sooner. The book spans around 27 years of man/martian history. It is striking in alegory and observation. Anyone with and eye and an ear should enjoy the many short stories that deal with issues like racism, greed, paranoia, hate, loss, and jealousy; just to name a few. The book is at times humorous, and sad, but always profound. I realy enjoyed watching the story progress through the wonder in frontier, into the darkness of self destruction, and into the silver lining of hope.I should also warn that the book is a compilation of short stories that follows a timeline, or chronicle of martian/man history, and not one straight novel with long developing plot and characters, though some do have multiple appearances. It is a book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and backgrounds. Don't miss it. I know it made me a fan of Ray Bradbury."
3,well liked,"I really enjoyed The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury .It was a very interesting and at times disturbing novel.The book is about the adventures of a few different crews as they make their way to Mars.My favorite part of the book by far was the chapter entitledThe Third Expedition.This chapter was about the men making their way to Mars only to find all of their dead relatives there.Like I said I really enjoyed the book but at sometimes it did drag, but i still reconmend that you read it."
4,Long Live Ray!,"This is not quite my favorite collection by Ray Bradbury, but it would have to be pretty darn close. Bradbury has a way of writing to keep the reader interested. His plots are simple, yet intriguing; uncontroversial, yet explosive; quiet, yet powerful. He puts into this book what should go into every book. He wrote the book as if the events had actually happened and that is why I respect this collection so much. Even the short stories are powerful when read along witht the other stories. Long live the master!"
3,This is for anyone who loves science fiction books.,"On the terms of Bradbury's accounts, I thought his book was semi interesting and very creatitve. He has a good sense of getting people hooked on his writings, and by keeping the book's chapters intact is also makes it interesting. ""The Martian Chronicles"" is very ironic and also very futuristic. It makes you think of what may be in the future. I'd refer this book to anyone who likes to read science fiction stories."
3,The book was well written but not realistic.,I did not like the book very much because I am not much of a sci-fiction kind of reader. The book is very well written but not very realistic at all. I did not like the fact that it was a bunch of different storys either. I like books with one plot better than a bunch of different stories with all different characters. In my opinion I would not read this book if you do not like science-fiction.
3,"Good for Treki-fans, but a little boring for the rest of us","This book was an interesting blend of descriptive writing and science-fiction. It draws you in by the way it shows the martians lives. The descriptions did get a little tiresome. My favorite story was USHER II. It gave a lot of action, and suspense. I guess that's just what I like. The story I liked the least was AND THE MOON BE STILL AS BRIGHT. It dragged on too long and lost my interest after the first page. I could definately see how some people could love this book, but even though I liked some parts, as a whole I thought it was a bit of a snooze."
5,Always a joy to read.,"I picked up this book again after reading it as a child. It has lost none of its lustre. Bradbury's novel presents both an engaging metaphor of colonialism, as well as, an accurate portrait of human nature. A must read."
5,Sci-Fi thats woth reading,Ray Bradbury is one of the few science fiction writers who actually writes something worth reading. There will come Soft Rains is great as a story by itself and the only story I could have done without was The Long Years.
3,It was a pretty good book.,"Martian Chronicles was a good and interesting science fiction novel. It touched on many controversial subjects from here on Earth, and portrayed a vivid picture of life on Mars.My favorite story from the book was ""Green Morning"". I liked how it showed how things from Earth acted differently on Mars. It was detailed and painted a good mental picture."
2,This was the weirdest book!,"Ray bradbury's book, The Martian Chronicles, was a complicated book. It was hard to read because nothing tied together, and every story was left with out an end. I understood it but never really liked it that much. Each individual chapter was terrific that is why I gave it any stars at all! The chapters made since but I just hoped that somehow they would eventually tie it all up together. This is my Review of the book The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury that was published in another world in 1948. This was reviewed by Stephanie :o"
3,Mars is not the place for humans,"I really thought it was an alright book. I am honestly not a book reader so I really didn't get into it. Since this book was ficticional, I really didn't care because I like non-fictional books that pertain to my everyday life. Martian Chronicles is the kind of book that only certain readers like and enjoy. I for one am not that kind of person. No offense to any readers whom really liked this book. I admit that if I might of spent more time in trying to relate to this book maybe my opinion would change. The only story I liked to a certain point was ""The Luggage Store."" So I would recommend it. In conclusion, I may not of liked this book as much as others, but keep it in mind this is my opinion."
5,Stupendous,"This book displays Ray Bradbury's incredible imagination and talent to make Mars, and life on Mars (something that could become very real) come to life. This book is a must - read for all sci-fi lovers and for people who like a good twist in their stories. Bradbury always comes up with some shock to end you with; leaving you wanting more and more. But since he has written 6 thousand other things we are very fortunate to have more. Don't let this be the one you don't read."
4,"A little creaky, but still worth reading","It's been many years since I last read this collection, and I was surprised on several levels. I'd forgotten the lyrical language, laying the visual scenes and emotions down so clear you can see and feel them. Some of the ideas and concepts he was dealing with (exploitation of a new world; how a race might react to being invaded, how will religions adjust to meeting other races) are current topics still. Indeed, Stanley Kim Robinson focused on some of them in his Mars trilogy. But I was reminded that this book is a product of its time, especially when dealing with the roles of women and nuclear family, which stayed firmly in the 1950s. But some of the stories, notably Night Meeting, The Fire Balloons and The Martian are still gems. And it's always good read the old classics -- it helps one to appreciate where the new ones came from."
4,I really give it 4 1/2 stars,"I've never read Bradbury prior to picking up this book for a class. Very intriguing stuff, and I'll definitely read more of his work if I get the chance. It makes for some great comparisons/discussions on imperialism, colonization and all that good stuff, while also immersing you in a completely new world. One of my favorite chapters was ""There Will Come Soft Rains,"" in which an abandoned house on Earth continues its daily routine of making food, cleaning the house, alerting its (former) occupants of the time and events, etc. Only towards the end do we see the silhouettes of the occupants as the only remaining paint on the side of the house; everything else has been seared away. An interesting look at what Earth could become, and the role that Mars or any other planet may play."
2,Its glory has faded with time...,"The first time I read this book, a few years ago, I loved it and I worshipped Ray Bradbury. I found it profound and funny and sad and everything a good book should be and then some.The second time I read it...not so much. Maybe I'm getting older and more cynical. His bright-eyed enthusiasm and innocence is still refreshing, but the bemoaning of All We've Ruined gets a little old. And I find it a little disturbing that he repeatedly kills off the boring close-minded characters... like they don't deserve to live. And we haven't lost our imaginations and this planet isn't done for -- yet. Amazing how such an enthusiastic optimist can have so little hope.There are still gems and beauty here. The best thing about it is that it's not at all what you expect from the title(an effect clearly lost the second time through) and the absurdity of man is wonderfully funny at times. I guess I mostly just wish it didn't harp on the same things story after story. [...]"
4,Something...Different,"Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is a story like nothing that I've read before. At first, I was confused as to how people were able to breath and live on Mars. I had to remind myself that it is of course a work of fiction. Nevertheless, these loosely related short stories tied together into a full length novel in an artful way. This story is unique in and of itself and should be read by any child interested in space or any adult who grew up reading Ray Bradbury.Zachary B. MedinaAuthor of Decador"
2,"Kind of a mess, actually","In spite of Bradbury's prose, which is lyrical and incredibly enthusiastic, I really didn't care for most of these tales. The book feels very dated, especially with it's cold-war fears of blase censorship and social propriety. Although the story about blacks in the south going to Mars to escape Jim Crow is interesting from an anthropological point of view. (Apparently a sci-fi writer in the 1950's could more easily conceive of interstellar travel than imagine a civil rights movement). But a lot of these feel like unfinished fragments, and even the ones that stand well on their own get sort of muddled and lost amidst the more outlandish ones. A genuinely sorrowful tale about a family abandoning a war-torn earth for a lonely, red planet just doesn't mesh into the same universe as someone who builds robots to stage an elaborate, Edgar Allen Poe styled revenge fantasy. It's a mixed bag of poignancy and kitsch"
2,I thought it was too unrealistic,The book said that we would be on Mars in about 30 years and i thought that was way untrue it seems to close for us to be leaving a planet that desn't have to much wrong with it
2,Confusing,"I though this book was EXTREMELY confusing. I think this book was ""Way over my head."" If you are young and have'nt read books of this type before I suggest you don't read this one."
3,forgot how boring this was,movie was better....story thin and implausible then and now......of course he mademillions on it....big yawn sorry i actually paid $ for it
3,Just Boring,"I thought it was funny that, when commenting on the TV Miniseries adaptation of this book, Bradbury said it was ""just boring"" because that is what I thought of the book.This is not one consistent and connected story, but rather a collection of short stories about the future history of a Mars colonization. Anyone who has read ""The Illustrated Man"" knows that short stories are not Bradbury's strength. Reading this book was like reading a collection of long-lost post-it notes with ideas that popped into Ray's head late at night before he fell asleep.It's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it to a casual sci-fi or Bradbury fan."
2,"Bradbnury Falters, Sci-Fi Nerd Stumbles, Calamity Ensues","This book is HIGHLY overvalued. Most of the stories meander and are ultimately unsatisfying. Only a handful are meritorious, but they do not serve as justifiable rationale to purchase the book. Read Classic Stories I and The Illustrated Man instead."
3,satisfied,"I really enjoyed the novel The Martian chronicles by Ray Bradbury.It was a very intresting, and at times disturbing book. The novel records the events that take place on a number of expeditions to the planet Mars. My favorite part of the book was pages 48 to 59.This part of the book is about an expediton that when the crew gets to Mars everyone's dead relatives were on the planet. This is a very intersting piece of sci-fi. Even though at sometimes it did ddrag,but i still reconmend it."
2,Martian exploration Bradbury style.,"I have read quite a number of Mars related novels, and seen many Mars related textbooks, as well as novels. The Martian Chronicles does not stand out as one of the better ones of the group.If you like the way that Bradbury writes, then go ahead and get this book. Just don't compare it to the mini-series, they are rather dissimilar."
3,Father Mars arose from the snow-topped crag of Mount Haemus,"This is more along the lines of bunch of short stories in chronological order. I would love to give this book 4 stars but some of the stories were terrible, they didn't make sense and hard to follow.Yet their were a couple like ""Usher II"" and ""Way in the Middle of the Air"" that were amazing, some really good stuff. ""While The Silent Towns"" had me laughing out loud.If you don't mind trying to make sense of the other ones. But all mean help yourself some hidden treasures"
3,A classic - but...,"I know this is a classic, but I just could not get into the stories at all. Just not my sort of thing."
3,Great Book for all ages,"The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury The Martia Chronicles is a series of short stories or chronicles, about the way life would be if we lived on Mars and what happened to those that tried too. It also puts us in a Martian's perspective, and looks at the way it would be for them. Bradbury has wonderful extrapulations and a vivid imagination, that kept you wanting more.The book was very intersting due to the fact that he described everything so well. The book made you feel as if you were living in that time period, with the martians.My favorite chronical, would have to be ""there will come soft rains"" because I liked the depth it had and the hidden meaning to it.In conclusion, I thought the book was good, it held my intrest and thats hard to do. I would recomend it to someone else."
1,CRAP,"CRAP, that just about sums up this impossibly s-l-o-w and preachy film.If you want to expose yourself to different cultures, may I recommend instead: Sita Sings the Blues."
5,"Amazing artistic achievement, wonderful story","We saw this movie on the big screen, and I can't wait to own my own copy. As the parent of a 7 year old, we've seen a lot of children's movies (the well known Pixar and Disney titles as well as arthouse and foreign films for kids). In my opinion, this is the most beautifully made, and well told, animated film ever. That's a pretty high bar, I know, but I don't think I'm raising any false expectations.I recommend this film without reservation to audiences of all ages who are in the mood to be transported by a good story, well told, and beautifully rendered."
5,Wonderful Film - and here's a 1926 one to loook at!,"This is indeed a wonderful and beautifully made film, and deserves the highest recommendation for those interested in romance, adventure and fantasy.The fact that the Arab characters in the film speak in untranslated Arabic is a director's choice that adds wonderfully to the mystery of the enterprise. I was able to follow the actions and intentions of the characters even though I don't understand the language.If you like this film, there is a wonderfully made 1926 German silent film, The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926). It can rightfully be said that Azur and Asmar is the (great?great great?)grandchild of this film, which was done entirely with paper cutouts! Try to get a copy of this and be amazed as I was at the fluidity and dynamism of the story and the images. This too is not to be missed! Turner Classic Movies shows this from time to time in their Sunday Night Silent bloc. Look for it!"
5,A great story of tolerance,"Americans may not understand it fully as it is talking about the relations between the French and North Africans, which is especially relevant as to the large population of Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians in France (or people of those descents). This film caries nonetheless a beautiful - and universal - message of tolerance, which can easily be transposed to American and Hispanic relations. The graphic design of the animation is unique and beautiful. On a high definition screen, the colours are breathtaking. Great soundtrack. The story is told both in French or English and Arabic, with no subtitles for the latter, but it is pretty self evident and ads to the message. Enjoy!"
5,Good Purchase,The Movie arrived sooner than expected. I was happy with the purchaser. My kids love this movie. It is visually spectacular.
5,if you like travelling...,"I discovered Azur and Asmar when in Paris last April. The children were watching it on a French channel. I got captured straightaway, as soon as I heard the sounds and saw the beautiful pictures. It is a cartoon full of depth and sensitivity ! If you are romantic and like to be taken to other cultures : this is the DVD to watch... just beautiful !"
3,no title,"The author has an odd grudge against money and it shows in this novel. He seems to be writing mostly about money and why not to want it. In 1923. I think it somewhat simplistic at its core, however. Is it money that is really the evil, or is it character deficiency that puts money on an altar and measures success by it? Money is only useful for the choices it allows us to have in living our lives. Without it, no choice is available. The book covers over a decade and at the end gets very preachy and throws in World War I almost as if the author forgot about it and had to stick it in somewhere. But it is definitely an interesting read about life in the 20s - Florida, Prohibition, trade unions, socialism."
4,A good collection and introduction to Strand,"I agree with the last 2 reviews: being well-known and well spoken of does not preclude a poet from writing good poetry, and this collection is a very good sampling of Strand's work. I'm particularly fond of his early work, and this collection continues to keep in-print poetry that otherwise might not be read since his earlier collections are out-of-print.Yes, a poet brings to his work a certain personality, and we can't fully separate the two. But in the end, poets are vessels and it is the poetry we are interested in--if not, we'd be psychologists."
4,"Fascinating, earthy, fun","Someone clearly has an axe to grind in their ""review"" of Strand's work and personality. I heard him read reluctantly, knowing little of who is was or what he was about and I was completely charmed by his clarity, his humor and his darkness of vision."
3,Ethereal,"strand's poetry has a surrealistic, ethereal feel to it. while you won't find many great poems here (but do read ""The Tunnel""), you will find a lot of interesting, solid poems that make it a worthy collection to read."
2,overrated?,"I know a lot of people who love Mark Strand, & I know he has done a lot of work for poetry, but he really doesn't seem to me like he's a special poet, hype aside. I read a lot of poems in this book waiting for them to go somewhere, for Strand to find inspiration, but it never happened. The poems have a foot nailed to the ground & like it that way, so they can just sit there while other things do stuff. There are a few good poems, but anyone who writes a lot of poems writes a few that are good. If this is the kind of writing you want, maybe you would appreciate this guy, but there are so many poets of comparable aesthetic who do it so much better."
4,An interesting book,"I think this was a good Agatha Christie book. I agree that the beginning was a bit slow...but it got more interesting. And like always, theres an interesting, unexpected twist at the end..."
4,"Interesting, but there are better books.","This book did not easily catch my attention in the beginning. However, after a few chapters, I finally caught on. Even though it may be rather easy to understand, it's not one to put you on the edge of your chair. I am not saying that it is a bad book, but I have read better ones."
3,Okay,"I've only read about 11 Agatha Christie books, but this one was one of the worst that I have read so far. I'm not saying it is bad, but it's not that great compared to some of her other books. The middle was slow, and it started out slow. The ending was sort of surprising, but I had figured out who the murderer was because it was pretty obvious. If you want to read some really good Agatha Christie books, I suggest And Then There Were None, or The Murder of Roger Acrkoyd."
4,Good solid mystery,"The classics never go out of style. Good reading, well written, and interesting. I started reading the Christie mysteries about 6 months ago and have not been disappointed yet"
3,Peril AT End House thru Amazon,"It is not I who reads Poirot but my beloved husband, who says this book is not up to the other Poirot books. However, since he is a big fan of Poirot (and Amazon, incidentally) he is happy to have it in his library.Jacqueline Davidson"
5,great album,"I can see why a lot of Ms&Ps fans didn't like this album very much, as it does not sound like their earlier music. Give it a listen, though--check it out for yourself. I love this album because the music is really good, very listenable, and it's very unique. There's not much music that sounds like this. For me, the best part of the album is the second half of it. Great harmonies and great, laid back music. For those who love the Wolfking of LA album by John Phillips or the Whatcha Gonna Do from Denny Doherty, you should definitely check this one out. Maybe people who have burned out on too much standard Mamas and Papas radio-fare could get into this, as you probably haven't heard any of these songs."
4,People Like Us,"Most people put down this cd alot because there isn't as much electricity as when the group were together in the 60's. This was a reunion album in the 70's and the group was more into their own individual voices at that time. But, I don't mind this album that much. I think its pretty good for what it is and Im glad I got it. It shows a different style to the Mamas and Papas' voices, and Step Out and Pearl are outstanding tracks. The cd is worth buying just for those songs!"
2,"None of the chaos shows...but there's no joy, either","Contractually required to come up with a record, John Phillips closes the chapter on his Mamas & Papas tale with a lovely but inconsequential record. It opens with a blissful title cut, but loses inspiration from there. Yes, it is enjoyable in spots, but there's very little personality in evidence, no heart and no soul. C+"
2,One Bad Album,"There is no bigger fan of The Mama's And The Papa's (anyone else notice that their name is a grammatical error?) than I am. I re-listened to their five studio albums recently, and this album is every bit as bad as I remembered.Hearing ""European Blueboy"" was the inspiration for this review. I wrote in the liner notes (for when I listen again, in ten years), ""This is the single worst song the M's & P's ever wrote"". I dare you to name another.This album is for completists only."
2,where is Mama?,Snow queen from texas is a cool song. Mama Cass musta took the month off as she is nowhere to be found on this album!
4,Music for your soul,"If you need a peaceful space for relax and meditation, and wish to be surrounded with confort sounds, this is the kind of music you cannot do without! The well selected pieces of classics will carry you wherever your mind, thoughts and imagination wish for. Have a safe journey while listening to the best of Strauss!"
3,Adequate book,"I am a minister using this book for the study of the nicene creed. It was somewhat wordy and from a theological position that isn't mine. Therefore I ended up not using it as much as I would like. However, it does have some valuable things to say and I would recommend it."
3,Was not what I expected,"Not what I expected and after reading various reorts, thought it was not for me. Saw it on Dr Oz, bought it on a whim."
3,allergies,i have taken this for allergies and it is a wonderful solution. you really have to high dose your body with it for a few weeks. it will take you several jars to properly accomplish this. But it really helps my seasonal allergies.
5,Best I have had,"I have purchased other bee pollen from one of my favorite brands but this one tastes WAY better. I also feel a peace of mind knowing it is organic. Love it and shipment time was wonderful.If you have read about the health benefits of bee products and are considering bee pollen, the flavor of this one is worth the price, hands down. It is a smidge sweeter and the texture is better, too. Hope this helps."
2,gross,"This stuff tastes nasty. It youre going to get this product, be prepared to gag when trying to swallow. Not entirely sure how bee pollen should taste, but from descriptions of other bee pollen types, im sure it's supposed to taste better than this. lol!"
3,"not ""steamed"" about this product",The hanger wasn't what I was expecting. I think the hangers I have in my closet will do just as well as this one. I think I made a poor choice in ordering it.
2,Ok but overpriced and unnecessary,I would purchase this again if it were $20.dollars less. It is not really necessary as a substantial 'regular' hanger would work fine..
4,Stupidity,"I thought this was a pretty good album. its a little whackier than the other Bad Manners releases, but what do you expect from these crazies. ... but if you like bad manners a lot, i would DEFINATELY recommend getting this album."
1,"How would I know, amazon.com won't deliver it!!","I ordered mine at amazon.com's back in early December. I am still waiting for it. They have delayed it 3 times already. They are telling me now that I might get it come April. At this rate, perhaps I will finally get it before next Christmas! Don't be fooled by their ""1-2 days shipping"". Sure, it only takes 1-2 days to ship it; after they hold your order for 4 MONTHS. Other than amazon.com, this might be a good product."
3,not for golf,"I decided I wanted a range finder when I played golf with my father-in-law. He had the Bushnell Yardage Pro 1000 and it worked great. Just point, shoot, and the yardage to the hole was returned promptly every time.I was really excited when I first got this range finder ...until I got it on the golf course. It is much smaller than the YP1000, but the Sport model's superiority ends there. When you are inside 150 yards, it can range on a flag fine. Any farther than this and it becomes more trouble to use than it's worth. You have to hold it very steady and it takes several seconds for the range to register (if it is going to register at all).This range finder may work fine for hunting, but if you are going to use it for golf then spend the extra money and get a better model. I am currently looking at the Bushnell Yardage Pro Tour XL 20-2025, but I haven't tried it out yet."
4,range finder bushnell,great range finder easy to use an is very fast giving u the yardage that u laser. can't beat this range finder for the price
2,not so hot for golf,"This unit works effectively only under 200 yds. and will not find a pin on the green.In order to get a reading, you must focus on a golf cart, a tree, or a person on the green. The rangefinder can work well in hunting when a large stationary target is available, but for golf, although very accurate, has limited application."
2,Bushnell Sport 450,This product does not lock on to flags over 130 yards with any consistency. I would not recommend this item.
4,bushell range finder,good for fishing but the instructions aren't very clear.It took me a while to work out how to change from Metric to Imperial measures
3,get the upgrade,"I went cheap and got the 450 for golf. It's almost useless over 150 yds out. My cart partner had a Pinseeker, and he had no problem shooting traps 275 away. I could not hit the carts ahead of us. The Pinseeker actually shoots the flag, something the 450 can't. Mine's going back."
1,ng for golf,"I got this item as a gift in the winter I could not use it until late summer. Bushnel says it was not made for golf but for hunting. It does not give true readings to the flag at all. It is advertised as using for that shot of a life time ,What a line of bull.They will do nothing for me because I did not contact them within 30 days. An impossibility since I could not try it for a few months. DO NOT BUY FOR GOLF!!!"
2,golf player,"I had this rangefinder once and sold it, I miss it so I got the one I have now, but it seem this one take longer to get my yardages, also I feel it does not fine a long range like 200 yards and be on.and some times it does give me the yarders, could it be a bad battery?Eddie Irlanda"
3,Not for golfers,"I bought this item for use on the golf course. It seemed to work fine determining distance to large fixed objects, but it couldn't lock on the flag stick. I was willing to give it a shot for the low price, but I returned it after a single round. Have used Bushnell's other products with Pinseeker technology, and they work well. I'll buy one of those when I'm ready to suck up the bigger price."
4,Another great toy for BIG BOYS,"Bought this for my dad (he lives in Argentina), he was soo happy... playing to measure everything in the house. It wasnt very expensive, super easy to use, great!"
1,yardage pro 450,Total waste of money if you are using for golf. This unit that I purchased will give false readings on yardage and sometimes will not give yardage. Sent it back to Bushnell and they sent it back to me and said nothing was wrong. Save your money and buy a good rangefinder
3,Golfers put negative reviews in perspective.,"Golfers put negative reviews in perspective. You are golfing not field testing electronics for perfection. With my Nikon that just died I could not sight a flag at distance either. I just sighted a bunker etc. It takes 9V batteries that may be easier to get at a gas station in a pinch. It is a 1/4 more bulky over my Nikon so I don't give it a 5 star, but not bad. Such bulk may make it less easy to lose however."
3,rangefinder,"it generrally works at close range, but there are issues in slightly low light and the distance even in proper lighting does not record on the display."
1,Total Crap,This horrible mangling of a talented artist is total crap. This cd is almost a big an insult to real musicians as that Hung.
1,Err.. What??,This album has truly ruined the purpose of selling so well! I luv Avril's music but a tributes a bit too far over the edge! the person sounds nothing like avril and in fact it hurts my ears listening to it! in fact its worse then avril singing live.. and thats REALLY bad!
2,Pointless covers done in a lame pop-styling,"Now, even though I started out with that lead title for my thoughts here, it should also be known that I don't think this is as bad as people are making out! Sure each song is a near spot-on remake of each tune from Avril's debut disc (which begs the question why make this in the first place?!), and yes they're a lot weaker in vocal power than the Canadian songstress, but overall they are pleasureable to listen to! I'm just totally confused as to why this album would have been made in the first place!"
3,I didnt think is was bad at all!,"I thought it sounded great! It was totally laid back, and not so agressive vocally. I am also an Avril fan and aperantly so are the makers of the C.D. Congrads, i'm sure Avril was happy, because it didnt compare to her AT all. Take a chill pill. Thanks :"
1,OH MY GOSH! THIS ALBUM [STINKS]!,"Okay this album has totaly mutalated Avril Lavigne! Avril Rocks, but the Ex Prom Queens are a joke. They [stink]... just some Jr. High basement band. Oh my god, they try to imitate Avril's awesome voice, but they totaly stink. if you like Avril Lavigne, I highly reccomend Let Go, which has more songs and is actually professional!Ex Prom Queens [STINK]! Don't waste your money or time!"
1,I'd give it a minus but that's not possible,These people need serious help. This is absoulutly the worst CD I have EVER heard. Don't waste your time trying to figure out if this is a bad CD.
1,All agreed,I totally second the twitchy after listening to a few clips. I couldn't handle more than 4 seconds of the butchered complicated or I'm with you. WHY would someone do this? Why?
1,Avril and this sucks....,"Even though i seriously hated it, if i had the money and if i had no brains i would buy that cd because they suck and so does avril and these poser fake chicks singing make avril look crappy.....and to me, that's a good thing."
1,do NOT buy this Album!!,"Okay, If you are a fan of Avril Lavigne's - DON'T support the people who made this! They completely butchered all of Avril's great songs! The singers do Avril NO justice and it's justpainful to listen to in comparison to ""Let Go"" - the amazing debut album from Avril Lavigne. If you have that album, then you don't need this horrible excuse of a tribute."
1,Too bad no stars isn't available...,"Why would anyone want this album? If you like Avril Lavigne, by her CD! Don't buy this just because it has her name on it. It's a bunch of no names with really horrible versions of Avril's songs. I can't believe there is actually a market for this crap. If people want to sing Avril, they should do what everyone else does--go to a karaoke bar!"
1,3 Words for this Band ........[GET A LIFE!!!!!],Would somebody please tell me what are this bands thinking doing this badass tributes to artists like Avril Lavigne? OHHH MY GOD i can't beleive it!
1,Nooo!,"Ok... The whole thing is... Horrible. I listened top Sk8ter Boi and Complicated and said ""Yuck. That's bad."" but when I heard her sing I'm With You, my fave song in such a horrible voice I lost it!Go buy ""Let Go"" instead."
1,What were they thinking!,This person cannot sing! What were they thinking when they hired this person. I only listened to part of the complicated clip and I could already tell it was a bad cd!
1,and i thought the real avril was bad enough,"you've got to be kidding me. you call this a tribute? i don't even like avril lavigne, and this chick is a disgrace to her. why anyone would buy this is totally beyond me. please, take my advice and save your money for something better - how about your own microphone, so you can sing the songs and sound a thousand times better than the so-called attributer?"
2,ok,i think the album is ok. The singer sounds like avril lavigne but dosnt come close to the real thing. if you ask me i don't know why they make these types of albums. stick with the real deal. she's way better!
1,Worst piece of 29 second music ever!,"I was just listening to the sample of Complicated of this phoney girl and it was HORRIBLE!!!!! I wouldn't want this CD if you gave it to me for free! I would even want it if you gave me 5 boxes of this CD to sell! I don't want to help this fake girl ruin the hearing of people! It's an insult to people all over the world! I first heard Avril live on TV and thought that was BAD- but after listening to this- jeez, if this isn't the worst and most ridiculous thing ever- I don't know what is!"
1,Thank God I didn't buy it!,"I didn't even listen to the whole of one song to understand that this sounded terrible! It sounded like a sick cat trying to ruin a song! I only listened to a sample of a song on the internet, and I was laughing it was sooo terrible! Never buy it!"
1,pop culture injures ears once again,"there is no artist out there whose public image is more insulting then that of Avril Lavigne. The girl isn't talented and is the worst breed of poser punk and i was unfortunate enough to recieve this item as a gift. Upon listening to it I discovered two things: One, no artist of her character deserves a tribute CD, Two, The only thing worse than listening to Avril Lavigne is listening to people trying to be like her. Although it is refreshing to hear someone else's voice, its still in her image. If you know a punk and you're looking for something for them, find something else."
1,pointless,"Only one disc and somehow Avril gets a tribute album?Her originals are bad enough, but no one needs bad covers of them."
1,what's the point?!?,"I don't have to listen to this to know it is hysterically bad. A tribute album for Avril?!? She's released one album and does not deserve a tribute album at this point in her career. I mean, why even bother when you can buy the original?"
5,super help,"very helpful ,and i specialy recommend for a student with ESL.Very clear and anderstendable text.Iportant that book covers the subject."
4,It's a great reference book.,"I enjoyed this book very much, and I placed it on my reference book shelf. It provided me with enough important information for my studies. It is clear, concise,and eloquent. It provides the reader with excellent visual illustrations, in addition to a thorough and necessary information about the human anatomy and physiology all in plain english."
2,Review of Essential Tangos,"Unfortunately, this music sounds a great deal far away from the Buenos Aires of Carlos Gardel !This is a light-weight recording of some famous 'Tangachos', well known to every tango-lover.I regret that they did not capture the Spirit of the Realtango !"
4,Great Songs of the 50's and 60's,"As the previous reviewer stated, these songs don't cover the 20th century of American music. If however, you enjoy the music of the 50's and 60's, especially doo wop, you will enjoy this CD. It contains 25 songs which are readily available on other CD's, and if you don't have already have them, this would provide you with great songs from this time period. To call the CD ""The Millennium's Greatest Hits"", however, is a stretch, because it contains nothing of Irving Berlin or George M. Cohan who would most certainly have songs included if the CD was truly ""the millennium's greatest hits."" However, songs such as Sherry, Happy Together, Earth Angel, Little Star, The Great Pretender, Blue Moon, My Girl, You Belong to Me, and Come Go With Me are some of the memorable songs that are included. Songwise, you won't be disappointed. However, if you expect earlier songs than the 50's, it would be best for you to try something else."
2,Not for me,"I bought this book in preparation for a recent trip to Paris. I'm an experienced traveler, but I hadn't been to France in many years. For some reason I allowed myself to get sucked into the whole French ""mystique"" and felt that I needed more advance work than I normally put in before a trip. This book was part of that effort.IMHO, the book had some useful tips, but what I disliked most was the feeling that I was being talked down to. I will acknowledge some differences in style also - I'm not a backpacker, but I'm generally more of a Lonely Planet kinda girl."
5,Definitively informed and informative,"The latest title in Brassey's outstanding ""Battles in Focus"" series, Dein Bien Phu 1954 focuses upon one of the most significant post-World War II defeats that the French military experienced. An epic conflict between the French and the nationalist forces of the Viet Minh, the conflict began in November 1953 and ended in May 1954 with the collapse and capture of the last garrison outpost held by French forces, setting the stage for their expulsion and directly paving the way for the Americas who intervene in the Vietnamese civil war on the side of the South Vietnamese government. Definitively informed and informative, Dein Bien Phu 1954 is a seminal addition the growing library of 20th Century Military History in general, and the Vietnam conflict in particular."
2,On and Off,"The product works sometimes. Unfortunately, I park in my garage all of the time. If you're looking for a product to solely rely on, this is not it. It looks good but the functionality doesn't match."
1,park zone pz1100,I have one of the older models which works beautifully. This particular one does not work well at all. Wish I had one of the older models.
3,Battery hog,"It works very nicely to help with accurate parking. I am not upset at how it actually works, but the battery usage is unreal. The book states that batteries should last up to a year, but I have to change them every 6-8 weeks. It is getting expensive. I wish I could plug it in."
1,Terrible battery life,After owning it for less than 6 months we'd changed batteries twice in it... we gave up on it and just visually align our parking because we're sick of changing the batteries. It's claim of 1 year battery life is no where close to accurate.
2,Park Zone from Amazon did not work.,Had purchased one previously as a gift which they used for years with no problems. It quit working so purchased this one as a gift again and it would not sense the vehicle. So am returning the item today. Will probably order another to see if it was just a defect with mine.
3,Not so comfortable,"They are very nice looking shoes but they are a little tight in my toes, so I can use them not for long hours."
4,Bad picture,"Amazon put up the wrong picture on this drill holster since there is a 4 bit holder on the side, which is quite useful. This item works as advertised, however it would be great if it had a small pocket on the side with the bit holder on top of that to hold extra bits. Overall a very good product"
4,Dewalt ds120 drill holster,DeWalt D5120 Ballistic Nylon Universal Drill HolsterThe drill holster works great when on a ladder and you need a place to put your drill so it stays within reach. Rugged and made well. Amazon has these at a good price too.
2,MY DRILLS WEDGE IN THIS HOLSTER,I don't care much for this holster. I have two different Dewalt drills and they both wedge in the holster when they tilt forward. It makes it very hard to pull the drill out. I spend a lot of time trying to adjust the holster so it will release my drills! Before you buy this look at theDEWALT DG5120 Heavy-duty Drill Holster. It fits the drill MUCH better.
4,looks like a great product,"got it for free with a drive/drill purchase, pro use, no much value to me"
2,Very Disapointing,"I bought this juicer after doing some research, and reading several positive reviews. Now I wonder if these people really are using their juicer on a daily basis or just once a year.I have three problems with this Juicer:1) The spout is very small. I have to cut up my apples into 6 pieces before I can feed it through.2) After one glass of juice, I have to clean it out and remove the pulp.3) But the biggest disspointment was that it started rattleing and making such a HUGE noise, that I had to turn it off.I called the company and they said that sometimes the spout it to close to the blade. They suggested that I send it in, of course at my expense.I am shopping for a new juicer, one that ejects the pulp and I dont have to clean in-between juicing.I would not recommend this juicer."
1,This juicer is hazardous!,"I bought this juice from my local health food store a couple of months ago. I should have done more research before buying it.A few folks have commented about the off-balance spin cycle effect of this juicer. I thought that would just be a minor issue. I've since discovered that it's anything but minor. When off balance, the whole juicer literally jumps around the counter, vibrating out of control. It's more than just a big racket. When it happens, I can't even get to the on/off switch, so I have to unplug it to get it to stop. By then I have a real mess on my hands. It's downright scary when this happens. I am apparently not skilled enough to consistently feed this juicer with the right size or balance of fruits and vegetables. I've decided to quit using the juicer, just out of safety concerns."
1,Don't but this Juicer,I've been juicing for 40 years.....this is the worst juicer I have ever owned.......It constantly vibrates and makes a loud noise and will vibrate walk off your counter if you turn your back on it for a second....I called omega and they did not offer to help fix the problem in any way.....Suckie Company and Suckie Juicer....don't but it and get ripped off.....
1,Terrible,I got this juicer for my birthday. EVERYTIME I use it I have to unplug it and hold it down because it vibrates and spins everywhere making a HUGE mess. My husband spent alot of money on this and I am SO dissapointed. It just doesnt work. I wish I had researched it and bought a better one but now I am stuck with one I cant even use.
2,Jumps and gets off balance,I have had this juicer for 8 years. It is a good juicer but I am now looking for another one because I'm just tired of it getting off balance and walking across the counter.Con: Too short to fit regular glass under the juicer (have to use a short glass)easily gets off balance - can't juice more than 4 ounces with out it getting off balanceWalks across the counterSmall ChuteLoudPros: good tasting juiceNot much frothIf you are an experienced juicer I would not recommend this juicer. It's been sturdy but the overall performance is cumbersome and time consuming not to mention frustrating.
1,Omega come back to the 80s quality!!!!!,"I know omega juicers since the 80s. They use to be sturdy, long lasting.Now they are consumer, disposable products. manufactured with ""fair"" and ""low"" standards. They use plastic that do not last long and is too lightweight for the task. That is why people got the weird problems when juicing with this model -juicer dancing or spitting the pulp-. It was not used to be with the 80s omega juicer.ACME juicer is USA made, a better choice. Also some other brands made in Europe and -funny- latinamerica, are better choices.Omega, your master business plan of selling short lasting products will not work out."
1,Not the best.,"We bought the Omega 1000 several years ago and discovered the problem with it going out of balance. Thought it was something we had to put up with to have a ""good juicer"". It was put into storage for awhile when we opened the box we discovered the two clamps that lock the top to the base had cracked off. It was packed in bubble wrap so I know it didn't bump into any thing and it wasn't too tight either. I opened it up to see how they were attached and discovered the mounting holes had also fractured and were falling apart. It seems to be a manufacturing defect, will contact the company to see if they will replace it or at least the housing."
4,Good book for fair-to-middlin' players,"I like this book.It has hymns arranged in playable keys for guitar (none of those gol-durned 'golf clubs' in the key signature). You get the hymns with music and chords. One thing that I like is that most of the hymns have older, more original words than the hymnal that we use at church (Hymns For The Family Of God), and usually all of the verses.The selection of hymns is good."
1,so so book at best,"Not at all what I was hoping for. This would be better if they wrote a melody line instead of the two part vocal harmony. After all, it is called Great Hymns for Guitar, not vocal. I might be able to use it as a referenc to rewrite some of the music for guitar solos, but a hymnal will probably work better for that. Overall, a disappointment. Poorly arranged, and not in any style I would use for playing in church."
5,Great selection and variety of levels,"I bought this book for my husband who has been playing the guitar for almost a year. Although none of them are difficult, there are some songs he can play now and some he can grow into--perfect for a learning musician. It has a great selection of mostly familiar hymns! Highly recommended."
4,Enjoyable,"this is nice to have. it hasn't become a favorite yet, but some of the pictures are really beautiful. the idea of passing our family history is wonderful and this is a great aid to jump start teaching your children their ancestry."
5,Wonderful next step for elementary-aged kids,"I LOVE this Bible. The writing is beautiful, the insight rich and thought-provoking. Highly recommended as a next step after beginner-type Bible storybooks. Note: There are some lovely illustrations here, but unlike the Golden Children's Bible, they are very few and far between. This is a Bible for children who do not need pictures to follow the story."
5,The Child's Story Bible,"This is the best child's story bible printed, true to the word of God and a great teaching tool for raising children in the faith. I was thrilled to find it still in print."
4,You better get this,This is the first book that I'd run across on record label marketing. I am so glad I bought it. It not only gives you ways to market your label but explains the benefits of doing so. This book is great...there are copies of the different charts so that the reader can become familiar with them. The author also directs the reader to other sources for additional information. I suggest you pick this one up asap!
4,One of the Best Books available,I got this book along with Artist Ceo: The Indie Record label guide at musicbrains.net and the Future of Music and found those books to be very complementary and productive.
1,Too Many Errors,"This book is very frustrating. There are many errors in the practice Math section that make it difficult for someone who is trying to brush up on their math skills to follow. There are also a fair number of errors in the practice tests on the CD as well. Not to mention that the program errors out sometime when you go from section to section, forcing you to start from scratch.Very disappointing and unacceptable for a book that costs $32. Save your time and money and buy a different prep book."
2,multiple errors but still solid advice,"I bought this book in preparation for an upcoming ACT test only to find that even in just the Diagnostic Assessment Test there were numerous errors. I was bewildered by the thought that there was actually a test prep book out there with information that can easily mislead the average person. But even though the questions may be faulty themselves, the book still does contain advice that can help improve one's ACT scores."
1,Too many errors,"I was using this book to help students prepare for the math section of the ACT. In my first day of preparation I found over a dozen errors in the math tests alone. There were problems with multiple correct answers listed, problems with no correct answers listed, and erroneous reasons given as explanations. This is the worst ACT prep book that I have seen"
5,Dinosaur Jr.'s best CD ever,"My husband is a huge Dinosaur Jr. fan and has everyone of their CDs most of which I will listen to with him, but never when I am by myself. But beyond is entirely different. It is catchy and melodic and I find myself singing the lyrics to Crumble and We're Not Alone all the time. They are definitely getting better with age!"
4,Jr.s back!,Great sound and songwriting -- it may be their best. An updated presentation of classic DJ with lots of crunch and geetar heroix--
2,"5 STARS for the original disc, 2 STARS for the ""import/extra tracks"" value","Just to make it perfectly clear, I think 'Beyond' is a brilliant album by the re-formed original lineup that harkens back to their earlier material and is certainly worthy of 5 stars. It never travels too far from my CD player. That being said, I sprung for the ""import"" version that has two extra tracks: ""Yer Son"" (a good, but not great, Dino Jr. song) and ""Tiny Town"" (40 seconds of punk riffing that could've been done by anybody). In my opinion, not worth twice (or more) the price of what the regular release is going for. Unless you're a die-hard Dinosaur Jr. completist or can find the ""extra tracks"" version at a great price, just buy the regular version and use the money saved to buy a copy of 'You're Living All Over Me', 'Green Mind' or some other early Dinosaur Jr."
4,Dinosaur likes his guitar!,"A good album, not a knock out of the park where all the songs are a hit. Never heard them before so I bought it to see what they sounded like and what they had to say. As of late I am picking some hot titles and this one at the most rates a 4 star (more like a 3.5). Noticed right away that Dinosaur Jr. main instrument is the guitar and gets to play some raunchy licks which I appreciate. But being a devoted fan of Jeff Beck, Frank Zappa, Adrian Belew, David Lindley (among others) I do not think this is better or more entertaining. Two or three songs stand up to be counted and that is the story so far. Dinosaur Jr. likes his guitar!! (nothing wrong with that!) but a long way from being a masterpiece of contemporary music. Go figure..."
2,Smoothing the edges,"2 1/2This is a more mature effort from the buzzed-out alternative rock band who hit it part-time big in the 90's. Besides for some production refinement, unfortunately that maturity does not translate much in the ways of songwriting, leaving much of what was great in their brief stride distilled into chewable bits of consciously presented comeback tracks."
3,"7 too small, 8 too big!","I really wanted for this boot to work out for me. I am a size 7 in sneakers and boots usually. Based on the advice at Warmbat.com's website I ordered a 7, and my big toe literally hurt after wearing them for only a half hour inside the house. So I returned them and got an 8...but they are too big! At first in the house they felt like they'd be okay and I wore them outside...but even with the insoles that are provided (which make my feet sweat and developed a wrinkle in them that was really uncomfortable after a few hours) they slip around on my feet. The next day my one foot was even sore in the heel (and in contrast to another review, I find them to be poorly cushioned on the bottom). So, now I can't return them, and am left trying to find an insert that might make them work. I am not feeling optimistic, though...I think I wasted my money."
2,Not so pleased,"The service and everything was fine, I just did not like the product. Instead of being cute like Uggs are (which is what I was looking for), they were big and clunky. They looked like men's work boots. I hated them."
5,Way better than Uggs!,Great boot! Well made! Strong and durable for any type of weather condition! Comfy and stylish! Affordable and well worth the price!
4,too wide for ladies if your feet are narrow,"I did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect. However, the unisex width is way too wide for me. I have a pair of Ugg men's Ultimate and they are not as wide.Overall, I still think Uggs are a little better and more comfortable."
2,sent 1 boot wrong size!,"nice boots, soft, warm inside, but too bad they sent me two different sizes! i have 11.5 mens, and they sent me a mens 11 and a mens 12 and i ordered size 12. boo hoo."
2,Saw a typo...,"Looks like this book was self published. Did not see name of publisher. Who ever edited this, did not check for typos. Not professional. The word carpet which was in the first chapter was not spelled correctly. Looked like it was typed on a typewriter...odd. Book was okay. Figured out the ending. Didn't finish it. To sad."
3,OK,I thought my students would enjoy this book more than they did. While the book provides brief glimpses of different periods in history much of it was lost on the children. They did not like the illustrations.
2,pretentious,"Although the illustrations were well-executed and fun, the writing was quite stilted. I kept thinking that the author was angling for a market. It didn't play to my children who are aged 7 and 11. They love cats and picture books, but found this story boring."
1,Too fast for me....,"I had trouble following the changes in exercises on this tape. They change too quickly and too often, and I could not get the hang of it. If you easily follow quick and frequent changes, you'll do better than I did. But I could not keep up with the quick pace and complex workout on this tape. There was'nt enough repetition for me to follow along. I like some of Richard's other tapes and dvds much better, but did not like this one at all."
1,Weird folks in here,"I really enjoyed Richards other Disco dvd. I was surprised not to like this one. First, there are really sweaty people in here. Not that you're not supposed to sweat in the video, but it was just kind of gross - especially one of the men in there with hairy pits. Then, there are two dancers in there who are obviously paid dancer talent. I'd rather not see those in Richards videos. I quit using this because even the music didn't move me and that usually gets me every time."
3,Fast Paced and Challenging!!!,"This workout DVD is good, but I don't think it's as good as Disco Sweat. This DVD is definitely fast paced and the routines change quickly. The one thing that I like about Disco Sweat is that, although it can be fast, the routines are a bit longer. Blast Off changes very quickly. It's alot of fun though and it is definitely challenging. If you want something fast paced that doesn't get boring quickly, then this is the DVD for you."
2,"Get a new camera man, Richard!","I did not like this video. The cameraman was going all over the place, filming at weird angles, focusing on people's faces instead of their feet. This made it hard to learn the constant new moves and made the video annoying to watch. Get ""Richard Simmons Blast Off! Your 20-Minute Energizing Workout Video"" instead. That one always makes me happy."
4,Not a bad cd.,I puchased this cd for one song rainbow by Gene Chandler! But i listen to the entire cd and found out that i liked a lot of the songs on this cd.
4,"This book ""predicted"" the extensive technology advances on t","I read this book in the late 1970s and my trying to find a copy of it. The author is as I recall a wave theorist. He analyzes the technological growth of the late 19th C and predicted that in the late 1980s there would be a series of breakthroughs of comparable magnitude. If anyone out there would like to converse on this subject, reach me at prf@world.std.com."
1,I loved Tigger until it died a week or so after use,"I telephoned Amazon - spent 30 minutes or so on the telephone waiting for a sales rep who then assured me it would be taken care of - not taken care of - decided to pack it up and put it in the attic; however, will NEVER purchase something like this again - due to the poor customer service."
3,mild yellow mostly looks white,"well i just recieved this bulb today, it was yellow and advertised as such but when i installed it it was white light, not yellow...i know it was not the shippers fault but it was not even close to what i percieve as yellow...oh well better luck next time, shipping was fast and all was good though."
4,"Good for the price, but I wanted more yellow","These are very nice bulbs. I like them a lot but I wish they were a deeper yellow in color. I wanted a real deep yellow for my fog lights and these look more like a light-yellow color. Still very good bulbs and very bright. They light the road nicely, and I can see way better with them for sure. Wish they were deeper yellow is all."
5,Work as Expected,"I installed these in the stock fog lights that came on my older Jeep Cherokee. With winter here, it's really nice to have working fog lights to help shine some extra light on the road low and wide where the headlights miss. Not much to say here really, they're quality 55W bulbs made by a reputable company, and you can't beat the price. As another reviewer stated they are not an intense 'ion yellow' type color, but more of a subdued yellow like that of old headlights- only much brighter of course. Just fine with me. They arrived quickly and I appreciated the simple packaging- easy to open and minimum waste. Very satisfied."
4,Not as yellow as I thought it would be,"The lights work great; they are bright and have held up well on a motorcycle. They just don't appear to be very yellow, in fact no one who has seen them though that they were yellow. There is a yellow tint to the bulb when you look at it when it is turned off, but as soon as you power it up, it looks to be a white bulb. Go figure!"
3,not yellow!,"seem like decent bulbs but they dont look remotely yellow, basically look like a oem replacement to me. do not recommend if you're going for a deep yellow color typically found in fog light bulbs."
1,disappointed in color,"Other reviews pale to describe just how yellow these lights aren't. They literally look like a 1980s sealed beam, or a normal lamp with weak power. If they were not already installed, I would send them back on principle alone. It's a lot of $ to spend on something that doesn't do what you wanted it to do.I realize that the fogs of today are a brighter yellow than the medium yellows of yesteryear. But this doesn't even fit today's typical color temp. It's like a really well-lit manilla file folder."
2,"ordered 2, 1 has already burned out (less than 2 months use)","I've had good luck with Hella products in the past. I needed some new fog light bulbs so I ordered a set. Received them in early august, installed them about a week later. It's now about mid october and one of them is out. Can't return it because it's only got a 30 day return window.It's unlikely that I'll spend extra money on fog light bulbs in the future.They aren't even really that yellow. Kind of like the yellow you see on a really old car with old work out headlights."
1,Do NOT buy,"I purchased two of these bulbs to put in my fog lightsThey burnt out after a month or two of useI thought Hella is quality product, but apparently not!Good thing, Amazon has really good customer service!"
2,1 of 2 bulbs lasted 3months,"I bought these in hopes that the yellow tint/light emitted would significantly stand out in rain, fog, snow, and in night driving (basically whenever driving visibility is reduced). My intentions are so that my lights would stand out against all the other cars on the road with lights on.I was disappointed to find that the yellow seemed more like a ""dulled out"" white light. Much like the light intensity of a dying headlight in a old car; quite dim looking. This definitely wouldn't stand out against any other common car white lights on the road.Not only was it not very yellow, one of the 2 bulbs died withing 3months of use. I bought this in November. Installed and used all of December, January, and February. In March, one of the bulbs burned out.At the time, I purchased these for $5.50 each bulb. Considering today, I probably would not purchase Hella H3 bulbs again, assuming it's a manufacturer's issue and seek some other intese yellow bulbs."
4,Jersy Girls EP,This album completely rocks out in all the best ways. It is incredible! And the cover work is totally Seaside boardwalk.
3,Many examples with a bit too much talk,"This is actually an excellent text as a supplement for students of advanced calculus. There are many simplified examples and a lot of explaination, perhaps too much. The author starts with logic, which is good since most students have difficulty with understanding the contrapositive, converse, and proof by contradiction. He gives a lot of information on the subjects that are covered (there are a good number of subjects not covered) and talks (perhaps rambles) a lot on these subjects. However if you could dig through the jargon and appreciate a bunch of nice examples and fundamentals this is a book for you. I didn't look at the CD."
1,NOT A BOOK! One Page Review!!! UGH!!,"What were they thinking?? Why bother? I had already done my research and wanted the book, why are they selling a reveiw and not the actual item?? I will definately pay more attention before I click next time."
3,"Nice, but could be better","I really wish this book had the pronunciation of the different items for non korean reading parents. Also, the images are all hand illustrated in a style that my two-year-old can't always easily identify even in english..."
2,Confusing and poorly written,"A re-hashed book with a poor effort to update for digital photography. I found it very difficult to read. There was very little new information for any serious amateur, e.g. ""What is a pixel?"" and other useless tidbits for anyone who has some experience (which I'm assuming is the target audience). There was only one chapter where I found any new information. If you're looking for film specific stuff, this might be your book; it has thousands of development time charts, paper type references and other film centric information. My guess is that most of the potential buyers are using digital.I was mad at myself that I wasted so much time trying to wade through this book. Save your money, read Ansel Adam's ""The Negative"" to hear it in the master's words and then search the internet for any of the well written papers on the digital zone system (search on Chuck Gardner Digital Zone System for a favorite)."
5,Totally Impressed with these Binoculars,I have only just recieved these and am totally blown away with how great they are. Tested just before dusk and everything i looked at was amazingly sharp and clear. Just move to each new thing and it's instantly in sharp focus. I love the size and feel of them and can't wait to to use them for nature watching and any sports games that i go to.
4,Awesome binoculars,"I bought these for my father who likes to watch animals in the wild. He loved them and the clarity. Just from the roadside he will spot deer, fox etc....and enjoys them very much"
5,A Classic,"I'm pretty sure this is a book I remember reading as a child. It was about a witch who had upgraded to using a vacuum cleaner instead of a broom. It doesn't work very well and she abandons it, and two girls find it and use it for all sorts of adventures. I thought it was wonderful. It deserves to be reissued. I'm surprised it hasn't with all the fuss about Harry Potter."
1,Picture NOT same product you get,"I thought I was getting the original book but this is a cheapy scholastic edition. That was a let down. After more research I should known an original is super expensive. ""Too good to be true"", Got a thin book with a white cover that was half the number of pages the original. Maybe seller should have pictured the right book. It was a childhood favorite when I was ten, now 40. Just wanted to pass the memories onto my child. This sub didn't have the same magic like the original did. It was a gift that I had built up, no time to complain-return. Just won't ever order from this seller ever again."
4,The Wednnesday Witch: A Review,"While this book is now out of print, it is worthwhile doing a bit of legwork and try to track down a copy. Elementary school children (and very often their parents) enjoy the adventures that the female protagonist manages to get herself mixed up in. A talking cat named Cinders, magic scissors that minimize everyone and everything, a flying vacuum cleaner and a dollhouse all combine to make this novel a fun read for both male and female children."
5,the wednesday witch,"what a way for a city kid like me to discover the power of the written word!the author, ruth chew, turned everyday objects into marvels of magic- a household vacuum cleaner that flies over new york!fabulous!there's nothing more realistic, believable and at the same time --sublime than an old vacuum cleaner that comes to life... i grew up pining for my own personal magic vacuuum cleaner. simply marvelous reading."
4,Great Rangefinder for golf,"I bought this rangefinder for golf. It is small enough that I could keep it in my pocket. It really helps me with the approach shots to the greens. It takes a bit of experience to be able to focus on the flag. I usually use a person on the green as my target. After I got an approximate read, I use the scan mode to find the exact distance to the flag. Be careful with the tiny battery cover. It came loose and I lost it on the golf course. Fortunately, I recovered it amongst the green grass. The cover is also green. I now put a tape over it to secure the cover.Additional comment: I have used it for about nine months. It has become my 15th club. However, battery life is rather short. Make sure you carry a spare."
5,The top aid for the golfer,"It is light; has 6X magnification; and easy to use. This little tool is great for any golfer. You must know the yardage before you can select the correct club. How far is it to either the top of that bunker next to the green or the flagstick? Next,you just then need to pull the club that will get you there. Fits on your belt through a loop in the safe carrying case or use the supplied clip to attached the case to your golf bag. These NEW laser rangefinders are better than ever and at a lower price than previous models. LOVE IT!"
4,Good Product,"I really hedged between a sky caddie and a rangefinder. I've used both now and the convenience of a sky caddie is hard to beat with a constant readout of yardage. However, given the fact that I often find myself in ""unique"" locations on any given course, there is much to be said for being able to shoot a specific target to get a distance, which the sky caddie doesn't allow you to do. Sometimes you need odd distances for lay ups, getting the ball back in play, etc. In short, I would recommend this product. It's easy to use, and appears to be very accurate. A definite time saver on the course."
3,So so,"Item arrived quickly, but I was disappointed with its usage. It was fine for measuring to a sand trap or people on the green but I could seldom get range to the flag. I am going to return the item and pay more for a better one."
2,Not quite what I was hoping.,"I play executive courses in Florida and many of these are located in housing developments. Flags are frequently in front of houses and or trees. It is difficult to obtain the correct yardage for these holes. There also is very little support on how to align on the target whether it is the flag, flag pole, front of green, etc. My iGolf GPS unit is much more useful."
5,Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout Rangefinder,"I liked it. It is compact and light, and it works like it is supposed to. I use it for golf, and I can read range to a flag to about 70 yards, with the distance limitation being the steadiness of my hand.When buying this, I was influenced by previous reviewers. They did a good job."
4,ok,"This rangefinder seems to work flawlessly. I have no complaints about it. However I will never buy another bushnell product again. They have the worst customer service I have ever seen. I bought a brand new scope off of them to find out that it's defective. It's got a ""lifetime warranty"" so I sent it back to them and they said that there was a problem with the image erector and they said that they wouldn't cover the warranty on it because it was my fault. I only used the thing one time and I'm always careful with my scopes. So that was 150 bucks down the drain. So buy a bushnell if you want but don't expect them to help you out if it breaks. I would recommend nikon instead."
2,It can be easily broken.,"You should make sure to hold tight this yardage during the game. If you drop it on the course, it can be broken and the Bushnell repair center tell you it is outside the warranty.It works great within your hands, but when it falls from your hand, it goes out of order."
5,Ride with Abel Jones,"In this, the third volume in this magnificent chronicle, Owen Parry lets us ride along with Major Abel Jones as he travels into enemy territory to investigate a series of brutal murders.By the time you have fought your way through the Battle of Shiloh alongside Abel Jones, you will have developed some appreciation for the barely controlled chaos that characterized most Civil War battles. The account of Jones'subsequent adventures will provide you with an appreciation for the principal characters in this series. They continue to develop as you become more familiar with each of them; just as they would if we were truly a part of their world.I have already reserved a space on my bookshelf for the next book by Owen Parry."
3,Decent recipes. Not much else.,"Read this in an hour. Front and middle of the book are mostly warnings of what can go wrong with a bad diet. Some examples thrown in. But I can get that from a warning label and I already know that these things are not good, (Don't give the kids, chips, soda or candy for example. Kind of obvious.). I wanted more specifics about what and how to eat for a healthy kids diet. The recipes are the back third of the book. Some are inventive but nothing I could not find online. Honestly based on the title and all the stellar reviews, I was expecting something much more. I will try some of the recipes and for that I give the book three stars."
4,Healthy book,I actually bought this book as a gift and am hoping they are reading it. In this fast paced world we live in today I worry about young children's health.
4,My second copy,I bought this book for my daughter and her family. I misplaced mine that I was going to send her.
2,maybe a bit extreme?,"While I do not have children suffering from the afflictions that Dr, Fuhrman seems to have helped with, I feel that this book advocates a diet that may be too extreme for most people. That he is a physician who states many of his ideas as certainties also bothered me. I do think that some of his ideas could be incorporated into a healthier diet than many families are currently following, but maybe some moderation would make his ideas even more popular."
1,A bit too radical,"This book had some good ideas. However, the author's tone is more than a little pushy and some of his assertions seem suspect to me. Lines like ""cheese should not be kept in the house"" on page 34 led me to remove this book from my house."
5,Amazing Book,This is a must read for all parents and physicians. Dr. Fuhrman explains in plain english how to keep you and your children healthy for now and your lifespan with the simple vehicle of sound nutrition. He dispells most mainstream misinformation that is still provided to the general public with correct information that is unfortunatly not widely talked about in mainstream media/America.
5,Revisiting An Old Movie Favorite,"Sometimes it's revealing to go back in time, and watch a film that meant something to me years ago. Casey's Shadow is one of several I have bought and watched again. Try it. It's interesting to see if your values are still the same.It's nice also to see Walter Matthau in a role different from the comedic characters he generally played. Buying from Amazon.com and their customers, is fast and easy."
4,Worth the money,This movie was good for a couple reasons. One it was well written and two it has a good leading cast. The director did a good job presenting the material so people who don't care about horses should still enjoy this film.
4,An all time underated film,"Matthau is perfect for the part of the grizzled, Louisiana horse trainer. The story has a deeper insight that a lot of people don't realize. I use this in my classroom and at the end ask the students what would you have done? We all, whether we admit it or not dream of our one moment of glory. The question is how far would we go to have it. This movie gives an excellent example of this as well as being a great film for lovers of horses, racing, or Walter Matthau. Funny yet insightful."
4,one of my all time favorites,"I saw this movie for the first time over ten years ago. It is a wonderful story about a family without a mother and how all they have is each other. Mathau does a wonderful job of portraying the overbearing father who wants his one more shot at fame, no matter who he hurts. This movie is actually based on a jockey who still races today! If you enjoy horses, family, and the thrill of almost having it all, this movie is for you. Enjoy!"
5,One of the best horse movies ever made,"The ""Rocky"" of all horse movies. For those of us who dreamed of being the best but never had the money or the chance Casey's Shadow is as close as it gets. An excellent family movie but Walter Matthau says a lot of cuss words. Best oneliner from the movie, ""I'd sell my private parts for medical research before I went on welfare."" (Or something like that.) It's a great movie!!"
1,not for kids,"I bought this movie thinking that it would be a good family movie. Boy was I wrong! It has ALOT of foul language. My kids are 10,7,3. At the time of viewing they were two years younger. They love horses and I would not let them watch it again because of the language. I had to quickly slip it into the donation box. If you have kids and are strict about bad language this movie is not for you as a family flick."
2,parts,Parts kit seemed to be the correct one but it came with the incorrect bearing so the lit is no good to me. This is the kit the manufacturer recommends for this pump.
2,Wayne PC4 Repair Kit,"I was satisfied with the speed of delivery but had problems with the brushes included in the kit. The brushes broke off the spring shortly after installations. The rest of the parts were good, but I believe the brushes were old. I sent an e-mail to the company 4 days ago and have heard no response."
2,Not really pleased,"Using the correct numbers from the pump, I ordered and recieved a kit for repair.What I was sent was a kit with the wrong bearings and motor brushes.I was told nothing could be done for me. At least the impeller, which was the major part that I needed was the correct fit, so I am able to use the pump.NO, I am not satisfied."
5,Ionic pro,"This is the second machine I have purchased. The first one ran day and night for years. I have several allergies, including one to mold and mildew. I keep the PurePro running in my home constantly. I have IonicPro minis running in the bedrooms. Since I have been using the machine,my allergies are much better. I am so happy I do not take allergy shots any more, and hardly have to use medication. When I do it is because I have been outdoors during pollen season. I recommend the PurePro to anyone who has allergies, it really makes a difference."
4,Challenging,If you love a challenge then you will love this. I love the fact you have the option to make certain decisions.
4,Excellent Game,"I bought this game, and it was in good shape, have not had any problems with it. Great game overall."
3,Great product,Good game. I played it and found that it was not one on Tom Clancy's best work. At worst it is still entertaining.
1,??????????????????????????????????????????????????,"What file type is this????? I've tried every file type that my computer will read and had no luck. This is no way to market a product. As James Allen states in this book (that I've yet to here from this CD) ""What you sow you will reep.""Disappointed in my purchase."
5,Amazing reference book,"This is an amazing reference book for collectors of costume jewelry, which contains a huge number of producers and their products. Also with approximate price range. Definitely worth purchasing! DK as usual did a very good job, just as they do with their well-known travel guides."
4,Costume Jewelry (DK Collector's Guides),"I was referred to this book by a friend who has been collecting vintage jewellery for over 30 years as I wanted to learn more about the vintage jewellery I was now starting to collect. It is very informative for the novice collector, well set out and has beautiful photographic examples of pieces from each designer and period. I would recommend this book if you are looking to start collecting or to use as a reference guide for particular vintage jewellery styles. The only criticism is the pricing is way off but this could be the result of the book being a little out of date."
5,Another great Judith Miller Book!,"Judith Miller has done it again with her glossy pictures and informative data on all the main designers in vintage jewelry. This book gives a great synapsises on all the jewelry greats.This book is wonderful and easy to read for a quick reference. I would recommend this book along with the Miriam Haskell book for any jewelry collector.This book has taught me so much, just as her others. Thanks again for another great book!"
3,love 'em,"I love these frickin' boots. They were a little pointier than they looked in the picture, but I love stomping around in them. They look especially good with longer skirts."
3,Thorough,"This book is thorough, but not a riveting read. However, the number of pages aren't as daunting as you might think, there are a lot of tables and charts."
3,Ok but not great,"Bought this for a class; helpful in some areas but not in others. Lots of blank forms and examples if you're into checklists, but I don't know that it will be terribly practical for me. I work in a small K-12 district; maybe it would be more useful for larger districts."
4,don't buy at amazon!,"It's a pretty good gauge, although it doesn't always form an easy seal with the tire valve. Most importantly, I found this exact model for $9.95 at Target, so don't buy it here."
1,Not everyone is happy...,"Great idea, gauge no workie! No instructions for re-setting (not Zero set) just -0.0 staring back at me. Worse! No website with which to lodge a complaint or ask for help (even though it's not rocket science). C'mon guys, it's 2003! I must be one of the unlucky ones or just unbearably grumpy."
2,Broken already!,"I have had one for about maybe 2 months and it is already broken. The LCD screen is displaying some garbage such as --.00 anything when I go use it on my tires. I haven't been rough with it, I havent dropped it, run over it with my car, etc. I leave it in my glove compartment and one day it decided not to work.I was trying to find the website or a phone number for the company to see if I could get a replacement, but to no avail. I would not recommend this product."
1,Poor Battery Life,My definition of Lifetime Batteries is different than Accutire's. Not being able to replace the batteries in this simple gauge is a joke.
3,A good start,"Each chapter in this book is devoted to a different topic: language, culture, cooperation, sex, among others. Each one of these topics can be covered by itself in a whole book. Given that, the book does not tell you much about each topic. Second, even though the title of the book is stone age present, most of the experimental work discussed in the book is from nonhuman primate studies. The book is however interesting, easy-to-read, and a good start for non-academics."
1,No Clue,"I had to laugh at Ron and Kerry who obviously do not have a clue what the Mormon church teaches. I have not read this book, but until you understand the LDS religion, keep your thoughts to yourself!"
4,Interesting Look at History.,I have read many of Well's books and have enjoyed all of them. This is an interesting look at a huge subject. I like that it includes information on things other than just a history of wars.
3,Fascinating view from the 1920s,"I read this book to get a quick overview of history, and it does provide that from a 1922 point of view. Fascinating to see what he got right and wrong in looking forward to our times. The book reads easily, but with quaintly different use of some words which now have different meanings.This book was written from a particular political point of view, and this means we need to be aware of this in the earlier chapters, as it only becomes obvious later."
3,Good book,I somewhat enjoyed reading this one. It talks about the rise and fall of empires which becomes quite monotonous and disheartening because humans have repeated the same mistakes over and over again.
1,My Least Favorite HG Wells book,"This is the only scholarly work I have written by HG Wells and I regret it. We can forgive him the inaccuracies of the natural history section of this book. We have 90 years of scientific advancement since them and it's accurate enough for what thre information avilable at the time.I will also grant that I learned a great deal about the orgins of different nationalities by tribe in Europe. How many peopl actually know that Russians were decended from Vikings? Certainly not me.No, the tough part to get through was the upper class English snobbery. I can't tell you how many times I read the words ""brown people"" and ""savages""...ugh.Stick to Wells' fiction."
5,Works on 93 Ford Sport Trac,"I first bought the one shown for a 93 Ford Sport Trac.....Sent it back and bought this one, which says its not for my 93 Ford Sport Trac but for 92 and older, well....this is the one for my 93....works great....15 min to install."
5,Cruise control switch,"I bought this to replace the switches on my wife's 2000 Explorer. I haven't installed them yet but the price was right and, assuming they work as advertised, will be very happy with this purchase."
4,Good and Economical Solution to an Ugly Problem,"I'm a Detroit style cruise control maestro, and I wore out the cruise control buttons on my 2000 Ford Explorer 100K miles ago. A colleague spotted the mess on my steering wheel and told me to look for this product. I'm really happy with the result. Installation was harder than I expected, because the harness routing was done at the factory at a point that required more disassembly than I wanted to do. Notes from the Internet and the Haynes manual were remarkably useless, but another post here hints at a better strategy: leave the factory ribbon cable harness in place, and just replace the switches at left and right. I have a second 2000 Ford Explorer (long story) that has developed the same problem, so I'm ordering another kit and will report back on the results."
1,Nice concept if it only would work.,The attachment stopped working within 5 minutes after juicing less than 10 oranges (appeared to have stripped gears). Hopefully I just happened to get a defective product as it has been sent back for replacement. The unit does not appear to be very well made. Not too impressed thus far.
4,Love it.,We have a orange tree so when we do squeeze we squeeze a lot. This attachment has worked great and I recommend it
2,Not as interesting as the web site,"I guess I just don't get it. I've owned this book for years and can't bring myself to finish it. I've visited the site a few times, and the writings are good. The material seems to lose its impact in printed form, however."
1,title says it all...,"thought this might be an interesting book on the rise and fall of a pop-culture ezine, but I couldn't get past page 15. Save you money for n-sync's next record..."
3,Poor quality all around - but OK table.,"Felt and rails are poor quality. Table arrived with rail material cracked and ripped and cup holders not securely fastened. Felt started to get fuzzy from light touch. Not even a game has been played.But - if you are looking for a second table when hosting larger games, this makes a great 2nd table. It may be unclear from the discription, but this is a tri-fold table - with one seam on the playing surface.I used gift certificates to purchase this item - otherwise I would be very disappointed & would have returned it. It should be priced around $50 - $65 max. I bought it as a 2nd table and it should serve the purpose - so it gets an ""ok"" 3 stars"
2,good looking table but poor quality,"When I first opened this item, it looked great, but after closer inspection, it was very poorly crafted. The vinly on the bottom was peeling off and the vinly cushion/rail had rips in it. Once laid flat on the table, the rips are barely noticeable, but the the tabletop itself feels cheap. Felt top padding was very soft and left an indention when you pressed on it. The fold on one side of the tri-folds has a slight raise to it when laid flat, giving it a ramp/mound feel. I have tried to press it flat but it does'nt seem to do much good.At the $130 price, it is not worth it, but if you can find it for $75, it is ok and worth it if you need a couple of side tables to go along with your premium MAIN table. On a POSITIVE note, it is still better then any other folding table top out there, just wished it was a little better quality...i am trying to return the one i purchased for a better/non cracked/ripped one, but the manuafactuer has not yet replied."
4,Nice Folding Table,"Fit perfectly on our kitchen table. Nice quality. Came w/a strap to secure when folded. Only thing that would have been better is if it came w/a storage bag. Overall,it worked out great for our friendly game of poker at our Christmas party."
5,Great Product,The speed in which I got it was unbelievable. Good product I use it weekly and I have nothing but good things to say about it and my dealings with Amazon.Gary Backlund
5,Happy,"DVD was used but worked very well, no scratches. It made my daughter very happy that I found it. Thank you"
5,Perma focus,"I use these in hunting situations where game has to be identified quickly. Its great not to have to fiddle with focusing. You can scan large areas of land very quickly with this great piece. The image seems to be a little less precise than my insta-focus Bushnells, but its good enough to handle 99% of what most people would require."
2,Description error,"Amazon list the FOV as 393ft@1000yds, while Bushnell website gives 341@1000yds for 17-5010 model. That would correspond to a 6.5 degree FOV instead of a 7.5 FOV, although both are large for a 10x binocular."
4,"Only for long range, no Lasik","I had a pair like this when I wore contacts and they were great.Now my eyes are 20/20 20/15, it's a no go now darn it.They also will not focus closer than 20 + or - yards.They are very clear and good binos just not for me.Longboard"
2,Perma Focus doesn't hold up to expectations,"It already got a pair of 7x21 compact binoculars and wanted these ones for bird watching. Unfortunately these ones don't give a sharp image, not even at greater distance to the object. Because they are ""Perma"" focus there is no way of focusing them to closer objects, let's say 30 feet away. In general, I would not recommend them."
4,Sharp,"Impressed with the perma focus technology. Allows more light than ambient conditions at dawn/dusk, which is a big plus when hunting. Good value for the $!"
2,Soft and unsupportive,"I've used this pillow since it arrived a couple of days ago. It is heading for a guest bedroom or the trash. There is nothing wrong with it IF you like an extremely soft pillow that totally squishes down under your head. It is well made and looks like it will last.I was dubious of choosing a pillow I couldn't feel before purchase. I should have paid attention to my doubts. Now I'm heading to Costco and Bed, Bath and Beyond where I can feel what I may purchase."
2,not enough support,This pillow seems like it does not have enough density to properly support my head. I don't use it anymore.
3,what happened?,Liked the first one so much that I bought another recently and the new one has a strange and unpleasant odor that comes through a pillowcase. Am hoping that airing it out will help...
3,Not Very Different,"To me this pillow is pretty much like any other pillow I've had, and I've bought many different kinds, only this one is softer. I really don't see any difference with my allergies, as to the severity. They are still bad.It's fine as a regular pillow. That's all it is, at least to me."
4,Allergen-free pillows,I gave these pillows to my son for Christmas. He said they were a bit different to get used to but he loves them!
4,"Pretty good,","I ordered this CD awhile ago because I couldn't find many of the songs on it to download, and I particularly loved the song Anyway, which stopped in the the middle of the download. So, I just decided to order the CD. Over all, I like it. The song, Dynomite Satchel Of Pain doesn't catch my interest at all, however. But the rest, I like, with Lemonade and Anyway being my favorites. Wheatus has songs that are so original with catchy tunes you get stuck in your head for hours. None of their songs sound the same. I really like this CD."
3,Just an abridged version,"I read this book in the original language as a teenager many, many years ago. The plot is compelling, and the intense narrative is absolutely riveting.However, this translation basically has only the first half of the original, and the second half is summarised in but a page worth of epilogue. All the agony after the major climax and the post-war life of the family which illustrated how the family lived as a Japanese family are missing. What a pity."
3,Good Book,"I have just perused a few parts of the book. It was recommended by another commentary, and sounded interesting, so I added it to my library. Thus far, it's been what i expected."
2,Disappointing,"I wasn't interested in reading every little detail of this woman's life during this time period, but that's what I got with this book. Not very interesting. Not a great story. Maybe it would be better having read her other book (books?) first. I dunno."
2,Works great...but too big,"Very cumbersome to use. It is so big you have use both hands to hold it steady, you also have to remove your hat because it will not fit under the bill of a golf/baseball hat. Forget about putting it in your pocket or clipping it onto your belt....you would not be able to swing. I felt like I was bird watching on the course the few times I used it...though it did provide accurate yardages."
2,Good for a few uses,"These pans lasted a little while. I hated using them because the handle got hot along with the pan. The coating ended up being scratched off, and everything stuck. They became so hard to clean I got extremely fed up and threw them all in the trash."
3,Not so bad,"The best thing about these pans is that they are very lightweight, which I like because it makes washing them easy, but they don't seem to cook all that evenly, and the food I cooked in there did stick more than I expected it to."
5,Farberware makes excellent Skillets!,"They are light of weight, which at first I was a bit suspicious of, but if you follow the directions to use medium-high heat they cook efficiently fast - and without breaking your wrist! They clean up nicely too!"
1,NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM warehouse_deals.,"Buy only if an item is offered ""directly"" by Amazon. I like Amazon service a lot and have been buying many items, but never had any issue.warehouse_deals ships incorrect products and never responds. ALL the positive feedback they get appears to be self posted from the wording used.Just a suggestion, do your diligence. I wish someone had warned me before."
4,Very pleased with this item,"I ended up getting this through a promotion for free. I am amazed by how much use I get out of them. I have experienced no problems with things sticking. They heat evenly. They clean easily. I am going easy on the coating, using the right utensils on them. Everything has been fine. Even though I have a lot of Calphalon Commercial that I use for most things, these still stay within easy reach on my potrack and are used regularly.Considering they were free they are really 5 stars, but trying to rate them against the listed price, the one problem is that they are small. These are not pans you are going to use to easily prepare a meal for the entire family."
4,Great on a shoestring,"For the gift giver; the pans are light and come in plastic-wrap. For the cook; a light pan heats and cools quickly so there will be a slight learning curve but it is much easier on the wrist and therefore, safer; the strongly rivited handle appears safe and professional; the bottom is fully relieved in alternating circles, in ridges, about 1/8"" wide and 1/16 deep - this causes rapid dispersal of heat giving more even cooking - this feature is not always found in the ""cheaper"" sets.In conclusion, it is a very good starter set for the single person, the college student, and all those on a slim budget. My wife says, ""What can you say, other than 'They sell for under [$$].'"""
4,Cheapie,"These pans DO NOT have plastic handles. How you could mistake these metal handles for plastic is beyond me. Anyway, you get what you pay for. ... The handles feel like they could break off with little abuse. They cook fine. I haven't had the set long enough to see how the non stick holds up. They are fine FOR THE PRICE. Just don't expect this set to be high quality that will last for years and years. The reason I gave them a high rating is because they are worth the low price charged. They'd be great to give a kid who is starting up their apartment, and fine for a bachelor."
4,Good Value,"Recently bought this 3-piece set to supplement some more expensives pans I was buying to replace those I have that have simply worn out. While their weight/quality was not equal to the others I bought their cost was far less. They are well balanced, of reasonable thickness with decent heat distribution and I can simply toss them in the dishwasher (not the case with the other, pricey pans I bought). For overall functionality, ease of use, and cooking performance, I thought this set was a very good value. Would recommend for easy clean up, everyday use."
2,Non stick pans,"I read the reviews but just didn't think it would sit that uneven on the surface of my stove top. Cooks pancakes, bacon and eggs fine. Cleans up well. Can't believe they can sell for that cheap; but they need to dump them some how. Next Fish?"
1,"Major Disappointment, Beware.","I bought the omega 4000 and wow major disappointment. I did not even get a chance to use it, dame thing would not even turn on not even after pressing on the reset button. I was extremely disappointed to have paid over $200 for a product that never worked. Not to mention $35 dollars I spend on retuning this product and a 10% restocking fee. All this money just to return a product that never worked to begin with I find it truly unfair. Customer Service what customer service, they did not give a dame. I would say beware."
2,Ejectors are no Use,I used Omega 1000 for about 10 years. I make juice for about 4 people every three days. In order to ake that juice you have to stop atleast six or seven times to remove the pulp. Also juicer gets unstable if you put soft stuff. So I tried Breville pulp ejector after reading the reviews. I was shocked how poorly it works. I have to stop more times to clean it as the ejector makes it a mess. Omega pulp ejector is also a poor one. I have to stop more times than Omega 1000 and also I did not get that much juice as Omega 1000.
4,Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss Cookbook,"The recipies are very tasty, but many of the ingredients are things that were not routinly kept in my home. Most of the recipies involve salads of some sort which was disappointing. On a better note most of the recipies can be completed in less than 30 minutes which is nice when you are in a rush.The book also opens with his plan for healthy eating and therefore you really do not need to buy his weight loss book as well."
4,Way a weigh to go,Thank you for prompt sending of cookbook. Will be cooking healthier with this cookbook in hand. It's a godsend. Thanks
4,Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss Cookbook,This is an interesting book with many esasy recipes. I received the book on time and in a good condition.
1,ANOTHER [CHEAT],"I was actually a client of Dr. Shapiro's and he is only interested in one thing-MONEY! He has made a nice living for himself with his books, but the nutritional education he offers is minimal and his books don't really offer anything but a fad diet. He drained my pockets, offered me disgusting powders as meal supplements and to top it off I did not lose more than 5 pounds during my entire two months as his patient. I followed his diet religiously everyday with zero result. I never reached my goal weight. I have since been successful after joining Weight Watchers and a local gym. Trust me, this book is NOT worth the money (not even for free) and I would have been better off spending my money at Barney's (across the street from his office in New York)."
5,Daughters favorite today,"Have had to buy a 2nd of these for a ""backup"" just in case the original gets lost. Daughter loves playing with the baby. Just be sure to not lose the pacifier otherwise you may have a meltdown on your hands"
3,This eight year old step grandaughter apparently isn't into dolls either.,"I couldn't resist shopping online for the convieneince since I hate to store shop. Again I wish I knew what to shop for for these kids now days. She ended up playing with our way younger grandson's cars on the floor. Oh well, thanks Amazon for being there. The doll was as cute as can be by the way."
5,Granddaughter loves this doll,"We bought this doll for my granddaughter and she loves it. Very good price, as well. I would definitely recommend this product."
4,cute doll but missing head band,"I love baby Stella. She's so cute,soft,and cuddly. I ordered one for my daughter 3 years ago and I still have it. I'm saving it for her children. I just ordered two more dolls as Christmas gifts but these two did not come with head bands like my daughter's did. I called Manhattan toys (the makers of the doll) and they stated that the peach baby Stella doesn't come with a headband. When I pointed out that my daughter's doll came with a head band and it showed it on the box, she said they needed up update the photo because peach baby Stella no longer came with a head band. She informed me that the dark baby Stella still comes with a head band though. That makes no sense to me. I was kind of disapointed that they took the head band away because it was cute."
5,Adorable!,Stella is so cute and soft.. The pictures do not do her justice!!I puchased her as a Christmas gift for my 22month old daughter. I can't wait for her to open it - I know she will love it!
5,We Love Stella!,"My daughter is now one and just starting to really get into dolls. we bought Stella when she was 8 months old, and she really didn't pay much attention to her. Now she Loves stella, she'll hug her and take her in and out of her dolly stroller. I havent given her the pacifier yet because I don't want to lose it.We like stella so much that we bought one for my cousins little girl, along with the stella backpack. Stella is soft, and snuggly, and I love her little tuft of hair! Most of all, Stella is not creepy looking, as many dolls are, and I love her velvety soft skin."
5,Huge Hit!!!,"I got this for my baby girl when she was about 6 months old. One of her favorite things to do is take the paci off and put it back on. So simple, yet so fun for her! She likes to give baby Stella hugs. Like others have pointed out, Stella is cute, not creepy like other available options for a first doll. I am very happy with my purchase."
3,Maybe for younger child,"I gave this to my granddaughter when she was 16 mo and she rarely shows interest in stella. I think the doll is so soft cute and cuddly, but I'd look silly carrying her around :-) . I eagerly sewed an outfit, but still not interested. Maybe better for one year olds. Very nice quality though ."
3,"Very cute, wish the hair was sewn better","This is an extra cute doll. It's quite a bit smaller than most and the way the pacifier sticks to the mouth with the magnet is really cute. We also got the feeding set with the bottle for the same reason. The Brunette version actually has black hair and very light skin and I think could be considered Caucasian or Asian.I would give this doll 5 stars except for the fact that after a few months the hair ties have loosened and the hair is always falling out of the little pig tails. Once the hair comes out it's difficult to get it back inside (I've had to use a rubber band to hold it in place) and it never lies flat again, it's all bunchy. My daughter says the doll's hair is 'messy' and dislikes it. I wish they sewed the pig tails into the doll so that they wouldn't shift or come out, that would solve the problem."
4,"Very cute doll, but lighter then she looks","This doll is really cute. She is soft and just right for a young girl since she has no hair that needs maintaining. I also like the fact the the company makes clothes and other items for this doll. I just wish she was machine washable, but she seems to wipe off pretty easy. She is a little lighter then she looks. not that I mind since my daughter is light skinned. I think it would be really cute for a bi-racial child aswell. But if your not color struck, then this is a good choice for first time mommys or girls that just love soft dolls."
2,Manhattan Toy Stella Doll,I decided not to give to 18 month old granddaughter because there is a magnet in the pacifer and a magnet under one layer of cloth on the doll and was afraid she would bite on it and somehow get to the magnet. I put it away untill she stops chewing on things. But it is a cute doll.
3,Very disappointed,"After researching this doll here on Amazon I decided to buy it for my daughter for Christmas. I bought the doll, changing kit and feeding kit. The doll itself is very cute and seems durable; it is soft and nice to hold. The issue I have is the clothing.The diapers hardly fit / stay on, the clothes are so tight you have to stretch them to get them attached, and they are very difficult to work with. It's hard enough for a 2 year old to change a baby's clothes without having to deal with things that are too tight and very difficult to work with. Even I am having having a hard time getting the teeny tiny diapers to stay on. Being that dressing and undressing the doll is a major part of the whole baby doll experience, I am beyond frustrated.It's too late for me to return this (since I bought it and held on to it for a gift) so that makes the problem even worse for me.I thought I had found the best, greatest baby doll for my little girl but I am very, very disappointed :("
5,Stella Doll,This gift was for my great-grand baby for her very first birthday. She loved her doll and sleeps with it every night! How am I going to top that at Christmas?Manhattan Toy Stella Doll
5,gorgeous doll,"I sent this to my great-niece... although she was a young baby her mom gave it to her daughter and she cuddled up to it right away. She loved it at a young age so I bet she is only going to grow to love it more. It is a very, very cute doll!!!"
4,Adorable,She is cute and soft. The pacifier is magnetic and comes off easily. You have to be careful as it could become a choking item. (That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars) But other than that it is a great little baby
3,Great doll,"This is a nice, soft doll for babies. My only wish is that the pacifier was attached. We lose it about once a week under a couch or down a cushion etc."
2,"Great doll, but not well made","My daughter got this doll right after her first birthday. It is a cute doll, easy for her to play with, and she likes it a lot. After 5 months, I noticed her finger stitches were coming out on one hand. I know how to sew so I fixed it. Today (we've had Stella for 6 months), I noticed her head was coming unattached! There was an inch gap between her neck and her head. Again, I know how to sew so I fixed it, but I can't believe she's coming apart so easily. My daughter is NOT rough with her so it is a factory problem. This doll would be 1000 times better if it was made to last. I'm pretty disappointed."
5,Beige is beige,"This was purchased for my daughter's first birthday. It just arrived in the mail about 10 minutes ago. Even though I am Caucasian, I do not like to buy blond haired blue eyed dolls. This doll's skin color is perfect and just what I wanted! She has a nice deep tan - same as mine, dark brown hair (not black) and brown eyes. If I had to racially classify this doll she would probably be considered Hispanic or Bi-racial. The quality is fantastic and she is very soft. My daughter's birthday is 2 weeks away and when she saw the doll she flipped out and wanted her immediately. I tried taking the doll to the other room (so I could give it to her on her actual birthday) and my daughter clearly became upset. So I removed Stella from the box and my daughter is laughing and hugging and cuddling her. I had no idea a baby could have so much fun with a doll!"
2,"Nice doll, but workmanship is questionable...","Bought this doll for my very young daughter to grow with. Was initially pleased, but within short order, the stitching up the seam of the doll's back began to unwind, leaving an ever growing hole for stuffing to come through. Inquisitive little fingers didn't help the situation. Had to take it away from her till I had time to mend it. The shoddy workmanship is real disapointment. I guess it's lucky I'm pretty good with a needle and thread, but for the money this doll cost, I shouldn't have to be!"
4,Baby Stella is GREAT - the exchange policy...nonexistent!!!,"I purchased a Baby Stella from Amazon 2yrs ago for my little girl and she LOVES her - Stella has been everywhere and has been washed a million times - still looks new.I purchased a second Stella for my niece as a Christmas gift and upon opening her, I tried to put the pacifier on only to find that it is defective. The little magnet that sits in the face of Stella is turned backwards causing the pacifier to repel. Something that ordinarily wouldn't have been a problem through Amazon has become a nightmare through one of Amazons merchants. I have no option to exchange...just return and reorder...so someone isn't getting a gift.Lesson of the day...Stella is great! Ordering through anyone other than Amazon on here - not so much!!"
3,"Cute doll, pants constantly falling down","My daughter loves the magnetic pacifier on this doll, but the doll's pants won't stay up. It's body is huge and then its legs are tiny floppy little things, so the pants won't stay around the waist. It will probably be given away soon. If they improve the pants situation it would probably be our favorite doll."
1,Stella doll,The pacifier has a magnet in it that I was afraid could be chewed off and swallowed by samll granddaughter or pet. Didn't feel it was a safe toy. I would not recommend this doll.
3,Not the best for for 17-month-old,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas - she was 17 months old when she received this gift and was highly disinterested (much, much more interested in her less-plush, ""talking"" dolly). I suspect this would have been a nice item for her at maybe 8-10 months - but was a bit 'young' for her when we presented it. We ended up packing it away. Also, the magnetic pacifier was situated to the side a bit, so has an unnatural/awkward placement on the doll's face - looks strange."
3,Much Darker than it looks,I ordered this for a friends baby whose name is Stella. Online it looks like the doll has a tan but when it arrived it was much much darker. Otherwise a very cute doll...and little Stella loves it
3,Poor return service.,"Just got this item in the mail. And it is really light. If you are causacian this will be perfect for you. I have to return it to get the beige one and it's so much freaking work to do so. Like I have to return it then reorder it, so much freaking work, no exchanges. This is turning me off from buying over this item and it's so small I thought it would have been all longer. In length. I'm disappointed. after reading this review some ppl said the doll was to dark so I thought this one will be perfect so I bought it, now mines is to light. Smh"
1,This is a total waste of 27.00 + shipping!!,"After reveiwing the top requested toys for ages 3 girls on amazon.com, I decided to oreder this Stella doll. What a waste of time, effort, and money. This was very much a disappointment! Could have gone to Walmart and spent 5.00 and would have gotten more for my money!! Sad, very sad!!"
4,It's a gift,This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I haven't given it to her yet but I bought it because I like it so far. I am pretty sure she will love it. She is 17 months old.
4,Stella Doll,My one year old loves this doll. It is very soft and cuddly and she loves taking the pacifier on and off. Out of all the dolls she has received this is by far her favorite.
3,Baby Stella,"Doll was in good condition. However, the box was damaged. Front of box covered in tissue because cellophane was gone."
3,my 2.5 daughter doesnt play with it,"i expected this to be a big hit this christmas, as it would be her first baby doll. but no. :("
3,Cute Doll but has some Dressing Problems,"My daughter loves this doll. I think it is so cute how the pacifier comes on and off. The only problem is the diaper always slides down, which can be very annoying. Overall though, my daughter still loves it."
5,"Sooo...cute! so, soft",Very well made. Super cuddly! I bought this for my new grand daughter & we are all very pleased. Very happy with this pick for my grand daughter's first doll.
3,Cute doll but my girls aren't very interested in theirs,"I bought two of these dolls for my girls earlier this year. My daughters are now 21 months and almost 3. Neither is very interested in these dolls. My 21 month old will kiss hers and then throw it somewhere but she doesn't really play with it. My older daughter isn't interested in hers at all. The magnetic pacifiers are SO cute. I just wish they didn't have a tag on the side of them. I cut it off but now there is a sharp part of tag right along the seams. One of our dolls clothes does not fit either doll, they won't stay buttoned up. I think this doll would be better for younger children such as 5 months-15 months. I still recommend this doll, it is well made, just not my daughters preference."
4,Cute doll,I ordered this doll for my Granddaughter's 1st birthday. She loves it. It is very soft and cute. I thought the price was a little high but other than that I am very happy with my purchase
5,A doll for baby to big girl,"We love this doll! I have always been a doll lover, cabbage patch mostly, but this doll is soo sweet. I have one little girl and 4 little boys. Even the boys play with Stella! She is so soft and cute. She was an instant favorite of my daughters with her magnetic binky. She is made well and easy to wash. A friend recomended her to me and we LOVE HER!"
4,Great little doll for African American girls,I bought Stella for my daughter last year for Christmas when she was one. She loves her so much that she sleeps with her every night. so precious! now we are adding to the collection with accesories this year. Great doll and one that she can identify with :)
5,Great Baby!!!!,I purchased the Stella Doll for my 10 month old grandbaby for her first Christmas. She loves the Stella Doll!!! She plays with the magnetic pacificer all the time and loves to put it on Stella and take it off!!! She also loves her little sprouts of hair. The perfect baby for a baby...very soft and cuddly. This is the first of many Manhattan Babies that I intend on purchasing...It arrived in perfect condition I was very pleased.
5,Plush and cuddly!,"My one-year-old daughter got this doll for Christmas. It's soft and cuddly, and great quality for the price. She loves the magnetic pacifier; she pulls it off the doll's mouth and then laughs when she's able to get it to ""stick"" back on."
5,Love Baby Stella!,"We bought Baby Stella for Baby Lily, and she hugged her and fell in love with this soft cuddly doll instantly! Both look alike with their bald heads and brown eyes and pacifiers! Lily is 15 months, and this doll is perfect for her! So soft and cute in person!"
1,The Hell is in the viewing...,"What this movie is: dark, moody, claustrophobic, and decently made monsters. I didn't say that the moodiness was a good quality, by the way.What the movie isn't: particularly scary, particularly erotic, particularly well-written, particularly well-shot (unless you like sludgy industrial music coupled with Nine Inch Nails style filming), and particularly watchable.At almost 50 minutes into the film, you will be banging your head with frustration at trying to make sense of where the storyline is heading. Yes, the ending sort of ties things up and you sort of understand, but is it really worth the cost of 1:24 minutes of your soul? And, there's nothing ""necro"" about this film. Hagan, one of the characters you see early on, is neither a necromancer nor a necrophiliac--in fact, I wasn't really sure what he was doing with his dead girlfriend and all those tools....Utterly incomprehensible and utterly stupid."
1,This movie is Beyond human comprehension.,"The Best Monster of 2010 in one of the worst movies of 2010.This movie really ticked me off with it's poor sets and total lack of plot.I am happy I made it all the way through this hunk of junk just so I can point out all the flaws. Some of the practical effects are OUTSTANDING while others must have been done by the janitors on the set. It is a tie for what is worse the the horrid acting or shoddy story. I love the voice of the pig headed fat man as he sounds like a cartoon from the 40's and is pretty out of place. One of the dark places of hell is a hall way in the basement of a water plant, I have always wanted to see what hell looks like and now I know it's just a hall way. I believe you should just fast forward to the monsters and skip the rest if you even want to bother with this film at all."
1,Bad Boy,"Poor quality and could not be view for more than 5 minutes cause picture would freeze, over all this dvd it looks like a good evil movie, but it would not play correctly to view it cause it was a piece of junk. At least got my money back."
5,A Lost Gem,"I purchased this CD as I heard Skylark on a Jazziz Sampler at a used store for a couple of bucks.Be advsied that this is one of the finest collection of select movie tunes every on one disc.It swings, is sentemental and Randy Waldman's piano playing is incredible and tasty.The late great John Guerin is on the drums and Chuck Domanico/Bass is excellent as well.What a band and symphony!Pick it up and pay the true freight.Favorite cuts: 3) She Funny, 6) Lovely Way, 7)Alfie, 8)Just the WayBOBrherren101@aol.com"
5,Nice to help your wallet and your gas tank,"This little device with the case is a convenient way to keep your tires properly inflated. Tire pressure is important to getting good gas mileage, but is not the only factor. This digital tire gauge appears to be very accurate and repeatable(not so with the gauge at the delivery station). It is small enough to fit in your glove box or the center console.I've had this gauge for 2.5 years and it has really helped keep my tires at the correct pressure."
1,my husband doesn't like it,"I can't really say what's 'wrong' with it, but my husband said it's junk. I thought it looked nice. Oh well. Guess I wasted more money. Hope it works out better for others."
4,Deficiency of INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE,"Actually, I am UNable to rate this item BECAUSE I was unable to make it work properly, BECAUSE its accompanying INSTRUCTION sheet failed to tell me to FIRST remove the protective label covering the display window, in order to be able to see the tire pressure being registered on that display window:---> That simple situation set off e-mails to the supplier (unanswered); a rating e-mail to Amazon resulting in an extremely fast response from the supplier; a speedy phone call from the supplier; return of the item to the supplier; and a very quick and satisfactory refund by the supplier. All of this could have been prevented had the INSTRUCTIONS alerted me to the presence of the virtually undetectable protective overlay covering the display---which masked what the gauge was actually doing. In all fairness, I must assume the gauge was actually working the whole time. All of this was eventually reported by me to the supplier."
2,Flimsy seal and cheaply made,"Yes, it does work if you get a good seal. I still use it for lack of buying anything better yet. It is poorly made and the tip only formed an easy seal the first month. Since then you have to wiggle and manipulate it to get a reading. That is no fun when you're trying to hold the air hose in 1 hand. Would not buy again."
1,Terrible,"Don't buy this! After trying to use it on three seperate occasions, was able to get it to have some kind of legible reading off one tire, once. There are no instructions on how to calibrate it, or if it needs to be applied to the tire stem with some kind of special maneuver, etc. Tossed it and bought an ""old fashioned"" pneumatic guage that is very reliable and accurate. Don't know why I thought this would be better in the first place."
1,"Accutire MS 4000 Don't buy it, just throw your money in the trash, it will save you a step.","I purchased this as i wanted an accurate tire pressure gauge. The gauge itself is well designed and is great. The problem is that it will not seal to the tire. You ALWAYS loose air when trying to use it. Did these guys not even try this thing before they started sticking customers with it??? Save your money or look at the dump, you may just come across mine. That's where it's headed."
1,"junk gauge, save your money","Bought from the TireRack a few years ago. This gauge was ok at first limited angles due to design, sealed ok. But the rubber end didn't last end resulting in this thing being pretty much unusable. Look elsewhere."
1,Attractive - Yes; High Quality - No,"Long on looks but short on durability and quality of material. With use, it becomes more and more difficult to get a good seal between the guage and your valve stem because: (1) the outer rubber sleeve on the tip of the guage tends to slide when you press the guage against the valve stem of your tires; and (2) the actual piece of the guage that makes contact with the center of your valve stem is made of plastic, not metal, and it wears out rather quickly. The result is that my guage does not even work due to worn parts after only one year of moderate use. Although now useless, the guage looks so nice I still have not thrown it away. Maybe I will use it as a paperweight!"
1,Short Lifespan,"While the gauge itself is accurate, the center plastic tip wears out after about a year of use rendering the unit inoperable. Should have used a metal tip. Sorry I spent the money."
1,"LOOKS great, works poorly: display on mantle?","This miracle of modern science works great the first 10 or 20 or 30 times.Then you realize that readings are becoming increasingly inaccurate (and hard to obtain -- pfffffft!), and it's obvious that the $0.03 seal at the tip is failing. Where do you get a replacement? Ha, gotcha!All show, no go at this point."
3,Digital Tire Gauge,"Some time, if you are in a hurry, it is dificult to attach to the tire gauge, and the ruber part it's move..."
1,Accutire MS-4000B,Was not impressed with this item. recieved it new in package and decided to test it againts a mechanical tire gauge. Air pressures varied or couldnt get a reading. Somtimes showed lower or higher than I expected. Is a piece of junk since it seemed to work better after having to buy new batteries. I should get a refund on this
2,I dont recommend,"This product definitely comes for a low price, but then its too flimsy.I tried opening the stuff and it came off and I was not able to fix it."
3,Not as reliable as one would expect,"I purchased this because, being digital, it should be easy to read. As far as that goes, it really is easy to read. Unfortunately, it has a few problems.1) I find it difficult to get a good seal with the valve stem.2) It seems to read on the 1/2lb. That's just annoying.3) The top is plastic with a rubber covering. The rubber covering is not securely attached to the underlying plastic. If it is used (as is natural) to press the head against the valve stem, it tends to slide up. This interferes with getting a firm connection with the valve stem (it also tends to fray the rubber around the head).4) The battery gives out without warning. I took a reading from two different tires then it failed to read on the third. No warning, just stopped.I'm going back to an analog gauge."
2,Don't be fooled,"Looks cool, a huge pain to use it takes me four to eight tries to get a good reading. I would pass on this."
2,batteries do not last,"I had the gauge for 4 years. it worked ok.The batteries are suppose to be lifetime, but died after 3 years. Then I replaced them and they died after a year.The best thing about this product is the case."
2,Leaky gauge,The air pressure gauge is hard to seal when pushed onto the valve stem. It is hard to get a accurate reading with the leak.
4,nice tire gauge,"This is good tire gauge. We've had it about a month and so far it works fine -- seals properlly and gives consistent, accurate digital readings that are easy to read. It comes in a hard case for protection, too, which is nice."
1,Battery wore out in 2 months; extremely hard to use gauge,"Two months in and the battery for the back light display is dead!! Hard to believe it only lasted that long ... I could just change the battery, but why? The gauge itself is incredibly hard to get on the stem without hearing the hiss of air escaping your tires. Every now and then, I could get a perfect lock the first time, but it's rare and hard to do. I don't know about the accuracy ... I have a pen style gauge that always show 2 pounds more pressure per tire than this digital model.I have an Evo VIII, and tire pressures greatly influence the handling of the car, so I wanted a top quality gauge. Unfortunately I got one that looks really nice, but is too hard to use and wore out too fast."
3,"Decent Gauge, accurate and good for the typical car owner","I drive one of my cars in competition so knowing my tire pressures is important - especially if you want to win a trophy. I received one of these as a gift and the first thing I did was test it against my competition gauge. It was very close - nearly dead on - and easier to read. As noted by another reviewer, getting a good seal between stem and gauge is critical to dependable readings. Mine seems to do a good job making and keeping a tight connection. The case is cool - does a good job of protecting the gauge.This item is definitely easier to use than a stick type gauges and about as good as a decent dial gauge. I probably would not have bought this on my own, but it is a decent product."
4,"Slick looking, but..","harder to use than a traditional tire gauge. I've had trouble making tight seals with its built in rubber nozzle gasket, and overall therefore readings have varied. I'd just as soon buy a regular gauge next time, though this one does indeed *look* slick."
3,"needs reading ""hold"" feature","Good guage but not a serious tool. I verified its accuracy. It is really nice for low light conditions. BUT..... the reading only holds for 10 seconds. Unless you have a good memory you will need a note pad to record readings. No bleed valve, no protuberance to assist in bleed-off"
5,Excellent!! Sharp!!,"I bought this product after a long time of using its other model (LCD display). I was happy with the other one, but hey, what if I have to read my tire pressure in the night with no light? So, this is the BEST solution to this, RED Backlit so you can read it in the night or when it's pretty dark!!It also comes with a very elegant case, looks like glasses case!Remember, measure your tire pressure with cold tires, if you have just parked your car after a trip over 20 minutes, the tires will be filled with hot air, so the pressure will be more than normal (maybe 1-4 pounds, depends)."
1,Obtaining Seal is Very Hard,"I find it a struggle to get a good seal for proper measurement. My old fashioned mechanical gauge is much easier.I regret my purchase, it was a complete waste of money."
2,difficult to get an accurate/clear reading,I had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. I bought this one thinking it would be better. The first time I used it I couldn't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings. It also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading. It would disappear before i could read it fully.
2,Not That Great,"Looks very neat but difficult to use. Getting a good seal is hit and miss. What should be a simple procedure takes too long and frequently ends in loss of air in the tires. When you do get a seal, it works quite well."
2,not worth it,"It only made a good seal for the first week. Now it is impossible to get an accurate reading because rubber gasket fell right out! Case and nice finish are definitely advantages, but they don't outweigh the fact that the gauge broke within 10 days of buying it. A $15 analog tire gauge looks just as cool, and is much more accurate."
2,assume it is disposable,"I have had the gauge for about 3 years. Worked fine for that period. The ""lifetime"" lithium battery has died, and nobody at the company is returning my emails or calls about how to get it replaced. Very annoying. So divide the purchase price by 3 to get annual cost. Then throw it away."
3,Noise anyone?,"Great idea to have these rare records all in a two cd set but the original source for most of the songs unfortunately was not the best, there is a consistent surface noise and more thru all the songs, still there are some great arrangements and Savannah's lovely voice."
2,savannah churchill,"Not a very good quality recording.I loved this artist as far back as when I was a teenager, but I did not enjoy this product at all."
5,Healthy lunch play food set,"This set is great because it enhances my daughter's understanding of what eating healthy means. I have all 3 sets: breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and they are all of excellent quality and will last a long time."
2,Stinky Plastic!!,"My son absolutely LOVES playing with this toy, however, I can't stand it since the plastic smell is very strong. I've tried leaving it outside overnight a few times, but it still smells. Too bad I'm going to have to find a replacement for this toy, since I can't stand the smell. At least we can keep the shopping basket. . ."
5,Fantastic Food Set!,The food is very realistic looking and my kids enjoy playing with it all! My children (age 2 and age 1) will have a lot of fun pretending with this food set :o)
5,Amazing Quality!,I have purchased many of the Learning Resources Food Baskets. They are all AWESOME! They look realistic and are high quality. Best play food that you can buy!
5,Fantastic play food,"I guess you could say I'm a play food fanatic. I've always loved play food! So when we got our daughter a play kitchen for Christmas last year, I didn't want to get junky looking food. After much searching, we settled on Learning Resources. It's fantastic! Very realistic looking. I love that they offer the ""healthy"" options. Gives us the opportunity to pretend play with food we actually eat- and encourages conversations about healthy eating. We have been playing with this food on an almost daily basis for a whole year, and we still love it."
3,Good and bad,"Extensive research, good case studies, knowledgeble discussion of legal issues are strengths of this book. However, there are numerous weaknesses:1 Linking enlightened management directly to ineffective appraisal systems. They are not nedessarily related.2 Not acknowledging managers insight on employees performance.3 Assuming apprasials are generally a high corporate priority compared with other management activities.4 Not recommending one or two focused appraisal functions as an alternative to no appraisals.5 Not providing an explaination of how to administer most pay raise systems (Hay for example).6 Not clearly identifying how the rating drives pay, promotion and bonus. An alternative is required.7 Not disussing how requirements may vary by industry job specifics or the impact of enviromental factors, such as, confidentiality and raises based on senioity. jrj"
5,A convincing view,"I teach Project Management and HR in Stuttgart/Germany. Even under different circumstances we see the problems also: Many performance appraisals destroy teamwork, foster mediocrity and provide a n unwanted short-term focus. I saw all the negative effects in my college as well as my wife`s workplace. A book really worth reading not only in the USA!"
4,This is the future of journalism,"I knew within 10 minutes of opening this book I would adopt it for my multi-media/convergence course. It is a carefully crafted book written with grace. The new world of media is moving at break-neck speed and this is a book that helps all of us envision what the future can and will be. Although a complex and even controversial topic, Quinn and Filak explain, define and provide a great jumping off point for their readers into the world of convergence. The chapters are written by authors of power, credibility and good common sense. Best of all, my students like -- that's right like -- the book.Ralph Braseth is director of the fully converged student media center at the University of Mississippi and is assistant professor of journalism"
2,Not for the amateur (or even experienced) cook,"This cookbook does not give the reader/cook a chance to learn the basic techniques and tastes of the cuisine, but concentrates on particular recipes with lists of ingredients so esoteric that even when I was living in the eastern Mediterranean I was unable to prepare them. And because this is such a recipe-particular rather than general taste-and-technique cookbook, it is difficult to be flexible with the recipes in terms of substitution. This is a cookbook for the purist and not for the practical cook."
4,"A good book, but not a great one","I have made many of the recipes from this book and have enjoyed the results of my efforts. Ms. Wolfert is a recognized expert on the cooking of the region, and as such could have used her status to impart her experiences with the culture as well as the food. One book which does this beyond compare is the book by Sonia Uvezian: A culinary journey through Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan which is now unfortunately unavailable. Kudos to Ms. Wolfert for including sources for hard-to-find ingredients at the end of the book."
2,Interesting but not very useful,"An interesting cookbook if you want to learn about the area. But after leafing through it a couple of times, I can't find anything that looks worth cooking : It's focus is on authentic, local cusine rather than recipes that an American cook could make with readily available ingredients. Grab theWilliams-Sonoma Essentials of Mediterranean Cooking: Authentic recipes from Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, The Middle East, North Africaif you want inspiration and a great collection of useful recipes."
4,"Useful, but be careful.","The forms needed a lot of tweaking, there were parts that referred incorrectly to other parts. And it is heavily client-centric, I think the book was written much more for the person looking to hire a developer than for the developer."
1,"Probably a good book ,..if you could get it delivered","I ordered this for a class only to find out on the estimated delivery day that it is not available from any sources. This happened at 2 separate and different sellers, one being amazon and the other being a college bookstore. Apparantly it is a difficult book to obtain. If you need this book for a class I highly recommend you buy it from one of the used book resellers and not amazon.com as a new book or anyone else who sells it new and gives a future shipment date. Be sure that it is actually 'in stock' before you order it and check that it is the correct edition."
4,Comfortable,"My husband loves these he says they are very comfortable feel like slippers, but they are a little tight to get on, the way the slip cord is around the shoe as a tie. They have held up fine for him he has had a year now doesn't wear them daily though."
5,The filters worked like a charm.,"I had been using a metal screen, but when it wore out I scrambled to find a replacement. When I discovered the paper filters online I was relieved and happy. They work great and are much easier for cleanup after juicing."
5,Must have for Centrifugal Juicers,I've been using these for over nine years about 5x week. Makes cleaning easy and wouldn't even consider trying to run one without it. The filter basket needs to stay clean and not blocked which is what would happen without a filter. Well worth the investment.
5,Omega Filters,"I looked years for these filters, I had given up finding them. I now use my juicer every day again, boy do I feelbetter. I be back for more."
1,1000 Filter Pack contains 200 filters,"Unless you click through the initial page, you may get the impression that the Omega 1000 Filter Pack refers to 1000 filters. But alas, the 1000 refers to a model number not the quantity. You actually get a package of 200 filters."
3,Description,"He'd shown her love; fate snatched it awayNathan. Wind, waves and white water had washed him into Kristin's life one night after the Pacific had done its best to drown him. But the chaotic elements hadn't taken Nathan's life--only his memory.That he had no past didn't matter at all to Kristi for she came to love passionately the man he was right then, Desperately she tried to forget his world outside.Then her hopes for their future were shattered with one slip of the tongue. Nathan had called her Carla!"
4,"A band is A BAND, and The Jam is no exception...","The Jam has turned out to be a major influence on me. Rather than hear about the wunderkund who still sells-out halls and makes great music at his leisure, I felt more curious about the rest of the band, who were basically discarded.The book has great anecdotes about the early days, touring, working hard, and coping with the sudden end of the band. There is no bitterness, which was good. There are also great photos (with not so great captions), and some stuff about Paul that I don't believe even Paolo Hewitt knows. I highly recommend this read for any fan of the Jam, and anyone who thinks they know what it's like to be in a successful band...Think again! If they would've made it here in the US, we would all be listening to much better music now...trust me."
3,"Interesting to get the ""other"" side of the story","""The Jam - A Beat Concerto"" is the authorized bio of the band and a great book in its own right. However, author Paolo Hewitt was (and is) a close confidante of Paul Weller and one always wondered if Messrs Buckler and Foxton were being given completely fair and/or truthful treatment, especially the parts concerning Foxton's actions during the final days.The other 2/3 of the Jam have resolved this problem by issuing this memoir, a mostly terse and factual book. As Weller wrote most tunes and was the political lightining rod, Buckler/Foxton stick to tales of tours, practical jokes, etc. They do address the power struggle that evolved with John Weller, their manager (and Paul's father)."
1,Wrong book sent by the seller,"New Perspectives on Computer Concepts Fourth Edition -- Comprehensive, thats what I ordered. What I received is the New Perspectives on Computer Concepts Fourth Edition -- Brief. This edition is missing half the chapters. Now I am in the middle of a 4 week course, which I can't finish, because razorbackbook sent me the wrong version."
3,New / Used,"My fault - should have made sure the seller said NEW. Got a tape that was open. No sealed wrap and no insert. Anyway, it worked when I needed it."
5,A Great Textbook--Thumbs up!,"After reading this book, and studying the various applications used in the study of statistical analysis of quality control; it has facilitated my understanding of the subject beyond my horizon. I highly recommend this textbook for students as well as those who value the importance in the management of quality control."
2,Could Have Been Better,I have to agree with the other reviewers about this best of. Quite a lot of songs that represent Little Feat are not included. 'Rock And Roll Doctor' is not here along with a few more songs that help define their sound and music. A 2-disc 'Essential Series' edition would be better highlighting tunes from each disc up to and including cuts from 'Ain't Had Enough Fun' to 'Kickin' At The Barn.' If anything this CD leaves the listener wanting more.
1,"The True ""Best Feat"" AlbumW","Why is it that everybody seems to forget ""Dixie Chicken""? Track for track, this is the penultimate Little Feat album, the only criterion being that you can start out with Track 1(Dixie Chicken), and let it go to the end with every song being memorable. Forget the compilations and buy the individual titles from the eponymous first realease through ""Time Loves A Hero"", and if you need a compilation, ""Waiting For Columbus""."
4,Challenging,"If I reviewed this disc the day after buying it, I would have given it a single star. You won't ""get"" these guys immediately. When I was 15 I heard Thelonius Monk the first time, it made utterly no sense. Even the great John Coltrane struggled with Monk's bizzare time signatures and difficult chord phrasings. Dillinger Escape Plan (along with Meshugga) are the heavy metal equivalent of Thelonius Monk (not quite as ludicrously complex, but equally challenging for the listener). If you prefer music to be background noise as you work or something you can sing along to...stay very far away from this CD. But if you enjoy being challenged by the music you listen to, and want tyo be able to discover something new about a song, even after hundreds of listens, get it."
3,A MUST OWN ALBUM,There's not much to say about this that hasn't already been said. This is a must own album. The music on this disc is completely dizzying. Only multiple listens will let you grasp the beats that they play. For people who like music for the music. It doesn't get much more original than this.
4,Inventive Intensity,"Warning - this album is not for the faint of heart. It is pure sonic madness. Intense organized chaos in short brutal spurts. The thing that really set these guys apart are the incredible chops they have. In a couple of minutes the listener travels through jazz, avant garde, noise, hardcore and prog rock. This is not an album of singles and nothing is radio friendly. It is simply a jaw dropping hell of a listen. My faves are ""Sugar coared sour"" (more like pcp-coated insanity) and ""Weekend Sex Change"" You will either love it or positively hate it, there is simply no in between"
5,noise? please...,"BOO HOO dillinger are teh untalented peoples! they make teh ugly solos at the same time! OH YEAH I KNOW TO PLAY TEH ARPEGGIOS ME MAKE POOPIE TEH DILLINGER PLAN GUYS! NOISE! RUN FOR YER LIVES!the arguments above, don't work, they don't stand for anything, they are invalid, they are nonsensical, this release is amazing and there is nothing else to it, and the people who hate it and claim it to be a record by ""untalented people"" is because they are so close-minded that they can't take some screams along with their daily dose of music, so they throw it away and never take the time to listen to it patientlywant some real noise? google the term ""masonna"""
5,All i can say is Dillenger is HERE,This band pack so much guitar mayhem into short two or three minute tunes so if you like all that poser metal/mallmetal ... like slipknot and mudvayne why dont you wake the heck up and calculate infinity with dillenger. Some record reveiwers have catagorized them as calculas metal
3,Not typical,"The album is pretty good as a whole. However, I feel it could have been produced a little better. Some of the album lacks clarity and sounds 'mashed' together. Although, a lot of people like that style. The musicians are not bad, but not supreme either. All in all, its got some suprises in it and is definately not predictable."
5,Beautiful,"I love the violins that are frequently used throughout the course of this album. Of course, by the time Sufjan Stevens reaches Massachusetts, he'll probably be making rap music. Stay strong, man!"
1,A whole lot of noise.,If you think a train wreck would make good music you would probably enjoy this album.
5,Guy Before Me is an IDIOT,"wow....dan or whatever his name was is a total moron. Norma Jean better than DEP? uh.....no. Sorry, buddy. Norma Jean wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for Dillinger. This album came out in 1999 and still smokes pretty much everything out there. Norma Jean is like 5 high school kids who want to be like Dillinger but have a fraction of the talent. The Dillinger Escape Plan's next release is bound to leave everybody in the dust again, and have everybody playing catch up for years to come all over again."
1,Total crap,"I'm tired of ""music"" being released by people who have neither talent nor a shred of a clue as to what they're doing -- And by ""they,"" I mean everyone else in the band! It sounds like everyone in the band is soloing at once.People, this album isn't ""impressive."" It's noise, plain and simple. If you want to hear some REALLY impressive music by musicians that actually know what they're doing, check out Norma Jean's ""Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child"" and Zao's ""Legendary."""
2,Musical Masturbation of the Highest Order,"These guys know their instruments. They are quite technical. Problem is, they have nothing to say. Music without direction, no concept to their songs, chaos for the sake of being chaotic. What else is the point of music if not for expressing something relevant to say? This is the equivalent of a 6 year old baby crying for his mommy.I applaud these guys for their sheer energy, but you can satisfy your fix for engery with much better bands with actual concepts and things to say with the likes of Gorguts and their ""Obscura"" album, along with Spiral Architects ""A Sceptics Universe"". Both bands which are more technical and actually have something to say."
1,The Secret Meaning of the Title,"I have figured out the secret meaning of this CD. ""Calculating Infinity"" is a metaphor for how long it seemed to take before this CD ended. I've listened to Metal/Punk/Thrash/Death Metal for twenty plus years and this qualified as noise even by my standards. Believe me, the bar is set real low on what I consider musical, and DEP just couldn't get one foot up and over..."
4,"Often misunderstood, but a great album","A lot of people are writing and saying that this CD is just noise and not heavy. I guess this could sound like that to a person who's CD collection includes Metallica, Linkin Park, Slipknot, Korn, and other popular hard bands. However, just because a group does not conform to a cookie cutter metal sound does not mean that they aren't metal. I am not going to compare this to another band, because you cannot really do that in this case. There are so many different aspects to every song that it takes multiple listens to grasp this one. I guess the typical metal fan is too lazy for that. If you actually listen to this CD, you will hear some of the most unique, off the wall sound in music today. If you are in the mood for something completely different than what you typically listen to, give this one a try."
5,amazing,It is so nice just to pick these up and look out at the great outdoors with out having to take the time to focus. Bushnell Perma Focus 12x50 wide angle Binocular
2,Not good if you wear glasses,"My cheap 10X50 Rugged Exposure brand binoculars give me a better view. The rubber eye cups did not stay folded back for use with my glasses and I couldn't get my glasses close enough to eleviate the round ""binocular effect"". I did a side-by-side comparison with my cheap binocs and liked the cheap ones better - my vision is not that bad either. Maybe with perfect vision they would work for, but I doubt it."
4,Good Binocs,"These binocular have a great telescopic feel. The perma-focus lenses are great at distance not at anything close-they do not have any focusing capability so do not look at anything below 500 feet. For sports, birdwatching, astronomy their fantastic!"
2,made my eyes tired very quickly,"Just received this product and was very disappointed. Thought I was getting a good bang for the buck. Hazy optics, made my eyes tired very quickly trying to focus. Would spend a few more dollars and upgrade to the Nikon's"
1,permafocus,I was disappointed. The binoculars gave a jpermanent focus but only for objects further than 100 feet. I had used this product before and the focus was permanent for both far and near.
2,Disappointed,"Reading the reviews for this book I thought it would be a more substantial book than what I found. It is a cute idea, but it is lacking in content. Very disappointed...will probably end up as a garage sale book."
5,Handy tool,I've used this scale for fishing and for picking berries. Very handy tool to own at a low price. I can now tell my friends exactly how big my fish are without over estimating and I can tell how many pounds of berries I've picked before bringing it to the checkout.
5,"Accurate, Repeatable, Usable","I am a fisherman, but I bought this scale to use mostly for weighing packages. I'm an avid eBayer and this scale works great. It is very accurate and repeatable. It serves my purposes perfectly and I've been using it for about 5 months now. For the price, you just can't beat it. Similar range shipping scales cost at least 3 or 4 times as much."
3,Average Product,I did not like the lesses too much because every time I zoom in it makes look fuzzy almost as if I had put a soft filter on the camera.
4,A POET'S SHORT STORIES,"Most readers are more familiar with Rita Dove, the poet. Suprise! Rita Dove has also done short stories and eight of them are collected in this wonderful volume called Fifth Sunday. It is the first collection of short stories by this reknowned poet.Fifth Sunday opens the door in the life of African-Americans dealing with life in varied settings. Come to church with Valerie as she daydreams about love and ends up in embarassing circumstances. Check out a gang ""leader"" from the 60's as he gets married and unexpected guests arrive. Share the Spray Paint King's boredom with the psychologist trying to find out why he does this art.Dove's characters are complex, down to earth and won't hesitate to speak their minds. From the mid-west to Germany journey with these multi-dimensional characters who will surprise you.I found this book to be a refreshing look at a poet working in another genre. Rita Dove does a superb job and by all means treat yourself to this marvelous work."
5,Excellent Resource,"I am about half way done with it, but so far this book has taught me a few insights that have directly scored me sales where I would not have. I have worked in sales for the last 7 years, and even the most experienced sales people I know can benefit from this book. It is amazing, I know and understand many of the concepts that Tracy talks about in the book, however he gives some extremely valuable insights that shed some vibrant rays of light on the concepts that most sales people are familiar with to help the reader very easily increase their sales volume. I couldn't be happier with this book."
4,Psychology of Selling by Brian Tracey,"The author explains how to sell to people. The focus is to visualize the end results and set realistic goals. The importance of face-to-face contacts is enunciated in order to get peopleinvolved in the transaction to refine needs and close the sale.The author emphasizes the need to demonstrate the product so thatthe customer can evaluate it. This book would be valuable to anyperson embarking on a career or position in selling. There are practical examples, as well as a firm approach to get startedwithout the ""analysis paralysis syndrome"" ."
3,Try the Audio Book Instead,"I read this as a part of a book club style reading with some of my employees. I kept feeling, over and over again, that BT was full of it. I had also heard the audio book a few years before this and I felt that was way better. Maybe it's just that content is geared more towards audio, but the written version just wasn't doing it for me.And there's nothing here you won't get from Ziglar's Secrets, so check that out instead. Use the audio as supplemental when you're in your car."
2,Much better Models To Choose From,"Do yourself a favor and but a real vacuum. I bought this unit for a commercial allergy cleaning business and was very disappointed. It is not built for commercial use and I doubt it will last long for home use. It's is all marketing hype and has no real functionality. I needed a good true HEPA vacuum and this one has the flimsiest of closures that cannot seal the bag compartment at all. In addition, the bags are very had to find (online only) and you can't get the special micro-lined bags for this model. It looks good but everything is cheep thin plastic. The tool door pops open all the time and it has a roller brush but no real beater-bar. Good brand and manufacturer but horrible model. Skip this one and buy one of their other ""tried and true"" models."
1,packing error,"While the cookware I purchased appears to be quite nice, I did not receive the item I ordered. I took a chance on a refurbished piece since it was all that was available. However, in my pre-Christmas haste, I didn't inspect the box before wrapping it. When the gift was opened by the recipient, it turned out that the adhesive product identification tag on the bottom of the box did not match what was actually in the box or the item description on the box itself. I probably should've returned it, but the gift recipient said he'd keep it."
3,I think I just prefer to not have a case at all.,"I believe this case actually stayed on. I got it for my brothers PSPgo but he sold it before even owning it a month. I prefer not to use a case. If you prefer a case, this one should work fine."
1,Can't charge PSPgo with it on,"It's a nice case, but in order for you to charge or connect to USB, you're going to have to remove it. Bad design flaw."
4,religion,"the first part with opinions about religion is veryinteresting, al lovable as his best works, thesecond part about catholicism might beinteresting for those interested in religiousstudies."
3,PLASTIC,"THESE ARE MADE OF PLastic to long and to round, dont fit any 6x9s i have. GET THE FOAM ONES. SORRY I CANT RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT"
5,Amazing.,"This fast-paced album blew me away. If you like bands like Fiya and New Mexican Disaster Squad, you'll probably love the hawks. Just a guitarist and a drummer, they still get a great sound. Amazing CD."
5,from age-ing to sage-ing,This book was very inspiring and thoughtful. It lifts the aging process to a new level and makes it something to celebrate rather than dread.
5,Wise advise,"The two chapters in this book that I appreciated the most were Chapter 8 Mentoring: Seeding the Future with Wisdom where on reads that modern day families all to often turn to some 'professional' when it comes to issues involving our families, and these 'experts' don't even have to have kids or even be close to their own families. Its the sheep skin with some Latin on it that makes them more knowledgeable than our own elders.And Chapter 9 Elders as Healers of Family, Community and Gaia. I ignored the Gaia aspect since its not something I am into. But the rest is pretty on target as far as how the inter generational health benefits are when children and young adults are around older people who have alot to offer, and how what they offer is more patience, a sense of humor and secure grounding that equates to security."
4,Great Book,"This is a great book, but you should go to Mr. Forta's site to see all the corrections that have been made.Otherwise, this book is great like all the rest of his books."
3,Still Not Sure About It,"Still not sure what to make of this movie. But I will say this, after I watched it, it kept creeping back into my thoughts uninvited. So much so that I went back and watched the final two scenes again (the final scene and the scene that's happening as the credits roll). Still didn't know what to make of it. But it has stayed with me and I still think about it. Maybe that's the mark of a great movie. Maybe this should be a five-star movie. Maybe some day I'll figure it out."
1,The skirts run very small,Great service BUTI am a size 16w and got a 1x. It fit like a Large. Exchanged it for the 2x and it fit like a Large as well. I don't know what to tell you except order accordingly or use another vendor for your leather skirts.
1,hard to use,"This telescope is very hard to use. It is hard to keep focused, the compass is just a little magnetic handheld compass, and the locator was impossible to figure out. Granted, we are amateurs, but we aren't ignorant. The printing on the telescope was upside down when we put it together. Several adults looked at this telescope because we were having so many problems getting it to perform, but they too, gave up! We sent it back!"
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this telescope last year as a Christmas present. Granted, both the recipient and I are amateurs, but after four hours of trying, the best we could get was an out of focus view of the moon. I've owned telescopes before, and they worked better than this one. The tripod's legs wouldn't stay extended, so that we eventually had to put it on a table to be able to see out. We never used it long enough to try the computer tracking, so I can't comment on that.After a couple more attempts to get it to work by friends who know more about telescopes than I do, I unloaded it at a yard sale this summer....."
3,Philips Avent Isis Duck Valves - An essential item but fragile,Not a bad product but they are too fragile for my liking and difficult to wash properly without splitting them.
4,Exactly what we needed,"We recently replaced the ""soft"" parts for our 6 year old Avent ISIS duo and these worked perfectly. Plus they were cheaper than the part from Phillips directly.Easy to pop in and out and easy to clean.We don't use soap on these parts, we rinse them real well and sterilize as needed with the Avent microwave steamer.These come with a plastic box that works fairly well for storage but certainly doesn't close very tight if you are tossing it in the pump's bag. No biggie if you put it in a pocket or wrap it with a band but worth mentioning."
3,Not that great.,"I bought this book and a couple of others so that I could learn a few songs. When I played with the CD's the chords on some of the songs just didn't match. It is not that accurate and if you can the songs you want to learn elsewhere, I would suggest that over this book. Some of the songs are pretty accurate, that is why I gave it the three stars."
1,Does not work on Kindle 3 - Keyboard,Way too small to view on the Kindle 3. I bought two songbooks that work pretty good. But this one does not. It only fills about one quarter of the screen and will not enlarge. The music is way too small to view. I think I will stick to regular print for guitar tab in the future.
4,FUN BOOK,"FOR THOSE WHO LIKE OR LOVE DOING WORD JUMBLES THIS IS THE BOOK TO ORDER- IT HAS PLENTY OF FUN PUZZLES. I DO SOME OF THE PUZZLES ALMOST EVERY DAY, IT RELAXES ME. I WOULD DEFINITELY ORDER OTHER JUMBLE PUZZLE BOOKS."
1,FAIL,"BUYER BEWARE!!!Padding insufficient--my new MacBook 17 was dented within weeks of use of this bag!Furthermore, after less than a year of use the stitching started falling apart!"
3,Shipping Warning,"This is a specific comment for Amazon Prime members. This is one of the items, because of it's size and weight, that does not qualify for free 2-day shipping. I point this out because it isn't mentioned here on the product page and, unless you notice it defaults to ""Standard Shipping"" while ordering, you may miss it. Since this price isn't particularly different from what I've seen in brick and mortar office supply stores, if you need your paper in a hurry, this may not be a great option for you."
3,There is better paper out there,I purchased a full case of this paper since there was a nice rebate from the seller. Like to never have received that rebate. The paper is listed as 92 bright and I have another 92 bright I compared a sheet with and there are vast differences. The paper is 20 lb. It is a dull paper that makes your typed pages look dull. The paper was cheaply priced and I guess the old saying that you get what you pay for is true in this case. While copies can be used for intra office memos I have refrained from sending any letter out on this paper as they look dull and flat. It's OK for other than the nice letters you need.
3,Copy paper is copy paper,"Ordered this paper based on price, reviews and free shipping. Received it in a timely fashion and it is as advertised. I have been running it through my Brother Laser printer for about a week with no issues."
2,Buy if you have spare time and gas,"I have to drive 30 minutes to home from work to sign for this box of paper, and the freight company (Pilot) can't even give me a specific time to meet them. Pilot said Amazon won't let me leave a signed letter on my door so that I don't have to be there to sign for my package. I'm a Prime member. For the time spent from work and gas money I will spend to sign for this box of paper, I should have gone to Staples."
3,GROUNDED,"DARK RAGE focuses on Laurel Kring, a disgruntled ground control technician who takes over the airport's flight tower and murders a few people along the way, including his wife, a flight attendant and assorted personnel who get in his way. The novel has some good moments, but it's plodding pace and anticlimactic ending keep it from reaching its true potential."
2,Danger High Voltage... dull song.,"Who said that a mix of voices with strange music tones always worked? In this case Electric sex failed A LOT with this song, a mix of all kind of instruments, the voices are also not matching at all the kind of music they wanted to create. Just trying to hard to make it a disco song, but not achiving it mostly makes it a dull song. The most annoying part of the song is the continue almost scream of the song name in the chorus like a hundred times. It happens that you feel like grabing the cd and smashing it against a wall. its a pity that in such a great cd theres a song like this and a cd named after this bad song."
4,Great deal,"Awesome! just got these in. GREAT!!!!! value. I can't say enough about the quality of these binocs. The look, the feel, the weight, its all great. I don't know how Bushnell put a product this good out on the market for the price. Right on Bushnell! The only reason I did'ent throw 5 stars on this, is that the lens caps kinda stink. But for the price, I think I can deal with it."
2,Boys and foreign language learning.,"It is nice to see women being concerned about the huge gender imbalance in languages education. Unfortunately, they are handicapped by being women and academics. They are handicapped by a theoretical stance which dismisses the biochemistry and physiology of boys, thus the book is full of politically-correct references to the 'social constructs of gender'. Perceptive readers of this book will come away with a much better understanding of why our education system fails most boys and it is not for the explanations given by Carr and Pauwels."
5,An intelligent beginning on the path to finding happiness,"When I was searching for a book of information about online dating, I bought four books from Amazon. Three of these were silly and superficial in their approach. IT TAKES TWO.COM was strikingly different. Not only do the authors have the first-hand experience of meeting online themselves, but also in helping people resolve relationship problems. What I really enjoyed about this book were the many specific examples and directions for how to be successful online, and how to learn more about yourself in the process. Through accounts from people who have lost as well as won online, the authors explain ways to protect yourself as well as avoid hurting others on the way to finding a partner. IT TAKES TWO.COM was a very meaningful book to me personally, and I'm sure it will help many people in their online search."
4,review of Model 192100 (4x4x24x),"A brief review of Micro Solution's Backpack CD-Rewriter (Model 192100). I bought the Backpack in early 2001 and it has been working flawlessly since. Easy to install, it works with either your computer's parallel or USB ports. Software includes Adaptec Easy CD Creator and Direct CD. A great alternative to external drives, the only flaws are its weight and need to be plugged to an outlet. You won't be using the Backpack with your laptop in a car or airplane. However, the Backpack is perfectly suited for transporting between desktop computers. Its speed (4x4x24x) is fast enough for most users (average burning time for an audio CD is 20 minutes). I found the Backpack to be a worthwhile purchase."
3,Interesting Read,"This book kept my interest and the author explained her feelings very well without being overly morose. It seemed cruel, however, when she wouldn't allow her mother in law to see her own son placed into the ground. And when the husband had pre-arranged to send his mother some valentines day flowers(he died soon after), why on earth did the author tell her mother in law that they were from her and her children?"

4,Everything you need to fit your unit in your dash,"This kit will help you install a pioneer unit in your dash. I replaced my single-din unit with this double-din install kit, and it fits well. The only difficulty that I encountered while installing was that I needed to shave the corners of the pieces that fit around my unit to slide into the sleeve piece, since it would not fit otherwise. Other than this small difficulty, everything in the kit will help you install the unit. You'll only need the harness specific to your vehicle in order to have it completely installed and working, as well as any other sub or video cables for other accessories."
4,"Great mount, but be carefull...","I love this mount, so easy to remove your unit(4-screws) for service or to add a subwoofer RCA cable if you later decide to add a subwoofer to your car.But... it wouldn't fit my 2002 Ford Escape opening w/o major cutting/modifing the dash.So I couldn't use it, arrr! Maybe I can sell it on e-Bay?"
1,basic and very expensive for contents,"I rate this as low as I do because the price ishigh, and it is a basic electrical dictionary, not a telecommunications dictionary. Does not have any detail on telephone services."
3,"This is made well, but it's too bulky for me.","Good quality, would hold your piece well, but anyone who looks at your ankle would likely be able to see it."
2,Not the book pictured,"Just a warning - the 1981 publication of this book is a revised edition. It does not include the quaint, old fashioned illustrations a pictured. If you are looking for the adorable, cloth cover, older version of this book, this is not it. If I can find a picture of the 1981 illustrated cover I will link it here. This is what these listings are for."
2,"A decent overview, but errs on at least one specific game.","My specific goal with this book was to find information about the famous Texas domino game of ""42,"" so I was primarily interested in that section of the book. Its attempt to teach that game is inconsistent with the known guidelines and strategies played in Texas 42, so be careful if that is your interest in this book. If so, a comprehensive new book solely on the domino game of ""42"" is available from amazon.com - ""Winning 42: Strategy & Lore of the National Game of Texas."""
4,"Great music, lousy packaging!","I just took delivery of this set. I know the catalogue well so I knew what I was getting. The sound is terrific.Rhino needs to give their heads a shake in box set design. Every single disc has scuff marks. I was very careful to remove the discs and put plastic sleeves in each slot so the discs will slip in and out easily. The scuffing is a result of the discs being housed in hard cardboard sleeves with no protection. Although this has been brought to their attention time and time again, they continue to do this sort of thing ie 'Where the Action Is: the L.A. Nuggets'"
5,"Wisdom, Not Hammer","Here is a quote I came upon today, and since it comes so peculiarly consonant with my perception of this captivating retrospective, I could not resist bringing it here, without any attempt to diminish the validity of any of the subjects.""Wisdom, Not Hammers""A home,"" wrote Solomon the Wise, ""is built with wisdom"".And not with a hammer.Because wisdom is the glue of beauty. Wisdom, meaning the ability to step back and see all of the picture, the past and, most important, the future to which all this leads. To see the truth inside each thing.Without wisdom, there are only fragments. With wisdom, there is a whole. And there is peace between all the parts of that whole."""
3,EXPECTATIONS,I BOUGHT THIS SET FOR MY HUSBAND AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT.HE'S A HUGE FAN.HE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS GOOD HE HAD GREATER EXPECTATIONS.
4,"excellent box, only 1 flaw","it'll take us a while to listen to 9 cds & a dvd too, but i plunged into my favorite Plant lp, ""Manic Nirvana"" & it sounds great. Pretty box & packaging, but the one flaw is it's an open box with cd sleeves. It'll make it hard to keep the dust off the top cds in the box. Only solution i can see is to store the box sideways."
2,Nice box but poor music.,"The only thing worth listening to from Plant since Zeppelin is not included here which is the awesome Page/Plant reunion. The albums presented here are complete garbage, and now with the blue grass, country trash Plant is doing now it's gettign worse....whats next Rappin Robert Plant. Plant do your solo thing as you please but please don't alienate your Zeppelin/Rock followers any longer."
3,Remastered the right way,"Why don't the record companies remaster the CD's the right way when they first come out, instead of years later?It's because so you either buy this box set or wait for the albums to come out next year remastered the right way."
5,nine lives box set,"An amazing collection of songs that shows Plant's versatility. He is one of the few male vocalist who can really sing, as in really sing. His songs in this collection are timeless. Except for the 'sea of love' how come i don't hear them on the FM stations? I am sick & tired of hearing the beatles & whatever."
3,"Decent, but not ""The Deep""","This is a decent treasure hunt action movie. I couldn't help considering how much it reminded me of an older classic diving for treasure movie ""The Deep"". The cast Nick Nolte, Robert Shaw, Jacqueline Bisset, Louis Gossett Jr., and Eli Wallach were excellent. ""The Deep"" story by Peter Benchley was exciting and believable as well. It was about them diving for Spanish treasure and they find morphine on a WWII freighter after a storm. The local drug dealers want it. Hmm sounds similar wouldn't you say? ""The Deep"" used some sharks to make it scary, but the Moray Eel was the real scare factor. Perhaps ""Into the Blue"" was an attempt at a fresh new version. I am afraid it falls a little flat in a few places, but overall I still don't regret seeing it one bit. It does pretty well considering it doesn't have an all star cast like ""The Deep"". There is enough beautiful camera work, decent acting, and reasonable story line to keep your interest."
3,DVD Review,"The DVD was like new, just a few minor flaws which do not affect the movie. THe movie has great footage in the Bahamas, the story is so-so. Plays great in HI-DEF."
3,"not an award winner, but a fun summer flick to watch","this film is not amazing. its not a spectacular adventure about treasure hunting and drug busts. its a summer action flick. its 'the national treasure' but with less clothing and more water. its like watching fire works go off for an hour and a half. its fun to watch and great entertainment, just not something you want to keep in your dvd collection as a classic. fun flick though."
3,Haven't I seen this movie before???,"If I was Peter Benchley's estate, I would have sued. This was basically an updated version of ""The Deep.""""The Deep"" vs. ""Into the Blue""Hot babe(s) - checkSwimming scene with see-thru t-shirt or revealing bikini - checkDiscover possible sunken pirate ship - checkSunken drug ship or plane nearby - checkFriend betrays to local drug dealer - checkSame friend gets executed by local drug dealer - checkClimatic underwater fight - checkSunken drug ship or plane gets blown up - checkBad guy gets chomped by moray eel or shark - checkProof of pirate ship gets found - checkThe only thing missing was cheesy John Barry disco music."
5,Blue waters,"There are really two parts to this film.The first one is a beach and underwater film with the characters portrayed by Paul Walker and Jessica Alba. If you look at the cover of the blu-ray, that picture is worth a thousand words, and that's pretty much the first part of the film. This blu-ray also features Scott Caan, from the current TV series ""Hawaii Five-O"". It's a fairly peaceful life on an island paradise.The second part of the film involves discovery, temptation, guile, violence, guns, danger, betrayal, and death. You also have the introduction of a bunch of crazy, nasty, wicked, vile and murderous characters. Who wants to watch all the gore and pain? Sometimes, you just don't want to see blood everywhere.You can summarize it as a Garden of Eden theme, with knowledge, temptation, and a fall from Grace, sending them from a peaceful paradise into a twisted hell.Needless to say, I prefer the first part. I give five stars for the first part and just ignore the second part."
5,Into The Blue,"This Film is a definite winner, with an outstanding beginning, middle and end. The film is action packed and well acted, as well as produced."
4,"Skin, Scuba diving and sharks","Wait, before you condemn this movie and categorize it as another ""babe watch"" show, take another look at Walker and Alba's underwater skills and the curious grey? reef sharks. I've never swum that close to even the placid white tip. Lifting heavy objects using floatation device and transferring air from balloon mouth-to-mouth when tank is empty requires at least rescue certified skills. I would be happy enough not to disturb the bottom sand for macro look.I think this movie would appeal to most scuba divers or avid snorkellers."
3,BEAUTIFUL BODIES AND BAHAMAS,"The lush Caribbean scenery and the delightful physical attributes of the movie's stars are the highlight of this otherwise routine criminal caper. Paul Walker (TIMELINE, FAST AND FURIOUS) and Jessica Alba (DARK ANGEL, SIN CITY, FANTASTIC FOUR) are surely easy on the eyes, and the underwater photography is sumptuous. Scott Caan and Ashley Scott aren't hard to look at either. The storyline follows these four on a search for sunken treasure and their discovery of a downed airplane full of cocaine, which some nasty bad guys want, of course. James Frain is the head badguy, a Britisher named Reyes, and Josh Brolin looking more and more like Dad James is aboard as a rival treasure seeker. The movie starts out a little slowly, and you're wondering if anything's going to happen, but once it does, it picks up the pace and ends up being derivative but entertaining."
3,"Great Visuals, So-So Movie","In this thriller about drugs and other stuff, the things you see are more important than the story, acting, ect. jessica alba and paul walker run around half naked the whole time and look good. the beach is beautiful as well. everything else is under-done. it has its moments but this movie wont go into the history books as a ground breaking film."
3,"Winners make the rules, losers live by them","This movie is entertaining and enjoyable to watch, can't see that the actors are brilliantly but their not the worst. The two main actor/actress are Jessica Alba and Paul Walker who are a couple living their dreams on the Bahamas, the two of them are treasure hunters hoping to hit big and retire early with their millions. Everything starts to go wrong when an old Friend Scott Caan shows up with his newest girlfriend Ashley Scott, as they go treasure hunting the find a plane that is full of drugs no more said you can see were its going.Treasure, Drugs, Sharks Good Fun"
3,An enjoyable 3.5 star movie.,"I'm not a big Paul Walker fan and I'd have Jessica Biel before Jessica Alba any day but having said that, I found this to be a very enjoyable film and think it was unduly ripped apart by so called professional critics on it's release. To be honest being a massive fan of The Deep with the late great Robert Shaw, Nick Nolte and the stunning (at the time) Jacqueline Bisset I didn't think I'd enjoy this at all as I thought I'd be comparing it all the way through but Into The Blue stands on it's own all be it with a similar plot to The Deep. Also of note is the underwater photography which is beautiful and even more so with Jessica Alba swimming around in it! Ignore the critic's, give it a chance and you'll find an enjoyable piece of escapism for it's 100 minute running time. Definitly one I'll be purchasing."
3,"Relatively cliched, but sort of fun","Jessica Alba cannot act, but she looks good here in her bikini, all sweaty while fighting off any number of muscular evil drug dealers while narrowly avoiding being constantly eaten by sharks. There is little in this action adventure that is remotely credible, as if it is that easy to take a blower into the sea and blow off the sand from a 150 year old wreck full of gold. Whatever. And the annoying lawyer brother of the male lead needs to be slapped throughout. You won't learn anything from this, but the constant underwater photography is stunning."
3,Good story but drags on and will leave viewers board at times,"I enjoyed this film in many ways. First the story is good, Second all the underwater scene's could actually be done by normal people9except holding there breath under water for a very long time). The acting is ok I really enjoy Alba and I think she's the next big thing, paul Walker is alos good in the movie but his acting is not great. The bad stuff about the movie is it dose drag on at times and it drags on and on and on. The under water scens'a are good but some times it's to much under water. the stpry is predictable but it's fun."
5,Good action movie for the whole family! ?Not just because of the female in the move?,"This was a good action movie, that we saw on T.V. We watched the movie as a family and enjoyed all of the action. We enjoyed seeing the sea and sea life. We enjoyed the plot line and the actors, they did a great job! You will enjoy all of the views and all of the action and great actors! It was a great movie because it was a great movie, not just because of the female in the movie, although her acting is good. All of the actors did a great job, not just Alba.We plan to purchase this movie once we find the movie on DVD for a good price. It was great to see the movie on T.V. first so that we will know that it is a good movie before we purchase. Get ready for some twist and turns!"
3,Eye Candy > Story Content?,"The movie was decent. It wasnt bad, it wasn't awesome. More than anything; I did actually enjoy the movie (somewhat). Paul walker did well enough, and Jessica Alba as well. The cinematography and locale is beautiful. What didn't work for me was the chemistry between the two lead's. Sure they look great, but their chemistry just wasnt' there. Throughout the movie, there's not much character development between the two, which is sad, considering they're the main characters. Though pleasing to the eye, they spent a little too much on the eye candy, and not enough on the content. The movie is decent, and watchable, but definitely nothing you'd write home about. I honestly believe the story with this current cast could have been done much better if it were put into the hands of a better director. 3/5 stars from me."
3,Neat Sites and People,"Good actors, good shots and decent script. Paul Walker is good as alaways but better in Fast and Furious 2 than this , but still an entertaining flick. If you like the great water/beach flicks go for this one."
4,more than just Jessica Alba's rear,"We all know that Jessica Alba is hot. And I admit buying this based on the review that the best part was watching her swim in a bikini. But there were only seconds of that, and the movie stands on its own pretty well as the old ""treasure hunt gone bad"" story."
5,Jessica Alba In A Bikini...Need I Say More?,"If you like to be entertained this film is worth renting and if you are a big fan, like I am, of Jessica Alba this film is worth buying. I didn't see this film at the theater, but after renting it, I immeadiately bought it. You can read the other reviews here from the psuedo-critics who pan the film, but the bottom line here is: Was the film entertaining? The answer to that question is yes! The reason why most of us go see a film in the first place is to be entertained, and this film delivers! If you are someone who likes to have fun and likes to be entertained I guarantee you will enjoy this film."
3,Not as bad as last reviewed...,"I have to say that this movie was not as bad as some people put it out to be. Yes, this movie is not Oscar material, but this movie was made for pure entertainment. This movie will not make you think, this is a movie that you can just sit back relax and kick back with a few beers...the storyline was pretty well developed for a movie of this calibur, and the actors did what they could with the material that they were given. Excellent underwater footage...just awesome! So, if you are looking for something to just enjoy, without a lot of thought needed, and you can place your expectations down to a lower level, then I would recommend this film."
3,Jessica Alba in a bikini,"Two slackers looking for treasure buried at sea accidentally find a sunken airplane at the bottom of the sea filled with millions of dollars worth of drugs. Acting was campy, not really an interesting story but Jessica Alba in a bikini makes it worth your time."
5,A genius Thought,"A man Who Thinks and Writes like Gibran Khalil Gibran can not die - his soul is always alive in the world and his home town Bcharre, Lebanon..."
4,gary wilson,"It's amazing how great this holds up almost 3 decades after his 1977 masterpiece. I couldn't imagine a better album of new material. This album is as weird as ever, but also every song is either really hypnotic, or really catchy. The sped-up vocals are particularly strange, but very arty. They remind me of Frank Zappa & the Mothers' stuff on We're Only In It For The Money. Gary Wilson is a unique figure for sure, and he deserves any attention he gets. If you love quirky pop songs and you're open minded for weirdness, buy this."
5,Wow.,"I had to read this for a school assignment and wasn't particularly looking forward to it, but I am so glad I did. This book is amazing. It chronicles the famous Scottsboro trial, from the initial incident all the way through to many years after the trial. The book is written very convincingly in that it tries to present the different perspectives of relevant parties/persons. This made me feel like Goodman wasn't trying to push his own agenda but was instead simply presenting as best he could an accurate historical account of the facts surrounding Scottsboro. The book itself is written like a story, but you can tell from its presentation that the ""story"" was very historically driven and all facts mentioned were well-documented. A fascinating account of Scottsboro. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about it. I'm not sure a better resource exists on this topic."
3,"Ok, but not as convincing as others.","Having already read Dan T. Carter's masterful Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South, I already knew the story of the Scottsboro boys and the miscarriage of justice that happened to them. I hoped to get more insight with this book. Unfortunately, its unclear style got in the way. I would guess that someone who was unaware of this case might love this book--but if you are looking for more than narrative, get Carter's book instead."
5,Very soft and cozy,"This is the second Fido Fleece bed I have purchased for my dog. I have tried other beds, but he would not sleep in them. It is very soft and warm without being too hot for him. He loves it."
2,Fido not so happy with this fleece,"I am very disappointed in this bed - especially since I have it in a smaller version and have loved that one. My puppy grew out of his small Fido bed, but because he loved it and it washed so well, I went out of my way to get what I thought would be the same bed in a larger size. All the stuffing in the cushion shifted to one spot when it was washed. Also, the cushion is smaller that the bed and leaves a gap between cushion and sides of bed. That didn't happen in the smaller version. I'm just disappointed."
4,Pretty Good,"I disagree with the afformentioned notion pertaining to MTV and Story of the Year. True, Story of the Year sucks, as does MTV, but I discovered emo music on my own several years ago and personally I enjoy this CD substantially. If you do think that Story of the Year is good... you suck."
3,"Lute music and German songs ""Musicalische Tafel-Erlustigung""","Performers: Axel Köhler, Lauttern CompagneyIncludes songs by N. Zangius and J. Eccard. Together with instrumental pieces by E. Reusner, W. Brade, and B. Praetorius.Nicolaus Zangius (1570-1610): Auf Dienst will ich ihr singen. Jungfrau ich sag es euch gut deutsch. Adieu meins Herzens Kronlein. Fahr hin all Freud.Johann Eccard (1533 - 1611): Frohlich will ich singen. Unser lieben Huhnerchen."
2,Is this the same author?,"Is this the same author who wrote the literary gem ""Evergreen""? If I wouldn't have seen Belva Plain's name on the cover flap, then I wouldn't have believed that the such an established author could produce such a trite, unimaginative, immature piece. Dare I call it literature. Quality is so much more important than quantity and I would suggest that instead of producing the ""annual-quota"" of fiction, Ms. Plain hibernate with her thoughts so as to present a better storyline. This was truly disappointing."
3,"Pleasurable, but entirely predictable.","Plain was not at her best with this novel. The events are predictable, and the sugary-sweet ending is less than realistic. Plain has many better books to choose from. This one is pure cotton candy. Fans of Plain will read it, but with some disappointment."
2,Predictable mush,"I received this book in a compilation of four works in a book of the month type club. This is the ONLY reason I read this book. I mistook it for a short story initially. I've never read the author before, but this book is amateurish at best. Simplistic, short, disappointing. The concept may have been promising, had everything not turned out happily ever after. Way too many long-term, complex problems solved in a day to even be considered minutely believable."
3,"Good book, but not good enough!","I've read many of Plain's works, but I just found this one to be not well developed. Of course an incident always brings people together. That's just par for the course. This book read like one of Danielle Steels newer ones (The ones that have fallen in quality). You're better off reading another Plain book."
3,Feel-good novel with predictable plot and characters,"This is definitely not one of Belva Plain's best books. Is itwrittenjust to make us feel good - to be in line with the festive season? I find the plot too predictable. I rushed to finish the book, not because it is good, but because I was bored and wanted to go on to another book. I do not object to the reunion of all the characters except for that of Cynthia's and Andrew's. No doubt both were at fault for the separation, but I feel that while how Cynthis behaved was understandable, what Andrew did was unforgivable."
2,Not the Belva Plain I'm Used To!,"There is something this story is missing. Everyone in 85 year old Annette Byrne's family is at war with each other. She wants to gather her family together at home and have them all make peace even knowing the strong bitterness between them. Annette does just that, and they all have a big fight with one another until an incident happens to bring them together while meeting at Annette's home.I don't know-this story lacked something though. I think it was that she didn't develop the characters enough for the plot which was shallow somehow. I see where more could have been developed and elaborated on before the run-in with each other at the meeting took place.Belva Plain usually writes with more depth than this with each one of her characters in the past books I read of hers. This just wasn't really developed quite enough."
2,Is this the same author?,"Is this the same author who wrote the literary gem ""Evergreen""? If I hadn't seen Belva Plain's name on the cover flap, then I wouldn't have believed that such an established author could produce such a trite, unimaginative, immature piece. Dare I call it literature? Quality is so much more important than quantity and I would suggest that instead of producing the ""annual-quota"" of fiction, Ms. Plain hibernate with her thoughts so as to present a better story line. This was truly disappointing."
3,I found this book to be entertaining but not very realistic,"Although this book is very well written, I didn't find it to be very believable. It would be nice if things like this worked out in real life but, as a rule, they generally do not. However, I did enjoy reading this book and I will be reading more books by Belva Plain. We all can use alittle fantasy in our lives to relieve the stress and tentions of the day."
1,"Boring, predictable account of a dysfunctional family","Remembering which characters were which made reading this book a bit tedious. The only characters that were remotely developed where Cynthia and Andrew and the tragedy of losing their twin children. My question after reading about the near drowning of Lucy is why didn't anyone go to the hospital? It was a disappointing fairy tale of a meddling wealthy grandmother, her piggish, stubborn children, and alas from these children we have their equally rediculous offspring."
2,Disappointing,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying this at the book store. After reading the Evergreen saga from Evergreen to Harvest, this book was very disappointing.. It lacked the depth of plot and characters I was expecting after reading the others. The excerpt of Legacy of Silence at the end was better than the whole Homecoming book. Don't waste money on this one. Rent it from the library for a weekend read. I am waiting for my copy of Legacy of Silence to arrive. I'll let you know how it compares."
2,Very simple reading...VERY Predictable,It was a harmless story...very easy reading and very short. Save your money because you won't want to read it again...this is one to read with the library card.
1,"Empty, cliche-ridden froth","This is a story that has already been written many times, mostly by people like Barbara Taylor Bradford. Not only is it totally predictable, right down to the almost-drowning in the icy pond, but the characters are all flimsy, one-dimensional people and, mercifully, completely forgettable. To add insult to injury, the paperback is priced at around six dollars, even though the print is DOUBLE SPACED! What a rip-off. I have not read any of Plain's prior work and certainly won't be buying any of her books in the future."
2,A bit shallow,"My Book Club read this book and we were generally disappointed. Although we liked that it was a good short read, we were not happy with the lack of depth in the story lines. The overall concept was good, but unbelievable in the way it was presented."
3,GIRLS NEED MORE,"Okay, I know there is a place for a book that is filled with girls' worries and sorrows and anguish. But for my money, it's more valuable to give a girl a book that does not just reflect her angst, but that offers solutions, tips, hope, and empowerment. The best book I know about for girls (preteen and teen) is GIRLTALK: All the Stuff Your Sister Never Told You which recently came out in a fourth edition. I read it as a teen back in 1985 and recently gave the fully updated book to my nieces--who loved it."
4,Amazing and intense view of teenage girl life,"When I find out about this book, I brough it inmediatley. It was a litle more intense than what I expected but every word was true. I could relate whith many of this stories, whowever I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone under 14 because of it's sometimes strong content."
4,Why are the girls on the cover so pretty?,"The book provided great insight to this mother of a 7-month old daughter trying to understand and anticipate. Still, I did wonder, when the first chapter is about body image, why the cover displays girls who are clearly the pretty girls at school. Doesn't this lessen the author's and contributors' hope that girls should not be judged by their looks? Also, I would suggest that the topics are slightly skewed from the average teen experience if only because we tend to write more about difficulties than less challenging topics. Still, these difficult topics are important to understand."
3,"Good Stories and poems,but Shandlers commentary is annoying","it was not necessary for Shandler to share her personal opinions and stupid comments, she really got on my nerves. I wanted to herar the stories, not her story."
3,Teenagers Can't Write As Well,"I felt like other teenage girls and I could relate to the book easily. I think the main weakness of the book is that the girls didn't write very well. I don't think this should really be surprising, though, considering none of them have been formally taught. Reviving Ophelia was more interesting to me because it felt much more unrestricted."
2,couldn't relate,"When I first saw this book I thought that, as a fifteen year old girl, surely I would be able to relate to some of the girls stories. I found it hard to relate to any of them. I think that this book makes it seem as if all girls have problems such as the ones the girls in the book have. I'm happy to say that the overwhelming majority of girls that I know do not have eating disorders or problems with depression and suicide."
5,Another Book for (mid-late) Teen Girls,"If you are looking for a book that will empower you as a young woman, try Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me proud to be a woman. I recommend this book to any woman who is sexual, wants to be sexual, or is just tired of getting crap for having a vagina."
3,"A little too dark, but poignant nonetheless","This book touches on most of the issues that affect teens today, but it could have done so without Shandler's commentary. Wonderful descriptions, and honest views on everything from crushes to suicide."
4,"A Social Worker's ""Adult"" Opinion","This book is a good resource for young girls and for adults, especially when dealing with the complexity of being a teenager and a young woman. However, I found this book somewhat disturbing in that many of these young girls are going through ALOT! It is a good read for all teenage girls, in that it hits issues that they can relate to/identify with, or at the very least learn from. I believe as parents and community members we can do a lot more!"
3,OK,"I am a teenage girl, but I felt I could relate to few of the stories. I identified with the ones about self image and friendship, but that was about it. I'll be the first to tell you that it isn't easy to be a teenager, but this book dwells only on the negative parts of the teenage years and fails to identify anything positive. However, there were some cute stories and well written poems, but all in all I was somewhat disappointed."
1,Sadly lacking,"A most disappointing book. A self absorbed litany of over-privileged adolescents bemoaning their lot. The style and depth of this book is so deeply lacking it is hard to focus on the bleak contents. Clearly some entries were no more that journal reiterations from a bad Monday! Unfortunately devoid of depth or clarity, this book has no redeeming qualities and was not worth the investment, either financial or in time."
1,"trivial, smarmy, a total waste of time to read.","What else is there to say, this is a pretentious book, which says even less than possible. It would be more suitable to appear in a teen magazine, or even Cosmopolitan magazine. I give Ophelia Speaks a minus 2 on a scale of 1 to 10."
2,"Ophelia may have spoken, but what about the others?","I read this book on a suggestion from a friend, before I read ""Reviving Ophelia"", because she wanted to see if I would be as dissapointed with it as she was. I was more so. While there are some outstanding essays in this collection, the bias of the editor clearly stands out. There is no one for the outcasts to relate to. There was no musician, nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion. There were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had. The sections are poorly named and divided. All in all, it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original. Some girls it may ""make feel less alone"", but for me it only accentuated the differences. Definately take out from the library before you buy it."
5,Telling it like it is,"In reading this book, I found it to be exactly like the life of a teenage girl. Anyone could read this book and get something out of it. In idea, it reminds me of the Chicken Soup series, but I enjoyed how it only focused on teenage girls and the struggles that they face. Excellent Read! Get it today!"
4,Compelling,I found the book very useful. It protrays the terrible problems many teenagers face today in a compassionate manner. If you are having a diffiuclt time with adolescence these stories will show you that you are not alone. The book does not pretend to represent a balance segment of the population but shows mostly people who are going through difficult situations. This is the kind of reading many teenagers are looking for in an effort to understand the world they are living in. Gripping read.
4,Random Slice of Life? Of course not!,"It's a little disconcerting to see people dismissing this book as ""unbelievable"" because ""not all girls go through such deep problems"". Well, of course not! The point of this book was not to give a bland, statistical overview of teenage girls today.The point of ""Ophelia Speaks"" is to allow teenage girls to speak about themselves. Just because there is much more to say about being anorexic than being happy with your weight should not cast unfavorable light on this book. It should be praised due to its acceptance of truth and reality."
2,Editor/author needs to back off,"Sara Shandler includes a number of powerful (and many melodramatic) teenage essays and poems in her book, but her introductions to each chapter and sub-chapter get old very quickly. Enough self-righteousness and self-disclosure: just give us the girls' voices and not authorial commentary."
2,Ophelia Speaks but has nothing to say,I was excited to read this book because I had read Reviving Ophelia and was looking forward to a different perspective on some of the same issues. I was disappointed. I wonder how these entries were selected and what the author's point was in selecting them.
2,one-sided,"Although I felt this book had very important essays in it, it was extremely depressing and not an accurate account of teenage girls. It was so heart-breaking. I know a lot of teens and this is not what is going on for most of them. I think it is important to shine light on darkness but also to not turn away from the light. Amore balanced presentation of teenage girls would have worked for me."
2,Is this what they really think?,"It seems that most of the essays written in this book were written by young drama queen girls who just wanted to be tortured souls. Yes, there were some valid essays that enlightened me, but some of them would have been better left in thier private journals where they can fantasize about all the pain and suffering they are enduring. Most of these girls need to learn about what it's really like being a woman-- a strong, independant woman."
2,Canadian OK,"This was mildly interesting as it tried to show Canadian film makers trying to deal with ""real Stars"" from Hollywood. I guess maybe if you are in the business this satire might work better but it fell a little short for me. Jennifer Tilly is the best of this movie but she's in so many better ones I'd skip this. Edie & Pen is a better comedy. ""Shadow of the Wolf"" & ""Bound"", are far better shows that she stars in even though they are of a completely different type."
1,Not Worth the 22 Cents I Paid for It!!!,"I struggled watching this film. I kept waiting for something to feel good about, but if there was any ""good"" there, I never saw it. This film is the only DVD I have ever thrown away (into the garbage) for fear it's awful story, acting and production might spread to my collection of over 700 DVD's."
1,Not Canada At Its Best,"Although I much admire Canadian humor and look forward to Canadian movies, I found this one a great disappointment. It promised to be a fine satire on both Canadian film aspirations and the absurdities of American pop culture. Instead it became an anti-American jumble of meaningless ideas."
2,USR: Not what it used to be,"This modem is very unreliable. It can't hold a connection for more than an hour before randomly cutting out. My wife's 56K modem (Apple) never misses a beat on same phone line. USR warranty is now only two years. On top of that, customer support by phone is only free for 90 days. After that you pay... for the privilege. You can probably buy a better modem for [the money]. By the way, that's what I'm gonna do."
4,Pleasant,"Jorg Becker is a fluent, if not especially distinctive, fortepianist. On this recording he plays an 1815 fortepiano that is really the star of the show. It is a beautiful instrument, with a resonant tone and none of the clanginess or wiriness one associates with fortepianos. It is recorded in a resonant acoustic and is really pleasant to listen to. There are three sonatas here by different sons of J.S. Bach. The sonata by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach has some awkward moments interpretatively which I don't know whether to ascribe to the soloist or the instrument. The other two Bach fils sonatas go very well, especially the nifty sonata by J.C. Bach. Mozart's famous K.545 sonata gets a worthy run through, while the sonatas by Benda and Dussek are less appealing. This CD is mostly worth acquiring to hear a fine original instrument in this repertoire."
4,Raw and Uncut Hip Hop,"If you dont know anything about SMACK just know it features up and coming rappers as well as seasoned veterans. This edition of smack features Eminem on the cover. His interview was kind've boring as well as Slim Thug's. I enjoyed Corey Gunz ""comfort and joy"" video as well as Shea Davis grimmy video. But the highlight of every SMACK DVD comes at the end. That is when the freestyle battle goes down. Ruff Ryder and now retired MC Jin battles unknown MC Verse. At 1st Verse seems to be a wack rapper, as he claims he'll give Jin the 1st round. Then Verse tear into Jin like water through toilet paper. But as expected Jin makes a little comeback. The good thing about this battle is they both rap off the top of the dome. No writtens here folks, pure talent. This freestyle battle was sort of a tie but you can judge for yourself."
2,Totally Pointless!,"I remember seeing 101 Dalmatians back when it was first released in 1996, and I was sure I'd enjoyed it. What bought back the memories was seeing a review of it in a magazine, so, I decide to go and rent it from the video store. Well, second time round, 101 Dalmatians was a a total let-down and I think I must of been drunk to like it the original time I'd seen it.Glenn Close is very watchable in her fall-into-bucket-of-poo state, but the rest of the team are largely miscast in roles which have put cheesier smiles on their face than you can imagine. The dogs are pretty cool, as they are in the sequel, but this film remains entirely pointless, it's just the dogs doing exactly what the animated one's did, except they don't speakm, and Cruella been a touch more likeable than in the Disney version.Sometimes entertaining, but unnecessary and annoying.101 Dalmatians: C-"
3,O.K.,"I received the DVD very quickly but it won't play a couple of chapters and it skips some. I emailed the company for help with either returning it or getting a replacement but unless my internet service blocked their reply, I didn't receive one. Wish I could get a replacement, though."
3,"Cute, but nowhere near as charming as the animated movie.","Yes, Glenn Close is perfect as Cruella De Vil. And, yeah, it's neat to see a small army of puppies roaming the screen. But that's probably not enough for most audience members, and it wasn't enough for me: The live-action ""101 Dalmatians"" substitutes slapstick for heart, plot and ... well, everything. I don't doubt that small children will get a kick out of bicycles crashing into ponds, dogs biting people on the rear end, dogs urinating on floors and people getting an electric fence to the crotch. But adults will almost certainly notice that they haven't gotten anything in the way of more sophisticated jokes, plots or fully developed characters to entertain them.This is a rental, except for families with young, slapstick-loving children. I suggest parents have a book nearby for ""family movie time,"" though."
3,Not as good as its previous incarnations,"The Hundred and One Dalmatians, the book, was excellent. The animated movie Disney made out of it was very good. The live action movie, however, fell short. The storyline was, expectably, not as true. The humor is aimed more toward the lowest common denominator. The cat characters have been edited out. :("
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IN HISTORY,"I can't tell you how much I love this. This is a gazillion times better than the animated feature : Better developed, more hilarious, better adapted and better performed. If you don't see this, you don't know what you're missing. It's highly recommended for all Disney/Animal/Comedy/Family Entertainment fans. This is definetely 100% better than that garbage they call 'Titanic'"
1,Did not work,"DVD did not work. Disc was clean, no scratches, but it must have been a bad disc. No dvd player would play it"
1,Terrible-Worst Product I have ever received from Amazon,The DVD of 101 Dalmations is so digitally scratched that it would not even come up and allow us to play rendering it unwatchable. I have never had this happen before and up until I received this DVD I have been supremely satisfied with all products I have ordered through Amazon.
1,did not work,"When I unwrapped this Dvd and pop it in the player it said ""unable to play in your region??? SO I sent it back we will see what happens."
1,sorry,"was very sorry i bought this video, didn't realize it came from the uk. maybe it told me when i ordered it, and i didn't read that part, i was just so excited to get it for my grandson, then when it did arrive from the uk and we couldn't view it i was really mad, wanted to return it, but cost me as much to mail it back as it did to purchase it. so one for the uk and none for my grandson!"
1,Not such a good deal after all.,"Movie would not play at all, tried it on two or three different players. My little grand daughter was so disappointed, it's her favorite ""puppy movie."" Waste of money, that's for sure. Certainly should have been advised where it would play."
1,Blank Disc,The disc contains no recording of the movie. It's completely blank. I've ordered other DVD's from Amazon before with no problem so this time I threw out the packaging and return label and mailed the DVD to my daughter in NJ for my granddaughter's birthday. Weeks later she decides to watch it and it's a blank. I tell her not to go through the expense of shipping it back to me but to wait for me to visit her. I just came back and now have the DVD. I played it on my DVD player and sure enough it's blank. I need to have a replacement. Please forward to Customer Service and advise me my next step. Rosaria Guida
1,waste of money didnt work,I feel my title said it all. I purchased the movie (condition new) when I recieved it the case was broken. The disc looked fine. We tried to watch the movie and a message poped up saying the disc doesnt work in this regin. I have never heard of such a thing. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY
4,BE careful huge differnce between 2008DVD and 2000 DVDs,"Amazon throwing reviews for same titled products, which exist in two very differnt formats, often creates problems and we certainly have one here.There are two US releases of the widescreen version 101 Dalmations: One from December 20o0 and one from the Fall of 2008.The 2000 version is letterboxed wide screen. the 2008 (the one you definitely want if you have a widescreen TV) is anamorphic wide screen.If you have a widescreen TV and you get the 2000 DVD (asn: 1558908374) the picture will be terrible compared to the much better 2008 edition (asn: B001B1T7BU)Now I am not talking about SD (standard definition) vs Blu Ray (HD), or widescreen vs 4:3, but about what happens to a 2:35 (ultra widescreen) film like this when letter boxed as the 2000 version does. this means that half the data of the film is thrown a way. The resolution of the 2000 dvd is very very low quality compared to the same aspect ratio on the 2008 dvd."
1,Lots of noise and very few words!,"I bought this movie for my little ones and for myself to help us improve our Spanish. I was surprised at the amount of noise (loud background sound effects, yelling, etc.) and lack of actual dialogue. I have since bought the Spanish dubbed Toy Story and it is excellent."
1,Horrible experience,"Very disapointed, bought DVD for my granddaughter for Christmas. She's wanted this movie for a long time. When we put the DVD to play, we can't see it. We get a message WRONG REGION. We have never seem this message. She was so upset and cried for awhile. It was terrible!"
1,CORNY!,"One of the WORST films by Disney is this ""101 Dalmations"", which is a live-action version of the original cartoon movie & is nowhere near as good. All it was is just a retelling of the story obviously, but very little excitement and fun, bad acting and cheesy, cheesy, cheesy special effects. (not to mention the jokes sucked!) It is also TOO short! They could've added in more and it would've been better but it all ended too soon. Disney is really going downhill with these sequels and remakes and I suggest that they STOP now!! How anybody could like this film is beyond me! This is the stupidest, crappiest movie remake ever! Save your money and buy the original cartoon version instead cause it's 100% better than this smelly pile of dog crap! Your kids will also like it more."
1,Waste of money,"This DVD will not play comes up with ""out of region"" message so was a total waste of money. Not sure how to get this replaced with one that will play for my granddaughter!"
1,Wrong Region,"Don't be fooled by the low price. Read the entire ad, especially the fine print. Some sellers knowingly sell DVD's formatted for foreign regions (intended for use Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt) to buyers in the U.S. When you ask to return them, they send you a two page e-mail telling you (in so many words) that you should have read the fine print and you need to ship it back as your cost, meaning you pay for shipping coming and going."
4,Gift was appreciated,I was very pleased with the item I ordered and it was received very quickly. I gave it as a gift. My friend has a dog that loves to watch animal movies. The dog loved the movie.
2,101 Dalmations Live action,"Shoddy make money crap. Stick with the animated classic, period. If you feel the need to see live puppies talk might I suggest 'Looks who's talking now'."
3,Weird format,I have had this dvd for a while. I gave it as a gift and recently found out that it can not be viewed on any dvd player here in the United States. It is in UK format....there are no options to change this anywhere on the new blu ray dvd players we have or the old regular dvd players we have. Any suggestions?
3,WATCH OUT,THIS DVD WAS NOT FORMATTED FOR THIS REGION-SO IT WOULDN'T PLAY ON MY PLAYER- HAD TO SEND IT BACK. SO BEWARE WHEN YOU ORDER A DVD THAT IT WILL WORK IN YOUR REGION. I KNEW AND STILL ENDED UP WITH WRONG ITEM.
4,Fired Up!,"Friedrich really fires things up on this CD! He plays some unbelievable things on this disc, which has The Honnegger Intrada, Hindemith Sonate, Stravinsky Fanfare for a New Theatre, and other really hard tunes. He really gets it out front on every track!"
4,Overall nice costume,"This was a nice costume for my husband. The quality of the fabric is okay - not great, but will last a few years. We added a big Space Shuttle patch to the back, because it looked a little plain."
5,Very good....,"music. Very easy to listen to, as we say in Sweden ""en lisa för själen"". Recommended!"
3,could have been better,The book did not end just left you hanging so if you want to know what happens you have to buy the next book. I enjoyed the book but I don't like books that don't end it was like she just got tired and said I think I will stop here. If she would have finished it I would have gave her 5 stars not 3. I don't know if I will buy the other book or not I don't want another book that doesn't end.
2,"Should be titled ""one dim bulb""","Mickee Madden, ""One Bright Star"", Pinnacle, 1997. Should be titled one dim bulb. The story idea is great. The execution is dismal. Mickee only fully develops a single character, her heroine, the dual entity Brehan Tucker, who has a fiery spirit, a horrific past and impressive powers when under the influence of her co-being. She doesn't supply enough information for the reader to care about any of the other characters, except possibly Brehan's alien love god. The story jumps from one unconnected scene to another making it incredibly difficult for the reader to get involved."
3,"strange, yet interesting","OK, the back totally doesn't match the story. what boyfriend, what journalism career? Did someone read another book then write the blurb for this one mistakenly. Besides that, its hard for me to empathize with the character when I don't know if she's a split personality, has an alien being within her, or what. I know this will probably come out in the sequel/s, but for now I'm just confused. Otherwise, I like the unique plot and the way Brehan doesn't just give in when she feels lust in her bones."
5,Loved the plot and the strength of the female character,"This book showed the strength of women against male superiority. Loved the plot and the added twist of supernatural. But I think that if a book is too have a second part, warn the reader before hand. Each book should finish when you finish it, don't make the audience wait"
4,"Very interesting, just wish ending ended. Sequel to follow.",Loved the concept and story line. The author keeps enough happening to entertain you. I didn't enjoy getting to the end of the book and finding out that I'll have to wait for the sequel to see how the story ends. I enjoy sequels but each book should stand on its own
4,Where is the end???,I loved this book.But it has been such a long time sence I read it I can't remeber half of what I read.So please get the rest to us as fast as you can.I can't wait to finsh it.
3,Disappointing,"This book seems to focus on what to do when a bully forces you out of your job. It is useful in that way. But if you like your job and want to stay or can't afford to lose your job, then it is not useful. It basically says you don't have much chance against a bully, which may be the sad truth. But one would like to learn how to deal with a bully and keep the job."
5,When you work for a bully,I worked for a bully for 3 1/2 years and this book helped me recognize and survive the bullying tactics.
4,"Very good helmet, typical Giro quality","This is a very nice helmet which was acquired at a very reasonable cost for the quality construction that you get. With a lot of the new Giro models out this one probably doesn't get the high kudos that it should. Very comfortable and very sharp!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that at high speeds such as whizzing downhill there seems to be a bit more wind noise created by my ears than my last Giro. However, not enough of a complaint to keep me from using it every day."
5,Road biker,This helmet was worth the money. The customization options were nice. The red and white colors look nice too! Definitely recommend.
4,Very good historical overview of the Reformation. Theology?...well...,"This book is quite a page-turner when it comes to history of the Reformation. I was hooked right from page one. Various historical characters come into play with the main performers being Luther and Calvin.When it comes to the theological ideas of the times the book misses its mark. I do understand that the text is meant for ""armchair theologians"", but even ""armchair guys"" need some meat in the soup. There is nary a one Bible reference to corroborate or demolish any of the theological ideas introduced. This was a disappointment.It would be more appropriate to title this text as ""The Reformation for Armchair Historians""."
4,A Page Turner,"I read this book all in one night, the night I bought it. It provides an excellent introduction into Reformation history and some Reformation theology. The book is helpful for an introduction to the Reformation and is quite humorous with its cartoons and puns. I would give this book a five, but I thought the book delved to much into exquisite details about the history of the Reformation and there should have been more theology. It is true though, that there was much political agendas set with the onset of the Reformation, but in some chapters, the book presented mainly history and not enough theology. A good buy!"
2,Is the Apple among the Oranges.,"This book is one of, if not the most, disappointing books in the Armchair series. Many reviewers have looked past a very basic problem with this book and is actually glaring and misleads readers, namely, it is not a theological text, but a historical one. One cannot doubt Sunshine's wonderful and easily-read presentation of Reformation history, but the series is about theology and because Sunshine has focused so much on the history, we get no information on Arminus, the synod of Dort, or the Arminian confessions of 1621. This is disturbing, as Arminus has influenced too much of the historical and theological landscape to leave his thought out of a book on the Reformation.In the end, I cannot recommend this book because it does not fulfill the requirement of the series, namely to introduce readers PRIMARILY to Reformation theology. HOWEVER, if Westminster John Knox starts a series entitled: Armchair Historians, I will give the book more stars."
4,Sf Planet excellent customer service,"Although the battery I purchased was not compatible with my camera, I can sincerely say that the customer service I received from SF Planet was very professional, courteous and prompt! Thank you SF Planet."
5,Children will appreciate this book.,It is an emergent reader for people beginning to read. I have the Spanish/English version and my Spanish students will appreciate that they have access to Spanish too.
5,preacher and prayer,"a book any preacher wanting to really do a work for GOD, must have. prayer involves GOD in ministry. Far greater than education or organization. This book clearly lays out the call for effectival fervent prayer for GOD to be involved in success."
4,The Frontier Plains,"This book was my first Western. I thouht it was wonderful. It is about a Southern gentleman and his young companion who have great adventures on the great plains. The book is filled with fun, adventure, mischief, love, and danger! There are several unexpected plot twists that keep the story moving.This book is definitley worth the read."
4,Perfect for stargazing on a budget,"Bushnell always makes quality products that are still affordable for the everyday Joe, no exception here. This is a very nice telescope and a great baragain at its price. This is a perfect way for children (or adults) to learn more about stars, planets and everything else that lies out there in the universe. I highly recommend this product. You'll be amazed at what you've been missing out there. :o)"
1,Not all that good,"This scope is not really very good for viewing planets but is ok for the moon if you stick with the 20MM eyepiece, the 5MM, giving about 140X, is just to much for this mount as it vibrates very easily and is hard to hold anything in the FOV for very long! I think it would be better for a person to buy a 4.5 inch reflector with a Dobsian mount for just a few bucks more."
1,Awful,This was what I chose for my 15 year prize from work. It went to the curb for trash pick up just the other day. Junk is what it is. I was so excited to have a new back deck this summer and use the telescope with my boys. Tried for about 2 hours and wasn't worth my time. The view finder was no help. We saw more without the lenses in! Don't wast your money.
4,There's nothing like seeing them all together,"This would be a 5 star book if the reproductions were just a bit larger, but it's a small complaint. If you like Hopper you will enjoy discovering works you've never seen before. If you're a painter too, you'll like the format: 1 page of introductory text and nothing but reproductions after that! Lots of people are familiar with Hopper's quote ""All I ever wanted to paint was sunlight on the side of a house."" This is the book that makes you understand what he meant: his mostly on-sight watercolors have a sun drenched quality that his oils didn't catch as often, good as they are. Hard to imagine anyone being disappointed by this book."
2,Does not hold for long,This stuff is specially made to attach emblems to painteted surfaces right? No. WRONG.I used it to reattach my badges. It worked OK until I came to wash it the next time and I noticed they were loose. Hmmm. Weird. They peeled right off and I reapplied some more glue and reattached. After 2-3 days I was polishing my car and the polisher ripped the emblem off and spun it around under the pad! NEVER happens with tape. After reapplying the stuff 4 TIMES I gave up and bought some 3M VHB tape (very high bond) that I will use instead. Pretty disappointed with this junk.
2,Looks nice but lasts that way only two months,"I was very excited when I saw all the internal bags this bag had. It's spacy enough even if you have a 17"" laptop. It's comfortable and looks good. I can put all my stuff in the different places, which are very comfortable. Most people wouldn't think that it contains a laptop. HOWEVER, the pieces (zipper, ""arma"") started falling apart after 2 months of use. I asked for help from ebags but they never returned my questions. If i were you, I would buy a LLBean bag. THOSE one really last and have guarantee."
3,fromm en el esplendor de su pensar,"""El arte de amar"" (1956) afianzarían el prestigio logrado por el psicoanalista alemán Erich Fromm, sobre todo en ambientes universitarios. En estos textos escribiría acerca de su teoría del ""amor maduro"" como ingrediente para una realización individual que permitiera escapar a la enajenación producida por la sociedad de consumo o la omnipotencia del propio Estado. Se empeñaría en armonizar el marxismo y el psicoanálisis, al mismo tiempo que abrazaría en su pensamiento las aportaciones de Oriente, siendo fruto de esta reflexión su obra ""Budismo zen y psicoanálisis""."
4,ANOTHER HIT,"Oro Solido keeps putting out fun music. The music is a good warm-up for a night out Latin dancing. Very upbeat, as always. A must buy."
5,nice addition,"This style (I purchased the hook, towel ring, and TP holder for a 1/2 bath) is very elegant, and the items are fairly heavy-weight. I am impressed with the quality, and they look fantastic in my bathroom! The drywall anchors included with the pieces seem to hold pretty securely, too.As a side note, they were well-packed. The post office unfortunately left this package outside my garage door while I was home, unbeknownst to me, and I backed my Jeep over it! The box was torn to shreds, but none of the pieces were damaged inside! I think I drove directly over the hook, too!"
5,"Solid, works for my purposes","Made of high quality, comes with color coding chart, tested it before installing and it works. I have an 04 Sequoia with the JBL sound system, and needed this to redo my speakers. Trying to keep stock head unit and replace everything else."
2,"Knowledge@Wharton is great, but this book is shallow!","If you're impressed with platitudes, by all means read this book. It's amazing how obvious some of the recommendations are. ""Target profitable customers, and avoid unprofitable ones."" ""Form a consistent corporate strategy, and stick to it -- until, of course, the time comes to abandon it, and then abandon it."" Wow. Deep stuff.If the authors had spent more time explaining how to know when to change strategies, rather than focusing on hindsight, this book could have been powerful. It's a shame, really. Singh and Clemons have published much deeper research in strategy and MIS journals. Knowledge@Wharton is free to subscribe to, and quite interesting, but there's no need to pay for two-year-old stuff."
2,Very Weak - Lacking Substance,"This book was extremely weak, basically, it just lacked substance. The author's wrote in extremely high level business/technologies terms that yield almost zero insight.I definitely don't recommend this book unless you are looking for a VERY fluffy high level overview of how technology can transform an organization."
2,Should of read the other reviews,"I should of read the other reviews before buying this book. There is nothing in it. Big text, lots of space and a few interesting stories, but no real useful information. I'm returning the book and getting my money back. Wharton should be ashamed to lend their good name to such a shallow book."
4,"Because we have been busy, they read it for us","This book is a must for Who fans who haven't been able to keep up since the tv series ending. Pearson divides each review into several sections including ones titled sex and spirits, things you need (essentially discussing the sci fi technology in the story), character developments etc.The reviews are written in a laid back style which not only tells you the gist of each novel/audio, but also makes it enjoyable and funny at times.Overall worth the $."
2,My kids didn't care for it at all.,"We are farmers and my kids didn't listen at all to this story. Maybe it will grow on them, who knows."
5,Really Interesting.,"Really interesting discussion about how biology affects technology and technology affects biology. Written in 1974, but still proposes valid arguments today. Premise is that man made Western technology has far evolved past the evoloution of our biological structures. Lots of interesting information on bushmen as an example of human biology versus modern (1974) technology. Give a bushman a driver's liscence??? Technology = Tools. Tech as tools to solve problems over time creating more problems. Want to get around faster -> cars and roads -> pollution and harm to human being's health. There is no problem free tech. Some unsupported dehumanization through technology stuff. Sounds like this guy might be a bit of a anti-tech."
1,"Sorry, Sub Debs","I don't want to be too vicious or aggressive, but this has to be one of the most inept and badly constructed albums I've ever heard. This group cannot sing, cannot play, and cannot write. Please, try something else; there's plenty of good music out there."
4,Good Movie,"I enjoyed this movie. A little slow at some parts, but I found it entertaining, funny, and a little scary. I liked most of the characters. The special effects were pretty good considering the budget. Nice work overall. Worth a watch!"
2,A not so scary movie,"Sarah the main character aka vilan, plays the stalker kinda person. She however does not have the lead in the movie, meaning she is not what you see on the cover. This film lacks its gore, however has some graphic scenes. worth the rental, But do not buy, unless you like a dead hore..."
1,"Love Maidenform, but not this one...","Have worn the same size Maidenform bra for years. They discontinue styles constantly, so I have to keep switching. Figured I'd try this one - but the fit is TOTALLY different. Way, way too snug around the chest, very uncomfortable. Order UP in the ""number"" if you must order...cup size seemed OK."
3,beautiful... just not very comfortable.,"I was glad to find that they actually carried my size in this bra, however, when I received it, it was a bit tight, and there were parts in the front that were constantly digging in to my skin."
1,What size is this?,"I ordered a 36dd which is my true size, only to be disappointed with a strange fitting bra, that is VERY uncomfortable. The bra appears to have the appropriate cup size, but the fit is bizarre and I am very squished. The underwire leaves huge red marks on my sternum and I feel like it is meant to spread and smash your chest . It definitely didnt do miracles for me!"
4,Great Product - ok Service,I had to return this product for another size....The service at Maidenform leaves something to be desired. My advice is Great Bra - just be prepared to wait if you need a replacement.
1,Beware of Hidden Fees,"Amazon will add additional shipping charges that will not appear during the checkout process! By the time you find out - it will be too late to cancel your order. Take your business elswhere, unless you like costly surprises."
5,Happy Customer,"I had already purchased the Dream Bra at a local store, but I wasn't able to find one in my size and in the color I wanted. I have a hard time finding bras that fit well and aren't Grandma bras, the straps are thin and I can't say enough about it!"
4,Maidenform Fabulous Fit Bra,This product lives up to its name.It fits very well and keeps its shape when washed on delicate cycle.
1,Disappointed,"I have purchased this brand and model bra many times before from retail stores. I jumped at the chance to get it at a lower price and bought two on [...]. After one wearing each, the tab where the strap hooks onto came apart making both useless. I am very disappointed with the workmanship. I am wondering if they were defects or seconds. I won't order this product again."
4,Works...separate drawer???,"Soooo....another peeler went to trash and it was time to get a new one. This contraption looked decent, price was good so here we go. Bottom line is the contraption does work. The small teeth on the blade do good work on things like asparagus. There is one wrinkle...this thing is huge when it comes to peelers. Certainly larger than any peeler I have ever seen."
5,best vegetable peeler!,"I love this peeler. It is comfortable to hold and peels well. It is much, much better than the old metal kind. I liked it so much, I purchased extras for friends"
1,Not What You Expect!,"This paticular purchase is not a course, but merely 2 tapes. It is a continuation of a complete set (introductory, intermediate, advanced). So if you actually want a course, you need to buy the introductory and intermediate course (actually just a bunch of ... tapes)."
5,The Food of France,"Without a doubt one of the very best written journeys through French cuisine via the country and the way it cooks food. Wonderful introduction to the best of French wines, just the right touch of history per region or dish - all vital to the appreciation of the food. It inspires the desire to take a slow 3 or 4 month tour with your appetite and this book as your guide."
5,this product is wonderful,Goes on smoothe with no oily feeling. Also moisturizes as it protects from the sun. Dermatologist recommended it. Shame Aveda quit making the product.
1,Add claims wiring KIT- not true,"Add states that this is a Wiring Kit with harness and relays. Not eve nthe picture displayed matched what was sent to me. All I received was the switch - no switch holder as depicted i nthe picture- no harness, no relay and wiring as mentioned in product details. All Customer service would do is refund me the money. they would not investigate getting me the correct parts as the add mentions or even modify the add to explain the actul product. WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH AMAZON AGAIN... VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED...................."
5,Elendil Figure is Terrific,"I have all the LOTR Toybiz figures, and I think this last batch ranks best amongst them, with the Elendil and the Gil-Galad figures being the best of the entire lot. Isildur's face is very realistic, the costume is top notch, just a beautifully rendered action figure any way you look at it. I like the Trilogy packaging, too, because you can see him from three angles, instead of just face on like in the older packaging. Who knew collecting action figures could be so much fun?"
1,WARNING!!! Check out the address on the reviews!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Whoever this guy is from Short Hills, NJ has posted like 20 five-star reviews. I've also seen him do the same on other espresso machines. He either works for these companies or is a distributor or something.If you are researching espresso machines I would suggest keeping an eye out for this guy because he's trying to throw the averages. My suggestion would be to NOT purchase any of the machines he recommends.Amazon, your ratings system obviously needs some more checks and balances."
1,I'm tossing my Sintra today,"After reading good reviews, I bought this machine sight unseen. Big mistake. Filling the reservoirs was cumbersome and you couldn't see the water level on the coffee and trying to make a half pot was very difficult. The espresso coffee holder didn't fit easily on the machine and sometimes it took five minutes of fiddling to get it to seat.(doesn't help that you can't see what you are doing). So soon we stopped making espresso, thus getting around the fact that a coffee mug won't fit under the espresso head. The coffee maker was mediochre. The lid over the basket fit poorly and was difficult to seat. It easily clogs and leaks all over the sink, even right after a cleaning. Today I'm off to Zabars to buy myself a new coffee maker. And it won't be a Briel."
3,just one little detail.,"This machine makes very good coffee. And very good espresso. And it's well designed and easy to use. One thing that quickly becomes evident is that the facade of the machine isn't stainless steel as it appears in the photo - it's plastic, albeit silver, stainless steel-looking plastic. It looks rather cheap. It's a shame, too, because they almost had it - If they'd only spent just a couple dollars more on each machine in the production phase for a real metal faceplate, it would have been perfect."
1,Stopped Working after 1 Month,"I was initially pleased with this maker. However, it stopped making steam a month into its use. Of course, when you are over the magic 30 days after purchase, no such thing as a full refund.Major UNHAPPY."
3,Fancy looking machine with not-so-fancy results,"This machine makes good espresso and mediocre coffee. We bought this machine about 6 months ago. When we opened the box, the red and green plastic pieces which cover the indicator lights had all fallen off and were loose in the box. Once we were able to figure out how the machine worked in spite of those ""directions"", we were surprised at how loud the machine was while making the espresso. That said, we did find the finished product to be quite good and the frother works very well. On the other hand, we find the coffee produced to be not much warmer than lukewarm and we inevitably have to warm it up in the microwave. We are now in the market for a new machine without so many flaws."
1,2 months at home - 4 months in shop,"I agree with all the reviews to date. Machine makes excellent espresso and a decent cup of drip coffee.Quality is suspect. Instructions are poorly done - good indication of Briel's quality control process.Had the machine about 2 months when it stopped pumping. Sent to repair facility in NJ at a cost of ($$$) (in addition to ($$$) return fee). Numerous calls to service dept fell on deaf ears. No one could tell me what was wrong or when the machine would be returned. Finally after 4 months, machine arrived at my door. Machine worked well for about 2 weeks, then died. Frustrated - I demanded a refund for the maching including shipping. I would not recommend Briel to anyone ever."
2,Disappointed,"I spent some time looking at reviews for combo coffee/espresso machines, and this one got the best reviews. But the negative comments I read were 'spot-on'. There are some basic design flaws that just don't make any sense:- Adding water to the coffee maker is tough because the top only opens to a certain point. You can't use the coffee pot to measure and add water as you would with most coffee makers because you can't pour all of the water out of the pot. Its hard to explain, but a major design flaw.- The area below the express maker is too high for an express cup and too low for a standard express pot. Still haven't found something that fits properly.- The steaming element is very short and it is impossible to remove your espresso without hitting this very hot element.- The espresso is never very hot.This is not my first machine and I'm disappointed. Still looking for a great coffee/espresso combo"
1,Do NOT buy this machine...,"After reading multiple bad reviews, I thought, well... I love the slick look, and those terrible things won't happen to me.Oh it will and did. One year and 3 days later. I have a $400 dollar average coffee maker.The pump mechanism is exceptionally, scares the cat, noisy. The espresso and foaming features of this machine are no longer working. I'd say I got about 20 cups of decent espresso from it this year. At $20 a cup, I think I'll go to a coffee house. (I could be a hero and treat my friends everytime at that cost). Additionally, the foaming feature is really poor, I could probably make better bubbles with a plastic straw and microwaved milk.Unfortunately, while company is a big name in Europe, I live in the States. So parts and repair shops are very few and far between. The near impossible to find support line is 1-800-763-6699. Trust me you'll need it.What a let down, please don't be taken in by this piece of junk....."
1,Not worth the trouble,Returned this item 5 minutes after opening. Much 'cheaper' looking then web site pic indicated. It's a chrome plated/black plastic (not even close to a 'stainless steel' appearance)with a 'flimsy' cheap feel to the appliance. Took it into my wife for comments (with no leading the audience from me) -- her comments matched mine (not always the case in our 20 years of marriage). I have no ax to grind here -- ordering this product was a waste of my time
2,award to use,"By the time I get the darn thing in position to open the end and position it perfectly to grip the fish in the lip, the fish, has already broken my line and got a away. What waist of money and time. So frustrated with this and ""THE BIG ONE"" did get away."
5,Love this series,Can't wait to watch more! These are fantastic! I wish all the old radio episodes were available in DVD format.
5,"Truly a ""Special"" Edition","With the help of this book and the accompanying CD (worth gold) I have learnt and created tools in Excel that I could not in my entire career earlier.It is clear, easy, up-to-day and a great way to learn and refer to for any Excel work.If you just need one book for Excel from Beginner to Advanced -- this is it!Love this book. I wish I used this book for my business school assignments."
1,Waste of money,This book is a complete waste. Completely unorganized and hard to follow sequences. Examples are poorly structured and hard to understand. Don't buy this.
3,"A good overview, but not much VBA","This is a good overview of the main features of Excel. I learned a lot about features that are tucked away and hidden in menus that I had never seen before.However, the function examples are a bit lacking. The authors provide overviews of only the most common functions, and even then they lack good examples for most of them. Also, when they get into the Macro/VBA section, they provide only a brief overview without much detail. Also, one of the authors spends an inordinate amount of time showing how to create Gantt charts; This may or may not be what you want.Overall, a good book if you are new to Excel, but you'll need more if you use a lot of functions or macros."
3,Not totally thrilled with this item.,"Belle is my favorite princess. However, this particular doll is not. I am collector so the lack of brush is not necessary for me. However, if I was kid playing with her I would be disappointed. Also, I do not think a kid would be too thrilled that the storybook is just a thin booklet with just pictures. I am particularly bothered by the fact she did not come with underwear. So, I suggest if you purchase this doll for a child you go to a store that sells doll undergarments. Also, the face mask does not fit over her face. So, only purchase her if none of these things matter to you."
5,Excellent for a gluten-free snack!,I've ordered these twice now - and enjoy one with coffee in the morning at work. For some they might be a bit too sweet but for me they're just right. I really like the yogurt coating outside with a crunchy rice inside. You can definitely taste the coconut.
3,ok,It didnt meet my expectations. It tastes too plain and too sugary. The only flavor I detected was almonds. My sister went to London and brought home one of the cranberry bars that I loved. Its too bad Amazon doesnt sell the cranberry ones in the the magenta colored wrapping. Please oh PLEASE sell the ones with the cranberries and chocolate!! ah!
4,Impeccable Taste but unhealthy,The taste is very very good and it is quite addicting.But...Eating 3 of these a day can't be terribly healthy. There is a lot of sugar and fat packed into each bar.There had to be a reason why they are so dang good.
5,Airbrush hose,This is the item I was looking for.I found a Badger Airbrush compressor at a garage sale.Its hose was broken and I had a hard time finding the right one.This one connects a Badger Airbrush compressor with a BadgerAirbrush. Quality seems very good since it is from the original manufacturer.
5,Great airbrush hose.,"Made by Badger, a trusted name in airbrushing. I assume it can be used with any airbrush/compressor combination, as I believe the fittings are all standard. Importantly: The hose comes coiled and held together in the middle with an elastic. Which made me a bit concerned it might be prone to holding the packaging-bends along its length, as happens with electrical cords. Which would have been a bad thing, trying to struggle against the hose's desire to return to its packaged shape while using it. As it turns out, there was no need to worry. I've had it out of its package for just a few days, and it is light, supple, and completely free of packaging-shape ""memory"". Highly recommended."
4,Bedford Intro to Drama,"I love this book and how it gives the history of the plays, the period it was created in and information about the playwrights. I bought this book because my granddaughter is studying theatre and was having problems understanding the language usage of plays dating back to the Roman/Greco period and medieval times. Together we correspond over our webcams and go over the text. I actually enjoy it more than she does. Perhaps it is because I don't have to take the tests or write the papers."
2,Style has changed...beware,"I've been buying the Lily Waters Tara tote for years. I have 5, and for Christmas received the Tara tote in Twilight. Beware! The styling has changed. There is ONE interior pocket...used to have 6 like the Vera Bradley bags. I'm very disappointed! Might as well spend a bit more and get a Bradley bag if you like the interior organization."
3,Give a word description of colors... I thought I was buying black,"I saw a picture of the bag... liked it, but it looked black in the picture on the computer. I was surprised and disappointed when it arrived and turned out to be brown. Please give word descriptions as colors don't necessarily show accurately on the computer."
1,wrong item sent,I received a glass instead of this bag.I returned the glass & most of the money back and never got the purse.
5,A Cat WHO book,"Lilian Jackson Braun is an outstanding author and this is one of my most favorite book series. The book was shipped almost immediately and is like new. Although, I normally check out her books from the library in hardback when they are published, I purchase paperback copies later for my library so I can read them again later."
5,A superb combination of cats and mystery!!!!!,"This was the first ""Cat Who"" mystery that I read, and it has gotten me hooked on the whole series! This tantalizing whodunit has something for lovers of cats, mysteries, and (in this one book) Scotland. This is mystery at it's best. Viva Braun! Viva Koko! Viva Qwilleran! Viva Frobnitz!"
4,Another charming and enchanting tale.,"Lilian Jackson Braun has the talent of bringing a wholly and undoubtedly fictional scenario (I mean there can be no place on earth like Pickax!) to life with warmth, yet some sharpness. The characters and their doings, throughout this series, are more important than the crime and its final solution by Qwill and/or the cats. A lovely, heart-warming read always."
2,Dumpy the Dump Truck,"I was disappointed to find that there was an inscription written on the flyleaf. I purchased the book as a gift for a grandchild and now can't use it. I knew the book was used, but would have appreciated the information that it had been written in."
3,Dumpy the Dump Truck,"Readers might also enjoy The Little Black Truck by Libba Moore Gray, which was written before Dumpy and tells a similar story with wonderful illustrations ""that blanket rural life and the little black truck in an aura of affection.."" Booklist"
4,box of chocolates,"Not bad. Or at least an interesting assortment. Or a useful guide to a wide range of Warp acts. As someone else mentioned the first CD is better then the second. Labradford's remix of Freeze features an earsplitting high frequency shriek that makes the track unlistenable, and Oval's version of Big Loada has no redeeming features whatsoever. Apart from that a highly entertaining listen.Now, where's that programming button..."
4,Classic Dave Attell,"I love ""Insomniac"" and love his stand-up! This is a really good comedy CD - good amount of material. The first half is the best - it drags a little once he starts heckling the audience - he must have had too much to drink during the show. Still a great buy for a hilarious comedy album!"
5,No one ever tells that story.... until right now,"Dave Attell is the funniest man in the world. He has a unique blend of raunchy and outrageous comedy that will make most people laugh. He is extremely quick-witted and talks about topics most comedians steer clear of. Like the title suggests though, his humor isn't for kids or for self-righteous adults. He goes a bit far in some of his skits but even then turns it around and makes you laugh some more. If he EVER comes out with another CD, I will definately buy it. I have listened to his CD several times (something I have never done with other comedy CD's) and continue to laugh. HIGHLY recommended!"
2,Meh,"I'm a big fan of comics like Patton Oswalt, Mitch Hedberg, and Jim Gaffigan, and I've watched and enjoyed Insomniac, so I decided to get this CD. Unfortunately, it just doesn't measure up. There are a few funny bits but overall, the bits on the album rely too much on over-the-top shock value. Vulgar jokes don't bother me; I even enjoy them as long as they're well-executed, but throwing words like ""queer"" around just to try to get a laugh doesn't cut it. Sorry, Dave."
1,"closer, but still incomplete.","Sure, they added stuff like all the dvd keyword areas, and this time they got almost everything...but they still didn't add a weapons list again."
3,"TELEMANN ""The Day of Judgement"" [timing 70:43]","Hermann Max conducting the Rheinische Kantorei and the Kleine Konzert. Performers : Ann Monoyios, soprano; David Cordier, alto; Wilfried Jochens, tenor; Stephan Schreckenberger, bass.Positive review in Fanfare 1993 by Tom Moore, also posted on his home page at Princeton. Moore prefered this brisk 1992 recording to the slower 1966 one by Harnoncourt on Teldec."
2,"What a mess (mostly made of great music, though...)","This Cd has no info on personell and dates, and classical numbers from 30's (with Teddy Wilson and others) are freely mixed with her work from the 50's (with Peterson and others); some of the songs sound like bootleg recordings from her club dates in the 50's.Since there are so many fine editions, don't buy this; second star is given only because of the good music (many of her classical performances are on this shabby compillation)"
5,memories of her life,"Elizabeth Goudge wanted to answer questions from her friends and readers about her life. So many details on her family and the places where she lived, photos, and details on her books, the ones she loved, and mainly this period of time, when she was young, which seems so far away. It is marvellous to discover the persons the loved, for example her maternal grandma and how she depicted her in the book ""the arch in the tempest"". When pationnate by E.G.'s writings, this is just a wonderful book and such a gift."
2,Looks cool but quality is very poor,I liked the way it looked BUT it ripped apart in less than a month. I tried to contact the company about it but they never cared. I would consider something else instead.
5,"Fast delivery, great quality, best price!","5 years ago, I bought the same version of this straightener from a friend who was a hair supply store owner, and she told me it would be $80 with a %50 discount, so when I saw the $60 price tag from Goodman's, I was astonished. Not to mention that GA.MA straighteners are the best I have ever come across, especially for the price. I mean, CHI claims to be the best and sells for almost $160, and come on, they're not even Italian made! GA.MA straighteners are apparently not the easiest to find online or in stores, so I'm very happy Goodman's buys European products for those of us who desperately want them. I was alerted about my product being shipped the same day I bought it and it arrived around 8 or 9 days later (bc i ordered on a thursday). Overall great in every way."
5,Best in my collection,"I have bought several ""Healing"" CDs or downloads through the years, but this is by far my favorite and the one I listen to everyday.Dr. Ed Montgomery has a full, rich, soothing, compassionate, and impassionate voice. His rendering of the scriptures on this album is superb.I highly recommend this CD , or download."
4,Memorable and very well written,"The structure and style of this novel are engaging and effective. The interjections of the narrator force the reader to focus not only on Saffie's story, but to pull back from this narrow focus and absorb the author's bigger message. Her message is a grim one - that history teaches us little, and that human beings will continue to abuse and murder one another with the belief that their cause is right and justifiable. I think the reader could have understood the message with a little less input from the narrator whose voice was, at times, intrusive and tended to state the obvious. This is a novel that delivers a disturbing assessment of mankind, but it is beautifully written and gives the reader much food for thought. I will forever think of the philtrum (that funny little dent between your nose and your upper lip) as ""the mark of the angel"" now, and remember Ms. Huston's powerful book and message as I do."
1,a slow and depressing read,"Ughhh. This was a book club pick. The whole thing is bleak. When there is finally a glimmer of happiness for Saffie, it's based on lies and secrecy, thus affecting her son and husband. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Depressing,"I found this book to be so depressing. I kept waiting for the main chararcter, Saffie, to find happiness or atleast some contentment with her life. When she finally did find it I felt she was so dishonest and living such a lie that I could not be happy. Then to top it all of she teaches her son to live a dishonest life and that does not even touch on the ending, how tragic! It ended abruptly and with such heartbreak that I still feel down and I finished early today. The only reason I give it 2 stars is due to the historical content."
3,Pretty good,"I hadn't intended to read this book, even though it kept popping up on my recommendations list. A coworker brought it to me, however, with lots of praise, and I wasn't disappointed. Huston's prose is easy and engaging, if unconventional. Her characters really lived for me, too, despite my distance from place (Paris), time (late 1950s-early 1960s), and situation (war, adultery). I wasn't satisfied with the end, however, which seemed too abrupt. There was little to no falling action after the unlooked-for climax, and I felt a little cheated by that. Over all, it's worthy reading material, even for those not interested in ""end of the millenium"" fiction (I don't know where the reviewer got that, in all honesty; I was expecting some sort of futuristic apocolypse), and it made me look at current events such as Kosovo and Belgrade in a whole new light."
1,"The point, exactly?","Huston's voice and writing style are okay, but the storyline and conclusion are so unsatisfying and miserable, that I found myself wondering why I'd wasted time with The Mark of An Angel. Exactly what is it about? A psychotic woman, her poor husband and child, adultery, communism, war? If I'd received a clear message, I might have been able to withstand this depressing book."
3,"An old book, but so are the subjects","This is an overview of the fabric covered pre-Cherokee/Comanche Piper single engine line. It's moderately informative and its only failing is its age, as while the airplanes haven't changed the market for them has and so have regulations, user preferences, and market values. Airworthiness Directives are issued, fixes are designed, and new STC's are available for discretionary mods which alter the things you want to check for in some cases if you want to buy one.Since they were made in quantity and all parts are available from PMA vendors, prospective buyers need to check with experienced mechanics and owners first before even considering buying one. However, for do-it-yourself oriented people, they are often a better choice of airplane than the Cherokees that followed them."
2,pretty ordinary,"This book covers most of what you need but it is poorly written and a real struggle to learn from. It is more suited to someone who already knows it all and has a ""Oh I've forgotten about this or that property of vector fields. I'll just look it up. Oh there it is, how could I have forgotten"" moment. If you're an undergraduate and want to learn linear algebra try ""linear algebra"" by Anton."
2,Not a book for applied mathematicians,"The book sets out to be an introduction to linear algebra, starting out on the premise of sets and maps and going up in complexity to vectors spaces, matrices, systems of equations, and eigenvalues. For an introductory text though, I think the book does not cater to a wide enough audience in that it dwells too much on the pure maths aspects and does not give enough numerical explanations or ""real world"" examples. If you are a not a pure mathematician but would like to learn more about linear algebra because of its potential applications, then this would not be the right book for you. The writing style is inconsistent and somewhat dry in places. Sections are light where more explanations are needed, and verbose where conciseness would do."
4,Chock Full of Helpful Insurance Statistics,There are many statistics here that will help people who are looking to make a market for different types of property/casualty insurance. It has handy reference information that will help in a pinch. All information is correct and it has helped cut down on the purchase of individual books with the same information in it. Best money spent!! This book is updated annual and is usually available the first of every year.
4,It's Odyssey-You know it is good,"Although I still find the radio show better, the Odyssey animated shows are entertaining and full of wholesome value. You cannot go wrong with Odyssey."
4,A Great Product,I love this cell phone cover. I drop my phone way too much and it doesn't chip. Yaay!
4,Not her first record,"Several people in the reviews have said this is Oleta Adams's debut record. That isn't true--she recorded a live LP called ""Going on Record"" in 1983."
4,Beautiful music,"This release is exceptional. Each song is beautiful and is enjoyable to listen to over and over again. The only reason the product rating is less than a five star is that the CD has a scratch, and there-by skips through one of the songs...so, while the music is lovely - I am a bit dissapointed to receive a damaged CD."
5,tremendous start,"Like another reviewer, I was a fan of Oleta Adams from the first time i heard her on the Tears for Fears album 'Seeds of Love'. This album has been a favourite of mine for years. Usually I agree with Stephen Thomas Erlwine's reviews but I believe he missed the mark on this album. I disagree that this is a dated sounding album (unfortunately a statement I can not make when speaking of her follow up albums). This album sounds as beautiful and understated now as it did then. A personal favourite of mine is 'everything must change'. A gentle and slow track that shows her voice can soar and hang onto notes for dear life and then dip into quiet lushness. I only wish that her future albums were less - well just less because with Oleta, less is definately more."
4,Hypnotic Siren's Song,"What a magnificient voice.... unadorned without the tedious adornments and affectations so prevalent in her contempories, Oleta simply redefines songs making them completely her's as she does her listener's who upon playing this album will become fans. When I heard ""Get Here"" it ceased to be Brenda Russell's. The same goes for ""Everything Must Change"". If we remember Tears For Fears for nothing else, let us be thankful to them, for they were the ones who helped bring us Oleta Adams."
4,still her best album,"Oleta Adams' 1990 debut remains the finest example of her rich, rich alto voice matched with a bunch of mostly very strong songs and warm arrangements that surround but don't smother her beautiful singing. Production by Tears for Fears' Roland Orzabal is mellifluous while never bland and in the album's highlight, You've Got To Give Me Room, he pulls everything out except for Oleta's keyboards and a flugel horn. The space for her voice and the touching lyric is perfect. Oleta is often grouped with Anita Baker and Brenda Russell, but more often than not the timbre and fullness of her voice remind me of Gladys Knight. Unfortunately on some of her later albums, the material gets weaker and the production blander but on Circle Of One it all works wonderfully to create a very satisfying album that has not dated."
4,Informative,"We live just southwest of Sunset crater and Flagstaff. We live even closer (2 miles) from an extinct, or least we hope it is, volcano called Glassford Hill. So, we were very interested in reading the history behind the volcanoes in our area."
5,Effortless Swing,"If you are a beginner or intermediate golfer (or a frustrated one) save yourself a lot of money and time. Read this book!! I have spent a fortune in golf lessons, videos and gadgets to try to achieve a repeatable golf swing with very disappointing result. Then I read ""The Keys to the EFFORTLESS GOLF SWING."" The simple keys posed by Mr. McTeigue will have you hitting longer and straighter in no time. I took me two hours at the driving range to see dramatic results. But the best thing you'll get from the book is a clear understanding of the golf swing. Forget the pro, you'll know what you `re doing wrong."
1,This book has ruined my game....,"I read this book and followed the instructions as suggested e.g. ""now put this book down and practice the arc swing"" etc. I then practiced the swing for over a week at regular intervals. Then began trying the effortless swing to start playing again. I've never been a good player, but now I can't play at all. I've now had to go and pay for lessons to ""unlearn"" what this book has said. It all sounds good in the book, but if you're not a good player.... it may not help at all, and it can really stuff your game right up! I'll never buy another book like this one!"
2,the keys to the effortless golf swing,The book really does not contain anything new or different from other books. Easy to read but no new or revolutionary Material.
3,Meh.,"This book has some good points, some very good points actually, but any pro on YouTube will tell you the same...for free...and with video instruction. There are also some flaws in this teaching technique that most YouTube pros will tell you ""not"" to do (hip turn on the back swing should be less than 50 degrees, not a full turn).I have learned to swing via YouTube, and refined my swing through GolfTec instruction, and I tell you that there is not a book in the world that will help you more than lessons from a PGA Professional will. Don't skimp on your training or you will learn bad habits that will have to be broken from your muscle memory and frustration will set in because your swing will get worse before it gets better."
2,"Same old, same old",Very disappointing. The title suggests a unique and revolutionary approach towards establishing a repetitive golf swing. There is nothing unique or novel in McTeigue's words. Just a lot of fundamentally sound advice that has been stated in every other decent instruction book. His suggestions are correct but not unique.
2,Not for beginner and that is for sure,"Well, all these 5 stars rating must be coming from the experts or advanced golf player. Myself, being a beginner, have not learnt a thing from this book which has pages of words but not enough steps by steps pictures to guide a beginner"
4,Solid instruction,"Mr. McTeigue's 'Keys to the Effortless Swing' instructional was far ahead of its time - this film provides an excellent compliment to his gem of a book. I haven't seen anything in years from Michael McTeigue - too bad, his instructional articles were always spot on according to the people I know that are well-versed in bio-mechanics."
5,Wow....,"You know, I never thought these how-to-golf books would help. But after a friend told me I had to read this one I decided that my golf game couldn't get much worse. So I did, and Wow, I can honestly say that I am swinging better and my overall game has improved. The only problem now is my friends are saying I am going to have to get fewer strokes on the bets. Anyway can't recommend it enough!"
5,Best beginnner golf book: focuses on the fundamentals,"This instructional golf book foucuses on developing the fundamentals of the full swing in 7 easy steps. This is the first golf book (and I've read a few) that demystifies the golf swing. I lowered my score 10 ten strokes in 30 days. It is well worth your money, time and effort."
5,A Great Golf Instruction Book,"This book is beautifully constructed, concise, gracefully written, and should be of immense help to most golfers. If you've read Ernest Jones, Percy Boomer, or Jimmy Ballard (for example) and enjoyed the insights but found it difficult to transfer the written word to your swing, try ""The Keys ..."": You will read a book that may finally lead you to improve your game. My swing improved markedly after I came to understand author McTeigue's ""lighthouse turn"" (Lesson Two: Momentum)."
4,Hopes for improved golfing,The book is written clearly and concisely. It will be months before I can complete this review because it will take months for me to learn and use and re-learn and re-use the techniques taught in this book. My hopes are that when I get to that point I will be ecstatic about what the book has taught me. We shall see.
1,effortless income,Please don't waste $1.99 on this. Video was recorded in the early 80's with poor video quality. The fundamental he's teaching is old school style. Any youtube lessons will be better than this video. How did this video get such high rating?
3,"Getting a ""feel for""","Helpful in a sense that the author relates the instructional advice in a way I could see the steps in my mind as I read, in turn able to retain the info and apply on the practice tee."
3,not bad but not spectacular,This is an Ok swing book. The advantage of it is that it is short and easy to read. It does cover the basics in most ways but does not really present anything earth shattering. In learning to play golf because of how complex it is you are going to have to do some reading. This is not a bad book to include in your early reading. Hogans Fundamentals is better however. On the whole a three star effort
3,Not that extreme,"It's a nice cd, but it isn't pure grindcore, it's more like rockcore with some low pitched screams. Quite melodic and not at all extreme, there are some comparisons to the newer stuff of brutal truth."
4,"""Chicken Fryer""","Was looking for a deeper large capacity frying pan and thought I had found it. Not what I was looking for. Not as deep as I would prefer it to be. Other than that, I like the product."
2,Not really worth it,"One of these was recently installed on my Subaru XT Turbo, and it's already failing: it makes horrible noise and causes the car to stall from lack of fuel pressure. Also, this doesn't have the fuel pulsation damper that my car's OE pump and several aftermarket pumps include (possibly because this is a generic one-size-fits-all type of thing). I'd suggest looking at something else first."
1,Not GE product Fake Chinese Garbage,"I thought Amazon was a safe place to shop but it looks like it is going the way of fleabay and Cost co, they are succumbing to the large wave of Chinese garbage that is hitting our shores. I saved this box to open today and install for a Halloween party and behold it is falsely advertised as a GE product but when I took it out of the box I learned it is a Chinese product with a different name and I am disappointed that I did not buy the Philips brand I saw at Home Depot for a lower price. I have seen the tide change at Cost co too, where i have had to return many TVs and electronics because they are no longer carrying good value priced items. Buyer Beware. I need to look into filing a complaint with Amazon."
1,this is a hoax,"I was driven by the perfect review on this product, so I took the risk. Unfortunately mine arrived with dissappointment because I received a generic bulb from China. It is clear that It should be a GE but noooo! If you are planning to buy this, better check in Walmart first because it is cheaper and will save you a lot of money...I immediately file a complaint to amazon and to the seller. In fairness they gave me a fair game by giving me a full refund. Until now I haven't tried using it beacuse it is hard to find a fixture with the single bulb with this size."
5,UltraViolet Lights Rock,"A must have item for any party or ""man cave"". Got these for Halloween for my office and ended up leaving them in place after the fact. The bulbs were a little damaged on the contacts on one end but I expected worse considering what they had to go through to get to me. Shipping ""inside"" the lower 48 should get to you without issue. If you have the space for these full-size black lights, you'll love'em."
4,Black Lights,"These are the cheapest black lights that I could find. I searched multiple websites and places.The quality isn't cheap, but the price was the lowest around. I bought 16 of them to use for a 'cosmic' easter egg hunt.The kids loved the lights. They worked just great. These are some lights that i can keep around for a while. I also used themfor a bowling alley that we built and so the kids could go cosmic bowling. It was a great event and it was a great addition to have.You definitely want to wear white clothing so you really light up. Great product!"
5,cooling racks,Perfect for cookies and breads. Grids just the right size. Easy to store and to keep clean. I highly recommend these to anyone who bakes
3,cooling rack,I loved my cross wire cooling rack by Libertyware.Now it has rusted so it requires extra cleaning with each washing.
1,Rust Bucket,"I purchased two half-sheet pan nickel-plated wire racks from Ram Kitchen Supply. I had been searching without success for stainless wire racks, but figured I'd give the nickel-plated racks a try because they were only $5.99. After I received them, I ran them through the dishwasher and they rusted. I consider this to be an unacceptable defect in a cooking product, so I returned them for a full refund.Regarding Ram Kitchen Supply, despite the defective product, my experience with them was terrific. Ordering was easy and the shipping cost was reasonable, I received the racks very quickly, and they accepted and processed my return very quickly, with no hassles or fuss. I would not hesitate to order from Ram again."
1,Piece of junk - look elsewhere,"A real dud (a rare event on Amazon, happily). Food stuck to it, it was hard to clean, and worst of all it was covered in rust after a single trip through the dishwasher. I got rid of it and boughtChicago Metallic Extra Large Nonstick Cooling Rack 16.7-inch x 11.5-inch x .5-inchinstead, which is the same size, costs the same, and has performed much better."
2,Too flimsey,"The racks need to either be heavier, or have a center support of some sort. I bought three, and they all immediately bowed in the center - and all we've used them for are cookies! They were too expensive to ship back and we can still use them for cookies so we kept them, but don't buy them if you ever intend to put anything heavy on them."
4,The dimensions are spelled out,"Timothy rated this 1 star as he said he did not know the dimensions.The dimensions are clearly described above:Cross-wire grate so cakes, cookies and pastries don't fall through wiresWelded at end of each wireFits inside Half Size Sheet Pan or 13 x 18 Jelly Roll PanMeasures: 11 3/4"" x 16 1/2"" x 5/8""I appreciate his concerns but his review did not help me as I can see that he did not read all of the information posted for this product."
2,Rusted within 3 months,"The rack itself is great and pretty sturdy, but it rusted within a couple of months of use so I'll have to throw it away. I bought the CIA cooling rack around the same time, and have not had the same issue with that one.CIA 23304 Masters Collection 12 Inch x 17 Inch Wire Cooling Rack, Chrome Plate Steel"
3,Mixed Review,"I bought four of these cooling racks in December 2009. Because they were of such good quality, I ordered two more in December 2010. The last two were wavy and wobbly and would not sit level on the counter. The wires did not run parallel to the frames, and were rough in spots. I returned them. I really would like to have two more of the same rack, but will wait a while to reorder in hopes that the next round will be better."
1,"Oversized, poor description","This rack does not fit a half-sheet pan at all. Once in the pan, it does not rest on the bottom but edges the other side. You think you can press it down and make it fit but if you do that, the other side pops out - forget about having a level surface."
5,A great cookie cooling rack :),I was looking for a large cookie cooling rack so I wouldn't have to piece together several smaller ones in order to help cool one or two batches of cookies! I also hung it on my wall in the kitchen to take up less space than it would in the cabinets. Not much to say except it does the job!
4,Nice rack.,"Would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't started to show small rust spots at some of the welds after about a year of use. Still work, though."
1,Canceled order,I placed the order only to be notified several days later that it had been canceled. No explaination at all!
5,This is a bootleg. Z-Trip is not seeing a dime from it!,"Yo,Do not buy this! It is a bootleg, and Z-Trip is not seeing a dime from it. Check out Z's website for his own words on this product. www.djztrip.com."
3,Look before you leap,"This book was interesting, historically, and if you are thiking about showing a Shiba. But if you just bought a Shiba, it gives you little details. I would recommend it for a coffee table book, but not if you are looking for details on your puppy and training advice unique to Shibas."
5,Outstanding resource,"We knew very little about our shiba before we got her. From history to types, coloration, how they think and training this book does a great job for the new owner."
5,everything,"This book was recommended to me by another Shiba owner and I'm glad she did. More breed specific information than any other Shiba book I've seen. Also, there is a section regarding breeding. This is a book for serious Shiba Inu fans and anyone who is contemplating showing or breeding."
2,too much,I purchased this book expecting general information and training help. This book is largely made for show purposes. It has no useful information except if you want to breed and show the dog. I would not recommend the book for people wanting to know more about their Shiba Inu or wanting a training guide.
5,What a wonderful book!,"I found JUST FINE: Unmasking Chronic Illness and Pain to be a marvelous resource. I am personally dealing with several debilitating conditions that are not externally evident. The interviews in the second half of the book told my story. Here were people openly discussing thing I thought only I had experienced. The first half of the book is full of a vast amount of very useful information. The book reads well and is very moving an inspiring. Highly recommended to anyone dealing with chronic illness and/or pain AND family members, friends and coworkers. I think the medical profession could make great use of this book as a resource to improve the doctor patient relationship. I've not seen a book like this ""out there"". For those of us dealing with these difficult conditions and our families, this is a breath of fresh air. It is guaranteed to start much benefical dialog. I for one am very thankful that this book is available."
2,Warning,"I have a High Court's book for both my Property and Criminal law class. I am not impressed with either. They frequently miss major points in the cases, and worse, occasionally get the facts wrong (e.g. Regina v. Cunningham where the book claims that the victim, Mrs. Wade, was the defendant's prospective mother-in-law. FYI, she was the neighbor). They are good for obtaining a coarse understanding of the material when you haven't had to time to do the actual reading. However, in such instances it would be wise to return to the actual text book prior to outlining."
4,Fun but flimsy.,"This is one of the more interesting and engaging bead mazes I've come across, and my 12-month-old loves it. The only problem is that the blue wire track is easily bent out of alignment with the yellow wheel which the beads move through when turned. So after one month of serious toddler play the wheel sticks and won't turn. No other problems so far."
4,It is fun to play with the multiactivity maze,It is much fun to play with your kid with the multiactivity maze but it is better to keep your eye on your kid when he or she plays with it for safety reasons
4,Loads of fun,"When this toy was opened, the older children started playing with it even though it was purchased for a two year old. Even the childs dad had to give it a go."
5,Shadow Castle was my very first favorite book!,"At 40 I found it again and shared it with my own child. He saw immediately why his mother had so loved Mica's story. I used to have dreams of being the one flying with him, instead of Maria. I cannot describe how lovely it was to read this great book once again!"
5,A Most Enchanting Fair Tale,"I read this book when I was 8 and was so greatly impacted by it that I decided then and there, at that tender age, that my first daughter would be named Gloria in honor of the main character of the book. It is a fabulous story, extremely original, well written, mesmerizing. I loved it and still do."
5,Every child's Fantasy,"I first read this as an 8-yr-old, and fell in lovewith it. Now, at 20, I've had 6 copies of it; every time I lose one, I stumble across another. The story is magical, filled with fairies, princesses, and dragons. The characters are gifted with a subtle humor, and just a touch of reality that draws you in. And the very idea that this might one day happen to you, just like it did to Lucy, makes it even more beloved a tale. I keep reading it in hopes that one day I really will look like Bluebell! This will be the first book I give my children, and I know they'll love it as much as I do."
5,Best fairy tale ever!,"I first read this book when I was about 11 years old, when it was first published and the ink used in the book was green. I fell in love with it instantly and read and re-read it again and again. When my famly moved after my graduation from Puerto Rico to Florida, I had it packed with all my favorite books. Alas, I traveled to Calif. before our household belongings arrived in FL and when I came back from CA after six months, my folks had ""unpacked"" my stuff and my precious ""Shadow Castle"" was nowhere to be found. I have mourned its loss for thirty years now. I cannot express how thrilled I am to have found it again. Thanks to Amazon.com and all the wonderful vendors who carry long-lost and out of print books. I will not let this book leave my sight again! I am going to get an extra copy for my grand-daughter!"
1,Why you should NOT buy this book...,"I give credit for the catchy title! But I seriously have issues with neighbors and this book does nothing to help solve those issues. You will get a fluff of stories upon stories about how others have it bad. Then the solution for noisy neighbors will be to buy a set of earplugs and turn up your tv. I couldn't believe the book recommended that if the noise from neighbors comes from a teenager/college kid holding a house party -- to pay that kid to not have parties there. That's promoting extorsion and it's bribery. Do you really think once you start paying a kid not to have parties at his house, he/she won't ask for more money?! This book is STUPID, STUPID, STUPID unless you just love reading about how others have it more worst off -- like the senior citizen who kills his neighbors because they wouldn't allow him to have any nights rest with all the noise they made."
5,Heartouching,This is my favorite CD. it hasn't been off my stereo since I bought it. It makes me cry every time I listen to it and I can't wait for Kassie to release her second CD.
5,quality and price.,"after descent research, bought these s-video cables. the quality is there, the connections are rigid, and the price is correct. no loss on video. worth it."
3,StarTech S-video cable,"This product is ok, but it doesn't work on all t.v.'s. For some reason it won't fit a 4 pin t.v. I have, which according to all practicalities, it should. Remember, this product is just to give you another monitor. It will not promote sound; therefore, if you are looking to connect a laptop or other device, sound may not be included. I can connect one t.v. to it, so for that it was worth the price."
1,Not the best from Mr. Petit.,"Dear Fábio José da Silva.This is not the film you want to purchase. In fact, it's quite a boring ballet. I have never been too enthusiastic about Mr. Petit's talents... and this one may be one of the poorest things I've seen by this French choreographer. Sorry to have disappointed you."
2,What happen to the love song?,Me gusta mucho esta novela pero me desencante mucho cuando me di cuenta que el disco principal de esta novela ( si tu supieras ) by alejandro fernandez lo avian quitado y lo rremplazaron por otra musica rrara. Tampoco me gusto que borraron muchos episodios importante. :( si no fuera por eso le daria cinco estrellas
3,Me gusta mucho esta novela,Esta novela es muy buena . Pero no me gusto que este dvd no tiene la cacion Principal de la novela si tu supieras de alejandro fernandez. Y tambien le quitaron muchas esenas. En el dvd la novela no es tan larga como cuando la presentavan por la televicion
2,"Region 1, only suitable for US.","I live in Australia so it is difficult to find these sort of products here. I was happy to find Maria Isabel, however when I played it here didnt work in my dvd or PS3 since it is region 1 and here is region 4 (not even in the multiregion dvd) so I had to watch it in the computer which allows a limited number of region changes. That was disappointing. Obviously this product is for US residents only, that should be very clear before buying.The story was very edited, sometimes characters appeared without knowing how they met or what the relationship was. Also some important parts were missing. It was entertaining though."
2,"cliff notes version, not what I thought","I ordered this dvd because it is one my sister and I saw when we were younger and that is now being shown on an alternative tv station. We were so excited to see it but couldn't stand the wait between episodes, so I ordered this so we could watch it together but was really disapointed. This is basically the cliff notes version, a lot of scenes have been cut that the story is rushed and jumbled. It really takes away from the original passion and beauty of this Novela. I never really write reviews for the things I order but I was disapointed. I only rated 2 stars because the company was fast in shipping and delivery and it got her before the estimated date. So if you're ordering this dvd because you saw it on tv, my advice would be don't order it."
4,Great Deal,"We got these when the baby was born to keep down some of the dust - we put one in our room and one in the living room and they seem to work fine. They are very quiet and don't take up alot of space. They work for about a month or so without needing cleaned but cleaning is fairly easy and only takes a few minutes (plus a few more to dry).We use the car ones to, only I can't tell if there is much difference. I suppose they work fine as I don't seem to have to dust the dashboard as often."
1,"Does some cleaning, beware early failures.","Kinda the whole point of this thing is that it is supposed to be 1) quiet, 2) keep you from having to buy filters. How about buying a new unit instead? That's what you'll be doing - have had two of these and both have failed in under a year. Red cleaning light comes on and won't go out. No clue why - and Ionic Pro is no help. Way too much money to spend for such an unreliable product."
1,Less than I expected,"I purchased this product from a local variety store and after about 3 months it stopped working. I tried to contact the company with their customer service number with no luck (on hold, on hold, on hold---). I then tried to e-mail them asking for a replacement, and was put off and finally ignored. Very unhappy with this product."
1,Works great for a while - then dies,"I was very pleased with these units until about a month ago. I had them running continously for about 11 months...then both units started giving the red ""clean"" light no matter how clean they are. Several other people have written about this problem, so I won't do into further frustrating details.Bottom line: only buy these if you don't mind having them go bad for no apparent reason after about a year of use. It looks like Amazon offers a warranty for purchase, so that might be the way to go - but be sure to read the fine print to make sure you'll be able to have the units replaced when they inevitably go bad!"
2,not quite what was expected,"These seem to run quietly, but do not seem to work well, even in a small room. They will make a sizzling sound after a while and no idea why they do that. They are much smaller than expected and I have both of them in the same room. Even that is not as good of quality as an older Hunter brand I have that I was hoping to replace due to its age. Car ionizer does not seem to do any good in the car. Way too expensive for the quality of item purchased."
3,does absolutely nothing,"This gets an extra star just for visual appeal. Otherwise, completely useless - other than making noise!I bought this because I live in an attic along a very busy street. I wanted to reduce the pollution in my room, in addition to all the dust that keeps accumulating!!!! I thought it was working because there would be buildup on the blades. However, there was absolutely no reduction in dust!! I actually think it created more.It makes noise, which can be easily solved, but customer service is horrible. I cannot even return the item - it was too bulky to lug all the way to the post office, and now it's been over 30 days.Do not buy this item. It will be a complete waste of your money. Invest in a HEPA filter instead."
2,These things don't shut up!,"When I first got these, I was very happy. Then, about 4 months later, they started crackling. Yes, I took the time to clean them, and in a day (or even an hour in some cases) they would start crackling again. No matter how clean you get them, they continue to make that sound of a bug zapper or something. It is very frustrating. I have deep cleaned as well with no results beyond a day or two. Beyond that, I do notice a cleaner smell in the air when I have them on (which is rarely these days due to the noise). Also, when I do clean them, I do notice a sticky, black film on the blades, so I guess it is cleaning something out of the air... if only they would shut up!!!! I would not buy them again if I knew how they would perform."
5,I love mine!,"I bought the twin pack and was very skeptical as they are so quiet and I hardly felt any air movement from them. I have one in each bedroom. Before reading other reviews, I wondered if I was nuts. But the air in both rooms smells fresher, cleaner. I've just ordered a third, larger one for the living/dining room area. I'm also very happy to be able to clean blades rather than replace filters. I'm extremely happy with them and sorry I didn't get them sooner!"
4,Air Purifier,"Product works well. Noticing a huge difference. Didn't come with the bonus car ionizer, but i heard that doesn't do much so I don't really care."
4,Work right but too bright,"These units operate quietly and are used in our bedrooms. Without them, the bedrooms seem stuffy. Only problem is the ""power-on"" switch light on each unit is too bright and annoying. Covered the lights with electrical tape works as a quick fix. Haven't tried the car units."
3,Car Ionizers are worthless.,"I love the Compact Ionic Air Purifier ( freestanding one) and it seems to work great but the car ones I don't think work at all. Still great value and price even if I choose to trash the car ones. Guess that's why they are the ""bonus"" item."
3,"Not great, but OK.","I've always wondered if these things really work and in order to find out I just ordered these and tried them out myself. They do help with cleaning ""some"" dust in the air and they help eliminate odors a bit. Overall I was disappointed and expected quality air or something close to it. I would have returned them but I decided to keep these because cleaning some dust is better than nothing I guess."
1,Cheap Knockoff of Sharper Image,"This is a cheap knock off the original. The air flow is very flow compared to the first generation Ionic Breeze. These are about half the size of a normal Ionic Breeze. You have to tilt these on their side to use, and they have a really bright blue led for a power indicator. For the ability to clean the air... Not more cleaning power with these. Don't waste your money. Buy a real one.. I have both at home and these suck."
1,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY,"We bought this set of smaller air cleaners along with one of the larger models. Please see my review on that bigger model. The smaller ones didn't totally give out like the larger model, but the smell emitted from them concerned me (kind of a hot ""burning"" electronics smell) that I no longer trusted them in our children's room."
1,useless,"you can only smell the ions when its filthy, otherwise I notice no difference at all with having them on. you have to clean it once a month. the car ionizer are garbage also."
2,Not worth the silence,"The price, space and product is not worth it. It is silent but it removes very little from the air and plus if you open a door or window..poof the stuff out of the air is back. I have puppies and wanted to get rid of their fur on my clothes. This product did absolutely nothing for it. I bought a loud air filter and that seems to work better because it sucks in all the air. But it is loud!"
1,purifier,"DONT BUY THIS PURIFIER IS NO GOOD AT ALL, DONT UNDERSTAND WHY IS SOME PERSONS THAT DO RECOMENDED IT MAYBE THEY ARE NOT ALLERGIC ONLY LIKE THE SMELL OF CLEAN"
2,Worst things about any type of eletronic air purifiers,I have done tons of research on these type of electronic air purifiers including have family members how bought these as well. First I like to say that study and test show that Ionic Breeze has the lowest ratings possible and are made very cheap even there $800. dollar models. Also that 3rd party manufacturers like Ionic pro to name a few are built and filter the air a lot better the Ionic Breeze(brand name) models.The downside Unless you like the smell of air being electronic discharged like the smell of a lighting storm and headaches to go along with it then I would recommend to stay away from these regardless of the brand. If you don't mind it then go buy any nock off model just stay away from Ionic breeze which is made cheap and they also live up to marketing hype and advertisements to rely on business. Just like Blue-Ray dvds. Don't take my word for it do the research and see your self.
5,Passed his EKG in flying colors!,"Thanks to Cardio-strength, my 12 year old male Australian Kelpie who suffers from tachycardia, got an ""A"" from his specialist vet at his last heart check. He is also on heart medicine, but the vet noticed a huge improvement when we coupled it with cardio-strength."
5,Good stuff used it for years,Good stuff I have used it for years. way better price than I could get it locally. I use it on my scope screws for my airguns.
3,Caveat Emptor!,"I received the ""Make Your Own Tiki Bar Sign Kit"" today. I appreciate the fast shipping, but I was not too happy with the product itself.It appears to be a 'recycled' sign, in that one side is painted black, and I can see something like ""Daddy's Kabin"" underneath the paint in a tiki-style font.The advertisement stated you will receive ""1 BLANK DRIFTWOOD FEELING SIGN"". The product represented in the advertisement is not painted, therefore providing a truly blank canvas to work with. Now, I will have to adapt my originally intended design to work around the BLACK PAINTED surface.Truly a ""buyer beware"" product!"
4,"Excellent, but about 200 pages too long.","An excellent and engrossing book. However, was dissapointed in the way the ending was kind of drawn out. I felt that it could have ended about 200 pages sooner and not lost much. Still, was an engrossing read. Read it all the way through, even though the ending was not as strong as I would have liked."
3,Captains and the Kings,"The story, of course, was fantastic. However, the paperback was a reading nightmare. Some pages were blurred and others had type so light they werehardly readable. I didn't expect the 'best' when ordering a 'mass market' paperback but the poor quality really interrupted the story flow and impacted my reading enjoyment."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,"This book had to be the best one I had read in all of my life..I read this because I had to, but I totally fell into this book...It has a bit of everything starting with thrill, adventure, drama, romance, and a little bit of history...I recomment it to anyone"
5,An epic American novel,"Joseph Armbaugh was 12 years old when his mother brought him and his siblings from Ireland to America to reunite with his father. Tragedy occurred before that happened and Joseph was suddenly on his own, supporting his young brother and sister. He worked with driven single-mindedness to provide for his family and learned what it took to survive in his adopted land. He had goals for each person in his family, and was terribly disappointed when they had ideas of their own. His loveless marriage was arranged as a business deal and it allowed him to begin a relentless pursuit to make his son President of the United States. Although wealthy and powerful, he was no match for unseen forces which pulled strings and manipulated politicians, businessmen and countries. This is an American tragedy, written with beautiful prose, unrelenting realism, and extraordinary insight. It is a book you will not soon forget."
5,"WAKE UP, PEOPLE!",I READ C & K YEARS AGO......LOST THE BOOK IN A MOVE.....HAD TO HAVE IT AGAIN FOR MY LIBRARY AND POSTERITY. AFTER READ IT.....IT'S A REAL EYE OPENER FOR THOSE WHO ARE ASLEEP IN OUR SOCIETY.
5,Fantastic Read,I read this book many years ago and I'm still recommending it to all my friends. It is an interesting story with many twists and turns. It makes you stop and think......could this really happen?.......did this really happen? Absolutely recommend this book to all.
5,Hard-to-find book!,"I read this book 30 years ago, and wanted my grown son to read it. I couldn't find it in any library in my area. I was able to get a paperback copy from Amazon. I wanted my son to read a story about how governments are manipulated into creating wars to serve economic purposes."
5,"A ""Desert Island"" book","If I were marooned on a desert island, I would have to have this book with me! I read it in the 70s and have also enjoyed the mini-series many times over which starred the late Richard Jordan as Joseph Armagh. While it would be easy to draw parallels with the fictional Armagh family and the Kennedy dynasty, I prefer to think of the book as a testament to one Irish immigrant who found and then lost the American dream. The more disturbing aspect of the book (and one I always think of when a major news event takes place) is the presumption by the author that there are powerful men with money who control much of the destiny we call history. Do these men exist? Who can say? A riveting book and one worth more than one read."
2,It's not that great,"The movie is ok. It has some funny scenes especially the different dates that the main character had but the story is kind of all over the place. I do not see the point of the love scene between the two friends since they did not end up together anyways. I thought that the ending was too abrupt. And also, they talk about finding a proverbs 31 woman but this movie is filled with Sinful acts. Overall, I would not recommend to buy this movie maybe just rent it!!!"
5,"SEXY, SEXY, SEXY","A nice movie that makes you fall in love again...feel good movie! Christian K is always a nice piece of eye candy to watch. The atheletic trainer was extremely funny. The line about the black man dating the white girl could use some more acting lessons. The storyline was interesting and the chemistry between the couples was great. Kind of reminded you of coming to America but with a twist. It is a must BUY, WATCH, and tell a friend to do the same. Make you believe in finding the Perfect Combination to unlocking the doors to your perfec mate."
3,Movie OK,I purchased this movie because it was about relationships between Black people. It was ok but nothing special.
2,Don't Do it - Sober.....,"It missed.....on every possible connection. Unless you have NOTHING else to do....you should avoid wasting your time if you're in search of an actual motion picture and/or looking for any hint of a plot, script & acting. Even when I wished that it would - nothing in this film made sense. Even the predictable scenes were unexpectedly awkward. Just fast forward to the CREDITS.....these by far are the funniest part of this flick...although even then....the ENDING was sudden. I gave it a 2 for a few funny lines by the supporting actors....."
1,"Save, Save, Save","Save your dollar, quarter,nickel !! Why not save your penny too. It's not even worth that!! What a total waste of actors. What a total waste of my time. Wow what a waste of my dollar!"
4,Perfect Conbination,I love Christian Keyes he's a great actor and singer. The movie was funny and romantic. A must see movie.
2,Picky in Lake Stevens,"I have been a Devin user for well over a decade. Apparently, what I recieved is the ""new"" release of Devin. In this case ""New"" IS NOT BETTER. I prefer the original. I will have to find a different source for the real Devin. Too bad"
5,Devin fan,I've been using devin for about 40 years and always make sure I have a bottle.the scent is perfect not too strong
4,Good scent,Good scent but not the greatest for my husband. Everyone has their own best cologne. This is a good one but I like Monsouir (sp?) Musk better & Poco Robainne the best on him.
2,Just Say No,"My brother-in-law told me that he smelled this wonderful cologne at church and actually asked the guy what he was wearing. The guy told him Aramis. My cousin went on and on about how wonderful it smelled. I bought it online without testing it and that was a mistake. It is a very strong cologne and it smells - well, cheap. The smell of it made me think of some older person who was wearing cheap cologne and it is so strong that you better only spray a little bit on you or you will overpower everyone around you. Just say no to this cologne. Spend a little more and buy a lighter, fresher and more ""in"" cologne."
3,Pleasant scent...,This cologne was difficult to find. I was a little dissapointed that the scent didn't last very long.Seemed a little weak like it had been in storage a long time. Pricy too! It's gone now. I probably won'treorder this fragrance from the seller.
1,Love this cologne,"I have been using this cologne for 30 years. Impossible to find in retail stores anymore. I use it daily. It is not overbearing as many colognes are. Devin is very mild and not offensive to people that i come in contact with. Over the years i have many people ask me where they could get this cologne. I have never had a complaint from anyone that it was too strong. I have worked with the same people for many years. Believe me, if it was offensive i would have heard about it. People enloy the smell since it is so mild. I think it has been on the market since the mid seventies. I have other colognes that I wear on other occassions when i go out in the evenings."
1,cheap imitation - restructured product,"WHAT IS PICTURED .... THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT I RECEIVED. I ORDERED THIS SPECIFICALLY, SO AS TO NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE ""NEW PACKAGIN"" IN 3.4 OZ. AMAZON WAS VERY FAIR AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT MY COMPLAINT. IT WAS THE SELLER WHO MISREPRESENTED MY ORDER BY LISTING BOTH ITEMS NEXT TO EACH OTHER, GIVING THE BUYER A CHOICE. I CHOSE WHAAT I WANTED BY PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION, 3.7 OZ. NOT THE CASE. WELL, I FINALLY GOT A SHIPPING LABEL FROM THE SELLER AND RETURNED THE CRAP THAT WAS SENT. I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE BEEN CREDITED YET OR NOT. THE ARAMIS YOU SEE IN THIS PHOTO, BLUE/GREEN BOX IS MY ITEM, BEEN WEARING THIS SINCE 1978. THE STUFF SENT WAS DEPLORABLE....A NASTY TRICK. AMAZON WAS GOOD ABOUT THE WHOLE THING, THOUGH. I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY OF WHAT I ORDERED, AND MAY NEVER SEE IT AGAIN. I'M REALLY P%#&ED OFF."
5,Very Manly Scent,"Compared to ""regular"" Aramis, which I find to be very ""citrusy"", ""Devin"" is very dark and brooding, reminding me of wood, leather and pipe tobacco.I like the scent, it stays with me and my wife doesn't disapprove. I find many scents to be too floral or too bright in character. This one suits me well. YMMV."
1,Save your money...,"While the content should have some value, the cost to the reader to extract the information is so high that the author should pay the reader to read his book. In the first 25 pages of ""At Home in the Universe"", Stuart Kauffman sucessfully introduces more than Stacey stumbled over in 282 pages. If it's an organizational perspective you want, buy Margaret Wheatley's stuff."
1,The Fountainhead,"I read this book because Paul Ryan (Rep. VP candidate )gives this book to all his staff members. The book is garbage filled with the most detestable people in American literature. While the theme of ""free markets"" and laizzze faire economics"" is the credo that all behaviour in a persons own interest is acceptable and should be free from societal interference, the characters are so flawed it is hard to be sympathetic, even if one beleives in the premise. The book is a ""pudding"", a ""tome"" that no one should be subjected to even if required reading because of academic requirements. I have also purchased ""Atlas Shrugged"" which I do not intend to read unless forced to or am paid to do it. Since neither is likely the book will simply be part of my Kindle archive."
3,Read Atlas Shrugged instead,"I read this book after completing Atlas Shrugged. I started the Fountainhead keeping in mind that since it was written earlier in Ayn Rand's career than Atlas that it probably was going to be less refined, and perhaps less articulate in its philosophies. I was correct. Atlas Shrugged in my opinion is brilliant, and it has assumed a position on the top of my favorite books list. However, Fountainhead i felt was rather boring in comparison, and far less powerful. None of the characters possessed any real charisma that made characters in Atlas Shrugged such as Francisco D'anconia and Hank Rearden so memorable. Fountainhead also lacks any truly poignant scenes, resulting in a mesh of seemingly meaningless events making up the story. Roark's speech at the end in the court case is the only moment that is comparable to the radiant brilliance of Atlas Shrugged, and for the most part is the only piece worth re-reading in the book."
4,Life changing,Loved most of this book. There were preachy-philosophical moments but overall it was an everyman-type book. Highly recommend reading Ayn Rand. Felt like my eyes were opened to new aspects of humanity.
5,Ayn Rand is a Rockstar,"I think the title of this review says everything that needs to be said. Except maybe also, that if you havent read this book, you definitely need to."
5,AN EXTREMLY THOUGHT PROVOKING BOOK!,The Fountainhead is certainly an extremely well written book. As I read the book I found it very mind stimulating and the way the story is witten intergrates a killer story with objectivist philosophic views. As I have read this book does better each year as far as sales go and I think because the way this story is presented it will continue to do better and better as time goes by. If you are looking for a story that will change the way you look at the world and think I would totally recommend this to you. I plan to read this book many more times in the future because I believe I will get more and more out of it.Howard Roark is truly an insperational character and I hope I can emulate this person as I get older and never become an evil man like Elsworth Toohey. Roarks triumph should be an inspiration for all of us and I hope those who will read and those who continue to read this book will feel (exuse me think) as I do.
3,"Barmy, preposterous, and surprisingly enjoyable","A surprisingly easy read for 700-odd pages, and a surprisingly easy read considering Rand's unique mixture of sexual and philosophical babble. This book is of course the manifesto for ultimate license of the 'artist',love song to the ego of the superman etc etc. so there isn't so much dialogue as rhetoric throughout. Plenty feisty ladies dislike Dominique (""I wish I'd never seen your skyscraper!"") Francon's rape scene, but it doesn't bother me because the overall mood is, well, camp.The themes are uncomfortably neo-Nietzchean and right-wing for me, but I like the work of Lloyd Wright and Rand basically took him as inspiration. This preposterous novel is required reading nonetheless.* Check out the wonderful dramatic & oversexy 1940s movie version with Gary Cooper in it and phallic imagery the likes of which has never been seen since."
5,A triumphant philosophical manifesto,"In this 1942 novel, Ayn Rand established the basic tenetsof her philosphy of Objectivism, with the creation of her --""ideal'-- man, Howard Roark. Loosely based on Frank Lloyd Wright,Howard Roark represents the idea of the individual againstthe collective. Ayn Rand grew up during the time of theRussian Revolution and built her philosophy accordingly"
1,Narcissism at its finest.,"Narcissism at its finest. What a self-centered douche bag Roarke is. Were he alive today, he would obviously be an uber-hipster. Yes Keating is a prostitute willing to sell his soul and anything else to achieve his goals. But there is a balance between these two people. Rand makes out Roarke as this lofty human that is unwilling to sacrifice himself for anything or anyone. Were all people like him, this would truly be a cold and uncaring world.Rand may be a great writer. Read this if you want to explore other philosophies. Otherwise the story is bleak, dark, dreary and uninteresting."
1,Blech,"Yup, I still can't stand Ayn Rand. I thought that I had, perhaps, missed something when I read this as a teenager...not so. Her characters are one dimensional and all behave ( hero or villain) in superlative. Sexist, classist, simplistic and repetitious. I tried...I still couldn't finish. Blech."
2,a naive and weak book,"Ayn Rand was so immersed in her heartless, simplistic ideology to take the time to create interesting, human characters. Instead, we have dummies inflated with rhetoric and ideas. I would hate to be in the room with one of these people for more than a few minutes -- some would bore me to tears, others would make me get violent. The plot of this novel is pretty weak, too.Rand's philosophy is very easy to understand, and as a consequence this ``philosophical novel'' is very easy to read. For readers ready for novels with human *and* philosophical content (and better philosophical content at that), I advise reading Iris Murdoch."
2,AS LITERATURE,"If one reads the commentaries recorded by RASHI on the Bible book ""Song of Songs"" the description, lovely, by the man of his beloved's breastsis annotated as meaning Moses and Aaron.The author of Fountainhead has the quality of the commentary--taking the life out of the wonderous. She does this by preaching and by horrid writing. As literature, ""The Fountainhead"" is horrid."
1,Is this a review board or a bulletin board?,"What on earth is the ""review"" headed ""message for all ayn rand lovers:lets meet guys"" doing on this board? Are Ayn Rand fans such social misfits that they can't make friends with live people? Are they just so illiterate that they can't read Amazon's review guidelines? Or are they just so sociopathic that they think they don't have to *follow* those rules?This let's-get-together message not only doesn't belong on this board, the fact that it's posted here says something about Rand-lovers that the poster probably didn't intend.I wonder if Howard Roark would have done such a thing."
5,one can't rate this book with just 1-5 stars......,"even as i write this, i know that it goes against the whole objective of this book (so to speak). all i can say is that in my life, ever since reading this book many years ago, i have had one wish....to live in a building that Roark built...in only that way could i totally experience and possess him....the mind of Roark, living within the creation of his hands. and, finally, my being could be celebrated in something worthy. museindenver@yahoo.com"
1,The worst book I've ever read,"My God in heaven I wish I'd never read this book. I could stand Anthem, but this was just a load of dogmatic garbage. I don't care if some of you think I'm purile or something for not liking this, it's my opinion you peckerheads."
5,Independence vs. Dependence,"The Fountainhead novel compares and contrasts the states of psychological independence and dependence. To a large extent, the main characters of the story represent various shades and degrees of these two abstractions. Published in 1943, the book was conceived, written and is set principally in the New York City of the ""Roaring Twenties"" and the economically-depressed 1930s--a.k.a. the ""Red Decade."" This was during the rise of the totalitarian dictorships of Nazism, Fascism, and Soviet Communism.Beyond the fact that the book is a work of art, both in 'functional form' and in substance, these historical facts alone will keep Ayn Rand's novels, and especially The Fountainhead, high on the list of ""must reads"" today, and for a long time to come. That is, unless or until the ""intelligentsia"" succeeds in finally and fully discrediting both the author and her writings.That is doubtful."
5,Excellent Read,"Ayn Rand's work, though written in the 1940's, encourages one to compare that decade with today. The ethics and morals of ""man"" still exist, but we have to look more deeply in today's world for them."
5,LA ASSIGNMENT,I chose this book to do for school and it's a great book! The language and the use is so vivid. Not too hard to read.
1,materialistic psychosis,"what randroids don't like to admit is that there's a reason the fountainhead was rejected by twelve publishers. it is in your rational self-interest not to read rand's one-dimensional, strawman-loaded objectivist diarrhea."
1,Are you kidding me!,"Somehow I had never read any of Ayn Rand's work before and decided that I should probably make a start as I had heard a lot about her from my friends when I was a school girl about 15 years ago. I thought I enjoyed the book in the first few chapters and then as I progressed the characters started to seem a little too juvenile. But what blew me off was the ending! So enduring the rest of the book I decided to stick it out until the end only to be betrayed by the author.Common you have got to be kidding me with an ending like that! Ridiculous, beats me as to why this is such a popular book. I have read a lot bad books but none enraged me like this one.Juvenile characters, silly plot, bad writing..... in my opinion this book would serve as a good tutorial on 'how not to write a book', albeit a very lengthy one!"
2,teeny tiny print,"I have no qualms with the content of the book. That said, I have had Lasik Surgery and have 20/20 vision (actually, a little better) and I cannot read this edition for more than 10 minutes. The print is tiny. I mean *tiny*. I may have to buy another edition. Cheers!"
2,For little minds... and hard heads,"I gave Ayn 2 stars just for the amazing amount of words devoted to this tripe. After being bashed on the head for (it seems like) a bazillion pages of objectivist ideology, I must say ""OK Alice (her real name), I get your point"", but after I read a couple of pages more... I'm bashed about the head again with the same ideals... then again... and again... and again. The story is boring, the prose is uninteresting, the story insulting (especially to women), and the philosophy is wanting. I rather thought it was like treking through mud with rubber boots. Does anyone over the age of 18 find this interesting? Don't try and tell me that this is good writing. And as someone who loves books... her inability to write is her greatest flaw."
1,A Waste of Time,The novel takes place in unbelievable societies that their laws of physics and theorems of mathematics must be different. It is quite sick.
1,Shocking Disgrace!,"This novel is clearly a classic as well as a novel of ideas. Therefore, it astonishes me that it keeps being reprinted with missing text and typos. How can this be? I advise everyone to look for earlier editions of this novel. Ayn Rand deserves at least that much respect."
3,Rand's an enemy of the environment!,"The book was thought-provoking, to say the least and I agreed with much of it. Maybe even most of it. However, Rand had no respect at all for the environment or for anything at all that might stand in the way of 'progress.' The 'good guys' were all cold fish, except, apparently, in bed. Speaking of which, I could not suspend my disbelief enough to accept that Howard Rourke would be anything but dismal in the sack. Good thing Dominique was open to a good rape scenario."
5,Highly recommended !,"I LIVE to read great novels, but of the ten or so novels I've read in recent weeks, only ""The Triumph and the Glory"" has the potential to become a classic. So, disappointed in most of what is being published today, I've decided to read again some of the true classics of our time beginning with The Fountainhead. Rourke is one of the truly memorable protagonists of our time, and I am rediscovering the magnificent talent of Ayn Rand. READ THIS BOOK !"
2,Inhuman,"Novels are about stories, right? Characters, emotions, real people, right? No one ever told Ayn Rand"
5,Great Story!,Saw the Fountainhead movie on TMC and just had to have the book to give to my Grandchild who is studying Architecture at Univ. of Florida.
4,"A bit trite, but still thought provoking","While Ayn Rand has written a rather predicatble storyline, it is remarkable how she shifts the readers feelings towards the characters from one extremity to the other, and how the main characters in her book always seem to ""play both sides against the middle"" with respect to their views on the hero.It is a fascinating book, and well worth the 9 bucks. I enjoyed it a great deal."
1,"""oh god, it's worse than I thought"", i thought holding a gun","""oh god it's worse than I thought"", I thought holding a gun to my own head."
3,the truth,"c'mon, people. the fountainhead is only about two things : sex and architecture. if you think you read any more into it, you need to set the book down and go play ball."
4,a lot of problems,"Certainly this is a powerful and, obviously, an enduring book. It is a gigantic, massive moreso treatease than novel. Every single page is drenched in Rand's philosophy and, after a while you are tempted to go find her grave, dig her up and rattle her crumbling bones and scream almighty high that hey! I get it it! OK? OK? I understand your goddamn point now could you please get on with it or stop passing off your fifty page novella as a 700-page plus work of fiction and please please please just allow something to happen more frequently than once every fifty or sixty pages? Also, one reviewer made a comment that I found rather amusing. Just think about what they said. Something to the effect that this book changed their life and taught them how to think, told them how to think and not to buy into what anyone else says. A wonderful moral, but let's count how many of these reviews spout literal gospel of Rand's philosophies."
5,This book is about life.,"This book changed my life, I don't think the same way I did, I don't see things like I did before. I thought I was happy, I thought it was a good life. This book changed it all. I've learned to say I, this is how I changed. I gave nine because I'm currently reading Atlas Shrugged and I seems even better."
3,"Worth reading, if only for the content and not the story.","I enjoyed the first 2/3 of the novel until the long winded propaganda selling Rand's brand of philosophy began to wear thin. I forced myself through the last 1/3 and decided it wasn't so great a story, but it was a thoughtful experience.Ayn Rand did accomplish what she set out to do: she changed the way I, as reader, look at life (at least for a week or so). To look at it simply as a piece of fiction, to me it failed. I didn't buy the ending, either.One thing that amused me is that Rand's favorite word must have been ""insolent."" It appeared at least once every two pages, sometimes once per page, sometimes twice, and once she used it twice in a single paragraph. It pulled my attention away from the story and to the words, which is not a good thing to do. Rand probably wouldn't have appreciated me laughing at her masterpiece like it was a Monty Python sketch.Here's a writer who's work screams ""I need a Thesaurus!"""
1,thanks,"This was the first novel about an architect's life I've found, so I'm giving it a rating of ""1"", hoping to find many more excellent books in the genre. I did enjoy The Fountainhead. It's a good book. The neat story line was easy to follow, and the 700 pages of simplified philosophy about life of human being as a creator gave me long-lasting relief from reality. I recommend this novel to any artists/designers out there, who are seeking the most basic form of inspiration."
4,"Awesome story, but a little naieve.","Probably spelled that wrong. Anyway, it is a great story. So many people around today that remind me of James Taggert. Heck, look at the Dem's and most Rep's. Anyway, I felt kinda sorry for Ayn. She was so close. She must of missed the parts in the Bible that stress a strong work ethic. Like if you don't work you don't eat. Being responsible for yourself, and if you lived your whole life refusing to ever lift a finger to help someone, well then, not even John Galt would of been successful at that. Look at the ones he helped. The ones he saved. Reminds of some other story that Ayn refused to believe. Her choice of course, and remember, we do live in a country where choice is just a little important.Would be awesome though to see someone stand and say some of the things the heroes in the story said."
1,"Worthless, philosophically unsound","This book is philosophically unsound, both in its arguments and in its source.Just as an example: Ayn Rand has the excellent suggestion that a building's style should be determined by its materials, and both should be determined by its purpose and its location.But if that is so, how can she think of building a temple for the human spirit out of stone (one of the central themes of the book)?What human spirit would be content in stone? What human spirit does not desire to create, to modify, to move? As such, the only proper temple can be living flesh and blood. Yet one of her central themes does seem to be that noble human spirits are best enshrined in steel and stone.She didn't carry her philosophy all the way through.This problem is repeated time and again. Thus, to those who find philosophical soundness to be important, I would advise them to go elsewhere. Even Atlas Shrugged is better on that scale."
5,Best Book Ever,You will love this book. It is a hard long read but worth it and never gets boring. The characters are great and really raises questions.
3,One long Harangue,"Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is verbose and preachy. It is obvious that this novel is her attempt to convert people to her philosophy. Essentially what you have are long speeches by main characters, which is merely her vehicle to push her systematic view of the world. I've never heard of her philosophy before but after 700+ pages of her beating me over my head with it I don't think I'll forget about objectivism.I doubt that would I ever read another book by her, even though it was a relatively fast read."
2,Strawman Philosophy,"From the first fifty pages of the book, it becomes obvious both what Rand's politics (regardless what you may think about them) and how she will promote them. Specifically with obsurd liberal/leftist sterotypes that allow her to push over. From the professor at the books start who promotes the absolute perfection of the ""classics"", to a ""liberal"" populus who aparently accepts no deviation from the status quo, this book is an exercise in strawman politics."
1,Not really,"As much as Ayn Rand is praised for her insight, I found this, as well as Atlas Shrugged, to be predictable and pat. Rand's use of language is nothing special (even simplistic) and her philosophy seems dogmatic and out-of-date. In the cold war society in which this work was first published, it may have held some relevance, but, in the 21st century, it seems dated and glib."
1,I HATED this book!,"I am a relatively tolerant person. I can read a book I disagree with and live. But this book was impossable. I threw it in the trash can halfway through. I don't have a problem with her characters, necissarily, but the way in which she portrayed the less perfect and heroic characters infuriated me. Those people are you and I, keep in mind. There is no Howard Roark; none of us can carry on a relationship with another person without speaking or contain the meaining of life in our art. It's jsut not possable. So if you want to read about how inferior and unaware you are, go right ahead and indulge yourself."
4,"Good, but get the audio book",The plot is much more compelling when read aloud by a chorus of seventeen chickens. (Be sure you get the right version.)
5,To read the Fountainhead is to Ascend as a Thinker.,"One of the most amazing particularities this book has to offer, is the way Ayn Rand combines the characters as she would ingredients to create a recipe. When the egotist of Howard Roark is intermixed with the altruist of Peter Keating, the product attained from the mixture is amazingly singular; just as it is when she clashes Dominique with Peter, or Elseworth Toher with Howard. This amazing contrast created permits the reader to understand the benefits from selfishness and to rue the altruistic. The novel is also painfully long to finish, which is how it has to be: to defend and to be an integer with self is an arduous task, not because of what one feels for self, but because the masses will hate you for being singular and integrated--you shine upon their mediocrity. This book is a must-read for every soul who wishes to ascend as a thinker--whether if you like it or not, never leave a book from Ayn Rand unfinished!"
3,new to me,"This is the first Ayn Rand that I have read. I was exhausted by Dominque in that she could have been happy if she had allowed herself to be. All of the other characters were miserable..except for Roark, the brilliant artist who lived his life objectively. I appreciate Rand's lesson about being objective which she taught very well in Roark's character. I found Ellsworth Toohey and Gail Wynand's lives rather boring. All in all I enjoyed this but the Toohey nonsense about getting drunk with his drama junkies could have cut out about 100 pages that wasted valuable time."
3,Passion,"I would definately recommend this novel to anyone. It speaks of truth and independance, and passion for life. It depicts, in Rands words, ""man as he could and ought to be."" Anyone who adheres to the pronciples of personal autonomy and responsibility, should read this book. It is an encouragement, and it changed my view of the world around me."
2,A piece of dull writing that has aged poorly.,"As someone that enjoyed the movie long before I read the book, I am now deeply disappointed. I read the Fountainhead after trying to read her philosophical book on Objectivism. Finding that text much too dry in style and content, I thought a novel would be a better first Ayn Rand book. The Fountainhead is extremely dull and boring at points with only brief stretches of interesting writing or thought. Developing and presenting her ideas should be done in far fewer pages. Fewer pages would make the lack of character development, lack of rationality and lack of realism of thought much less noticeable. In summary, a high school level philosophy with equally unrealistic love stories."
2,Not worth all the blind love it's received.,"The first time I read this book I loved it. It fed all the soap-opera ideals I had about myself and the individual, and I romanticized the comments someone else had told me about it. I bought it again a few years later, and couldn't finish it. The philosophy is obvious and self-serving, and the ""trial"" of the last few chapters was a simple way for the author to make sure even the most idiotic readers got her point. Blech.At the same time, it's important that you read this book and formulate your own judgment of it. Just don't accept it without question, which is what everyone seems to do. There are some serious flaws to the philosophy that's represented."
2,"Does it Take a Book this Long, Ayn?","Understanding that Ayn Rand lived under Communism, I canaccept her radicalism. I would not, however, encourage anybody else towallow, or, perhaps more appropriately, exult in it.Perhaps the philosophical ideas presented in the work have some merit, but Rand's style makes this book into a literary atrocity. Rand takes seven hundred pages to build one theme, and to build it to lengths that might just drive a reader to insanity.It's a simple enough story; you have a hero, Howard Roark, the architect-genius who is, at his core, an artist who will not betray his artistic and individualistic credos (how swell), his romantic counterpart, a thin, knife-like woman (Rand sparing no time on subtlty) who, concurrently, seems to love Howard and want to destroy him. In the background revolve several characters who are, to varying degrees, sucked into evil through conformity. Not too bad. The problem? This book hits you like a hammer on the head."
2,Bizarre,"Often, when an author has a thinly veiled political agenda--no matter what it is--the story suffers for it. While this book isn't as cringe-worthy as Atlas Shrugged, still, there were many parts of it that were downright strange, you could even say lurid. First of all, the author's contempt for the human race practically sizzles off each page. Secondly, Howard Roark is nothing less than a sociopath. Thirdly, that whole rape scene and its meaning was just nasty on many levels. There are elegant moments in this book, certainly, but for the most part it's just a creepy product of a rather disturbed mind."
2,Repetitive and lacking in imagination,"I knew Ayn Rand first as the founder of Objectivism and later as a novelist. I think her capacity as the latter leaves a lot to be desired. Repetitively used is the ""tell-me"" (v.s. ""show-me"") style of narrative: lacking in imaginative language both in the descriptive and intellectual context.It becomes obvious early on what the message is: ""individuality is great, blind conformity, not so great"". It becomes more and more obvious in the next 20 times the point is iterated, to the point of tiring. Objectivism aside, I feel there could have been more eloquent,subtle and ultimately effective ways to write a novel as a work of (intellectual) fiction. As a reader, I didn't care much for the characters, and that's a Bad Thing(TM) in my judging of books."
2,"Boring, overemotional",Reading this book was the awful. The characters are overemotional and the book is too long. I wish I would of not purchased this. dont believe the hype with ayn rand.
4,An excellent read,This book is a classic and tho may have been required reading in an old college literature class is better reading as anadult 40 years later
3,Well...,"Sorry, this book didn't change my life. But I did find the story very interesting. I recommend this book only if you have a lot of free time."
5,More than art or architecture.,"This novel is not a commentary upon society and the community. Rather, it serves as a means of disection by which we slowly peel away each layer of that very same society and community. In a sense, with each page, we slowly disect ourselves. With the sharpest of blades, the novel slowly slices away each layer, until we reveal the tender regions of what we trust, beleive and rely upon. This is why one can both praise (as helthgiving), or hate (as painful), and why many miss the point or refuse to see it(as one does when a serious matter involving their health arises.) Ayn Rand's skill with the knife makes her cuts almost undetectable. And that is the same reason why her novel is so wonderful and so cruel. She simply choses to cloak the instrument in the finer aspects of humanity so as to lessen the pain. For Ayn Rand, Art and Architecture are the novicaine of our culture and thereby a means to an end."
3,Treekilling,"There was a solid 300 pages of good story here; it's a shame Rand traded emotion, believability and fun for irrational philosophy"
5,A must for anyone who is interested in improving!,"I am sad to see some comments that this book is too long, and/or that the key points can be said more concisely. Often, good books require the reader to take the time to understand and absorb the meanings. The beauty of it is that you learn more as you mature in life. I have personally changed my views in reading the works of Ayn Rand over time. If human nature was easy to change, then books like ""10 things to improve your self-esteem"" need only be 10 lines long. But humans as humans tend to stay fixed within their comfort-zones, and believe me, there is so much more that you can get from reading this book!"
3,"Good, but will drive you nuts","The Fountainhead is a good book. However, Ayn Rand goes way in too depth about what she is talking about. This book is really confusing due the fact that what she really wants to talk about, her philosophy of Objectivism, is buried so deep that you have to read it over and over again. On the other hand, she does really develop one good character. Howard Roark is someone who everyone would want to be, someone who realizes what he stands for and will not yield under any pressure. Even when he's in court, or when he is about to be put out of his apartment, Roark will not change his views. As a customer, you will either take what he gives you or he will leave. Even if its one minor detail, Roark will not let you change his work. It puts him apart from everyone else in the book, and he is the reason why this book is as good as it is. Unfortunatly, he is not enough, as Ayn Rand could not really do much with the others around Howard, and the book became slow and boring."
4,"Read ""The Virtue of Selfishness"" Instead","Rand has a few great ideas about the course of history being influenced by great men and women. I happen to believe this is correct. 95% of the population add little to the advance of humankind. In the workforce I have seen key people out perform ten coworkers.What I have not seen is a woman who prefers rape as Dominique does or a capitalist too good to compromise to make a profit (Roark). Rands' hate of the little people, ""the second handers"", and their miserable little lives and her avoidance of empathy, humor and even children makes her a misanthrope of the first order.The "" Virtue of Selfishnes "" by Rand is a much cleaner and shorter approach to understanding her core belief that when we act in our own self interest its better for the individual and society."
3,One word. HEAVY,"This is not one of the pleasurable holiday reads.This book is the following:1) Profound and Thought Provoking2) Astoundingly relevant to Modern Day life since this was written in the 60's.3) Seems like a psychology Lesson4) Characters are very deep and intriguing.5) Sometimes you find yourself losing track of the chain of thought of the characters and being confusedWhy did I pick this book up? - Its a classic. And if you call yourself a reader, you have got to have read THE FOUNTAINHEAD.Would I recommend it? - Umm.. I'm not so sure."
5,Wonderful,"I started reading this book because I had nothing else to read, but once I started I could not put this book down. I absolutely LOVED this book!!!!! I am now going to purchase Anthem and Atlas Shrugged I hope they are as good as this book."
5,Great Story with lots of twists,If you liked Atlas Shrugged you will love the Fountainhead! Her character interactions are very different but for me that kept it interesting I never knew where the story line was going to go. Very fast paced and exciting!
5,Attractive Book,"At first sight, i never thought I would like this book or read it like i'm in that world; but, i did. I was in and did not want to come out, for reasons i, myself, can't explain. it's a great book of mysterious power to suck the readers into the vacuum of its world."
4,No redemption,I had been curious about this book in particular and Ms. Rand's philosophy in general.Every character in this book is reprehensible.Not one major character has the slightest in redeeming values or value.No major character is noble in any sense of the word.The book is interesting and worth the time but if you are looking here for answers keep looking.PSThe stilted 30's dialogue is laughable and ludicrous unless you keep in mind the context.
5,"Great, although long, novel","This is one of the best novels I think I have ever read because of the presentation of a gripping story with an intellectual and philosophical undertone.... this is a wonderful book that strikes upon some of the most significant morals or belief systems in American and developed society - capitalism, altruism, cronyism, independent versus collective thought and action, and much more. It is a great read!"
4,To Manners,As a 'Do-er' you should not care what Howard Roark or anyone else for that matter would do.
5,One of my favorites,"It`s a wonderful story with unforgettable characters.Howard Roark`s struggle against conformity,his unrelenting passion and ideals are a breath of fresh air even after 56 years. Read this book and be moved!"
1,TORTURE!,"This book was torture! (Or was that the idea of it!??!) Based on recommendations from friends and colleagues I decided to read this book. I knew by pg 65 it wasn't for me, but I continued to read it hoping there would be a miraculous plot twist that would suddenly turn the story around. That didn't happen. It was a predictable story about a group of pathetic self-centered individuals who were constantly back-stabbing each other.The only likeable character in the entire novel was Gail Wynand. And I don't know if he was actually likeable or I was desperate for something new by that point.Was the novel really 400 pages? It felt like 4,000!"
2,Roarks rejections,"I feel that in this book Roark had many rejections, but he stood strong on his beliefs."
1,"We're all with the stupid (she said it, not me!)","The most painful thing about Objectivism is how its most vocal defenders are, by Rand's own definition, the stupid members of the stupid masses. (If you are an Objectivist and you're a friggin' genius, raise your hand). This is particularly clear in The Fountainhead, where Rand hammers again and again ""you're stupid, Roark is a genius"" and that seems to please some people, perhaps with hidden SM tendences. Even worse, Rand made her fortune out of book sales in the six figures, and I wonder how many of the poor fools who read it fit Rand's definition of a worthy man. In case you're planning to buy it, the book is about an architect who blows a housing project for the poor because, er, he does not like the facade ornaments. (Yes, that's why, no matter how many Objectivist muck you pour into it). And guess what? The thesis of the darn book is that he has all the right to do that, because he's a darn genius. Oh well."
2,Outdated and Disappointing !,"I am halfway through reading The Fountainhead and will probably stop reading it since I am so disappointed.Given Rand's popularity, I was somehow expecting to step into an unexplored intellectual territory but I was mistaken. So far, The Fountainhead has been intellectually and philosophically unrewarding. The writing is not so bright either and I see no literary value in The Fountainhead."
1,A piece of solipsistic trash,"*The Fountainhead* is Scripture for Ayn Rand's cult of selfishness. Its proponents tend to be those overly frightened by and unaccepting of the prospect of an existence that is at best unpredictable and unknown--it gives false comfort in its upholding of universal ""moral"" priciples. This is the same kind of thinking that was behind the ""White Man's Burden,"" ""Manifest Destiny,"" and the eugenics movement of the 20s and 30s. ""Fascist"" is *not* an extreme epithet to tack to this piece of rubbish."
1,Average - Philosophically Moot,"This book is unnecessarily long. It is only a little interesting. No one really claims that this is great literature, but the following are claims that generally praise the book:1. It is inspiring2. It is philosophically admireableClaim 1 is subjective and possibly true for some. But claim 2 is just plain mistaken. Rand's novels are at most some type of applied philosophy in fictional form. At worst they are repeated batterings of a wild worldview. Anyway I can't recommend spending money on this. Afterall, there are tons of legitimate philosophical works out there, and most self-help books are probably more effective than this for motivating. But don't take my word for it. If you're still compelled to read this then go for it. Maybe you'll like it for some unique reason."
1,A silly book written by a very silly woman,"Not to be unkind, dear reviewers, but I find it ironic that Rynd's ""drooling masses"" appear to be the same lemmings rabidly rating her books 5 stars. I would rank this book alongside ""The Celestine Prophecy"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County"" as the one of the Three Silliest Books of the Century. Make that the Millenium."
1,Just Terrible,"This book is awful. Forget about the sub-mental ""philosophy"" that it seeks to put forward, it's just a very badly written book. It reads like a romance novel for Nazi housewives."
2,Let's Be Honest,"Ayn Rand is not a great writer.Somebody said that Faulkner's first works were ""about as good as anyone would expect."" He had a point. You cannot expect someone with no writing experience to produce great work. They must learn to do so in reference to other great writers and thinkers. Ayn Rand did not do this. She created objectivism instead. Objectivism, beyond all the words, is merely a blanket that protects people from criticism--""I don't have to listen to him because I have my own voice."" As a result, The Fountainhead comes to life as the work of a novice so thoroughly convinced in its brilliance.If you really want to know Ayn Rand, read her philosophical works. They're still a trap for cultists, but the portrayal of humanity will be less embarrassing."
2,Can't stand Ayn Rand,"Sorry to be the lone philistine. I believe there was a black hole at the center of Ayn Rands's soul and it eventually consumed her. Reading her fiction is more despair than hope, more heat than light.There are heroes and villains in good novels-there are plenty of good novels out there. Wading through this one was a joyless enterprise. Ayn ""the Supreme Being"" Rand died old and alone, still hating. Want a superb novel, one that will actually do the reader some good as well as entertain? Try a modern author with a future vision, Jerry Furland ""Transfer-the end of the beginning""."
1,Hated it!,"I think this is one of those books you either love or hate. I hated it. The characters were, simply put, miserable and pathetic. I am glad I know no such person in real life"
5,"Rand, rand, rand...","That was easily the worst 704 leaves of book I have ever read. If that passes as entertainment in this country then I must be deluded. Never have I seen such bad writing. There wasn't a laugh to be found amid insipid, corny dialogue proving yet again that what is popular is rarely the most deserving. The book is never been more than a vehicle for the author to overwrite and make silly political proncouncements. It is all the infuriating that this untalented person should make such money. Of course I'm jealous, I'd love to make millions out of nothing. Who reads this rubbish?"
1,Didactic and repetitive,"I have read this book three times and each time I am more disappointed. I really want to enjoy this novel, but, the writing is so dry, unimaginative and repetitive that I find it distracting. Yes, I get her ideas on objectivism, but do I need to be told about them 700 times? This is a bit like reading Mien Kampf in that I understand everything I need to know about the author's viewpoint in a 100 pages.Now, if the novel had beautiful prose, inspiring characters or an interesting story I might find it more enjoyable, but, the book is a didactic sledgehammer that makes me think of the worst aspects of propaganda. Maybe some people need that type of repitition to understand something. Perhaps this book should have been an essay instead of a weak attempt at a novel."
2,Disappointed,"There were 3 instances in which I'd heard about ""The Fountainhead"". I decided to purchase the 3rd time. Although the characters were well developed I found myself skipping and or skimming large portions of the book. The long conversations were not holding my interest at all and 3/4 through the book I found myself wondering what was the purpose. As far as I'm concerned, this book is seriously overrated."
4,This is an exceptional book introducing a unique philosophy,"The Fountainhead is an intriguing story about an amazing man whose individualistic ideas are unheard of. His struggles are well deserved due to his unmoving philosophy. However, I found myself sympathising with him. I recommend reading this novel because once you start you won't stop."
3,It seems like either the reader loves it or hates it???,I haven't read the book. The funny thing is the readers' comment goes extreme... Hate the book or love it... Hummm.... I better check it out in the bookstore first...
3,"Pretty Good, Not Bad.","I think that this book has a lot of information on the independence of an odd person, in a society that has a straight approach one way to life."
3,"""Overrated and adolescent in its approach to life""","This book probably appeals strongly to post-adolescents and others in the prime of life. It appealed to me strongly at the age of 19 before I encountered middle age, chronic illness, child and elder care, and so on. The Fountainhead does make a good point that dependency is not to be cultivated and admired. There is far too much dependency in able-bodied adults in our society--gold brickers on workman's comp and disability, poor performers who blame a bad childhood, and so on. However, to suggest that the 5 or 6 billion people on the planet can operate as free agents is preposterous. The book also ignores the fact that humans are necessarily dependent on others from age 0 to 18 and after age 65 or 70 for most folks. Even those in the middle age ranges need others far more than they know or care to admit. A good read for the prime of life, but not much wisdom in this one."
5,Yikes.,"Wow. Set aside the philosophical arguments. Please. Hands down, this novel was one of the best I've read. Not because of any literary prowess or commanding plot. This book really made me think. It is rare that one can sit down, for pleasure, read a book, for pleasure, and accidentally fumble upon a set of views that challenge those previously held. While The Fountainhead made me consider my ethics, it also altered them. I shall not delve into how. This is what the book is all about. This is why I give it such a high rating. Miss Rand succeeded in telling an idealistic story of the ideal man.While he may not change us fully, Howard Roark makes us look in the mirror a tad more closely."
5,Ayn Rand Said This about The Fountainhead,"This is a story of collectivism, not in politics, but in Man's soul. (REF: Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life by Michael Paxton)"
1,The worst book I've ever read,"Clumsy prose, laughable characterizations, ludicrous dialogue and offensive philosophical underpinnings--truly the most irritating, poorly written book I've ever (almost) finished reading."
5,JUST UM......READ BELOW,"ok , well i don't know where to begin really. its sooo amazing to read what everyone else has written and i find it incredibly weird that a few people who seem to detest this book , sound like THE MOST CYNICAL, PATHETIC AND MISERABLE PEOPLE, who seem to be totally unwilling to give LIFE A CHANCE ! i mean , who's asking you to love Howard Roark ( although i certainly do !) or agree with his ideologies. i believe, that to be truly happy you have to have a combination of Roark's policy and the common, accepted everyday and ""normal"" one . individualism against collectivism is wonderful but then, i think u need to pay attention to others as well. i mean, u shouldn't dismiss people out of hand for no bloody reason and just act like they don't exist. anyway , i gotto go but i'm gonna read it again (as i'm now a year older) and write another review ( not that anyone out there cares or anything but ANYWAY !) later on . cya"
1,The Power of Crazy Ideas,"Ayn Rand was not a remarkable philosppher but a rather a pathetic demagouge who lacked an education, a knowledge of history, and any well-formed, decent ideas. By all means, read this book if you are interested in the development of right wing ideas, but understand that this is not the work of a woman who knew much about what she attemptedto describe. Influenced not by reason and truth, but by absurd fascist Ubermensch philosophy, Atlas is terrifyingly devoid of clarity. That it has become a holy book of a cult movement for 40 years is a testimony to the unholy persuasive powers of the author and to the dreadful pathology of her followers."
2,After a great start I felt I was being talked down at,"I was incredibly engaged in this book when I first started it. 70 pages in I was excited about where this story was going. Around 100 pages I got this horrible feeling that the world Rand was creating was so unbelievably black and white that the book seemed to be written by a 15 year old who could use adult's words. There is no gray in this book. Every aspect of it is hardcore extreme in its stance. I never finished the book. Around page 200 I felt I was reading, 'This good, that bad'."
4,Monadnock Valley,"If I could wish one thing for everyone in the world, I would give each and every person their own Monadnock Valley. I couldn't quite put to words how this book has moved me until I got to the chapter on Howard Roark. Within the first few pages when the young man is staring down at what Roark has created I felt as if I was there. Ayn Rand writes about Roark, ""He did not know that he had given someone the courage to face a lifetime."" Aren't we all at some point in our lives searching for a reason to go on something to truly live for...? I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever struggled with trying to understand the good and evil of society. This book inspires anger and tranquility within a mere exchange of a simple dialouge."
1,Well written psychobabble,"Was raised on her stuff and even as a young person being confused in the world I could see this woman was far more confused than I was. Rape and inflicted pain on each other as lust and love? Not my idea of appropriate ways to show ""love"". Selfishness as the epitome of human existence? I disgree. Give me Gandhi please."
4,Must read for all,"Almost as entertaining as Atlas Shrugged, but all of Ayn Rand's books should be required reading for all high school students."
5,I don't have much to say,"If you are interested at all in art, creativity, individualism, the masses vs. the individual, etc., you should read this book. You would find it very intriguing. Ignore what other people have said regarding Rand's philosophy...just read the book and make your own decision. I thought it was quite interesting (and also very satisfyingly fast-paced), but now that you've read my review, you should read the book yourself. That's it, really."
3,good love story,i realy like this book it has a good love story about howard rourk and his girl freind plus it made me want to be a GREAT arcitect like howard rourk is in this book. but i have to give it three star's because howard rourk is pretty selfish he blows up some house's and once he even rape's his girl freind. my favorite caracter is peter keating who seem like a very nice man. i think the book should have been more about him and not rourk.
3,Main focus is the philosophy,"Many of the reviewers have commented on how reading this book has changed their lives. I can see that, but I can't say I fall into that category.I certainly found the book and Rand's philosophy interesting. The book is about 700 pages of character development. Personally, I think Rand could have written 400 pages and still been as effective at explaining her philosophy. Roark (the main Objective?) and the other main characters are meant to represent extremes and are therefore not particularly likable. The story moves quickly and has some interesting, unexpected twists.Overall, I recommend reading this book. I wasn't stunned by the philosophy but it's worth the read."
4,Freeing the mind,"I would give this book 5 stars if I hadn't read Atlas Shrugged already. While at least one review calls Rand's philosophy simplistic, living the philosophy gives the lie to his assertion that it is undesirable. Rand's writings have given me a clarity of thought I heretofore had been denied. Her philosophy was a part of my life before I found her books, but I was under the impression that I was wrestling with Satan with my thoughts. Instead, I discovered that I was trying to deny my own existence by believing what I was taught. Rand helped give me the words to fight the battle for my Self. Do yourself a favor, read her books, and open yourself to existence."
1,"Poorly Written, Obvious Plot","This is a typical Ayn Rand novel. If you are part of the school of Objectivism, take a second to read back through this book. I find it ironic that the woman who started an ""intellectual"" movement can write in such an obvious (and poor) manner. With no subtlety in style and little suprises to the plot, this novel truly reflects the shallow depths of American intellectualism. I'm baffled at it's long standing popularity."
3,How close was Rand close to truth?,"as a 21 year old,i really found the book inspiring..it's a book which makes u question urself..ur value system..it's a book which inspires u to be ""perfect"" but the caution is Rand's definition of ""perfect"" need not be perfect yes intelligence & competence is of prime importance but these values need not make u arrogant & unemotional...how can emotions be a sign of ""weakness""..it's a sign of being human & being real..In contemporary times, Rand's book probably loses a little relevance..today we have come to respect the Knowledge industry & we have acknowledged it as the third wave of revolution..so we can be assured that the Howard Roarks of this world will get their due respect, u no more have to feel guity about being competent.. Rand's book gives u a lot of food for thought but she leaves u in maze..she breaks ur world (the way u see it) but leaves u on ur own to pick up pieces & make sense out of it.. It's a very good cerebral read."
4,It's straightforward and now I'm mixed.,"Even though this is an extremely long book, it is one that calls to attention a myriad aspects lost to man. As a whole, I agree with Rand's labeling of most of the world as second-handers. Her views on women seems distorted, but her clearness on the exaltation of man, logic, and reason above the inconstancy of emotion is quite revealing and honest. The fact that her book has a happy ending is really refreshing and rare. It has opened my eyes and blurred my vision at the same time. I don't agree with all she says, which is monumental, but she makes a good case. If you are into new views, I'd take a week to read The Fountainhead"
5,The colors of The Fountainhead.,"Have you ever experienced going outside at 4:00 amto look at the morning stars and at the sunrise?The feeling given to me by that moment was one of totality (of self). It changed my life because I did it for me, because I wanted to experience it.If you have ever written a song, written a poem or done anything just for you and enjoyed it, then you have felt the essence of this book."
2,Couldn't finish it,"Toohey gets shot at, and tells the press that of course he's not pressing charges and that he wishes they'd just let the shooter go? What kind of nonsense is that? It's ridiculous!!!"
5,one of the best books i have ever read.,"its not a matter of style, or how rand writes her stories through and through again, its just the emotion. when you read this book you feel like you are a part of it.rand is definately a timeless artist, a writer with untouchable skill."
3,A pulprit to preach a sermon,"A good book, although it's very much like Atlas Shrugged--I think I like Atlas better. Howard and Dominique are both cold and indifferent to everyone and everything but each other. The end is not at all surprising. In fact, hardly anything in the book surprises me. Rand uses her books as a pulprit to preach the same sermon again and again."
4,"Read it, read it, read it","Even if you are intimidated by ""classics"" (or the size of this book), you will love this book. It's very interesting, very insightful and very modern. Pick it up. You will be glad you did."
5,excellent book,"I just finished this book today, and I was amazed the whole time.I guess it turns out that I have been somewhat of a Howard Roark all of my life, but not entirely I must admit. This book is excellently written; Ayn Rand uses many literary techniques I believed to be my own (especially in the first couple of pages)The only problems I found:-The book seemed to be a bit too long for me. I don't mean this in terms of pages, but in terms of storyline (I'm definately not afraid to read long books. One of may favorites happens to be War and Peace). I think that the book should have focussed more on Howard Roark than it did; this would have made the message of the book stronger. There were too many scenes that seemed unnecessary to me.-Toohey - -I think that his speech in Peter's room kind of ruined it for me. He reminded me too much of an insane super-villain.Other than these two things I think it was an excellent book, and offers many brilliant insights into society and morality."
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"Apparently the net.trolls are here trying to bash _The Fountainhead_. It's sad, really.The novel is excellent reading, and it gives so many interesting ideas to ponder. Some people don't like Ayn Rand's ideas...and then bash her fiction."
3,"A very interesting, but confusing book","I have to say that this book was really a challenge for me to read. When I purchased the book I didn't think that I would like it, but I said what the hell I'll give it a chance, because you never know. It turned out to be very interesting. I enjoyed the way the author used two architects to portray two different outlooks on life. In order to enjoy this book you have to go into reading it with an open mind, and if you don't then the whole point will be missed. Read it you may have a different outlook on life when you've finished. This is the type of book that really makes you think while reading it. So if your in for a challenge I recommend this book."
1,Intellectual Fascist and Homophobe,"This book, while being celebrated as a philosophy and a story, is nothing more than a lot of excess words on paper. Ayn Rand's so-called epic is a childish rant of sorts that calls to mind the selfishness of Holden Caulfield while not being nearly as compellingly written. I won't say much of the life she led and that it's odd that she is one whose ideas seem to all too frequently be adpoted.In reality, I must say that she writes a monolgue like no one else, but I cannot forgive the implications or content of a book so obviously self-involved."
1,Quite Uninteresting and Rather Pedestrian,"Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead was a ridiculous farce that didn't spare the good sense of its readership. I found her use of similie quite boorish and plebian. The author is clearly of a mindset which dictates her outrageous behavoirs. She is a product of the sub-culture which nourished her desire for world domination. It is clear that this book is a cry for help to be removed the world in which she is forced to live by a domineering husband. Ayn Rand's style of prose is detestable at best. We're all less enlightened for having to read this unimaginative, unitelligable work. Tee-Hee, hee."
1,sophmoric,"this is comic book Nietzsche. If you like this, do yourself a favor and read the source of this tributary. That it is writ by an ex-patriot Russian she male should give pause to her(?) politics, and such an hyperbolic ad hominem attack is justified due to the juvenal nature of her corpus.That this is still read should make any thinker pray for death or roused to kill. Gods! Stifle the bile climbing my throat!"
1,OMG this book threatens our very existence!,"We should totally organize a massive public bonfire and torch all of Ayn Rand's books. At the very least we should be censoring this type of literature so that impressionable teenagers don't read it and become MINIONS OF SATAN!I was one of the lucky ones who consulted a college professor before reading this. He told me that I shouldn't read it because I was especially vulnerable to its message, and that I might blindly follow it. Boy, am I glad I listened, or I might have found out the hard way.I think Rand is a total FASCIST for advocating smaller government and self-determination. I'm sure she would have felt right at home in Nazi Germany. SIEG RAND!"
1,About as Brilliant as Black Chalk,The ultimate kindergarden philosophy posing as something worthwhile. Nothing is as shallow as the written dialogue between Roarke and anyone he speaks to. Plus Ms. Rand is expecting us to idolize a rapist. What a bunch of hooey. Read anything else and you'll be smarter.
1,argh,keep me alive inside. This book is not a good lesson in how to think. If you would like to live in a democracy please say no.
1,The Fountainheadache,"It seems to me that one has to separate Objectivism from the Cult it generated. Rand DID write some very helpful things, but also some nonsense. There is a lot of evidence around that she was not a very pleasant person to be around unless you treated her like a omniscient prophet. The problem is that her legacy has been transformed into a dogma by some people who refuse to see her dark sides. I strongly urge you to read Jeff Walker's The Ayn Rand Cult. It's not a great book, but I believe his research is sound. He has read most of the literature about Rand, as well as interviewing Objectivists and ex-Objectivist that knew Rand. Then ask yourself this question: Which one is most truthful, Jeff Walker's book or the hagiography Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life? I guess reason requires you to read both before you make up your mind."
1,"Overrated, anyone?","The Fountainhead's enduring popularity remains a mystery to me. Really, this novel is a fairly standard romance with a lot of heavy-handed philosophy thrown in. Howard Roark's rugged individualist shtick isn't anything we haven't seen before in other novels. Sorry, folks, but this novel is absolutely not what it's cracked up to be."
2,"Amazing Book, but Don't Buy the Centennial Edition","This is an amazing book that you will remember forever. I read the mass market paperback version in high school and I still have it. I decided to re-read it (something I rarely do) and wanted a nice copy to keep, so I bought the hard cover ""Centennial Edition."" It's basically a mass market paperback with a stiff binding, cheap paper and tiny print. It's much smaller than a typical hard cover, no dust jacket, and overall very cheaply made.I've read several Ayn Rand books and The Fountainhead is one of my favorites of all time, but the purpose of these reviews is to rate the product that you get from Amazon. This product is poor. I definitely recommend the book, but get a different version."
4,Rand is a must for all thinking readers.,"This is not for fans of Steven King. Sorry, but I couldn't help responding to ""Brenners"" review. I found this book to be intelligent, interesting, relatively fast moving, and educational. The characters are exagerated and intense, which helps get the point of the story across. The underlying dicussion is good. Egotism vs. Altruism and the individual vs. the collective. There is good drama along the way. I don't know if you will love any of the characters, maybe Howard Roark, but you will definitey loath and maybe pity some of the others. Also, don't be afraid of the 700 plus pages. You will be done before you know it."
3,Beauty in words,"I read this book because this I could win a $10,000 scholarship. After I was done reading it, it was much more than that. I no longer care if I get the scholarship or not, this book has put into words many of the feelings I have in my heart. Howard Roark's passion for architecture is incredibly romantic, and I only wish I could be so dedicated a person like him. This book was non-stop twists and turns. It kept your eyes peeled and your mind open. I got done with the book at about 4 in the morning and had to go for a walk. I surrendered to the beauty of the book and what it represented. I would say that anyone who believes in total freedom of the mind should read this novel."
1,A Bloated Overrated Mess,"A mix of unbelievable soap opera and long-winded philosophical rants about the supremacy of the individual, this book's sole redeeming value is that the protagonist, Howard Roarke, is to some large degree modeled after Frank Lloyd Wright. When you look at it from a FLW perspective there is a bit of interest in the story. Beyond that, a bloated overrated mess."
1,clearly this book appeals to the masses,"If this book is so appealing to the masses (as it certainly seems to be) doesn't that mean the book itself is the opposite of its message?Or if you are one of the people who enjoyed this book can you stand the irony that you are the type of person she is mocking in this book?i can't tell you the number of whiny, uninteresting no-talents i have met who have recommended this book and consider it validation for why the world doesn't understand or appreciate them."
1,The Fountainhead,This book was not in the shape it was represented to be in. It was very worn and it was written in. That is not how it was described. I was very disappointed!
4,Inspiring,"I first read this book as a junior in high school, almost five years have passed and I have read it 4 times already(practically once a year). This is an excellent story if you take it from a fictional point of view and it is also filled with great political and ideological viewpoints. I find this book very inspirational."
2,its not the idea thats the problem...or the story...its both,"rand has the guts to put out a piece of propaganda under the guise of literature but i would think most intelligent readers could see through that. art and politics can certainley mix -- id have to say though, it's nice when the politics help the majority of people (benthem) or the 'art' brings forth something from your mind and senses...i gave you a chance ayn. the most i got out of this was a few 'spurts' of reason and thought...she could have been a better writer but dropping ""plot."""
4,Constructed Megalomania.,"Probably one of the best books about architecture, that doesn't have any pictures. As an architect, I am often asked if I have read The Fountainhead. I have not."
3,Extremity,"I have to say first that the book is, in its own way, revealing.But the reason I couldn't vote it a five stars is its extreme definitions of egoism and altruism. I smelled scents of resentment to communism in its debunking of altruism, which is, in this book, quite terribly distorted. Two major characters, Howard Roark and Ellsworth Toohey, are poles of two dogmatic principles. But not only so, Ellswork Toohey also soiled himself with the evil of destroying others, the effacement of independence and creation, that are, in my impression, not part of altruism. This is just not a world that one has to kill another to gain his or her independence, vice versa. But to make a world like that, Ayn Rand is sucessful in her own way."
3,"A Slow, Downward Crawl","I'm just going to say, Don't read it. It's not worth it. The first four hundred pages are fantastic; Ayn Rand describes the characters beautifully, as well as the places, their feelings, everything. The dialogue, though, gets to be a little unrealistic...But I didn't live in the thirties, how would I know? It seems, though, that during the last half of the book she just began to give up. Everything becomes glaringly obvious and a giant sermon for Objectivism, complete with lengthy monologues from the characters that span over several pages...The characters were well developed, and the story too, but it's just a slow downward crawl to the end; it was hard for me to finish."
3,Intelligent but flawed author,"Her idealogy was only valid in a time of a real or imaginedcommunist/socialist/collectivist threat. She apparently wanted tochange the world -- and extremes (masked as objective ""realities"") are so much better for herding than real political nuances."
2,Drivel that is a waste of time,"This is a good book with interesting ideas about objectivism. But, it is just too long and wordy, and the same ideas could have been expressed in half the number of pages.The storyline borders on the ridiculous and extra-ordinary coincedences throughout the book, and I had to wade through 400 pages of boring text and dialogue before the point was expressed in the end.2 stars because of the ideas in the book, but otherwise, if you have read the back page and the summary in Amazon.com, then you have gotten the idea. Skip this and spend your money on a pizza instead."
2,A 725 page rant... on selfishism,Rand's irrational philosophy is expressed (at length) in this poorly written book. Others like Emerson have expressed similar individualistic thoughts in a much more appealing and concise way.
1,Bad typesetting,"No complaints on the contents, but the typesetting in the Centennial edition (Penguin Group) is by far the worst I've encountered in a professionally published work. There's simply no excuse for such sloppy work."
1,Kindle - Where is the lower cost,"I own both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged in hardcover and paperback. Since I've recently seen the movie Atlas Shrugged - Part 1, I though it would be a good idea to download The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged on my Kindle. Well, when I saw the cost to download either book to my Kindle, I decided, no, you really don't want to download those books, not at those outrageous costs. I would really like to have these books on my kindle but I will NOT pay those ridiculous dollar amounts for the books. Well, I guess I will just pull the books off my book shelf and read them."
4,Long but well worth it,"This was a great book, excellent detail, well-developed plot, great use of characters. But 700 pages is a little extreme. I will confess, I read the whole thing, and I couldn't put it down, but if you are one of those people who can't read more than 200 pages at one sitting, don't bother. Unless you read most of this at once, you won't get the full effect of The Fountainhead."
5,One of the best books ever,"I recommend this book to anyone who can think. Many of the reviewers of this work obviously cannot. Two reviewers proclaimed putting Rand on a pedestal defeated her purpose, Rand was a strong advocate of ""hero-worship"" that is looking up to the great, not walking on them or degrading them to a lowly standard. Rand belongs on a very high pedestal, as proving that she is one of the greatest authors of the 20th century. Those who find this book as ""hypocrisy"" (as one reviewer put it), should read Atlas Shrugged. If Atlas Shrugged is too long for your small conceptual ability, read the 50 page John Galt speech it does a good job in smashing your review into pieces."
3,"Good book because of its ideas, not because of the writing","Let's start with the bad: (1) the characters are more one-dimensional than a geometric line; (2) the dialog is stilted and unnatural; (3) the plot is incredibly predictable and ridiculous in its fakeness; and (4) it's *way* too long.Now with the good: the book *is* thought-provoking. It does not apologize in its viewpoint and puts forth a good faith argument that ego makes the world go round. (Of course, it doesn't address if the world *needs* to go round, or whether ego does bring happiness, but we can read the Dalai Lama on that :)Is it a life changing book? Depends on your life and beliefs. It didn't change mine, but it certainly asked some serious questions that everyone should answer.Nevertheless, I'll probably read 20 other books before I read Atlas Shrugged.And oh yeah, I *loved* the Frank Lloyd Wright character ;^) (Sorry Ayn, wherever you are)"
4,A subjective look at objectivity,"It is difficult to brand this book as a novel.It mixes philosophy, selfishness, love and several other rarely discussed concepts. The first time I read this book I found that everything it said was perfect. But 15 days down the road the holes in the story started showing up. I started finding whole of Rand's so called objectivity a cruel farce. The story starts with the naked Roark and ends with a successful Roark who after 700 odd pages looked to be mightier and aweinspiring than ever. Toohey- the evil really went on to prove that ""the pen is mightier than the sword"". All in all the book is powerful and is not for the weaker fun loving minds."
3,Too black and white,"The Fountainhead had always been compulsory reading during our highschool years. I, however, only read it this month, 17 years after graduating from highschool. The themes of the book are well-taken, and considering the era in which they were first published, were probably considered quite revolutionary and racey. Themes of ""individualism"", ""counter-facism"", ""censorship"" and ""mind-control"" are still pertinent today and that is probably why the book still has appeal today.I felt though that such themes were presented too much in a black and white manner--with not much room for grey. The characters were either over-zealous, adamant, idealists or spineless louses. Toohey with his evangilism, Dominique with her self-sacrifices, Rourk with his inability to budge, and Keating with his manipulations. In the end--""good conquers evil"" (what a fairy-tale ending).All in all a good read and keeps you thinking."
2,kinda corny,"Actually I'm a big fan of this: I find the character of Roark very inspiring, I'll admit.But when you read it as an adult you kinda know why people say it's better to read it before you're 20. After that it's bound to strike you as a bit silly: basically 700 pages of Roark ""staring intently"" at everybody."
4,Interesting points.,"When I started reading this book, it did not feel as it if was written in the 40s (well except for some slang). This novel is definitely a though read, the author does not allow you one moment of relaxation, pumping the book full of deeper meaning. Sometimes it takes someone else to point out obvious theories about life, and what we're living for, which is ultimately what she does.But I agree with a previous reviewer that our hero was not much of a hero because he took what he wanted and didn't care about others - while other characters didn't even know what *they* themselves wanted, and were very much worried about what others would think. Ultimately, I believe that Ayn created the characters in different extremes to make a clear point about what the differences were between them."
1,Disappointed,"I seem to ""connect"" with only about 20% of the haiku that I read, but this is enough to keep me coming back for more. I do not attempt to write haiku.When I ordered this book, I was hoping to gain more understanding of haiku. However, I was disappointed. The familiar stuff (renga, the seasons, etc)is reviewed, but the discussions of the defining characteristics and the essense of good haiku are too muddled, evasive, or sophisticated for me. (I am not sure which.) Perhaps this reflects the elastic nature of english language haiku and the variety of readers and poets who are attracted to haiku.However, I do commend the appendix on Resources. This is very comprehensive and includes material in print and on-line as well as organizations of possible interest.I doubt that I will return to this book for any reason except to consult the appendix on resources."
3,Good...but not as good as his self-title debut.,"This album was Ricky Lynn Gregg's sophmore release.Although,it wasn't as good as his first album(in my opinion anyway) it still had a few good songs.Including ""After The Fire Is Gone"" which was an old Conway Twitty/Loretta Lynn cover,the two other singles from here,which are the title track and ""To Find Where I Belong"".His take on the old Merle Haggard tune,""Silver Wings"",is not bad either.Unfortunatly,the rest of the album falls flat.It just doesn't have the same feel as his first album had.I'd still recommend it though.Although,if you're gonna buy it,buy it along with his first album."
1,Never received this item.,I never received this item. I have sent at least two follow-up emails.Valerie Fox
5,Excelent performance,"This is one of my favourite lute CD's. I got this more than a decade ago and still enjoy listening to it like the first time. It is an excellent overview of Renaissance lute duets. The players' diction is clear and precise, and they produce this hollow sound which I love in the lute (not dry as many performances today). It is a pity that LAUTTEN COMPAGNEY (Apel and Katschner) does not seem to have recorded more solo CDs. Just one thing-I would have included more pieces by Heckel (his settings of popular songs and grounds are exquisite and should be make known to the public). Greetings from Costa Rica: Rómulo Vega González"
5,Something good from the French,"The French get a lot of flack from the Americans but I have to give them a hats off for this invention. Slick Silicone allows a baker to make picture perfect cookie everytime. The fact that I can bake multiple batches, without scraping or cleaning is worth its inital price after a few batches. Throw in the fact that you'll preserve your baking sheets for longer and not be spending all that money on aluminum foil and parchment paper and you wont be upset that you bought it!"
2,Nothing exciting with this mat,"Non-stick qualities are decent but not exciting. There can be uneven browning on some items, especially small ones. In addition, it gets filthy easily and oils don't clean off as easily as I would have expected."
3,Not sure anymore?????,I don't want to cause a panic but something leaches out of this product and causes a bad tastes to ie cookies. What is leaching out? I can also smell it.I have not used these mats that much ( I have 2). I have also noticed a 'sticky' substance after I have used them. I wash this off with soap.Has anyone else come across this?
3,Matfer Exopat Nonstick Baking/Roasting Sheet,This product is similar to the pampered chef silicone matt. The only difference is it is wider. It is wider than my baking sheet. I am hoping it will shrink. I do have to say even though it is a bit wide it still does the job well.
4,Just wish there were more sizes!,This is a great tool - really reduces cleaning time and the agony of cookies or other items that could stick to the pan. I've have no problems using it.
4,grate cokie sheet,i got this cokie sheet just to weaks ago d00dz and i think its grate and my famaly likes it to. grate!
4,Wish it was Dishwasher Safe,"Works great blah blah blah (refer to the other 200 some reviews); wish it dishwasher safe though. Although it may be because it can go through high temps in the oven, I didn't try it because the package says hand wash with soap. Believe me I was tempted to throw it into the dishwash a few times--but decided not to. It keeps baked goodies from sticking and does what it's supposed to do."
4,Long life genes,Highly recommend this baking sheet. It arrived in record time and we have been using it daily. I will probably wear out before it does!
1,Non stick baking sheet,"We have had it for 2 weeks, it does everything every one else says it does, BUT it fell apart. The white edging around it cracked and became brittle. Could not use it anymore, in the process of sending it back. It also discolors and is hard to clean. Non stick aluminum foil is the way to go."
1,Set off BOTH smoke alarms!,"I did some research before buying this as I have read pros and cons to the different brands. The pros for the Matfer are that it looks better (IMO), stores nicely, laid perfectly flat in the pan, and was easy to clean. I used it three times in a 350 oven with no problems. Last night I used it at 425 and it set off BOTH of my smoke detectors! NOTHING has ever set them both off...not even cleaning the stove! Here's the thing: there was no burning scent anywhere. Nada. I was so surprised when it set off the alarms and started running around trying to figure out the problem. Worse, this happened at about 8pm and I live in an apartment building. The alarms would NOT shut up. My crostada had only been in the oven a very short time, so 425 for a few minutes was enough to do it. I won't use this again in the oven...even if this seems fine at 350, the odorless chemicals that set off the alarms are not something I want to tamper with. Who knows what we are breathing in?"
1,Lost its non stick ability,"After about 5 uses cookies stuck to it just like a cookie sheet. First 5 uses they would slide right and it worked as advertised. All downhill from there. Have tried scrubbing it with dishwashing soap, letting it sit in the sink in soapy water for half and hour, cookies still stick to it."
3,Spring for a Silpat,"I have one Matfer baking sheet, and one Silpat baking sheet, and I can definitely say the Silpat is a superior product. The edges of the Matfer are already becoming frayed, and the edging is coming unsealed. It's definitely worth the extra $5 for a Silpat.Like another reviewer, I also prefer parchment paper for lining cookie sheets. The silicone can be a little sticky, and it's hard to get all of the cookie residue off sometimes. If you mainly want this for cookies it may be better to stick to parchment.However, the baking sheet is extremely good for florentines and other similar cookies or candies. I also like how it fits perfectly in my 1/4 sheet pans, instead of hanging over like the parchment does."
1,"Wow, where did I go wrong???","I used the Matfer sheet for a pizza crust but didn't have it more than 5 minutes in the approx. 400 degree oven before a horrible smell filled the apartment and the smoke alarms began shrieking. This was a brand new sheet, so there was no residual grease on this matt, as one suggested to another experiencing this problem.A few others with the problem also seem to be in an apartment, so perhaps the smell is better tolerated or not as noticeable in a larger house? Or did a bunch of us get defective sheets? Until I'd find out, I couldn't recommend this product."
2,"Weird smell, weird taste","As some other reviewers have mentioned, the sheet leaves a chemically taste and smell in your baked products -- it's nothing awful, but noticeable, and, to me, bothersome. I thought it would fade, but after a few attempts I figured my ""wear-in"" efforts weren't worth all the cookies ending up in the trash. The surface of this baking sheet was easy to wipe clean. However, the grease from the food eventually started soaking into the sheet and leaving circles of grease which I just could not wash out. At the end of the day, I don't think this is any more convenient or better than using parchment. This product is overrated."
2,Odd Taste,"The first several times I used my Exopat I was totally convinced I would never cook on parchment paper again. They were totally as described by so many reviewers, a nonstick wonder. The bottoms of cookies were perfect and uniform in color and browning. Over the two months since I have had them, a peculiar, nondistinct taste has been detected in the cookies I am baking on these sheets. It is very subtle, but nontheless, an undesired taste. I use the same cookie dough and did a nonscientific experiment and the cookies baked on parchment or plain baking sheet did not have the same peculiar flavor. Is the silicone stable??? I have decided not to bake any longer on these sheets. I will find other uses for them but they will not be used any longer for baking cookies on. I would love to know if anyone else has encountered similar problems."
3,meh,I use this only for rolling and cutting out Christmas cookies but I find it worth keeping just for that limited use
5,The best,"For those frequent bakers out there, this mat is a godsend. It's non-stick surface makes for an easy cleanup and its durability will ensure that it lasts and lasts. Well worth the price."
4,Works great!,"Last winter, I just tested a bunch of cookies recipes and ran out parchment paper really fast. This baking mat performs well. I think that it costs less than all the parchment paper you need to buy."
3,Non Stick Baking Sheet,"This product is easy to work with. Slides cookies out like charm. Cleaning is easy too. It still requires some grease to use.However, one must be careful not to crink or crimp it while storing."
5,Great Product,"Works great, nothing sticks. I made an apple pie that spilled over quite a bit while cooking, and was glad that I had the pie pan sitting on the matfer sheet on a cookie sheet. The sticky, syrupy mess slid right off the matfer sheet and made for easy clean-up."
2,Mine is already pooping out-only used it about 8 times,"Maybe I have a faulty one, but I used it to bake cookies and make a few french fries and it is starting to peel at the edges. I do not believe it will last for 3000 uses.Pretty alarming since I read from another reviewer there is fiberglass in it. If it gets worse I will throw it in the trash and unfortunately add to a landfill. Also it picks up the scent of the food (gingerbread,french fries,chocolate)and you smell that even after you wipe it down.I am sorry to say I would not recommend this product and plan on using parchment."
2,Not worth the money!!!!!,"So, I saw this Exopat mat on sale... after reading the reviews, it seemed like a great buy. I typically would use aluminum foil to bake, but figured I could save some money by using this re-usable non-stick mat. Well, turns out that it was just as sticky as aluminum foil.I baked cookies on it a few times, and the cookie smell actually got baked into the silicon. Even after washing and washing, you could see grease circles were the cookies baked.So, you are paying for a silicon mat that is a pain to wash, seems to stick more than non-stick surface, and soaks in grease. I went to IKEA and purchased a dupont non-stick cookie sheet for 4 dollars and never looked back.My EXOPAT MAT ended up in the trashcan after a week."
4,Great replacement for aluminum foil,"My brother has always struggled with getting his pizza off aluminum foil wraps when he bakes them in the oven and tore through so much foil. I finally decided to get this baking mat for him to alleviate his frustration, and thank the gods, it has become his favorite baking tool since. No more messes of torn foil in the oven anymore.However, a visible baked pattern has emerged on the mat after repeated use, in the exact shape of a pizza."
5,Matfer baking mat,"I love the baking mats. I would love more, but the person selling only had three and I gave two to my daughter. Definitely recommend the product and seller."
5,This works great!,"My wife is a hard sell on any new kitchen technology, but she uses this every night to cook my chicken.The only thing I don't like is the MADE IN FRANCE plasered in HUGE print on the sheet."
2,Are they worth it?,"While I love that my cookies don't stick to the pan, I have yet to figure out how to adjust the oven temperature and cooking time to make the cookies turn out right. I've gone back to making cookies without using my Baking Sheet.They do work great for rolling out pie dough or sugar cookies (and not so messy!)."
1,health hazard,"I am a physician and have an issue with baking anything on plastic, silicone or otherwise....we now are aware of the issue with heating in tupperware and are learning more...and you want to bake on silicone????I'll take my health over the 5 extra minutes it takes to wash a cookie sheet. Wow.Dr. Tracey Martin MDPhoenix Arizona"
2,Not sure how useful this product is,"I admit, this product is not what I expected or needed, so that may bias my review. Two main complaints - it is not very sturdy. I find it difficult to transport it to and from the oven without dropping the contents. I also noticed a chemical like smell when heated.So far, I am not very impressed."
5,Not even glue sticks to these things!,"I bought these to use in the paint and glue area of my carving studio. They work just as I had hoped. Clean up is a breeze, even the glue slides right off!"
1,a copy that isn't as good,I bought this product thinking it was as good as a Silpat. NOT!! It did not do the job! not only did it stick but it broke my cookies! UG! next time I will just buy the silpat!
2,Very disappointing,"I really thought I'd have an easy-to-clean baking surface for cookies, bread, etc. This mat was useful two or three times and then food started sticking to it and now, after I've used it about 12 times, it is dirty, impossible to clean and heading for my trash bin. The main point is that stuff does stick to it, and it is really impossible to soak and wash off. There were no instructions for cleaning or treating the mat when I got it so if I've done something wrong (I used it and wiped it clean, that's what I did) I'd like to know."
3,Why does my smoke alarm keep going off?,"I just moved into a new apartment, and bought this for all my baking needs. It was great at first! Stuff really won't stick to this guy. It was a little difficult to get the brown spots that... some common ingredient in baked goods... causes off, but in general I was happy.But every time I baked, even when nothing burned, my smoke detector would go off! At first, it was obvious to me that it was the electric oven; it was just too hot and I was used to gas.But that didn't seem right. Everyone else can bake with an electric oven and keep the smoke alarm from going off! ...It must be the baking mat. Sure enough, it was. The next time I baked frozen Pilsbury cinnamon rolls (which sent the smoke detector into a high-pitched rage last time) with nothing but aluminum foil on my cookie sheet, everything was fine. Needless to say, I am disappointed."
4,Good Product,"I really like this product, but it doesn't fit any of my baking sheets correctly. It is either a little large or a little small for what I have. Maybe I need new baking sheets! Check the size of your pans before ordering. They state that thet cannot be trimmed to fit like some of the silicon sheets, but I trimmed mine several months ago and have not suffered any ill effects from this trimming."
5,Great Product,This works great and is an excellent value. It's very nice to just have to rinse this off and clean up is done.
2,Breaks down over time,"I have owned this for two years and stopped using it once the edge started flaking off. I doubt that the chunks that were coming off are unhealthy, but I sure don't want pieces of silicone in my food. Now I use parchment paper exclusively and there is no danger of getting chunks of it in my baked goods."
5,WOW!!!,"I bought this on a Fri, used FREE Super Shipping and STILL rec'd in on MONDAY!!!It's JUST LIKE a Silpat, looks JUST LIKE it, but cheaper by far!! I just ran it through water after using and the goop just fell off!!! NOW I need NEW baking sheets!!!"
1,Not what I expected,"Everyone that I spoke with raved about this product but alas I cannot concur. I placed it under a pie that I was making to collect any spill-overs and ended up with a smoke-filled kitchen. The run off from the pie burned onto the mat and refused to come off. Also, the mat started to unravel on the edge. All of this from just one use! The mat was completely ruined and needless to say I was very disappointed with the experience."
4,Can't Bake Without It!,"I can't believe it took me so long to get one of these. So much healthier than greasing and so easy. Nothing has ever stuck.I would have given it five stars but I noticed a couple tiny pinholes after only a handful of uses. This hasn't caused any kind of problems at all, but I worry if they enlarge."
4,Really handy,"I've been using my mats for a couple years and they are wonderful. They are especially great for candy making (no more buttering aluminum foil then peeling the strips off the finished toffee). I also like them for kneading and shaping bread-I don't have to use any additional flour to keep the dough from sticking. I even use them to roll pie crust.I would like to point out that cookies do not brown very well on these mats. I really only use them for baking very sticky or tempermental cookies. But I like my butter cookies a nice golden brown on the bottom and when I bake on the mats, they brown on the top while the bottoms are still soft and pale."
