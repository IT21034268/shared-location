2,Story Great Illustrations POOR,Living in Norway I ordered this book so that my American grandchildren could enjoy the excitement and joy of this book together with their parents as a family journey through the advent season. I eagerly anticipated being a part of this daily event.What a major disappointment! This is but a shadow of the Norwegian edition's illustrations and not engaging for the children. Where was the beautiful picture of the advent poster? Where were the pages with the little windows children could peek through every day? Where were the differing kinds of pages to key them into when the story was in the past or the future?Next year I shall spend the 400 Norwegian Kroner and bring that book here so we can read the words in English and EXPERIENCE the story from the richness of the Norwegian artist's perspective.It is no wonder this book is not as enjoyable for American families as it is for the Norwegian ones.
5,The Christmas Mystery,"Our family started reading The Christmas Mystery about 5 years ago and it is now a very special Advent activity and a way to come together as a family in a busy season. While it is a bit confusing at first- the story moves backward through time and geography-it is so rich and has so many layers that it's absolutely worth reading. The first year we were just trying to grasp the rudiments of the story. Now each reading reveals new layers of meaning - nuances that I didn't get at first. I would recommend it for children 8 and older, so that it holds their interest."
3,A charming book.,"It was a rather charming and interesting book. Found it both unique and engrossing. However, not everything made sense first time."
2,Not so good,"This story just couldn't get my attention and wasn't really all that good. It was really boring, and not muych of a mystery."
5,Read as an advent calendar,A good friend recommended that I read a chapter a day with my children leading up yo Christmas. It was certainly a sweet story rich in historical references. We thoroughly enjoyed the activity!!!
3,Great concept!,"Jostein Gaarder has a fantastic concept here: a new take on an old story. Fun for kids and adults. There are, however, several annoying typographical errors throughout the book. Perhaps the publisher published the galleys instead of the edited version."
3,Burns out after first 30 Minutes,"Greetings from Tromaville!!This film is basically about a guy who gets revenge on his mistress/girlfriend who seemingly starts fires. It reveals what a 4th degree burn is (total carbonation of the skin) and clearly had an influence on such modern films as ""Fatal Attraction"" and Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"". Despite this, it is dated has loses steam after the first thirty minutes. The extras are simply the Radiation March, and an interview with the script writer.FYI: This film bombed in America, but was a blockbuster overseas with it's alternative title: ""Phantom of the Ferris Wheel"".-Chas Kangas Jr."
1,"Dry, terrible","I love the black markers by this company, but these arrived completely dried out. Amazon sent a replacement (which was great) but the new ones weren't much better. They were completely dried out within 2 weeks. Avoid."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"I have been studying servant leadership recently and was excited to read what Kennth Blanchard, author of the ""One Minute Manager"" would have to say on the topic; especially from a Christian point of view.I was hoping to find a meaty, substantial book with examples and illustrations from his extensive experience in business and leadership. Instead, ""Servant Leader"" is merely a collection of quips, quotes, and a few Bible verses.It is so disappointing when good authors market these tidbit books. Blanchard must have some wonderful insights and knowledge but this particular book is one which offers more milk than meat. The pages are beautrifully illustrated and the color graphics are very professional - it looks great on the coffee table.However, if you are looking for a fuller treatment of Servant Leadership, I recommend the recent books by James Hunter: ""The Servant"" and ""The World's Most Powerful Leadership Principle""."
3,Good book but a bit bloated.,"The messages of this book are wonderful, however my problem with the book lies in it's production. The publisher data lists this book at ~128 pages. If you were to remove all the glossy, fluffy, and otherwise do-nothing-feel-good stuff (pictures, etc.)this book would be lucky to hit 25 pages. Knowing what I know now, would I have spent the $15 in the bookstore for this book? Probably not for 20-25 pages of solid message/ideas slicky inflated and packaged. Seriously, the authors could have put alot more work into to earn my $15. If you have any doubts about my comments run down to the bookstore and leaf through this book."
4,Clear and Understandable,"Ken Blanchard is famous for making leadership easy to understand and he once again delivers in ""Servant Leader."" The anecdotes weren't as wonderful as in Shar McBee's book ""To Lead is to Empower"" but he is clear and understandable. Definitely worth reading."
1,No meat,"This book was so short they could have published it in less space for a smaller price. All the pages are like post cards, which is pretty, but makes it hard to read."
2,Book Falls Apart!,I am having a very hard time reading this book because the pages are literally falling out of it. I would expect a hardcover book to have much better quality!
2,Not enough!,"This book would make a great power point presentation, but for me it did not provide enough meat. The authors mention principles and briefly explain them, only problem is the explanations are too short."
3,Rich content poor construction,"Having never read anything by Blanchard, I found the content of this book very meaty in theory, leaving me wanting to read more of his work. The content would receive 5 stars. Unfortunately the book itself was less than desirable: the pages fell out. Therefore I had to give the total product 3 stars."
5,what you expected,The Markers were in good condition. Blue erases the best so I use it more than the other dark markers.
3,Discwasher 1500 DVD Cleaning Wipes,"After using one of the cloth wipes on a music CD, there were slight scratches on the disc from the cleaning. Regular tissues along with cleaning fluid would possibly not scratch a CD as much as these wipes."
4,Good quality for price.,"I bought these towels 1/06, just before my in-laws arrived. They made a great impression. I have washed them once. They look almost as good as new after the first washing (no pulls or pilling). I just wish they came in more colors."
2,hand towels,I thought that these towels would be of a better quality. They are thin and not too absorbant..
5,Lovely,These hand towels are very soft and pretty. I was very pleased with both their appearence and durability.
4,Muito legal! Very cool!,This 2 CD set is a great compilation of Sandy & Juniors most recent hits. It includes 30 tracks and is much like their Millemnium album. It even includes some of the same songs. I give it 4 stars because like Millennium it does come with any info in the CD jacket. No lyrics or photos of the duo.
4,Needs Practice,"I did 1 stickey base coat on the pinky and ring finger, then 2 coats of pink and super shiny. Then the other two fingers I did 1 stickey base coat, pink, then stickey base coat, pink, and super shiny. Just click the image and you can see for yourself! These 3 polishes were fun to try mind they are my very first CND's ever to own. I just love the formulas and how great they work!"
1,Made my nails peel; polish still chipped,it took layers off of my nails. it did not extend the length of my polish at all. very disappointed.
4,Good Polish!!,I love this polish. It allows for a great adherence for my other polishes!! I definitely recommend purchasing this item.
3,good but not great,It isn't so sticky... Not the best base I have bought. It dryes fast and lets me get on working in my nails...anyways not perfect but it does the job!
5,Great base coat,Great base coat!Color comes on a little green at first but when you paint over it the color disappears.There are no bubbles and it helps leave my nails chip free.I would definitely recommend this product!
2,Not miraculous and was leaking in the package,"I saw a lot of reviews saying this base coat was amazing and helped with chipping a ton. I have an office job and type a lot and fidget with my fingers a lot. I am prone to chipping and I don't think this base coat really made a difference. In addition, it was leaking in the package when I got it so a substantial amount of the bottle was a hot sticky mess in the package."
5,The English through the eyes of a Scot,"Mr. Gill is a Scot, not an Englishman, and he insists on maintaining that distinction even though he has spent most of his life among the English. His observations depend on a sharp eye and a sound historical perspective. His portrayal of the English is full of surprises and his revelations are exhilarating and profoundly funny."
2,Up to the Gills,"A book of disjointed observations on the modern condition of our country's parent isle. It would have been better left as a series of magazine essays---with some of its chapters omitted from the series.A.A. Gill writes in a style used by many of today's edgy (read: quick, terse, ironic, condescending, black-edged humorous) columnists: it is designed to immediately grab one's attention and provoke a quick laugh. But sustained over the length of a book, this style--based on the author's acrobatic use of language-- wears on a reader.If you have only time this year for one funny, well-written, and off-beat book tied to England, buy and read Alexander Waugh's Fathers and Sons."
5,"Brilliant..beautiful, funny and heartfelt","The previous reviewer should have read the book. Mr. Gill's descriptions of British War memorials are almost unfailingly admiring--and constitute some of the best writing in the book. Angry Island is both acerbic, precise and hilariously funny social commentary--and a heartfelt cry for reason. Hyperbolic, cruel--and yet true enough. It's the sympathy and humanism peeking out from inside Gill's silk-lined jacket that makes him such a great essayist, another splendidly failed idealist--like Orwell or Hunter Thompson."
2,The English In The Crosshairs,"The English have always been the targets of humorous criticism and Mr. Gill's book rightly rakes them over the coals. His extremely witty take makes for enjoyable reading even for Anglofiles. That being said,Gill doesn't know when to stop. The first half is funny , and I assume, true, but he keeps on going telling the same joke over and over again. Enough already!"
3,5 pounds of funny stuffed into a 10 pound sack,"This book disappoints. As other reviewers have noted, perhaps the author's gifts are best expressed in other formats. The various conceits upon which he constructs his tirades are not strong enough to support their size. Or, as a Brit might say, he does go on a bit. Save your $$--get it from a library and dip in to some funny moments in the 1st half of the book. It's not one you'll want to own."
5,So cute!!!,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift and really likes it. I think it is adorable and will probably order one to keep for her baby sister. Her two year old brother liked it too, but we won't talk too much about that. ;) Seems well made...no problems so far."
4,Fun for budding producers,"We purchased this camera as a Christmas gift for our 10 year old son because he was always trying to borrow our ""good"" camcorder to make movies with his friends. He absolutely loves it. We got him a 512K disk to use, because the 32MB gets used up quickly. The only thing that is missing is a light. If he takes a movie in a room that is not brightly lit, the movie comes out dark. However, most of their movies are filmed outside in daylight, so the light is not too much of an issue. Also, the software installed easily and is simple to use. I would say this is a good buy."
5,Why is it a toy?,"This product serves our purposes really well. It's only slightly larger than a normal digital camera, and takes plenty of footage with a large memory card. We wanted snippets of video to show parents our holiday snaps and this, whilst no good if you wanted to be a film producer, gives a decent picture and better sound than the video option on the stills camera. And for the price, you don't care if it accidentally gets dropped into the sea (except you lose your memories.) Great Great value!"
3,"It's ""okay"" for the price I paid.","I only paid 27.00 for this product when it was on sale here at Amazon. My 10 year old sister loves it, but the picture and video quality isn't that great. I guess it's good enough for the kids. I found thath the picture and video quality is best when there is sufficient lighting around the person being recorded. Other than that, I don't really care much for it."
1,Vidster not worth the money!,"The vidster camera had fuzzy images. Not really very good for video or taking still pictures. Had I known how awful it was, I would never have bought it. I bought it for my 10 year old neice and I gaurantee it will end up with toys she never plays with. It's a waste of money."
2,Makes an awful noise on playback,"I haven't seen anyone else say that their Vidster makes a loud ""white noise"" sound when they play back their movies. Anyone else having that problem? I'll be sending it back but not sure if this is an isolated problem."
1,Save your money!,"Save your money and landfill space full of batteries you'll use up on this product. I wish I had spent the extra money and gotten a basic ""actual"" camcorder that my child would USE rather than this toy that was old after 10 minutes. Poor picture quality, is frustrating to child or adult to try to use. What a waist of money!"
2,Not worth the money!,"I bought this toy last Christmas for my then 9 year old daughter. She loved it but was frustrated that its recording time/photo capacity is so small and the quality of the picture is sub-par. It eats batteries like crazy and inexplicably just stopped working after a few months. Much too expensive for the actual quality, especially when you can buy a real digital hand cam now for a few hundred dollars. If this toy had cost around $30.00 I would have given it a great review."
5,Perfect for all ages,"Sophisticated enough for our 8 year old, and simple enough for our 4 year old. This toy is perfect for all ages! It has been dropped several times and remains unscathed. We have three Vidsters, and all are still in perfect working order after a full year of use - what a find! We found a larger memor card a necessity, but well worth the investment. Both still photos and videos are excellent quality, and camera has features such as instant playback that make it just like an adult camera. Well worth the investment!"
1,Skip this camera,"After reading the reviews, I ordered the Vidster for my 7 year old without much research in to the product. What a mistake! The idea is great, but the reality is terrible. The memory on the camera is very, very small. He can tape only about 5 minutes max and less, of course, if he takes pictures. The original software editing disk arrived cracked. Mattel replaced it, but the second disk was inoperable as well. He used his camera off and on the entire first day and kept deleting and retaping. The batteries (4 AAs) lasted less than 24 hours. All and all, I would recommend to anyone that you skip this camera and buy a low end video camera that will coordinate with your own editing software and allow the child more taping time."
3,Okay....,"Well I got this camera for christmas and my brother got the V-cam(which is very similair to the vidster). It's pretty fun exept that when i replaced it's batteries a few days ago (cause it wasn't turning on) it stopped working. It might be that Iv'e had it for a long time but would a long time be 7 months? Anyway, the editing software is pretty good but I prefer the digital blue. (i had this a few years ago and you could put really good special effects in your videos) I had real fun with the Digital Blue but it stopped working on me for a good 9 months. (Is it me or do i just have bad luck with cameras)But the Digital blue is hard to find these days.Well hope this review was helpful."
1,Misleading! Beware!,"The actual bulb is not a vibrant yellow like it is in the picture. It looks closer in color to the orange bulb that they try to sell together. The light produced is also orangy. It is a BUG LIGHT but as you can see in the description, it does not say BUG LIGHT."
5,Video Highlights,"France `98 was one of the most thrilling and dramaticWorld Cup tournaments in the history of the event. Fromthe opening round where the free spirited Nigerians upsetthe highly acclaimed Spanish team and the durable Mexicanscame back from two goals down to tie star studded Hollandand move into the second round. Relive France`s dramaticover time goal against Paraguay, the tension as England,Italy, Argentina, and Holland fall to the fate of penalty kicks,Brazil producing their magical skills to down Chile, Denmark and Holland ontheir way to the final, Croatia crushing the aging Germans, and the passionateFrench going all the way to victory. Experience again all the memorablemoments from four weeks of thrilling soccer, the incredible skills, greatteamwork, unbelievable saves, near misses, superb attacking soccer, theheartbreak, the controversy and the thrill of victory. They are all here -all the highlights of the 1998 World Cup."
3,"Great book, average techniques.","I like the setup, organization, photos, and guidance of this book, but I felt the techniques and/or patterns were mediocre and somewhat elementary. I expected something more advanced. I am taking classes in metal/jewelry-smithing so maybe I am just past these particular techniques. Those who are just beginning might enjoy this book more."
4,creative silver chains:20 dazzling designs,this book has some very different designs and the instructions are clear and precise - i fully recommend buying it!!
1,ZZZzzzz zZZZZzzz zZZzzzz,"Boring... A story. This book isn't about Rituals, It's about ""The art of rituals"". Don't make the mistake of buying this book as a good source for learning rituals."
5,Tasty and Sensible,"Not only are the soups tasty and inventive; but they are sensible and nutritious. They require little time and ingredients that are neither exotic, nor hard to find. Most recipe books are loaded with expensive ingredients that necessitate driving 20 miles from your home, and that you use only for one particular recipe. I want recipes that use inexpensive stuff I have on hand, or will have no trouble finding. This book meets those requirements. I read cookbooks like other people read novels, and this is the best cookbook I've ever had. Now that he's conquered the soup pot, Joe needs to move on to pastas and more."
2,The Breaker Tripper Boggs Down,"This saw constantly bound up and blew the breaker on the firwst project I used it on. The project was cutting off 3 layers of asphalt shingles and a layer of 1x8 sheething on my roof. The saw did nothing but fail, even with 2 new carbide blades, they were gumming up and smoking no matter how slow I went. It was 1 or 2 feet and trip the breaker , over and over , my ... [less expensive] circular saw ... did a better job than my ... DeWalt...!"
5,As Good As Rock Gets,"Rock doesn't get any better than this. The title track should have been the campaign theme song for Clinton-Gore in 1992 -- remember the economy was bad then. Not only does it rock, but its lyrics are intelligent and pithy. ""Seeds of a Revolution"" is another great track with its beautiful, but lively melody, and fine lyrics. It's great to see that this CD is available again. Now if Columbia Records would only reissue Nile's 1990s masterpiece, ""Places I Have Never Been,"" CK 4434)you'd get to hear Nile at his most creative and entertaining."
2,"A little Havana, A lot of a writer's workshop","Cuba, as anyone who has lived in Miami can tell you, exists for thousands of exiles chiefly as a fantasy landscape colored by memory, regret and loss. Just as well, because the reality of the place in the 21st century is pretty grim, as I experienced it. But the maddening habit of exiles to romanticize the place is well displayed in ""Loving Che,"" which hardly exists outside of lyrical scraps of random thought, sensation and writerly flights of fancy. Ana Menendez puts a lot of effort into conjuring up her dreamy reveries, but spends little time making her tale remotely believable or affecting. And the frequent pauses for ""deep thoughts"" get old very quickly. It's a lot like spending an afternoon talking about Cuba with an exile: captivating at times but more often just frustrating, opaque and sad."
3,Good for Beginners and Campaign Players,"If you're just learning how to play--especially if you're working your way through the various campaigns--you'll find this book helpful. However, if you already know the mechanics of the game and are familiar with the various units, technologies, and ages, you might be disappointed should you expect to find much in the way of strategy for multiplayer games on random maps. Better than half the book is devoted to the campaigns and how to play them. The first part of the book reviews the basics of the game, with no in-depth analysis of the individual civilizations' strengths and weaknesses. Only several pages in the appendix address multiplayer strategies, and even this information is minimal. This book deserves a better, more descriptive title that would suggest it is appropriate for beginners and campaign players."
2,Yeah...useless book,"Figures. Can't believe I read the reviews and bought this book anyway. Sheesh. Like, 3 frickin pages in the whole book about multiplay and not nearly enough about advantages,disadv of each culture."
5,Excellent Resource!,"I'm a divinity student at an Ivy League school. ""Who's Who in the Bible"" is AWESOME. The bios and content are presented in a flowing, story format. There are lots of pictures and visuals to picture the people and see how they have been portrayed in the art. There's also a comprehensive listing of all of the people in the Bible, which is really helpful.This book is great for div students, but an excellent resource for churches, families, and others!"
4,really helps to understand all of the characters,"This book and the book ""Who's who and where's where in the Bible"" are a great help in understanding all of the characters and places mentioned in the bible. If you can't find it in one, you're sure to find it in the other!"
5,A Great Bible Reference Tool!,"This book covers all of the people listed in the Bible from A-Z. It also gives a pronunciation of their names which is very helpful! I bought the book for preparing lessons, but I believe anybody who just wants to study the Bible will appreciate it as well! The book is loaded with many great illustrations. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Teacher of World History,"""Who's Who in the Bible"" arrived 7 days after I ordered it. It was just what I wanted. Thank You Very Much for the quick delivery."
4,Nice shirt,"Welllll.....it's a t-shirt. Actually, the screening is well done and has held up well for several washings. No complaints."
3,Too little Dug,"I am a Dug fan. I am not a Smalljohn fan, though. The latter is okay and has some okay songs, but Dug is a genius, or at least I'm fond of his music. This album only has 4 Dug songs, and thus 6 Smalljohn songs...6 too many. It's like Husker Du, where I only want to hear Bob Mould. Dug's songs, on this album, are good, but not his best Treepeople effort (The double ep CD is the must)."
4,Great picks,This nylon pick has great play feel. It is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords.
4,standard nylon picks,"Nothing particularly special about this product. It does the job. I needed soft, medium and hard picks and this definitely satisfied the soft pics category."
3,Mediocre item,"I think the product doesn't look as appealing as I expected, but it works fine. I would say that considering the price I would expect something better, but I was not very disappointed in any sense. It's okay for a beginner pick."
2,"Derivative and off-key ""darkwave""","Let's put the inevitable, obvious (and tedious) comparisons to Depeche Mode aside for a moment. Xero/G's Are You Weightless is, pun intended, weightless. The arrangements (all synths) are standard without anything original or interesting standing out. It's utterly derivative. You've heard it all before and most of us with a mid-priced synth could come up with equally mundane stuff. But that's not what kills it for me (I usually enjoy such stuff for, at least, background to everyday life)- the vocals (female) are amateurish. As much as I hate to be harsh and insulting, this singer should keep it in the shower and/or car. She has no range, no style, and, worst of all, no ear. If you have any sense of pitch (which the singer and producer apparently have not), this music may even make you cringe a bit. In a word, and to my disappointment, this artist is BLAH."
3,"Good music, flat singing","While overall I do like this CD, it has interesting composition and beats that don't fall into the repetitive realm like some electro does and it's even very dreamy. I like the singer's attempts but I have to point our her singing is very flat at times, something I hear in many corny female sung goth music. She needs to stop singing in all of her low ranges as it's limiting the stuff she could be performing.If it wasn't for the singer's flatness, I would have given thes album 4 stars instead of 3. For those into the new type of sythy music and somehat dreamy compositions I still recommend you at try this album as it's not bad at all."
3,Not Quite Hillerman,"Ancient Ones is part of a series featuring two Indian cops. The story revolves around 14,000 year old skelton that could change the pre-history in America. The plot moves along and there are plenty of suspects/bad guys/victims/crazies.I guess my problem was all the hype comparing this to Tony Hillerman - it isn't. Mr. Mitchell does not catch the pathos of a Hillerman novel, nor should he. However, he does have an engaging voice and a sense of plotting. I thought the sexual politics pushed credulity a bit far and was a bit distracting from main plot.Overall, it is worth a look."
3,"Decent text, but a bit expensive","I purchased this book because it is required for a graduate level Engineering Management course I am taking. In terms of overall quality, I would give it an above-average rating. It does a decent job summarizing some of the work various management science experts throughout history and also providing useful summarized statistics about which management methods work and which don't work in a modern environment. In terms of price, I think it's a little overpriced for the amount and depth of material that is presented. At its current price of roughly $130, it's a book that's only going to be purchased when it's required text for a college course like mine."
3,Ok book,Used in an industrial engineering class at TexasA&M. It was just ok to me. Maybe it was the topic but I just did not see it to be interesting
4,Great condition,"Great condition. Shipping took longer than expected, but overall, very happy with this purchase."
4,A lovely addition to the kitchen,"A copper bowl is a great addition to a kitchen, especially for recipes requiring beaten eggs. It also looks great as a decorative element when not being used. The manufacturer recommends a lacquer remover that is hard to find before using the bowl for food products. Instead, boil six quarts of water, add three tablespoons of baking soda and dip the bowl into the mixture using tongs. Keep immersing it in the foaming water until you see little plastic-like bits floating in the water. Make sure the lacquer is completely off by rubbing the bowl with a soft sponge or cloth. Wash and hand dry."
3,"Bought it, would love to use it, but ...","As was written before you must remove the coating before using. I haven't been to the hardware store yet to buy the remover, and so this bowl is a great decoration to the kitchen but of no practical use.One of these days I will spend the money, take the time, and remove the lacquer, and I'm sure it'll whip up eggs just great.Bottom line, heed this and other reviews - just buying it is not the end of the process before you can use it.Looks great, though!"
4,Love it,I have never had a copper bowl before but heard they are the best for whipping eggs and heavy cream. I used it for whipping cream and what I heard is certainly true. I didn't give it the full five stars because it has a black mark inside the bowl which doesn't seem to affect its use.
5,good quality bowl,I bought this bowl for whisking egg whites and it is perfect for whisking them. It also has a nice slick brushed Copper look.
1,Don't Bother,"When I got the bowl it was beautiful. The next day, the oopper was wearing thin on the edges. Two days later it was showing black marks thoughout the bottom of the bowl. I only bought it for decorative purposes but two weeks later, it's not pretty enough to be deorative."
2,Almost identical to 1991 Edition - Look elsewhere,"I first started with the a book entitled, Moving to Arizona, published in 1991, then picked up this title, Arizona in Your Future, published in 1998, and writted by the same duo. The two books are the same! Minimal, very minimal updates, same use of tiny, completely undetailed maps and very bland reading. The ""Top 10"" reviewer who rated this book 5 stars obviously didn't read this book, just rated it. Please, make better use of your time and don't throw other readers off to heighten your standings as to the amount of books you review."
1,crime?,"What this book leaves out is that the main cities like Phoenix, Tucson have about the highest crime in the nation!"
3,Not impressed,I bought this book for my parents who are snowbirds and live in AZ during the winter months. They didn't find this book very useful. I wouldn't buy it again.
2,Brittish Wedding Humor,"I watched this movie on television and am very happy I didn't spend money to see it. While I enjoy some British humor, its not my favorite. If you enjoy Monte Python and modern British humor I'm betting that you'll enjoy the humor in this movie. However, be aware that there is full-frontal nudity of men and women. The wedding capers remind me of the show ""Who's Wedding Is It Anyway?"", with all the melodrama of families who want a nice wedding for their child, trying to forget that the wedding is a competition for the most unusual."
2,Boring!!,"Okay, I've seen a few mockumentaries in my day, like ""Best in Show"", ""Waiting For Guffman"", ""A Mighty Wind"" and so on! All of these films are truly funny...... ""Confetti"" is clearly not on par with these films.First off it is difficult to follow this movie because of the thick British accent and secondly it was slow moving and simply not that funny."
2,what a boredom,"the confetti magzine in london holds a wedding contest and chooses three would-be couples to do a wildest and the most creative wedding arrangement. the winner couple could win a house.... this movie is staged as a similar reality show with three very unlikable pairs to compete. there's one couple who are nudity enthusiasts, so if you like to see some naked ugly bodies, this movie is for you. another tennis playing couple and .... well, i've already forgotten, can you believe it? i simply failed to grasp the humor in british style and this one co-produced by bbc and fox searchlight i definitely could skip if i knew it'd have turned out such a bore. so far, i didn't see many english women who are attractive enough and could be called marginally 'pretty', and these three couples and other women appeared in this movie...well, you have to guess by yourself."
1,I'm never watching movies on amazon again,I really wanted to watch this movie but Amazon kept lagging to the point that I got so frustrated I just stopped watching and thus pretty much wasted my money
4,Interesting Account,"I've been reading a lot of these type of books in preparation for a trip I'm taking in July '09. I'm about half-way through this book. It's a little slow at times, but generally keeps moving. He's not a great writer, but the material is really interesting."
5,Very cute!,We bought this as a giftf for a 3-year old preschool - it is really cute. My 2 year old enjoys playing with it too.
3,Just OK,"I bought this for my 18 month old to use in the car on a road trip. She loves the book and playing with stickers, so I thought it would entertain her.I spent more time picking up the pieces from the floor than she did playing with it!Its cute, but the pieces DO NOT stick to the board. Its fun if you use it as if you were reading the story. But it definitely is not as cool as I thought it would be."
5,A Really Good Read,"The writing is splendid, the story is intriguing (I was kept in the dark as to the miscreant - no small feat). The protagonist is human and likeable, and the cast of characters a motley crowd of eccentrics. I loved this book, laughed my way through it (while puzzling),and truly hated turning the last page."
2,Where is the humor?,"Maybe it gets lost in translation. This British mystery is long on a kind of pseudo-sophistication and short on genuine wit or humor. The protagonist isn't particularly likable or even memorable. He seemed as amoral as the mystery's criminals, who deal cocaine, act as pimps, and arrange orgies for the amusement of spoiled internationals intent on combining a little education with a lot of vice. The only truly likable character is killed off early in the novel, making the rest of it an unappealing read."
5,Fantastic Book,"I loved this book. Of course, I've never found a book by Eugenia Price that I didn't like. But the Savannah Quartet ia great. Being a native Georgian, I loved the history that weaves through the book."
4,"Not Great, But Very Good","In this addition to the Tyler series, the last Spencer brother bites the dust. Eden and Brady are 2 long time Tyler residents; consequently, this book is a bit different from other books in the series. [Many of the other stories deal with a resident and a newcomer.] Eden has had a crush on Brady since she was a teenager. Brady had never noticed her other than as the owner of a local flower shop, where he's been doing a lot of business lately - as the Flower Phantom, sending flowers to little old ladies and others who need cheering up. They become friends, then more, then estranged, before finally ""realizing they were a match made in heaven."""
3,"I'm sorry I just don't really get this album, but it might be because...","I'm a guy. I found this in a bargain bin at a music store recently, never heard of Ms. Kray, but took a chance on it. The band is fine. There is obviously good musicianship around her. However, her lyrics, included in the booklet, seem despairingly puzzling to me. I'm sure she did not aim her CD right at men of 65, and younger audiences might love her style and vocal qualities. I'd like to hear another product from her, perhaps one with more up-tempo tunes."
1,"a cartoon book, not a chapter book",My son (age 8) was really disappointed in the Avatar books (we purchased all 3) because they look like chapter books but really they are just cartoon books and very basic cartoon books at that.We love everything Avatar but these books were a waste.
4,I liked this book but it was only half the epesode,Before the premere of the show i never really thought of watching it then the day of the premere my little sister was soooo happy to see it so i kept playing on the computer for five minutes when the premere was going on then i started to watch it i liked it i just wish they would show it on nick more :(
2,Book is 30 years old,"it was not at all clear that this book was written in the 70s. It's completely outdated. When i click on ""more info"" it shows me an excerpt from the 1994 hardcover.Waste of money. If year written is important, i won't buy used books from amazon again."
3,Effective protection but tastes funny,I was very excited to find this non-petroleum based SPF lip balm. It goes on smoothly but unfortunately left an aftertaste in my mouth so I have had to switch back to Blistik.
2,Stinks - literally...,"Good only for applications such as barns or outdoor areas with a lot of ventilation. Otherwise, you will be overwhelmed by the terrible smell. Also, did not attract flys inside our home."
1,What's that Smell?,"I bought this fly trap for my yard. Mistake! This is definitely made for farm use only. The smell was so powerful we took it down 10 minutes after hanging it and threw it away (wrapped in a ziploc bag). If you have a large area, far from people, this might be for you."
3,not the best,"I bought this for my husband but it isn't that great. I guess it's better than nothing but not as humorous and not as useful as 'Be Prepared' for example. Some of the points were plain dumb or even offensive to me when browsing it as a new (hormonal?) mom, while I (and he) found the BP book much better all round. We gave this one away pretty early on."
2,Condescending and unfunny.,"These are the sorts of books where you really have to find one on your level, and this was really shoots way, way below my level. Beyond making antiquated and sexist assumptions about the relationships between husbands and wives, the book is light on practical advice and heavy on sports metaphors low-brow yuk-yuk humor. I'm going to spend some time thumbing through this book's competitors before I buy another ""guide for dads."""
2,Cheaply made with undependable accessories.,"I'd like to be able to say that Toy Biz at least made an effort with this figure, but the truth is that this figure is made from cheap plastic, features awkward sculpting, and ships with lame accessories. Cap should be an easy character to accessorize (everyone knows he has a shield, right?), but this figure's spring-loaded ""shield launcher"" has a bad habit of springing itself to pieces. Even the shield falls apart into two pieces! If you're going to buy one Captain America figure, this should not be it."
5,Great book,Very nice book I read it to my class as introduction to the winter theme. Lots of facts along with fun story to keep children engaged. Beautiful illustrations as well.
4,Decent batteries at a reasonable price.,"From past experience with other Maxell batteries, they don't last quite as long as their Energizer or Duracell counterparts, but they are good quality and do hold quite a good charge. [...] The ones I ordered were delivered promptly. They were exactly the same size (not surprisingly) as the dead ones they were replacing. I assume the earlier reviewer just miss-ordered. I'm happy to recommend this item - good product, good value."
1,Disappointing,"This magazine subscription service leaves much to be desired. I have received only 5 magazines - half of the magazines promised. Contacting the seller did very little, just empty promises. The issues I did receive, were over a month old by the time I got them. Also, received two issues that were damaged; one water logged and the other was very crinkled and scuffed.I really enjoy this magazine, but the service is a gyp sandwich."
2,Shoddy shoe brand with notoriously defective soles,"Considering the price - the soles of Ecco's will fall apart in a few years even if you only wear them occasionally and the soles appear nearly new. Bought some at Nordstroms years ago, then the soles disintegrated. Nordstrom's sent them back to Ecco for a free resoling. This time the foam core which was replaced also turned into gummy crumbling mess 4 or 5 years later. Don't buy them."
1,These shoes are junk.,These shoes are a waste of your money. After having the almost new shoes resoled by Ecco the second set fell apart after being worn a dozen times. Tape your money to the bottom of your feet and you'll get a better result for your hard earned cash.
1,ECCO Shoes - unsatisfied with product - return process was easy.,"When we received the shoes, we were not satisfied with the color. One shoe was much darker than the other shoe - a lot darker.The return process was simple and we quickly received our credit."
3,Mixed Review,"These are probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Because of this fact, I continue to buy them.However, over the years, I have had trouble with the soles (by the way, company-suggested replacement soles offer almost no wear at all). My most recent purchase of a new pair of black/forest has had the toe stitching pull loose.Comfortable shoes; not so durable."
1,Rubber Soles & Heels Fall Apart,"An amazing thing happened to me. Although the dress shoes are supermax comfortable, I didn't wear them for a year or so. When I put them on this week I had them on for about an hour when chunks of rubber started falling off of the heel. Unfortunately, I was enroute to teaching a seminar out of state and I couldn't change them. For two days the rubber kept peeling off and falling off - rather embarrassing when standing in front of a group and hunks of your shoes stay behind when you move around.Frankly, I think it's funny because I'm 65 and not really worried about what people think of my shoes. But I sure won't buy Ecco again -- even though the shoes were probably the most comfortable dress shoes I ever have worn!Tom Nelson, Welches, Oregon, USA."
5,We love this DVD!,"A wonderful DVD for the holidays. We bought this last Christmas, and have enjoyed it all year. It comes with a darling wooden Holiday Caboose."
5,Bust My Buffers! Winter's nearly coming...,"Narrated by Alec Baldwin and George Carlin.This is one of _my_ best video I have ever heard from any websites I can hear. Well, let me view the episodes. [laugh]EPISODES ARE: -1) It's Only Snow2) Jack Frost3) Toby Had A Little Lamb4) Snow5) Thomas' Christmas Party6) Thomas & The Missing Christmas TreeRUNNING TIME - 35 Minutesby Michael Higham"
5,Don't Miss This One!,"Wow! Whew! Beautiful Chinese women with whips, a moving love story, Chinese culture and history, plus great erotic scenes!! This is without question the best and most unusual erotic novel I have ever read. Complete with a well thought out plot. Don't miss it. This is the way erotic novels should be."
3,A pleasant diversionary tale.,"An Interest-holding story with which to get through a lazy afternoon or a plane ride. Barrett does a great job of introducing and finishing the story with his pre and post notes that hint as if Rowley was a real person and theses are real memoirs. I don't rate this higher because I had trouble identifying Rowley as a character. Rowley doesn't give the impression that he's fallen ""in love"" with his captor (though he no doubt believes that he has), but rather he's been brainwashed by her. His actions and attitude indicate psychological injury not unlike a Patty Hearst Syndrome, and the reader ends up feeling a pathetic pity towards Rowley. Again, the best parts of the book are Barrett's own narratives, which entice you to research these Taiping warriors and learn more about this period of Chinese history. An ample escapist story to tide you over, but a far cry from 5 stars."
1,They tried,"I received this cable but it was not what I thought in length.They called me that very day to find out what was going on. I told them when reading their ad I could not tell the length. They asked me what I needed and I told them 20'. Two days later I had a 20' cable but it would not work? I did not understand this at all, but I know it is the cable because when I move the equipment and hooked up the older cable it reads the computer and runs fine."
5,Awesome mints even for those without allergies,"I tried these because a friend had allergies (I don't) but I am hooked. The honey goes down ""smoother"" than the sugar in regular mint patties. These mints are yummy!"
5,Perfect book for the dog lover,I found this book in a gift shop while vacationing last week. It is a lovely collection of pictures and an expression of the unconditional love dogs have for their owners and vice versa. It makes the perfect gift.
3,Video of the train set,Here is the video of the train set. It is fun to watch it going round and round and can be placed around the Christmas Tree.-- [...]
2,Disappointed,"We are a little disappointed with this train set. It doesn't stay on the tracks very well, especially when a child is starting or stopping it. Plus, it doesn't seem to be made very well. I wouldn't recommend this train to others."
3,CAT Train - OK,"Can be easily knocked off the tracks and needs parent assistance to get them back on. Other than that, it is a great value!"
3,Misleading description,We have this track and just so you know it is only 8 feetNoT 14 feet of track like it says in the descriptionOverall seems pretty durable compared to other tracks we have.The kids really like this set because it is so different than the other trains they have.
3,Simple train,"It is a simple plastic train. Not really worth what I paid for it. My son likes it ok but he isn't really that interested in it because once you put it on the track and watch it go around in circles, that is all there is. After I purchased it online, I found it at one of the local stores here for $15 less. I just didn't feel like going through the process of sending it back."
2,????,"I thought this book was gonna be about the BasedGod. It was aight, but not what I expected. Please don't name a book after Lil B the Based God if it's not about him in the future. Thank you."
1,"Poor writing, little factual support","I was really disappointed in this book. I'm not sure why my expectations were high, but I live in Atlanta and I vaguely remember this case. While I know little of Elaine Brown, I can say for sure she can't write and her thinking is muddled and hystrionic. I don't doubt her passion for the subject matter, but I found her theme difficult to factually support. Michael Lewis grew up in horrible conditions, no question, but her theory of a set-up or his victimization just made no sense. Skip this."
5,Fun for the whole family,"My son received this for his birthday, and I did not have high hopes for it. Similar to Go Fish, but with birds. After playing a few hands, my family has gotten addicted. My 4 year old is trying to read the names of the birds (educational bonus points here!) Also educational is having to remember who has which birds. Since they change hands during the course of the game, it is a good memory builder. The pictures on the cards are hysterical, the ""cheat"" factor that is part of the game is a novel idea. In all, a small, simple, quick game that has everyone thinking and laughing. I recommend for ages 4 and over. I helps to read the names, but younger kids will learn the pictures and be able to play right along with the older ones. I recommend this as a family game."
4,A Good Old Boy,"This book is good fun, not least because the author is obviously an opinionated all-American wind bag. But I liked what he had to say, from my experience it is mostly true. Boxing because of the way it is taught and practiced makes it realistic and applicable to the street. There are other fighting forms, thai-boxing, brazilian JJ, valetudo that are also streetwise but I guess Ned's point is that boxing should be the starting point of anyone's street style and I'd have to agree. As one of the other reviews about Ned states, his attack on other styles is at times a little over the top, he sometimes comes across as the kind of guy who likes to beat on small guys and call orientals 'gooks' but all things considered, it's worth a read and there are some good anecdotes about the 'golden age' of bareknuckle boxing."
5,BEST BOOK I EVER READ!!!!!!!,YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK< IT TELLS TEQUNIQES THAT MAKE YOU HIT EVEN HARDER THAN CHAMPIONSHIP STREETFIGHTING< YOU HAVE TO GET THIS BOOK
4,Great learner's picks,"My brother recommends these for his beginning mandolin students, and after picking upa lovely Paris Swing model, I got a dozen of these to start strumming with. No-frills, nice soft sound (less ""plinky"" for recording sessions), and affordable."
5,Good Advice!,I'm glad I follow my friends' suggestion to read this book. I could not put this book down! Rarely do you find such a readable novel that is so intelligently written.Rafe McGregor has managed to bring together fiction and real-life events into a perfect blend of thriller and mystery. I would strongly recommend The Secret Policeman to any reader who enjoys solid entertainment and also likes to root for a book's main character.And...a good ending.
2,NOT AS PICTURED,"As a previous reviewer said, you get a box of twelve, three markers each of four colors. No orange and no grape which were two of my favorite flavors."
2,Not what I expected,When I received the EXPO scented chisel tip markers there were twelve in the box but only four colours. I had thought there were to be eight colours and four black ones. Hope no one else gets caught on this.
1,Don't waste your money,"I was really disappointed to discover that this ebook version that Amazon is selling does not have a linked table of contents, which in a book of this size is utterly ridiculous. If I BUY a Kindle book I expect it to have the contents list as links. Not good Amazon, not good at all."
1,Poor scope,"Worthless...can't even hear my own heartbeat. Only faint sounds audible. Thinetal material very flimsy, bends and might actually break"
1,Simply Doesn't Work at ALL!,"I've always wanted a stethoscope, but since it's purely for my own curiosity, I didn't want to spend a lot. Big mistake. It arrived, I put it together, turned the valve a million times, and it simply doesn't work in the slightest. Absolutely nothing. So...now I have to waste even more time driving to the UPS store because I am too cheap to spend a few extra dollars on a better product."
1,I turned the switch . . .,". . . . but I was still dead! Having read all the reviews I decided to give this a chance. A mistake. I turned the head, as other reviewers instructed, but no sounds, at all. Clearly some purchasers are lucky and get a good one, obviously I didn't. It's going back."
4,Works OK after you rotate the head on the tube,"Didn't work at all as delivered, but saw another review that talked about a switch - just rotate the tube going into the head and it opens the tube so you can at least hear heartbeats. I was wondering why some people were having decent luck - theirs must have come set up properly. Nowhere on the package does it mention this - maybe we were just supposed to know..."
5,Needed Stethoscope,We needed a stethoscope to monitor our parents for heart and lung sounds. The automated sphygmomanometer was confused by their heart sounds so this helped us to take an accurate heart rate. Not fancy but does the trick.
3,No more form this guy,The product is fine except that they sent one of the wrong stethoscopes. I made several attempts to try and contact the merchant but he never returned my calls. I am not going to purchase from him again.
5,It has SWITCH!,"When it first came and I tried it on my child, but could not hear a thing! Then my five-year old noticed there is a turning switch on the tube part of the head. You just need to turn it on and try it again and then it works great. It should have been marked or provided with instructions."
4,Great customer service by Mr.Ben,"I recd. a first one which did not work. I left a feedback rating this useless. However, immediately Mr.Ben from bpmedicalsupplies contacted me and set me another one promptly. The second one was working perfectly.I recommend product particularly for the customer service offered."
2,Stethoscope was a disappointment,I always keep a emergency medical kit in the house. I had sent my stethoscope off with my daughter when she moved out. I purchased this to replace it. It is cheap plastic and doesn't work well at all.I had a terrible time getting it together.
5,works,This product works well. I'm not a doctor. I just bought this for my son to use in his doctor kit. It is good quality and will do the trick for us for some days of fun.
1,Jackie,"These 4 stethoscopes are totally inadequate. It is very hard and difficult to hear the heart beat, extremely faint, if not at all."
5,Stethoscope,Have not used this item yet but I am sure it will work for me when the need comes about.
1,Don't buy!!! Does not work!!!,"I bought this to put in my daughter's dress up kit so she could be a doctor. I chose this because it was less expensive than the ""play"" stethoscopes...now I know why! Honestly, it's perfectly fine for my purposes and it does amplify sounds, so I'm sure my little one will like it, but I would hate to see a medical professional waste their time or money on this product! You absolutely can not find a heartbeat with it."
2,"Seems real, but","I do not have much to compare this to, but I suspect that there are better stethoscopes out there. I bought this for the kids since it was so cheap and thought it would be 'cooler' than the toy ones. Probably makes no difference to them."
1,TITLE,"THIS STETHOSCOPE HAS A FINE APPEARANCE.FUNCTIONALLY HOWEVER, IT'S ALMOST USELESS. IF THE ROOM IS SILENT, ANDYOU REALLY CONCENTRATE, YOU CAN FAINTLY HEAR A HEART BEAT.YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
3,Good price but uncomfortable,"So I'll be honest, we bought these due to the cheap price and, since they do exactly what they're advertised to do, I can't be too mad... but I will say I can only have them in my ears for about 30 seconds until the pain it causes in my ear from the hard plastic pressing hard against the bone/cartilage is too much to bear... these things are the most uncomfortable pair I've ever tried... but again, they work well so if you're looking for price and functionality versus comfort, these are perfect."
1,doesn't work,"what can i say? I can't hear anything with it, not my heartbeat or my dogs, not even other sounds like a ticking clock. it doesn't work."
3,"Ok, but I wouldn't use the whole thing","Product comes with two sets of earpieces, each different types. Works well. The only complaint I would have is the that alignment of the parts that go to the ears do not line up, so it presses unevenly in my ears. It was uncomfortable when I put them on.I have another stethoscope that fits much better, but the part that picks up sound is thin on that one. This one is thicker, so I just switched the bottoms and use my old stethoscope. Hope that helps."
4,wonderful story,"Until I read this book, I always thought the OED was just another dictionary. How wrong I was! This book begins with a short history of the english language, then proceeds to discuss why the OED was undertaken, and all the players involved. I've come to think of James Murray, the main editor of the OED, as a hero. The OED is a complete listing of ALL the words ever recorded in the english language, and it took 71 years to complete. The Meaning of Everything was a great introduction into this endeavor and left me wanting to know more.One problem with the book is that it, rightly so, discusses James Murray's involvment at length, however, I feel that it short-changed the editors who took over after Murray. This book is really about Murray and the OED, not the entire project. I wanted to know much more about Craigie and Onions -- their personal history, triumphs, and defeats -- as editors."
4,For Logophiles and Lexicography Buffs,"I think that the degree to which you enjoy this book will be directly proportional to how much you are interested in etymology, the history of the examination of etymologies, lexicography, and your love for words. My complaint was that the author did not have a style that further grabbed my interest. I normally don't experience any irritation over a writing style that doesn't suit me, but when it comes to this sort of book, the snob in me comes out."
3,Disappointed,"I expected the book to be an intriguing and fast moving story about how the OED was made, but it was not. The 71 years of the dictionary was unbelievably boring.Perhaps this book would be very useful for one trying to educate him or herself as much as possible on the topic, but it didn't bring the leisure reading I was looking forward to."
2,Great story ruined by bad writing,"I loved Krakatoa, the only Winchester book I'd read before this, and I'm fascinated by language history and evolution, so I had high hopes for this. I was disappointed. I had noticed Winchester's tendency to lapse into flowery, overwritten prose in Krakatoa, but apparently when he wrote The Professor and the Madman he hadn't yet learned any control over it at all. This pompous style makes the elementary usage errors and sloppy style with which the book is riddled even more irritating. What is his editor's excuse, I'd like to know?There's an interesting story here, and on the level of the entire book it's actually structured very well. I love Winchester's digressive writing style--at its best, it conveys an invigorating curiosity about the world and an almost childlike enthusiasm that's contagious. For me, though, the execrable prose style kept the book from being enjoyable--and given the position of strength it was coming from, that was a big disappointment."
2,The meaning of everything shot out of a cannon,"I knew I was in trouble with this book when I found myself fantasizing about cleaning my bathroom to avoid reading.I'm in full agreement with the critique posted Octobert 22 by a reveiwer from CT. This book seemed thrown together capriciously, as if bits of information were written on confetti and blown out of a cannon.Still, I gave the book two stars for content; albeit some of that content, in the form of footnotes, seemed like filler."
2,Not childcare specific,"This book is not specific to the childcare industry. The authors have thrown information about childcare in here and there, but the book is basically a template for a business start up. I just opened a preschool with 80 children and a lot of what is in this book does not pertain to our industry."
5,This works great. You know it is a great product if it is working for three months on my Great Danes in Florida HOT Summer.,This works great. You know it is a great product if it is working for three months on my Great Danes in Florida HOT Summer
1,"awesome collar -- updated, now unhappy","Since putting this on my dog, I've found 2 ticks and one of those was a day or two after putting the collar on. It was dead when i found it. The other tick was dying. Normally in the 6 weeks or so that the collar has been on, I'd have found at least twenty ticks at this time of the year. Great advice from our vet to get this!--After being on my dog for a few months, he became extremely lethargic like he was a very old dog. He also would recover from minor joint or tendon injuring. After removing for a few days, he was like a puppy again. NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Hot Pursuit,"Once upon a time, Emma and Christopher were friends, but they had drifted apart. Now, when Dirty Secrets lead to deadly trouble, the two will reunite to solve a mystery and perhaps get a second chance to be more than friends. Karen Rose delivers an excellent mini-novel to start off the story collection. Necessary Betrayals by Annie Solomon is the star of the group. Quinn Parker put Francesca's father in jail and broke her heart, but when her sister is kidnapped, she turns to him to get the girl back, never dreaming how high a price Quinn may have to pay. Finally, in Endless Night, a blind date turns into something dangerous, and Clay will have to save Amanda's life before the date is over.*** Annie Solomon's story is the winning entry, but Karen Rose's is also worthwhile. Carla Cassidy's story is one you can take or leave, but the other two are worth the price of the entire collection. ***Amanda Killgore"
5,Oh My God!,"Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!! Oh My God!!!I have always been a Kerry Livgren fan, given that I absolutely LOVE Kansas from their very first album all the way up through Monolith. This album, is part fantastic prog and part ""good old fashioned rock 'n roll."" And the final track on disc 1, ""Theophany,"" fits quite easily into the top 10 prog epics ever, and at the very least, the top 50 songs of all time.Kerry, how do you do it!?!Pleeeeeeeeeease buy this CD. It is amazing. It is on par with the best that Kansas ever did."
5,Wonderful collection of music,This was a gift for my husband's birthday and he has thoroughly enjoyed it. It stays in his CD player. He is an avid Kansas fan and he loves this CD.
5,This is a MASTERPIECE - Not to be missed!,"First off, if could give 6 stars, I would. This is incredible, multi-layered, classic '70s-era progressive rock with current-era production. Flute on almost every song, beautiful harmonies, great vocals, orchestrated keys and Kerry's brilliant guitar-work make up this CD. Kerry has created a masterpiece. I judge a CD by how long it stays in the 6-disc rotation in my car. It's not only still in the rotation, but I find myself going back to it on a regular basis. Bottom Line: Buy this CD."
2,NOT REAL GLASS,The door knob is not worth almost $70. The description claimed it is european cut crystal glass it isn't even glass! The handles are not as sturdy as I would like. After installing the door knob there was extra play in the knobs even after tightening the screws to the point where they almost were stripped. Disapointed in this product.
5,This book was very inspiring,"This inspiring book tells true stories about everyday people receiving healings from honest, simple prayers. The writing style is very readable. I enjoyed this book very much."
4,Christmas book,"I don't remember buying this, if I did it was a gift for my daughter, who collects Christmas books. I will have to ask her."
5,Good quality cable at reasonable price.,This is just an extension cable to be used for a keyboard. Most keyboards today have very short cables and this fixed the problem. You may want to tape the two cables together with electrical tape to prevent them from pulling apart but mine had not pulled out so far.
5,Extension Cables,Ext. Cables were just the right thing needed to suit the job!Not much more can be said about their product!
5,Belkin Keyboard Extension Cable,"Not much to say about a cable that works. Does its job, the price is right. Appears to be of good quality. Have not had it disconnect as at least one other reviewer wrote, but then I routed and secured it so that it wouldn't move."
3,good price for a staple,"Good buy for note pads. Beats the brick and mortar price for the same product. Arrived quickly, would buy again."
3,Not as good as I hoped...,"I have to say I was disappointed - it may just have been my batch, but the texture was closer to mass-produced supermarket cheddar rather than a raw milk boutique cheese. Rubbery mouth feel and a mild, innocuous taste. I was hoping for much more from this cheese based on the write up and awards. Overall, this is an easy to eat cheese that would be good to serve to friends who are put off by stronger, flavorful cheeses."
3,Two flawed generals,"The Civil War in the Trans-Mississippi, especially after the fall of Vicksburg, has gotten relatively little attention from historians. This book deals with the conflict between the two key leaders of Confederate troops in the region. Richard Taylor comes across as an aggressive fighter, but is also an impossible subordinate and anything but a team player. Edmund Kirby Smith is somewhat like McClellan...a good administrator but a disastrous field general. The author's prose is somewhat dry and the battle descriptions are sometimes a bit circuitous. However, he shows good insight into several personalities and understands the political dimensions of the war in this region. This is not the book to read as an introduction to tbe Civil War west of the Mississippi. However, it will be of interest to those with a strong general background and specialized interests."
3,nice fit but....,they got a hole in it right away. :( i got these for my husband and he likes the pockets and the fit but i was annoyed they got a hole after the first wash. luckily it was right on the seam and i have a sewing machine so i could fix them easily but that just seems like poor craftmanship. but now that they are fixed he's been wearing them pretty regularly to the gym for a few months and he is satisfied with them.
2,it was okay,"When product arrived I was surprised. I expected the leg length of the shorts to be 2 inches longer. Otherwise everything is okay and I'm not saying that I won't purchase again , but I will be more careful when I order"
5,Perfect,"Exactly what I wanted in gym shorts. Pockets are the best part. These run true to size, maybe a little shorter than I would have expected being advertised as ""long"". The small comes mid-kneecap on me and I'm only 5'1"""
2,Not great,These shorts are cheap and so am I so i bought them. They aren't great. Spend the extra and get something decent unless you are just buying them for around the house
5,Excellent,It is what I am looking for and serves my needs. Will order this type of products more in the future.
5,Who wears short shorts?,Not me. These things come down to my knees. They're good for working around the yard/house but also light/thin enough to sleep in. You can also impress the ladies by making your junk dance. Solid shorts.
4,What You Expect From a Pair of Shorts,"Exactly what somebody would expect from a normal pair of shorts. Just make sure that you order a bit bigger than what your size is. For example, I had to order an extra large for the shorts to go down to my knees (I am six feet tall)"
3,OK Shorts,"These short are OK, but the pockets aren't easy to put your hands into, and the material is not as nice as the Under Armour flex shorts. I paid twice as much for the Under Armour shorts, but am much happier with them."
3,Long and Wide Shorts,"I got the long version of these shorts hoping they would be longer but not wider in the legs. I think I just got a large size pair with a medium tag. The only thing longer than average about these shorts is the pockets. They are nearly as long as the leg, and if you have keys in your pocket, the whole short will swing wildly as you walk. Meh."
2,Pockets suck,"These are cheap shorts so I don't know how much I ought to have expected, but the pockets hang almost lower than the shorts and it's really uncomfortable to walk around in them with anything in the pockets bouncing against my legs. Would not recommend."
3,Shiny,"Being a traditional cotton guy, having a ""shiny"" pair was different. But hey they do everything they should -not sure of the wear I will get, but cotton does tend to fade after a few wash cycles."
5,Champion shorts,"These are great! I use them for my ball hockey league, I am an adult at 5'10"" 200lbs but the large fit perfect. The only thing I changed myself about them is that they are a drawstring type of athletic short. The drawstring was a loop though, and not two individual strings, which unless you feel like getting a knot out for 10 minutes I suggest cutting the loop and making two tied ends on two individual strings so that you can tie them together like a shoe lace and it makes it much easier especially if you are in sports.Overall, I really like them, they are soft and smooth for any athlete or even just to wear."
3,"Run large, elastic seems weak","I purchased two pairs of these shorts in size Large, I found them to be very loose on my waist and all my exercise shorts are size Large. The main thing is that they seem to run very large at the waist. I laid them next to a pair of Nike shorts (similar style, also size Large), these Champion shorts were almost 2 inches wider at the waist (unstretched). In addition, the elastic doesn't seem as strong as the Nikes (but it might be fine if I get a smaller size). I also don't like the ""stretchy shoelace"" style of drawstring, it was tough to cinch the shorts tight enough. Finally, as other reviews have noted, the shorts aren't lined and aren't very thick - this is good for ventilation, but might give a show under bright gym lights."
4,nice short but slow shipping,"These shorts are very comfortable, however why did Amazon take 6 days to finally ship. Although this isn't the fault of the product, it's something to consider before buying through Amazon. Product rating is for the product. Amazon would only get a two star. Just a little thicker lining would have given a 5 star."
3,Elastic waistband is not very elastic,"The shorts are really nice, but the only problem I find with them is the elastic waistband is not a real tight elastic I wear a size 44 waist and I usually buy a 42 waist with an elastic waistband and they fit perfect and the elastic waistband keeps them up and don't have to use the tie strings even with tie strings as far as they can go these pants fall down if your not careful, otherwise the shorts are great! PS. The price was great!"
5,Good shorts,Very lightweight for the warmer weather. I like loose fitting clothing. This fit the bill.
1,I don't know if the other reviewers are humans.,"The leg openings at the bottom feel like there is a plastic tube cutting circulation while you move; like a feeling of resistance. Ever have your arm wrapped with the little string when you are about to get a vaccine shot or an IV? It feels sort of like that.I am a thin guy, I wear slim cut jeans (32x32)and I bought Medium (32-34 waist). Maybe a Large would be better but as you can see, all the other reviewers claimed they are ""loose"".Other than that, the material feels cheap and these shorts remind me of hand-me-down basketball shorts I used to get in grade school 15 years ago."
5,Excellent summer-wear.,"These shorts breathe well and fry off lightning-fast. They look hip, and the addition of deep pockets is very handy."
2,item not as described,"I ordered 3 pairs of these shorts for my boyfriend, who is 6'4"", because the item was described as ""long"". We were both highly disappointed in the quality of the shorts and the length. The material is VERY thin and the length was shorter than average."
2,Picture is deceiving,The shorts are comfortable with one loop draw string in the front - not the dual shoe lace kind.They breathe well and fit on the waist or just below very easilythe elastic is cheap and feels so at first use.The length allows them to ride up about 4-5 inches above the knee making them just a tad longerthen the scary old man shorts you see at the gym. when working out.all in all decent but for the money may be better to hit a big box or discount store and find a betterpair.
3,a little short,"I am 6'2 and bought these shorts thinking that they would fit me like they do the guy on the picture. I was sorely mistaken. They are about mid thigh length, but are also very comfortable for running so i decided to keep them. Great quality, just know that they are not that long."
2,Nice and Comfortable,These are nice shorts that are lightweight and comfortable to wear but be sure to have somethng to ware under them.
2,Blah,These are see through! You will have to wear something under neath of them to go outside in them. Which I didn't see in the description.
3,"disappointing, not the best for running","I have used Champion shorts quite a bit over the years and these are not as good as the others I have had.There is no back pocket at all, I really miss the back pocket with zipper my other Champion shorts have. The over size front pockets wrap around the outer side of my thigh so when I run, whatever is in the pocket bounces, even with just one car key (one very light key) The key bounces around all over the place when I run... It is distracting and also feels like you may lose whatever is in there. Running with a key fob no way, I don't run in these when I drive that car.Also I am not sure on the size..In the description they claim to be longer, they are NOT longer but they are roomier/baggier, I suppose if you are thick in the thighs these might be worth a look but for me too baggy.So they may still be okay to lounge in or for light work outs , For me they are not so good for running."
4,Good shorts,"Overall these shorts are very good and at a very reasonable price. The only thing off about these shorts was that they appeared to run large. I ordered a large, I tend to run between a medium and a large. I own two other champion long mesh shorts and these are slightly larger than the blue and black shorts. Otherwise, they are perfect; but be warned, do not rip off the tag, as it will tear the stitching."
3,Champion Men's Mesh Short,"I have a few pair of Champion gym shorts that are great, so when I saw these I bought a couple pair thinking they'd be as comfortable as the ones I already owned. They were not. I bought two pair of the same size (different color). These shorts wore very tight to the leg, not loosely like other gym shorts I owned. And this is not because they didn't fit, they did, it was simply the cut of these shorts. They also have a very rigid tag on the inside back seam that is very uncomfortable and will rip the seam if removed. I gave it a 3 star review for the fact they only cost $11 so I suppose I got what I paid for."
3,"Cheap, light, super deep pockets","The shorts are a decent deal because they are very cheap and good quality for the price. However, the pockets are absurdly deep. You cannot do anything active that involves motion with something heavy, like a phone, in your pocket."
3,Pretty good gym shorts,"The holes in the white color can make it seem like you are being indecent, so be careful with that."
2,See Through,"Quality made, but you can see right through these to whatever you may or may not be wearing underneath. This probably happens only on the white version though. They need to add another layer or something."
3,"Great price, but not that comfortable","I wanted to pick up a pair of cheap shorts with pockets for wearing around the house when it's warm. These fit the bill -- they're inexpensive and pull on easily, just the thing for lounging around. Also would be fine for working out in since the pockets are nice and flush to decrease the chance of catching the pocket with your hands if you're running hard. The mesh material is cool in warm weather and feels nice and soft against the skin.However, the cut of the shorts feels odd. I can't quite put my finger on it but it feels like the thighs are too tight or the front is too small; as I move around there's a bit of restriction on movement. Not enough to feel like something might rip, but I definitely feel it whenever I wear these.Still, for $10 shipped, it's a fine purchase."
2,Not as listed,"BE CAREFUL! The description is misleading. The charge is NOT for a box of a dozen as it says, but for a single marker. I thought I'd found an amazing deal, but ended up having to have my purchase money refunded when I got ten markers instead of the ten dozen this page and my purchase order indicated that I had bought."
1,Appleton Cuyas English/Spanish/Spanish/English Dictionary,"I paid an arm and a leg ($86.84) for what I thought was a new dictionary. Instead, I was sold an old paperback dictionary,yellow and beat up. On the back cover the price for $4.95 was stamped.I am upset at the way Any Book has treated me as a customer. Shame on them for selling me something I did not order. Is that false advertisement or what?Be assured I will never do business with this company again. Save yourself time and money, don't order from Any Book Bookstore.S.S.Canales"
5,Very user friendly,I have cooked from many of Ms. Morgan's books -- the midnight munchies and the dips one in particular. She has done it again. With fantastic recipes that are easy to follow and delicious to eat. Nothing about this book is ordinary. It is a great addition to my cookbook shelf.Great work and looking forward to more of her books
1,Smelled awful,"It smelled like it had been sitting around for a long time, definitely not how I remember it should smell. I will throw this one away."
1,Book that is Lacking,"I was disappointed with this book; in fact, I immediately gave it away. It had boring descriptions about procedures and veggies and fruit that were not really useful. Lacking in real information and good recipies."
2,So many ingredients,"I bought this book trying to find a good healthy recipe book for smoothies. It is fine if you want to buy tons of different types of ingredients for one smoothie, but I was just starting smoothies and didn't have all the things needed at that time. I have found better simpler recipes just using Google and experimenting on my own."
2,OK,"Noty the best book,,, has some weight loss recipe where you use TOFU,,, but nothing to exciting,,,, LOOK up on the net for good recipes"
3,Slim Smoothies,"Great recipes. I was just hoping for more that had just ice, fruits and fruit juices rather than yogurt."
2,Smoothies,I like smoothies and was disappointed that there were only 15 pages of low calorie smoothies. For the most part the recipes were repetitive. I could have found that online.
5,"Good low cal recipes -- once you get past the ""cutsie"" names and descriptions.","The recipes are easy, require ingredients easy to find in your supermarket and the additional information provided is interesting. Most importantly, the Smoothies are tasty. On a minor note - I found the ""cutsie"" names and descriptions unwitty and distracting."
5,Sumatran Orangutan,This entertaining documentry is about the Sumatran Orangutan and its habbits and how it survives in a world that continues to change thanks to man who continues to cut down his forest homes.
1,"Never, ever, EVER again!!!!!","It's a pity there is no option for either zero or negative stars. I recently bought a 10-pack of RCA videotapes, and quite frankly, I wish I'd thrown my money in the street instead. These things are absolutely, positively horrid! The tape is wound too loosely on the reels, and there is NO RATCHETING MECHANISM to tighten the tape! It flops around inside the housing, and if you rewind it, it gets even worse! EVERY SINGLE TAPE IN THE PACKAGE is like this! RCA has cheaped out well beyond the point of ridiculous, and I will NEVER AGAIN buy their videotapes!!!!!!!"
5,Incredible knowledge of the game,"Awesome video of the game. If you want to coach, learn it from the best."
4,A very intelectual book,"This book was the perfect book for any school asignment. It gave very specific facts and dates. It only lacked in the fact that it was kind of boring. It gets more interesting as you go along though. Overall, it was a very good book."
1,Slopped up...not Chopped up! (FA REAL!),"Ummmmm, this is horrible. Can't say it no other way! Selection is good, but 007 needs his DJ card pulled and Jive need to be straight cussed out! Pleeeeeeaaaaasssseeeee.......DON""T waste your money on this!!!!!!!!"
3,"same brand, not smae quality","I have ordered this brand before, not from this supplier. The bags I received are very different quality...seem much thinner. Haven't had issues yet of any tearing, but the quality definitely is not the same"
1,Bad Bag,The bags are stuck together. When you try to open a bag you have to be very carefull as they are like glued together.
2,"These have no Rule, let alone a wide rule","Don't buy this if you are expecting a 2+ inch rule down the left side (e.g. a wide rule, a legal pad). These have no rule whatsoever. Just a yellow pad with horizontal lines. Fail."
3,Just buy the max-grip version instead,"If a nylon pick is what feels most comfortable to you, and you have a preference for a thicker-than-average pick, then this is probably the 2nd best option that's available to you. While this is a satisfactory pick, I can't image any reason why Dunlop doesn't just make all of their nylon picks the max-grip version, as that seems to hold every advantage over the standard style with no apparent drawbacks. If you're a user of nylon picks of this thickness, you've never had a problem with dropping picks, and your thumb pads don't agree with the highly textured back of max grip picks, then this is probably the pick for you."
1,Useless,"These two have killed Gershwin. They have slowed the temp by half, filled all of the rests with trills, and show no musical talent through the climaxes of the piece as they bang around on the piano. Get ""Gershwin Plays Rhapsody in Blue"" at least the interpretation is right on that CD."
1,crap,"These two hair salon layabouts seem to enjoy stumbling over each other as they try to impress upon us (very much in the way a piano dropped from the empire state building would make an impression) just what cracker-jack piano players they are. Gershwin rolls in his grave as his infinitely cool compositions are transformed into obnoxiously corny lounge music. Fortunately for me, I only checked this out at the local library, searching in vain for a Gershwin CD without the typical orchestra treatment. I have half a mind to put several extra scratches on it before I return it."
3,duck fan wearing it,"the hands are a little difficult to see on white background-otherwise not too gaudy like some of the others. Band is good,"
3,Decent,"This was a required text for my undergrad macro econ course. We covered almost the entire text and not being much of one for graphs, I wished this book had less of them (it has oodles of them) and instead more applicable references to everyday examples."
5,Addresses the psychological aspect of recovery.,"Excellent example of music and instrutional guidance for mental imagery and healing. Very useful, especially to a cancer survivor as I am. This technology is idespensible for additional treatment methods for serious illness!I recommend it highly!"
3,Sigh...,"This book is o.k., just o.k.. The advice is fine but not revolutionary. There are other resources which can and do, cover the same subjects with greater clarity.I recommend The Pocket Stylist which remains my all-time favorite (I am a bit addicted to books on fashion and style)."
3,Better books out there,"Too much psychology and not enough strategies...Try ""Ready to Wear"", ""The Pocket Stylist"" or ""Does This Make Me Look Fat?""."
1,Author needs work on getting her facts correct.,"This book is not well written and the author needs to read the Quran and verify her facts. For example, she writes that a Muslim man can marry people of the book. This is correct but she includes Hindus and Zoroastrians in the list. This is far from the truth. Only Jews and Christians are the people of the book, no other. I do not recommend this book."
2,Falls out easily!,"The earpiece is too big and round to fit in your ear easily. I thought my ears might just be small but everyone else who tries it on has the same problem. I have to hold it in when I'm talking which defeats the purpose of ""handsfree"". It does have good clarity and volume though."
4,"Simple, but a good primer","The book is noticeably dated, but it was written over a hundred years ago. Being none too familiar with the history of Spain before reading it, I found it a good primer for finding topics to delve into deeper in other works. Being short as it is, it is quick to read and raises more questions to someone wishing to learn the history of the country than it gives answers, but that is to be expected in a book attempting to convey the thousand plus year history of a land in 120 pages.In short, if you are looking for an in-depth history of Spain, complete with investigation of all the intrigue and controversy this land has accumulated, you may want to look elsewhere. If you are trying to get a rough idea or are just starting to familiarize yourself with this country's history, this is a good book. If nothing else, you can invest an afternoon in it and note topics to visit more thoroughly in other works. In all, an enjoyable read."
1,Childish and over simplified. Ignores controversy.,"Going to Spain I wanted to read about Spanish History. I downloaded this and it was like a child's bookmaking everything happy and devoid of the fascinating history of Spain.For a simple example, it writes that bull fighters are the heroes of Spanish children and the people.This ignores the growing controversy, evidenced that Bull Fighting has been banned in parts of Spain,such as Valencia.All interesting topics are handled in this childish manner."
5,The book presents a good logical view of testing.,"I skipped through the first half of the book, as it covers basic computer science. What caught my attention was the development of the operational thread concept. Operational threads being a conceptual sequence of events, activity, and data that describe how the software should work. The book shows what they are, and how to use them to develop regression tests and other test forms. The down side is the use of the term ""thread"". It creates confusion with the ""thread"" used by operating systems."
4,Good book for the basic understanding of testing,Really its very good book for the basic understanding about the testing. Advance topics are just given as a overview. User might expect one more book from the same authour for detail of advance topics.....RegardsSatish Mishra
4,Thoughtful Examination of Software Testing,"Software testing, being one of life's most bewitching pursuits creates challenges for its practioners. Constantly caught in an identity crisis (not development, not sales,) software testing suffers from lack of appreciation.This book helps guide testing in a direction that is more professional and thoughtful toward the subject."
3,"INTERESTING! GOOD EFFORT, BUT WITH SOME FLAWS.","This Vincent Meylan's ""Queens' Jewels"" makes an interesting read. It did a good job on the English aristocracy/monarchy. The same applied to the French, the Scandinavian, and the Russian overlords. Its chapters were well-grouped and well-sectioned: thus making it easy for readers to select whatever interests them with great ease.Sadly, little effort was made as to improve the quality of the included photographs. Also, some of the information which Mr. Meylan presented were flawed. And, the details of some royal treasures, (particularly those of Italy, Austro-Hungary, Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal) were scanty.Overall, this is a good book (if one ignores its pardonable errors and omissions)."
5,Not what I expected by definitely a 5!!!,"I don't know how this film got lost in the theatres, but it is definitely a 5. I expected something entirely different, but this one was PROFOUND, BEAUTIFUL, THOUGHT-PROVOKING and warmly depressing. Depressing is a negative word, but in this case, it is definitely a positive. The camera-work is superb. The soundtrack will tug at your heartsrings...and the 3 stories will blow you away. Yes. There are 3 stories about 3 needles. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but when you watch this trio, you will understand. I never give away plots, but let me tell you, these actors and actresses give their all. I bought this because of Lucy Liu (a total professional). She's great, but wait until you see Chloe Sevigny, Stockard Channing, Shawn Ashmore and a cast of classics. The storylines are riveting...with a touch of sadness that hits on reality...painful reality. GREAT MOVIE! You won't be disappointed and you'll keep this in your library forever."
5,"Three Knockdown, Drag Out Stories for Every Adult Viewer...","Each of the three stories could stand alone and be very meaningful, but together, they are more powerful than most of the AIDs related films I've seen. So extremely varied in content, yet each heart-wrentching story fit perfectly together.You can read some reviews that might take the surprise out of the stories. I watched the film without any detailed information on the film and was not only pleasantly surprised, I was knocked to the ground and run over by a Mack Truck.Fantastic cast, fantastic writing, fantastic direction...FANTASTIC!"
4,I liked this movie.,"This was a very interesting take on people in different lives, HIV, and AIDS. It's very interesting. I would recommend watching it."
1,ONE STAR FOR SCENERY - THAT'S ALL!,"This was a most disappointing movie. Very drawn out, 90 percent subtitled, and totally boring. The only saving grace for it was the scenery. The subtitling went so fast in spots that it didn't give the viewer any time to read what was being said before the scene and/or subtitling changed. A total waste of time and money in my opinion."
2,This video lacks consistency in number of reps,"With her first oblique workout for Beginners, she does not give equal reps and time on the left side as she does the right side.For her Intermediate workout, she doesn't tell you really how to breathe when you do the oblique reps."
2,Not as great as i expected,"I have been doing ab classes at my gym 5 days a week, then i moved and I have been looking for a good ab workout to do at home. I am fairly intermediate, and i found this tape boring, and not challenging at all!!! I kept waiting for the exercises to get harder, but they never did and I barely worked my abs. okay for beginners, BAD FOR INTERMEDIATES..."
1,Can you say Copyright Infringement?,This is a sub standard DVD-R copy and is obviously breaking many international laws infringing on the copyright of this film. The movie itself is poorly acted and the copy is blurry and a very inferior copy of a copy of a copy. My advice is to stay away from this DVD-R copy.Shame on you Amazon!
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"GREAT PRODUCT I USE IT EVERY TIME, BUT ITS GETTING HARDER TO FIND AT RANDOM STORES... AVOIDED ANY HASSLES WILL DEFINALLY PURCHASE AGAIN"
3,Too watery,Was suggested to use this product. I didn't like the fact that this face wash is too watery. I wish it was a little thicker so that it doesn't drip to the neck and chest area when applied to the face. Instead I used clean&clear version which has 5% Benzyl Peroxide and it also exfoliates.
2,Beware! Bleaching effect,Don't use towel afterward and avoid contact with clothes when using this product. This product has sort of bleaching effect (ruins the colors). It ruined a very expensive towel! Regarding the actual effect of the product on acne I am not sure. We have been using it only for a week. My wife thinks its helping her. I don't think it is helping me in any way. Both of us have occasional break outs.
3,Alright...,"It DID do a very good job of stripping my face of everything (including my face's essential oils), but as a result of the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide, it left my skin very very dry, which I would just follow-up with a moisturizer. I can't say that it did anything for my acne either. Recently I have gone all-natural in terms of facial care, and I am was wild about all the chemicals I was using on my face with this product, so, consequently, I had to ditch this. Maybe it will work for you, but it just didn't work for me."
2,Meh.,"I used this product for a month and saw little to no results from it. I bought it mainly to use on my back, as my bacne tends to flare up in the winter and I needed an easy benzoyl peroxide product to apply to it daily, as I have had success with it on my face but the cream bleaches the backs of my shirts if I apply it to my back. This product just simply didn't work."
2,2.5 stars.,"Athena is the daughter of a king, his only child. However, as a girl, she can not hope to inherit, though her mother insists that she should. Her father's plan is for Athena to marry his brother Poseidon, an arrogant man of few morals. Yet, it is a commoner who Athena loves. Moreover, she knows she can be a better queen than her uncle can be king. In a series of adventures that strips the magic from Greek myths, rendering them in mortal terms, Athena comes into her own, preparing her to face the final challenge, where she will prove she is the better of the two.** Though this is a pleasant enough story, the characters are somewhat hard to relate to. The myths are better with the magical element intact, simply put. However, Athena's Tale is fairly interesting. If Morgan Llewlyn's novels are daunting yet intrigue you, this is a lightweight choice for you. **Amanda Killgore"
4,Why 4 stars instead of 5,"This recording is GREAT. Real music and REAL ROCK AND ROLL is supposed to have some grit, rawness, ups and downs and slight imperfections. All that said, it's not like this was recorded on a micro-cassette recorder. Lots of great sonics herein. There's no such thing as a ""5"" except in symphony orchestras. This CD has grown on me beautifully. This is true altrenative indie music sans the short-change on songwriting."
2,Not Great,"This book has interesting pieces but overall it is disturbing. The main character Antonia is extremely naive and her relationship with Adam Savage is creepy. He is significantly older then her and was potentially going to be her stepfather. There is one point where she compares him to ALL male figures in her life, including lover and father. The book would have been better if her deception would have been carried out until Anthony arrived back in England and the hero should have been someone more appropriate rather than her much older guardian."
3,Entertaining But Very Slow..,"I am gonna have to agree with most of the reviews here. Although this is not a bad book it could've been much better. I've read most of the books by VH and by far this book dragged on the most.H/H does not meet til 130+ pgs later, the book itself 530+ long... there are very little romance til much later since hero does not know for 3/4 of the novel the heroine is in fact a female.The Heroine on the other hand is very aware of the hero, the book is filled with her pining for him, her jealousy when he's with other woman since he doesn't know who she really is. Her infatuation with him is very obvious, it can all seem very dull at times, but don't lose hope, it does pick up 1/4 from the end. You'll have a about 100pgs worth of romance btw the H/H til you're done.Over all, very hard book to finish but fans like myself will finish it regardless. This is not one of the best by VH, and she does have some keepers."
4,Great chemistry - a little bit of an unrealistic plot.,"Come on! What grown man is going to mistake a female for a male?! I don't care if she cut her hair, put on pants, and lowered her voice an octave. Any reasonable human being is never going to believe that a beautiful young woman is a man.This leads me to my next gripe. Antonia was WAY too young for this situation. She is seduced and sexually experienced before her 17th birthday! Call me naive and a bit narrow minded, but that's kind of disturbing. Especially when the seducer is a man over 30. Yuck.Other than those two points, this was a good book. The steaminess was good and the dialogue was good. Not my favorite, but definitely not the worst out there."
1,BORING STORY THAT WENT ON FOREVER!!!,"I was so disappointed with this book. The story just dragged on and on and on.... It's just so slow paced and makes you want to skip a lot of pages which I did. I read the first chapter, the middle one and the last one. I finished the book in 30 minutes and then returned it to the bookstore. Thank god they gave me back my money. This book is definitely not a keeper."
5,Grew to be a favorite over time,"I originally bought this book over 11 years ago and thought it was very good, but not the best Henley novel published. As I grew older and reread it 2... ok umm 4 times over the years it became one of my absolute favorites.Yes, the characters do take a while to get together, but I don't think that is such a bad thing. After almost 20 years of reading romance novels a person becomes a little sick of reading ""hey, shes hot.... therefore I must have her."" they have sex and fall instantly in love at first site. It is nice to feel at the end of a story that a couple is truly in love despite all their problems.I highly recommend this book and any other Henley book to anyone. Henley is the first author to make a fan of me, and after all of these years she still gets me after all that I've read."
2,"Storyline was different, BUT...","Antonia's mother was Adam Savage's mistress in Ceylon, and he had been planning on marrying her! Like a coward, he had planned to hide that news from her, and she never would have found out if her mother hadn't told her. Am I the only one around here who finds that a bit difficult to handle? I have to admit the story was intriguing, but I just couldn't get beyond the incestuous overtones. Personally speaking, I shudder at the thought of marrying my mother's ex-lover!"
4,Negotiation Basics and Beyond!,"Peter Stark takes common sense and turns it into ""common practice."" Just knowing a technique is not enough -- you need good examples and you need to learn how to counter tactics when used against you. This is both a good review of negotiation skills, as well as a primer for those who are negotiating for the first time. Check this book out -- your only disappointment will be in not using the suggested strategies."
5,Very handy book,"This is a very useful book in many aspects: it's easy to read, interesting to read and it's easy to adopt the learned practices in real, daily situations. Regardless of who you are and what are you doing, in business or just trying to do better in personal life, this book could help, if only you have enough self-confidence and willingness to try.Pham Thi Cuc HaMarketing ManageriSphere Software Ltd.,Hanoi, Vietnam"
2,Only the first 100 pages are useful,"Don't be a win at all costs Shark or a bottom feeding pushover Carp, but be a cooperative win-win Dolphin....this is the thesis which this book is based on. I don't think it offers much value.The last 100 pages are dedicated to hypothetical negotiation situations and the canned responses one ought to give. Most of it is common sense. For example, when someone gives you an ultimatum, you should counter it by postponement and hope the other side changes their mind. I wouldn't exactly call that negotiation astuteness, but it doesn't cause harm either."
5,A Great Way To Get Liver Into Your System,"I actually prefer using the powder form of liver than taking the pills. I use it in my morning pre workout smoothie in combination with cacao powder, maca, banana, peanut butter and milk. It blends in perfectly and with the cacao in there you barely taste the liver. I've taken it with Green SuperFood and that is actually quite harsh but I feel good taking the stuff. I think the combination of liver powder, maca, and cacao are a homerun for energy. They have other benefits, but I've felt it most in the energy arena."
5,"As advertised, great supplement!","I commend NOW Foods for this Liver Powder / whole food supplement! A good deal more potent than liver tablets by Beverly International, or other liver tablet brands out there.I use it for bodybuilding, and notice a distinct increase in muscle volume & weight after supplementing with this post workout. I believe the vitamin A in this fresh source is also more active, helping me stare at the computer screen long into the night."
3,"Dog treats, eh?","So another reviewer wrote that they use the powder to make treats for Fido. How appropriate, because if I ever tasted Alpo, I would taste just like this liver powder.Now don't get me wrong. First off, I am not a nutritional expert, nor do I claim to be one. According to everything else I read, I have NO doubt that this stuff is super nutritious and gives you all sorts of protein, amino acids and B vitamins, as the label describes. However, the price you pay for the taste of what you ingest just seems to be way too high.If you are looking for an argentine beef liver supplement you might want to go check out Universal's Uni-Liver Uni-Liver - 500 - Tablet. While they are large pills and some have found them hard to swallow, they are a LOT easier to swallow than this stuff.Loses two stars for horrific taste. Keeps three stars for being the ""steroid"" of choice for 1950s bodybuilders, back before the true anabolic enhancements existed."
4,Great dog biscuits,It makes great tasting dog biscuits . I don't know what else people do with it but the dog goes gaga over the liver powder flavored treats we make.
5,heh,"Well, its pretty dang good for an extension cord, 8ft long, and most are 6ft long. Well, uhhhh, just an extension cord, not much to talk about, just lets you play your gamecube up to 8ft longer, a total of 14ft! Great for parties!Dannyboy =)"
4,Ocean Oasis,As a scuba diver I enjoyed this video. Makes me want to get back into the water soon! Very well done.
2,Dimention/measurement problems,"I had bad luck with aquiring a FRAM FILTER thru AMAZON---- I needed to purchase by SIZE, and not by the ""normal, enter you vehicle"" way...THis is because I need it for a 1965 dodge Coronet, which doen't have the factory engine in it, with an after-market air cleaner set up..So knowing the size I needed, by MEASUREMENT, I sifted thru them, using AMAZON's dimentions listed with each....narrowed it down, again, by actual measements of the item. I wanted a 14"" by 5""..so I orderd one that was supposed to be like "" 14.5 by 5.3 ""...what I received was a filter that was like "" 7"" by 2.5"" WAY OFF...called it in, they tried again, and the same thing happened...... SO,YOU CANNOT GO BY THE MEASUREMENTS!!!!! Not sure how accurate the ""Enter Your Vehicle"" thing is..........."
3,Works OK.,"Only been using it for a few weeks. Seems to help a little, but it's not a miracle cure for thinning hair. Use in combination with a hair laser, Propecia, and Rogaine for best results."
3,"Wolfgang Puck's Pizza, Pasta, and More!","As always, Puck gives us clever and innovative recipes, but this time they're better suited to professional chefs and restaurant budgets. I particularly point to recipes like the one for balsamic shallots which calls for a whole pound of shallots and one-and-a-half cups of balsamic vinegar. That much supermarket balsamic vinegar would be harsh and unpalatable, while a decently-aged balsamic from a specialty shop would take this dish, just a side dish after all, out of range for the average budget.Also, I don't think his testing team did a thorough job. I found several errors, obvious to me because I'm a professional too. Regardless of these points, I think Puck is a terrific chef and teacher, although he just may have lost touch with what people will cook at home as opposed to what they would rather eat in a restaurant."
5,"Puck is a master, and this book proves it!","Wolfgang Puck's skills as a chef and restauranteur are well established, but with this cookbook he joins the select group of food professionals (like Perla Meyer, Caprial Pence, and Alice Waters) whose knowledge translates beautifully into recipes a home chef can prepare readily. The recipes are not only well thought out and obviously thoroughly tested under home kitchen conditions, but the mix of flavors and textures is sublime. Puck's sensitivity to his ingriedients and his innovative flair for marrying ingriedients stand out: the dishes are exciting to eat and easy to prepare.We've prepared probably 20 or more of the recipes in this book so far, and we find it perfect for those evenings when you want something pretty wonderful for dinner but you're played out from a hard day at the office."
5,"Wolfgang Puck's Pizza, Pasta and More!","Delicious recipes. I would recommend this cookbook for any fan of his cuisine. We go to his restaurant at the MGM whenever we're in Vegas and love the gnocchi's, but my son can eat two (or three)orders at one sitting! At $22.00 a plate, this can get expensive. Now I can make them myself for a fraction of the cost."
1,save your money!,"I have gambled in Vegas for 30 years, and read many a book from alleged experts. Save your money on this book. About the only advice this book gives that is worth anything is to bet more when winning. Otherwise, only very green beginners will find anything of worth in this book. I gave it one star because it has a great title. But, that's about all it has."
2,A Primer for Advantage Play,"Although I am giving this book 2 stars, it's not a ""bad"" book. It is for a person who likes Craps Or Blackjack and wants to be a winner more often, but does not yet know advantage play techniques. This book will ensure you know what your doing while playing craps or blackjack and give you and introduction into ways to improve your play.He uses the Imperial II count for blackjack, it's a simple card counting system, the downside is that he does not really get into it in depth.As far as Craps goes, there really is no innovation, he explains the different types of Good bets to make you money. He just doesn't get into a comprehensive system which I was hoping for."
4,"Sleek, Simple, and Silly","This is an excellent product and arrived very quickly. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of five stars is because the pen is suspended above the post-its. When one removes a post-it for use the pen will fall off/over unless previously removed. Still quite good, though."
1,Unstable,"The DWA-542 is simple to install and set up, but the software is really unstable. My Dell Dimension 8300 (3.20GHz Pentium 4; 1.5GB RAM) locks up at random times with the D-Link installed. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why it freezes the computer; it just lets me down every time. Sometimes it freezes on reboot; other times it locks up after a few minutes.I'd avoid this product until they get the bugs ironed out."
1,Can't get it going!,"I am very disappointed with this wireless adapter. I installed it per the instructions, and have not yet been able to get it connected!! I downloaded version 2.2 driver--still not luck. I do not plan to play around with this anymore, but will strongly recommend against anyone buying it.HBrown"
3,O.K. for a start,"If you have any prior experience with windows, get another book! Provides a good overview of Windows XP but no real depth. I will only recommend this book to anyone who has never used Windows before. For them, it is a great book! For me, it was a waste of time. Thats why I'm giving it a 3."
3,A good book for novice users,"This is a very good book for novice Windows users. Experienced users who are looking for something more in depth may be disappointed. The book covered very basic concepts, most of which are quite instinctive to experienced Windows users of previous versions. It does not have much coverage on more technical topics such as networking or security."
2,Rent it first!,"This game wasn't really the best. It may strike arcade fans, although it didn't strike me. I was thoroughly disappointed in the game when I played it the first time. Cardboard enemies, and no fun gameplay, are the high points. I really didn't like the game, and neither will much of anyone else."
2,Parents of middle-age kids: Listen up!,"Pros: The game is EXTREMELY easy, it took me 15 minutes to beat it,yes really!you only have to shoot the bad guys onceCons: You do not move around-it does it automaticallyThe clock keeps ticking even after you have killed all the enemies in your area.And here's one that came to my attention: the game cusses and it dosent say anything aout itin the ESRB ratingAll in all I think it should be rated M!"

1,a rant disguised as a book,"Ms. Law is shocked--shocked!--that some people may have wanted to challenge laws criminalizing private sexual behavior. She conveniently ignores that truth that many important cases, including the case that decriminalized birth control in 1965, are actively sought.Whether the Lawrence case was deliberately created is completely uninteresting, and her ""proof"" of this is pretty poor. Much more important is the way Ms. Law hysterically predicts the end of civilization as we know it--merely because consenting adults are ""given"" the right to pleasure each other as they wish.Supreme Court Justice Scalia said the same thing in his dissent. Both of them are telling us much more about the frightening, guilt-ridden world in which they live than they are telling us about U.S. jurisprudence."

3,Tank Battles of the Middle East Vol. 1,"Lots of excellent black and white pictures, but little actual information on the vehicles in question. The color plates are attractive, with detailed information on the subject's markings."
4,Tank Battles of the Middle East 1948-73,Very educational and a great reference for IDF Armor. A good companion book toTank Battles of Mid East Wars 7008. Only complaint is insufficient coverage of early M-1 and M-50 Shermans which were the backbone of the IDF for many years.
2,Battles without Maps,"The majority of the book contains photographs of the vehicles used. I was really looking for a fuller explanation of the overall strategy, wished to see the combatants positions as the battles unfolded, and hoped there would be more maps (there were none)."
2,unecessarily technical - real work to get through,"Though this book dealt with all the right issues, it was so fogged with psycho-techno-terminology, one has the sense it is written for professionals rather than parents. Though I am an educated person, I found this book to be very off-putting, where I'm sure it was intended to be warm and helpful. I can't recommend this, I'm afraid."
1,no instructions- product is useless- it will be returned,"Purchased two ""collapsible racks"".They came with no instructions. The phone number for execusystems has been either ""disconnected or is out of service""For assembly of the racks it would ""appear"" that you just lift the two side arms and put the cross bar in place, however the side arms are limited by 4 hex screws on the bottom. If the screws are in place the side arms do not move to a vertical position. If the screws are out the bottom rails move out of place.Using the screws as shipped the side arms cannot be raised high enough to allow the cross bar to be installed.Without some simple note regarding the adjustment of position of the hex screws the product cannot be brought to an assembled position.If this company is legit, I will return these to the company for a refund, however with no number to call and no customer support given, I may be forced to mail this ""brick"" back to Amazon."
5,wow factor,wow these are so sturdy and made so well very impressed with these i bought two daughter bought one and friend bought three cant find these in any store very commercial grade and easy to put together no tools and if you want folds flat for transport what a deal great rack and very great price im a satified customer and would advise anyone who needs a rack for hanging stuff to buy these u cant go wrong and the stuff they have in like target walmart kohls etc you name the store is JUNK compared to these lets face it if you have more than 250 pounds to hang up you have more than you need have a yard sale lol lol honestly i just love these my daughter has big parties in cool weather and holidays and this is so handy for all the coats n when party is over fold and store away if u like. you will get a lifetime of use out of these and then some. very very impressed with these. thanks for offering such good quality and great price what a deal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great quality,I wanted a rack that would be sturdy and would last. So I avoided the cheap products found in most stores and bought this rack based on the reviews I read here. The rack arrived in just a few days and set up was easy. I am very happy with my choice and am considering buying another one for the laundry room.
5,Great clothing rack!,I bought this for my elderly Mother to use to keep her clothing closer to the bathroom she uses. We had a cheap rack I bought at a discount store that would not hold what was required without falling apart. This new rack I bought from Amazon was a joy. It holds everything she throws at it and has great mobility. I love that it folds down should we ever need it to and the pull out ends are nice too. I wish I had bought one for myself also.
5,As great as all the reviews,"I have been using this as a temporary closet for the last few months. It works great, it is sturdy, reasonably priced. I am glad that it collapses easily so I can store it when I don't need it. I highly recommend it."
4,Clothes rack excellent,Received this clothes rack quickly. Easy to assemble. My wife had it put together in minutes. Very strong and perfect For the job. Great item for storing clothes in off season. Recommended
5,The BEST,"These racks were not really cheap by the time I ordered four of them and paid shipping. However, they are the best! They took me two minutes to figure out how to assemble them -- and the same two to do so. They are very sturdy, and I even hung a second rack from them to hang blouses. We are moving from a very large home to a very small one (with almost no closet space), so these racks work perfectly to store the clothes that I could not part with. And then my husband decided that he wanted one too. So, with too little time left to order another from Amazon, I purchased another rack just yesterday at a large local retailer -- and was so dismayed when I opened it and 200 screws and nuts fell out that iI just left it in the basement -- and this one was tinny to begin with. The moral of the story is that you should order and extra one in the first place.Every penny you invest in these racks is worth it!"
5,Buy THIS one!!!,"I bought this clothes rack to hang a ""LOT"" of spring and winter coats, jackets and sweaters! All these items have quickly colapsed a cheaper rack sitting still, let alone trying to roll the rack to get to other stuff in my basement. Very stable when moving rack EVEN with all of the weight on it. This rack now has 51 coats and jackets on it and is completely capable of more if there was room on the rack. Adjustable heighth and length with the pullouts is also a ""very"" nice touch. It rolls ""easily"" around on any floor with the large casters on this unit. Rack assembled very quickly by myself! Gotta be ""Amazons"" best clothes rack seller!!!! Very quick delivery also. I only waited 3 weeks to order another one thru AMAZON.... SURE DID OPEN UP SOME CLOSET SPACE ON THE MAIN FLOOR!!! We LOVE it,,,,"
5,EXCELLENT INSTANT CLOSET!,"This took less than 2 minutes to unfold and put together (the top rack is the only piece you need to set in), no tools required. It took longer to open the cardboard box than to set it up! Hung a TON of clothes on it (I am a clothes junkie) and the rack didn't budge, bend or bow, like my metal shower curtain rod was. . .LOL. (Now I can finally use my bathtub again!) Very happy! It also has good bumpers on the bottom edges so it doesn't mark up your wall (since it is on rollers), which is nice. It was definitely worth the 72.00 to get another ""instant closet"". Am debating whether to get another. . .a MUST HAVE for all the fashionistas out there whose closets are perennially stuffed full."
5,Clothes Racks,"Needed a place to hang clothes to avoid packing & storing clothing while caring for my elderly parents. Good, Sturdy and well worth the price."
1,Broken Wheel,Rack came with a broken wheel. I didn't unpack it until I arrived at my customer's store. Fortunately I had an extra wheel from last rack and was able to do a quick jimmy rig.
5,Heavy Duty Clothing Rack,"If you are looking for a heavy duty garment rack, this is it. I purchased the first one to free up closet space and I just had to get a second one for guests. I hosted a party and did not have to worry about the rack falling apart or tilting to one side. Easy access for everyone coming and going. When not in use it folds away nicely."
4,"great product, strong & easy to set up & down.","great product. Strong built, easy to set up & take down for nice storage when not in use. Large wheels. love it."
3,It works,"It's lighter duty than I was expecting. It will do the job I hope, we'll have to wait and see."
3,Sturdy but wonky wheels,"I'm impressed with the weight and sturdiness of this rack, it holds up heavy fur and wool coats with aplomb, but I'm disappointed in the casters/wheels. The cart I received has a mind of its own when rolling due to sticky (?) wheels and/or possibly a frame that is not quite plumb. I hope it is something I can fix with a little WD-40. Like with other commenters, the box arrived covered in tape, but the product inside seem none the worse (maybe the better?) for it."
5,As described,"It came faster than expected and was exactly as described. Easy to set up for my party and afterwards, easy to collapse and roll under a bed for storage."
5,Awesome!!!!!,"Item exactly as described. Strong construction, has held up to numerous winter coats and extra clothes. I would definately buy again! The rack was received in less than a week. It was super easy to put together, no special tools needed. In fact, it took 5 minutes to ""assemble"". It folds up nicely and fits easily into to the back of my car."
5,"wonderful, exceeded my expectations","After years of cheap racks that fell if I put more than one item on it, I finally splurged on this one. Super easy to set up, quick shipping and it exceeds all my expectations. Even a ""can't screw a nail into a hole"" dummy like me found it easy to set up. Holds a ton of clothes, rolls easily, you can even lay things across it until you hang it up and amazing - it still stands. No swaying and is sturdy. As soon as I get a few more cents I'm going to purchase more. I have tons of clothing, this makes it easier to move my out of season stuff out of the way."
5,Great Rack!,I purchased this rack through Amazon on Sunday. It was delivered by Weds. This rack was easy to assemble and strong. Forget anything you can buy at box store of home improvement store. Those cheap plastic racks will not compare to this commercial-grade rack. I am glad I got the real deal that can support all everything I can hang on it.
5,Top of the Line,"If you need a clothing rack look no further, spend a few more dollars and be happy for many years to come. The cheaper one are flaky and break easily. Do yourself a favor, splurge and be happy."
3,"Good movie, bad packaging","it's a very good movie that i have been longing for a copy of it for many years, but the cover of the box is kind of fake and cheap, but overall, the movie is good."
4,Hell grows on you,"When I first stumbled on this project the audacity of it took me aback. But after reading it, I've come to see the real power of it lies not in the drawings, but in the combination one-two punch of the text and the images. While the text is at once faithful to Dante's original and at the same time brash and a bit irreverent, the images setting this classic in contemporary urban American wastelands give it new depth. The combination of the two reshapes the classic into something new - a bold, new commentary on our times and the role religion has in it. Very good."
2,not that interesting,"The book itself arrived in great shape and there was nothing physically wrong with it. I did not like the story itself, so that's why I gave it this rating. I have since donated this to a cosignment store."
4,Good but no sub for the real thing,A good summary of the full Catechism but a little cooked down in some places. Includes interesting stories of servants of God at the beginning of each chapter.
2,Simplistic,The Catholic Catechism for Adults treats thinking adults as children. The catechism is really basic and simplistic. I recommend the Catechism of the Catholic Church for a much more nuanced treatment of theology.
5,It was perfect,I ordered this book to use while taking my confirmation class. It was perfect. The homily in the beginning of each chapter really helped to set the tone.
5,Review on Cathechist,This is an awesome book if you want to learn about the Catholic faith. A lot of great stories and history about the Catholic church. A great asset to anyone's library.
3,Good for RCIA,"I used this book last year for an R.C.I.A. class. The students found it easy to understand. I would assign a chapter each week and would discuss what was read at the next class. I would recommend this book as a ""springboard"" into a rich and deep discussion of the Catholic faith with intelligent and question adults. If you are look for an in depth theology behind the creeds and beliefs this is not the book for you."
3,"Problem with text organization, numbering of points",Actually the book is fine and in good condition but the Bible Study class I'm taking requires a version which has a system of numbering important points in each paragraph which are instrumental in following the class text therefore I had to buy another catechism locally to stay with the group and have to return this version.
5,Every Catholic should have a copy of the Catechism,I just started to read the catechism. I like the heritage it gives of our countries catholics. I'm looking forward to reading our laws and beliefs. Out faith never changes. I love my faith and the closeness it brought me to God.
4,PRODUCT AS ADVERTISED,"PRODUCT AS REPRESENTED, WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS. INFORMATIVE AND EDUCATIONAL . EASY READING . WILL SHARE WITH OTHERS IN TIME"
4,A very good amount of information for catechesis.,The United States Bishops provided a very good and informational guide to understanding our Catholic Faith. Good backup for the RCIA.
4,Catechism - Second Try,"Reasonably well written and simple compared with the regular Catholic Catechism which I have used in R.C.I. A. and Adult Conformation classes. I use the CCC (Cathechism of the Catholic Church) in my classes and my students find that resource very useful and like its authority. This ""second"" edition has also been useful lately for my students to read on the more complex issues of the Catholic faith. Sometimes the CCC is so technically accurate that students of the faith find the wording too difficult. I believe it is important that candidates become comfortable with our doctrines. The Adult Catechism is often much clearer. In the future I will use both texts."
4,a necessity,"this is a necessity for anyone going through the RCIA. If you don't have the time to read the Catechism, perhaps having it read to you would help."
2,Not for Catholics,"This is a great book for anyone who is not catholic or has no religious background. If you are catholic and actually go to Church, you will find this book useless. Most of this information is basic knowledge that you would or should already know. If you are just catholic by birth and never practiced or went to church, you will find the book extremely helpful."
4,Very Good,"This catechism is being used for a sixteen week Catholic Catechism for Adults series at Most Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in Toledo, Ohio. The speakers (our Monsignor, Deacons, and Seminarian) are going through the chapters and expanding on what is written. Many things in the Catholic faith that are being explained are very enlightening. I am a ""cradle Catholic""; however, what I learned throughout twelve years of Catholic school doesn't come close to all there is to know. I plan to read the catechism cover to cover following this program."
5,"Another ""Can't Put it Down"" sequel to ""MEG""","Mr. Alten does it again. Another thriller just as good as his first book ""Meg"". I read it in 4 days, able only to read at night. The author is a master storyteller. I can't wait for this one to be made into a movie!"
5,The Trench,"This book is a must read, terrorfing book that will keep you on your seat until the final page."
5,Deep sea fishing,"Don't go deep sea fishing on something smaller than an aircraft carrier ever again, that is a fact."
5,THe MEGA GREAT WHITE,"I thought this book was totally amazing It is the megalosequel to MEG and I think that this book is better than meg The shark in MEG was 60 feet long and the shark in the Trench is 72 feet long I liked it when the gigantic shark attacked whales and when it grabbed that helicopter and alomst brought it down. It was really amazing when Angel attacked the KRONOSAURUS that was about to devour JONAS AND TERRY. I would give this book 10 stars. I think that the megalodon is totally unstoppable I have read about giant megalodons bigger than Angel that have might made strange appearances in remote places of the oceans. but even a 72 foot long shark is powerful enough to rule the oceans the sharks I read about were of course more powerful and more terrifying than angel. AnYWAYS i think that The TRENCh and MEg, and Extinct are just totally awesome there is no creature that is going to challenge a MEGALODON."
5,great price and arived early,"i was surprised to find the book in my mailbox this morning, thought it would not come till around the 9th. the book looks great and for the price, it makes for a great extra gift, i am sure my mother will enjoy it this xmas."
3,Too predictable,"Even though I found this story much more enjoyable and the writing style more palatable than the first one, the story was far too predictable, including the ending. I have visions of this series going on and on with similar endings in all the books just so the opportunity is there for yet another sequel. You can only eat so many people, and destroy so many ships before I start to yawn...too much of the same in my opinion."
4,Great,"Great follow up to meg. i loved it almost as much as the first one. i think this book help prove the fact that even the newest writers of the world can write a sequal without it looking like a copy of the first one. 100% fresh new ideas! P.S. I LOVED the idea of Kronosaurus, now there even more danger."
3,The Trench is kind of like salty pretzels at the bar . . .,". . . in that you know you shouldn't be eating so many but gosh, you look up and you've eaten the whole bowl.Can't say it was of Crichton quality or anything but gosh if I didn't read the whole damn thing in one sitting.Loved the way the know-it-all in the first chapter was named after Richard Ellis who gave 'Meg' such a scathing review. Nice poke, Steve...I laughed out loud. Anybody notice any others I missed?"
2,"Better than Meg, but.....","Maybe two and a half stars. This book was an improvement on ""Meg."" The writing style is a bit better, and the plot was more complex. However, ""Meg"" was so badly written that this isn't saying much.Now that he's figured out how to plot, maybe Alten should work on character development. Clearly, we were supposed to care deeply about what happens to Jonas and Terry. I didn't care one bit. And these are holdover characters from the first book! He did his best development with the bad guys. And we all know what happens to the bad guys in Alten's books.The bits about the sharks and other sea creatures were interesting, and will most likely induce me to read another installment. I have to admit, I'll be taking it out of the library. There's just not enough here to make me want to purchase even a paperback copy."
1,Last gasp from a would-be writer,"Basically a slightly more polished version of the dreadful Meg. If English is your 3rd or 4th language and you have little grasp of it, or you are a comic book reader, or pro wrestling fan you'll love this. After Doubleday took a big loss on Meg they dumped this turkey of a sequel. But without all the hype and promotion of a major publishing house it will be interesting to see if this is Alten's last gasp. Probably, time to pick up the basketball pal."
1,4 1/2 stars??! You're all nuts,"I couldn't even finish this poor sequel to ""Meg"".I got turned on to Steve Alten when I read the fantastic ""Domain"", and proceeded to read ""Meg"". Well, ""Meg"" was enjoyable (3 stars) yet extremely silly. I was able to swallow alot of nonsense due to the neat ideas and fast pace which Alten delivered during it's pages. THIS novel, however, is pointless.Sure, the pacing is quick but it costs the reader a coherent STORY. I felt like I was reading the screenplay for a bad direct-to-video movie. I can't begin to describe how weak the storytelling is here. I don't like to use the word ""hack"" when it comes to describing writers, but with this sorry novel Alten almost earns that crown. Honestly, if it hadn't been for his stellar performance on ""Domain"" I would never consider reading another Steve Alten novel."
3,"Not yo daddy's shark fiction, not quite mine either","For those who were in love with shark fiction and Steve Alten's sleek genre piece MEG, the TRENCH, no matter what you think of Alten's shortcomings, is manditory reading.I can't say that this book was really a disappointment (seeing Alten's faults in MEG, is was inevitable that success would blow them out of proportion in TRENCH) but then again, I was at the rather undemanding age of 13 when I first read it.Not only is the human fiction in this book wildly pretentious, most of it is unneccessary and distacting. Also not very pleasantThe shark attacks, however, still ring true and will satisfy our lust for carnage. Rather than building tension, Alten perfers to bash us repeatedly with shark mayhem, which is fine by my, if i didn't have to read so much ill-written ""human"" drama in between. Hopefully Primal Waters will be a more mature and focused book."
2,Jaws 5,"I love shark stories, for light reading they are always fun. This story is okay but Alten writes like an amateur. Instant character delvelopment, rushed dialog and way too many cliques. ""He thought of Terry, and his heart ached for her. He tried to recall the last time they had laughed together...."" I guess I'm just mad because I paid full price for the book and I was looking forward to a fun read but the poor writing distracts beyond enjoyment."
4,"Very Entertaining, Much Better Than I Had Even Hoped!","First off, let me say, I didn't have much hope for this book. ""Meg"" I didn't read. I remember looking at the back and thinking ""Wow a book about a shark that eats alot of people, Original!"" Then when my father in law gave me The Trench I thought ""Wow Jaws II. The baby is back and She's pissed. How totally original"". But how WRONG I was!! This book was VERY entertaining, moves fast, lots of action, plenty of good guys and bad guys (and girls!). Would make a fine movie. Well worth the read. Enjoy!"
1,It blew my mind like a hurricane over a sewage plant!!!!!!!!,"In a class by itself. The trench draws on the same well of creative genius and originality that Vanilla Ice and Milli Vanilli have mined with such success. Has any one ever heard a giant shark story before? Gee, it seems somehow familiar, don't it. Kudos to Mr. Alten!"
1,been done,"Nice monster, moderate suspense, but it's been done. Sharks, whoopty-doo! Seventy feet? Wow that's that's uh, that's real big I'm sure. The bottom line is, Megaladon, as countless people seem to beleive (due to films and books like this), is not the largest, most powerful predator the world has ever seen. That would be LIOPLEURODON. At eighty feet long and weighing one hundred and fifty tons, it would make a snack out of the Megaladon sharks (who only grew to about sixty feet inlength). Liopleurodon was not only larger and stronger, it was probably smarter, I'm talking killer whale intelligence. All you have to do to imagine this guy is combine a crocodile and a killer whale, boost it's size up (waaaay up), give it a sixteen foot long skull, and you've got it. I'm extremely surprised no one has written a book about this true king of the deep. The good thing about this book is that it did involve a Kronosaurus, a smaller and less impressive cousin of Liopleurodon, in it's story."
3,Prehistoric shark,There were some unexpected things that kept the suspense up. This book will hold your attention but it's a little long. Mac is a great character.
2,"JUST ANOTHER ""JAWS"" SHODDY REMAKE","PROBABLY ONE OF HE WORST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ. THE PLOT WAS PREDICTABLE WITH A HUGE, KILLER SHARK ON THE LOOSE. STEVE ALTEN HAS SOME INTERESTING IDEAS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN THE ABYSS COMBINED WITH THE WHOLE EVOLUTION CONCEPT. HOWEVER, I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO SAY A LITTLE TOO MUCH IN THIS BOOK. THE STORYLINE WAS VERY CHOPPY WHICH MADE FOR A RATHER BORING READ."
5,Great read!,"Anyone who enjoyed Meg will find that Mr. Alten has exceeded expectations. Rarely is a sequel better than the original, but in this case the author has accomplished that rare feat."
3,The Trench,"Very entertaining read, a real nice beach book. In my opinion the best book of the Meg series."
3,Summer reading material,"Maybe the heat is frying my brain, but after re-reading this book, I started liking it more. Look, it's not serious literature from Ian McEwan or Cormac McCarthy. It's simply a mindlessly fun summer read about a prehistoric shark who escapes from a California aquarium and feeds on whales, other sharks, and humans. The protagonists from 'Meg' are back with some new cardboard human villians who serve the purpose of making the shark look good. Throw in some long-presumed-dead marine reptiles who live in the Marianas Trench, and you've got a beach read."
2,"I believe the Australian colloquial expression is ""bl***y awful""...","It does have the advantage that it's slightly better than ""Primal Blather"", or whatever the most recent one's called. It gets two stars, only because I'm a sucker for deep ocean tales, and there's some interesting stuff there. Mind you, the prehistoric deep-sea dragons were a bit of a joke - well, the whole thing is a bit of a joke, and it must be hilarious to Mr. Alten, with ourselves as the butt thereof for buying this tosh. Never again (well, yes, OK, I said that last time too, but I have reformed, really, I have...I am cured, Hallelujah!). I shall NOT buy Meg Mk.IV when it comes out (allegedly at the same time as the much-stalled film of Meg Mk.I)."
5,Quick moving heart stopping book,As a Jaws fan I am always in search of new shark books. Trench is good book for any shark fan. This book moves quickly and the excitment doesn't stop till the end.
4,Not all sequels suck.....,"THE TRENCH proves that not all sequels suck. A sequel to MEG (released 2 summers ago), THE TRENCH improves on the original in every way. The story telling is tighter, the main characters get more developed (though Mac needs more story time), and the ending is much more satisfying. Though I thought MEG was entertaining, I did have a few (minor) problems with it. Thankfully this sequel is better in every way. Maybe some day that movie version of MEG will get made just so we can see the finale of THE TRENCH appear on screen."
3,Can't be as charitable as the rest of you...,"I have been anxiously waiting for Trench for months, way back when it was going to be published as Fathom. I was disappointed. True, there was lots of shark action and the story line was interesting and woven with sub-plots which kept my interest up. But, I found the sexual inuendo and references gratuitous and somehow out of place. I felt it unnecessary and distracting in this book. However, I am still an Alten fan. Best beach books I have ever read (except for Clive Cussler!!!!!!!)"
3,Very grabbing for the first 309 pages.,"As the title says, it is very interesting to read for the first 309 pages. Unfortunately it becomes so unrealistic after that that the ending was not as satisfactory as I was hoping for. Still most of the book is good and as a first writing effort it is not bad at all. Just because I did not consider the ending realistic does not mean that I won't read the Trench. I'd like to think that the author has learned and evolved. So I will definitely read the follow up book some time."
4,Spine tingling terror.... it was good.,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It picked up where the book Meg left off.. I throughly enjoyed it.
5,"Angel, Bad Girl",The story is great. You never know from one minute to the next just exactly what the people keeping Angel are going to encounter. I started reading and couldn't put the book down. Can you imagine going down 7 feet in the ocean in one of those little subs? The fear and anxiety they encountered was real. I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel.
1,bad book,"First off I'd like to say that 1 star is far too gracious for Alten's gravest failure. This author made a substantial effort in trying to write a ""so called"" novel. This book was a complete and total blunder. I scorn Alten in his worst hour for this sorry excuse for a book. In this utter failure for a book I have found my mental capacity to be greatly diminished. At no point in this book was I at all surprised by a fact I didn't know. Alten tells of a prehistoric beast of a shark who ravages through its binds at the Tanaka Institute only to slaughter hundreds. I will not give away the end of this book in fear that it will make you vomit. Alten's gross use of sexual content was utterly disgusting and blatantly insulting. I wish I would never have wasted my time money and effort in reading this god-awful monstrosity of a ""book."" May God have mercy on the reader's soul."
1,Badly written jaws rip-off fluff,"The first half of the book is defensively written, trying to make up for the countless hilarious mistakes in MEG. The result is a slightly better written yet somehow flat story. But as long as shows like Power Rangers and Tellytubbys(spelling?)make it to the market so will milktoast drivel like this. It is clear that the author's primary experience with the sea is gazing through the glass of a fish tank(probably with thumb in mouth). At least Cussler was a real diver. This ain't Shakespeare for sure, but it's not even up to Free Willy's low standard. Ellis Richard."
1,The Trench,"ONE GREAT UNANSWERED QUESTION: WHAT KIND OF WRITER CAN'T WRITE? I didn't read the end, or the middle, or much of the beginning. I felt, why should I bother reading if the writer didn't bother writing? By the way, I wasn't looking for literature. I brought the book on a vacation to Mexico. My intention was to read mindless crap. This didn't even rise to that expectation. Oh, well, maybe that's why it's called ""The Trench."""
4,A great follow up to MEG,"Steve Alten brought us to the depths of the ocean with MEG and now he brings all of it back once again with The Trench. When the Baby Meg that was in captivity escapes, the chase is on and it is more exciting than ever in this novel.This book is a great follow up not only because of the excitement it brings, but also because of its great character development. There is a new villain on the scene and it is not a Shark; rather a multi-millionaire named Singer. This adds so much more to this story.The same cast of characters is back and the action is still there. This is a great summer read, just don't read it at the beach!"
5,The Best Damn Shark Book I Ever Read,"When I first picked up this book I thought it was just one of those ""Im a big shark and I'll eat you"" But when I got in to it and then realized how intersting this book was going to be. The way Steve Alten but this book together was I would say was incrediable. I love the plot twist the suspense of not knowing whether Celest is a good or bad girl. Pretty much the only other thing I can say about this book is if you haven't read it go read it today."
4,great book-bad movie idea,"this book was great. i read it all in about 4 hours. but people, seriously, i've read all your reviews and there are just some things that look great on paper but you just cannot transfer them onto the big screen without it looking cheap or cheesy. i'll be first in line to see MEG when it comes out but i'm dreading having to watch them try to suffer their way through it. especially the final scene."
3,entertaining but not a masterpiece,"The Trench was pretty good. The plot tended to get a little elementary with twists that one could see from a mile away. The ending was a little hokey with all the fighting in 36000 feet of water. I know the book was a work of fiction but it was also supposed to have an underlying truth to it as well. As opposed to the first book, Meg, I personally thought that this book was written better and was more entertaining. I won't reveal the ending to the people who havent read the book yet, but I was more pleased with the ending in The Trench than with Meg."
3,3.5 stars really,"The sequel to MEG loses something as author Steve Alten adds [human] violence, sex, and a rediculous plot to control the world to make THE TRENCH more mainstream. Taking place several years after the events of MEG, which saw a female Carcaradon megalodon escaping from the ultra-deep Mariana Trench and eating lots of unsuspecting folks, we find our hero, Jonas Taylor, severely distraught after years of playing nursemaid to Angel, the captive daughter of the original Meg. Angel eventually escapes, and is chased by Jonas and his crazy copter pilot friend Mackriedes while they simaltaneously battle Big Corporate Baddies. Like MEG, TRENCH's shark scenes are terrifying (especially if you're scared of sharks in the first place), but the Evil Corporation plot that takes up the other half of the book is stupid, though enjoyable. Despite its shortcomings, I highly recommend both it and MEG."
3,"Good, not great","The first 100 pages are terrific -- exploring the intricacies of twinness and the effect of Orthodox Judaism on modern life. Then Jonathon disappears for most of the remainder of the book and the novel descends into a not terribly interesting family struggle. The parents (virtually ignored in the beginning) are then introduced with no background. From here on in the characters are merely plot devices. The book comes alive again at the ending when Jonathon makes his reappearance. I only wish the author had focused on the brothers' relationship, which is arguably the most interesting thing in the book."
5,What a wonderful book!,"This is definitely not for one segment of people, rather really hits issues that impacts many. The author is so descriptive and fills his words with feeling. As I read, I can picture what he writes.Thank you!"
3,"Good idea, mediocre execution","I enjoyed The Same Embrace; it wasn't, however, one of my favorite gay-oriented novels. I have to give Lowenthal credit for the originality of the story--twins, religion, and sexuality. I felt that the book concentrated too much on Jacob and not his twin brother. Jacob's recollection of the past, his interractions with his twin, were the best parts of the novel. I was led to believe that the novel would be a story about the two brothers from the title, but it really wasn't. I felt like I needed to know more about Jonathon, his thinking, his reasons for becoming orthodox, etc. And then the book ended. This book had so much potential to be a great novel!"
2,"Terrible the first time, but it almost grows on you","When I first read this book, I thought it was the worst thing I had ever read. But thinking it over, I realize it does have some good points, and I give Lowenthal credit for trying. I htink the thing that bothered me the most was the overuse of metaphors-and bad ones at that. The book is full of them! I agree with the other reviewer in that it should have been written in the first person. The third person pov takes this intensely personal story and makes it into a movie of the week sort of deal. You can't get into the characters heads, understand their motives. I also found the ending to be a little bit too neat and tidy. After hundreds of pages of arguments and strife, Jacob and Jonathan suddenly just patch things up with hardly any discussion or adressing the issues between them. Again, it's like a movie of the week. Lowenthal has a lot of potential-I hope he realizes it on his next work."
1,Pretentious,"There is no real story here. I'm tired of the pretensions of so much that is marketed as gay books-- as if ""gay"" has to equal ""literary."" The best books -- gay or straight -- tell good stories with characters you can relate to. We need more books that do this and not what ""Sam Embrace"" seems so earnestly trying to be: High ""Litrachure."""
2,It is an 8-1/2 x 11 inch pamphlet of black & white sketches!,"Unless the publisher has reprinted this item, I have it copywrite 1999 as a 60 page 8.5"" by 11"" pamphlet of house plans. They are black and white and about half of them are rough sketches. Floorplans often omit the second floor. I was hoping for more fanciful or outlandish designs, but they all seem to be very practical for families. Often two houses fit on one page. Many of the designs have blueprints you can order from the publisher/designer. The last half of the pamphlet has designs that look like they were drawn by hand in less than two minutes each (there must have been a deadline to get it to the printers!). Because of this quality of the so-called ""book"", I rate it 2 stars.If you like Fanciful Houses, I suggest you buy 'Storybook Style - America's Whimsical Homes of the Twenties' by Arrol Gellner & Douglas Keister."
1,"Great book, terrible book binding","This is not a review of the actually content, I think the material is superb and gives great incite into the change of perceived and real projection power of the Royal Navy and its influence on world events. This is a voicing of my frustration with the quality of the book binding. By the second day of reading this book it split in two, and by completion of reading it is in several sections. I have never had this happen with a new book and I am not sure if this is a systematic or isolated issue."
4,Sadly Underrated... Excellent Horror Film !,"Stuart Gordon's ""Castle Freak"" is a fun and creepy classic. I personally love this flick. The acting is well done, the story is quite a chiller and the ""Freak"" has got to be one of the most ghastly, realistc & underrated monsters within the world of horror films. There is a sprinkle of cheese on top of what is mostly a solid substance filled scary movie. I also enjoy the straight fowardness of it. What I mean is with Re-Animator we get zombies(not real) and with From Beyond we get fantasy horror(again not real) but with Castle Freak, although it has some illogical cheesy-ness mixed in, it also is very believable/conceivable that the going's on in this movie could really happen. A truly underrated fright flick!"
3,Not bad if you like cheesy horror,"Castle Freak is cheesy horror. If that is what you're into, then you will probably love this flick. Personally, I found myself laughing throughout the whole film. It really isn't that scary. The Freak eats a pet cat. But he has a soft spot for the blind daughter. The dialogue is so generic.If you want a laughable horror flick a la Leprechaun, then watch this. If you want a scare-your-pants-off The Shining type thriller, then give it a pass"
2,*blink* Where's the scary part?,"I must have blinked and missed it. Sure, it was gory in places, but the lead character was so clueless I wanted to slap him. Didn't even drop his pants for the sex scene! He and the prostitute did it standing up against a wall. Classy. I suppose Full Moon didn't pay Jeffrey Combs enough to give us the full monty."
4,A Classic Horror Flick,"Full Moon is really the most under-rated horror studio. This movie was famous enough to spawn a mass market toy of the monster. Great genre actor Jeffrey Combs and his family move into a gothic Italian castle, only to find inside there resides a hideous monster hungry for flesh. This is one of the better-known H.P. Lovecraft adaptions, and is similiar to the earlier movie Unnamable, though not as good. It is the same premise- the first scene is that of the monster being tormented and locked up, people come to the residence and get killed. A by-the-numbers slasher/monster movie that is one of Full Moon's best movies. Not essential viewing by any means, but any somewhat-dedicated horror fan who sees this will surely never forget it. This is based on the H.P. Lovecraft pulp ""The Outsider."""
2,Castle Freak (DVD),"Jeffrey Combs does his best to make this flick respectable, but in the end, it's just another monster movie. A little sex, nudity and violence (very little) make some scenes worth the price of admission, but they are brief and not well acted. Jessica Dollarhide (playing the blind daughter) could have saved the film, but she never even lost her bra, let alone her virtue. If you are REALLY into old ""B"" horror flicks, this one is a MUST. Otherwise, save your money."
3,A decent horror flick,From stuart gordan and jeffery combs comes castle freak.this movie isnt as bad as some the reveiws say.i thought it was good.the only thing is that it takes awhile for the veiwer to accually see the freak but once the killing and gore start its an enjoyable movie.jeffery combs plays his part with no dark humor which i thought was gonna suck but it wasnt bad.it shows that he dosent rely just on dark humor to make a good part.the freak looks absolutly UGLY and the make up was excellent on him.for the price its a good movie and its worth owning.give it a chance you might be surprised.
2,"ehhh, so so","I thought this movie was so so and you can yell and scream at me all you want Stuart Gordon fans but it aint better then Re-Animator which was the bomb diggidy. this one has of course Jeffrey Combs in it, hes good but the story and the shrieks and chills didnt add up to what it was supposed to be. for Gordon of Combs fans basically, others beware its bad taste."
3,"From the man who brought you ""The Re-animator""","Stuart Gordon presents another film adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft story. In this one ""Castle Freak"" John Reilly(Jeffrey Combs,The Re-animator series)his wife(Barbara Crampton,The Re-animator)and their blind daughter inheret a castle in Italy,from a relative who recently passed away. They also inhereted her son, who was chained up in the cellar, that they don't know about until, John brings home a prostitute and she is never seen again and he is accused of her murder. It's up to John to protect his family and prove his innocence. As you would expect there is plenty of creative gore, one scene is similair to one in Beyond Re-animator. If you enjoy the works of H.P.Lovecraft, STuart Gordon, or Jeffrey Combs you will enjoy this film others however should be causious about choosing whether or not they want to watch this."
3,Heard things!!!,"I personally have not had the privilege of viewing ""the Freak"" but I heard things. You may ask how much I think I will like it and I say lil bit Joey lil bit!!!"
5,Castle Freak kills them all!,"Hmmmmm, how can I describe the Castle Feak? the acting is horrible, the characters are about as shallow and nasty as the urine filled kid's pool, and the plot is utterly trite and contrived. Castle Freak rules! That crazy Castle Freak does all sorts of gory things for the pleasures of it's sick and twisted audience. There's this one part at the beginning where he bites his own thumb off, that's pretty cool. When the Castel freak escapes, zaniness insues. Yes, this movie is incredibly gory. In fact, that's all it's go going for it as an actual movie. but, for pure camp and shock value, you can't do much better than the Castle Freak. Recommended for anyone who has spent a lot of tiume locked away. Castle Freak eats a live cat too, that silly ol' Castle Freak."
1,Is this horror ??,"Well...don't know where to start......bought this one because it has Jeffrey Combs in it, Stuart Gorden is director.....and they did a good job on Re-animator.but let me tell you, horror freaks will be disapointed. Only one really bloody scene is worth watching...not because of the blood, not because of the gore.....just, because it is the only bloody scene in the movie...a nice looking woman is eaten by the ""castel freak"".....If you have seen Re-animator, The Evil dead, From Beyond, Hellraiser and maybe The Thing, then skip this one..you will be disapointed like me....Even a John Woo action movie has more blood in it....."
5,I feel bad for Castle Freak's tiny shriveled mansack,"First off, if your reading this then you have probably seen the movie, in which case you know of the awsomeness it reaks. Recomend it to your friend(s)! Also, I don't know why it is rated NC-17, nor do I know why the costumers of the movie chose not to conceal the Castle Freak's nads. Let me say that the closeup of them before he bit the hooker's boobie off was not necessary in the least. But in the end, when he was jumping around and they were flopping all over the place... well you get the point. Excellent movie."
2,Belt Clip Sucks!,"This case is attractive with all the right cutouts. Unfortunately, the belt clip is attached by a screw. It sits about 1.5 inches from the case, and doesn't lock into place. So if the phone is attached to your belt, it's just spinning in the wind! Not very dependable..."
4,Excellent musically--lacks conscious lyrics,"""After All"" is a great album! Musically it is superb; however, the lyrics tend not to be very conscious ,as they generally are on Luciano albums (I think someone else wrote the lyrics, but I'm not certain). If you're just looking for some good reggae in Luciano's style, give this album a listen, but if conscious lyrics are important to you try Luciano's ""Where There Is Life"" or ""Messenger""."
3,Doesn't work with larger lathes,"I bought this, thinking it would work on my Powermatic 3520. When it arrived, I realized that it was intended for a mini-lathe. This would have been a bery nice thing to put in the description of the product. The actual product is MUCH smaller than it appears on my computer screen."
3,dust shield,It funcations good enough but I have problems keeping it in the proper location using the magnetic mount.My shopsmith has to much aluminum on it so I had to mount it perminitly
3,Son was anxious to get this but a little disappointed,"My son saw this in a toy store and thought it looked really fun, so he finally just got it for his 7th birthday. When you stuff the parachute into the ball, and close the two halves of the ball, it feels like it's going to come apart before you even throw it into the air. It seems to hold together alright but it doesn't open until the ball is already half-way down, so you don't get much parachute flight. Overall, it's pretty good, but certainly not a must have, and my son hasn't pulled it back out since the first day."
4,Ken'l-Lan 128 product,"Ken'l-Lan is the same product I have been using for years only with a revised name. It is consistent with the product I am used to and I am satisfied with the product, the price and the speed with which it was delivered. Works well in the kennel and is non toxic to the dogs"
4,Authentic Americana,"Despite rumors to the contrary, The Rip Chords were not a ""front"" for Terry Melcher and Bruce Johnston, although their input was significant and they were/are brilliant producers. The Rip Chords (and especially ""Hey Little Cobra"") are examples of mid-century Americana, and millions agree that it is still great music. To over-intellectualize it would be doing it a great injustice. It was not recorded to make a statement, but to reflect the times, invoke fun and sell records, all of which it brilliantly accomplished. While The Rip Chords indeed owe much of their sound to the studio geniuses of the 60's L.A. scene, so do The Association, Grass Roots, Beach Boys, Jan & Dean, Mamas & Papas, Gary Lewis and countless other acts coming out of the L.A. scene at that time. That's just the way it was - and when you listen to all of this great music, aren't you glad?! Relax and enjoy the music!"
5,Great Car Memories and new experiences!,This album of well written and fine musical performances is a must for any muscle car fan.
5,Fun & Instructional,"I really enjoyed the book, it was fun and made me laugh. But more so than making me laugh, it also taught me. It taught me about running and how strange we runners can be. It also reminded me not to take myself too seriously as a runner.The chapters are short, making it an easy read! Whether you are a hard-core runner or a newbie (like me) you should enjoy it!"
3,Humorous,"Schwartz goes to great lengths to be funny, which gets a bit wearying before the end. The book was a gift, and I read much it, but not being a runner, I mostly skip-read to get a feel for the book. I wouldn't buy it again, but perhaps my sense of humor doesn't include running and extreme exaggeration."
3,Too much at once,Fast to read and funny stuff. However I prefer to read one story at once. Too much jokes about the same matter makes I Run... a bit boring. The solution: you should read 5 pages per week.
2,Worst book ever! Couldnt even finish it!,"First off, this book started off great. Laughed my butt off the first couple of chapters. Once you get about a quarter of the way into it, u get the sudden urge to want to punch the author for his incredibly annoying writing skills. Every single sentence started to become long and completely over analyzed. Totally reaching when it came to attempted humor. Ive read a lot of books on the lives of runners. Some were funny, some instructional, and some just stories on their lives. He attempted all 3, and failed miserably. Mr. Bob Shwartz needs to put that dictionary away because his attempt at sounding intelligent made him more or less sound like a moron. This book kind of reminds me of college days when writing a term paper consisted of an extreme amount of adjectives just to meet that certain page quota. Im thinking he should get an award for the most run on sentences within a chapter."
2,DOES NOT TEACH HOW TO MODEL.,"I bought this book thinking it was going to teach me how to model a Female Character...I WAS DEAD WRONG!!This book DOES NOT teach anything about modeling,the only thing it says to do is create a box and extrude following the sketch outline.The programs covered in this book are mainly Poser(50%) Maya(15%) and Photoshop(35%)..They should call this book ""How to pose and texture a character in Poser"" because that is really all this book tells you to do..But if you want a book full of pictures of nude 3D Models then by all means buy this book.."
1,Really Disappointed,"The number one reason why you shouldn't buy this is becasue there is nothing but one or two lessons per subject; and only one test. So, all you keep doing is retaking the same test over and over till you get it right. But, hey you get what you pay for, keep your money and invest in some other academic software."
1,Terrible dont waste your money,This software is junk. I can not believe they would even release this to sell it. This is proof that these software companies will throw junk at us and put a spicey cover on it just to make a quick buck. Skip this and high school advantage. If you want the best of the best go with academic fitness. That programs puts all the other ones to shame.
5,ONE OF THE BEST PHOTO-BOOKS OF FIRE ARMS ENGRAVING,"Having been a serrious engraver for just over a year now, I have amassed several books on engraving: mainly the ""standards"" for engravers: several of the Dover series of patterns, James L. Meek, Nimschke, etc. This has some of the finest and sharpest photos of engraving I have seen. And this book is cheap compaired to many of the others. Just plain beautiful. And --- worth every penny"
4,Another Coffee Table Book,"While done very well, like many other of his books, more about firearms few can afford to own. More for the collector of high-end guns."
2,More of a picture book,"Though the illustrations ARE lovely, the nursery rhymes are incomplete, shortened versions of the real thing. If you want a picture book, you can't go wrong with this one, but for the classic Mother Goose nursery rhymes, sadly, this book does not deliver."
3,Not a complete collection,"If you are looking for a nursery rhymes book that your child can read, then this is a good one. Otherwise, if you want a book to pass down to generations, this is a poor selection. This book only contains short clips of nursery rhymes - not the whole thing. If you are looking for a complete collection of a nursery rhymes book, keep looking, this is not the one."
1,Very Very Poor Book,STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!!! THESE ARE VERY DANGEROUS AND MISLEADING CONCEPTS. THIS COMPANY IS NOT REPUTABLE AND HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!!GET-RICH SCHEMES OF THIS NATURE ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED. THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS TO INCREASE WEALTH DRAMATICALLY-THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. THE TECHNIQUES IN THE BOOK ARE TOTALLY ABSURD. BUY ANY OTHER BOOK ON CREATING WEALTH BEFORE EVEN CONTEMPLATING THIS ONE.
2,Not worth the price.,"While this book does have some good points, the blatant typos and grammatical errors are absolutely distracting. It looks like it hasn't even been to editing in my opinion. The book is small (138 pages in a 5"" x 8"" cover) and it certainly wouldn't be worth the full price.The author does make a few good points but he also jumped right from doing small things to a phrase of ""By being careful I was able to grow to tens of thousands of dollars."" A little simplistic as if it happened overnight.The books seems to be more about attitude than really helping guide someone who is interested in becoming a millionaire. If you can put up with the typos and grammatical errors and you want a book that might pump you up a tiny bit, then go ahead and buy it. If not, buy something more worthwhile."
4,Becoming a Millionaire Within a Year,"John Colt does not waste your time with a lot of words. He gets straight to the point. The 100 page book took me about 1 hour to read. Although the book has a few errors in the writing, I was able to look beyond the imprefections to get the real message. The message is clear and simple - you shape your life by your thoughts. I liked the book because it is short, to the point and the techniques seem easy to follow."
1,"With a title like this, I'm sure it made the author a pretty penny, maybe even a million. Not you or me though!","Sorry, but I've got to agree with other reviewers. This book is pretty much a waste of money, time, and paper. Each chapter was a page or two, followed by a quote (from the book) in bold type, followed by a blank page, followed by the next chapter...You get the idea. Another major gripe: this book was filled with typographical errors. Virtually every page had one, or several typos. I guess the main idea of Mr. Colt was, 'get this thing printed and sold'. There is some good substance. If used, the information in this scanty 'book' would be beneficial. But becoming a millionaire in a year effortlessly? Hardly."
2,Not so impressive,Your average look it's up to you now get motivated stupid. More zen of getting rich than telling you how.
1,Nothing New Here,"Personally, I feel Napolean Hill and Wallace Wattles do a much better job than this guy. I sent my copy back."
1,It is a unnecessary book.,"If you had the intention to buy this book, you are already have the quality to become a millionaire. So don't buy it!"
2,Not worth the money.,"While this book does have some good points, the blatant typos and grammatical errors are absolutely distracting. It looks like it hasn't even been to editing in my opinion. The book is small (138 pages in a 5"" x 8"" cover) and it certainly wouldn't be worth the full price.The author does make a few good points but he also jumped right from doing small things to a phrase of ""By being careful I was able to grow my assets to tens of thousands of dollars."" A little simplistic as if it happened overnight.The books seems to be more about attitude than really helping guide someone who is interested in becoming a millionaire. If you can put up with the typos and grammatical errors and you want a book that might pump you up a tiny bit, then go ahead and buy it. If not, buy something more worthwhile."
1,How bad can a book be?,"How bad can a book be? God only knows, but I would say a quick look at ""Becoming a Millionaire"" by John R. Colt would be a good start. Set aside the awful chapter titles, the poor punctuation, improper use of capitalization and mediocre grammar. Even after you slog through that mess and think that it can get no worse, it does. Believe me, it does. It seems that the author has a vast command of the obvious and inane, though not so much so that he does not have to resort to unusual spacing and a number of blank pages at the end to fill 139 pages in this slim and vacuous volume. If self-help is involved then possibly the only person on the planet that could benefit from reading this book would be the author. If the glossy (but horribly printed) cover burned better I would suggest using it for kindling; since it doesn't, give it to your obnoxious brother in law for Christmas and let him suffer through this sad mess."
1,You'd think millions could pay for an editor...,"Just browse the book online and you'll instantly see what a waste of space it is. It may be inspirational, but come on folks, if you're going to publish a book, at least hire an editor to fix basic grammatical and spelling errors!"
3,Rev. Finis Jennings Dake fills me with inner Joy,I know Bono of U2 read this book before turning to the Dake Study Bible. The success of this band had to be due to a synthesis of the teachings of Rev. Finis Jennings Dake and John R. Colt.John R. Colt didn't create a new religion when he wrote this book because he didn't have to. His religion had already been created: Dake-Bonoism.
5,"I am a millionaire now, after reading this book! Wow!","After reading the book, I understood the process of becoming a millionaire within a year. With the help of this author, I became a millionaire within 2 months after reading the book. It is well worth reading. It will change your life like it did mine."
4,A quality book,"This book may more appropriately have ""international"" in the title, as it is definitely not traditional Chinese wok cooking. Still, it is full of good suggestions, innovative recipes, and helpful photographs."
3,Did not ship in the pictured colors.,"Not a review of the picks themselves (haven't tried them yet) - the colors in the picture are not what was shipped, just brown."
2,Expected More Grip,"I thought the pick would have more of a tacky or grippy feel. Better than a plain Dunlop pick, but nothing special."
3,"OK pick, but too slippery","The picks are fine as picks go. But as soon as they are used for a bit, they get very slippery and move around too much. I would not get these again. I have no similar trouble with Fender Medium Tortoise shells, but they break. Continuing my search...Eddie O"
4,Great...if you like light picks,"These picks are fine as long as you are not looking for a heavy pick. But, as long as you stick to strumming these will suit your needs just fine. I only gave them 4 stars because for .58mm, i think they have a little too much give. The texture is great though, and you can't beat that ""gator grip."""
1,Free Magazine,"This a free magazine. Don't be fooled into paying for it. Go to their website, answer yes to all the questions, and get it free!!"
3,nOT LIKE IT USED TO BE,"I have had Remington electric curlers for many years and many sets. I am sorry that I do not like the clips that go on the rollers and prefer the metal ""picks"" that stick around them. I have saved the picks form the first set I had but that set also had pockets in the front to put the picks. Now the plastic clips go in a separate container and are very hard to attach to the curler so it doesn't slip and holds tight. Please go back to making the set with the pockets in the front of the curler container with space for the horseshoe metal holders. Much better. If you have more of that type of curler with holder, I would like to know the model number and would exchange this one in a minute for one of those. I even have a set for England with the correct attachment so I love these curlers and the size of the container. I just don't like those plastic clips. Judith S. Block"
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this game with the hope that maybe it would be something close to the first, but I was sorely mistaken.I've played a ton of RPG's in the past, and most are always decent. I also played the original Grandia for the PS One (Great Game). The original blew my mind with its well-written plot, and Battle system. But this second installment of Grandia just stunk. It was like someone dug through the garbage and just put together something. The Graphics made me feel like i was play N64 or something. The battle system made the game worth continue play. But it got so easy as the game progresses that you no longer care much the battle system. The game was so short you couldn't appreciate the skills and magic. I mean after playing for a while I found the game all u need to do is set the AI. I hope that the later installments of the game are better made and that more thought goes into to plot like the orginal."
3,a game of mediatory,"This game is one that strived for the middle of the road and got there. There is no really great aspect of the game as well as there is no real hinderance. It tells the story of a mercenary that is cought up with the church, therefore needing to save the world but never quite makes you really get involved in the game. All in all it is simply a good diversion from what you do not want to do in the first place."
3,kneepad or not,"I found these kneepads to be uncomfortable or slipping down. they will last a lifetime, I cant wear them."
2,Buy another brand.,I have had these for a couple of years but I don't use them because they don't stay on and are not comfortable. My old True Value leather ones have performed better. These just look fancy and I thought they would work better at the time.
3,Knee Pads,These are the best pair of knee pads I've used. They are very comfortable but do tend to slip off the knee occasionally. I do metal stud framing and am on the floor most of the day doing layout work.
3,"Great iPod, but be aware that this is not the latest model!","I finally made up my mind to buy an iPod, and it is the best MP3 device that I could ask for -- and I have had several others including the RIO 64MB, and the nomad jukebox 6GB.One thing to be aware of with this model is that this is the older 10GB model and I was both pleased with the iPod and disappointed at the same time. I kept looking through the box for the wired remote and case (being a true geek the temptation to clip anything to my belt is great) but they were nowhere to be found.I had foolishly bought this model thinking that it was the newer, lighter iPod with the wired remote and the case. This is a great MP3 player and probably the best value of all of the iPods, but I would have paid the extra few dollars to get the newer one."
4,"Solid, portable player","Pros* Very small and portable compared to other players of the same size* Clear and easy-to-use buttons and menus* Firewire is nice and fast for large transfers* Charger is integrated into firewire; there is also an AC adapter* Bought this to work with my PC; works great with Adaptec's firewire... Con'sObviously cost* Earbuds are a bit large for me* Not impressed with quality of earphones* No radio tuner; such a simple function would have made the player just that much better* Doesn't support M3U playlists* Might be difficult to implement, but if it could support foreign languages* Wish it had USB2.0 for inter-compatibility with PCs"
1,Overpriced,"I cannot get over how much Apple is asking for this device. I was looking at the Ipod and the RioRiot. And it came down to this: 10 gig player: 500$ 20 gig player: 300$The size factor and apple chic factor is nice, but not worth 200 dollars more for half the storage.As for transfer speed: how often are you going to be transferring a large number of files to it? I loaded mine once and am set.If you are willing to carry a portable that is a little larger you can save alot of money and carry twice as much music with you."
1,Trust me it doesn't even deserve that.,... my friend let me listen to his and it sucked. It was the worst thing I had ever heard. The bass wasn't even adible. Even at full blast I could hardly hear the music. If your going to a mp3 player get the Bantham 350
2,Don't bother getting this set...,"You won't be able to. I've tried three times to order this from Amazon. Each time they let me ride for about two to three weeks before telling me they ""thought they could get it...but they can't."" Do yourself a favor and just pick up the three discs separately. They're just as good. And at least you'll be able to actually get them.Musically this is a 5 star set. However it should be removed from their catalog or at least labeled as unavailable."
4,Thank you for a good item.,Excuse the delay in review.I have received and thank you for a good item.I want intend to buy something from you again.
2,Only relevant to a select few,"This book would be great to those marketing financial services. Example after example is spent determining how to market securities and finding out about how to find them. Unfortunately, if you are in any other line of business, there will be precious little for you to take away with this book. It was a waste of my money, but again, if you are selling financial products go for it.Mark"
3,"Good research, but dated and personal selling oriented","If you're looking to become involved in personal selling to high net worth individuals this book will hit quite close to the mark. However, much of his data is quite dated from the early 80's. A lot of things have changed since then. For instance, he talks about which ethnic groups possess the highest wealth, but his data is very behind.If you're looking for an overall marketing campaign strategy with an affluent target, I believe you'll find this book lacking in substance."
3,Limited target audience,"Much like Stanely's other two works, Selling to the affluent and Networking to the Affluent, it basically a regurgitation of information with a slightly catchy title. The scope of this book, like Stanley's other books has a limited target audience. Do yourself a favor if you feel compelled to purchase a Stanely book, pick one of the 3 and just substitute networking, for Marketing or selling; while saving yourself some time and a few dollars."
5,"Outstanding Book, First of its kind","Dr. Thomas Stanley has become a big name since his book ""The Millionaire Next Door"" but some of his have been tracking his work since his days as Georgia State Professor.This was his breakthrough work. Lots of original research and tremendous insights.I work as a financial consultant to people who receive personal injury awards and found Dr. Stanley's writing extremely valuable.Anyone who works with high producers or who wants to be a high income producer should own this book.Don McNay..."
5,"great tool, wish i bought it along time ago","wonderful design, works great. i love the spoke wrench adapter and the t-handle function. highly reccomend this product. also the website for the tool company is very helpful and professional."
4,Perceptively funny,I howled at the observations in this book. Everyone was at the mercy of the pen and the light humor was in very good taste. Some references I didn't understand (guess that's why I needed the book....). I recommend it to anyone who is curious about what goes on beyond the scenes in Hollywood.
1,Poor attempt at mythology,"The author uses very simplistic vocabulary and repetitive style. Due to stylistic sloppiness, the read is unintentionally ridiculous on almost every page, greatly damaging the suspension of disbelief for this true story. By avoiding character complexity, Carlson attempts to create mythological prototypes, but falls short of bringing the book to the level of an epic. I would have enjoyed this much more at the age of ten, if it weren't for occasional strong language and adult content."
1,A real disappointment,"My sister purchased this for me as I am an avid hiker and mountain climber. This story, in addition to being almost entirely incoherent, and lacking in style, was completely misrepresented in the publishers description. All of this business about self-examination I found to be immature and whiny .. .Save your money"
4,That which does not destroy me...,"...I congratulate Brett for having the patience and the courage to bring his story to the masses- and a fine story it is.... I will say that I think that he could have made a longer novel with the amount of working content he had. I wasn't turned off by his naming scheme, and Brett clearly eases the reader into the idea so that we get comfortable with the switch early on.All in all, it works as a quick and interesting read for all. Good times."
5,"I hope I like it, I wrote it....",It was a fun book to write. I feel I accomplished my goal- a quick page-turner with a strong underlying meaning. Thanks to all my readers. I have been blessed with a strong readership. Brett; brett@cowboynow.net
3,Changing careers,"My wife is changing careers and I thought this would be an excellent book. It is, but all pictures are in black & white. She could have used some color photos."
3,Its Ok,"This is my second bottle im using and although it does seem to make the hairs somewhat thicker, its nowhere near whats claimed on the bottle. Bottle claims that ""you will see significant thickening after one use"" but that is too good to be true so use the whole bottle and maybe you'll see some change. My bro was using it as well and he did start to see some fine hair regrow so thats why i bought another bottle. Smells great though so thats a plus :) I use the shampoo and their conditioner every day."
5,Very Enjoyable,"I first became introduced to Ardal O'Hanlon through the Father Ted BBC series. I found him to be very witty and his delivery was right on the mark every time! When I found out he had written a book I was dying to read it. I wasn't disappointed. I found myself not being able to put the book down. I won't go into details about the story (you can read the other reviews for that). I will simply state that I enjoyed the book and it carried me away for a few hours while reading it. It is funny, sad, depressing, enlightening, thorough and complete. You don't often find so many levels in one story. Definitely recommended. By the way, if you haven't seen the Father Ted series check out the DVD! You will laugh non-stop!"
5,Forget 'Angela's Ashes' here is a real picture of Ireland.,"Having grown up and attended college in Ireland in the eighties this book brought back a flight of memories. The author's recounting of an insecure, jealous Irish male is note perfect. The book is funny, disturbing and accurate down to the smallest details. How did the Author know they played 'New York New York' to close my local disco every Saturday night?"
1,"Sorry, I didn't like it.","I'm usually extremely tolerant of the books I read, and always try to give authors the benefit of the doubt in my reviews. Unfortunately, I just didn't like this book. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly why, but I just didn't find it either amusing or entertaining. It was an almost non-stop rant, both bleak and depressing. Occasionally the Irish slang was offputting, but I overcame that as I went along. There were many times that I just wanted to throw it against the wall and not finish it, but I felt a duty to see it through if I wanted to write a review. The one good thing about this book is that it was fairly short, so I didn't waste a lot of time on it."
2,Waste of Money,"When i purchased this controller, i was expecting it to have a nice grip and a comfortable hand position. I was dead wrong. The ""grips"" aren't even considered that. It is hard plastic and the C-Stick is very flimsy. The ""A"" button makes a loud obnoxious sound when pressed and the controller just feels WAY too big. This is a downright waste of money. I am most likely going to sell it at a garage sale and buy the new wireless controller."
1,Do not buy this,"I have a maximum of 1,000 words to write, but I only need 4; DONT BUY THIS CONTROLLER! I had this thing for not even two weeks, and it started to act up, now it is toatlly broken, and I bet I'm not the only one this has happened to. I would by anX-Box before I buy anything from Mad-Catz again!!"
2,Cubicon Stinks!,"I bought a Gamecube a few weeks ago. It came with a free game and a starter pack. Of course the Cubicon controller was in the starter pack. At first, the Cubicon was all I used, but then I actually tried the Nintendo brand controller that came in the Gamecube box. I am glad I tried it! Because when I tried the Nintendo brand one, I was amazed! It felt so much better than the Cubicon! One reason why I hate the Cubicon is because the B button is down too low and when you reach for it the C stick gets in the way! The reason I gave it 2 stars was because it has a rubber grip on it (I like grips). But now I don't even touch the thing! It is a waste of money!!!!! DONT BUY IT!"
1,Good if you have a lot of cash $$$,"When I first got this controller I thought is was good, cheap, and better for my big hands. I also thought that the grips were good too. I was mistaken! The controller worked fine for about 10 months until some buttons kept getting stuck in the controller and then the c-stick failed to work completly. I looked at the reveiws of this before, I found out I was lucky that Mine lasted that long. If you have this controller and it hasn't broken yet, trust me it will break! I will never trust another Madcatz product again!"
1,I'm not really sure HOW they stay alive...,"...as Madcatz peripherals do seem to break in less then 1/2 a week. I wouldn't suggest anything from them. Know, for the size, I put the original controller next to the Madcatz one and, well, no real difference. the handles SEEMES to be thicker, but not by much. The grip and frilles might seem conventional, but, it doesn't look induring."
4,Not A Very Good Controller,"When I first bought the controller, I thought it looked cool and would be great because of the grips. But after about 5 months, the A and B buttons are both stuck in the controller. THIS CONTROLLER WILL NOT LAST."
3,It's breaking,"I got 2 about a month ago, and now I kinda regret that. It was OK, but pretty big. Now, my buttons are sticking together! Stick with the original."
2,Durability is questionable,"After only two days of use, the buttons began to stick. Several months later the controller is almost completely unusable. I would recommend getting something more durable."
3,"flawed, but not a bad deal","I found this controller to be better than the original GC controller for games like SSX Tricky and Tony Hawk, thanks to its larger overall dimensions and the larger D-pad. However, it's terrible for games that require very precise analog stick control, because the stick tends to resist light steering pressure. For a game like XG3, it's basically useless. In other respects it's a respectable alternative controller; the build quality is decent, it's comfortable and it's cheap."
3,So So,This controller is ok but it screws up every once in a while. If you have small hands don't get this. But if you have big bulky hands this is an exellent buy. The problem is after a month the joystick would move but the player wouldn't. So i restarted the gamecube with a different controller. Then it worked fine. So for a month you should use it after that...
2,only works half the time,When i bought the controller it worked fine for about 2 weeks then it started to act wierd most noticably in madden 2002 the anlong stick would act funny and the guys would run really really slow even created players that were maxed out i pluged in the nintendo one that came with the system and they ran fine so dont buy this controller if at all possible
1,Do not get this game pad.,"This game pad, is very light and it feels like it came from the dollar store. And when I put it in my cube it turns off by it's self, and don't take chances with it cause it might mess up your game cube."
2,Didn't work for more than a few months,"I love the feel of this mouse - b/c it's small. BUT ... it's very inconsistent. I've had to reset it several times and it often just stops. I'm taking my chances and ordering a Logitech - hopefully, that will work a little better.I would not recommend this item."
5,Have owned for 4 years - still great!,"I'm not sure why others are having problems. I have used this mouse on both xp and vista 64 bit with success. I have owned this mouse about 4 years and find the battery life to be great. I do have to angle my pc tower so that the receiver is pointed in the direction of the mouse but have a good signal of about 4 ft away. If I get much further away or turn my tower in a different direction, I receive the battery low alert which is not the case. The size and shape of this mouse works really well for small to medium feminine hands. The mouse also glides well over most surfaces and is very responsive. I don't use the special features and set the middle button to scroll pages. I use my pc and this mouse about 10 hours a day for those 4 years. I would cry if something happened to this mouse so I'm here looking to buy another."
1,worst mouse ever,"I've had several wireless mice in the past, and this one by far is worst of the lot. My greatest issue is with the left mouse working intermittently. It literally took me several clicks on the same button or link to do anything. Basically you have no idea if your left click is going to work or does nothing, so you end up clicking several times to see something happen. Would not recommend this to anyone despite the low price."
4,"It Keeps Going, and Going, and Going","Decades after it's initial release, THE COMPLETE BOOK OF RUNNING has become a classic and remains what it was Fixx intended it to be: a great guide for beginners and a textural gathering place for multitudes of runners.Some of the training tips have been overwhelmed by further study, and Fixx's recommendation to buy good running shoes has been slammed as the starting point for Nike's attempt to take over the universe, but the book is still inspirational to anyone looking for some kind of cultural backbone for what is, at it's core, the most individualist fitness activity."
3,not very breathable,"These socks do not fall down which is what I was looking for, but they do not breathe well."
1,it is not what they sent!,"They didn't send what was pictured! I needed the elbow attached to the pcv valve more than anything...all o reciever was the pcv valve, no elbow. NOT WHAT WAS PICTURED"
4,great product,The lines on these post-it notes help my 3rd grader to write his letters better on those special assignments that require a post-it. I wish they weren't the pop-up style.
5,Best Bang for Buck,"Put simply, this is the best ""Deal"" I have been able to find on the 3 x 3 Post-it Pop-Up Notes. If you are reading this, chances are you are looking for a ""Deal"", too (being that this is for a 6 pack of pads). If you don't already know the quality and/or convenience of 3M's Post-it Note, then you may want to read another review of the Single Pack but I highly recommend them (both the Pop-Up and Standard Post-it) to anyone who needs 'on the go' reminders, etc."
4,About what I expected,"This radio is about what I expected and wanted. It is by no means a fancy unit. The case seems relatively cheap and fragile. However, it does what I want and I am satisfied. The white LED is not, of course, as bright as a 'real' flashlight, but it works for me. The tuning is analog and so-so, but again works OK. I don't understand the power selection switch: Batt, Dyn, Solar. Seems like the radio should be smart enough to handle the power source automatically. Maybe a switch to disable the batts from being used unless you really want to would be logical. Overall, I like it."
2,Disappointment...,"I researched solar powered AM/FM/SW radios until I was blue in the face and eventually decided on this one.Unfortunately,it wouldn't charge correctly by A/C power right out of the box.When I eventually did get the radio charged,I was greeted with horrible FM and SW reception.AM reception was actually quite good and I believe the LED flashlight could run for days if needed.I returned the KA011 and purchased an Eton FR-160 which is AM/FM/Weather and highly rated here at Amazon and elsewhere.My search for a usable,affordable solar powered shortwave radio goes on. :-("
2,disappointed,The queality of the speakers and reception is decent but the back light on the digital display does not work.
5,This works for Weight Watchers dieters!,"When I ordered this I had no idea how many of the meals I would like. I have made several now and they are flavorful and low in calories and fat. I have been a WW for 1 year and I even can make recipes that are on the Core plan. I love all of the choices and I hope that dieters will try this book, they won't be disappointed."
3,pretty but not too helpful,The best part of the book for me are the little snippets about her family and how things came about and why some things are the way they are for her. It is a pretty book and has nutritional breakdown for each recipe-I won't buy one without that anymore.
2,Outdated,Bought the map because I am buying a house in the 77355 area. The map is a 2004 copyright. The urbanization existed in 2004 but the map shows a big gap west of Pinehurst. The area has developed quite fast but the map is outdated.
4,Great with red wine,"I really enjoyed this book. Generally, the stories are great. The first few tales are very, very good. Towards the end of the book, Sade loses steam, but that doesn't mean that the stories are any less imaginative. I guess I thought it was hard to follow up ""Florville and Courval"".I would definitely recommend reading the ""essay on novels"" thoroughly before reading the stories. Also, read the explanatory notes! Sometimes, it is trivial biographical/historical information, but occasionally there is some very insightful analysis of the text that help explain the point Sade is trying to make. A few of the devices that Sade employs will seem like cliches, but it should be kept in mind that much of his writing is reactionary.Finally, his stories should also be read in the context of France immediately after the revolution. As the biography points out, Sade escaped the guillotine on a technicality. Hence his disillusionment with liberal republican ideals."
2,Could be better if more authentic,I was expecting a little more from the reviews I have heard about this book.A lot of quotes from other authors and very little original material.Anyone can make a copy and paste book of quotes. It felt like I was reading a pre-bought High School thesis. I read it then re-listed it the same day.
5,Makes my car feel like new again,"Made my 13 year old honda feel like new again, these are the orig plugs honda uses in the civic and they work great"
2,Decent Deal,"The movies look ok on my Hdtv but not like other blu ray with real good quality,I would recommend for folks who want a cheap blu ray movie with okish quality."
5,I love it and if you have anymore good double features like this let me know,"I love it and looking forward to purchase some more, it was 100% accurate. I would totally recommend you other buyers - Thank You"
3,Thirteen ghosts/ House of Wax,not very good movie .But I enjoy watching this movie. Not very scare at all. This movie us a B movie. I though they should put more scare set to the movie and make people jump up from their chair.
4,Incredible!,"This book is AMAZING!! I didn't read any of the previous books that you wrote, but after this book I read every single one... well maybe not all of them."
4,Spectacular read,"Amazing book, it was so suspenseful. You are pulled into the story and doesn't let you out. Unfortunatly, I did not read the first book and had to catch up on the story. If you plan on reading this, which you should, read Blue is for Nightmares first."
4,White is for Magic,I am pleased with the time that it took to get this book. My daughter enjoys reading and re-reading the series. This book was a good choice for a young teen as a gift.
5,"""White Is For Magic""",This book got me hooked! I LOVE IT! i cant wait till the next one. i recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery and people who like magic. So far i've read the first to books and im dying to read the next one! :-)
5,as expected,First time I bought something from amazon and I am extremely happy with the book I got. It looks practically new.
3,A bit of repetition that bodered me a little,"I thought the first book was really good, this one is not as good good (just good). It may be that while I read it I felt I had already read this story in the first book. Did they had to kidnapped again the exact same friend that was kidnapped in book 1? That just bodered me. The story felt to easy too come up with. But don't get me wrong; it was a really fun read and I read at any chance I had. Just to give you a hint:*Stacey and her mom have a heart to heart*Love triangle again, well this time it looks more like a square*There's a new guy in school. His name's Jacob and he's magical..."
5,Beautiful treasure of forgotten cinema,"Beautiful treasure of forgotten cinema.Edward Mann is a talent unknown to American cinema history, but yet a great one.A must watch for Film Noir fans."
1,Beenie Man advocates the killing of gays,"In his music, Beenie Man advocates killing gays. More than30 gays have been killed in Jamaica, where he comes from.His music has lots of influence there. In some cases mobssang his anti-gay songs while they killed a man who might have been gay.In most countries ""incitement to violence"" is a crime,but the line between that and protected free speech is fuzzy.When asked to apologize and change his ways, Beenie Man wrote a songabout how he would not apologize. If someone advocated the killingof Chinese or Jews, they would not be tolerated. It seems strangethat in the 21st century the world still tolerates someonewho advocates the killing of gays. I suspect that the worldwould not tolerate this if white men were getting killed.Please don't support him by purchasing his music."
1,Poor product,"Overall, this seems to be a poor product. The rear tail light never worked - it came broken. The light itself seems to be in good shape, so I don't think it was the shipping that broke it. I suspect it's just poorly made."
1,not worth it....,"The lights are pretty strong, while they have enough juice. I find myself changing the batteries every couple weeks when I only use the lights rarely."
4,Take it antiquing with you!,This is a great little book to take antiquing with you if you collect English silver. Although not exactly pocket size it can still fit in your bag or you can hold on to it without it getting cumbersome. Unlike many of the other silver ID books the hallmarks shown in this book are large and clear enough that you don't need your glasses to decipher them. A nice plus is that it reviews selected makers of Georgian through 20th Century silver and offers a little comment on their work.
2,Definately NOT for the Beginner,"Unless you are extremely experienced with Silver and Gold items and what / where their origin may be, this book is probably not for you. The chances of being able to find what you are looking for reminds me of looking for a needle in a haystack. The marks are illustrated in VERY SMALL 1/4"" black and white diagrams, column after column, put in tables with time period or comment in print that is even smaller than the diagram. Several (bordering on too many) of the marks look very much the same and after looking at 170 pgs of extremely small and not necessarily clear diagrams and images, I feel I should of spent my money elsewhere for info on silver ID."
2,Not for the Beginner,"Not easy for any beginner to use. Unless you knew exactly what kind of silver you were trying to identify i.e. English, Scottish, Irish... etc, it was a bit confusing. Marks are black & white, some not showing very good clarity and everything is in extremely in small print. If you just want to sort through tons of marks and dates, this may be for you. If you want information about your piece, pass it up."
1,Waste!,I ordered two units and neither would hold a charge. Charged both unitsfor 24 hours as instructed but to no avail.
1,Not Worth it,"12 hours may seem like a long time but keep in mind according to Nintendo you can get up to 100 hours on a single pair of regular AAs. And no you won't be able to recharge this thing an unlimited number of times, I've purchased a number of battery packs for the gameboy and gameboy advance systems, after 20-25 charges you'll be lucky if you can get an hour out of them and will need a new pack. You also have to charge this thing for about 12 hours each time it's been drained (24 before the first use)."
1,2 Later and no working pack,I bought one of these packs and it diddent work after over 24hrs of charge so i brought it back and got another same problem. I would never recomend even trying this item
1,Dont waste your money,"Please, don't waste your money! This is the second one I have bought and they just don't work.My first one got fried when I tried to charge it. After opening it up I saw that several components got melted. I thought that it was a defective one so I ordered another. The same thing happened. Just stick with regular recharchable batteries and save money and frustration."
5,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful instrument. It came very nicely protected / wrapped. It is somewhat hard to string the first few times, but that's as expected. It has a very nice, strong sound."
2,Don't buy,"Don't waste your money on this. The wood is close to impossible to bend and once you do, the sound quality is horrible. Better off getting from a site that actually makes beriumbaus."
4,Much better than I expected,Great story line. The unexpected twists and character development truly made this book better than I expected. I definitely look forward to reading the rest of the series.
2,Distant Dreams,Bought the series for a gift-they were described as new-this one had a big black mark across the bottom-a magic marker line-can't give this as a gift. You didn't say that these were seconds.
5,Distant Dreams,"Good Authors. You can relate to stories. They keep your interest and most of all, they are christian authors. Would recommendthese books to everyone."
3,I don't find myself picking up this book to finish it.,"Historical research was evident in this book, but I lost track of the story. I may try finishing it later."
1,Incredibly Lame Video,"This is literally the lamest video I have ever seen in class. It deserves to become an internet meme. The animation is horrible, and the sound effects are cheesy and weird. They used like 3 different voice actors for all the organelles. I was laughing out loud the entire video."
1,Smell,Smells nothing like the Calming Night soap nor lotion. I would have thought it was a totally different product. It smelled like a generic wash.
2,"While once a great resource, information is now dated.","This book was great during the 1997 time period when it was first published. However, INS has made so many recent changes and interim rulings that in terms of a ""how to"" book I find it to be dated and no longer totally reliable for current law."
5,A great book for simple immigration cases,"There are many persons who believe immigration attorneys are necessary in every case - untrue. For the most part, a healthy dose of self-help is prudent and cost-effective.This book describes common scenarios and basic legal cases in what can only be described as ""story book"" form - clear, concise and direct. I have read all the self help manuals and this one deserves your review.If you have a simple immigration case..get this book, read it and follow the directions carefully. You will save thousands in attorney fees."
5,Simply Beautiful,"The photos in this book are quite stunning. Somehow Curt Richter has produced scores of telling and rather magnetic portraits of sagging, middle-aged Southern writers. A miracle of sorts. Highly recommended."
2,This book is a little too gross for comfort!,"The children's book, The Teacher from the Black Lagoon, written by Mike Thaler is about a young boy's fears on his first day of school. The boy's teacher, Mrs. Green, was infamous for being an unpleasant teacher, and he dreams that she eats and dismembers parts of her students' bodies. The boy was more than happy to wake up and realize that his teacher was just a nice, normal, friendly young lady."
1,Inappropriate for 5 year olds!,"As a parent of a 5 year old I was shocked when the teacher sent this home for reading homework. A child this age doesn't need to see images of a child without a head, or half a body, or being consumed by fire. My child has a great respect for teachers. Just because a teacher doesn't look like the supposed all-American female doesn't mean she's going to be a monster. Do we want to teach our children fear of teachers? The age rating on this book is too young. We're the kind of parents who screen T.V., movies and even commercials. Violence in the media is rampant. Foster goodness before evil."
1,Not for every child,The Black Lagoon books can be hit or miss. They are great chapter books for boys in some respect...but my very sensitive son found this one too disturbing. Unfortunately the teacher read it to the whole class- I would not have chosen this book for my child.Please don't call my child a wimp or accuse me of coddlng him. Every child is different.
5,sharing giggles,Book read by 6 year old aloud to Grandma and his twin - everyone found it funny - boys were not remotely tempted to believe any of the monster elements - only adverse comment was how often the teacher's name/colour was Green - we had a compilation book containing 4 stories. We will be actively looking for the rest in the series. It gave an opportunity to explain how rumours start and how older kids might exaggerate facts and for them not to be afraid or apprehensive about their schools.
1,Not appropriate content for young children,"My son who is in kindergarten, was upset and freaked out about this book. Apparently his class watched it as a video in class and he was so disturbed by the story that he could barely fall asleep tonight. Apparently some kids and parents think this book is funny- but it had the opposite affect in our house. When he was telling me about the story, I had a hard time believing he really watched what he was describing. I did a general google search on ""teacher blowing fire at kids"" and this book popped up right away. I knew immediately he was describing this book- no one could make this up. Obviously the author had intentions in his writing other than to freak kids out, but for some, that is the result."
4,"""Mystikal"" Wallace Roney","Loved the whole album. But ""Just my imagination is stupendous!!!! It is obvious that he loves Miles Davis but still has his own modern style."
2,you get what you paid for,very cheap. doesn't stick too well. falls off fast.leaves residue on the keyboard.
5,Smells So Good,"and it makes mt boys hair so soft, it wont hurt his eyes and even makes the bath smell good"
5,Taking care of your expensive tools,It's a great way to protect what is one of the most expensive tools carried daily in my tool bags.
2,chopped...not really :-(,"I essentially got this chopper for my love of onions, but my hate for chopping.I was disappointed when my medium sized vidalia got stuck several times to the blade like the onion was too big for it :-( I would scoop it out, but it would be stuck again. It finally did its job when I started to quarter the onions.I tried it on garlic and ginger and some dryfruits and it did a good job.Cleaning was easy."
2,chopper??,I tried to chop an onion first. I cut the onion into quarters and chopped one quarter at a time.The chopper jammed and I had to clear it several times for the rest of the onion. Worked fine on mushrooms. Just be cautious with your expectations. The spring inside seems like it's not strong enough to work properly.
1,Disappointment,"The chopper's hopper is very small. I can only chop small, pre-diced items. It got stuck in the food and I had to pull the lever out with much difficulty."
4,sturdier than others,"I have had several of these, and yes, I am very rough with them. This one is sturdier than the others I have had and I'm quite happy with the performance, though I would like it to be larger. My Pampered Chef chopper was nice and easy to clean but when it broke, they wanted when I bought it, who hosted the party... I gave up on their ""lifetime warranty"" and bought this one."
4,Great garlic chopper,"This is the chopper you want for garlic, it chops much finer that a full size chopper. I use it with the pealed garlic that Costco sells in 3lb containers. You can chop a handful of garlic in seconds.The one downside is that it's not terribly durable. My first chopper lasted for a couple of years before it broke which isn't bad for a $10 item but it could better built."
4,works as intended,"only negative is that included spoon will not stay clipped onto the side.this item works better if instead of slapping it, you place your hand on top of it and then push down. easier to clean than cheaper versions"
2,Not for onions-only garlic,Great design if you want a chopper for garlic or tiny things but the thing cannot handle a regular size onion. I bought with the idea of chopping single onions but it can only do an onion if I half and then quarter it. When they said mini they meant nothing above a garlic clove or two. I am unhappy with the thing because of what I wanted to do with it.- but the disign is lovely and I guess in the full size I would have what I want.
2,Good if you never want to wash it.,"I had an old chopper that had the housing that butterfly'd open to clean. The blades were getting dull after about 10 years of use. Don't even remember the brand.Purchased the OXO. This thing chops real good. But............ Hope you never want to disassemble it, wash it, and re-assemble it. What a pain! The person that designed this monster obviously does not wash it (or likes to spend lots of time disassembling/re-assembling things).I'm giving mine to someone I don't like and buying the Pampered Chef chopper that butterfly's open."
3,Disappointed by the Oxo Chopper,"I have owned three of these choppers. The first one I bought at Kohls sometime before February 2008. It fell apart at that time, so I took advantage of Oxo's legendary warranty and sent it back to the company. They replaced it, and then it fell apart in June 2010. I sent it back, and Oxo promptly replaced it. Today chopper number three bit the dust, and I'm sending it back shortly.When these choppers work, they're great. I primarily used mine for garlic, carrots, and celery, and I've used it numerous times for various nuts. It stays sharp, washes comparatively easily, and is very quick.I've tried to cut up raisins with the chopper, and have not had any success with that."
1,Worthless,This chopper can't even get through an onion or a bell pepper. I spent more time trying to get the chopper to work than I would have just chopping the veggies by hand. Definitely would not recommend this product.
3,*Perfect* homemade ham salad,"Bought it for my wife and she agrees it is worthless on scallions. I can imagine that any skin/outer layers left on white/yellow onions will also cause problems. However, we found a use for it with our leftover Christmas ham that makes it a keeper. It makes perfect small diced ham salad that was much improved over food processor prepared. The chop size and resulting texture were outstanding."
2,Oxo good grips chopper,"Cup way too small and holds too little. difficult to use if you put too much in, which isnt much. I was dissappointed."
3,I like my chopper but it's use is limited.,"I like the chopper but it's pretty limited.Pros: Easy to take apart and clean. (Just watch your fingers when taking out blades) Doesn't require that much space in the cabinet. Chops garlic fairly well.Cons: Doesn't chop onions well. Won't hold that much product when chopping. The the top will sometimes lock while chopping.In my opinion, it was worth the $10 I spent on it and it's easier to clean than my food processor. I'm not sure I would ever upgrade to the larger chopper though."
2,time = noodles,overdosing on time and money simultaneously omar rodriguez-lopez and damo suzuki is of interest to only completist collecters
2,still waiting to be heated,Eclectic and strange music that wore out its welcome after the first listen.
3,Good thing it's just an EP,"I just listened to this, it's alright. I kind of think that Omar is capable of much more than this. The first half (track 1) is great but what is even the point of track 2--it's the exact same feckin' thing!I actually have an early (2005) live recording of this ""song,"" played by Omar's quintet with Suzuki sitting in. Haven't listened to it in awhile, maybe I'll do a little comparison later. Anyway, glad I downloaded this before buying it. It's good, but not really mind-blowing, at least compared to what I think is Omar's best work to date."
4,House water pressure checker,"This device, for $11, allowed me to check my house's City of Detroit water pressure. I was hearing a little water hammer noise, & was told my pressure should be set to about 60psi. With this gauge I found out it was at 82psi, so I throttled it down. A handy gadget; a good investment."
2,Not sure on this one,"A plumber told me to initially turn the faucet on a little to ""fill up the guage"" first, then turn the faucet to full throttle or it would not give a good reading.I have a faucet that water literally gushes out of and one that water comes out very modestly. Yet I got readings of 60mpsi on both. Now I don't have faith in the readings."
2,Not For Outdoor Use,I purchased this gauge to monitor water pressure at the outside connection for my RV. Be warned it's not water proof and I now have some water inside the gauge which is from rain. The gauge still works but I suspect that the water inside will cause failure in the near future. I suspect that if this gauge was used in a weather protected location it would work just fine. I suspect that within a year I will be looking for a replacement and will take care to find something that is in fact water proof.
2,"Adorable, but just too small for anything!","I bought this for our toddler because all he needs is maybe two diapers and some wipes, but we can't even fit that in here! This is really too small for any practical use."
2,Amazon didn't indicate belt choices picked wrong belt,"I didn't know there was 2 sizes for Trailblazer 4.2 engine serpentine belt. Amazon didn't indicate a choice. I had to send belt back and pay return shipping. Bought different brand, that one worked. I will have to double check next time. I had to search other sites to find right belt."
3,"pretty good book, but by no means definitive","The author obviously likes Honda motorcycles, and it does give a fairly accurate account of the models available by years. I don't like his choices on a fair amount of the example models he chose to give pictures of; I was expecting more of a comprehensive coverage of models, pictures of each model, and specs like the book Standard Catalog of American Cars (also by Krause Publications but sadly out of print). Overall a good read but could have been a lot better."
4,No SL series? No Trail 70 bikes? I miss 1970.,Why no mention or pics of the SL series or the cool small trail bikes from 1970? Was hoping to relive a bit of my childhood here.
2,Wish I could use this publication...,"Photos in this publication were faded and lacking in true colors--a real handicap for wildflower identification. Additionally, the binding was feeble. I won't be using this book.The service was prompt."
1,Fairly useless,"This replaced a cheese slicer I'd used for years and years (the wire finally broke and was not replaceable). On this slicer, the wire loosens way too easily. It needs constant tightening, which requires pliers & a screwdriver. I did find a suitable, functional way to slice cheese! A knife."
2,Can't cut the cheese,"This product looked nice when I got it, but one I used it a few times the wire got really loose and there is no easy way to tighten it. Wouldn't recommend."
2,Poor Quality Item,This is not a quality item. I purchased it as 'small extra gift' to go along with some other things I purchased for a friend's birthday. It's going in the trash. All the other negative reviews are spot on.
2,More of a Cheesy Slicer than a Cheese Slicer,"In our case, one of the guides seemed to be bent and the adjustable roller would not slide up and down the guides. Due to the fact that this thing is made out of some kind of cheap, molded plastic (looks metal); we couldn't bend the guides out either. Heating it in hot water and loosening the wire did allow enough flexibility for me to force the roller up enough to slice thinner than 1/2""."
1,Terrible Slicer,"When I received this slicer, the metal cutting band was bent, and we couldn't tighten it at all! It was an awful purchase even for the cheap price."
4,At last -- a cheese slicer!,"We've been married 28 years, my husband and me. All those years, I've been slicing cheese with a paring knife. I've grumbled about the different thicknesses of the slices, the annoyance when I cut myself instead of the cheese, etc. Finally, I'd had it. I found the perfect slicer, with the ability to adjust the thickness of what I'm slicing (because it's good for other things, too, such as butter). Life is so good -- and I grumble no more."
1,cheese slicer,"I didn't want to reveiw this product because I was unhappy with it, because you keep asking me for a reveiew I'll give you one. The cheese slicer wire broke the very first time I used it, because it didn't cost a lot I never said any thing-but-I would never buy another."
2,"If you want uneven, wibbidy slices, this one's for you.","Crummy product. Or maybe just a defective one. Ours arrived (and has stayed) with a bent, loose wire. Packaging says ""just tighten screws to put tension in the wire"" or something like. HA! The screws cannot be turned. Waste. Of. Money."
2,Disappointing,The cutting wire is too loose and is not easily tightened. I would look for a better slicer. There are pleny on the market.
5,Beginning hunter info,"For the beginner elk hunter, this book is a real must. The photography alone is worth the price. For a Midwest deer hunter like myself, the info in this book was so valuable on my first few trips out west."
2,ok book,I grew up hunting whittail deer and reading about hunting whitetail. So when I bought this book I thought it would give you a lot of information like that. I can sum it up in a few words. When it is warm hunt high when it is cold hunt low. Try hunting around water. That is about it.
4,Elk Tactics,Very well wriiten book on elk hunting. Not fluffy and very informative. Could have been longer and a bit more detailed in some aspects however.
5,wow,"for a long time, Seabiscuit was my favorite sports book...and that book is amazing. but now, this book is at the top of my list, its downright incredible. i am a swimming fan, so that could be why i liked it so much, but natalie coughlin is such an amazing person, and if this book and her accomplishments don't convince you of that...i dont know what will."
4,For swimmers of ALL ages!,What a great book! A great read for 12+ swimmers and a MUST READ for all swim parents! This book really helped me gain perspective on my children's swimming and my own!
1,Fools Gold,"Michael Silvers book is an unfair account of the sport of swimming and it's training methods which have been used for years by coaches at all levels in this country and abroad. I didn't see anything in his book where he credits any individual or organization for information which leads me to believe that his work is unsubstantiated. He also sensationalized a story that is not one that only Natalie Coughlin could tell. Many high level athletes have injuries they ""come back"" from. Very onesided.....and as a swimmer regard this book as not one I would ever recommend."
1,The Negative Book about Swimming,"I have read the book and I am shocked of the wayshe talks about her coaches and some of her teammates. Negative, selfish!It is sad how a champion of her caliber can write a book like this one.I do not recommend this book to children or any person who might wantto get a view of swimming.Do not waste your money on this book. Find other books who willgive you a positive inside of the sport of swimming like the MichaelPhelps' book or Summer Sanders' book.I would like to give O starts to this book."
1,Choose another book if you want to read about Natalie.,"I purchased this book to find out about Natalie's swimming career and how she was able to achieve success in swimming and her Olympic accomplishments. Instead I found the writer, Michael Silver, writing more about the coach, McKeever and the other swimmers under McKeever's tutelage. There is not much about Natalie in this book but rather more is written about the others around her. I am extremly disappointed in this book and would not recommend it if you want to read about Natlalie's life and swimming career."
3,Pretty Good Book,"Being the father of two USA swimming daughters, I found this to be just an ""okay"" read. While I did find it rather annoying for the author to repeatedly bash the Terrapins, Silver did a good job portraying the pressure coaches are under to get a name for themselves by unnecessarily pushing their swimmers too far. Nonetheless, I enjoyed how the book described McKeever's unorthodox techniques and chronicled the behind the scenes march to the Olympics. In the end, it did leave me with a bit of a tarnished view of Natalie, which is a bit disappointing given the title of the book. I strongly recommend Gold in the Water."
2,Breaks after a couple months,"At first everything was fine but after about 3 months the LCD Backlights started flashing like crazy at random times. Now the lights don't work at all and I can't see the display. The controller still works though, I remember what buttons to press to use it, but what shoddy quality this is.If the LCD display was fine I would recommend it. If they fixed this issue I would buy another one."
1,DOA,I bought this cool little cooler at a local retailer and installed it the installation went fine it was when I turned on the power when |I realized that fan 4 had no power at all I took the computer apart again to check it out I moved 4 to 1 and 1 to 4 still no power |I kept the fan commander about 6 months before it CRATERED No display at all just backlighting the fans are running at full so the computer will be fine until I get a new controller
5,Watch an expert play two sessions,"There are 52 hands. Mike Lawrence walks you through all his thoughts as he plays those hands. This is a once in a lifetime chance to sit behind a great player and have him tell you why he is doing what he is doing. Not a book for beginners, but if you are developing a good feel for the game of bridge, this book will be invaluable, not to mention interesting."
2,apply on the OUTSIDE of the window,"I just received them and have not applied them yet. I was so excited because I figured I could finally stop the birds from hitting my windows. You have to apply these to the OUTSIDE of your windows. I have very high windows and am terrified of heights. Now I have to find someone to get up the 2 stories to my family room to apply these things. If you apply in colder months, you have to wash the window with warm water prior to applying these things. This is NOT exactly convenient at all. I am quite disappointed. They use the fact that you can reposition them as a selling point, but how often do they think we'll be climbing up on the ladder to do that? If they were inside, that would be wonderful. I have no idea if they work or not since they haven't been applied yet. If I get them applied and they work I will update the comment, until then, I am not happy at all."
5,The Great Game,"Mr. Hopkirk in all of his works is accurate, profound and should be mandatory reading for all Foreign Service personnel. Having done Central Asia, the book was the ""bible"" in knowing the intimate details needed to not only do business in the post-Soviet era, but just in being able to discuss and move within the people where many thousands could not even bring voice to such concepts in the old days, which today are only ""chatted"" about in remote areas. Hopkirk rips at the fabric of humanity in what the west thinks is proper and what is reality in an eastern environment with its many passionate, intelligent, warm, and emotionally infectious people. I have read all of Peter's works several times and I continue to do so. You just have to be there to know that Hopkirk hits the nerve. It's just too much!!G. Jannotta"
4,Who needs Indiana Jones?,"What can I write that hasn't already been written about this book? It's an incredibly fun read, Hopkirk makes you feel the urgency of the adventures the archaelogists are having. Sven Hedin's adventures are the ones that have left an indelible mark on me. I'll be picking up his book for Christmas! Although I agree the ""let's plunder to preserve"" mentality comes off disingenous, I don't think the people who took out these artifacts from the Taklamakon expected them to be stored away in the back of museums, remembered only by authors who worked in Central Asia!Thanks to Peter Hopkirk I have a new region and era to wargame! Thanks PH!"
5,Excellent,"An excellent survey of the explorers of the Silk Road. In response to the New England reviewer, the bulk of the material in fact DID survive WWII; the majority of the texts were brought by Paul Pelliot to the National Library in Paris. There is also a collection in London. Therefore, Hopkirk's argument does stand (see the trouble Victor H. Mair had in finding funding for the Tarim Mummies!)."
2,Patronizing,"An interesting account, but Hopkirk's endorsement of the plundering of national treasures as ""preservation"" is a little disingenuous, given that the contents of the Thousand Buddha Cave were destroyed in the bombing of Berlin. That argument may have held some water in the 20's, but not after WWII."
5,Helps keep the original images fresh,"We saw the exhibit in September and I bought the book as a reminder of the awe and joy I felt looking at the originals. The book lives up to the exhibit. A feast for the eyes, the book captures well the power and talent of Pyle and the Wyeths."
5,Truly captures the essence of Wyeth!,"This book is a collection of the paintings included in an exhibit which will be at the Delaware Art Museum in December -- works by Howard Pyle, N.C. Wyeth, Andrew Wyeth, & Jamie Wyeth, chosen particularly because of their ""wondrous"" and ""strange"" way of looking at the world. A glossy, colorful, and exciting book featuring the progression of artistic technique from generation to generation! Something of interest for everyone."
1,Terrible!,"I purchased this for my per-k class. The pages sat side by side (2 pages at once). This was extremely confusing for a 4 year old. I downloaded this book to my iPad so the children could use it at the listening center. Well, there was nothing to listen to!, I do not advise purchasing this book. To say the least, I was extremely dissatisfied. I would rate this zero stars but my review needed at least one star to be accepted."
5,Still using after ten years.,I have used this book and cassette set for a decade now with my own children and day care children. it is always a big hit. You wont go wrong adding this to your collection. Or ordering the cd set.
5,Cute for preschoolers....,"My three year old daughter loves this book. It has cute illustrations and an easy to follow story line, just like I remember. This is great book for both boys and girls."
3,why abridge the original?,"Funny illustrations, of course; done by a master. However, the Kindle edition is slightly abridged, and the deleted sentences and phrases (which are merely repeated sentences and phrases) reduce the humor when read aloud. Yes, yes, reduce the humor when read aloud....BTW, we have the print original (now appropriated by one daughter/mother) with which to compare."
5,Three Little Kittens,"I picked the book, THREE LITTLE KITTENS, so my Grandchildren would have another book on my Kindle Fire to read. The 5 year old is able to read it and loves the story."
4,has the measure of KM as a person ...,"Sharply critical of KM's behaviour at times, but has the measure of the person. Is stronger on the person and her milieu than on the writer ..."
4,cant move figure...but great detail and appearance,"i gave it a overall 4 as u cant move it so its only gd for display but its colours, pose , appearance rox!"
2,"Made my hair thicker, but clumped and lost more hair","I was shedding more than usual from stress and decided to try this product. It made my hair feel and look great, but it also caused my hair to knot and then the knots/clumps would fall out. I thought it was part of my hair loss until I was traveling and did not bring this product with me. Sure enough, when I didn't use it, no knots and clumps. To be totally sure, when I got home I tried it one last time and it happened again. It must be because it is glue like. If you are having this problem while using this product, try stopping and see what happens."
5,Worth every single penny,I just got this in last week. I've ready from other reviews that it should take around a month or so for you to see the results after consistent application however I am seeing the results already. Not 1..not 2...not 3...but 4 different friends have commented on the thickness of my hair and I have thinning hair in the back. I start by applying it on the balding area first right after the shower then I mix it in with my hands. I use this with Toppik hair fibers and it has made a complete 180 degree turn with my appearance. 10 out of 10 stars IMO.
2,Have not noticed anything,"I already have thick hair but am always looking for more volume. I was impressed by some of the reviews on here an decided to give it a try. I haven't really noticed any difference in my hair. I still continue to use it because it says with continued use your hair can get up to 70% thicker but I don't know. Maybe it only works for people with thinner hair to begin with. It's too expensive for me to buy with no results. I do love the smell and it certainly hasn't damaged my hair and has good ingrediants so I'm going to keep using until I run out. Maybe after I don't use it anymore I'll be able to tell a difference, but as for right now I'm sad to say I'm not thrilled."
5,Great product that really works...,Wonderfull Product that really gives volume to my thinning hair. My mother even tried it (and she isn't thinning.. but she was well pleased with the product...5 stars... and with this product... Less is more... if you take to much your hair can get hard to style...
5,The BEST - Use everyday!,"Have very thin, fine hair and have tried EVERYTHING under the sun. Get this product and you will NOT be sorry."
4,Makes hair thicker,"Makes hair thicker, more texture. Great price and only need a little of the product to use. Would buy again."
2,Meh...,"This stuff is just ok. It smells nice. It gets hard when it dries, kind of like hair gel, if you use too much. I'm not sure it really makes the Toppik fibers stick better, or if it makes it so you don't have to use as much. If it does, I can't really tell a difference from when I don't use it. I purchased this stuff a year and a half ago, and I still have it."
3,Okay.,"Does okay job. Really, it just coats your hair with product to give the illusion of thicker hair, but in reality that stuff will come off in the shower. Weighs your hair down to the point where attempting to style it would be futile."
1,Misrepresented by other buyers,"As a woman with thinning hair it's vital that I find a good product to make it look thicker. I don't know how other buyers on here can rate it so highly when it makes your hair look and feel like you haven't washed it in a week. With such a greasy look too, it makes your hair look thinner than ever. One of the worst hair products I've ever bought (second only to one that made my hair break off)."
1,"Doesn't work, see review for alternatives","This would only work if you have minimal hair thinning problems. (like no scalp shows to begin with). No better than ""Cowboy magic"" hair shiner (thin consistency reflects how its NOT going to work).If you have more severe thinning problems, use this:Samy Fat Hair Creme Thickening 3.5 ozAfter you shower & towel dry your hair, use some spray on detangler ie: No More Tangles (so as to not pull your fine wispy hair out combing it wet), then get a dime to quarter size of this, smear it in your palms, gently work it in your hair & leave it in (this is important!). Let your hair dry.May take a little longer to dry, but the feeling & look of fullness & thickness is worth it if you have thin hair."
1,sticky,I found this product made my hair sticky. Very little thickening. I didn't like this at all. I know you are only supposed to use a tiny amount but still did not like the feel of it in my hair.
2,"If you have a PS2, or a DVD player, DON'T buy this!","I was very excited when the box first arrived at our doorstep. My eight year old son and I managed to get the unit put together, after a little tugging to get some of the screws to go into place. We carried it up to his room, and put the T.V. and V.C.R. into place. My excitement turned to bitter dissapointment, however, when I tried to fit my son's PS2 games into the shelves desighned to hold CD's or VCR tapes. The PS2, and DVD cases are too big to fit into these slots. I had just not realized that they would not work with this model. The whole reason I ordered this unit was too try to organize some of the mess in his room, so this will not work for me. I will probably try to return it, and order the newer model."
5,awsome!!!!!!!!!!,"this thing is incredible it makes everything easier with whatching tv to playing video games i recommend this to all my friends they all have them for their 20'' tv they have their dvd player,vcr,tv,playstation 2,all the games and videos and dvds this thing is so cool but one thing i dont like about it is i dont like the coloring i want it all to be black and red but thats me and it needs more shelves to put stuff on like stereo equipment and stuff like that i think you should buy this product"
1,BAD FIT,"I purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old's room. He has a 19 inch TV/VCR/DVD combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a ""20 inch"" TV. If you have a modern TV with speakers on the side it will not fit!!!!! I purchased the item directly from STEP2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item!!!!"
3,A Very Well Written Yet One Sided of the MAN.,"Although this book was very easy to read, excluding the very boring aspect of the Seven Days Campaign which was very hard to understand, the book made Longstreet seem like the bad man in every situation. This book even made Longstreet seem bad at Fredricksburg, quite possibly one of the greatest defensive stands ever. The authors clearly do not like Longstreet and show it throughout the book. However, I am a Longstreet and Civil War fanatic and I would still suggest you read this book just to get everyone's opinion on the controversy that is James Longstreet."
1,AN ESSAY ON FALSEHOODS,"In all my studies of Longstreet and, indeed, the war itself, I have never run across a more complete essay on flasehoods. There is little doubt as to why there are no footnotes, the book is not based upon fact. It is purely a work of fiction at its worst. It is a character assasination of James Longstreet and certainly not worth the time required to read. I found no redeeming qualities whatsoever in this compilation of half-truths, inuendos and outright lies based solely upon an agenda to rake a historical name through the muck and an attempt to shift all the blame for Gettysburg, indeed the entire war, onto Longstreet. If you wish to read about general Longstreet, I suggest your time be better spent elsewhere."
2,Lost Cause Biography,"The first major book written about General Longstreet, it is an adequate read, but A.J. Eckenrode's bias against Longstreet is pretty strong and not particularly objective at this stage of the game. The author was definitely influenced by the anti-Longstreet writings of the time. More objective biographies and other books on Longstreet have been written in recent decades, with more research to boot. I found some of the explanations of the complex battles wanting. If you have a good working knowledge of the big battles you will find things missing in this book with a few of confusing narratives. Unless you are one to own every book on a particular figure in the war, this one is not a must."
2,Poor Quality,"This item was not made well. The elbow, knee and shoulder pads are made of some sort of foam that tears easily. These parts of the costume were ripping as the costume was pulled out of the packaging and while it we were putting it on. It's a very expensive costume considering the quality."
1,DO NOT BUY VERY CHEAP AND MISLEADING ADVERTISING,The helmet on this thing was a piece of crap. it.s flimsy and its way too huge! in the picture it looks smaller and looks like a good fit! in reality its twice that size and looks like you're on DK Mode! the shoulder pads on the jump suit where where your biceps go and there were no gloves or vinyl belt. Dont order this crap! i'm returning mine now!
4,great costume,This is a great costume!! My 12 year old wore it to his Halloween dance and it was a hit. The only reason I would hesitate to give it 5 stars is that the mask was a little less durable than I would have expected.
2,They ALRIGHT!,The sweater was ok. Even through the senders sent me the wrong size. I order a 5xl and got a 4xl.
1,Was not heavy at all,I was extremely unhappy. This hoddie was not heavy at all. i was expection alot more weight to it. also alot more material. i returned it right away. i work night so i need something thick. and this was far from it
5,perfect hoodies,I got them in less then 24 hours !I want use them for the gym and my work out!! And they are perfect.just got two of them and im gonna get more !
1,Items sent are not as advertised.,"Beware: The hoodie I was sent was NOT the one I purchased! It was not a pullover as in the description but a zippered one. It was not heavy as in the description but a very light and flimsy one. It also was not made by Gildan as in the description but by American Apparel. At first I thought I was simply sent the wrong item, however the tag attached said ""Hooded Pullover Sweat Shirt...."" which it clearly isn't. I'm very disappointed."
1,not very heavy,I wanted heavy sweatshirts. I diddn't get heavy ones. The sweatshirts i got are thin . VERY DISSAPOINTED. DON'T BUY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HEAVY SWEATSHIRT.If you want a light one the quality isn't bad. good for florida bad for illinois!
3,too short and leaves you with questions,"A lot of people fantasize about dropping out of society and going back to the basics and this is why I bought this book. I thought it was going to be interesting to read about somebody who did just that.But after i read the book i was kinda disappointed for what it did NOT contain, for example what happened to the dog? What did Calvin say about her leaving him for another man? What was it like to go without electricity for so long? sooo sooo much was left out.I could have read a book about any typical joe living and making it in the city and got the same amount of enjoyment out of it. Dont get me wrong not all of it was bland there was some very interesting parts to it, thats the reason i gave it three instead of two stars."
3,not what I expected,"I watched a video on tv and wanted more because the film and interview with the author was in sync with my interests.The book was ordered and to my disappointment was very short and life in the swamp was not fleshed out. It was a book for juveniles, a quick superficial treatment which had a number of tacked on post scripts which added a few more pages to this skimpy read.This small volume can't compare with the wonderful richness of a book like ""Spirit of the Siskyous"" by Mary Paetzel. Get that book!"
2,"Buy it if you have money to waste, otherwise...","I'll start off with the pros: very good quality that I can see will last me a lifetime, and saves time when working on older bottom brackets.Like the Park Tool double-sided headset wrench, however, this tool is an extreme uni-tasker that I only use because I feel like I need to use it after wasting my money. The pin spanner is only one size, which runs the risk of being useless if the bottom bracket needs a different size - a much better option is buying the Park Tool adjustable pin spanner, which fits every size. As for the other end, I give the same alternative to the headset wrench: a 12 - 15 inch adjustable wrench that has the added leverage to produce much more torque on extremely tight bottom bracket cups.Again, if you work on bottom brackets frequently or simply have money to waste, then buy it. Otherwise get yourself a 12 -15 inch adjustable wrench and save yourself some money."
2,Not too happy.,"This tool broke the second time I used it, not too impressed. Normailly I would endose Park Tools, I have been using them for over twenty years."
3,good,"tool is about 2mm larger than the bottom bracket cup, but it works anyway if you use it carefully and with a spacer to hold it in place."
5,Great Perspective,"I enjoyed the alternative viewpoint given in this book. In a book with a clear and easy to read format, I learned a better way to enjoy lifting. I recommend New Rules for persons weary of the current (old) thought process on lifting. Personally, the training program seems useful in breaking above current plateaus."
5,Excellent Information,"The information is very easy to read and understand, even for the lay person just starting to get into weight training and total body fitness.As a physical educator and a lifelong learner, I believe that I owe it to myself as well as to my students to continue learning about the human body and how we can best train our bodies to be as healthy as possible. This book definitely will assist in helping anyone who is truly interested in maximizing their overall level of physical fitness.This is a must read for anyone looking to improve themselves or who is just beginning to train!"
2,Same old problem.,"Once again, I like the workout ideas in this book, but the routines won't work in a commercial gym. When I try superset or circuit routines like those in this book, I always have the problem with other gym members occupying the next machine or free weight area I'm about to go to next in the routine. These types of routines (circuits, supersets) are useful for home training but not at a busy gym."
4,Solid information,"This is a straight foreword meat and potatos kind of program flexible enough to last a lifetime. I have two B.S. degrees one in physical education and the other in sports medicine. I worked in physical therapy field for over 4 years. The gym is probably the greatest place to get the worst possible advice on strength training. This is a great book based on proven science and avoids the ""miracle program dogma"". Although Schuler's prose can be a little silly at times it is based on tons of reseach facts. This will remain in my library for regular use and reference."
4,Logical Extension of T-A-P,"I've read and enjoyed several of Lou's other books, I like his style of writing and find his work entertaining and informative. This book, to me, is the logical successor to his popular Testosterone Advantage plan. The diet advice and planing is similar but updated, and the exercise plans follow a similar periodization scheme. Fat loss circuit, Hypertrophy, and low reps for strength. While there is a break in routine, I would not recommend this book to some one who has not worked out regularly for at least six months. But for some one looking to move from beginner to intermediate, or an intermediate looking for a change of pace, this would be an outstanding resource."
2,Not so hot,"Page 13. of the book, ""when I conceived this book I had a brilliant premise: I would take every excersive in the gym and look at it in terms of possible role in human movemement."" Then later goes on on to list the moves they think are important, even debating what should be included. There is no scientific method to this, only apparently two individuals conceiving an idea for a book. I'm sure there strength books are good, but this a ""me too"" book on core performance."
1,not happy with the book.,"I was expecting this to be an easy read and easy to follow workout program,but this was not the case.They gave you workouts telling you to do 2or3 or4 times a week and this was misleading. Im more advanced and wasent sure what to do. I would stay away from this book."
1,No usefull information,"This book has very little useful information in it. It proposes a bunch of exercises based on ""natural"" everyday movements and discourages focused single muscle exercises or anything involving sitting (i.e. rowing). NO SCIENCE nor does the author quote any studies to support his exercises.Author is not an expert nor a real body builder. Co-author might be but is pretty uninvolved in writing the book.Big print. Lots of words. Nothing useful to a beginner or a pro."
1,Garbage,This is the worse bodybuilding book that I have ever read it's garbage. The authors used the same idea that came out over 30 years ago it never caught on because the idea sounds great but has no substance they should never write a book again.
1,Author seems to be a bs artist.,"First of all post a shirtless pic of the author, who might not be in shape. Second simply define full rest superset in one sentance! The Author seems to know he goofed and then goes on this scatterbrained tirade about people not having basic information. lol Quit the bs dude and simply define your terms!! I still can't make out from your scatterbrained english (no not having basic subject verb predicate sentances does not make you seem 'in the know). Who has gotten ripped from this plan? Has the author? Or is this another pseudo science money making essay??"
4,Good Book,"Good book for the starter or those who are overcomplicating their workouts.To sum up the concept ... the typical person does not need to mess with a bunch of single exercises that focus on individual muscles, your best bang for your time is to work with a smaller menu of big move, basic exercises.djh"
5,Touched the Rim,"I am very excited! After doing the workouts in this book for 1 month, I already see a difference. My shirts fit more snug and I just touched the basketball rim for the first time since high school. I'm 27. Not a big deal for most but for a 5'10"" white guy I'll take it."
4,Very Good Muscle / Training book backed by Science,"Probably one of the best books (but not the 'final word'. When that book will appear is anyones guess!) for those interested in strength training or hypertrophy training. The book is backed by references, science and honesty (such as 'we simply do not know the reasons why xyz occurs.....' etc). A very easy read which is well balanced with a list of exercises and programs. Thankfully it has no association with the Men's Health books which I find can be very poor at times. Finally, the 'writer's humour' (which actually seldom pops up) is probably more geared to dry English/Australian/Canadian humour than US humour which appears to have put a number of US (I presume) off, based on some reviews. I found it to be harmless and simply a way to engage the reader."
5,good book,This book was very informative for me. The author makes it a very easy read with humor. The workouts kick my butt in the gym. Definately recommend.
5,Outstanding Book,This book covers a great common sense approach to lifting. Lou lays out a great basic program for different levels of experience. I would highly recommend this book.
4,The New Rules of Lifting not Entirely New,"This is a good book for beginning to intermediate lifters. It is well written and easy to read with a minimum of lingo and with some humor as well. It is one of the best books on lifting that I have read. I recommend it with the caveat that it doesn't really contain a lot that is new. Lifts are lifts and pretty much all that can be said about sets, reps and routines has been said."
3,Overrated,"I'm not sure why this book has gotten such incredible praise in the majority of it's reviews. Although this book touts ""New Rules,"" much of it seems like old news to me. Most experienced lifters are probably already doing the exercises described, however; the book does give good information on the underlying reasons why these exercises are better than others. Overall an informative book, but more targeted towards beginners. Also has a negative bias against bodybuilders."
2,Get ready to wade through a TON of info,"It was way longer than it needed to be, imo. There were so many ""new rules"" introduced, I lost track after about 15. Not an enjoyable read for me."
3,"good information, but can do without the crude language","The information presented was sound. The workout plans were great, easy to follow and did not consume your life. I appreciated the pictures and explanations on how to do each exercise. My one complaint was the crude language the author used. It added nothing to the point he was trying to make, but just turned my husband and me off."
2,Chatty and self promoting style hides a few good parts,"The book has some helpful exercises, but the prejudices of the author are given way too much ink. The author also spends too much time discussing his own contributions to the topic. In total this makes for boring reading and calls his competence into question in many areas. However, there are some good exercises that could be done at home with free weights and some credible suggestions for training. But the book is to be read with common sense and skepticism liberally applied."
3,Recycling matters,"Great info if you're new to the lifting world, but it's the same information over and over from one of the authors. Refreshing to see Alwyn though, he does add a bit more to the mix. I think Lou has run his course unfortunately, and has never been the same since leaving a previous magazine."
5,Maitresse extraordinaire!!,"E.C. Jacquet de la Guerre was a great composer in her time, and her music stands out as some of the most successful compositions by a female in France before the 19th century. This is an excellent recording, I especially enjoyed the Sonade in d for the violon. If you have not heard her music before, I strongly suggest you pick up this CD and give it a listen. You'll be glad you did."
3,Kelly Green Turtleneck,The Shirt took awhile to arrive. The shirt itself was the rightcolor but only ok in quality.
1,Rip off,"When I saw the price of roughly $30, I thought that's reasonable for a case of six, as that is about what I used to pay when buying refills at Target. Imagine my dismay when the package arrived with one lousy refill! Very disappointed! I guess it was my fault for assuming I was getting a case, but $30 for one refill--I could have just upgraded to a new Diaper Genie for that price. Boo. Hiss!"
2,didn't like it,I ordered the wrong refill. my mistake. I now have the refill for the original. It did work with a little more effort by hand
4,...,"Parents, if you are thinking about getting this for your son or daughter, don't. Why? because my friend got it, thinking it's a Tony Hawk clone, but this was actually a RACING game, so unless your kid likes racing against the clock, dont buy it. I would reccomend buying Advance Wars instead, because it's a turn-based strategy game, so they don't need hand-eye coordnation, but instead , think..."
3,Just too much to cram in,"I am a big fan of the original changing breed books. This book is almost a travesty to their name. By trying to fit in every single other type of shapeshifter, they give none the space it needed. The book serves well if you plan on using the other shapeshifters as NPCs, but if you want one as a PC, then ignore this book and get the specific book that just covers that one specific type."
3,toddler sleeping bag,"I like this but I didn't realize that there wasn't a zippered opening on this sleeping bag. Once I put a zipper in it I think it'll be great. It's a good size and comes in it's own storage bag, which is nice."
5,I love Three's Company,Great season!! It's one of those shows that you either loved or hated....I personally loved it. Mindless fun to watch.
5,Classic TV,"A must for any John Ritter fan, or anyone who enjoys classic television. The laughs never stop coming. I intend to purchase all eight seasons."
3,Hot and cold,"Some feel that this is the best season of ""Three's Company,"" but I'm not sure that I can go that far. It certainly has some of the best individual episodes. The one where the old roommate visits, and the episode when Jack's roommates mistakenly think that he has fallen for a senior citizen, are classics.Probably the single thing that makes this season so appealing is the increasing importance of Larry's role. Richard Kline added a good lower-key compliment to John Ritter, Joyce DeWitt and Suzanne Somers, who--too often in this season--went way over the top.This season marks the Ropers' final one as regular players. The fourth season introduces new landlord Ralph Furley. The show never was the same since, as everything became overdone and over-silly. Somers' departure a little while after that totally killed the series."
5,LOVE IT,This season is great! It is very funny and the extras are cool. The end is sad because the ropers sell the building. But it is worth buying.
4,Colorful and cute !,The arrangement of colors of the beads makes the whole necklace look so lovely.Whoever loves pink will like this one. It actually makes you look happy and younger!
1,Don't buy this book if you want an insider's viewpoint,"I thought this book would show an insider's view of the top ten attractions in each category, instead, it shows the top ten ""most popular"" even though the author, who is a former marine, doesn't agree in the descriptions that the hotels, restaurants, and attractions are worthwhile. The hotel recommendations are the worst part of the book, most of the hotels on the list are major chains and the author doesn't seem to have ever stayed in most of them, and the descriptions mention that some of them are overpriced and dirty. This book was a complete waste of money. Also, the author does not provide website addresses for many of the listings, only phone numbers. I had to buy another book in order to find a hotel that was under $400 per night that wasn't a major chain, youth hostel, or YMCA."
3,Songwriter-singer/stylist in classy minimalist setting,"The worldweary lyrics blend into beautiful, plaintive, acoustic playing.I had the chance to see Amy live in Fords, New Jersey, and the short set really worked. This long-player tends to work as a nap-inducer: that's not a bad thing, but you're gonna miss some very pleasing sounds.We have a West to East Coast thing happenning, with the atmosphere of a Montana backporch. ""59th Street"", ""Coney Island..."", ""Dollar Lake"", and the CD namesake are warm black and white recollections (the cover art says it all) of quiet times and quiet people. Maybe a little *too* quiet for Amy's understated insistence.I enjoyed her dignified folk-blues (blues without the chord progressions) live. This CD is enjoyable, though (for me) not in one take. Fans of Melanie Safka will have a field day listening to an often uncannily similiar sound and poetic approach. That's the *East* Coast calling."
2,Still waters don't always run deep,"In response to those who think that the less than favorable reviews of Lakeville are somehow tied to expectations of a recycling of Carinval Love -- I say baloney! (though I never eat the stuff)At least in my case, I'm giving this album two stars because it is dull, dull, DULL - and I'm a guy who likes dull. Heck, I read Thomas Hardy for FUN. I expected the unique arrangements and the fascinating storylines of songs like Carnie's ""The Bike"", but they are almost entirely absent. In trying to sand off the rough edges, Lakeville leaves us with a pile of dust. I love her voice, and gosh knows I have listened to Lakeville several times over the past few months, hoping it would grow on me the way Carnival Love did (an album which I disliked so much the first time I heard it that I darn near tossed it out the window). I don't mean to be, well, mean, and I fully expect that she will not disappoint with her future work, but I was not at all taken with this album."
5,Awesome worship and testimony!,This dvd touches everyone who sees it! You see how intimate worship can be and the variety of ways we can worship and how people's lives are touched by the gift of JESUS through GOD's grace! This is fellowhip and worship and communion at its best! You need to see this for yourself. I cant do it justice.
4,Good mindless fun,"This is good fun for boys and girls in that 3-5 year old range. The video isn't too long, the music is cute, and there iAds some great shots. There is a bit too much advertising for the series, and the video doesn't have much of an educational quality."
5,BRILLIANT,"I agree with everything the other reviewer wrote - except that you dont need Polish to love this album. I dont speak polish and this album is one of my favorites, its brilliant. buy immediately, love forever. really, this man has an astounding depth of talent. i cant really even begin to describe this music - its wild, unpredictable and totally beautiful. (and he has many other great albums, so if you love this one, dont be hesitant to try more.)"
2,All of her books are the same story,"I greatly enjoyed the book ""Yarn-Remembering the Way Home"" but all the books that Kyoko has written are the same thing-whether fiction or nonfiction. They're about her mother's suicide, how Koyko felt, moving to the U.S., etc. Reading about it once was enjoyable. Reading the same story in all of her books is very redundant. Kyoko obviously has many emotional issues concerning her childhood."
2,The book of whine,"I sympathize with Kyoko Mori's troubling childhood, but enough is enough. She whines, wimpers and complains throughout the entire book, and demonstrates neither compassion nor maturity. Halfway through the book, I began to wonder when the ""breakthrough"" would come. The answer comes in the final pages, when she throws away a arguably ugly piece of jewelry given to her by her hated stepmother--the ""breakthrough"" would never come. I began to tire of the author's consistent whining, moaning, complaining and self-pity. Many women have had troubled childhoods, Ms. Mori, and they have managed to get on with their lives. Your inability to do so was a disappointment."
4,Emotional and Provocative,"The Dream of Water"" was chosen by my teacher to read in our 12th grade English class. There was a big gap between those who loved it and those who thought it was simply a waste of time. People who enjoyed the book really got into the story right away. It's not a very difficult book to read. However, if after reading a few chapters, it seems boring, I suggest finding a different book to read.I think it is wonderfully written, very provocative. Kyoko has a way of writing that engages the readers. Her emotions are expressed very strongly and magnificently."
5,"So touching, So Detailed","Kyoko Mori is an excellent writer. If you like Asian/ Japanese cultures and are interested in reading about it, this is the book for you. It's a sad tale/story about how Mori had to leave her life in Japan all because of her father and her ""EVIL"" stepmother. She returns to a sense of alienation. She somewhat regrets leaving but also thought it was for the best. This book relates to history of WWII, Japanese culture, lives of people back then."
1,A Book To Miss,This is an ambomination of literature. The story is bad.!!! I dont mean just an ordinary bad book but a rather uninspiring book that only makes the children in this world even more depressed then they used to be. This is a sad day for me. This review is SO over!
1,dream of water,"this book was very touching but, it sucked. after reading it i thought about the time i wasted, and what i could have done. this would be a good punishment for bad kids. like myself, you teachers did a good job i am well punished, i hate you."
3,Useful book,"This edition is essentially identical with the previous one. It is a useful book, but still not difficult enough to reflect the extreme complexity of the Pathology board exams."
5,don't take my word for it...,"The clarity and simplicity of Pretty Flowers is well matched with their confrontational song titles. From the existential cat-fight ""Slut"" to the obstreperous and contemplative ""Laura's Bush,"" it sounds like the sort of music that comes from little cranked Peaveys in garages and coffee shops. Energetic enough that it rocks, yet trash poppy enough that it is not overwhelming. Good solid bass lines hold it all together as both male and female vocals spout pretty catchiness.- The Deli Magazine"
5,More cowbell.,"love. LOve. LOVE. This band has the best fanbase ever. Blood, sweat, and tears went into this EP. We hope you feel it. It's all for you. -Pretty Flowers"
1,"No Way, No How, Never, Not In a Million Years.","Like most of the other reviewers, I learned about this CD when the band's bassist began spamming websites with fake reviews. The problem is that people actually began listening to the music -- and it's so incredibly bad that it quickly became an internet joke. Check out the clips yourself. I've never before heard a band try to execute saccharine-sweet (albeit out of tune) vocal harmonies while billing themselves as a punk act. This CD is good for a quick laugh, but you'd have to be nuts to spend real money on it."
5,Violent Femmes-ish,"So I take one one one cause you left me andTwo two two for my family and3 3 3 for my heartache and4 4 4 for my headaches and5 5 5 for my lonely and6 6 6 for my sorrow and7 7 for no tomorrow and8 8 I forget what 8 was for and9 9 9 for a lost God and10 10 10 10 for everythingEverything everything everythingSadly, it only goes to 5."
3,Good Small Books!,"These books are great for young readers with good eyes. To read aloud to a group of children the pictures are too small in this four pack and the words are a bit small to glance at to read. I Liked all the books, they were just more compact than what I was needing them for."
3,OK Product,I was disappointed with how thin and cheap this bundt pan is. I am afraid the finish will start chipping off. I know I could find a nicer pan in the stores for the price I paid for this one.
4,Great pan,"Awesome! It is lighter than I thought but that makes it easier to handle. I have used it twice and both times the cakes have baked perfectly and came out easily and with no sticking.They pick the color. I got yellow, nice sunshine splash of color. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I just saw in it Walmart the other day for a couple dollars less and that one had more color choices and little helper handles,though I'm not sure they were necessary. I like as well that it is made in America."
4,pleased with product,"Overall Im very pleased with this product. My only complaint is that I thought I would be getting a red pan but instead I was sent a yellow pan. When I inquired about this I was told that it said ""assorted colors"" and no matter what color I requested or searched for that I could have been sent any color. Besides the color Im very happy with the pan. It cooks evenly and is pretty durable."
1,Cakes do not come out easily,"This pan was purchased as a gift off of my wish list. I thought that because it was nordic ware, it would be a great pan. However, I've made 3 or 4 cakes with it, greasing the pan carefully, waiting the proper amount of time after baking, and each and every time, either the cake broke in half, or parts of it didn't come out. It is totally not worth the money that was spent on it and I would not recommend it to anyone. I felt compelled to review it so that someone else doesn't make the same mistake. I assume that for $5 more, maybe $10, a cake pan that does the job it's supposed to.I didn't experience anything in regards to the cake falling apart, but this experience certainly wasn't like with my last bundt pan that met an untimely demise. Please don't make the same mistake I did in selecting this one!"
3,You get what you pay for...,"Not the of the highest quality, but it does the job for the occasional baker. It's pretty thin, but the price was right."
1,Worst cake pan I've ever purchased,Worst cake pan I've ever owned -- cake sticks to the pan -- won't come out without falling apart. What a wsste of money - save yours & buy a different pan!
4,Good light weight,"Good light weight bundt pan. light weight but seams to be made to last . it is made with the traditional shape, there are more that have more intricate shape but they were more expensive."
5,Great,"Mother loved it. favorite color is red and it was the perfect Christmas gift, yes we had Christmas early lol"
2,disappointed,It's very light weight...almost flimsey. Came with a couple of scuffs on the edges. The first time I used it my cake did not fully come out and I had to piece it back together. I like the heavier pans better.
5,Bundt Pan,"I recently purchased this bundt pan for my wife. She really likes it a lot; and the color too. I do quite a bit of shopping through Amazon.com, and I have always been pleased with quality and price."
3,Not what I was looking for,Not a bad product but it was mislabled. The description stated that it was 82L x 63W which was not the case. The window in my daughters room is large so I need curtains atleast 82L. This curtain was only 63L so needless to say I couldn't use and had to return it.
4,Bell 2-bicycle hitch rack,"For the money, this is a very good rack. It is sturdy and very easy to use. The swing-away feature makes is easy to access the rear of the vehicle."
2,Bike Rack,The Bell Hitchbiker is medium rack at the best. Was disapointed in the manner the bike attached to the rack. I believe the Velcro hold downs were not sufficient to hold bike on rack. I tied the bike to the rack with pieces of rope.
2,bike rack,The item I ordered said it would fit a 1 1/4 to 2 inch hitch. I Have a 2 inch hitch and the bike rack did not fit secure. I had to tie it to the car so it would not move. even then it still swayed side to side on my trip. I was wondering if there is anything you can do.
4,Worked for me,"We have used this rack on several trips and had no absolutely no problems with it. We used bungee cords to secure the wheels. We traveled on a variety of surfaces, from relatively smooth highways to bumpy dirt roads."
4,Bell Hitchbiker 2-bike hitch mount rack,"Pros:-Easy to assemble.-Strong and well built-Light weight-Great valueCons:-Need extra bungee cord to secure bikes-Hitch pin is threaded so I need to carry a wrench to remove/install (I don't keep the rack on the car all the time)-Rack sways at highway speedsOverall:Like it a lot. Wanted a simple 2 bike rack and this delivered. Just need to do a little extra to make sure everything is secured the way I like it (extra bungee cord, adding rubber washers to the tilt pin will firm up the rack and stop the swaying)."
3,hitchbiker 2-bike mount rack,"I does what it is supp0sed to do, but the bikes slide back andforth and it is a little wobbly in the hitch. You need to makeadjustments so it doesn't scratch your car."
2,Bell Htchbiker,Packaging torn and open. Product had broken plastic parts. I wanted to return but the packaging is messed up. Caqn you do something about it?
4,BUY THE ENGLISH IMPORT,"Great show, but if you want the complete show and have an all region dvd player , spend the extra bucks to get the English Import!!! Missing from the American release of this show are 5 songs. Say You Dont Mind, Misty Roses, Old and Wise, Just Out of Reach, and Summertime. The performance, video and sound are however brilliant. I only gave the American release 4 stars because of the hatchet job they did to this dvd. Too bad!!! Dont understand why this was done!!!"
5,Zombie Magic,"The Zombies Are a perfect example of 60's and 70's groups that will never die. Like a fine wine they get better with age. The song selection and sound is the best you can get for a couple of ""Old Farts."" They sound almost like the singers they were over 30 years ago. I think they are better because they have mellowed out just fine. If you enjoyed the Zombies of the 60's then you will just love Live From Bloomsbury Theatre. Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent will live forever in song and in our hearts."
4,Rod Argent still very good,I thought this dvd was very good and the quality was very good.The sound was excellent .I wish more bands would record their concerts because to see some of these bands you would have to travel across the country .Again I thought this dvd was very good and I was glad I bought it.
2,Not quite there,I expected more. Many of the DVDs that I have purchased of classic bands have been a joy. This one falls short. Yes the band still has a jazzy style and play a number of great hits. The musicianship however is without emotion. That would be acceptable. The lead vocal is painful to listed to . Off key on its own but ruins the harmonies. Many of the songs just had to be skipped over. Usually I play concerts many times. This one will sit forever.
3,"Simple and visually very nice, but...",the book totally ignores one of the biggest micronesian countries...the Marshall Islands. Could you do Polynesia without Tahiti
1,Not first quality!,"These towels are obviously seconds. I ordered several bath and hand towels, as well as washcloths. Upon receipt I opened several. Each had clearly visible thin spots as well as many pulled threads. I was very disappointed and shipped them back."
5,Essential Compilation by Barry Myers,"Great release from Trojan. These are classic CDs compiled by Barry ""Scratchy"" Myers. The tracks found here are very inspiring. Many DJs would love to have these tunes on their sound system. Most of the songs sound crisp and clear, the old suddenly sounds new again. Anyone interested in musical scenes inspired by the sound of reggae, ska and dub should really check these babies out. Barry Myers surely knew his stuff so well: this seminal compilation was thoroughly researched and programmed. The songs are tied together to work like movements in symphony. The insert would also delight its readers with cool graphics, story and musical insight written by Myers himself."
1,twice broken,"I work in a special ed school and thought this was a good idea. But it has broken twice, without any abuse. I sent it back to the manufacturer to be repaired- they kept it for months and I had to call for it to get it back. It was fixed upon return but in a few weeks no longer worked again. Too bad- it was a good idea."
4,took 2s for my son to start using,"First thoughts:So it took my 5yo son two seconds to start using it. I asked him what he thought and he said he likes it.The only thing is it does take him some ""reaching"" in order to click.So he uses two hands.Will follow up later....(above mar 13 2012)-----------edit 10/4/2012so far it still works.When I use it, I feel its a bit taxing to press the buttons.I may switch to a different trackball soon. It becomes difficult to use. Still, its great for beginning (small) children because of the large yellow ball.Buy it for your small child. Then ebay it."
4,A great device for kids (three and over),"We bought this device to introduce our daughter to the computer. She had a lot of trouble using it at first (she was 2 1/2 at the time -- which is too young). Now that she is 3 1/2, she uses it very effectively to navigate basic programs(she uses it primarily to keep up with her Facebook account).The trackball moves very smoothly and the buttons are easy to push. It works well with Macintosh computers. There are no software drivers needed.It's very durable and has a good rolling action. overall, it's the perfect device to get your kids working with computers."
2,Not A Bad Try,"This is one of Bill Shatner's ""Tek War"" series' books. It is not bad, but also not particularly memorable. For all those Star Trek fans out there, don't bother, as this is nothing like Star Trek . . . although if Shatner hadn't been riding on his Star Trek fame, this book would have probably never have been published. His writing style is very gritty, something like Robert Heinlein, although not quite as bad. The book is really more of a detective/police story (the ""T.J. Hooker"" influence, no doubt) set in the future. If you like police stories, you might like this, but frankly, I was not much impressed."
4,Best GBH Album Made,"By far, the best GBH album made. It's about pure energy, and hard-driving GBH not found on their other releases. My favorite GBH album that for some reason was either ignored, or got a bum rap. I could listen to this album a million times and never get tired of it. I wish that they had stayed more with this sound than some of their other releases (and don't get me wrong, I love GBH)."
4,Midnight Madness blah blah blah.,"If you are not a G.B.H. fan, and or you are looking for the usual sounding punk from this time period; you will not like this album!On the other hand; If you like metal, and or hard driving rock then you will.I picked this up out of some nostalgia over my school years spent listening to this album over and over on a cassette tape, it's a c.d. but the sound quality is no better!With all that said; this is in my top ten favorite albums!G.B.H. really know how to put out an album, and in spite of the funky mixing job, this is worth picking up if you want something from that time period that sounds more underground than it was."
4,HOW TO PROFIT FROM THE ART PRINT MARKET,THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK AND A I WILL READ IT AGAIN TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDINGOF THE THINGS I NEED TO KNOW.
3,Not Bad,"A very straight-forward dictionary of angels from a variety of belief-systems. This book is not intended for angelology, but instead serves as a reference work for those casually interested in the topic."
3,"An Incomplete List of the ""Common"" Angels","This is a book of incomplete list of ""common"" angels. Very disappointing."
3,NOT Koralia 1.,Note to buyers: This is not a Koralia 1 Powerhead. They send you a Koralia Nano 425 GPH Powerhead. Gave it 3 stars because the customer service was decent and because they are refunding my purchase.
3,decent (at most) powerhead,"Let me tell you now, this powerhead is not intended for a 30 gallon or greater. Puts out decent force but not enough for my 30 gallon. Operated fine for about 3 weeks then I noticed a standstill within my tank. Realized the powerhead was not working so I removed it from the tank. Plugged it into another electric socket and realized that the powerhead was broken. Just when I was ready to dump it into the trash, I had an idea of how to fix it, I banged it on the counter a few times and it started to work again. Still working so far but I may need to upgrade depending on what set-up I would like for the near future. Decent powerhead..."
4,Coo,AWESOMENESS!!!!!!! This is the coolest Garfield I've ever read. You should really read these s great book.:) :) :)
1,What a waste of money,"Being from East Germany, I was intrigued by the story line and bought it.Within the first three pages I was wondering what the author is talking about. Beautiful prose or not, too many words required a dictionary for my reading, which can kill not only the most eloquent prose but also the enthusiasm to finish such book. Very disappointing for me."
5,THIS GAME RULES!!!!!!!!!,This game is so cool the annoucers are so relistic and the graphics rock you HAVE to get this game!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a game that is not to be bought it is a waste of money. NHL 2k is better than this version. Dont buy this game.
2,"Yeah, right","believe me, i had high hopes for this game. i'm not going to get all into it because i afraid i will throw my computer through the wall....all i will say is this: this game is [bad]. the gameplay is horrible...player control is horrible...there is NO franchise mode...there is NO create a player mode...the audio is horrible...the commentary is [awful]....i tried to love this game...i really did...but, now i know why EA Sports is the all time king of sim video game hockey. hey look, Visual Concepts is great with the NFL series, but man, stay away from hockey please!!!! i'm going out to buy a PS2, just so i can get back to my EA Sports roots....go ahead and buy this game is you want, but i'm warning you....it's simply [bad]....the controller configuration is horrendous...the player control is comedic....the...game [is awful]peace"
4,Definetly Better,This game was a much bigger improvement upon NHL2K and it was a very fun game to play and i think who ever likes hockey and is a very good sports fan should go out and buy this game.
2,Thankfully I paid less than $6 for this!,"This is 40 minutes of video of Australia - mostly of the interior and some coastline shots. Probably better than the average tourist home movie - but not by much. Some of the scenes probably looked impressive on an IMAX screne, which is apparently what it was made for. In 16:9 it's between 'nice' and 'interesting' but far from stunning.A LOT of kangaroo footage - some bird (mostly flock) foootage. One crocodile snippet that was a big animal. A few lizard shots. Some scenic storm scenes.Unctious narration by Alex Scott - I couldn't take him twice but it depends on what you like I suppose. The back says 75 minutes but that must be with the bonus material.I think it's worth a few $ but never $22 (to me)! Of the half dozen Australia videos I have, this is the bottom of the heap. Get it (only) if you collect everything you can find on Australia."
2,"Dissapointment, thy name is IMAX","Once again, an IMAX documentary where the only thing that seems to matter are pretty pictures. While the image quality is superb it's the only real redeeming feature. There's no real exploration of the ecology of the Outback, there isn't much discussion of the wildlife (yay, kangaroos, yay perenties). What discussion there is is basic, repetitive and about on par with what you'd get in a 3rd or 4th grade science class. It's amazingly pretty, but there's nothing else there. It's like a screen saver for your TV basically.The subtitles were also horrible; words were misspelled, just flat out missing, sometimes out of sync with the audio... I use subtitles because my hearing is so/so, and that was a real pain for me."
2,Infomercial??,"I was disappointed with the DVD, of course the IMAX format is great, stunning images...but there is no life. It comes across as an infomercial on Australia, and we have seen most of the areas pictured many times. Very superficial.I love Australia, a great place to visit, I wanted more of the people, more of the country, more of the history..."
3,Australia: Land Beyond Time (IMAX) [Blu-ray],"I enjoyed this Imax presentation. The piture quality in the 45 min main feature is pin sharp, although it becomes a bit soft on the Imax ""big horizon"" flying scenes, the sound clear and powerful.It presents a good insight to the history and evolution of the landscape and the animals in the various zones around Australia.Additional features included a making of and a B roll, presented in std def and didn't add much to the package."
1,Incredible Let Down,"Australia: Land Beyond Time (IMAX) [Blu-ray]Only 45 minutes of video, not the advertised 75 minutes. I guess they took into account the ""B Roll"" stuff, which did not look like it was filmed in HD. The production was quite bad as well. Look at desert, look at kangaroos, look at desert, look at more kangaroos. No cities, just outback, a few more animals, and a brief lesson on continental drift and quite repetitive concerning...kangaroos. Don't waste your money in my opinion."
3,Only half the story of Australia,"Land yes, people no.......????this video shows the beautiful and interesting land and land creatures of the continent but fails to show that it is inhabited at all. I expected some views of the aboriginals and their history, some mention at least. But by watching this video you have no idea that humans exist on the continent AT ALL!I loved the segments of the formation of the continent, the kangaroos, the birds... but after 30 minutes of this I expected to see the Great Barrier reef, the inhabited areas and some other aspects of Australia. I was left very unfulfilled. Too bad."
1,"Too limited, too short!!","I bought this DVD in anticipation of migrating to Australia. I was expecting a well balanced documentary about Australia: history, wildlife, people, cultures etc. The DVD promises 74 min, so it should be able to cover all that. But after about 30 minutes of in itself interesting material, the DVD was done already. I felt very disappointed, as I expected many more minutes and much more than just a few animals and even some repeating scenes."
4,revived my phone,My old battery which lasted 2 hard years quit and This revived my phone. Seems like a good product but I wish they would quit using nicads and go to lithium ion instead.
2,I couldn't wait for it to be over.,"Nothing much exciting happened in this book. It was about a boy who goes to find his father after his mother and sister die. If you ask me, it was too easy for him to find his father, and Clem's father was too succesful in the end. I don't reccomend it."
1,Low-quality printer. Terrible software,"The printer isn't more than an ordniary inkjet and they changed the ink cartridge size to very small ones so you keep buying them (it seems). But the worst part of this printer is the software that goes with it. If you want to install all the features be ready to let go of 780MB of space!! That has to be bloatware incompetent programming. If you choose the ""light"" version, you'll ""only"" need 384MB of disk space! How can this be???I regret having bought this HP printer and it will be my last from them."
2,Constantly Stuck,"I'm not sure what to say about this. It has been a very frustrating product for me. After every page I print, I get two errors. One says that the ink cartridge cradle cannot move and the other error says paper jam.The paper I have in the tray is not jammed in. I have looked repeatedly for any obstruction. I even shined a flashlight inside and I am baffled as to what is causing the error. No other printer has given me this much frustration.I have sought help and even my sister's husband (computer repair is his specialty!) is confused as to what the problem is. I would not recommend this printer for anyone."
1,Total Rip-Off,I agree with the other reviewers' comments about the ink cartridges. HP has totally scammed their customers by putting so little ink in the cartridges required for this printer. I've had this printer about six months and I've already spent more than the cost of the printer on ink (and it needs more AGAIN).My last printer was from HP and I was happy with it. I got totally burned on this one. Guess what brand my next printer won't be?
1,Another deception from HP,"I had this printer for about 1 1/2 years only and it already broke down. I was never happy with the software it comes with, it is cumbersome, overloads your computer with heavy code that's unnecessary, freezes all the time and takes a whole lot of time to install (and I have a decent 1.8GHz CPU, 1 GB RAM computer). I just wanted something that allows you to scan and print...This is my 2nd HP printer, first one was also a multifunctional and was also frustrated with the software. I decided to go for another HP to give them another chance....but now I'm convinced...will never buy a HP again."
2,what a piece of JUNK,"I've had the printer for some time now & I agree w/ everyone on here who mentioned how fast the ink goes in both color & black but what really makes me mad is that the printer jammed ONE time & now it's busted. When I went to print in sucked in all the paper & now it doesn't work. Thanks for making this in China...like everything else that's made there, it's JUNK."
4,Satisfied with this printer.,I have nothing negative to say about this printer. It works perfectly and I have had no problems. It is quiet and much quicker than my last printer so I am happy. My ink runs out fast but thats because my 8 year old seems to think she has to print everything she sees. [...] Just wanted to pass this info because I am sure there is someone out there that appreciates saving money as much as I do! :)
4,Works Fine!,Nice to have it all together in one package. I will be out of luck if it fails! Service was excellent from Amazon.Don Maxwell
3,You get what you pay for.,Not bad for the price at what I got it for. Not the most reliable unit that one can have but you get what you pay for. Really low price unit that one can use for your kids computer or personal printing. Scanner/copier works well.
2,runs out of ink VERY quickly,"i haven't been having any trouble actually using the printer, however it goes through ink VERY quickly - the HP site reckons you'll get approx 150 pages but i do not think it's anywhere near that. i would be surprised if you get through 50 pages before running out of ink. i'm referring to black ink, i try not to use the colour too much - but it appears to be running out quite fast too. if you want a printer that you can use fairly often (say, 10 pages per week) then i would not recommend this"
3,Good printer for very low volume,"I bought this for home use and it does an okay job, if I had this for work use it would be a nightmare. The main problem is that the printer output drops the printed paged right on top of the feeder tray. Why someone thought this was a wise design choice is beyond me. Basically anytime I print I have to stand there and pull off each page as it comes out or it will get caught in the feeder and jam the printer. Also once the printer has an error that I could not clear despite 30 minutes spent trying everything I could think of. In the end I had to reinstall all the software to get it to work again. As far as quality price though I would recommend this so long as your not printing large amounts off it."
1,Worked well for a while then the scanner broke,I bought this printer around mid 2005. It worked well printing and scanning. My usage is very low - I print a few pages a month and maybe scan a few pages a month.Some time ago the scanner just stopped working - all scanned pages came blank. I tried to contact HP support but they could not fix it - concluding that I should exchange my all-in-one with a new one.I bought an HP because I thought it would be a relable printer for a long time. Now I am stuck with an all-in-one that can print and not scan.
3,Not Worth The Money,"I got this for free with my notebook.As far as a free printer goes, you really can't expect much more. The colors are vibrant enough, and it prints pretty fast. Haven't had any paper jams. The scanner is of fairly high quality as well.However, it does eat up ink a good lot. As a student who has to print out lots of documents for his classes, I just use the college library printers by now, as I doubt this ol' thing could keep enough black ink to last more than 100 pages.Hence, if you're going to use this as your primary printer for all your daily duties, I'd advise you to find a laser printer instead, as those are far more economic on the ink. Given that this model is such an ink-hog, I certainly wouldn't advise buying it for the 80-odd dollars that it costs."
2,Not very useful,"I wish I could have previewed more of this book before I read it. I find it a gross oversimplification of men and women. The world is an ugly place if men and women are of the stereotyped versions featured in this book.A few good things in there, but all in all not worth the effort."
1,"Yes, it did have some humorous remarks...","Since I've read and enjoyed an earlier book by these authors (Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps) I didn't hesitate to grab this one off the shelves. What a waste of money! They just repeat a lot that was said in the book I already had. Also, of all the ""facts"" that are stated I know for sure that at least three of them are total fiction or at best hearsay (these are the only three where I'm an expert) which seriously makes me doubt the validity of the remaining facts. I found this book a very irritating read."
5,This book helped me!,"I like this book and felt there was a lot of truth in what is written about men and women. This book could have been written about my husband! I fit the profile too, and it made me think about how I come across to others. And now that I have read this book I am can understand why we have had so many hassles in the past. The whole time I was reading the book I was nodding my head in agreement, or laughing at the jokes. Everyone should read this at least once in their lifetime."
2,Waste of time!,"A waste of time for anyone married more than 5 years! If you have only a double digit IQ perhaps you should read this book. It is easy to read, but the advice given is nothing more than common sense. (Teach your mother-in-law to walk ten miles/day and after a week she will be 70 miles away). Funny-- 25 years ago!The authors often refer to the fact that men and women are different --- dah! That is why we are attracted to each other! They cite examples to illustrate a point, sometimes helpfull but usually quite mundane.This MIGHT be a good book to give to newly weds!"
4,Having A Clue,"You'll definitely have a better ""clue"" with the Pease's book. Most of the time I found myself saying something like ""OH, that's why"" or ""That makes perfect sense!"" You'll definitely gain a lot of gender insight from this practical book."
5,Enlightening Read,A friend recommended this book to me. He said it was humorous and very accurate.I have found this to be true so far. I haven't finished the book yet. But I can tell you my husband and I were discussing furniture arranging and the conversation could have come straight from the book. I really think this book will help my communication with the opposite sex. You can't beat that.
2,this is not a good enough book for me,"i have a few points that may be valuable for those who are looking for really professional flashcom books:1. the example files that come from this book's website work very poorly due to lack of programming considerations within the book itself. some applications fail to run on the second run because something is wrong with the programming used on the flashcom side or client-side, and the applications simply won't start unless u reload the applications from the server.2. the book does not go thoroughly enough with flashcom applications such as user management in a video conference, and server-side scripts that are required for handling issues such as user log on/off, userid, etc.3. although the book goes to teach real life solutions, but it barely touches the core concept of flashcom applications. i can only comment that this book is on the rim of a glass.i hope my points will be helpful for those who are looking for a really good flashcom books..."
1,This book really good for ... CTO,"Yeah, that's right, CTO only need to know what the FlashComm can do, how they do, but doesn't really need to get dirty like all the programmers out there. So if you are CTO go and get this book, if you want to get dirty with FlashComm then stay away from this book. If you want to buy this book in ""mint"" condition, please contact me (vht@rocketmail.com), I will place this book on ebay for just 10USD."
1,"Bad, poor, and worst",Got this book for free from a friend.Hmm..I wondered why he gave me the book for free.Didn't know until one of my current research's requirements is Flash Comm Server MX.Flipped through the book and I'd have to say:Ewwww..programmers...stay away from this book!!!!It's not worth your money.
2,"great idea, but not for tall people","When i first saw the stronghold system I fell in love with the thought of replacing my thin web suspenders. I bought a pair and awaited there araival, only to find that one size does not fit all. I am 6'3"" and the stronghold system at maxium length fell short of my waist."
4,Stronghold,"Really good system. Capable of supporting lots of weight comfortably. I've read that they don't fit tall guys. I'm 5'8"" and had a lot of strap to cut off. If you're buying a tool belt with your stronghold system get the belt oversized so you can leave it loose and have room to adjust your bags. You will be adjusting for a few weeks to get the perfect fit. I used wax cord to hold accessories in various positions untill I found the most comfort, then I got two-sided rivets from a tack shop and pinned them in place. Sounds like a lot of trouble but when you're done you will find that you almost feel as good with your bags on as you do with them off. P.S. Don't waste your money on the standard suspenders. I reviewed those too"
4,Will Keep You Wet,"I really get a lot of enjoyment wearing my Occ.5055, great weight distribution on the shoulders, and adds to the ""professionalism"". One problem wearing such a rig in sunny southern Calif. Is that it has a tendency to draw out excessive moisture from your body, the ""yoke"" covers a great deal of you back and after wearing it the first few consecutive days I developed a skin rash dead center of my back and on my front shoulders. Aside of this, I still wear it cause it's hard to find a alternative system with the same ""qualities"". As for the ""rivets"" stop by any hobby shop and pick up a few extras or do like I did, use large ""aluminum"" pop rivets to pin down your bags/holsters."
3,"Great system, STAINS YOUR SHIRTS","Great rig, agree with all the reviews. FYI, it will stain everything as you sweat. The red leather has ruined several shirts of mine. And this thing will make you sweat-"
5,Very well written!,I could not put this book down. I would recommend this book to anyone. The author did her homework and the result was a detailed description on the life of these two amazing women. I couldn't get enough and in the end I was sad to end this book.
3,Good chick history,"Think of this as the Gray's Anatomy version of the Elizabeth / Mary saga -- relationships. Hours and hours of relationships. Who's about to get engaged to whom, how do they feel about that, what if they don't marry this one, but that one instead, and what does it all mean about her experience of her developing sexuality. Chick history.Not that there's anything wrong with that. If that's what you like you'll like this book very much. But if you don't like that, this is a good book to avoid.The other folks down here in the 3 star section are correct, for those of us whose thoughts about relationships begin and end with, ""Am I getting any,"" the book is extremely repetitious. And what's repeated over and over and over is detailed picking and turning and prodding and wallowing in the emotional experience of relationships.The research seems to be original and detailed. The writing is excellent. The little islands of history dotting the oceans of relationship stuff, fascinating."
3,"Fascinating topic, iffy writing.","My main complaint about this book is that Dunn constantly repeats herself. Several times per chapter, she will make the same comparisons of Elizabeth's and Mary's pasts, or even more annoying given the barely-there sense of chronology, their futures. This repetition becomes absolutely silly on page 199, when Dunn repeats the same quote twice on the same page in an oblivious manner.While repeating the primary characters' stories once per chapter might be helpful on an audio disc, or to someone reading a chapter and setting the book aside for a week before reading the next, as someone who churns through books I found it increasingly irritating. In particular, how many times do Elizabeth's and Mary's vastly different upbringings have to be compared before Dunn realizes that the reader gets it?However, I have to credit Dunn for creating a book that explores two fascinating Queens in a very even-handed and thorough manner."
5,The latest of a great biographer,"I have read Jane Dunn's books since she began with ""Moon in Eclipse,"" the story of Mary Shelley, the author of the tale of Frankenstein's monster and the lover of Percy Shelley, the English, tragic poet and friend of Lord Byron. She has grown as a biographer over these 30 years, from someone that dared not be public in her great talent to a mature writer who now has not only the courage to build a reputation for herself, but as someone who has taken a unique place in literature similar to Lyton Strachey, and with the potential of Virginia Wolf without the madness. This, her latest, rich volume will take its place in that tapestry that she sews - hopefully for many more adventures to come.I certainly would not have known of this extraordinary relationship between two monarchs without Jane's efforts and ability to paint a picture that comes alive again in her telling."
3,Too repetitious,"The authors over determination to create parralells in the womens lives create an unending series of repetitions. Not only are the sequences of events repeated, the conclusions she makes are also said at naseum. Any possible flow to the story is replaced by poorly adjoined references.A waste of reading time."
4,it's the end of the God as we know it,"If you think Salman Rushdie offended the Muslim community when he wrote ""The Satanic Verses"", just wait what the Christian, Jewish and (again) Muslim communities will say about this book. In just one chapter the author manages to remake (or rather re-tell) the 5000 year old story of monotheism and its peoples as a conspiracy against a conspiracy. And this is just ONE of the stories that make this novel offensive and interesting."
2,Disappointing,"This had the potential to be so much more than it was. To quote from the description, 'Over four hundred women fought disguised as men in the ranks of the American Civil War.'I'm sure there were many fascinating stories that could have been told. Unfortunately, the wrong story was chosen here. These 2 women were on a journey for much of the movie yet their story never really went anywhere. Their paths crossed but not enough effort was made to show a relationship developping between them, be it friendship or something more. The ending was particularly disappointing but by then I had lost interest in the characters anyway."
4,Welcome information and a good read.,"I am a recently retired scientist and finally have the time to do some things important to me such as science writing. So I looked for a source to guide and inspire me. The Field Guide is all I could have wanted.The editors have selected some of the best in the field to write and update the chapters. They begin each chapter with a helpful introduction to it's author. The Field Guide has excellent, timely, and useful information. It contains 'how to' chapters, 'where to look' and 'how to interview' chapters. Strunk and White would be impressed with the many examples of good writing.The Elements of Style, Fourth EditionIf you're a science writer, or want to be, you need the Field Guide as a reference and inspiration."
5,Essential reading,Doing science writing without reading this is like preaching in a Baptist church without having read the Bible.Buy it. Read it. Keep it at your elbow.
4,Great book ... wrong title.,"This book should have had a different title. It's not a second edition but a different book altogether. It's great but it's publication in no way changes the value of the original book, chapters from which, e.g. on writing from journals by Patrick Young and on using statistics by Victor Cohn (Yes I know that Lewis Cope has a chapter in the second book but the two are complementary rather than interchangeable) I still use in my science writing classes. The unfortunate result of this title is that the first book is virtually impossible to find now. Even just calling it ""The NEW field guide..."" or including the word Second or the year of publication would have sufficed. 'Twould have been more accurate - and I dare say more scientific - to do so. Should the editors or NASW ever do a third round, PLEASE give a new title or include the year/version in the title."
5,"Brilliant, informative, as objective as possible.",Guralnick treats us to yet another triumph. Previous books about Elvis (Goldman et al.) have not come close in trying to understand the legend for what he was and how he became what killed him.All biography should aspire to this.
5,THE definitive biography of Elvis Presley!,"Along with the author's ""Last Train to Memphis"", this is the definitive biography of Elvis Presley. To remember the vision, purpose and incredible drive that the young Elvis burst on the American musical scene with, and to see it be extinquished by personal insecurities, self-imposed exile from his public, and pharmaceuticals has to rank as one of the great cultural tragedies of the twentieth century."
5,Wow! What a book on the greatest musical artist of modern times,"I just finished reading this book and am amazed at the insights into Elvis' life that the author showed. He covered a lot of things that have been covered ad nauseum by others yet made it read like a novel. And, he adds so much more detail to the day-to-day life of Elvis that provide a much fuller description of his life. Even the footnotes are fascinating reading.For a true Elvis fan, this is a must have for your collection. I could hardly put it down and this is not trivial reading, given that the book is more than 700 pages. Mr. Guralinick's 1st book on Elvis (""Last Train to Memphis: the Rise of Elvis Presley"") is a must read also."
5,a great elvis story,A terrific story from beging to end...you sense you are there with the real elvis...a bit hard at first to get to grip with all the people in elvis's life but a well worth read...bring on the second book...
1,How much is fabrication?,"There is no doubt in my mind that Peter Guralnick is a skillful writer. There is likewise no doubt in my mind, after reading the paragraphs about Johnny Rivers and the song ""Memphis"" in his book, ""Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley"", that he is also an unethical writer. Either Guralnick did not investigate the motive of his sources prior to presenting the ""Memphis"" incident, or he was aware of the glaring inaccuracies and chose to write the misleading account anyway. Perhaps he was attempting to elicit sympathy for poor, trusting Elvis. This is an amusing paradox, as Guralnick seems to have little difficulty in exploiting the memory of Elvis for his own gain. I urge anyone who feels they must read this book, to take everything that is presented as truth with a grain of salt. I know the Johnny Rivers/Memphis accusation is a falsehood, how many other bits of fabrication are contained within this supposedly non-fiction work?"
2,Made my mother hate Elvis,I gave this book to my mother as a gift and she told me that it totally destroyed her love for Elvis. She gave it to my sister who had the same reaction. Thanks.
1,Careless Love: Fact or Fiction,We the readers are totaly at the mercy of the author. Is the story accurate? Are the facts correct? Only Elvis knows for sure.
1,me and no one else,"i read a good amount of books on musicans and artists and am excited to turn the page , both last train to memphis and carless love bored me stiff. I know i'm the only one who thinks this. Maybe elvis's life wasn't really that exciting , but i think it was and this book does not have exiting in it any where. I've read other books before that i didn't like , but it wasn't because it was boring , it just focused on one elment to long and seemed to be bias. I think i learned more about elvis in Led Zeplin book. These books from what i've read are supose to tell every thing there is about elvis. If this is true he was very dry and boring , i feel like i'm not reading a biography but a dry boring novel about some guy that happened to get famous. My over all Opinion is there are other and probably better books then these on Elvis."
2,Elvis Dead and Johnny Rivers doesn't look so good neither,"I really loved Last Train to Memphis and had been looking forward to this sequel for some time, but now I have mixed feelings. A major problem is that Elvis' life from 1958 to 1977 just isnt as interesting or dramatic as his initial rise to success. Mostly what we have here is a catalog of desultory and listless moviemaking, punctuated by an occasional recording session or concert that ignites the King's interest. To Guralnick's everlasting credit, he enjoys Elvis' music and its place in the American Pantheon, even when the music isn't all that good. This is the closest we have yet to an objective biography of Elvis Presley, but this half of the life did not merit an entire volume. And what is all this nonsense here on Amazon about Johnny Rivers? So what if he beat Elvis to the punch releasing Chuck Berry's Memphis? Does anyone whose last name is not Rivers really care anymore?"
2,"O.K but not definitive, or for everyone","I did not enjoy this book as much as other Elvis biographies that I have read. It is simply a hash of a number a biographies written over the years by the people surrounding him and hashed together by a writer -a good one at that, but at what -700 plus pages long it seemed to actually reveal less than some of the more personal, shorter and even judgemental books around. The Elvis biographies I personally liked best and would reccommend are ""Elvis and Gladys"" and ""Child Bride"" as well as Alanna Nash's book on the Colonel.. Strangely those were not included as the source for this book. Therefore I think it's wrong to call it definitive as has been in previous reviews. It's not bad but I don't think it's the best bio -even if others says so."
1,Depressing book,"I have read a lot of Elvis books, some good, some not. This one seemed determined to just show the bad side of the man. It is a thick book. By time I got done reading it, if I had not read other books, I would really think he was a bad person. I truly regret buying it. I tossed it in the trash when I was done.If you like Elvis, do not read this book."
3,Careless Journalism?,"I can't believe Peter's recklees journalism and misguided lack of fact.In particular the reference that Johnny Rivers stole the song Memphis from Elvis.How stupid of Peter.Peter not only didn't your do his homework on this subject,but instead seemed bent on repeating something somemebody says they heard somebody else say.This style of journalism Peter is second rate and distasteful and I thought benneth you.How could you ever look Johhny Rivers in the eye again? Respectfully sumitted, Gilbert Campagna"
4,Great iBook.,"I really enjoyed the book. After having visited Graceland it made so many of the things that I saw come to life. In so many ways it was a SAD life, but so is anyone's life if they don't truly have a relationship with our heavenly father!"
5,Great Guitar Pick!,This pick is great. Most medium gauge picks are now .73mm. This .71mm gauge pick is slightly thinner and makes it easier to strum and switch to single string picking with more ease for me than than the .73mm. The pick also has a slightly rougher feel to which allows you to grip it easier between the fingers.
3,Dunlop Gator Grip Pick Pack,"It is a good pick. Unfortunately, it did not improve my miserable playing.I will not be purchasing any more as Amazon fails to recognize the password I have used forever. I rate the pick much better than Amazon's sign in procedure."
3,"Fine, but not as described","The item arrived on time. The picks are not multi-colored, as advertised. They are all purple. They will still work fine, but they are for my little girl and she was really set on having different colors."
2,Not what I expected,This book was written in the UK. None of the terms or products are the same as the USA. Even the explanations of techniques are hard to understand because of all the english terms and slangs. I would not recommend this book because of this. 40.00 some dollars is a lot (too much)for this book and the knowledge it contains.
5,great!,"The book answered a lot of questions of terms. I wasn't familiar with many vocabulary of plastering like ""cornices"" or ""Darby"". I have been plastering for about 6 years and this book helped me better understand the craft and the tools. Plus I am not a big reader and I breezed through it!"
4,Their Skies Still Remain Clear,"There is just so much you can really say about U2. Nearly 30 years together, and they still haven't lost their luster as one of the most successful groups of all time. Their latest single continues to show how potent they are as a popular rock group. Window In The Skies, the second single from the groups' third greatest hits record U218 Singles is a upbeat and soulful song that captures them in delightful harmony. I like this song a whole lot, because there really isn't anything good on radio right now. I just hope that there is more new stuff coming up from U2 soon.Song: B 1/2+"
5,One of my favorite RPG's of all time.,"Love this game!!! Such a fantastic overlooked RPG. I got this game when it first came out and fell in love with it.PROS-Unique battle system-Engaging dark story-Great characters-Beautiful (I mean beautiful) soundtrack-Nice GraphicsCONS-Didn't know there were alternate endings until I was nearly finished with the game.-No strategy guide (for those who collect them, like me)-They made 2 crappy sequels to this lovely game... they do not do it justice."
4,"Oldie, but a goodie.","The Shadow Hearts series, unlike the Final Fantasy series, doesn't get very much recognition. There have been 3 SHs and they have only grown better with each one. SH 1 is the worst one out of trilogy, but it's not saying it's bad in any way. I figure the more games they release, the better they get (a special exemption to DMC, DMC 2 was horrific). This one follows out main protaginist Yuri on an adventure, he didnt even know he was going to embark on. Albert Smith is the main antagonist in the game, both being a ""Demon Shifter"", and after they meet...the fun begins!This is a definite buy, although, it can get pricy somtimes.Also try: Shadow Hearts 2 (If you've beat this one) or Shadow Hearts 3 (It's totally different)"
4,Old School RPG,A great RPG. It requires some skill but is not overly difficult. I enjoyed the whole series.
1,slow down!,"Upon purchasing, Shadow of Hearts I was extremely excited of the prospects of the game. A long time role playing gamer I relished a new opportunity. To my utter dismay I began my lame quest in Shadow of Hearts. Aesthetically well done this game still fell below the standard of eye candy. Pathetically, it still was its best quality. The game seems more like a slow sub-titled movie then anything else. The first half hour (the maximum amount one can tolerate prior to throwing in the litter box) was ladened with horrible dialog provided in written from The actual game play stuck to the theme of being very slow. I would hold off on this one. I will admit that I could not with stand the torture of the first half hour of game play and put the game to rest. Perhaps there is a diamond in this rough with more experimenting. Good Luck!"
1,Worst Game ever,"If I could give this game 5 negative Stars I would. This game is horrible and if someone actually liked it they need serious mental help. You don't control your character, basically you tell him what to do then sit and watch. The fights are a joke and the story is even worse. Do yourself a favor and keep away from this game unless you want to run it over with your car."
3,"Alright, Don't know why it needed a ""Mature"" rating","An RPG like Final Fantasy (wander, enter battles, manage points & items) except with much lower production values. The storyline and dialogue are uninspired. Also, I was hoping for some adult content b/c of the ""Mature"" rating but it never crossed, say, the Benny Hill Threshold."
4,A refreshing change,"I felt this was a nice change from your typical RPG. The story line, I felt was interesting and BGM was also nice. Although I felt more FMV could have been added to compliment the story, The game was pretty cool. I'd recommend it to anyone who want refreshing change of scenery from the typical Final Fantasy type of RPG."
5,AMAZING GAME,This game is amazing. Controls are easy. Battle system is easy. Love the Story. Goes deep into the story. Theres 2 different endings. Beat the game 2 times. Love both Ending. The play of it was just awesome. Great voice acting.Great Graphics for PS2. I still have this game. I play it for my PS3. Love everything about this. Characters were great.
4,Amazing Game Series,"I actually played SH Covenant first so I was super excited to get the back story. I had no idea Yuri was such a perv in the first game :o! However, I loved getting to know all of the characters. I like the game play but I am so glad they improved upon certain things for SH Covenant, like the discounts for shopping, the graphics (BIG improvement) and the ring customization. Overall, an awesome game to get you interested in an awesome group of characters!"
4,good instructions,This book gives good step by step instructions on how to make bows. This is the original version. The book has been updated since.
2,The color is not Olive Green. Nothing like the picture too!!,I got Pashmina Olive Green Shawl as a gift. The color is not even close to Olive Green or the color on the picture! Way off! It's bright medium green. Made in China. No fabric content - just 100% pashmina. Item description is an example of false advertising. It stated in there that it's cashmere?!! It's not a wool - synthetics. I requested to return this shawl. Will update on the outcome.
5,Thrash at it's finest,"Truly a genre-defining classic, ""Bonded By Blood"" IS thrash metal. Featuring the late, great Paul Baloff on vocals, this album shreds away with intense, yet catchy, music. Lots of memorable, shout-along choruses, as well as plenty of neck-breaking riffs! Featuring total thrash classics, sure to get the mosh pit started, such as ""Strike of the Beast"", ""Metal Command"", ""A Lesson in Violence"", and, of course, the legendary title track. Paul's raw vocals serve as the perfect compliment to the band's down and dirty thrash style, which has been imitated countless times. If you plan to get into thrash metal, this should be one of the first albums on your wish list!"
5,Exodus Bonded,"I had this album on cassette when it first came out. Loved it. Well, that was more than 20 years ago. I heard them on xm radio, so I decided to buy it on cd. It was pretty much like I remembered. Awesome. Glad I bought it."
5,This is the most quintessential thrash album of all time.,"Exodus invented thrash metal with this album. At the time this was heavier than anything previous. It made Metallica, Anthrax and even Slayer seem weak. Lesson in Violence is a true metal classic. I have purchased this album in various forms (record, tape, CD) at least 10 times since it came out in the early eighties and everytime I lend it to someone, they steal it because it is great. So I am now buying it again. I concur that it is too bad it no longer has the original cover."
3,Let's be real here...,"This album came out in 1985 I think. As a debut album (and considering the state of Thrash at the time) it's pretty good--but not great. It's faster and heavier than ""Kill 'em All"" and definitely better than ""Killing's My Business..."" but, ""Kill 'em All"" had better songs. BbB pales in comparison to other Thrash albums released about the same time; ""Spreading the Disease"" (Anthrax), ""Peace Sells...But Who's Buying"" (Megadeth), ""Ride the Lightning"" (Metallica), and ""Master of Puppets"" (Metallica) all kick the crap out of this album. The biggest weaknesses of BoB are (1) the vocals are annoying, and (2) the riffs are rather average. The riff is the heart of any metal song. Dull riffs = dull album.Not terrible (if you like 80's Thrash) but not recommended."
1,metalhead,"never liked exodus, vocals have always been terrible sounds like screamy more than singing. if you want real metal listen to slayer, megadeth, metal church, death angel, and metallica."
3,I think you are forgetting something...,"Kirk of Metallica was a guitarist for this band, they did some damage in their time. I'm not sure who the guitar players the other guy listed were."
5,Best Exodus Album,"This has to be the best Exodus album ever made. Don't get me wrong the others are as well, but with the raw sound and energy they produced with Baloff on vocals putting his effort on the title track, No Love, Deliver Us To Evil, And Then There Were None, and Exodus he expressed a technique that was the epitomy of the Exodus thrash saga. Didn't care too much for Souza's examples of And Then There Were None, and A Lesson In Violence. Don't get me wrong he's a great singer, but the original stands out best with Baloff. Exodus to this day is one of the best Bay Area thrash outfits of thier time and still produces the best on the West Coast. I defitenately recommend this album to any first time Exodus listeners before buying ""Tempo Of The Damned"" so you get a feel of what old Exodus was like with Baloff on Lead. Enjoy this album and play it loud like it was meant to be. Cheers!!!"
5,Thanks for the violence!,"Let me just say that this album rocks! This is pure no-frills thrash with incredibly funny lyrics. Since this album came out in the mid-80s, there are numerous references to Satan, looting and pillaging, and, of course, legions and other medieval references. That is definitely the charm of this album and basically 80s metal. No suits or lawyers were involved in the metal scene at the time and the result is no holds barred thrash that kicks ...!"
5,Another superb CD from this incredibly talented songstress.,"Brenda Russell is an artist who seems to get better with each new CD she releases--as good as ""Paris Rain"" was, this is even better!!! Her velvet-smooth, heartwarming, evocative and at times wistful vocals are nothing short of heavenly. Her songwriting skills and lyrical vision are matched by very few of her contemporaries. If you like REAL R&B with nice touches of Jazz then this CD is more than guaranteed to please. The fact that the mainstream has almost always ignored this great singer/songwriter is appalling."
3,She's Too Cool For The Room,"I am very picky about my R&B now that HIP HOP is now so saturated in our society. Artists/songwriters like Brenda Russell are in the shadows of this new synthetic sound forced over the air waves. Man am I impressed with this CD! I knew that she could write beautifule lyrics, but I had no idea that Brenda Russell could sing jazz and scat the way she did on the album title song ""Between The Sun and The Moon. Why is she not exploiting this talent. Her next album should be a latin jazz set. Brenda Russell, thank you for being true to real R&B. The music that will perpetuate all of the gimmicks currently out there. Although its not a completely acoustic sounding album, she stays true to her style and authentic R&B. This is a must buy. Keep groovin."
4,So Cool,"LOVE BRENDA RUSSELL! Love this CD. Especially the track ""The Message"" WHICH IS ON REPEAT ETERNALLY! LOVE IT!"
1,"I love Brenda's work, but this CD was disappointing","I think nothing will top ""Two Eyes"". Every song on that album is a gem. I never get tired of it, and I started with the album and replaced it later in CD format. I also love ""Get Here"". I haven't followed her music for quite a while and was so pleased to come across this disc today. Then I sat down and listened to it and was so let down. If you classify it R&B;, then it blows away most of the garbage on the radio, today. As a jazz disc it is fair, certainly more melodic than most. However, since she really is best at writing masterfully crafted pop, this album does not stand up to the quality of her previous work. Even her vocals don't have the smile and power and sheer joy of singing from those other two albums.I would not recommend this one if you're a fan of Brenda's, because you'll be very disappointed that you wasted your money. I know I sure am."
3,"Some Highlights, Some filler","Highlights are ""Make You Smile, It's A Jazz Day, her cover of""The Tracks of My Tears"" and ""Between The Moon And The Stars""with a very nice vocal from Patti Austin. However, many of theother selections sound similar and not really interesting musically or lyrically."
4,Magnificent!,"Upon hearing this diva's previous offering, ""Paris Rain"", I knew we were in for future treats. Well one of those magnificent treats has arrived. ""Between The Sun And The Moon"" is simply a joy. African nuances both musically and vocally can be found throughout. The music is solid and the vocals are right on point. Highlights include the infectious ""You Know Our Day Will Come"", ""Too Cool For The Room"", and the thought-provoking ""Let Somebody Know"". I can honestly say, I like all the songs on the CD except for two. Ten songs out of twelve aint bad. In a word, MAGNIFICENT!!!"
4,Soulish & Jazzy,"This is the brandnew Brenda Russel album and has its very own flavour. It is very jazzy and soulish - something to relax or to drink cocktails to :) More experimental than her big hits. It's good for soul-lovers but might be disappointing to people who liked her from her ""Kiss me with the wind""-area"
3,A long overdue compilation,"This is a very good 3 cd box set of Saxon's first ten years worth of singles (every single up to 1988). All the tracks are remastered and sound great . It is available at a very reasonable price , in most cases under $30.00 . It is full of all Saxon's classic singles and b sides . Still with all of their singles contained here it is still missing some great Saxon songs , but for the price you still get your monie's worth. I do hope they release another one covering the years after 1988 ."
2,3 CDs ?,"This three cd set does cover 20 years of Saxon. But except for the classics from the first 5 Saxon cds""LPs"" this item is full of fluff. Great songs include, Dallas 1 pm, Denim & leather, Power and the glory, wheels of steel, and Crusader to name a few. There are also live versions of some of the classics. The biggest problem I have is the drums sound very hollow. I know Saxon never had great production, but I think the analog to digital transfer could have been done much better. One more thing, just like all greatest hits collections they always leave one or two ""GREAT"" songs of the list, in this case it is The Eagle has landed, one of Saxons greatest songs."
4,Saxon Rocks!,"This is a great compilation to get ya some old Saxon. However, you might as well order Strong Arm of the Law and Denim & Leather, too, if you want to get some of the missing beloved anthems that Saxon is known for."
3,Not what I thought,"I bought these suspenders thinking they would be more comfortable than the nylon 2"" elastic type design I had before. I was right, they were more comfortable, but not what I thought they would be. I thought that they would distribute the weight across my shoulders, and I also thought the shoulder straps would be more padded than they were. But on a positive note, they are a well designed suspender. I connected them directly to my belt. I also like the front detatchable chest strap to keep the shoulder straps in place while working. Overall, they are a step up from the 2"" nylon, but I've seen better."
3,"Good films, good transfers. Pricey at $26.99",SIX GOOD VINTAGE BRITISH FILMS. TRANSFER QUALITY IT GOOD. MANY OF THESE ARE AVAILABLE IN OTHER SETS. A BIT PRICEY AT $26.99 FOR 6 PUBLIC DOMAIN FILMS.
1,Low-Quality Transfers,"The quality of the picture and sound in ""British Cinema Classic B Film Collection, Vol. 1"" is mediocre. The picture is generally blurry, the sound fuzzy. Most of the films carry the logo of a TV distributor. One of them, ""The Siege of Sidney Street,"" was filmed in a widescreen process called Dyaliscope (2.35:1), but on this disc the picture is cropped to the old TV ratio (1.33:1). The right and left sides are cut off."
4,Superior text which awakens age-old tradition!,"This book is excellent. As others suggest that the dead may be found in similar condition, it ought be mentioned that these saints' bodies had no preservatives and in some cases, should have decomposed even more quickly based on where they were buried. The book is loaded with information and great pictures. This whole process of exhuming a body and placing it in a crystal coffin has been in place for years in Europe....only Americans would find this gross. Mrs. Cruz is commended for thorough research and the photographs. I use the book so often in my research that I have gone through several copies and recently had most last edition hard bounded. Highly recommend this and her many other books. It must be something in that New Orleans air!"
5,Good book,"Love the book Eucahristic Miracles. This one is a bit morbid as some horrible things were done to these Saints and Incorruptibles. Can only read a couple of the stories at a time. Amazing miracles. Nice that it's not a book to read front to back, just pick up and read a couple ""stories"", all of which are true and investigated"
5,great gift,"I have had a copy of this book for years, but have begun purchasing them for my friends who are either unfamiliar with this phenomenon, or are seeking info about the Catholic Church. I find everyone is fascinatd with the topic, and this is the best book on the subject."
5,The Incorruptibles,Book was in excellant condition and arrived on time. The book is very interesting.
3,Classic that needs an update,"Great, fascinating book that I found very compelling and uplifting. However this classic needs some updating. 1) What about current incorruptibles like Padre Pio? The book would be better if it included modern day saints. 2)Whenver possible, show photos. That is the most compelling argument for the incorruptibles. There are many incorrupt saints whose bodies are on display around the world, but their pictures were not included in this book. To be complete, they should be. 3) Photos show the miracle better when they are close up, not at a distance showing the whole reliquary. 4) When photos are not available, use artword depicting the miracle. e.g. the sculpture that was created dipicting St. Cecilia's incorrupt body. To sum up: great book that just needs a facelift. (Pardon the pun.)"
4,The Incoruptibles,"As a Catholic, I found this book very interesting. Reading it also renewed my faith. It shows that there really are saints and miracles. This book proves the existance of spiritual occurances."
5,Amazing!,This book is amazing! What a pleasure to learn about the incorruptibles. Will help build your faith.God Bless!
5,Great for Those Wanting to Learn Proven Options Strategies,"I learned about the futures and options market in my MBA classes. However, you don't learn street proven trading strategies from an MBA program. You learn these strategies from books such as Optional Wealth.This book is great for those looking to learn proven options strategies for the first time. For those who are already experienced options traders, there are techniques in the book that can enhance your current trading strategies.The author's publish their trandes on their website and you'll notice that they rarely lose."
5,best kept secret,I could not of found a better book to help me get started in trading options. The concept is made simple. The text and examples are easy to understand. A big bonus with this book is finding they have an Email service you can subscribe to that takes a lot of the guess work out of trading. Who has all day to do research when these guys have a proven track record of sucess? I would highly recommend this book to whoever is interested in improving their financial future.
5,Works great!,"This has been a very good hedge trimmer....We decided that rather than keep burning out cheap onesa, it was worth the extra money for a commercial grade. It has been a good decision."
2,It passed the time.,"I didn't actually realise that this book was the third in a series. Now that I have read other readers reviews, I am relived to know that I have a more interesting read ahead of me with The Forever King. Life is too short to read a really boring book, or drink bad wine. I finished this book so it couldn't have that boring. The author did portray the knights as complete heathens, I suppose it must been hard to fit in when you have been thrust into a different century altogether. I liked the modern day take on Arthur but wouldn't recommend it unless it was the only book on the shelf."
2,Please find another writing partner,"I would have to agree with the other reviews entirely, disjointed characters dropping into the nether land only to be glimpsed as a spirit out of the corner of your eye. I got the impression this was written in haste and it shows, (let's just get the third one out and be done!) the author owes her fans (now previous) more than this. I actually thought there must be a 4th book coming out as the characters just flat disintegrated, what a way to end what started as a good inovative new look at the age old problem of might vs right. Both the editor and author should be ashamed (actually I would fire the editor) to put this chaos into publication, at least put out a 4th book to clean up the mess."
4,Hard to accept- but worth the effort.,"I really enjoyed the first books, THE FOREVER KING and THE BROKEN SWORD, but this one was very hard for me to read. Not that it was a difficult read, but because you know that the choices made by the characters will ultimately lead to great pain. The cold blooded violence was disturbing. The sacrifice and deep love that were woven throughout the story were sometimes heart wrenching. Arthur is maturing in this life as well as ""thru the ages"". With maturity comes great change and it is very difficult to accept. Especially for the readers who loved the boy Arthur was in the previous novels.Any writer who makes you feel such complex emotions, that you fear finishing a book, has done a good job. You cry for the Arthur you loved, but you celebrate the ending as a new beginning for all."
3,I actually liked some of it but...,"like everyone's been saying, there were a lot of inconsistancies, and i wish they had had more on other characters from previous books, such as beatrice, and less of just the hal and emily thing. she didnt really mention anything of them at all. also, towards the end it just got, blah. the last few chapters just seemed so bad."
1,Pathetic,"I really enjoyed the first two books in this series, ""The Forever King"" and ""The Broken Sword"". I was looking forward to reading this book, but what a disappoimtment. Ms Cochran doesn't even remember the plot elements of her earlier books or ignores them."
5,A must buy for AC/DC fans!,"I bought this book and cd from Amazon.com because I always wanted to play AC/DC songs on the guitar. The book has both tabulature and standard notation for you to read so you can play. The book explains how to read them and other symbols used in the music. Tabulature is very easy to understand, but if the book does not explain it well enough for you, go to www.olga.net for more information on how to read tab. The book also has the lyrics to all the songs. The CD has each song in the book with out lyrics, and then has the songs again but without the lead guitar so you can play as the lead guitarist. I suggest that anyone that has a guitar and is an AC/DC fan should get this book and CD."
3,QC problem,My only complain is that the track 1 and 7 are the same (Back in Black). The 7 should have the lead guitar removed. It seems a QC problem.But the sund quality is ok and the tabs are Ok.
4,Good Tablature Book if Anything,"The concept of this product is great but, it doesnt live up to the hype. There is supposed to be no lead guitar on the background tracks yet a lead is audible on many of the tracks. I can just use an AC/DC CD for that. It is fun to play with but, not what I thought it would be. If you can get it used for under $10 bucks, go for it."
3,THE FORECAST IS HEATING UP!,"This is an odd story about the most peculiar woman to ever grace a manga page. Keiko is the weather woman for a floundering Japanese TV station, but she soon hits upon a formula that sends the ratings through the roof...she lifts her skirt and flashes her panties!Now that takes talent!The real quirkiness sets in about halfway through the story, as Keiko's manipulationns of the people at the station begin to backfire, and she is soon caught in an ever-tightening web of her own making.This manga version isn't as light-hearted as the movie version. However, the strange characters and surreal setting of Japanese TV stations are certain to keep your interest."
2,Not usable,"You would need to do some serious machining to get this to work. the hole is not large enough to get the sight aperature adjusted for windage. For elevation, it works fine but the AK cleaning kit already has an elevation adjustment tool. Would not recommend."
2,Windage & Elevation Tool,I used this product on my Yugo SKS. Work for my elevation but not for windage. Used it on a Norinco SKS same problem.
4,"Reprint of ""lost"" 1914 feminist fantasy adventure novel","This edition is a reprint of an exquisite 1914 feminist fantasy adventure novel, which went out of print without fanfare and then was ""rediscovered."" It is an allegory about women's freedom and the restraint imposed by heterosexual pair-bonding.A group of five men are shipwrecked on an uncharted island where they meet five shy but dazzling winged women. While they hammer and build and pass the time Robinson-Crusoe style, the women silently flutter in and out of their days, teasing them with unattainable femininity.The men devise plans to capture and woo the angel-like women, using ""bait"" such as mirrors and scarves. Finally they succeed, and in a terrible scene, cut the wings from each woman, forcing them to walk from henceforward.Lots of dialogue about male-female relationships as the pairing off ensues. The men hold a variety of viewpoints about the proper way to treat women. A final surprise arrives with the new generation. Wings!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This item was shipped taken off a shelf and a USPS label was slapped on the back. No box, cover etc. Arrived torn and bent. Cost me almost $5.00 to have it shipped to me in that condition and now I have to pay return postage to mail it back! Putting it in the garbage and calling it a lesson learned. Very Disappointed!"
2,Flimsy Desk Pad,Arrived pretty bent up and dog-eared. Poorly packaged and probably handled roughly in delivery. Not the quality that I paid for. Go to Office Depot; better deal by far.
1,Shallow.,"This book is sadly lacking in content. All of one sentence is devoted to explaining why Reagan ran the national debt up during his administration ""He didn't think it was important."" Not important to a conservative Republican? Really? To credit Reagan with the downfall of communism in the USSR is like crediting the US for the downfall of apartheid in South Africa. I think that the people of South Africa had something to do with that as did the people in the USSR. Too much of this book is dwells on Reagan's physical attributes: ""Even Reagan's personal physicians commented on the clarity of his spit."" In a six hundred page book I don't think that more than forty pages go by without some kind of reference to his ""glossy black hair."" The book does not contain one mention of minority relations or civil rights. Why? It's a shallow book about a shallow man."
1,Not A Real Biography,"I was very dissappointed with this book. It is written as a fictional novel with the Reagan biography weaved into the story. I read about a third of the book before I put it aside. I would wait for a real historical biography. Otherwise, you will spend too much time seperating the fictional novel from the real historical facts (if you can)."
1,Reagan deserves better than this.,"It is a shame all those years with Reagan produced this weak ""memoir"". It emphasizes the trivial, as a gossip columnist would, a weak attempt to be entertaining rather than scholorly. If you want to read a good bood on Reagan, read Dinesh D'Souza's ""Ronald Reagan""."
1,"Pretentious, bizarre and incompetent","Others have written revealing and insightful accounts ofRonald Reagan. This is just pretentious ego-trippery, rubbish and fiction masquerading as biography. It is a complete waste of time, and hard to review as it is virtually beneath reviewing. There is one particularly weird segment where the author castigates Ronald Reagan for going to Berlin and saying ""Mr Gorbachov, tear down this wall!"" instead of quoting Robert Frost's poetry about walls and thereby showing himself an intellectual! Like, it's a sign of stupidity to be moral and forthright - and right??? I can only agree with the previoous reviewer that the publishers deserve to lose a fortune."
3,Dutch by Proxy,"This author wrote an excellent biography about Ted Roosevelt. Too bad he choose this time to engage in ""scribel self gratification"" He fails to cover the real RR or to amplfy his true value to the US and the world. That said ,the book is worth while reading in that it does tell a lot about the personal side of Reagan albeit in a style however more suitable to a tabloid.I had the feeling after I read this Memoir that the author had not done a very good research job on his subject and was up against a contract deadline of some sort and had to throw it together quickly to get it out to the public while he concentrated his energy on his next volume about TR. Surprisingly I think the author likes RR but in some weird way he has a need to cut him down to size.Too bad also about his cheap shots at Nancy and Jane Wyman--not at all worthy of a Pulitzer Prize winner"
1,A Man Who Likes the Sound of His Own Voice,"I was challenged by a friend of mine, that if I really appreciated Ronald Reagan, I would have to prove it by wading through what is arguably the worst book on Reagan. I have to say that he was right. I am about half-way through, and I doubt that I'll be able to finish. It's like being cornered by the most boring person at a party, who likes the sound of his own voice--regardless of whether he is saying anything interesting or not. The way that he has hijacked a biography on Reagan, and placed his own history like a leach on the primary story, leaves me gasping for air. This is only surpassed by his repetitive and abusive use of foreign clichés, as if he was looking down his nose at the poor, illiterate peasant who has scraped together enough money to pay homage to Lord Morris by purchasing his magnificent tome. Save your money, and read a good biography on Reagan instead. Even for free, it's not worth the price."
2,"A memoir of Edmund Morris--err, I mean Ronald Reagan","There once was a writer named MorrisDid he write on Ron Reagan tobore us?For there's too much of himwhich made many feel grimas many reviewers did chorus______Although I am no fan of Ronald Reagan's politics, I must admit that he was a better person than I had thought; the book did give me that much, but as my limerick goes, there was far too much of the fictionalized Morris in it-- was he trying to fill up space or was it ego or a somewhat of both?"
1,Very disappointing,"As a political professional and observer of the electoral process, I purchased this book with great anticipation. I was sorely disappointed. The space dedicated to Morris' own fictional character seems to eclipse that spent on Reagan himself and is -- as a figment of the writer's imagination -- useless in a biography. In fact, these passages render the book essentially unreadable, in my opinion. It is tragic that the one man granted complete access to this pivotal historic figure wasted so much of his time -- and that of the reader -- on a work which is, more often than not, fictional."
1,Don't waste your time or your money on this book,"I looked forward to reading this book. As I began I was at first impressed by the author's study of his subject and expected a fair accounting of the good and the not so good. I finally had to quit reading on page 367, I just couldn't stand it any longer. I completely agree with previous reviewers of this book who describe the author's smug, arrogant, elitist, self-important writing style. The author's use of nonexistent characters to utter unqualified remarks about Reagan indicated to me that the author is not to be trusted. There was more about the author's imaginary friends than there was about Reagan. I hate ""revisionist history"" and this book is the ultimate in history abuse. How this book got to be an ""authorized"" biography would probably be an interesting story in itself. I feel cheated that I spent good money on this book."
1,A Wasted and Pathetic Attempt To Write A Biography,"This has to be the most pathetic presidential biography ever attempted. Edmund Morris was given nearly unlimited access to Mr. Reagan and instead of writing an accurate biography, he chose to write a ""story"" that continually talks about himself, invents people and conversations, and tells us how he felt about Mr. Reagan. Hopefully Mr. Morris will give up all of his notes so that he might at least assist someone else who will write a true and accurate biography of President Reagan."
3,Nice Story but,"An enjoyable read despite the liberties the author took by fictionalizing the narrator. I had hoped to learn more about RR's rise to prominence in the Republican Party in more detail than Mr. Morris presented. I could have learned the same from watching various tele-pundits and reading screeds to RR on the editorial pages of the major periodicals.While I enjoyed the 672 page book, I will, unfortunately, remember it more as a piece of fiction (especially the ""surprise"" ending) than as an enduring historical reference.(The lack of detail in this review is my sincerest form of flattery for the author.)"
3,Dutch,"Although I admire Ronald Reagan for his work as our President, I was drawn to this book by the controversy that surrounded its literary technique. After reading the book, I did not find the technique confusing or offensive. Morris's tool for telling the early Reagan years was actually very effective. My problem with the book lay in the portrayal of Reagan in his latter years. Although Morris points out many of Reagan's accomplishments, he tends to convey Reagan, as opposed to what Morris himself says, as an airhead."
2,Not the definitive biography Morris was hired to write,"I don't have very much to add to what has already been written. However, what I was most disappointed by was the little new information about Reagan's presidency that was developed. Though the book has much to say about Reagan as a person, Morris adds virtually nothing to the historical record regarding the Reagan presidency or any other aspect of his political career, despite the access he was given. In short, a fairly well-written book that is not really worth the time or money."
3,Dutch: The Memoirs of Ronald Reagan,"I found this book a difficult read. However I did enjoy it. It seemed to me that Mr Morris wrote this for PHD's and Political Science majors. I haven't had to use a dictionary in a long time, but did with this one. All in all it was well written, just could have been easier."
4,Brilliant... yet ill-conceived,"It's all so simple, ""Dutch"" is basically written as a movie. It reminded me of Citizen Kane (who was J.F. Kane?... what's this Rosebud all about?...) Morris is obviously a talented writer who unfortunately undercut himself with his fictional creations (self-inflicted wounds... always the most painful). Too bad. Passages of this book are brilliant. All in all not a bad look into the amazing life of our 40th president."
5,"very favorable, this is a fascinating and honest book","This is a mesmerizing book, and the reader will soon see that Mr. Morris has been scrupulous about revealing his research process. Many biographers use the conventional biographic technique to tell the reader what is essentially their personal version of the life. While Morris's daring method may not be entirely successful, it does not interfere with or distort what he has observed or been able to learn about Reagan. His brilliant writing and unusual method give you a sense that you are learning more about Reagan than you would in the typical ""he did this, then he did that, that after that he did that, too"" biography. Dutch is subtitled A Memoir. It is a portrait, and a fascinating one."
5,"Fascinating approach, captures the Man.","This unusual approach to biography takes some effort on the part of the reader, but ultimately is worth it. The author should be congratulated for breaking out of the traditional biographical mold. Ronald Reagan comes to life in these pages, which don't gloss over his shortcomings but also don't understate his achievements and his unusual personal story. Hard to put down once you get into it!"
1,just horrid,"Mr. Morris is great writter but this book is unreadable. One can not understand the frist chapter of this work and it gets worse from there. There is one chapter the Bittberg/ Bergan Belisen trip that it insightful. However this is more then counter balanced by the 100 or so pages of incoherant nothingness. Morris if in search of a way to tell the story could have used a frist person approach like robert graves in I Cludius, or mybe non liner structure like Stanly Donan movie ""two for the road."" Insteed we get a fly on the wall point of view, which would ok but the fly has a son, and we also get a son of the fly on the wall view of Reagan."
2,"So disappointing! It's a novel, not a biography.","I was intrigued when I read about Morris' unconventional approach, and looked forward to the book. But once I got into it, ""Dutch"" made me angry. It's not biography. It's a fictional tale about an extremely self-centered writer, with Ronald Reagan kind of flickering around in the background. The most self-indulgent and infuriating part of the book is when Morris spends two pages telling us how successful his Roosevelt biography was in 1980 -- but only offers half a page on the fascinating presidential election that year. Morris is much more interested in himself than in Reagan or U.S. history.I'm almost tempted to ask for my money back."
2,"I finally have to agree, a great disappointment.","Unlike many people, I waited until I read the last word of thisbook to make my judgment.Mr. Morris is a beautiful writer--he verymuch has a gift with a pen. The material is very much there, but he essentially failed to present it as it needed to be. If only the rest of the book were as good as the prologue.Readers would be better advised to search on Amazon's out-of-print search for President Reagan's autobiography, ""An American Life"" or, better yet, Lou Cannon's books about Reagan. As for this one, wait until it hits the remainder bins.I hope Mr. Morris can redeem himself with the second volume of his life of Theodore Roosevelt."
1,This book is a joke,"After reading the biography on Theodore Rossevelt, I was excited about getting this book. However, the book left me with an ill feeling. How can Morris put a fictional character in the book to tell a life story? It makes no sense for a respected author to do this. The fictional accounts take time away from what the author should have been talking about in the first place. I'm sure no sane author would have done anything close to this travesty..."
1,Reagan deserved better than this,"After hearing Edmund Morris elegance on TV as he promoted his book, I could not wait to read it. I expected great biography, what I got was a hodgepodge of fiction, biography, and Morris endless drivel about his childhood. I never knew where history stopped and fiction began.I would tell myself over and over again: Surely, this book is going to get better. It was a vain wish. After reading only 200 of the nearly 700 pages, I put it down, never to pick it up again. Ronald Reagan deserved better than this."
4,focusing on early memories,"I read the only the first two chapters. I am a NYS Psychologist who specializes in dealing with and interpreting early memories. Mr. Morris delineates many of the President's screen memories. From what I have been told, the author sees Mr. Reagan's psychological matrix as being one of being a ""rescuer"".My analysis reveals a much more complicated personality: Mr. Reagon appears to have a psychological matrix of being threatened with death, then being confined, and then saying 'I'm out of here.' This last division of his psychological blueprint seems most important. For the last twenty years or so, he has become more and more senile... which in my opinion is an example of his being 'out of here.'The book is extremely well-written and riveting. The only downside, is that at times, the author confuses his life with the President's life."
1,Where's the Rest of Him?,"Edmund Morris's biography about the president who least resembled an IBM Selectric II typewriter (he lacked both a memory and a colon) is a bit of fantasy all by itself.Reagan, who greatly damaged our country with his absurd deficits, his Hollywood-war ""Star Wars,"" and his numerous scandals (who can forget everything from James Watt's rape of the environment to HUD?) now gets the cheesecloth treatment in this ""elegie.""Morris could do a ""Madlibs"" with this book, and create a glowing bio of North Korean Dictator Kim Il Sung. It might even make a better read."
1,Self Serving at best,"Mr. Morris robed $3 million and also the American people who deserved much, much more of President Regan's life and times. Presidential memoirs are to be held in a certain reverence as a bookmark to history. Mr Morris has shattered that belief and leaves the reader trying to swim through what is fact, history and fiction. Inserting himself into one of the most anticipated biographies this century will forever brand him as a selfserving, self-important hack. He himself justifies this title by having to defend his methods on the talk show circuit and in the begining of the book. It's pure trash and a dis-service to the reader and to the Regan family."
2,Historical revisionism,I can not comprehend why the author decided to introduce fictional characters into his biography. This technique is inapproperiate and deplorable. You would be much better off skipping this book entirely.
1,"A ""work"" a real piece of work. . .","When everybody knows (and Morris has stated on C-Span and in other interviews) that Morris has ""filled in"" first person reportage created from whole cloth about a profoundly ill subject who could not recall ANY aspect of the ""first person"" that Morris so blithely slathers across the page. . .Morris has no excuses. He has no subject. He has no facts. He has no interviews with the subject. He has no shame. He HAS money from the thinnest excuse for biography since the average 3rd grade book report.Well, fiction is too kind a term."
1,a piece of garbage,Having read and admired the Morris book on TR I was looking forward to his book on Reagan. I was very disappointed. When I start a book I finish it with very very few exceptions. After torturing myself with the first 200 pages of this book I tossed it aside-just couldn't see wasting any more time on it. Morris had Reagan's life in front of him-I don't see why he had to put himself in the book as a fictional character. If you are going to read this book- don't buy it-rent it from a library. That way you won't feel ripped off.
1,"Just pertinent parts,as when he was shot are worth reading","This is a book that seeks to destroy President Reagan's legacy. Reagan boring??? I dont think so. I go with the authors wife's comment, ""well be certainly bored a lot of people to vote for him. This mainly is trash. It's certainly not an objective look at what President was, meant or said. I just wish I could give it half a star!"
2,Petty Hackjob,"I can't figure out if Mr. Morris is clueless or simply envious of Ronald Reagan. From the beginning, the author never really gives the president his due, but instead credits Reagan with only incredible luck. It isn't until P.335 that he finally reveals the source of his animosity, ( his son belonged to the radical 60's weatherman faction of the S.D.S. and went ""underground"".) This the author blames on the policies of then Governor Reagan. It's quite obvious that Mr. Morris feels himself intellectually superior not only to Reagan, but to most Americans as well. He and his elitist friends are completely perplexed by the popularity Reagan enjoyed. Some decent tibits here & there, but if you're looking for the true picture of Ronald Reagan, look elsewhere."
1,Dutch: A Disappointment,"Edmund Morris is a first class writes and historian. Given the access he had to primary materials this book is a disappointment. Personally I think it was Ghostwritten by someone much less talented - maybe one of Reagan's speech writers. Whoever wrote it, Morris needs to hire someone else."
2,Bizarre!,"Bizarre is the best word I can think of to describe my opinion of this book. And the only reason I give it two stars instead of one is that I believe Morris did try here. Most opinions that he failed, however, to understand Reagan are visibly correct. I say bizarre not only because of the fictional twist but because of the strange flow of this biography. The best example I have is found in chapter two when he switches from fiction to Reagan's visit to his birthplace (with Morris) and then goes into facts such as time, date, situation etc. and points out for ""the second of his wives (Nancy)"" the zodiac stats. I tried to get into this book but feel that the effort to sort it out won't produce any further understanding of one of our most significant presidents."
1,Boring as hell!,"Edmund Morris, author is undoubtedly a windbag if this book is any indication. Actually he does say a few nice things about President Reagan when he is not saying something about himself. I find nothing redeeming about this fat book!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!,"Deserves less than one star but one star is the lowest rating I can give. Return this book if you have purchased it.This book is more about Morris than Reagan. Morris, for all he obvious intellect, cannot figure out how Ronald Reagan could accomplish so much without being an intellectual.I gave the reviews and write-ups the benefit of the doubt however after force reading 65 pages of Morris' drivel, I am returning the book."
1,Morris is a self absorbed cynic,Edmund Morris confuses cynicism with sophistication. He constantly offers the reader snide commentary on RR that has no value whatsoever beyond gossip.The author is too self absorbed to be a biographer.The margins of my copy of Dutch are full of notes I wrote expressing my frustration at this idiot of an author.I will never read anything he has written again and I recommend to others that they save their time by doing the same.
1,In My Trashcan,"This book is awful. What a disappointment after such great success with Theodore Roosevelt. I forced myself through half this book straining to distinguish reality from the fiction and fantasy that Morris interjects willy-nilly throughout. What a chore, what a bore, what a waste. This went in the trash can rather then the bookshelf to insure no one else might pick it up and waste as much time as I did on it."
2,Hype Masking Confusion,"To read this book is agony. The interjections of the ""fictional author"" generally annoy and never enlighten.How could a biographer spend so much time with his subject and his closest associates, with access to both his official papers and his most intimate diaries, and so fail to understand him?Perhaps Mr. Reagan is not the only one suffering mental deficits."
3,Pulitzer prize winning fiction?,"The book read like Pulitzer prize winning fiction. Ambiguous and jumpy with poor communication skills yet still impressive. It is not a biography - it is something new and kind of scary. Edmund Morris proves that he is a remarkable wordsmith but is that all that it takes to be a great writer?You may want to read a chapter or two before you buy the book. If you like traditional biographies and not literature you may not like this hodge-podge of creative remembrances.Reagan lovers beware. This books is not flattering of THE PRESIDENT. The book seems designed to humiliate Dutch. Morris is very flattering of Dutch in his interviews which can mislead book buyers of his intentions. This is obviously a book written by someone who does not understand the American psychology, culture, etc... Still - with all that said. If you love Ronnie you will find some of his more endearing traits gleaming in spots throughout the book."
3,"A fascinating, unusual book","Despite all the harsh criticism given this book, I found it a very illuminating portrait of Reagan. The fictional characters, though odd in a biography, didn't bother me. Beautifully written, hard to put down."
1,Not such a great book...,"...and the problem isn't the ""fictionalized"" character. The problem is that it doesn't paint Reagan in the proper light. As one of the most frightening, dim-witted, puppet presidents in United States history. With more staff and cabinet indictments than even the Clinton administration--it's important to remember that the damage Reagan did to the country won't go away by dry cleaning it. Check out the books ""Firewall"" by Lawrence Walsh and ""The Last Mogul"" by Dennis McDougal if you want to read the REAL story of the most decietful, bumbling president in our generation."
1,This is an incredibly awful book from a great writer,"I'm not sure what happened here but Morris ruined his reputation as a great historian by writing one of the most bizzare books ever written. It is the book equivilant of ""Plan Nine From Outer Space."" It is done to one cent on the used market but not sure it is a bargin, even at that price"
2,Little interest,"When I read of a politicians biography, I want to read aboutthe decisions and the challengers that they faced. With Reagan for example I would like to read more about his economic and military defense programs. This book I don't believe does this. We have here a fairly average study of Reagan as a person and far too much on the biographer."
2,Mediocre,"What to say about ""Dutch.""Unlike many people, I was initially intrigued with the rather unique narrative style. It's a memoir of one man's search for Reagan, essentially.But after a mere fifty pages, it got old. The language is flowering, and Edmund Morris' other books are amazing. This one, however, seems lost in its self-involvement. It goes nowhere and takes it's time doing so. Repetitive descriptions of small Illinois towns and quaint lifestyles becomes played out quickly. Perhaps the book gets considerably better, but from my understanding there is little in the way of politics in it, which makes me feel that if I didn't like the book after the first 50 pages of the early days of the author and Reagan in Illinois, it's not going to get any better.Pass."
1,Painful to read.,"I am a Reagan fan, but this book was absolutely painful to read. Morris did a terrible job with a great subject."
1,Aaaaarrrrrgggghhhh! What a waste!!!,I absolutely loved Morris' first two volumes of his Teddy R. bio. Was he insane when he came up with this approach to his Reagan book?
2,A Disappointment,"Let me qualify my opinion here: 200 Years from now, I firmly believe that when historians look back they will view the Greatest Presidents as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Ronald Reagan.That being said, this book was rather disappointing. After reading it (which was NOT an easy thing to do), I felt that I HAD learned a lot about where President Reagan came from and what motivated him, but I also felt that entirely too much time was devoted to the author himself and his little escapades.Given the rare opportunity that the author had, I was hoping for a book that would look more towards how he will be remembered and less of what one person thought about how things seemed."
2,No go,"The fact that the otherwise respectable Morris had to spend so much time, when this hyped title first appeared, defending his choice to insert a fictional self into this weird biography tells you just what you think it does: this book is a bomberoo."
4,"An insightful, important portrayal, a must read.","Contoversial style debates aside,a thoroughly enjoyable and informative book. It read, as promised, as a memoir, not a textbook. Morris' technique opened a window that provided insight into Reagan the man that we otherwise wouldn't have gotten. A fitting portrayal of the President whose legacy looms large over history and the future. A little too much Morris and not enough of the presidential years keeps me from giving it 5 stars."
3,Fictional character a common device.,"The narrative voice of any novel, fiction or non-fiction, is a character unto itslef. What Morris is being villified for is just a varying degree of the same beast. It is obvious from 60 Minutes that Morris cares for Reagan, and the problem that Reagan insiders seem to have is that Morris shows the kinks in the armor of this alleged knight. They hold Reagan up as a symbol of America like the flag: not to be burned, not to be desecrated. Instead of a biographer, perhaps they should have hired a propagandist."
3,Worth a try,"This book was a challenge to read. Much has been said about how Morris inserted himself into Reagan's history and how poorly he does it. I would have to agree with that point. The device does not bother me as much as the execution. I find it very difficult to believe that Reagan was responsible for Morris's son, Gavin, going underground. For the first half of the book, this book is basically a Morris autobiography with Reagan as a side character, not the other way around. Once he tackled the presidency years, the book took a turn for the better. If you are at all interested in Reagan, this book is worth it. But wading through some of the minutia may be difficult for some readers."
2,A bum job on a bum job,"Everyone knows this book is a bomberoo, despite some defences of it in the highbrow media. True, it was a difficult task to do a biography of this vapid president, but after reading this fictitious (and bizarre) memoir I don't feel I know much more then when I began."
2,Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"This book fulfilled two old adages. The first ""you can not judge a book by its cover"" and second ""you get what you pay for"".I bought this book for 75 cents at a garage sale and it was a great looking hardcover book with a great nice cover and in new condition.I had not read any Amazon reviews or any other reviews until I finished reading the book. It was the weirdest biography I have ever read. Much of the book was written in the first person by and about the author. It was often not very fair or favorable to Dutch and seemed to take cheap shots at him.After reading the other reviews I do not know what to believe is true or not true in this book.It is different read and I will probably read another Reagan biography or his autobiography to get other views of him as he is one of our greatest, most important presidents. I am glad I did not pay any more for the book.Charlie"
1,Worst Biography I have Ever Read,"I have never read a biography where the author writes more about himself than about the subject of the book. When I read that Morris was ""The Official"" Reagan biographer, I was really looking forward to reading it. It was all I could do to finish it. My wife asked why I kept reading it and I replied that I like to finish what I start.Morris keeps reminding us that he grew up near Reagan and went to college with him for a semester. Wow!I wondered the entire book, like the young lady on the plane to Geneva asked him, ""Do you like the President?"" I don't think he did. He and his stupid friend Paul Rae kept making fun of him the entire book, or until Rae dies. And then he tells us what his lefty, stupid son thought and said. Who cares?Very poor."
2,Dutch : A Memoir of Ronald Reagen,"I began to read this book about one of my heroes and have lost interest in the book. It might be better titled as ""Dutch and Me"". I wanted to read about Ronald Reagan, not about the biographer and his ties to Mr. Reagan. I may pick the book up again and read it when there is nothing else for me to do. then I might change my mind, but I doubt I will. One of my few disapointments in all the books I have read in the past."
2,Little man attempts Big Book,"As one proceeds through this book it becomes apparent the subjectand task are too big for the author. That he resorts to a formwhich injects himself into one of the more epochal periodsof our history-the defeat of the 'Evil Empire'-suggests some needto be important. Unlike other presidential biographers, he seems to lack the creative ability and understanding of his subject to succeed in a more traditional form. His opinions override the content and soil it.It is an unimportant book."
4,An unusual but motivating memoir of the life of Ronal Reagan,"It took me a while to overcome the fiction inserted by the author. I wish he had found a way to tell the story without it. Nevertheless, the biography chronicles the life of a contemporary man and gives us the insight of an author who had direct access, at a high level, to a sitting president and his staff.Surely, from this account, one can be inspired, as I was, of the significance of Ronald Reagan's great vision for America and her unique moral position in the world. I found myself inspired and remembered how unlikely it seemed in the late 70,s that anyone as conservative as Ronald Reagan could ever reach the Presdidency. I am glad he did and I believe the author in his uncoventional way portrayed Reagan as a great and unique leader who is credited for standing up to too much government in the US and totalitarianism in the World."
2,Missed Opportunity,"I did not get to read Dutch until after it had been given bad reviews by the media. I was able to keep an open mind about the book. However, upon starting the book, I soon agreed with the criticism. I skipped numerous pagers (gladly) to avoid Morris's fictional characters. I feel that Morris missed an incrediable opportunity on this book. He had such close access to the presidency and such a free hand, and he blew it. I expected a thorough biography of a great president. Instead I got a large editorial of fiction/history. I am glad to say that the latter part of the book strayed away from the author's fictionl creations. Too many important details were skipped over or simply mentioned briefly. I can only hope that someone else will come along and try to make up where Morris fell so short, and give us an exhaustive work on Ronald Reagan. I feel he deserves it."
2,Is It Real or Is It Memorex?,"Will the real Ronald Reagan please stand up? Will the author of this biography please sit down?What happened when I read this book? Did I learn more about Ronald Reagan and the people around him? Yes. Could I tell what was real and what was invented? No. Did I stay up late trying to finish it? No... getting through this book took awhile. It was not an easy read. I had heard this was a ""unique"" biography, written from the perspective of the author as a fictional character (!), and it seemed that way.I understand historical fiction, and I understand biography. I guess I am having some difficulty with melding the two, particularly with Reagan, who WAS larger than life. I wanted to learn more about the man and his presidency, and I was left hanging.Another biography will eventually come out. How long can you wait?"
1,H O R R I B L E,If you want to read about Edmund Morris and his fantasy world check this book out! And if you want obscure french phrases in every 3rd paragraph check this book out! Maybe it gets better after the first 40 pages but only my trashcan knows for sure.
2,dutch,"The author writes to much about himself in this story. I expected this book to be about Reagan. We do not need to know what type of car Dick Morris was driving; or about his personal relationship with his wife. This book is long and rambling. I find it hard to believe this is the same author that wrote Theodore Rex. Maybe Mr. morris would have been better served to write two books; one an autobiography( which he comes close to in this book, and a book about DUTCH"
3,A Good Reflection Upon One of America's Worst Presidents,"I am no fan of Ronald Reagan. It was the awful policies of the Reagan Administration that has created the huge national debt that hangs over our heads still today. However, I have to admit this was a very decent and honest memoir that does not particularly support or oppose Reagan. It sets out all the facts. The fictional characters brought a more human quality to the book, making so much more than just a historical textbook. Dutch is indeed worth the read."
4,A puzzle but worth it.,"I found this book to be fascinating. It takes about 200 pages to get used to the author's style of writing and then it is full speed ahead. I liked the fictional characters inserted by the author because, for me, it made the subject of the book more interesting. It puts you INTO the book and almost makes you feel that you are there, in time, with Reagan, instead of just merely reading about him. I have recommended it to all my friends."
3,An important book but somewhat unsatisfying,"If you're interested in the Reagan presidency, this book is worth reading, flaws and all. For Edmund Morris, kudos for daring to do something different. For me, the technique failed, please don't do it again Mr. Morris.I read a novel differently than I do a biography, and found myself continually off balance as I read this book. When one reads a biography, one learns not just about the subject, but also about the times and the people who were around the subject. In this book, one is left with considerable confusion about what was real and what was conjecture on the part of the author.It is clear the Ronald Reagan is one of a kind. I'm not a serious student of history, but I don't know of any other great leader, past or present, in government or any other field, with his combination of personal characteristics. It's worth understanding this man better, even if one has to put up with Morris's flawed biographical technique."
1,"""Dutch"" - A big disappointment!",Very disappointed in this book. What a sorry example of what should be an official biography of a president. One can't determine what is fact and what is fiction. After reading such books as Truman by McCullough it was really a letdown to dig into this book. I certainly wouldn't recommend this for any serious reader of presidential biographies.
1,"Its a memoire, not a biography... just bad writing!","It's a shame that Edmund Morris squandered such an unprecedented opportunity. DUTCH is a disservice to Regan and the country. In the end, it's just self indulgent junk writing."
1,Save your money and your time. Not a book worth reading,"Morris brings disdain, arrogance and cynicism to everthing he writes about, whether it is American culture, Christianity and the church, life in the mid west, or the person he is writing about. I finished 100 pages and decided to stop reading. His insertion of himself as the main character is arrogant, distracting and downright annoying. He constantly corrects Ronalds memories of his own life (while ironically maintaining that Raegan has a near photographic memory). I bought the book with eager anticipation and am very disappointed. Nancy Reagan is right - he wasted a unique opportunity to do an adequate job of a biography. He failed miserably at that task."
2,Disappointed- More about Morris than Reagan,Best advice I received on this book was read the prologue and then skip to chapter 28. The first 400 pages are spent by Morris writing about his own fantasy childhood. The chapters on Reagan's precidency are interesting but lack insight into his decision making process.
1,truly abysmal,"I took mr.Morris's advice and waited to read this book before commenting on it.I can safely say that it is appallingly bad!How dare Edmund Morris insert himself into Reagan's life story?The book should be titled""Edmund& Dutch"",since it seems to be mostly about mr.Morris.How come Carl Sandburg never thought to include himself in Abe Lincoln's life story?He could have had a ball writing about double dating with Abe and Ann Rutledge in New Salem!And David Mcculloch should have written about his days as an apprentice in Harry Truman's haberdashery!Who cares if they weren't born yet!Details,details!That doesn't bother Edmund Morris any!Perhaps when Morris spent time with Reagan,he was horrified to discover that there was no ""there"" there,{as Gertrude Stein said once about Oakland)but then if that's the case,he should never have written the book."
1,A great piece of fiction - when does the movie come out?,"A terribly disappointing book. Although Morris is talented, he falls far short of writing any sort of satisfying biography. The book was more reminiscent of a rather inane soap opera than an objective look at a former President. Also, the fictionalization was quite distracting, and the author's blatant inclusion of himself into the ""story"" line was just tacky."
3,a reader's delight,"If you can get past the new form of biographical writing Morris uses for ""Dutch,"" you will find it a wonderful read. The first half is historical fiction and the second more like what the title says, ""a memoir."" This book won't be to some people's taste, but if you approach it with an open mind, you will be entertained! Consider that this was the man who wrote the classic Roosevelt biography."
2,Dutch:A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"An excellent writer, with a unique and compelling literary device, looses the focus of his endeavor. Mr. Morris becomes obsessed with his make believe place in history and spins a useless tale of his fake heritage, youth, education and social status. As such the line between the real and the imagined become hopelessly confussed to the detriment of the subject. In addition Mr. Morris's inclination to jump in time permantely muddies the literary water of his work. That someone granted such a unique opportunity, with one of our great post war leaders, and squanders it on self absorbed indulgence is a true tradegy."
1,Much left to desire in Dutch,"Having enjoyed immensely the Pulitzer price winning ""The Rise of Theordore Roosevelt"", I was anxious to read another biography by the same author. Big mistake. Dutch uses a completely different style of writing that I do not appreciate at all. The author invents a character whose biography follows loosely the geographic history of the real subject Ronald Reagan. He uses this trick to add more color where he admits he otherwise had little material. I found it quite distracting and did not make it far before I put the book aside. Others have found the book a good read, but my copy is now a doorstop."
1,More revealing of Morris' character than Reagan's,"Morris had the opportunity of a lifetime and blew it. Unparalleled access to a sitting president, and Morris can't understand what made Reagan larger than life? Morris seems utterly disappointed that Reagan is not Teddy Roosevelt, and proceeds to paint Reagan as a amiable dullard pretending to be president. Morris misses the mark, and his invective only throws his aim off even more. Edmund Morris comes off as an erudite Michael Moore."
1,extremely disappointed,"It is a literary trajedy that Morris squandered the opportunity to do a thorough historical biography on this interesting President. The book is poorly organized, difficult to follow and demonstrates Morris' obvious contempt for Reagan, his family and his country. I have anxiously awaited this book. I am so disappointed."
1,The Sin Of Hubris,"The chief job of the historian is to remain distant from his subject so that, at the very least, a semblance of objectivity can remain. True objectivity is of course a myth, but a good historian will at least make the effort to avoid emotional involvement with his subject.Morris doesn't even try to be objective, and in fact became so close to his subject that he inserts himself into the text as a major player. The historian is the observer, the recorder, and the chronologer, not the participant. Morris blew it. If you insist on buying this book, stick it on your self next to Dinesh D'Souza's tome and other bad hagiographies of Reagan."
1,Distracting,"From what I have read, I find that Morris' unusual bioigraphical technique is distracting from the story itsef. Rather than concentrate on the life of Ronald Reagan, I am involved with his so-called 'friend'. Morris should NOT have disclosed that the narrator is fictional. Then, perhaps the reader would enjoy this biography for what it is. (Actually...boring)"
1,Natch for Dutch,"Irritation is the one word that pops into my head when I think about this book. The cutesy literary techniques, etc, are self-indulgent of Morris and are a hindrance to any reader that doesn't desire delving into the footnotes every three pages. Finally, (and this is something I haven't seen mentioned that much --) is it really necessary to refer to Reagan as the childhood ""Dutch"" over and over again? Childhood nicknames are one thing, but to carry the notion on to a sitting president is more than a little insulting and infanticizing. Can't wait to read TR."
2,Disappointing,"Obviously, most readers of presidential history know that this is considered perhaps the most controversial biography ever written.The book has its decent points and does give a lot of insight into Reagan's life, but the reader must always remember that its Morris' view of Reagan's life--via his fictionalized characters--and thus could be viewed in a fictionalized light.I guess my overall view is that Morris, in spite of other great works he has delivered, really let the American public down in the first ""authorized"" presidential biography.There's no doubt that Ronald Reagan was an incredibly private man. That being said, there's probably only one person on the face of the earth who ever got to know his heart and that person will never ""kiss and tell""--Nancy Reagan.Morris could have done better."
1,Waste of Time,Terrible writer who is more in love with his own pompous ass than in writing an informative and usefull book on the subject at hand.Can't believe something like this ever went to print.
1,unreadable,I looked forward to this book as I knew the author had extensive access to the President. I requested this book for Christmas! Unhappily when I started to read it I discovered the writter was much more interested in himself than his subject. If you are interested in the life of Mr Morris than I suggest you purchase this book. If you thought you might get some insight into Mr.Reagan you might be disapointed.
5,Great product and best price,Was looking for a K&N filter that would fit my '49 GMC truck's carb. This one fits just right using the supplied hose clamp and looks great.
3,Sara La Grande,"To all Saritas Fans Hellow! The cd was not her best La bien paga,Toda una vida where good,I think she needs a better aranger, If anyone knows how to purchase her vhs movies,VARIETES,LA MUJER PERDIDA,SAMBA.ESA MUJER and more please let me know.sonoranav@aol.com Mauricio"
2,Sorry work for a great star,"I became very disappoited when I listened to this CD. Under the very beautiful picture of the cover there wasn't much of the great singer she is. Her aged voice is in many tracks simply hidden by the typical hateful arrangements of the 70's. Except for the bolero ""Toda Una Vida"" and la gitana ""La Bien Pagá"", there is nothing else to hear. Unexcused the absence of ""Maria de La O"" and ""Luna de España"" the best she recorded in the 70's. I do worship Sara Montiel and all her records but this one is not worth buying. Now I see the reason why there is no real audio tracks samples available in any of the stores that sells this one. The stores on line should offer better works of this great Spanish singer. We're longing to buy her good CDs. Mark. For more information about Sara Montiel,contact:"
5,¡¡MARAVILLOSA!! Super Sara,"Este CD es un ""monumento"" a Sarita Montiel, comprenlo, quien sabe cuanto tiempo vaya a estar en existencia. Si ustedes quieren contáctenme yo tengo CD's nuevos de Sara Montiel, los que tengo a la venta son: ""Besos de fuego"" ""Esa mujer"" (2) ""La bella Lola"" ""La reina del chantecler"" ""La violetera"" ""La dama de Beirut"" mi e-mail es: ""sra_laura@latinmail.com"" o ""gorm7208@prodigy.net.mx"" ¡¡Esta mujer es una belleza y tiene una voz!! Saludos desde: Guadalupe, Nuevo León México."
1,sin sorpresas,"Sara Montiel es una vieja zorra y este cd es una muestra de la basura que hacía durante el mandato de Franco. No me extraña que se lo hubieran montado juntos. Ahora, vieja, gorda y desgastada me da asco, y encima apoya a José Bono, un sinverguenza de cuidado"
3,Land Conservancy a basic textbook,This is much more like a textbook than a guide for working land trusts. It's a bible of sorts though and well written. Informative; slightly dated. Well worth buying as a reference book to get your conservation organization off the ground. See LTA.org for more current info.JB
4,Exploring the Dark side of Death,"Even old issues of Granta are on the edge of what's hot and new!This issue deals with death, both future and past. The series of short stories by some of the most hot authors around, all seem to flow easily from one story to the next.Includes Jeremy Harking, John Gregory Dunne, Eugene Richards, Edmund White, Teresa Pamies, Mary McCarthy, Adam Mars-Jones, Roger GTarfitt, Michael Ignatieff, John Treherne, William Cooper, Rudolf Schafer, Christopher Petit, and oddly enough Louise Erdrich.The photographs are all very moving and fit right in with the shorts. If you have ever sat still and wondered about your future fate, or reflected upon what comes at the end, this is a book worth reading -- if only for the reflections that it might cause you."
1,Tempos are too slow,"If you hear Marie-Claire Alain's interpretation of these works you will be disappointed with this CD. Chorzempa's tempos are sometimes half the tempo, making some of the themes difficult to follow or even recognize. The CD has excellent moments and the sound take is perfect. His choice of stops are sometimes puzzling, with almost machine-like results. The slow tempos rob the listener from the joy of fluid technical phrasing."
3,"Great guitar sound, dull songs","I want to like this CD more than I do, but every time I listen to it I have the same reaction. There are beginnings of good songs, but the band doesn't follow through. I'm gving it 3 stars for excellent musicianship, especially the guitar. My problem with it is the structure of the songs. So many of them start out with a great riff and then the song tones down and the vocals are a breathy whisper which negates the power of the guitar. I wanted the singer to just sing, belt it out, let go, but it almost never happens. I love the raw, low edge of the guitar, but in the end the songs end up fairly dull."
4,Took me by surprise,"Well I will have to say, when I first sampled a track from these guys I thought I was hearing another 80's band and didn't think much of them. Then 2 years later a friend gave me the cd to listen to. It only had to hear it twice and I was hooked ! Great vocals and Shane is an awesome drummer. Take the time to listen...you won't be disappointed !"
3,Gymnastic Riding System,"I found this book different from most other equestrian books, and with that it was very refreshing. However I must admit that for the rider on a busy schedule some of the ideas listed may not be very practical. I did , however find this book to be a great tool for some of my young beginning riders as it helps them get off on the right foot. It seems these concepts would be easier to master on a clean slate."
4,Atrocious code is still with us!,"The most interesting thing about Kernighan & Plauger's collection is that they took their bad examples from published textbooks and articles.Unfortunately, today's authors and course instructors are still turning out atrocious code, now in C++, Java, and VB. The examples may be dated, but the principles remain valid."
4,Trees and Forests,"On a recent programming forum, a poster asked if he should code his program as one procedure like his boss instructed. He was, of course, greeted with polite howls of protest. Everyone offered (mostly) good ideas about how one should code if one is a beginner. After a while, I realized they all could be traced back to Elements of Programming Style. I pulled out my first edition and browsed it. Still the best book on style ever. Unfortunately, some of their suggestions, like minimize your use of GO TOs, have now been taken as so many commandments that many languages have now deleted them entirely.Their use of Fortran and PL/1 is hardly a problem. Any competent programmer should be able to read the examples easily and understand the point of the example. If it is a problem for you, I'd suggest you start with an easier book and build up to Elements of Programming Style. The style of which, by the way, is modelled after The Little Book aka Elements of Style by Strunk and White."
2,Badly dated,"Although this book was needed in its day (copyright 1978, 1974), many of the examples are so dated that they've lost their relevance. Steve Maguire's more recent ""Writing Solid Code"" covers the very same material, but uses examples written in C rather than Fortran and PL/C. I recommend it instead."
5,wonderful story and great illustrations!,This is the most charming children's book I've ever encountered...I always give it as a baby shower gift. It's even better with the musical CD!
5,Beautiful story and illustrations,"We are big fans of the Jimmy Buffet song, Jolly Mon. To further the experience, we purchased this book for our 6 year old daughter. While she is a good reader, there are lots of words and the font is small, so we read it to her; which is fine because there is a lot to learn from this story. The illustrations are beautiful and the last page has the words and notes to the song. We are really happy with our purchase!"
5,Great kids book.,"My boys were already fans of the song the Jolly Mon, so it only made sense that they would like the book too. My 4 year old loves it. He wants me to read it every night now. The only drawback is I may have to read this book every night for the next month...."
3,Sweet Story,"This is a sweet story but I found the narration by Jimmy B. and his daughter a little lacking. I'm a Jimmy Buffet fan no doubt. I just don't think voice overs are his thing. It is cool to hear him doing something with his daughter though. Like I said, it's sweet but I don't think we will pull this one off the shelf very often."
5,Hats off to Buffett!,"I ordered this for my niece, I read it and it is wonderful! I will be puchasing another copy for my child as well. This book takes your imagination far away to Bananaland where things are peaceful and happy! If only the real world could be so wonderful. This tale will delight readers of all ages! Buffett has done a great job with his awesome imagination! All of his books are a breath of fresh air for the weary mind. He should write more than he does! And Lambert Davis did a great job with his colorful images, you felt like Bananaland was real!"
5,Rating,Mitsuko is one of the the the best piano players in the world. Her expression and the intensity she puts in every moment of the music is abslutelly fantastic. I'm her indefectible fan!
2,Manufacturer unclear on concept,"I purchased this item without examining it in a store, thinking there was nothing to see. Wrong. The back side of these ""page markers"" is white. That means -all- the colors look the same from the back, so if you use a color scheme for some research project, you won't find it as easy or quick to move around in a heavily-flagged book.UPDATE: Six years later, these are still around my desk, getting very little use. But here's an update, for which I dropped them from 2 to 1 star: the adhesive is failing! These come off their pads as if there were no adhesive at all, unlike the usual Post-It notes, which seem to keep sticking forever. Caveat emptor!"
5,What I needed,"Cheaper buying here than at Walmart, especially when they don't always stock it at Walmart. Great for my book notes for gaming."

5,NUFF RESPECT,"Nuff respect to Beres for the riddims and words of sincerity on this CD. This is a classic one. Wicked, mon!"
5,Beres at his best,"i have heard all of Beres Hammonds albums and i truely believe he is the has is the best reagge artist alife. He is truely untouchable. And this album proves it, next to his album ""In Control"" this is probably the second best cd he has made. This album plays nice mellow riddums non stop from start to finish. Tracks that prove to stand out the most are ""sorry mi breathen"" ""this love"" ""can you play some more"" etc. I can go on as a matter of fact i cannt remeber on single of tune track this album was put together well."
5,Beres Hammond is the Best,He is so intellegent. Mr Hammond uses his thoughts and feeling to enlighten his listeners. He is truely a great artist.
5,This album is HOT!!!!!,"Beres has done what I thought would be impossible and produced an album which exceeds all his past endeavours. The lyrics, the music and the attitude are tight from tracks 1 to 14. It is hard for me to offer a favorite since i am still trying to decide on one! All I can say is that this CD has been a permanent fixture in my CD player since the day I got it. Wonderful love songs and great insight on social issues, mixed with Beres' smooth voice make this the CD on top of the must get list! Love it!"
1,Disappointing!,I am a collector/fan of Beres CDs. I recently hunted down JetStarR. Mix excellent! Then I rushed out and bought A Day in the Life. Seems to me that this album is more about the money than the sincere expression of human feelings through music.
4,Definitely for Gadget Geeks (like me),"This is a cool book for those that are interested in gadgets and survival in general. I would have liked more photos (especially more close-ups). A full-color edition would really put this book over the top. All in all, if you enjoy this kind of thing, this is a very interesting and enjoyable book. The book included good, up-to-date lists of where to come up with the various items that the author uses and reviews."
4,Good Book,"Really liked many if the kit designs. The book pointed out many items that I now have added to my kits. If you are makeing a small survival kit, car kit or the world is going to hell kit, this is the book for you. Good Job."
5,The Perfect Survival Kit,"The title says it all. This book is a must if you are a prepper (new/old). This book is also a great find for backpackers/outdoors types. Gives you everythng you would need to help you out in any situation, large or small. I HIGHLY recommend this book."
4,its a keeper,"this book has been reviewed by myself many a times and still i am hoping for the author to provide an update to this book and do a better job of explaining what pouches, packs etc.i tried to make up the backpack survival kit with the external pouches. no go. i did not have the room that he did. but it made a very good base for my bug-out-bag."
5,Excellent read.,"I am very glad I bought this book. The writer does a great job of explaining different items that do the same task. He isn't trying to ""sell"" you any one product or brand. I like that. Thanks to this book, I now have a great kit in my personal vehicle that I hope I never have to use lol"
4,"more, More, MORE Muppets!","I am a HUGE fan of the Muppets and have been wanting the Muppet Show on DVD for Ages! Keep them coming - PLEASE!Dissappointed that some things were cut and wish they had the extras like there is on the Fraggle Rock First Season set like the desktop themes.One great extra in this set that isn't in the Fragge Rock set is the ""Muppet Morsels"". If you fall asleep during the slow parts, make sure you turn on this feature. It tells background info on who wrote the music, who is performing what Muppet, Jim Henson & Company history and more. I find it a lot less intrusive than the voice over commentaries that some DVDs have.A wonderful gift for your favorite Muppet maniac!"
3,Picture and Sound Not Very Good,"I purchased this DVD set for my son because I loved it so much myself as a kid. The picture is not great and neither is the sound. To be honest I don't know what I saw in it as a kid, I really have not enjoyed watching them again. My son is not into them either. Times change I guess."
3,M:uppets Show Season 1,Purchased for an eleven yr. old girl. Some of the Muppets guest stars were unknown to her and the jokes references over her head. Would say the DVD is for an previous and older age bracket.
5,In response to Jerry Edwards,"Jerry Edwards mentioned he thought that Sesame Street characters only appeared in one episode. I know of two more episodes, Jerry: Marty Feldman, in which practically the whole Sesame Street cast shows up for a musical number, and I *think* Big Bird makes a guest appearance in the same episode as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans."
5,"Like taking a trip in the ""way back"" machine ...","Fabulous! This brings back so many memories - a slice of culture to be tasted, for sure."
4,Not the Best But Still Entertaining,"Like the show itself, the shows on these sets of DVDs improve as they move forward chronologically, primarily because as the show became more popular, it was able to attract better guest stars. Thus, the shows from Season 3 are better than those from Season 1. The guests on this set of 4 disks include:Disc 1:Juliet ProwseConnie StevensJoel GreyRuth BuzziRita MorenoJim NaborsDisc 2:Florence HendersonPaul WilliamsCharles AznavourHarvey KormanLena HornePeter UstinovBruce ForsythDisc 3:Sandy DuncanCandice BergenAvery SchreiberBen VereenPhyllis DillrVincent PriceDisk 4:Valerie HarperTwiggyEthel MermanKaye BallardMummenschanz"
5,Great Entertainment!!!,"I remember watching these shows on our grainy black and white TV as a kid. I loved them then, and I love them even more now. My kids love the series, too. Season 2 is a must-have for this household!!! Hieeeeee-YAH!!!! LOL"
3,Season 1 mostly for avid Muppet fans only,"Some stand-out episodes (Peter Ustinov and Andy Williams for two) but overall a weak opening for the show. The writing, acting, and directing improved immensely in the series' later seasons. I'm buying every set to have a complete collection but can't really recommend most of this season's episodes on their own merit.On the technical side, the remastering of both video and audio looks great and the DVD extras add a lot of value to the package."
4,Missing Skit(s).,"I am a huge Jim Henson fan and absolutely love this set. That said, there is at least 1 skit/song missing from this set. On the original, Vincent Price sang James Taylor's ""You've Got a Friend"" for the episode finale. That skit/song is absent from the DVD. There may be other missing skits...buyer beware."
5,Also no booklet,Count me in the people who don't have a booklet. You would think there would be one to at least list the contents of each DVD.
3,Muppet-season 1,"My only complaint would be that the ""special edition"" did not come with anything in it other than the DVD's. I don't know if that is how it should come, or if materials were somehow taken out/removed before shipping. I assume there should be some written materials to identify what episodes are on which of the 4 discs. That information is not written on the disk either, so the only way to find out is to watch the DVD."
3,The Muppet Show - Season One (Special Edition),"If you like to chuckle and laugh then you will like the Muppet Show. There are a lot of showbix cliches and corny jokes. The older set will appreciate the guest stars that appear. Many of the younger group will probably ask just who are these people. While the older group will get a laugh out of just how young some were. Like Vincent Price, Jim Neighbors & Paul Williams.From my recollections of watching the original shows it appears to be missing some of the scenes. Don't know why that was done but what is there is still great. Maybe they will re-master it again and include the 'Missing Scenes""."
3,Cannot skip during show...,"Yeah, there was much ado about the Muppet's release. Yeah, I was a huge fan and rushed out to get the DVD. Yeah, I fall asleep during each episode.The shows are cute, funny and a bit long and borring. (Sarcasm to follow) The upside is that now that is is on DVD I can skip through the skits that I don't like and watch just the good ones, or at least the ones I like. However, it seems this ability does not work on any of my DVDs. Anyone have the same problem?Otherwise the shows are fine a little ole 70s flashback... with fur!"
2,We are not amused,"Maybe after I take some time to watch the whole set I'll feel better about this, but right now all I feel is ripped off.I watched this show with my daughter when it first aired. She was 6 at the time. I bought Season 1, looking forward to watching it with *her* daughter. I was especially looking forward to seeing the episode with Charles Aznavour. I had fond memories of him singing Dance In the Old Fashioned Way to Miss Piggy, although I could be wrong, because for some reason, that segment of the show seems to have been replaced by a band singing Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor On the Bedpost Over Night?*Not* what I was expecting, and if I'd known the sequence was going to be cut, (leaving me to wonder what else may have been cut) I'd have saved my money and bought King Kong in the fall.As far as I'm concerned, this was a disappointment."
2,Muppett Show - Season One DVD,"The DVD was damaged upon receipt from the USPS. I could not imagine how poorly packed the DVD was when sent to us. It was packaged in the shell of a cardboard box, with a strip of cardboard on top of it and then taped with a packing tape without any cushioning inside. During the busy holiday season, it was crushed, and the DVD damaged as well. I returned it via USPS, using a cushioned envelope from the USPS (often used for books). The return procedure was user-friendly online and efficient."
1,Boring,Complete waste of money. Our children were begging us to shoot them after only 20 minutes of this drivel. It did not hold my attention either. Overrated tripe that many sellers are no doubt trying to unload.
3,Recollections,"Having picked up seasons 2 and 3 of ""The Muppet Show"", I felt I had to seek out season 1. If you're a muppets fan and care about the fuzzy packaging, buy early -- my season 1 set lacks it.The packaging is otherwise good.DVD video and sound quality are exceptional for a videotaped program this age.But as others have said time and time again, it's been butchered. This means songs, and some lead-ups to them, have been excised (for copyright or contractual reasons). Cutting up episodes like this is rather like selling a prosthetic hand after chopping off two of the fingers. It's there, but it just doesn't feel complete.On a personal level, as I've always found the skits to be funny and the songs more often that not a nuisance, I'm not that much bothered - except the lack of chapter cuts makes manual fast forwarding annoying.It's still a reasonable collector's piece, but if you're a fan of the songs, you may be in for a shock."
4,Not complete?,"Is there a reason why some of the episodes are edited? Music copyright issues again? I just watched the Vincent Price show looking forward to my favorite skit ""You've Got a Friend"" - imagine my surprise when it wasn't there. Yes, I am very glad that we have the Muppets on dvd at all, but why does everything have to be tampered with?"
4,The index mistery,"I've received my copy of the show several days ago. It's great to watch it again!However, there is one thing that sturtles me. There is no index! There is a pocket that surely was ment to have some kind of a booklet with the list of the episodes and the scetches but there is nothing inside. Just 4 CDs! Has this happened to anybody else?"
5,Muppet Mania,"This stuff is as good today as it was some 30 years ago. I was a Muppet Manic then, and, having now revisited Kermit and the gang, I remain as Manic as ever."
5,Brings Back Great Memories of Great Performers,"Not only do you have the Great Muppet Cast with Jim Henson but all the great performers we 40 something year olds remember from our generation of television.The slapstick comedy reminds me of the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, Mr.Bean and Walace and Gromit. These DVDs keep me amused for hours. Even my 6year old stepdaughter loves the shows and she is a hard critic to please. The great thing is she is introduced to a whole new set of characters and performers that she would not have seen before."
5,Muppets for all generations,"The Muppet Show - Season One (special edition) - is as entertaining today as it was when current. My grandchildren, ages 4 & 5, beg to see it again and again. I learned how sophisticated their senses of humor were when I watched this DVD with them! I recommend it to everyone!!!"
4,Muppets live again.,"There have been many good reviews of the series itself earlier so I won't repeat too much of that.The 24 episodes on the 4 DVDs are somewhat different than the later Muppet show most of us remember. A lot of characters and skits were still being experimented with, or not present yet, and even Gonzo is a very minor character in this season. The content is intended for a somewhat older audience than Sesame Street and the Muppet movies but there is a little something for everyone. The pitch and the pilot episode are included plus some other nice features.About the DVDs themselves, the sound & picture quality are both excellent, and the tri-fold case fits into a slip-cover. But the 4 DVDs are in only two sections of the tri-fold so each pair has one DVD overlapping the other. You pretty much have to put DVDs 3 & 4 into another case so you don't take a chance on damaging the other two.Hopefully they redesign the case for the following seasons."
5,Finally!,I've been waiting for the Muppet Show to come out on DVD. It is an excellent DVD. Great for anyone in the family.
5,It's the Muppet Show!,"This is a great DVD. If you loved the Muppet Show, you can't go wrong...not to mention this is from back in the day when they actually made more than 8 episodes a season, so it's definitely worth the cost."
4,It Really Makes Me Happy...,"I remember watching reruns of the Muppet Show when I was little (I wasn't even born when it first came on the air). I just loved it. I'm so very happy that they are beginning to release the episodes on DVD. My favourite on this is the one with Ethel Merman. The only complaint I have is that they cut out some of the scenes because of licensing issues. While this may not have been able to be helped, I'm just disappointed that I don't have the full episode on some of the episodes. Regardless, this is a great set and I plan on getting all of them when they are all released."
1,a waste of time with beautiful people,"spread was just a stupid movie with a lot f beautiful people. i'm glad i got it for a dollar because i would have been really pissed if i had to pay money for such a waste of a movie. It should have been a tv of the week movie on tv or basic cable or something, but hey remember this is just my opinion you who is reading this might love the movie so judge for your self."
4,Loved it,"Money, cars, the rich and powerful whats not to like! Highly recommended to Aston Kuthcer loooking for more than a romantic movie...."
3,Ashton!,Ashton makes this movie what it is. Although there is some romanticism there is also sketchy acting with the girl he falls in love with.
5,Anne Heche,Anne just looks so damn good. Worth every penny just to see her. Not bad for an old woman.
2,Kutcher is Bad,Ashton Kutcher should stick to playing idiots and doing moronic TV. He is not a good dramatic actor.this movie is ok to watch for the nudity and sex and that is about it. The characters are so unlikeablethat when you are suppose to actually feel for them it is impossible. Seems like Kutcher trying to breakout of his stupid doofus persona but he just can't escape that he is not a good actor.2 stars because it does have some hot naked women and some ok sex scenes almost ruined by the bigdoofus trying way to hard to be cool.
2,Beware of fragile hard drive and short warranty,"On April 16, 2003 I wrote a 5 star review of the Zen, raving about the interface and sound.However, my unit just stopped working. I called Tech support who diagnosed it as a hard drive failure and said that since it was beyond the 3 month warranty period, I would have to return it and could expect to pay $100 for a replacement hard drive. That I'm giving it 2 stars now is a testimony to how much I liked it before its premature death.I've read the reviews of the new IPOD and it seems like they have improved the interface to allow making playlists on the fly now and, at least according to one Amazon reviewer, the hard drive is extremely durable (unlike myself, he mentioned that he'd dropped his unit numerous times and it keeps on playing.)"
3,Don't buy it if you are considering a Mac,"Most of the top end Nomad devices are completely incompatible with Mac's, no matter what the website says, they neglect that the Nomad Jukebox is, but the Zen, II, III, etc. are NOT.Also, software with the device is terrible. Fine for a small library, but if you are planning to buy a large one, it is extremely difficult to view and manage.Device its self is fine. There is no fast forward or rewind within a song, so you must always start at the beginning, which is a problem if using it for audio books."
1,"Bad software, awful tech support","Bought this product all excited that it was cheaper than Ipod. 3 days after purchase, the unit would not power up or respond to reset buttons. I returned it to Creative ASAP. They did not test it for any problems for 4 weeks, until I threatened to demand a refund. It was returned to me the next day mysteriously and seemed to work fine. Except now there was a major software problem. The tech support does not answer emails - sometimes they even bounce back to sender. The phone techs were unhelpful, recommending that I reinstall Windows, which was not the answer I was looking for.In all, it is a very nice looking product, and the sound quality seems pretty good, but the software is a real disaster, and the tech support is worse. I've switched to IPod, and I can't in good conscience recommend that anyone buy this product."
4,SOLID,"Great MP3 player. Easy enough interface and file transfer. Took about a half hour to comfortably operate. Got over not having a stop button just as quickly. Accidently dropped it about 3 feet on the floor and it kept playing. USB 2.0 is very fast. Definately worth the investment. IPOD's only advantage to me is being cooler looking, but in all other respects the ZEN matches or beats it. Solid workhorse MP3 player. Would give it a 5 star rating but nothing is perfect."
2,Problem software,"The player itself is not so bad. The unit feels reasonably durable, although the the buttons are on the side of the unit. It would make more sense if the buttons were on the front where you could see them. Of course the price is the player's main plus. The problem is that the software that comes with the unit is terrible (several other reviewers have pointed this out). When you install the software on Windows XP, XP will warn you to NOT continue the installation. The instructions that come with the player say to ignore this warning. I wonder why. Could it be that it's because the software is terrible and will destabilize your PC? That's what happened to me. I had to reinstall XP.Advice: flash memory makers are going to be releasing flash memory cards (CompactFlash, etc.) up to 4GB soon. Hold off on buying an MP3 player until then. You'll get a smaller, high-capacity MP3 player without the breakable hard disk. Look for one that comes with some decent software."
2,Beware,"I own one of these. At first it was pure love... easy transfers, auto sync btween the player and the computer. Then I loaded it on a new computer and all hell broke loose. Now everytime I load the software or try to transfer songs they are tagged with the wrong artist and who isn't even on the artist list even the preloaded songs from the player. Tech support thus far has been no help I have loaded and cleared this program more times than I can count. Now I use it with Windows Media but it cannot keep the songs in order and will not load the songs from the player to the computer like the creative software does. When it worked I loved this program and device. When it doesn't... beware. The whole thing has me thinking about dumping it and getting an iPod."
1,Go with an IPod,"I bought the Nomad, thinking that I would save money and get similar quality to the Apple IPod. I couldn't have been more wrong.First off, the Creative transfer software is extremely lousy and I had to pay [money] to get a third-party solution that is only marginally better. Second, this thing is huge compared to an IPod. Third, it crashes! What good is an MP3 player that locks up on you?!? I've written to Creative many times, and all they've ever given me in return is a shrug and an ""oh, well, better luck next time."" ... Pay the extra [money] for an IPod and save yourself a giant headache."
2,"Bad software, doesn't work with USB 1.1","I bought a Nomad Zen for use with my Windows 98 powered PC, which is about two years old. It's too old to use with this product, unfortunately. The PlayCenter software continually crashes, I've installed and uninstalled and been with technical support for Creative on several occasions, and after a week, I've given up.I'm sure this is a marvelous piece of equipment if you have a PC that has USB 2.0 or Firewire, but even though it says it is USB 1.1 compatible, it's not.Besides the system crashes, my Zen also experienced very odd skips in songs, plus songs would start and others would take over, and the shuffle play feature played the same 10 songs over and over, despite the fact that I had over 200 loaded on.Besides that, the PlayCenter software that comes with the Zen is barely adequate, and Creative's tech support, while trying to be helpful, ultimately isn't.I recommend checking out the Ipod instead."
5,A Music Lover's Dream Come True,"The IPOD falls short of its target. However, The Nomad Jukebox does extremely well at reaching its goal. It carries a heck of a sound and the hard drive seems to never fill. Its looks are Slick and Cool, but the safety pouch it come in makes it a little bulgy. One true concern I have though is the software that comes with it. It's a pain to handle and just plain clumsy in its design. I've had to delete its contents twice already because when it was synchronizing with the PC it kept repeating some of the songs it already had. All in all though, the Hardware (the Jukebox itself) is excellent; I give it a 10++ out of 10. However, the software needs a lot of work. But, you can always use the Windows Media Player as a back up."
5,It's better than Ipod... sound wise,"I had an IPOD 10GB and the music sounded flat with no bass. I tried using other headphones but still sounded the same. But the Zen is different, the music sounds more fuller. If you like Nomad I /II you will definately love Zen. I have to admit, Ipod does look cooler because of its size and is white, but Zen seems to be more durable."
1,Waste of money!,I decided to save myself $200 by buying the Zen 2.0 rather than an iPod. What a mistake. I received it in mid-October. By mid-December the display screen no longer worked. Because I had memorized the menu system by that point I was still able to use the product. I went on vacation right after this happened and didn't have time to deal with getting this fixed under warranty. (So I'm not sure how helpful they are.) I continued to use the player until yesterday when it just completely died on me. That's why I decided to write this review. It's not worth the $200 I saved. It's too bulky. The software that it came with never worked properly either. It would never connect to the CDDB database to name the files so I had to do it manually until I finally got iTunes and started ripping CD's in that. What a pain in the butt! Take a guess what I'll be buying next. I had read other reviews talking about the screen display not working but decided to take my chances. I gambled and lost!
1,I do NOTrecomend The Zen!,"The idea was good, but the emplimentation Is BAD. First of all the zen's Buttons are TOO small. Second of all (maybe it's just me), but It has a very un-natural feel when you hold it in your hand. My Nomad ZEN also Quit after the first day. When I connected it Too my computer, and started running the PlayCenter software to transfer my MP3 collection to the Zen, It worked fine at first, but the Zen started to get very hot, and then when I tried to Syncronize my MP3s with the software It just Quit. Now it will not turn on or do anything. Maybe it was just a flaw in the one I got or something, but I am very angry that I only got one day to use something that I paid $230 for. Oh, the headphones have a very Cheap feal to them. Based on my experience I do NOT recomend the ZEN at all."
2,Tech support is the worst,"I got the Zen firewire all is good for about four month the pow the adudio is gone, Call up tech support. I know it only has a 3 month warranty and i agreed to it when a got it thinking its still cheeaper than the ipod by [$$$] bucks, it worked ok. So i call knowing its out of warranty figuring i'll pay to have it fixed they are afterall the manufacturer. Nope all they do is change batteries thats all the support for a [$$$] dollar piece of equipment that completely s[tin]ks.So save your money a bit longer and get the ipod."
3,"Good, but not great","Pluses: It definitely has a large capacity, and it has universal connections. Also the EAX can be both a plus and a minus as it drains battery life, but it it can aid in the experience. It is an awesome player though. Sound quality is superbMinuses: Software is buggy, player is a little large, i have large hands so it was ok, but my friend could barely grasp it. Its proprietary connection requires u to carry around a floppy disk and install programs so you can use it as a portable hard drive, which kind of defeats the purpose of being portable. And it came with an AOL cd, which immediately turned me off. ALso the remote for it [costs extra.]Overall the mp3 playing aspect of it is superb, while the computer interface is sketchy at best, and the HDD aspect is only productive for personal use as an extra HDD for your computer, but not for file sharing purposes."
1,Don't buy - Won't print after six weeks!,"I would not buy this again. After less than six weeks the paper feed no longer works, which basically means I can't print anything. The problem is described in multiple reviews (which I read only after I started having problems). Each sheet of paper needs to be manually feed and even then it only picks up the paper one out of six times.HP support was rude and not very helpful concerning a problem that seems to be pretty common.I'm just hoping they recall the printer so I can get a refund."
1,This printer sucks!,"after only 2 months of light use - it started refusing to feed the paper! - I tried everything I could - nothing works. I am so frustrated with it. I also bought a computer from HP - problems as well: DVD writer is missing drivers, tons of preinstalled garbage software. Fan broke after 5 months of use.I am NOT BUYING HP EVER AGAIN!!!"
1,What the hell is the point?!,"This jerk sold me the printer with no power cord or printer cord and although its easy to find the printer cord, the power cord is IMPOSSIBLE to find. The product is even more impossible to find, itself... so... basically I wasted my money and ended up HATING this person.. who btw sold it to me WITH her resume."
1,Dead after two months.,"This is likely the last Hewlett Packard printer I'll ever buy. It was sold to me for $100, with a $100 rebate, along with an Apple I bought two months ago, but it turned out not to be worth the effort of mailing in Apple's rebate form (which of course requires half a dozen little pieces of cardboard to be cut out of boxes, a notarized letter from your doctor, five forms of picture ID, etc).This printer worked nicely at first, but two months later it no longer registers as connected by USB. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps in the manual, but nothing helps. I finally gave up on it and tried to uninstall the software, and the uninstaller doesn't even work -- it just locks up and has to be force-quitted.Contrast that with the first HP printer I bought: a LaserJet 6P. After ten years, it has not failed to work once. Clearly, things are not what they once were at HP."
1,Utter crap...,"After only a week of operation, ours stopped feeding paper properly and would only do so with major coaxing and prayer. It will not feed paper properly at all now. I had an earlier model HP PSC that lasted a year before needing replacement, and before that I owned an Epson Photo 700 that lasted nearly 6 years with no problems. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,I LOATHE this printer,"If only I had read these reviews before buying this piece of junk! It worked fine for a few months, but then it started sucking in multiple pieces of paper at a time, jamming and ruining print jobs. Ever since then I've had to feed paper into the machine, one piece at a time, to get it to print. Then there was a whole month where the printer stopped working entirely, because it automatically downloaded an update online and did not install it completely. After deleting the printer and reinstalling it, it STILL didn't work, and only after a month did it finally start working again. Right now it stopped working on me again; this time it's not recognizing print jobs, and the start button is blinking stupidly. I am sick of this unreliable piece of garbage. No matter how cheap it is, NO money is worth this frustration. The only redeeming feature is the scanner, but if you mainly need something to print, avoid it. Don't be suckered into wasting your money on this."
2,wanna feed manually all day?,"If you want to feed the paper manually into this printer, fine - buy it. You will enjoy it. If you want to hit the print button and wait for the finished product to come out while staying at your computer, stay away from it."
2,Good printer because it was free,"We received this printer free with the purchase of a new computer from a department store.While the pictures and text come out fine, it has this weird glitch of always printing a test page when it turns on. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and after hearing so many horror stories from calling hewlett packard's tech support, I've decided to just give up and go buy a new printer. My little epson C66 still works fine for just documents and we found generic cartridges for it to save money.Unless you got this printer for free, don't bother."
1,absolutely awful product,"i see almost every one else despises this product too.1) it is completely unreliable, jamming all the time and picking up too many sheets of paper.2) it prints out a test page every time you turn it on, unless (as hp told me), you follow a ridiculous procedure every time you turn it on or refill a cartridge.3) when it does work it uses a lot of ink, and is expensive to replace.but, hp help desk is friendly, i am always chatting to them, almost on first name basis.Caveat emptor."
1,confounding,"IMPOSSIBLE to use. If you want something simple to set up and fast to respond, buy something else. There are enough detailed reviews of this product so I'll keep it at that. I just wanted to put in my one star rating."
2,The worst printer I have ever had.,It seems to always need ink. It is always printing out test papers. It always jams. It makes a lot of noise moving the paper. It is big and bulky and takes up too much space. In short...I HATE THIS PRINTER.
2,You get what you pay for!,"I should have adhered my own advice -- ""You get what you pay for."" This printer seemed like a good value when we purchased it about a year ago. But it drinks ink like crazy...and we have spent hundreds of dollars in ink alone. I have tried to use off-brand ink cartridges, but the HP software will not recognize them and some will just not work unless it is the official HP brand cartridge. The paper feeder does not always work properly and often takes two or three sheets at a time. I like the copier function and have had no troubles with the scanner. While I'm still using the printer for now, I'm in the market for a new one. And price won't be the guiding factor anymore!"
3,Nice and easy for a non-tech.,"This All- in- one is just right. It's price is great and the copies come out clear and sharp. Paper(s) feeds though with no problems, but I haven't used the scanner as yet. For me this is just superb and I am in no hurry if the speed is not as fast as other models. This suits my purpose.As far as the ink goes I do agree that they can improve on this. It really is not enough ink and it does run out fast.But on the whole it's a fine product."
1,WARNING! - PAPER FEEDING PROBLEMS,"I am so disappointed with this printer. I bought it online because it was very economically priced for an all-in-one that also had the flat bed scanner. If you read the other reviews, all of the problems people are talking about are true! This printer is practically new and after a few weeks (and I hardly used it) I noticed that the darn printer kept giving me errors that it couldn't detect the paper. Very frustrating when you're in a hurry and trying to scan important documents!! I absolutely hate this printer and I'm going to return it and get something completely different. Shame on HP for making such a poor printer..."
1,AWFUL!!! I HATE THIS PRINTER!!!!!!!,"I know, I know, I shouldn't expect much from a printer that was free after a rebate. But seriously, HALF AN HOUR to print a total of 10 pages because the stupid auto feeder wasn't working and couldn't detect the paper? Or it would grab the entire stack at once and jam the printer. I fanned out the papers, manually fed them in one by one, reset the printer numerous times, changed the amount of paper in the feeder, and NOTHING works!!! This is awful. I was screaming in frustration (literally). Soooooo tempted to throw the damn printer out the window, but didn't want the city to sue me for defacing the sidewalk. Actually, this printer makes me wish that Hewlett-Packard would go out of business for even daring to put such a crappy product on the market. Avoid at all costs!"
3,"OK printer, bad scanner","I will not concentrate on the good - the thing works, prints, scans and copies - what more would you want.Here is the bad.1) Installation is inconvenient - slow and takes a lot of disk space.2) The major problem for me is scanning. I archive my old photos, and usually use 600 dpi resolution. With this scanner it is next to impossible - there are visible diagonal lines througout dark and very light areas of the image. They appear whenever you scan with resolution lower than the ""native"" one (1200 dpi). Scanning with 1200 dpi and scaling pictures down is not a good solution because 1 picture 4""x6"" takes 3 to 5 minutes (!!!) to scan.I exchanged the printer, and the new one has the same problem, so it is common for this model."
5,idk what everyone is talking about,"i don't what everyone is talking about. I have had this printer for 5yrs and it still works wonderfully. It is not loud, prints amazingly clear, and is easy to use. It is a really nice printer, set up is easy, customer service is easy and small problems are easy to fix. I use it all the time. Ink isn't so expensive if you buy the refurbish types or refill yourself and i have never had any problems with that. hP printers are great and i just bought another one that i loved right away. The only reason i got rid of this one is because i wanted a wireless printer. This printer has moved more times in five years then any printer should and it has been bumped around, beat up, and subjected to more then an electronic device should and it still works great."
1,Defective product received,"The printer received is defective --- it does NOT handle color printing correctly. Since it is an out-of-date printer, I will use it until I run out of black cartridges, since it is worthless is color mode. I bought it because I had excess cartridges from my recently deceased printer. Given this, I'm not sure about recommending this line of printers in the future."
1,The last HP product I will ever buy,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER. I really don't understand why HP would sell a lemon like this product; if you were to buy this printer, you would never again even consider the HP brand.It has all kinds of paper loading problems. And then, spontanously, it is now saying that I have installed the wrong color ink cartridge (even though I have the cartridge the printer came with, which I hardly ever use, and was working perfectly as recently as a week ago).Get a Brother or a Cannon and save yourself a lot of grief. This printer sucks."
2,Ink guzzler,"I was really surprised to find that I could get an all-in-one printer for such a low price. That's because the people at HP are making up for the price in ink cartridges. I noticed another user mention that if you are printing more than 1000 pages a month it won't work - dream on! I print probably less than 50 pages per ink cartridge. I have paid for this printer 3 times over in ink. While the quality of the printer itself is good for the price, I am going to get a different printer that is more economical with ink - this thing guzzles ink worse than an SUV guzzles gas!"
2,The feeder does not work.,"After only a few uses, the paper feeder stopped working, so now I have to manually feed each sheet at just the right moment or else start all over again. I would not buy this printer again."
3,Worked to a certain point,"Well I've had this printer for close to a year and right now I am not able to copy or scan. When I tried to scan, it would give me a black square I guess the mirror inside was damaged or what not. The printer still works fine for printing out papers but after a few months the other components went out. The good thing about it is the ink is a lot cheaper than most printers"
1,Zero Stars!,"Don't buy this machine. My husband and I have been loyal HP printer customer for years. Only reason I bought a new one was because my new computer only accepts USB and my old HP printer was a parrallel port (that's how long my old HP has been working perfectly, and still is; gave to a friend).I purchased the HP PSC 1510 for my home office thinking adding copy and scanning capabilites would be nice conveniences. I'm on my second one and it's now doing the same thing:doesn't feed paper(regardless of what kind you use to try and please it)no customer service at ""Help"" button-links to ""sales"" web siteno customer service assistance on phoneInk cartridges VERY small....replace constantly and they are expensiveDoes HP make a decent model under $200 anymore? I'm returning this one too. Takes up my whole day fiddling with it.Don't need a fax. Just color printer, occasional copies, and scanner.Shame on HP. gloriadirect@aol.com"
4,Good for the Price,"This is a good all-in-one, especially for the price. Mine seems to print a little slower than other printers I have used. Overall, though, I am satisfied with it. Easy to set up, easy to use."
1,1 teaspoon of ink,"The 1510 has some serious flaws in it. The most serious flaw that I have found is the lack of ink in the cartridges. There is only 5 ml of ink in each cartridge. That is only 1 teaspoon of ink. This means that you will be replacing the cartridges often. And at about $35 for both cartridges, you will quickly spend more on ink than you spent on the printer.By comparison, the cartridges in the HP 1350 hold about 19 ml of ink. Nearly 4 times the amount of ink and the pair of cartridges cost about $40. Save yourself some money and check how much the ink cartridges hold before you buy."
1,Terrible Printer !!!!!,"INK Cartridges very expensive and run out quickly. This is how HP makes their money. Also, Paper feeding system simply does not work. You will have to stand over the printer and manually feed the paper one by one each time you print something.Scanner and HP software that comes with the printer is very good.Do not buy this unless you will only use it as a scanner."
5,Works Great with Mac OS X,"This printer/scanner works flawlessly. The software installed no problemo, and the scan controller is good and simple. The only gripe is that it doesn't tie directly to iPhoto (a ""Scan to iPhoto"" option would be obvious and beneficial). Printing is fast and easy via the normal print dialog box."
1,No More HP,"All printers I've owed have been Hp.I was going to switch this time ,but a friend bought this model and said it worked fine.Well it jams all the time,if the power goes off it prints a new alignment page wasting ink and paper.My last HP was fairly expensive and it only lasted a year,when I get the money I'll upgrade from this cheap piece of junk."
1,"Paper Feed does not work, making it useless","At first we loved this printer. It printed super fast and I love the copy feature. But shortly after we bought it, it started feeding more than one sheet, causing the paper to jam. Now it won't even feed a single sheet of paper. It is utterly useless, a surprise since it is the first HP we've had trouble with."
4,great value for great price,"I had a separate printer and scanner with more money invested. I really appreciate the quickness and the quality that I am receiving on the text and photo prints. Also the copy operaton is very fast,especially since you do not have to go through the computer. The scan operation is also very good for what you have paid."
1,Can I give this a negative review?,This product totally sucks! I have to agree with 100% of the other negative reviews on this product when it comes to the paper feed.One word of advise ... DON'T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!Another word of advise ... Don't use the online chat help function when contacting HP!When the printer first started to fail I had to hand feed the paper. Then after the printer sat for 3-4 months because I was out of ink ... Then once I replaced the ink the paper would not feed at all.After spending two hours online with a tech person he couldn't help. Then I couldn't get any assistance on the phone.I'm now trying to get my money back for the $35.00 I just spent on ink. Wish me luck!
1,Awful,"This printer worked for 2 or 3 months, then the feeder started pulling in multiple pages at a time. This product is crap, and HP should be ashamed. If you want a printer that works, don't buy HP."
1,"nice printer, horrendous software","I was traveling with a laptop with XP. A friend graciously let us use her apartment, including Internet access and an HP printer with a USB cable. We started to check-in online for our flight 90 minutes ago, and connected the USB cable to the laptop, hoping to print within minutes.Ahah, but this is an HP. So you can't just download a driver file of a few Mb and be done within minutes. You have to download 166 Mb of completely useless software. Then install it. After losing 20 minutes in the process, the install procedure is stuck at 18%, apparently doing nothing at all.This reminded me why I will NEVER buy an HP printer again. Their printers are fine. Their software is just the most horrendous bloated thing I have ever seen. This is unacceptable."
2,Frustrating machine,"In addition to all the test pages it prints out, it rarely catches the paper in the paper tray and it eats ink like it's going out of style. It was an inexpensive printer/scanner/copier when I bought it and it has held up over these past few years, but it's not the most elegant, easy to use machine ever made. Once it dies, I will be much more diligent in my printer/scanner/copier buying to avoid making the same mistake."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","This printer worked just fine for one week. Then the paper jams began. HP's technical support person could only suggest that I clean the printer with a damp rag! The printer's performance continued to deteriorate, with frequent paper jams and incorrect ""out of paper"" messages. Also, the printer could not print labels properly -- they were always misaligned and unusable. After a month, the printer stopped working completely as it became completely unable to recognize that there was paper in the paper tray. I called HP and they demanded a credit card number as ""collateral"" before they would honor the warranty. Needless to say, this is the last HP product I will ever purchase."
2,paper feed is horrible,"After just 2 months of minor home printing, this printer started drawing paper from just the right side. It immediatly jammed. repeated attempts to get it to clear were unsuccessful. If you get lucky the first page might go through, buit after that it jams again. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!"
