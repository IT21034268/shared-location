4,Stepping Stones for Life,"This is a must for every person no matter what stage of life they are in or entering into. The steps to Failing Forward offer guidance in mapping out an attitude by which one can be successful. Dr. Maxwell points out that the terms ""mistake"" and ""success"" are similar in meaning with a different attitude focus. Examples of the Stepping Stones were relevant and applicable in tune with the main theme of the book, mistakes are lessons, lessons produce learning, learning maps our direction to achieving our life goals. This book is a must for every family (recommended for parents and children), couples either thinking of getting or are married, managers and employees."
3,more of the same,"If you going to start to read this book, good luck finishing it. It does have some sense, but as any motivational or self help book, the fuel will last you a few weeks. I have read plenty of self help books, the only two books that were ""life changing"" and permanent for my were: ""How to win friends and influence people"" and ""What to say when you talk to yourself""."
2,Broke after a few months,"I ordered this device and it worked just fine at first. Unfortunately, it broke after a few months, so that now, to work, I have to have it held up a certain way with a book behind the tv and if it moves from that spot, it won't work. So I can't really recommend it for any but the most delicate uses."
2,unsure,"I believe this product is ok,it arrived in time.The purpose for the purchase was to link my pc and sony xbr.Unfortunately the TV refused to recognise it and wont stay fixed for too long on my pc.So its just occupying space right now...what do i do with it?Its past product return period i think or i should love to return it."
5,A Very Enjoyable Album,"First off, Saori Yano plays an amazing alto. Her abilities are at quite a high point especially considering her young age. Players of all sorts would love to play like her. If you're looking for an album that's enjoyable to listen to this is it. Her rendition of all charts groove and this is beyond doubt more than just extraordinary playing, it's extraordinary musicians having a blast."
4,A Costa Rican charmer,In January 2011 we took an Roads Scholar tour of Costa Rica. At one of our stops we met the author of this little book and were charmed at his ability to tell story after story. The book was not a dissapointment.
3,Perhaps the only recorded collaboration between Ramsey Lewis and Stevie Wonder!,"What more can I say!?This is probably a bit dated, and something for collectors. But the sound quality was good and there are a few strong cuts. I might have to dust off my vinyl copy tonight."
4,great product for fine hair,"This is a great product for fine hair. Gives lots of body. The only problem, sometimes the spray nozel gets clogged and it comes out in stream rather than a mist. It is easy to get too much and then hair gets droopy. But - if you get the right amount, you hair will look great!"
1,NOT FOR SOMEONE WITH FINE HAIR,"DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR SAME REASONS AS THE AEROGEL THEY HAVE... NO VOLUME FOR THIS VOLUMIZER AND MADE HAIR, VERY DULL.. IN ALL FAIRNESS HAVE TO SAY I HAVE EXTREMELY FINE HAIR BUT OTHER PRODUCTS THAT PROMISES VOLUME WORKED MUCH BETTER"
1,NOT WHAT I WANTED,"I called the company directly because I used their product ""Body Infusion"" and could not locate it anywhere when I ran out. The company assured me that this product replaced what I used to use and is the same product only the packaging is different. It is NOT the same product, it does not perform like the original ""Body Infusion"" that I was looking for and I do not like it at all."
2,"Love their hair spray, but this volumizer not for me.","I have fine, long hair. It needs volumizing, but it has to be a light and dry product so it doesn't weigh down my hair. I bought the Tri Aerogel Hair spray at the same time I bought the volumizer. I adore the hair spray, it is absolutely amazing for my hair type. But the volumizer was too heavy for me. The hair spray works so well, I use it as a volumizer as well as a setting spray. After I purchased it, I realized my hairdresser used it. She couldn't say enough about the hair spray either."
2,Ghoulies 2,"Warning! Before even thinking on purchasing this product read the following. If like me you grew up mostly in the 80's and loved films like these you might be interested to know that this title is cut!!!, and the sound and picture quality are below average at best. This may sound harsh but if you have seen the quality of Fright Night, what was released in the same year and is also a B-Movie you will know what they could have done with this title. Better off buying the video for 2.99."
3,Wonderful Family Movie,"If your father hasn't accidentally taken you to a movie recently, I highly recommend he takes you to see Ghoulies II. Or, as I like to refer to it Ghoulies vs. Carnies. The movie stars no other than ""that guy"" and Oates (my father asked if it was Lionel Richie) as a foppish dandy. Throughout the movie, carnival goers are terrorized by a toilet dwelling ghoulie, what appears to be a flying caelacanth, a bukkake rat ghoulie, and a cat ghoulie with tourette's. At no point do the Rat and Cat Ghoulie fight, they've learned to coexist peacefully despite eachother's shortcomings. The effects are a wonderful display from the geniuses at Thunderbirds, and Rankin and Bass. Everyone go find your Boglins. I know you've got one somewhere."
2,betters up.,"It's get better in the second ""Ghoulie"" movie but still not good.The efects is still very shape,but better than the first one."
4,Fully matured renditions,"Camilo establishes a balanced mix of selections -- thoughtful, leisurely harmonic progressions and heady rapid-fire spins with his usual precision and aplomb."
1,Forever Smoke Free,Forever Smoke Free! Stop Smoking Hypnosis (3 CD Set) [Box set] Absolute waste of my money. Save your money and try something else. These C.D.'s had no effect on my smoking what so ever. You'll be better off wishing on a star...........................
5,The best of mc mario,"Mc Mario, He always take the best song performed by the best person and the mix that he do his the best. I think he did very well with his brand new album. I recommand this album for all the people who like mix."
5,Therapeutic Exercises for Children,"Excellent book for working with children. Fun exercises for children to do as CBT homework. With support from a therapist, this book helps children identify their feelings, thoughts and behaviors in a format that they can understand."
5,Excellent workbook for any CBT child therapist to have!,I have used this workbook with elementary school children to help relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression. It is well spelled out and creative in teaching CBT skills. I've also been able to modify these worksheets for both individuals with autism spectrum disorders and for older children.
2,It's nice if your client can...,"....read at an age appropriate level, can write in small spaces on worksheets, and you are completely clueless on basic CBT intervention.Personally, I found that this workbook was a regurgitation of very simple CBT practice. I was disappointed for the price. As a therapist that goes into the school system, I find the children that normally need my services have trouble reading or writing. Many of the exercises require writing in small spaces or on a few lines. Honestly, this is unrealistic for many of my clientele. I did not find it useful."
5,The definitive account in English on the Chiapas Rebellion.,"The book has all the substance and objectivity of a scholarly work by someone who has done research in Chiapas for over a decade, but unfolds with all the suspense of a good novel. It is the definitive account to date on this very important topic and a significant contribution to the debate on indigenous rights."
4,Very good Harry Bosch,"Have awaited this book for some time and it did not disappoint. Although the ""wrap up"" of the book seemed short and hurried. Not sure of the finale................but, will wait for the next one eagerly...again."
2,A gentle tale but definitely not Pilcher's best,"Rosamund Pilcher writes the most engrossing tales with strongly drawn characters and rich plots, but this is by far her weakest tale. It is certainly entertaining enough in a gentle way, but only as an average romance, and nothing else. Even there it begins to flounder, as I found myself unconvinced of the growing feelings between the characters, and found the ending to be flat and quick, almost as if she had run out of ideas.If you are reading this review, please do not be put off - Pilcher is one of my favourite authors and I would rate all of her other books 4 to 5 stars. Find ""The Shell Seekers"" and be enchanted."
1,Pass!,"I really like Pilcher but this book is... bad, there's no other word. The characters simply don't stand up. We begin with interaction between Selina and her fiancé and right away, we wonder why on earth he should be his fiancé and never get a valid answer.Selina gets on my nerves with her lack of character, her stubbornness, helplesness and lack of personality. George Dyer acts like a jerk. We never get to understand how they can ever become attracted to each other when they're presented to us as both so annoying. Maybe that's the key: they'll make a perfectly annoying pair.An ordinary, clumsily written book that doesn't do any justice to the author of The shell seekers."
3,A Little Too Saccharin for My Tastes,"I expect ""sweet"" stories from this author, but this one is a little too far-fetched, predictable, and sweet for me. A young woman is told her father died in the war. Her mother died when she was an infant. She was raised by a wealthy grandmother and a nanny. She becomes a very proper British young lady. She is engaged to marry her attorney when she spots a picture of an author on the back of a book. She's convinced it is her father. She heads off alone to a small coastal Spanish town to meet this man. I won't tell the rest of the story, but ..."
1,Sleeping Tiger,Received the book in paperback form twice. The order request was to be a hardcover. Sent both paperback to Amazon.
5,Great stuff,I have used this stuff to polish lexan optical windows and it was great. I mounted the part in a lathe and spun it at a low RPM and the results were great.
4,Mens Puma Drifk cats,"Nice shoes good delivery time the first time around, i had to exchange them because the first size i ordered ended up being too small. the exchange took about 14 days but other than that no other problems. (order 1/2 larger than you usually wear for this shoe)."
1,BEWARE!!!,"BEWARE!!! Billy Blanks may have many other good DVDs and videos - this is NOT one of them. By stressing the arm muscles through much of the video, he over strains these muscles and the muscles of the neck. The pain is evident by the grimaces of the participants. Hey, these are all instructors that are in top form! If they can't do it. . . What about the rest of us?The camera tries to pan away from the pain on people's faces; however, it is not successful. Even Billy's front row star Julianna has to bow out for part of this ""mission"" as it is clear that she is in too much pain.Now I know why there are 3 screens of cautions before the program even starts. I could not even watch this entire program - let alone do the workout. A waste of time and money. BEWARE!!!"
5,It worked like a charm,This potty gift box is perfect and I highly recommend it! My niece was having a hard time getting potty trained and I bought her this Potty Gift Box! She adores reading the book...over and over again and was potty trained in no time at all!It's a must for all families!
4,Great Guide to Southern Appalachia,"And I would know, having lived there 25 years before coming to the NW. I hiked, fished, and adored those mountains. This guide captures a really nice comination of ecology, culture, things to see, and describes the mountain ranges well.It's a labor of love, obviously, and I learned much that I did not know while living in Tennessee!Buy this guide if you plan on enjoying these lovely old mountains."
5,A Great Book,"A great book, really good if you only started watching SNL in the last few yaers and would like to know about the earlier years."
1,The 5 Star review are bogus,Read the 1 Star reviews for all the Polgar DVD's. The 5 star reviews are clearly an effort by someone to sell these videos. They appear to be largely cut and paste from a single or couple of reviewers.
5,Great videos,"Enya does very cool music videos. It's wonderful to not only hear her music, but to also see her music. I especially loved the animation. ""Caribbean Blue"" is definately my favorite music video. I hope more videos will be made in the future."
3,"Not super loud, but does the job","I wasn't expecting miracles with this doorbell but for the price I wanted to give it a try. The one thing I would say I don't like about it is that in order to screw the button onto the outside wall you have to take off the cover. However, that loosens up the tightness and now the cover doesn't want to stay tight.The other part I don't like is that the option to change the tunes is on the actually button. Other than that, it works fine and is decent enough to keep for the price."
3,Marginally Helpful,"This is not a very useful study guide. It's definitely not written for leading a group. Most questions are along the lines of ""what did Solomon really mean here?"" Eccesiastes doesn't lend itself to inductive study. You need to be creative around themes that are brought out in the chapter. IV's Lifeguide study is much better."
5,Yummy in my tummy!!,"An amazingly flavorful hard candy, which just like their gummy products, hit the flavor of the real fruit spot on. All of the Kosugai product are very high quality, the flavors are incredibly juicy and true to life, mainly because the actual fruit is a main ingredient, but its not anything like those 'fruit leathers' this is an actual candy, it is the closest thing to eating the actual fruit as it gets in terms of juiciness and flavor. I buy these all the time now, I love all the flavors, particularly the Mangosteen, Lychee, kiwi, and strawberry."
5,Wonderful Lychee flavor,Kasugai makes great hard candies. This is one of the best. Too bad they don't use natural flavor instead of artificial flavor. Musk melon & Green Tea flavors are also outstanding.
1,Wrong Performance!!,"Buyer beware! The set I've received has the wrong performance! GOP has issued a different performance of Il Duca D'Alba than the one supposed to be here, with really poor sound, poor conducting, and a thoroughly second-rate cast. If you're looking for the performance that's supposed to be on these discs, you'll have to get it elsewhere."
2,Absolute massacre of a beloved work of art. Boring to the hilt.,"I have seen quite a few productions of Aida and I am not a opera officionado. So speaking as a layman who loves watching opera this is without doubt the worst production of Aida that I have ever seen. I was at first intrigued because the DVD packet said that it was a ""Zen like"" production. Well guess what? I don't think Zen and grand opera mix well. There is minimal acting which I expected after reading about the Zen stuff but bad acting is something else. The sets, costumes, and in general the whole production was a crashing bore.I will stick to the Met's production (Levine,Domingo, Millo etc) thank you!"
5,it's about time hearing jimmy hall,"if you are not familiar with WET WILLIE, then this disc is not for you. but if you are and can still imagine Jimmy halls' voice sounding as good as 35 years ago then get it and get it NOW. i was not familiar with Tommy or Lloyd, but when you hear this album, you wish 2 things. (1) that there is another cd on the way (2) wish you could see them live. I always loved blue-eyed soul that is why this impresses me so much. ""Midnight to Daylight will take your breath away. Please give us somemore. if anything Jimmy, a solo cd will do."
3,The Band Has Some Fun!,"Tommy Castro is a gifted guitarist with a soulful voice and, in fact, is one of my favorite live performers. However, judging from his last three CD's it appears that Castro is still cashing in on the notoriety brought to him from his Grammy winning ""Right As Rain"" and is becoming content producing cover CD's without any notable original material from Castro. On this CD, Castro joins with Jimmy Hall on the harp and saxophone, Lloyd Jones on guitar, Reese Wynans on B-3, Tommy Shannon on bass and Chris Layton on drums. It is a powerful line up to be sure and certainly one capable of producing more than what is here. Instead, what you get are some R&B morsels like James Brown's ""Good Lovin'"", the Johnny Winter staple ""Be Careful With A Fool"" and the Beatles ""Help"", among others. Overall, this ad hoc band is having a good time working through some soulful tunes coupled with a handful of Lloyd Jones' originals. Not Castro's finest recording but some good music nonetheless."
4,no more foggy mirror!,"I have a small bathroom and the space fills with steam during a shower. This fan took care of that problem.It was easy to install and the motor is very quiet. A note on this...I had some vibration at first between the fan housing and the window jam, but after sliding a small piece of card stock in between--presto! no more noise.It is great to take a shower and still be able to use the mirror when finished."
3,Slight vibration,"I bought 2 Air King 9122 9"" window fans and they vibrate slightly enough to make the windows rattle if they are not closed tightly. The fans seem to be a copy of the old Dayton 9"" window fans, but with a less balanced blade. Other than the slight vibration it is a well designed fan and comes with screws for permanent mounting. The fan is 22"" wide, and my narrow sill window is 20.5"" wide, but I was easily able to saw off 1.5"" on one side, and still leave the sill adjustment slider on the other side. You could cut it down further to 19"" if needed. This fan only has 2 speeds and no thermostat. Even though it says not to use an SCR fan speed control, it still seems to work OK with one, though a variable transformer causes less hum than an SCR control."
4,Quiet Twisted,"Nice fan - really moves a lot of air and at the low speeds it's very quiet. Maybe I missed it, but the reversable part of this fan is not by electric switch, but by twisting the fan on it's axis 180 degrees!Now if you intend to mount it in a window behind a vent, like I did, it means you have to take it down each time to do that. For the price, it's a deal."
3,Good Ghost Story,This version of the Canterville Ghost is a nice update of the WWII version. It's a good famiy movie that won't give the kids nightmares.
3,Feel good family film,"Anything where I get to see Patrick Stewart do Shakespeare is worth watching in my book. Stewart carries this film with his touching portrayal of a haunted soul existing out of guilt from the death of his wife.The story is very melodramatic at times, with more than just a touch of ""after school special"" feel about it in Virginia's clash with her father and step-mother.That being said, however, I do greatly enjoy this movie. It is just plain fun at times. It's not meant to be a psychologically engaging flick, just good, family entertainment. And like I said, Patrick Stewart as the ghost of Hamlet's father is just wonderful."
2,Not as good as expected,"I read the reviews before I bought this. I was expecting a more amusing story. I remember the one on TV with David Niven, which I saw as a kid. I remember that being very funny. I wanted my children to watch it and feel the same way. I was disappointed. I wonder. does anyone know how to get a copy the The Canterville Ghost with David Niven? I have tried and have totally struck out."
5,Worth adding to any video library.,"I love sappy, feel good stories like this. Safe for the whole family to watch without worry of foul language or other adult subject matter."
4,The Cantervile Ghost starring Patrick Stewart,"This version of The Canterville Ghost is the best one I have seen, and I have seen them all. The reason I liked it better than all the other versions is that it really touched me emotionally."
4,The story and Stewart are very good,"This production is enjoyable, as other reviewers have commented. Patrick Stewart is very good in the role as the ghost. The scenery is also very appealing (though I'm a sucker for great English houses). Neve Campbell is adequate in the role of Virgina Otis.However, the other actors, especially the man who plays the father, Hiram are not very talented. The plot is interesting though a bit predictable (though that is not fatal in this instance).Somewhat recommended, primarily for Oscar Wilde's tale, Patrick Steward's action, and the setting."
1,These writers feel that they are smarter than King Solomon?,"I like almost everything Artscroll puts out. This is a major exception. The writers have confused ""commentary"" and ""translation"". I wanted a translation of Song of Songs"". I realize that Song of Songs is considered to be an allegory. Let me see this for myself! Instead, the so-called-translation is just an explaination of the allegory. Allegories can ta taken different ways, let people see this. If Artscroll wanted there to be no doubt as to what the allegory meant, they could have put it in commentary alongside a real translation.King Solomon saw fit to write this as an allegory. Who are the people at ArtScroll to feel they know better?"
1,they stick it to you on shipping,"I read the review on this bamboo fountain and it was given 5 stars. It looked great in the picture, and seemed like a great deal for $9.99. I proceeded to check out to find that I was being charged almost $30.00 dollars for shipping. I tried 5 different sellers, and the shipping remained at $30.00. Thats 3 times the cost of the item! I would respect them more if they just charged $35.00 dollars for the item, and $5.00 for shipping instead of trying to trick the buyer with a seamingly low price, then stick it to you at check out. I changed my mind and decided not to purchase the item. I dont deal with sellers who use these practices."
5,Perfect!,This was my second try at a tabletop fountain whose falling water sounded like falling water. The previous one I bought was too tiny to be audible. This one looks as good as it sounds and is rugged enough to withstand the four cats in my household who will now drink from nothing else. I plan to order another just like it today. Happy to see it is still available.
4,Ballet -- Vibrant and Amusing from the Early 20th Century,"The real Blue Train transported the affluent from Paris to the southern coast of France to vacation in the sun. Few could afford such luxury, like the ""jet set"" of the 1950s and '60s. In her ballet by that name, Nijinska gently poked fun at their pursuits: swimming and sunbathing (in costumes by Chanel, of course), playing golf and tennis, flirting and preening themselves, having affairs, and expressing their jealousies. At the end of the Blue Train, we find a enraged couple in a fight -- except, of course, when lovingly posing for photos, all this to the music of Darius Milhaud.De Falla's Three-Cornered Hat has become an orchestral showpiece of vibrant, Spanish music; Massine matches it, transporting the vigor of Flamingo dance to the ballet stage.The performance of the Paris Opera Ballet is splendid, and the introductory material is both interesting and informative. It is a shame that Kultur only provided stereophonic sound."
4,Gerber Drop Point,"This is actually a decent knife, some work needs to be done on the grind to get aconcave edge , but nice feel, good weight. 4 stars because of the sheath, would prefer a leather sheath. Packaging from rookies was good for this item"
1,This book is terrible,"I was incredulous at the fact that the author had the audacity to dedicate this book to her father after reading her relentlessly cruel caricature of him. Don't read this book unless you want to wallow in the author's self-hatred, for I can so no other reason why she chooses to exude such acerbity and bitterness in describing her family. Sarcasm is a cheap attempt at humor in this book; it's the author's desperate attempt to make herself feel better by ridiculing others."
1,Aliens in America,This book is horrible. It's not funny; it's not enlightening; it's not a literary treasure. I struggled to finish this book. I do not recommend it.
3,There was nothing spectacular--more entertainment and less instruction.,"OK, I admit, I knew what I was ordering. However, I actually thought the girls in the video would actually know what they were talking about. Instead, they were obviously reading verbatim off of cue cards. The girls were hot, especially Paige Hopewell, the short-haired blonde.The formulas were generic. There were no examples to speak of for each type of rule and formula. I can look in my textbook to see the different variations of dy/dx. I guess I was naive enough to believe this disc would be a little more helpful to me, instead of just having tittilation factor. Oh, I'm not complaining about that, don't get me wrong."
4,Who knew?,"Who knew Conway done gospel? Of course, gospel is nothing new in the field of country music and even merits it's own sub-genrewith the likes of Hank Williams and many more doing gospel numbers. However, you just don't think of Conway as doing gospel.This is quite a listenable CD. Of particular interest is the song ""The Third Man"". Loretta Lynn had performed this song on her ""Hymns"" LP (also live on Hee-Haw once), so it does seem a natural that Conway would do it. He is absolutely outstanding on this number.""Clinging To A Saving Hand"" is another reason to buy this. Conway sings this with such conviction that we can hope he was clinging to that Hand when he passed on from this life.Fans of Conway or fans of gospel alike will be pleased with this set."
2,Not even close to effective --,"I usually enjoy ""youth"" coming out storries and self-discovery novels. But, this one really missed the mark. First, on a technical basis - the punctuation and grammar are horrific, and not merely a reflection of a teen-aged narrator, as I first thought. Where are today's proofreaders? Next, the story is confusing and endlessly circular: the characters suffer from perpetual angst, leading nowhere that is discernable. If you make the mistake of reading this, please let me know what you think happens to Kyle. It's beyond me."
5,Music to relax to,"Bradley Joseph's music is smooth and works well for meditation, entertaining, sleeping, and background music for work. Never distracting but peaceful, enjoyable, smooth, and as good as any other pinao soloist. I own Winston, and many others, but inevitably, I end up putting on Bradley. He's my favorite."
5,Played it many many times - over and over again!,"This is one of Bradley Joseph's cd's that I just love so much. I've played it so many times, I'm surprised the CD still plays. The sounds just flow from one to the other and really make a solid piece of continuous beautiful music. It is one of the cd's that I use when I do massage."
2,"A More Timid ...""It's not our fault""","And I suggest anyone reading this take it with a grain of salt.The opening disclaimer of what is and is not ""anti-americanism"" is nice, but definitions coming from Israelis does raise the hairs on the back on my neck since there has been such a concerted effort by some Israelis to seperate American from American. Not to mention the effort to seperate America from every one in the world except...guess who?...Israel.I gave it two stars from being not totally overt in the popular gimmick of ..""everyone hates you and even some Americans hate America but...drum role...it's not because of what you do, it's because your rich and free.If you like your propaganda served straight up, bypass this book...on the other hand if you like served with umbrellas and a cherry on top this is for you."
1,Poor Mastering on Henry Stone Music Version,"Nice funky music, but I recommend avoiding the release by Henry Stone Music USA, Inc. It is a CD-R, not a silver pressed CD. There are no liner notes, just a folded card with cover art. The colors on the CD sticker bleed if they get wet (which I experience trying to clean the finger prints off the CD already present when I opened it.) It has not been mastered and sounds like it came directly from an old vinyl, as it is full of pops, clicks, and hiss throughout. Skip this version and wait for a better record label to master and release this disc."
3,Secrets of the Holy Lance - - the Spear of Destiny n History & Legend by Jerry E. Smith,"An interesting book to read for anybody interested in the history of the Holy Lance and its implications throughout the years and empires ... however, it is a short fall from the two other books bby Ravencroft dealing with the same subject. I found some implications, related as facts, a little off the mark. However, it does make interesting reading --- always good to read what others have to say about the same subject."
1,Poor Book,"There are two types of bad books: poorly written and poorly researched.Unfortunately, Secrets of the Holy Lance by Jerry Smith and George Piccardhas both elements. The Authors did not even bother to check their EuropeanHistory and the result Holy Lance contains several mistakes. According tothe Authors, Austrians called for a union with Germany (Anschluss) and Hitlerhad support within the state (223). This was non-sense because the supportwas minimal because the Majority preferred to preserve the republic.The Bibliography is confined to secondary english sources. Omitted were theGerman and Latin literatures that contained full history or treatment of thesubject. I a^m greatly disappointed by this book. It is not worth the price."
5,love it,I really love this product. it was perfect for my changer topper and most covers fit that I bought for it. one thing is though the picture looks like the changing cover vynil is alwyas flush against its surface but actually it is not. The pastic vinyl is loose and hovers above the surface. No big deal since the cover does the same thing.
5,safe and easy to clean,it comes with straps to secure the pad to dresser and to secure the baby. the surface is easy to clean. we use it everyday.
5,Just what I needed,This is for my daughters baby on the way. I think requiring a number of words is stupid. I may opt out of this.
3,It will work,"We invested in many natural and organic bedding and clothing options - investing in a $100 organic changing table that baby is on for a few seconds felt like too much of a luxury. So, instead, we bought cotton waterproof pads that will sit on this and place baby on that.I appreciate that it's large and fits well on our dresser (we did screw it in so it's secure). I agree with other reviewers that the quilting makes no sense in terms of clean up - I can imagine stuff getting into those grooves and never coming out. I also think it would have been great if the cover was removable given this issue instead of part of the pad. But, overall, it's inexpensive, safe, and will do the job for now."
5,Great changemat,"perfect shape, perfect size, very well made. I highly recommend this mat because of the high sides all around it."
4,Good product but 4th side may not be necessary for some.,"I bought this changing pad for the Carter Manchester changing table (dimensions 36.5"" x19 x 41.75""). It fits perfectly and I've been using this since my baby was a newborn and he is almost 10mo (30"" tall, 23 lbs). I specifically picked this for the 4 sides, thinking it would be extra protection for baby from bumping into the changing table. But now I find that the side that comes up (the 4th side) by his feet, actually gets in the way (for me at least). When I change him I wrap up the diaper and set it by the edge of the feet side until I'm done, then toss it in trash. But the curved shape makes the messy diaper slide down towards my baby, almost making him messy again. Otherwise LA baby makes a good quality pad, I haven't had any tears."
5,Great purchase!! Nice quality and price.,"This is great quality and especially like that it has 4 sides along with the rounded corners. I tried the Carters Super Soft Dot changing cover and did not like how it fit, I would highly recommendAmerican Baby Company Heavenly Soft Minky Dot Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover, White Puff. The contouring is a perfect fit for this pad and comes in white."
5,Great for my back!,My husband and I didn't think that we needed a changing pad since we can just change our little boy on the bed or couch or wherever is convenient but we were so wrong! I decided on this one because of the 4 walls and my son doesn't cry as much when we're changing him and my back doesn't ache as much since we put the pad on our dresser. LOVE! And the price is awesome!
2,I'm not impressed,The guard tends to curl as it's being used and that enables the food to splatter still. It also gathers a lot of condensation and then drips everywhere. It just doesn't get the job done.
5,512MB Cruzer Micro Drive,"I bought this 512MB Micro drive here for price and his rating. True to his word, I received the drive in record time and it functions great. I would recommend this seller to everyone. I look forward to future purchases. Thanks!"
2,"limited reliability, not so much fun","I bought this card more then a year ago. Overall I'm not impressed, and wouldn't buy it again. First of all, in ~30% of cases it crashes my Tungsten E. Secondly, the games are not that much fun. SimCity is EXTREMELY limited and not enjoyable to play at all. Honestly, I have more fun playing games I've downloaded for free. Final annoyance - the card is slimmer then a regular SD so it slides off easily from the slots of the hardcase making it easy to lose"
1,Mostly trial versions...,I have read the reviews here and no one seems to point out that seven of the games are only trial version that need to be paid for again in order to use them more than 15 or thirty days. I was so P!$$&@ when I found this out! One of the reasons I bought the game was because I enjoyed the trial version of shanghai. Of course the version I just got was also a trail so it would not work! The other games seem fine but if I pay for twelve games and NOWHERE does it state that some games are trials I should get twelve games!
3,Not too impressed.,I only like about two of the games on this card. Ricochet is the most intertaining. I am still trying to figure out how to play SimCity.
5,Outstanding! A maserpiece of research and scholarship,"This book is truly one the best books on the topic of military orders of battle. Not only does Rottman present the complete order of battle of the USMC in WWII, but he also discusses the changes in its TOE and the doctrine behind the organization. Not only does he present a detailed OB that covers all land and air units, he also presents a battle by battle OB as well. This book is a must have for serious fans of WWII history, the USMC, and Order of Battle afficianados. This book will be a resource to scholars for generations to come."
5,These Towers Are Great for Individual CDs.,"These are very sturdy and work well stacked up on larger shelves. The compartmentalization makes it easy to start with a few CDs and build a collection as time and interests permit. The dimensions are a bit small for most boxed-set CDs, but these could be stacked on top of the unit when used horizontally."
5,So Simple,I grew up putting together Lionel model train tracks and always found the tracks to be tricky to put together. Bachman train tracks go together so easily my three year old son had no problem putting them together!
5,whoa thats a lotta coffee,"But its what I prefer in my Bialetti, and since this costs $9 in the can at my local grocery store, this is an awesome deal."
3,"Tasty, more like 3.5 stars","Jeremy Pelt is an excellent trumpet player, and Identity is an album of orginal songs with an electronic flavor. Mr. Pelt uses some suble electronic effects on his trumpet in some songs, and there is a lot of electric piano. It's hardly as electronic as Nicholas Payton's ""Sonic Trance"", more in line with Dave Douglas' ""Keystone"". This is a good album, I give it 3.5 stars. If a few of the weaker songs were taken off, it would be a 4 star album on the strength of songs like ""Re-Invention"", ""Suspicion"", ""Scorpio"", and ""Angular"". The overall mood of the album is laid-back, similar to ""Close To My Heart"". Mr. Pelt can play fast, loud, and high with the best of them, but he seems to prefer playing tastier. If you're more curious about Jeremy Pelt, or this album, he has a ton of live downloads on his website."
4,An Entertaining Summer Read,"I am a sucker for court room dramas and although this book kind of by passes that (hint: the title) there is enough legalesse in it that I was held a captive audience of one. I was really grateful I found a book I could read that held my attention. I didn't find the payoff that rewarding, but it was plausible. The characters were fine, not real three dimensional, but enough to be individualized. I will read her other earlier works for sure."
2,Average.,Easy reading. Mostly dialog. Good plot. Starts snappy but gets very draggy until the trial.
2,"""Epilogue"" leaves out some critical pieces","The writing was very readable and I enjoyed the story most of the way through, but there were a couple of problems. A minor problem was that the romantic matchup was not very believable. As a story in the first person, I kind of expected somewhere to get an idea of what the lead character saw in the guy. But the biggest problem is that we were introduced to characters and situations in the book that were never completely resolved. I finished the book feeling very disappointed. I put it down thinking, ""OK, but what about ...?"""
2,A fast read that thoroughly disappointed at the end,"""Motion to Dismiss"" is a fast read with semi-interesting characters. However, though the plot kept going in a singular direction, it appears to me that the author didn't like the direction it was leading and decided to shift gears at the very end. I found it to be utterly unconvincing and everything tied up too neatly."
5,BONE CHILLING TERROR!,Scientist conducting experiments to attack cancer cells instead create living organisms that attack and eat bone. After a badly misshapen body appears the locals call on medical experts to diagnose the threat and soon discover the monsters are everywhere as they divide (like cells) and multiply. Squemish scenes of monsters sucking the bones out of hapless victims makes for great saturday entertainment!
4,No more chicken noodle soup!!,"I have searched high and low for four movies I remember from TV in the 70s and this is the first one I can check off my list. The main memory I have from this movie is that I didn't eat chicken noodle soup for years after - even after I couldn't remember why I couldn't eat it!! I thought I might find it on Netflix but no luck yet! I will add this to my list and continue my search for the other three. If anyone has any leads on movie search sites that are helpful, I would appreciate any help I get."
2,Cheesy,"This is a pretty funny horror movie about cancer cells that grow and then go crazy on an island in the U.K. somewhere. The monsters look like big pieces of rubber hud. They also quiver with rage when they are attacked, anyway Peter Cushing does a good job and the scene where his hand gets whacked off looks pretty realistic considering how old this is."
2,The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust,"The Shoah and the State of Israel is a very important topic. Tom Segev in his book The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust sets out to tackle this sad instance in Jewish History. Even though the book is written extremely well and has an enormous bibliography the book actually fails in adding any new insight to our understanding of the Shoah and Israel. All Segev does is regurgitate conspiracy and fact about this dark moment in History. Segev writes about every conspiracy and critic known about Ben Gurion and the Shoah from the extreme right to the extreme left and also the religious fanatics. What he leaves his reads is a 'mish mash' of stories that are questionable at best. Even though this book is a good intro for anyone who wants the read about the Shoah and Israel it is defiantly not the final word.I recommend you read this book in addition to: The Transfer Agreement, Jews For Sale?, Ben Gurion and the Holocaust, and Perfidy."
2,not coarse milled,"I'm almost certain the canister contains smooth texture Metamucil, instead of the coarse milled, which I specifically wanted."
4,finally translated,"I hope the translation of Schulze's general work on the modern history of Islam will lead to the translation of some of his works, especially on Pan-Islamism. This book has its weaknesses throughout due to the very nature of the enterprise. It's all too easy to point out what such attempts to give comprehensive histories lack. Nonetheless, out of all the books out there, I recommend Schulze's book more than any other because it avoids sensationalism and the essentialization of Islamic history. Moreoever, it presents Islamic history in th idiom of political modenrity rather than in mediaeval throwbacks that are not sufficient for explaining polyvalent nature of modern Islamic history. The translation, however, was poorly edited even after coming out in paperback, which is a shame. Overall, this doesn't detract from the overall quality of the work."
5,Mahalia's music sets your heart and soul afire!,"Each song is an excellent example of the finest gospel music available, new or old. These songs will thrill your soul! Catchy, upbeat, driving lyrics and fine music. Very highly recommended for anyone who appreciates gospel music. Mahalia doesn't just sing the lyrics, Mahalia speaks to you through the lyrics."
1,Why would you use this?,"Why would you use this when there is an organic alternative available? Fiber Harmony smells and tastes better. Works in one dose what Konsyl takes two to do. Also, based on what i've read non-organic fiber is quite heavy in pesticides and fungicides. Support an organic solution - better for you and the environment."
5,The Konsyl moment,"Konsyl was suggested to me in a hospital medical conference by a prominent colon-rectal surgeon in the area who will recommend nothing but Konsyl to his patients. As a surgeon my self who treats much colon cancer and other colo-anal problems, I thought that I would try it. I've used the other well-known laxatives, but have been quite disappointed, as they tended to make one more constipated. Konsyl was much different. I tends to be more tasteless and less palatable than other formulas, but mixes great with either fruit juice or protein drinks. It has become a regular for me. Considering that Americans are plagued by colo-rectal disease, including colon cancer, diverticulosis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, perianal disease including abscesses, hemorrhoids, puritis, etc., etc., all of these are remedied best with at least using Konsyl as a regular diet supplement."
1,stupssssssssss,i was very disappointed when this item arrived and saw that it was a tiny as it was i thought that paid for a bigger size brush ....the only reason i have not sent it back is because i just don't want the dam hassle!!!
4,Denman d14 is the hairbrush for 4a-4b hair,I would give this brush a 4.5 if I could. This brush works well with my 4a-4b hair. The Denman doesn't rip my hair out and it gives my hair a smoothness that a large tooth comb does not. I like to use this hairbrush to help saturate my strands with product. It also allows my hands to relax. I sometimes suffer from carpel tunnel syndrome but the Denman hairbrush doesn't give me the hand pain that using a large tooth comb does.
2,"Best of all the Styx tribute albums so far, but still not good enough!","Nobody can hit Dennis Deyoung's signature high notes. To all artists out there, keep trying........"
5,way away is what got me hooked on yellowcard,"Way Away was in idobi radio's rotation last fall and I was immediately hooked. The song is amazing and the extra video footage is great to see. It's always cool to get a picture of who you're listening to. This single is great, and the album is even better!"
1,Princeton Support is terrible,"I didn't buy this particular model...I have the VL173 17 inch LCD. After only 15 months it started showing a column of vertical banding of pulsing lines. Princeton said that it was the beginning of failure and there was nothing they could do since it was 3 months off warantee. No advice, no offer to help...nada! My fault for buying from Princeton. Never again."
1,Not for Teens,I found the story good but it it too explicit for young teens. They have enough ideas of their own without giving them ideas. This is not a book that any school system should allow. Parents should beware of this book.
5,THIS IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE BOOK. I HIGHLY RECOM. IT!!,THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL WHO GETS PREGNANT AND HAS NO ONE TO TURN TO. HER BOYFRIEND WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER AND HER MOTHER WANTS HER TO GET AN ABORTION. IT SHOWS WHAT IT IS TRULY LIKE TO GO THROUGH LIFE BEING A PREGNANT TEEN. IT WAS A GREAT BOOK AND I RECOMEND IT TO EVERYONE!
4,Great All-Around Watch...,"This is a watch that you can wear at the office or during your off-time. It has the blue face or a mirrored-face, so you can adjust it depending on what you're wearing or how you feel, etc. You can also have it alternate, but this just uses more of the battery.I've gotten dozens of compliments on this watch. The thick leather band just gives it a solid, but classy look and feel. My only complaint is that, when the battery wears out, most places can't/won't replace it (it apparently takes a special tool). Fossil has stores which you can send it to, but this is costly. I eventually went to a jeweler, who managed to replace the battery, though having anyone but Fossil open the case voids the warranty."
4,"""Wow I LOVE your watch!""","This is the typical response from people when they see my watch. I love it! I appreciate the ""clunky"" styling and the nifty color-changing tech. I tend to wear alot of blue so the blue face works great - but if I wear a different color I switch to the mirror face. One small complaint: a few months after getting my watch, the minute hand was off by a few clicks making it hard to tell exactly the time (it is funny how just a few millimeter can do this). But, I was able to send the watch out to be fixed for free. Now, no problems!"
1,Do not use,I tried these to replace my brass automatic actuator and they constantly failed. Tried three separate ones and all did the same. I am back to buying the more expensive ones.
1,not erotic,"The title to this book is very misleading. It implies that the tales will be ""erotic"". They aren't. Some of the stories were interesting, but not not really erotic. As for being ""classics"", several of the stories were obscure, not familiar at all - even though the author gives us background material for each story. I was rather disappointed in this purchase. Sadly, I have no one to blame but myself as I ignored the bad reviews!"
3,Obvious and Not Terribly Erotic Reworkings of Fairy Tales,"I adore fairy tales and erotica, so when I saw this book I bought it immediately. While this collection has riffs on fairy tales that are laden with explicit sex, the stories are not erotic. The style of writing seems to delibrately undercut eroticism and/or distance the reader from it. For example, instead of exploring the potential sexiness of someone with a foot fetish, the story mocks the fetishist and his princess for having a prince with a thing for feet. The retellings of stories are also quite trite and obvious. I got bored with this book, and really had to force myself to finish it. I would not suggest reading this strangely unsexy book."
2,Not what I expected,"I searched around for a book that would be playful and tempting. This title seemed to promise both. But after reading a few stories, they were lacking in both. Yes, there are a few moments in each story that are playful. But I would not classify any of it as erotic. After reading I was always left wanting, and not what I was expecting or hoping for."
1,Nothing erotic about this disappointing book.,"This book was awful! There's nothing in it to arouse, or even titilate the reader. Characters have no clue that they even posess genitalia, and when things happen with that odd part of thier body, they're not sure why. Even orgasms are joyless, and characters don't understand what has happened. Sex is not fun in this book, only confusing. The style is detatched and jumps between modern metaphor and Brothers Grimm styling, which I found disconcerting. I purchased this book expecting a fun and irreverant look at some old classics, maybe some fodder for fantasy, but there was nothing here for me."
1,amateurish and unsexy,"I was very disappointed by these stories - while there is sex added to the stories, it isn't erotic. The idea of Prince Charming masturbating with glass slippers is not just unerotic, it's simply unpleasant. There is also a fair amount of gratuitous spite added as well. Frequent lapses of grammar and usage are a constant irritant. What a shame - such a great concept, but a poor execution."
3,"fine, but not great","Complete Shotokan Karate is a fine book, but it seems to be missing some important elements in terms of focussing on the DOING of karate rather than the sometimes over-mystified beginnings of karate. This lack of focus on fundamentals might also account for mistakes in technique that we can find in some of the photos. The feet are supposed to be rooted at all times for example, except for moments of shifting or rotation. Reilly is picking up his heels in a few of the photos. These are fundamental no-no'sAlso, although martial artists would like to daydream that theirs is a venerable and ancient art traced back directly to medieval samurai that is simply not the case. Modern karate has evolved so radically from what we find in the first baby steps of this art that the two are hard to link together from any technical standpoint.What Rielly is presenting as the complete Shotokan karate is not quite accurate. The karate here in Japan is quite different."
2,Much to be desired,"While the book provides some insight into the inner workings of not only pro-football, but of NFL officiating (the section on the actual duties of each of the 7 man teams is very interesting), whatever value the contents may offer is compromised by very poor writing (occasional awkward and disconnected sentences and paragraphs), a glaring lack of editing (an inordinate number of typo and spelling errors) and a format that is interruptive (relevant and not so relevant quotations are sprinkled throughout the text). The book is only marginally worth the time and cost."
5,Creative Nail Design SolarOil .5oz,"This is the best product out there! Works great! Says to use once a day, but I use it twice. Love the smell."
2,Shop around,"I found similar model from Ikea, Ikea's cabinet is much bigger and cheaper. The quality is ok but really expensive if compared Ikea's cabinet together."
4,Well constructed but . . .,"These are well-constructed boxes, good looking and will probably last a lifetime, with no deterioration in appearance or utility.My only complaint is they represent a compromize for me. I wanted boxes like these but sized so that CDs could be flipped through and selected by their faces, instead of by the title on their hinged edges. In other words, boxes very much like those used in record stores. Those I found that held CDs in that manner appeared designed more for long-term storage or for protection while moving."
4,"bad short Movies on this tape, but some VERY GREAT ONES too","This movie tape is one of the best ever I have seen. not like movies I in Czech Republic not at all. Zitlover is grosse like Toxic Revenger with boils all over. Very funny. Harry Knuckles also funny fighting dusty mummy and the girl who gets spanked is beautiful when she talks Spanish all fast. but the touchingest and most bizarre perhaps is the story of Red's Breakfast. Red is a killer but he is adoring and nice even when he saws off legs of a friend. The friend, who works for Jerry's Architecture Firm, doesn't seem to mind at all because Red is such a great guy. Then Red goes in love with Violet and it is so nice. This movie will make people happy and feel nice-hearted. For these three movies the movie cassette tape is well worth the cost you pay it. Most especially for Red's Breakfast, which is so great."
3,Hooooooooooooo!,"Here's the lowdown: This is a tape containing shorts from the Tromadance film festival. Those not familiar with Troma pictures probably wouldn't have searched for this tape in the first place. Essentially, though, what one must recognize is that o'er the years, Troma has encouraged those with minds so twisted you'd cross the street to avoid eye contact, to put their vision onto film. And o - what visions."
4,"""Best of Tromadance"" shines with new talent","Troma's ""Best of Tromadance"" video is fantastic: A collection of 5 short films from Troma's annual fil m festival in Park City, Utah. All films are worth watching, but ""Red's Breakfast II : Dawn of the Red"" and ""Zitlover"" are standouts. ""Red's Breakfast II"" reminds me of what made all of the early John Waters films great. Dirty,grainy and raw visuals, with charming yet subversive dialog and subject matter. Hilarious. ""zitlover"" is a gross-out short that definately belongs with Troma. I recomend this video to anyone who wants something...""different""."
2,Diss Niss the Bizzno!,"Terrify 'ya, this Troma got the no-slo hoachies, Stumma! Who the fring came up with this garbo? All wrong!But I GOTS to give the prizops to Red Breffiss! RED BREFFFFFFF. Yo, slammonn!Reign Supreme!"
2,It was very confusing.,This book was so hard to get what it was talking about because it kept on mixing things that happened in Mike's past and future. It was very confusing. I think the story doesn't give enough details to let the people understand the story.
2,It was so boring,This book was really boring. I had a hard time reading it. I haven't read any of her other books but I think they're not like this. I think the theme of theis book is good but it doesn't really have any action/suspense.
1,The worst book I've ever read,"It was the worst book I've ever read ,because It caused me a lot of troubles at school ,and it was prety boring ,and it's a govno"
4,"A little dry in content, but I learned how to read French!","I used this book as a textbook for an undergraduate course in Reading French. Not speaking, just reading. Since I already knew Spanish and was familiar with Portuguese, it was not hard for me to understand the language. However, my speaking ability is still non-existent. I just cannot wrap my mouth around French pronunciation.The practices are grouped together very clearly. The vocabulary focuses on technical terms. Therefore, metaphors and literary complexity is not a problem here. Sometimes I wondered if I would ever have the need to describe a steam engine to anyone in French! Our class divided into groups to go over the exercises which were at just the right level for beginners. Several, like me, already knew Spanish. One spoke Italian. One spoke Portuguese, and one spoke German. Others knew English only. We combined our skills to use this book and learned how to read French."
2,Missing pages from this book.,"There are 30 pages missing from this book - I was angry. So I emailed Amazon. The independent vendor eventually gave me a 15% refund.Future buyers watch out for this vendor, don't buy things from him. Amazon should check your vendors carefully."
4,Really enjoyed it!!!,"For me EB&NB; will always be one of the best music to listen to for relaxing and chilling...The ""bohemian"" style is still there, altough powerful song like ""Circle"" or ""What I Am"" are missing... Very good anyway!!!"
4,Deserved More Attention!,"I can think of several ""pop rock"" albums that were inferior to this one but got more attention at the time. I understand that commercial radio doesn't really accommodate this music, but these songs should have been all over college and listener-supported stations. These are very well-crafted songs. I really enjoy Kenny Withrow's guitar tones and the riffs he's come up with, and I like that most of the songs include quality guitar solos. It's great when a song has both catchy elements and grooves where the players can jam a bit. I view this as mature, complete, pop rock, with high-quality composition and musicianship. I'll see them in a heartbeat if they ever come to Philly."
5,Turf Wars a plenty,"One the best books I have ever read with regards to the managing of advertising campaigns within a company. Few other books have provided such an insight into the realities of the pitch process, getting agencies on board, the client/agency relationship and the palava of producing an ad campaign.But where this book truly strikes home is in the laying bare of the internal politics - Agency vs Marketing vs Sales vs Dealers vs Operations (production). Local company vs Off shore Parent. And even more enlightening/entertaining is the strife within each divisional silo.It is set within the Automobile world but the actions and truths to be found are equally applicable to many businesses but especially to the Client/Agency interface. I squirmed when I recognised situations that I have faced as an FMCG marketeer and when things hit home that way you know you are reading a book with true insight."
4,Phillips MoM for skin care,"I am reviewing this item as a topical solution for the control of oily skin (sounds weird, but it works). I apply this to my face after I've put on moisturizer, and though it doesn't keep my face from becoming oily, it keeps it from looking that way. I have to blot less throughout the day, and I notice when I do blot, my blotting paper looks less greasy. I haven't used this as a laxative, but as a shine-control solution for my face it's great."
3,Bought it as a Cosmetic Product,"I bought this to use on my face, as I read on many websites that it prevents your face from looking oily when used under makeup.It works somewhat, but is kind of a hassle to put on. Plus, the milk dries on the edges of the bottle and it is quite a mess.I was trying to save money by not purchasing a primer. I think I will just go ahead and purchase the primer instead."
1,Didn't work for my oily skin,"I wanted this to work for my insanely greasy skin and after reading all the reviews and watching more reviews on youtube I was convinced it would work for me.....nope, didn't do anything. Was still blotting my face at 10am like I always do :("
5,A quality product,"This is a sturdy, great foyer table! It was very easy to assemble which is very important to me.If I could make any changes to it, I would put a different drawer pull on it; I think the one it comes with cheapens it look, and I would offer it in a darker wood as well as the cream color. It is the color I expected, and although I wanted a darker wood I ordered this because of the price.I got this on a great sale and am very, very impressed with the quality. Exactly the size and quality i was looking for."
5,Exactly what I had been looking for!,Great quality at a great price. It was easy to assemble I would recommend this to anyone. Only wish color was a tad lighter.
3,Ok for the price,"The quality of the table could be better but for the price it not too bad. Shipping was fast,and everything was in the box and rather simple to put together."
4,French film noir entry,"A young drug pusher (played by Richard Anconina) befriends a gas station attendant (Coluche) who is fleeing his past into the whiskey bottle. The past he's fleeing so desperately is that he was once a police inspector whose son had died from a drug overdose and wife had left him. When Anconina is killed by hired guns, he goes into action with the help of Anconina's girlfriend (Agnes Soral); he takes on the drug cartels and eventually tracks down the killers and the head drug supplier before being killed himself. Not so much about revenge as about redemption, the movie has a moody film noir atmosphere about it, though the story is somewhat predictable and crudely developed. Coluche and Anconina won French film awards for their performances."

3,"good, but pictures are all b/w",I was really disappointed that almost all the picture plates in the book are black & white. David is one of the greatest painters in history and you can not really appreciate his works in b/w.
2,Did not do the job,"I purchased this product to try to prevent ducks from coming into the grassy area between my fence and the lake in my back yard. For the first day or two, the product seemed to confuse the ducks a bit, but they never left the area and continued to feed on the grass in my back yard. After a week, it was as if I had never sprayed anything (other than the foul smell). Unfortunately, the product did not work for me...perhaps it works better on Geese."
1,Worthless :(,"I bought this hoping to get rid of the geese that's been eating my vegetation and making a mess in my backyard. What it did was - stunk up my yard that I could not enjoy my backyard for days and did NOT get rid of the geese, they were even back the minute I finished using the spray. Not very happy with it :( :( :("
1,Smelly and ineffective,"I applied this stuff twice in a couple of days. It really stinks, and for a while, less geese were eating the grass. But that didn't last long enough to warrant the cost of this spray."
2,Not the Best,"Bought this to defend against flocks of geese that feed on my back lawn. 1st couple of days it seemed to work, but overall it had no lasting effect. :("
1,Worked only for two weeks,"Updated 9/19/2011After two week, the geese came back and grazed my lawn. They don't seem to find anything wrong in taste despite the application. Maybe all the grass blade treated with the Liquid Fence was grown and cut in two weeks. I am going to sow Northen Sea Oats seeds to build natural barrier to water to deter the geese.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -First of all, the product smells like something fermented with a hint of hot spice. It took 2 days for me to say the smell is gone in my lawn. The smell from hose and the shoes lasts 5 days. Due to the smell, you may need to notify your neighbor before you spray this.This product does not chase away the geese instantly. After 5 day from application, They still roam my yard, albait at less numbers. I hope the number will continue to decrease as they learn the grass is not tasty any more.I used all of the one quart hose end spray bottle to treat 20'X150' area."
2,Not Exactly a Health Product,"This is a Gratification product that may effect your health. By consuming this product you are also eating Maltodextrin, Artificial Orange Flavor, Aspartame and ""Yellow 6"". Try switching to a 100% pure Psyllium Husk product."
1,Expensive and melty!,Can't recommend these gels. The two we used partially melted over a 1Kw lamp after about two hours. Also they had stickers stuck to some of them (no idea why) which were a pain to remove before use. Look elsewhere for your lighting gel needs.
5,Phil Urso and Carl Saunders Fill A Jazz Void,"This CD (Phil Urso and Carl Saunders Salute Chet Baker) is the initial offering from the new Jazzed Media label (www.jazzedmedia.com) and holds true to their goal of providing the best in jazz. For those of you who have grown very weary of the current flow of over-produced, uninspired jazz recordings, this recording is for you. Here, tenor sax legend Urso and LA's hottest trumpet player, Saunders, team to present a program of straight-ahead jazz which swings and soars across the limits of musical emotions. This CD makes you remember why you like jazz!"
2,Half cartwheel,"2 1/2Competent but ultimately mediocre modern progressive seems to have lost any potential punch with stunted production leading these semi-good compositions which kick up some dust but ultimately do not go anywhere too satisfying, instead providing a more rock-radio-friendly bridge for those who choose to access the genre that way."
2,Nowhere Near the Best,After being unsatisfied with my SharperImage straightener (see my review) my friend recommended her Hot Tools straightener. Her hair was naturally very curly but very thin so I thought it would be easy for her to use the worst straightener and still get straight hair so I borrowed hers first. I heated it up for about a half hour and turned to the high heat setting. It was hotter than my SharperImage iron but not by much. I tried to straighten my hair (which was thick and wavy at that time) and had no success. It was not much better than my SharperImage iron so i gave it back to her. I also didn't like the hinge design. It was hard to clamp onto hair and the hair kept slipping out of the iron. I would not recommend this.
1,Inadequate protective packing,"This was sent as a gift to my mother. Unfortunately, the first birdbath arrived with a broken edge on the bowl. The return went smoothly, and a replacement arrived promptly, but ALSO had a large chunk broken from the edge of the bowl. I don't know if it is only the protective packing which is inadequate, or if the bowl itself is too weak and would not have stood up over time, or would have broken easily if tipped over. We'll never have a chance to find out, as we are NOT opting to try another replacment!"
1,pure scrap,"1. bolts and nuts were not included..2. paper/plastic over steel...peeling off in big sheets....sent e-mail to get missing hardware,,never got a response..."
5,My Favorite Knife,"I got this knife a few days ago and it's a great knife. It's very light, it has a pocket clip, and it's made of metal so it won't break. There is no play in the blade and it locks tight. It comes very sharp and overall it is a very nice knife. I would recommend it for all ages."
4,Witty dialogue,"Absolutely loved (!) Chapter 13... laughed out loud!This story has unexpected twists, delightful surprises and charming banter - a really great time."
4,Well... I was looking for a little more I guess...,"I was really looking forward to reading this book ever since I read A Matter of Scandal, where Dare and Georgiana first were mentioned. This book wasn't horrible by any means. In fact, it was good, but I guess, after reading A Matter of Scandal, which was wonderful (I would read that entire trilogy first, but if you want to start with A Matter of Scandal, do it.), I was just feeling let down. I guess I didn't think this book had the same warmth and love that some of her previous books did. Georgiana and Tristan had a history starting when Tristan made a bet about kissing Georgie when she was 18. She was in love with him, and then she found out about the bet, which made her hate Tristan. So basically this book is about her plans for revenge, which of course go awry. It is not a great book, but I did enjoy reading it. Read it yourself and see what you think."
4,Good Book,"This books started off a little bit slow for me and there were a few spots that I wished would hurry up a little, but overall it was a really good book. It is the first in a 3 part series and I'm working on book number 2 right now."
2,Not one of her best.,Suzanne Enoch is a great romance author but this book was not one of her best works of literature. She seemed to rush the story and at times I thought the story line was too unbelievable. The last chapters of the book were just downright weird. If you like Suzanne Enoch I would suggest you skip this one and read some of her other works.
5,I loved this book; it had me laughing out loud!,"Yes, Dare was horrid to Georgiana once upon a time, but she never let him apologize either. The result, however, is possibly the most delightful series of put-downs, wisecracks, and barbed reparte that I have ever enjoyed. Dare is a thoroughly delightful man (aside from that one incident) with the most absurd sense of humor. Georgiana gleefully attacks him at every opportunity, often hitting the bull's eye...but it's all to mask the attraction and more that they feel for each other. And when Georgiana decides to get even, they both learn ""lessons in love.""A darn near perfect love story."
3,Not As Great As Her Other Books,"This was not as good as some of her other books and I was somewhat disappointed by the results. Dare seemed to have so much more potential in her other story and I looked forward to reading his ""happy ending"". Well, there is a happy ending but I feel that it was a result of a formula that the author followed instead of her creative talent. For those of you that have not read any stories by this author it will be a pleasant read but for those of you that are familiar with this author and what she is capable of will be a little disappointed in the end result of this story. This story is not a waste of time just not as great as it could have been."
3,Flawed but useful,"Perhaps I underrate Paul Ginsborg. His books are well researched and informative but to my mind he can't keep his leftist sympathies from intruding into his works. I had the same problem with his later work ""Italy and Its Discontents"" HIs style is didactic in the extreme. Instead of letting the facts speak for themselves he usually tells the reader what conclusion he should reach beforehand. He is entirely too forgiving of the Italian Communist leader Togliatti, who as a Stalinist was complicit in mass murder on a vast scale, and while his criticism of the Christian Democrats is often justified, he never recognizes what a disaster a turn to the left would have been for Italy. The book is useful but deeply flawed."
5,30 years and today,"It's amazing, after 30 years and it seems to be made today. It's mad and funny how the story remains actual. Thank you Jules Feiffer."
4,todays degenerating society,the film was made 40years ago.it is more relevant now.you can compare it to PHila. Pa. the acting is very good worth the price.purchased at Amazon.
5,"Why a new one, so soon?","I just saw that on April 10, 07, this great film will be comming out again, and I don`t think there are any additional special features. This is such a great film, I even remember seeing it back in mid June of 71, on a double bill with Midnight Cowboy. Why can`t FOX put out other titles that have never been on DVD before, like; The Flim Flam Man, John Goldfarb Please Come Home, It Happens Every Spring, The Sicilian Clan, & Homeboy, just to name a few."
3,A collection of set pieces,"that left me singularly unengaged. So, the world is going to heck in a handbasket and the characters respond to their situation by howling in the storm, apart from the lead, who has given up. A very able cast each get their chance on stage (and it betrays its stage roots at every turn), and boy do they make the most of it. The female lead's archness was so irritating that it was a positive relief when - well, enough of that. She wasn't alone though: the saliva flowed and the carpet fibres flew freely throughout.It's an odd film, in that it contains some very vivid scenes that stick in the mind, along with many very long, self-indulgently-delivered speeches that bog the story down and leave the viewer wanting it to be over."
1,Frank San Diego CA,"This product did not fit my 97 Honda Civic EX. Asthough Amazon ""Make sure it fits your car"" feature said it did. Do not buy this product for a 97 Honda Civic EX. Waste of money."
4,nice,Very cool and decent price for the novelty but the plastic is a little cheap and metal a little flimsy
5,Given as a gift,I gave this as a christmas gift and he LOVED it!We will be using it this summer so I can'tComment on functionality but looks are great!
4,Nice,"Nice set of BBQ tools. The item took a little while to ship but it was around the holidays. It was shipped loosly in the outer package and the inner plastic package was opened, but the set itself is nice quality."
2,Not Happy,"I bought the Barbecue set for a gift, When I received it pulled it out of the box I felt they looked cheap. I decided to buy a different set. and was happy with the other set."
5,Bears,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend to go with his new grill. It seems really nice, I was really impressed on how fast it arrived. he is gonna LOVE it!."
3,Not exactly as shown....,"I am a Ravens fan and so is my son-in-law. We ordered this for him for Christmas. I especially loved the laser etching of the Ravens logo on the spatula, however, when we received the item, the etching was not that of the Ravens logo, but the ""B"" for Baltimore. I still think he will like it, but I was disappointed it was not as shown in the picture."
2,Not what I expected,"Looks pretty cheaply made, would have just gone and got a stainless steel one if I would have known how the plastic handles would feel. Got for a christmas present for my husband but not sure how long this is going to last for grilling. Wouldn't purchase again."
2,Why the good reviews?,"These are cool as a novelty, but if you try to put them to use, the suck big time. They arent long enough for the grill and you wind up with a cooked hand to add to your BBQ dinner. The handles are crappy plastic and the steel is low grade and easily bends. The spatula is maybe good enough for mini burgers and the fork is useless unless you wanna poke sausages and drain them of their tasty juices. These are awful and I am returning them. For the price, there are REAL set out there that are actually made for a real BBQ man or woman!"
5,Awesome,"I ordered this for Father's Day, my dad and I are huge Giants fans, this was a great gift, great quality! Perfect length for grilling, although dishwasher safe I'll continue to hand wash mine just to make sure they last long!"
5,Satisfied,"Bought this as a gift, my brother in law loved it! Product shipped fast. Would buy from them again. Thanks again"
2,rippoff,i was a little upset when i spent $40 on this and i go to a store and they have it for $10 and the quality was better
3,Too big,"Maybe it was my fault but... while the shirt was nice and exactly what we'd wanted for my son's snack day at school (for a Halloween party), it was two sizes too small. The size chart was misleading to me. I thought I was buying it for a four-year-old going on five. He couldn't wear it at all. :("
3,entertaining,"This cd I think could've been abit better, but its not that bad.I do like some of the tracks on this cd, but over all its just mediocour. a better track selection and would make this cd alot better. the programing is pretty good, aside from the fact that there are'nt enough songs on the cd to make such drastick highs and lows.I really liked the Second Sun - Sonorous track (#6)and most of the songs at then end of the cd.And Tom Slik's - Intergalatic transmissions."
3,Half Good Half Bad,"The album does have quite a lot of very good tracks on it although few are particularly special. On the first CD the good tracks are: Make it clap, lapdance, Ante Up, Infiltrate, Nuttin but a G Thang(quality track), Watch out now, California love(Another quality track) and C.R.E.A.M. However considering that this is an album with 19 tracks on each CD and is supposedly the ""Very Best"" of hip hop this isnt really enough. CD 2's good tracks are, Perfect Gentlemen, Its Tricky 2003, The Crossroads(superb), Hard Knock Life, Who Am I, Ms Jackson, Orange Hill and Shook ones part 2.Overall the album is good, worth a buy if you have spare cash. However if you only have limited funds, don't bother, just download the good tracks off the internet"
5,LET THE SUN SHINE!!!,This is a beautiful piece and well built. I was inspired by a trip to Scotland to put in an english garden which is where this sundial wil go. It comes assembled. It is heavy and sits with stability. I was afraid the price was not a good one but after seeing it I feel it is a good deal. This would enhance any garden/yard. Let the SUN SHINE!!!!
3,Used in MBA program for International Marketing,"We used this book for our International marketing class and did not find the textbook that useful in that it didn't seem that applicable to ""real world"" situations. It also didn't really teach any solid techniques. I did not keep it around as a reference book as I do with some other books."
5,Great Ab workout and fun,"I disagree with the other reviews but maybe that's all to do with where you are in your physical fitness. I have not used bands with this workout and this seems to be the other reviewers main complaint. I do the whole workout without the bands and it is fun, energetic without bouncing all around the house, and it DOES work your abs out. I have used so many different dvd's and this one is definatley my current number one. The day after you do this workout for the first time you will be very achy but within a few days you will be just fine and if your like me you'll want to do it all over again. AAAAA+++++++++"
3,sweaty but a bit one-dimentional,"Even though it's supposed to be concentrated on abs, I still would like a bit more diversity. I didn't think I'd get as much cardio as I got. It makes you puff. Pace is too fast often, I am afraid that contributes to doing it with momentum vs muscles. I wouldn't buy this dvd, there are better ones out there."
3,Tae Bo veteran,I'm been using Billy's products for 6 years and I love them. Using the bands with this product is cumbersome. It takes some getting used to. In fact I tried using the old black bands instead of the elite bands and it was still very cumbersome. The bands showed signs of wear after doing the workout a few times and I'm not sure if the workout caused the wear and tear or if this was an existing condition. In any event today I made some modification to the workout in that I used Billy's amped bar and some ankle weights. Wow the workout was great. The ankle weights really work the abs nicely. You can also try using hand grip weights instead of the amped bar. Based on making adjustments I would recommend the product. If you just want to use the bands then I cannot really recommend the workout. The workout without the use of any equipment would also be a waste of money.
3,GET'S THE JOB DONE,"THESE TARGET'S ARE PAPER THIN, AND I MEAN THIN....THEY SEEM TO HAVE A HARD TIME LAYING FLAT WHEN YOUR SHOOTING IT THEM........HOWEVER........IF YOU USE A CARD BACKING THEY ARE 'GREAT'....EASY TO SEE AND EASY TO SITE IN.......WORTH THE MONEY IF USED PROPERLY."
5,Highly Visible Target,"These types of Red Targets are far easier to sight on through your scope and then view your shots with a spotting scope, than the traditional old black and white targets."
5,Necessary above the intermediate level.,"First you learn basic Spanish, then you master this book. Unlike the French and German entries in this series you MUST know The Spanish information here presented in order to speak the language well.I say this as a student of Spanish for sixteen years, an alumnus of the Universidad de Madrid, and as a Spanish teacher on the university level for nine years. A fallacy pervades the United States that Spanish is an easy language that can be mastered by ""listening to some tapes."" This is one reason that Americans speak the language notoriously badly, with their klunky pronunciation and poor word usage. This book can help prevent your becoming ""un americano feo,"" an ""ugly American.""Remember the motto of the Spanish Academy: Limpio, Fijo, y Da Esplendor. When used skilfully, the language radiates splendor and beauty; when used poorly ... well, let's not dwell on that.Buy the book, study it, enjoy one of the world's great cultured languages."
5,1001 Pitfalls In Spanish,"Very helpful, very useful and easy to understand. Recommended by my Spanish professor. Great study aid."
1,transcriber,"The transcriber automatically rewinds too far when taking your foot off the pedal. You are made to listen to the dictation over again each time your foot leaves the pedal. When trying to fast forward, it goes a set amount each time. You do not have control over when going back or forward just a bit in case of missed dictation. It is such a time waster for a transcriptionist. Do not buy this product."
1,Birdbath looks good but dosen't hold up!!,"I really liked this birdbath when I purchased it because it looked really nice. However, after just a few months of use, the inside of the bowl started to peel. I change the water every day so I hope I noticed that the bowl was peeling before my birds drank some of the paint. I hope I didn't kill any of my birds. So, beware!! Just because it looks good dosen't mean a thing."
1,Astonica 3-Bird Birdbath,"The packaging and quality control of this product is very poor. The item was shipped without any hardware (screws/washers/nuts) and was chipped in places (which I was willing to live with). I called the company to report the missing hardware, and they shipped a box of hardware that was still missing the parts I needed. I called again to report three items still missing. They then sent me another birthbath that was broken in three places but did have the hardware inside I needed to fix the first one. Ridiculous!!"
2,"sturdy, pretty, with a little chipped paint","The bird bath is nice and sturdy, but the paint was chipped on the top of the bath."
1,Poorly prepared & ineffective,"There are a couple of problems with this audio book. The worst problem is that it does not work. The words within the hypnotherapy session refer to low carb instead of specific examples. For example, ""you will prefer low carb foods"" - the problem I have with this is, your unconscious mind would then tell you to go for ""low carb"" instead of celery, green beans, lean meats, etc... It would be more effective if it suggested, ""you will prefer green vegetables and chicken"", ""white bread and potatoes make you feel sick"" etc.....instead of just ""low carb."" Its like this was a ""cookie cutter"" tape and they just changed the words to low carb - very disappointing.The second problem is that the person on the tape has a lisp. The first couple of times listening are not too bad but after a while you really want to choke this guy!I did give this a good run though as I hate throwing away my money. I tried it for two weeks with no effect and then gave up."
5,Working for me!,"I am impressed with this CD, and it is working for me. I think you sometimes click with a voice, the music, etc, and this has been a good CD for me. I do sometimes move it further into the relaxation phase (on my IPOD) since I use it at night and relax quickly. I've tried several such tapes/CDs over the years, and this one is the best."
1,Good sleep aid,It is great for relaxing you and getting one to sleep however ... it had the opposite effect on me ... I gained weight!!! I followed the instructions to a tee. Not too happy!
2,Didnt work,This didnt work for me. Maybe because everytime I turned it on I fell asleep. Good way to fall asleep if you are having trouble. Bad way to lose weight.
4,Operation: Fun!,"These are two good, mind bending, whoa what was that kind of episodes. The special effects were bold for the time., and quite fun to watch.On the DVD, the sound quality is excellent and the picture quality is equally good.Now for the fun stuff: In Operation: Annihilate! Mass insanity has hit planet after planet and no one knows why - and its up to the Enterprise crew to save the galaxy. My only quibble is that if these ""one celled organisims"" were so obvious here on Deneva, how come no one else could have ""picked them up""? It's a little like ""No, we don't have any water but we have starships"" kind of things...And in Catspaw, Ghosts, Voodoo, and witches haunt an away team. My favorite part was when our trio (Kirk, Spock and McCoy) are in chains, Kirk says to McCoy ""Bones"", and we see next to McCoy a skelleton. Someone has a big sense of irony!!!Overall, the great episodes with the superb DVDs, not to mention seeing Checkov for the first time on DVD, makes for a great buy!"
3,My copy skipped,"I am getting the whole Star Trek original series on DVD. even though they are overpriced for what you get. Overall, I have been satisfied with them, but this particular copy started to skip at the end of episode 29. I returned it, and received another copy, which also skipped in the same place. I was satisfied with the content, obviously, and Amazon's service, but for now, I had to skip this episode and move on. I will try to repurchase this disc at a later date, hoping to get a new master. This idea worked for me with Disney's Tarzan which had a similar problem years ago."
1,Only two episodes per DVD?,"I have seen videos of Star Trek with 3 episodes per video plus new introductions by James Doohan(Scotty),George Takei(Sulu) or Walter Koenig(Checkov)discussing the series.Why have Paramount released DVDs with only two episodes?Maximum profit no doubt!I will stick to the videos($19.95)until Paramount eventually re-releases the DVDs with 3 episodes,which I'm sure that they will do as they did with the videos."
4,Mostly amazing,"Very nicely done and well-recorded. As a die-hard Django fan, I personally prefer the hard-driving, raw energy of the nine Trio pieces to the other eight which replace Nous'che and Nonnie (why, I don't know) and add drums, vibes, percussion, horns, etc. Of course, Stochelo is at his usual level of guitar play throughout, ranging from passionate and tasteful to intergalacticly superhuman. But to me his playing just seems to fit the high-energy, Django-esqe swing stuff better than over-produced movie themes. Maybe it's just me -- I also prefer the early, hungry Elvis to the Vegas jumpsuit Elvis."
4,classic Otis Redding,A great collection! Sound is well remastered and there is not a bad song on the cd. This is Otis Reddding at his Best!
5,The title of the CD says it all,"Preety much everything you need from the man, this CD is a must for anyone interested in soul and blues. One of the best from the Stax house."
3,"OK, but not great","There were some good parts in this book,but I am becoming weary of Honor's personal life. A previous reviewer said that things are becoming too cutesy-cliquey around her and her friends, and I agree that there is just way too much ""love"" flowing through this book. I can understand Hamish and Honor having a torrid affair, but the resolution arrived at by Hamish's wife stretches the limits of credibility.I am also growing weary of reading about meetings. The characters in this book spend an awful lot of time in meetings, and I feel as though 300 or so pages of this book consist of the minutes from those meetings. Dull, dry, and boring.Here's hoping the next installment in this series has a plot, and a lot more action. Wait for the paperback version of this book."
3,Hoping for more,"For a serious sci-fi reader, this book is fantastic. I must point out that the ending of this novel left me totally empty. There was no resolution of any kind here. It seemed to take FOREVER for this novel to come out in paperback. I will not put myself through the wait for a sequel even if Weber writes one. I liked the Honorverse but it is now on the bottom of my reading food chain"
5,Great first purchase!!!,"Why?I wouldn't ordinarily encourage a person by a hard cover. But with this hardcover comes a CD with apparently EVERY book that Weber has had published. I mean - if you have never read an Honor Harrington book - this is the one to buy. take out the CD and read the first 5 books and the short stories and then if you still have an interest in the series read the rest, then finnaly this book if you can still hang with the politics.AMAZING amount of stuff on that CD - even the non - Honor Harrington books. WOW! thanks."
2,Dies With A Wimper,"I hope the HH series doesn't end with this book. It's no fit way for a largely great series and character to die. I can read and re-read the first three books with wonderment and total joy but as the series goes on it begins a ""Roman Empire"" slide into self-indulgence that ends with this disappointing dénouement. Weber must be bored by now, or simply burned out. Perhaps, as some others have speculated, the editorial side of the author/publisher relationship was asleep at the switch. In any case, I'll probably buy another installment... if there is one... hoping the fire will return to Weber's writing."
3,"Good, not great","The book is well written, like all Weber books, but Weber's imagination is running low. The whole plot revolves around a misunderstanding: a leader that refuses to talk to another, so, there's a hecatomb. Pretty dumb, sounds more like the stories on CNN. It's the first book in this series where the main story happens because of sheer stupidity, and this cuts the fun. Less action than usual, but the heros are better defined. All in all, an acceptable Honor Harrington book."
3,Disappointing,"A whole lot of words, but not much to say. Will I still buy the next in the series? Absolutely. Dick"
5,wonderful! best honorverse novel to date!,I have read all of the honor harrington books to date and some grabed you from the begininng and others you just had to keep wading thru the story but you knew it would be worth it in the end. This book however is the best so far. A great story line with interesting twists and all I can say to David Weber is write FASTER!
2,Ech,"*****Spoilers*****Very mediocre, overall, and I was disappointed with this latest addition. This probably wont be a very helpful review as my main problem with it has a lot to do with the problems I had with the last book or two in the series.I never particularly liked White Haven - as a character, I find him fairly shallow - and don't sympathize with his cheating on his wife, though quite a lot of time was spent trying to make me 'feel his pain'. Whatever. The relationship developments were tremendously disappointing to me and I hated how Weber worked it all out between the three of them. *shudder*The Honor Harrington that I loved so much in the first few books has become someone that makes me wonder. I barely recognize her at times and I mean that in a bad way.Ah well. Let's just say that by the end I was hoping Haven would get off one good, lucky shot at the planet and accidentally take out White Haven's estates with durn near everyone in it. That would have cheered me up."
4,Too much family life,"Too much family life, but otherwise a great read. I'm not certain HOW much I needed to know about Honor's family life.Also, David really clears the deck, character-wise."
3,Unexpectedly ponderous and slow in places,"I am a David Weber fan and have been reading the Honor Harrington series since the first book appeared. In general the series has been great: exciting and fast paced.Until this book I have always been disappointed to arrive at the end of the book -- I wanted more. Unfortunately, that was not true with 'At All Costs.' The book seems to be at least two hundred pages too long. At over 800 pages, the book frequently goes into details that add little, if anything, to the primary story threads. I actually found myself skimming or skipping parts of the book -- something I have never done in reading any other Weber book.Don't get the wrong idea. I am still entranced by the Honor Harrington saga and will continue to read about her exploits. Weber continues to be among the topmost SF writers, including past as well as present writers. (I've been reading SF for over 50 years; so I've read quite a few SF books.)"
2,not very good,"Well, I have read every David Weber book, and I can say that this is my least favorite series. It is just too convoluted. The stories is kind of hard to believe. If you found out your side had fabricated and forced a war, then why would you launch an all out assault? The reasoning behind this attack is just too unbelievable. There were plenty of ways to prove to the Manticorian that you did not try to assassinate all of their people. So how come nothing was tried?"
2,Now reading At All Costs,"I have begun Weber's 10th novel in the Honor Harrington series. His books are difficult to put down. However, I have become more disenchanted as the stories progress.Different needs and tastes will attract different readers. This reader has loved the military and battle events and accordingly is finding the character development and political events somewhat trivial, extraneous or irrelevant.To use the author's words in one of his stories, they are becoming too long-winded.Te outcome for me, I am afraid to say, is that I am now skipping huge chunks of print.Fortunately, At All Costs has restored my interest; with a better balance between action, characters, and the long-winded political blah blah blah.Excellent stuff. Can't wait for the sequel.Neil HilfordNew Zealand"
3,The Present as future,"As a long time reader of Science Fiction literature, a theme that occurs over and over appears to be present in this latest space opera episode from David Weber. When I look at the events occuring in the present, the Iraq war and the incompetence of the current U.S. administration, I see echoes of this in ""At All Costs"". I would like to see authors stretching their own beliefs about government to include something other than advanced societies with feudal systems of authoritarian governance. For examples that at least question the idea of follower/leader see Ursula K Le Guin."
1,At All Costs,"At All Costs (Honor Harrington Series)I loved these books when they came out and i have read them all. Unfortunately the last two have been very disappointing.The author has followed the logical progression of the character's successes but unfortunately the system wide battles that are now taking place lack emotive feelings. You can no longer identify with the character and her struggles.In the early books, the early combat scenes were detailed and you were eagerly reading each page to see how the character would survive or overcome the treachery of the PEEPs; they are now difficult to understand and almost ramble.I'd like to see a return to the early theme of the books."
4,Gentle Story for Young Children in the Christian Ethic,"This is a nice little story for children growing up in a Christian environment. It is only 20 minutes long. It would easily be suitable for a Sunday School class. I was very surprised because the description does not mention either the length of the movie nor that it was produced by Quadrus Media Ministry, Inc. Fortunately I bought it with a bonus certificate so I only paid the shipping. I say this is fortunate because Christianity is not my religion and I have no personal use for the film. Nevertheless I do think this would be a good film for young children in the proper surroundings."
4,Definately A Great Gift for Any DMB Fan,"Definately a great gift idea for any dave matthews band, to complete a collection or just start one."
4,Shake Down the Stars,"I purchased this book because it had wonderful reviews - the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the intimate scenes - which probably will seem quite tame to most readers. Were women really that loose in the 40's? But the stories of the 3 women were very heart-wrenchingly real. Not filled with earth shattering surprises (but I don't believe the author meant it to be that way) it's still captivating and poignant. How blessed we are to live in a time where everyday is not filled with the threat of bombs being dropped, or loved ones in great numbers not returning home after a days work. I highly recommend it - and just skip through the sex scenes if you're like me - embarrassed to read someone else's private intimacies."
3,not bad...,I don't see any bad or good sigh. I was hoping to see some differences..I guess it is Ok for the price.
4,Multi-Vitamin,"I like these. I think it's a good value, but only has 25% of daily recommended Calcium. Need to supplement that if you want strong bones :)"
1,Not a quality whole food vitamin,"This is not a quality whole food vitamin. In fact I have serious doubts it is a whole food vitamin at all. You can tell by the smell (as well as the taste). I have been taking quality multi's for a long time, and one thing they all have in common is they smell and taste like food. These taste like medicine - not in a good way, and smell like over processed junk. If you know the difference between wheat flour, whole wheat and sprouted wheat then you will know what I am talking about. I only took them for about a week but they did not seem to do anything at all (certainly did not notice any good effects). They only thing I noticed is that when I ran out of my previous vitamins and started taking these I started feeling a little run down after about a week. Could easily be a coincidence, but they sure didn't help. So much for a good mail order vitamin."
5,multivitamin,"I have taken this vitamin for many years. Bought it on line thinking it would be less expensive, which with the taxes+shipping, it wasn't."
2,It makes me tired,"If you read the dosage of each ingredient, it surpasses the recommended daily amount intake. One would think it will make you feel energized but unfortunately for me it just did the opposite. An hour after taking 3 tablets, I just feel sleepy."
1,Disappointed ...........,"Well I have taken these exact same vitamins before, but I had purchased it from a store in San Antonio called Sun Harvest, and it was great. So I saw it on Amazon for a really good price, so I ordered it. The shipping was fast, BUT the vitamins were way lighter in color compared to the original ones I bought at Su Harvest. I did not notice the same affects as the first ones. Its almost as if the were diluted or something. It was as if I wasn't even taking vitamins at all. I'm not sure what store they came from, but I was very disappointed. I knew the price was too good to be true. I'm not buying vitamins from here anymore. I guess its back to Sun Harvest for me."
4,Good vitamines,"Good quality, fast service. Noticed more energy following day 3. Even though probably better than other vits I've tried, even these, taken as suggested, are still too expensive, IMO."
5,Alive Vitamins,"I had used vitamins sold thru health professionals for years. Because of the cost, I began to try over the counter brands and found my energy level was down considerably. When I tried the Alive vitamins, my energy level went back up like it had prior to changing vitamins. If I forget a day, I also notice a change in energy. I highly recommend these vitamins."
5,Meets all my expectations,This product is everything it is claimed to be. A very good description of what the product contains is furnished and the claims of benefits checked out when I independently researched them. It boosts my overall energy and I feel better. I receive the product in a timely manner every time I order from Amazon.
1,Only a 15 day supply for the 90 capsules,"The instructions say to take SIX capsules a day, the capsules are BIG. There are 90 capsules which means this is only a 15 day supply. After these are gone I am going back to my one a day chewable GNC. Not a good deal. The dosage is conveniently (for the seller) left out of the Ad. Will not purchase this product again."
3,Great price but....,"I was happy to find this at the price they offered and I bought it because it said ""easy to swallow tablets"" which was far from the truth. They are what are commonly referred to as horse pills and I had to cut and crush them. I have 2 unopened bottles that I am debating doing that for the next few months. I think companies should show 'actual size' on their products."
2,6 PILLS A DAY??!,I should have read the label closer. Seems like a good product but keep in mind you will have to take SIX pills per day! I little excessive if you ask me. You would have to buy 2 bottles per month for one person! That's 4 bottles a month for my spouse and I. Will not buy again.
2,Lots of synthetic vitamins,"This multivitamin has SOME food based ingredients like wheat grass and other veggies, but the vitamins are synthetic megadoses. Synthetic vitamins may actually do more harm than good. Don't buy it. Not worth the money and neon yellow pee :("
2,Wildcat,"I am not going to go into detail. Yes, the scorching pages were hot and good, thats why I gave it 2 stars. But the storyline was boring, it lacked passion. There is a big difference between passion and lust. The characters did not fight the attraction, which lead to an unstimulating read. Overall I did not consider this a romantic read and I do not recommend this book."
1,Boring excuse for story,"This book about Cat Wilds is a poorly crafted excuse to write sex scenes. I love a good erotic book, but this is just drivel. Cheyenne McCray is usually better than this. I was very disappointed."
4,Nicely done errorica,This was a good readwell writen with good character development. The plot is OK but a little silley as I don't see someone using rustling as a cover for drug smugling. Overall notably better than average for the genra.
4,Very Enjoyable,"I just finished watching this movie and found myself plesantly suprised. The star studded cast did a great job of portraying the effect that freedom of music can have on self esteem, personality, and friendship. I feel that the movie also shows that it is good to stand in the face of adversity. Simplistic in it's storyline, it was easy to watch and heart touching. Bravo!"
3,"Rock 'n' roll film has its flaws, but pulls off enjoyable.","Though the plot was somewhat pedantic and the characterization left something to be desired, I found this movie strangely enjoyable. It doesn't lay it on heavily with things like engaging storyline, but if you're looking for an oddly watchable film on a lazy Saturday, this is just the thing. The film's high point isn't Travolta, though; it's a mostly-unknown named Glenn Quinn (playing Alan), who is definitely worth checking out."
4,Good Movie,"If you want a easy to follow, fun to watch movie, this is it. Travolta and Walters are great, and walters really brings the music to life and makes it seem realistic, like neone could play the way he plays. It was a good movie, and is worth watching"
3,Good beginning,"This is a good introductory book, not so good if you have (like myself) read a great deal of Foucault and have at least a solid grounding in some of his basic concepts."
2,ummm,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
4,"Sharp, Colorful, Awesome Bokeh, Heavy","Sharpness: 9/10Focusing speed: 9/10Focus accuracy: 9/10Bokeh: 9.5/10Color: 9/10Weight: 7/10Construction: 9.5/10Value for Price: 9.5/10Comparable alternatives: not many at this range. The closest one I can think of is the Canon 70-200m f/4, which only goes to 200mm. Overall, this Sigma is a winner and the only problem I have is the weight. But, its an internal focusing lens, so it doesn't grow longer. Build quality is excellent, sharpness and bokeh are OMG. In short, its an excellent lens for the price."
5,A great home design program for the do-it-yourselfers out there,"We got this because we want to design our own house and this works really well for that. It's a fun product and it's really easy to use. You can also get the newsletter from the company after you register and it allows you to download new features all the time (like bathroom fixtures, game room, plants, kitchen layouts, etc). It exceeded our expectations."
4,Something to play with while waiting for new home,"This is a lot of fun to use. You can plot out your entire house exactly, which was surprising. You can put in your furniture (with exact dimensions) and decorate it before you actually buy anything, to see if it will fit. I found this extremely useful and actually saved money by seeing how some of my current furniture would work with the new."
3,ok but very limited,"This product was ok but I was really disappointed by the inadequate graphics available and that this program does so few of the things that they show on the tutorials. If it is this limited they should advertise it as such so it isn't necessary to buy it, reject it and then have to buy the next step up, which I'm reluctant to do because this was wasn't what I expected so I hate to spend more money on the same brand.On the other hand, it is very easy to learn and use if you just want to design some space and don't need good graphics or want to change your terrain from a flat lot."
3,Good service. Fast delivery. Product not that great.,"The cats still have the worms. It seemed like it helped a little bit, but not enough to clear the worms."
4,"If you follow the directions well, it works!","Let me just say that the only time we have had a worm problem while using this product was when we did NOT follow the directions diligently enough. So, in other words, as long as you follow the instructions carefully and don't miss doses, etc., the product really does work! :) Just like antibiotics, right? Same idea. My only complaint, that being said, is how often you have to give them a dose and that I had difficulty administering it because my cats are so darn fussy about what I mix it with and do NOT tolerate just putting it directly into the back of their mouths. Haha. So if you have no problem getting a tiny bit of liquid into your kitty via some goat's milk or wet food would probably be easiest, two to three times a day for a little while... then you should be very satisfied with this product. :)"
3,"helped, but didnt cure her of the worms","Worked pretty good for a natural substance, but she eventually needed prescription meds. But i highly recommend this is if ur waiting to get money for the prescription medication and want to help relieve ur kitty of some of the symptoms until u can take her to the vet. but def take ur cat to the vet, this will not completely get rid of them"
1,Dumb,"The reason why this movie never saw a theatrical release is because it is not funny. I got to see this film for free because I had a friend who was in it, and even then I felt ripped off (not due to money, but the time that was taken away from me). The sketches have been done before or based on sketches that were done funnier by Kids in the Hall, Monty Python, and yes, God forbid, Saturday Night Live. This group got together, slapped a yuk-yuk name to their movie, and didn't provide any substance. Do not be fooled! Just because this group has a different name doesn't mean they are innovative! This movie was a jumbled mess from beginning to end, and if I laughed once, it was due to the fact that it reminded me of when another comedy sketch ensemble did it right!"
1,Floating Heart Silvertone Necklace,Beautiful to start with but quickly lost its shine and lost a stone. I sent it back before I had it a month.
3,Kinda Weak for Freaky Flow,"Man, compared to World Domination, and Keep it Live, this cd is way weak. The sound isn't full enough, it's almost like it was sequenced on a pc. Flipside proves to be getting weaker with the mic, than on the two previous albums.Although FF does spin tight live shows, and even Flipside manages to do a decent job. Unfortunately they don't just release completely live shows."
4,Rita Dove,"I thought that this book was very personal. Her poems stretch way beyond adolescent longing, ... and youthful frustration. Her poems are rich in depth. This was the first of her poetry that I have read. And I got to tell ya, I ain't mad at her."
5,Soothing,AB's music sends chills up your spine once you hear the first note of Mo Betta Luv and he continues to carry your body and soul with his sexy voice throughout the rest of his album. Once exposed you'll be mesmerized by his lyrical and musical fusions.
4,Interesting,"It is quite a challenge to adapt a classic European tale for a cast of characters of African descent, and make the story relevant and even ""believable"" for some of our children who are living in hard-knock communities and environments. The author and illustrator of this ""Jack & the Beanstalk"" seem to accomplish this task by acknowledging some of the unfortunate realities that many of our kids face regularly, such as drunkenness. Designated readers of young children who deal with such issues should find this adaptation of ""Jack..."" to be a welcome addition to their libraries. By the way, the artwork is terrific! The variety of images of the African-descent characters are worth the purchase."
2,Not happy,"I purchased this book for my 3 year old niece. As I read the story, I came across a sentence that gives a reason for the inability of the giant to catch Jack. Get this... it was because the giant was drunk. Yes... they used the word drunk. I was horrified. What kind of thing is that to read to a small child? I know in today's world children will hear about (or maybe even see) someone being intoxicated. Perhaps this was in the original story of Jack and the Beanstalk; I can't say. But I will say that I omitted reading that sentence to my niece, removed the book from her things and put the book in the garbage."
4,Good movie for high school seniors,I would say that this is a great movie from the 1980s for any senior in high school working to the last minute to get accepted into the college of their choice along with some of the pressures along the way. A very good movies that sometimes gets lost in the shuffle of other 1980s teen type movies. Give it a watch!
4,How I Got Into College,"I have this movie on VHS and I am so excited that it is being released on DVD.It's not a brilliant film but one that openly makes you laugh.Anthony Edwards is fantastic as a college recruiter, he is one of the best parts of this movie.This movie is so true to form for those have had struggles getting into the college of their dreams.Lara Flynn Boyle is cute as the popular All-American coed and actually looks normal compared to her anorexic self these days.I suggest that anyone who has a clue about the college admissions process see this movie if only to remember that time in their lives or to prepare for the process in their future.There are also a few others who have bit parts that are great to watch including the late Phil Hartman who is always good for a few laughs."
5,awesome!,"This is just want we wanted. Our daughter is starting college in the fall, and thought she should see this movie. She loved it! It arrived in great time, excellent condition, awesome all the way around."
1,waste of money,"This audio CD edition has 2 CDs about his lectures at Reed College. I was expecting a chapter by chapter history facts like when we read a history book or at least some interesting history stories.It turned out to be a long, boring, irrelevant casual chats like you would hear in some of the college lectures. I am very disappointed."
2,Not hot,"I'm replacing a heating pad that's at least a decade old that got nice and hot. This one is lukewarm! On high (I preheated it for a half hour to be sure) it's kind of warm against my bare skin but no way would it feel warm enough through clothing. Which is completely useless. I know there are restrictions, but this is pathetic!"
1,Really doesn't get hot enough,"I bought this heating pad at the drug store, not being able to find my old favorite one (809-915 model), and it just doesn't get hot enough. The cover is soft and the control is easy to use."
3,Just ok,"It heats up pretty fast, however, it has this plastic smell that bothers me a bit. Will try some other heat pad and will return this one."
1,Not worth a dime.,"Received this as a gift after my old heating pad broke. It doesn't get warm unless it's on it's highest setting, then only barely warm, not hot as you would think it would on it's highest setting. It shuts off after about 15 minutes so it's a pain to keep turning on. I wouldn't recommend at all."
2,stopped working,"This heating pad worked good as far as heat,but only lasted for about 2 years. When it was working, the cover wouldn't stay on, then it started working intermittently after about a year...now it is not working at all, except for the light but no heat. Wouldn't buy sunbeam again. I want something that I don't have to constantly replace."
2,Not what I expected,it is a dry heating bad the descripyion makes it out to be a moist heating pad but its not
5,Just Excellent!!,"In general I do not find myself reviewing management books, but this one really deserves my perfect appreciation. It helped me a lot in developing some basic ideas and adapting them to the cited industries."
5,Just excellent!!,Very nice book! The case studies and approaches are very helpfull to make the link bewtween both strategic management and knowledge management.
3,tomboy,"I'm not big on thai films, but this one was.... good enough. The four main girls are tomboys who search for a medicine that will turn them into guys. Along the way they deal with dwarfs and plump women and some other sutff. I find it cleaver and interesting. I enjoyed as much as i could of it. It has some humor here and there as well so it's worth a look at."
3,"Vampires, India, London and responsibility in morality!","The book might be worth reading if only for the first section set in India. It has all the elements of adventure and horrors to be found on some late night black and white movie. But sadly, the remainder of this book, while interesting at times, fails to deliver the promise of what takes place in the first 75 of 421 pages. His ideas are very interesting and would provoke a lively discussion of many of them. But he cloaks them too deeply in layer after layer of words. Thus reducing the pleasure of the read (which is why we're here) while we remove words from the page like cloaks to be removed after coming inside to a warm room. All this to finally uncover his ideas! Too much work for too little. Yet I must admit that at moments my attention was absorbed. And the authors ability to bring us to India and England of 1888 could not be considered to have been a wasted effort."
2,Unfinished Sycophancy,"The GB version of the book carries the title ""Supping With Panthers"" for some reason. I found the book annoying in its cod-gothic literate style and characters derivative of so many real and fictional literary heroes such as Holmes. The amount of words used in the letters to convince the reader that they are by different writers. The amount of exposition and frankly clunky name drops of Victorian socialites with Stoker running a theatre where Henry Irving and Ellen Terry are playing watched by, on the same night, Oscar Wilde etc becomes frankly, boring. As for Stoker's announcement that he may write a play ""or, who knows, a novel, perhaps?"" about the vampire ""illness"" that the plot centres around; this serves only to place the book at odds with the time it is set, rather than subtley intertwined as was, presumably Holland's desire."
2,Too short,"This feeder is okay, but the pedestal is way too short - the feeder is only at the height of a standard bird bath. This makes for extremely awkward placement, not to mention the poor visual effect. Having two other pedestal feeders, I never imagined anyone would use such a short pedestal - live and learn, I guess. If Lowe's gets their pedestal feeder in the same style, buy that instead - as good a quality, a good total height of five feet and a spiked base to allow for firm seating."
2,What I want in a bird feeder,"I would like a medium size wooden or metal bird feeder that hangs from a tree and is reasonably priced, thought they would br on sale now."
3,minesweepers,This was not what I was under the impresion it was!! I was looking for minesweepers of the naval kind. Not a bad program though!!!
1,Not the Howard McCain movie (i.e. not with Athena Massey),"For some reason Amazon has mixed this up with the 1996 film ""Unspeakable"" aka ""Criminal Pursuit"" aka ""Shadow of a Scream"" (latter is the title of the VHS version that Amazon apparently DOES carry). This one's a totally different Troma slasher film."
1,"Bad beyond belief, it's unspeakable..","What the hell is this bull? I'll tell you... It's un-conceivable, un-believably bad, un-realistic, un-comprehensible, un-smart, un-scary, un-fun, un-necessary, un-official, un-even, un-eventful, un-explained, un-fullfilling, un-forgivable, un-godly, un-needed, un-impressive, un-imaginable, un-imaginative, un-inspired, un-intelligent, un-interesting, un-kind, un-justified, un-likely, un-balanced, un-bearable, un-certain, un-clear, un-common, un-savory, un-ruly, un-natural, ... and of course UN-SPEAKABLE!! Avoid this turkey even on Thanksgiving."
4,"For Some- ""Unwatchable""","Gross, nasty and mean, but Chad Ferrin gets points for putting a video together with a budget he probably could have spent on a pretty good used car or maybe a Hyundai with no frills.The actors compensate for the miniscule budget.Roger Cline keeps a disturbed idiotic look that's believable as he lumbers through his shattered, psychotic life. Timothy Muskatell pulls double duty as a creepy male nurse (aren't they all?) and as a hostile,uptight small-time crimelord credited as Wolf Dangler.If you like entertainment in the vein of Troma's ""Mother's Day"" or WIlliam Lustig's ""Maniac"" series, this is right up your alley. If you're looking for ""Gone with the Wind"", RUN FAST!!"
1,REAL BAD,"Lots of confusion here! Most of the reviewers here are refering to 'The Unspeakable', which came out this year. The 2000 movie, 'Unspeakable' is what I'm reviewing.This is probably one of the worst directed and acted movies I have seen. It is riddled with poor focus(!), horrible framing, and jump cuts (which are ok if used properly). The script should get a little credit, it is a good idea... a pediphile flung into insanity after the death of his daughter & victim, but the writer probably shoulda got someone with skill to direct this one.The DVD itself is full of wonderful oddities taken from other troma movies and godknows where else, if you like weird stuff, check it out. Overall, it is what you expect from Troma, personally, i refuse to sit thru another."
1,Just plain pure crap...,"I am upset, cause I posted a comment on this film LONG AGO and it was NEVER POSTED. Was it perhaps because I wrote a bad review? Was it perhaps that it may have detracted people from purchasing this film? Well, guess what? I'm here to say ONCE AGAIN that UNSPEAKABLE is possibly the worst film EVER MADE. And if it's any consolation, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. I did, and I want my time and money back! Though, one positive note, the extras are decent, and I must say, the director's short film was decent also. But to hell with it, the rest of it belongs in a toilet that hasn't been flushed in months. PERIOD."
1,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,I know that one that played Barry Hell and it is my belief that he could have done a better job if he had just listened to some coaching instructions on acting. It just could have been a great one if things had been different! ! !
5,My kiddos love these!,"I am a waitress and my kiddo customers love these pens. Who doesn't love ""Cars"" though? The pens are bigger than a normal pen, but not so large that they are difficult to write with."
3,Maybe not as bad as I originally thought,"I reviewed this book in 1999, calling it ""Self-Serving Drivel."" I recently went back to re-read it, hoping that I had been naive and dumb at the time and that Barth's stories would improve with the reader's experience. No such luck. It's still self-serving drivel.Maybe at the time it was published this brand of metafiction was revolutionary, but it has not held up well over the intevening years. Some modern metafiction has revealed important, enduring truths about the problems of reading and writing, but Barth's convoluted first steps into the genre read as needlessly complicated tellings of very simple stories.His prose style is certainly unique and evocative, and some of his stories are amazingly inventive (""Ambrose His Mark"" most notably) but as a whole this collection comes off very badly. When he launches off into syntax-less prose poetry he reveals all of his style's weaknesses in exchange for no noticeable strengths. All in all, not very good."
3,"Takes you through a journey like no other, a great trip","Barth is truly a genius. He takes the reader through a labrynith of sorts and keeps you on your toes. If you like a challenge this book provides one. It is original, humorous and fascinating, a journey you don't want to miss."
2,More Self-Serving Drivel from the master,"John Barth is a man obviously enchanted with the sound of his own voice, and to this end he wraps reams of trite observations in ridiculously complex frames. Why he should choose to shroud ideas like ""Are semen sentient and if so do they seek or flee combination with the egg?"" in pages and pages of overblown prose is beyond me. If you are very lonely or have tremendous amounts of spare time, perhaps this book is right for you. Otherwise, get your transcendence elswhere."
2,Not what I bargained for...,"This ring is very flat instead of the domed look it shows in the picture. I was very disappointed and returned the ring, waiting for my refund."
3,Great!,"The condition of the book is quite good, I do not mind, it means for me that another teacher has found it very useful and has read it a lot. The packaging it came in was perfect. Thank you for this.It is a very informative book and I have found it very useful and have made points of reference from it to use withmy students this year.It will suit anyone who wishes to assist young readers in their journey of reading...."
5,Basic Medical Histology,"Kessel's Basic Medical Histology is much more than an overview of the microscopic structure of the human body. Yes, as one should expect, he examines all of the various cell structures, cell types and tissues. The descriptions of the microscopic structure are supported by both diagrams and color photomicrographs. However, the best part of this book is the range of transmission and scanning electron micrographs illustrating the ultrastructure of human cells and cell associations. These figures along with line drawings act as a foundation for the author's discussion of many important physiological processes that occur at the molecular and microscopic levels. This book is a valuable resource for students heading toward a clinical profession and interested in understanding the fundamental physiological activities in the human body."
2,The Shows Are Great But It's NOT Worth the Money!,It amazes me how greedy the producers of this DVD collection are. They managed to spread three 25 minute specials with a few extras over 3 DVDs. How does that rate a [money] price tag? Wait until these fine shows are on TV and tape them or wait until it shows up on Ebay for $10.00. Just don't give these con-artists your money.
5,satiffied,these are childhood favorites and I have grandchildren that enjoy them now! I plan to order more dvds for the holiday season. Im always satisfied with the quality and service I receive from Amazon!
5,Charlie's Holidays,These are the tv shows you remember. Not the bad - strike that - terrible holiday shows that the tv executives are giving us. The original is the best.
5,Holidays with Charlie Brown,I grew up with Charlie Brown in the 70s. Every holiday we would watch it on TV when it came out year after year. Now that I have a young child I wanted to share these fun videos. I recieved this 3 pack in just a short time. It was priced great and it was new.
4,Disneymania,Great price for a set of the classics - didn't care for the 'new' additions to each DVD though just bought them for the older cartoons anyway.
3,"Rating based on the DVD, not the shows","I just got my copy of the boxed set and as we all know, ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" are indispensible classics on the level of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Miracle on 34th Street"", and ""A Christmas Story"". In my opinion, ""A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving"" was kind of mailed in, but you can hardly have the other two without the third.The DVDs are a little lacking though. (...) Why does it take three DVDs to contain six 25-minute cartoons? Especially when there are no special features to speak of. English subtitles are not a feature...give me a director's cut, a music video for ""Linus and Lucy"" or something of the like. They could have gotten away with one DVD for which I still would have paid (the money) for."
5,The Holidays with Peanuts and The Gang,"I was so glad to find the Deluxe Holiday Collection on Amazon.com!!!!! My husband and I have enjoyed the Peanuts Gang for years and the Holidays, especially Christmas never seem complete until we watch them. Thanks for giving us one more thing to be thankful for."
5,Always a classic,from the halloween to the xmas it is always special to watch these as a kid and now I am enjoying/sharing these with my own kids.
5,Awesome Peanuts Collection,We bought this just in time for Halloween and love this collection. Sound and image quality are great. Price point is right on.
4,"A mix of great, good and ok shows","Charley Brown Christmas is absolutely incredible - one of thebest shows of all time.On the other hand 'It's Christmastime, again, Charlie Brown'is merely ok lacking the charm of the first one.'It's the Great Pumpkin' Is pretty good. It shows of some ofthe other characters more. I would gave it a solid 4 star rating.'A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving' is a little of a mess but we doget to see Snoopy, Woodstock and Peppermint Patty a little more.I actually like 'The Mayflower Voyagers' more.I have not watched 'It's Magic, Charlier Brown' yet. I saw itwhen it first aired but can barely remember it. I thought that 'You'reElected, Charlie Brown' fit in better with this set (I own the firstset that include that in place of It's Magic'.That are some new features but I'm not sure they provide much insightto this set. Still, they are nice to have.Picture and sound have been improved a little but won't all that badto begin with.Overall I give this a solid 4 star rating,"
5,Fantastic Addition to Your DVD Collection!,"I bought this box set for my husband, who is a huge Peanuts fan, for Christmas and he absolutely loves it! No one should get through the holidays without watching the Peanuts specials!I hadn't seen these specials for years simply because I kept missing them when they would come on TV, since they're usually only aired once or twice a year. Now they can ben watched at your own leisure. :)I like how the bonus material included extra cartoons, but bonus material is one of the best parts of DVDs so I wish there were more. I love love love making-of featurettes, and that would have been really great to have as a bonus feature on each DVD.Despite the lack of bonus material, this is a great collection for both young and old. :)"
4,That's what it's all about!,"This DVD set includes three classic Peanuts specials and three bonus shorts. While I have viewed all three of the specials, I have only viewed the short ""You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown"". I bought the set for the holiday specials, which were all great. Just the way I remembered them from my younger days! Without a VCR to tape them, my brother and I would be vigilant in making sure we were home to watch these specials. Just to get the specials without the bonus cartoons would make it a great deal. I would have liked to have seen some sort of ""behind the scenes"" or ""the making of.."" as a special feature, but maybe that will come in the future. For the meantime, I will just enjoy the memories."
5,Charlie Brown Holiday Collection,"My grandchildren are just discovering Charlie Brown videos. I thought I would start their collection off with the holiday collection which they thoroughly enjoyed. Since this introduction to the Peanuts gang, they are now familiar with the ""kids"" and are looking forward to more Charlie Brown items."
5,Peanuts Holiday Collection,"Peanuts Hoiday Collection was purchased for my 2 younger nephews, who happen to like the movies. I was thinking of getting a set for myself and daughter. Good movie collection to get if you like the old holiday cartoons."
5,Wonderful!,These movies are so cute and bring back a lot of wonderful memories with my family when I was a child. Now I enjoy them with my children.
5,Perfect!,"Had all of the movies on VHS (not working too well in this world right now) decided to pick them up on blu ray and I couldn't be happier! Excellent image and sound quality with supreme packaging and shipping, couldn't be happier Amazon!"
5,great!!!,"Great!!! This is what I was looking for. I remember watching these classics as a child, and I wanted to share them with my son. The T.V. stations play them, but it's usually 3 to 4 weeks before the holiday, who wants to watch the Christmas show 3 days after stuffing yourself on turkey? Now we can enjoy these great holiday stories on our schedule!"
5,love it,"DVD collection speaks for it's self. Brings me back to my child hood. Even though they are on tv every year you sometimes miss them. Good seller,cam quickly no issues"
3,Just as I remember as a kid,Bought this dvd set to share with my four year old son so he could watch the cartoons I used to watch as a child. We really enjoyed the movies throughout the holiday season. My son loves Snoopy!!! A piece of nostalgia preserved....
5,A Great Classic,"These DVDs are great classics. My son is 2 1/2 and absolutely loves his new Charlie Brown dvds. He watches them just about every day. I couldn't find them in the stores. Then I found them on Amazon.com in a holiday collection, even better!It's a great bargain, and they are just as good as I remember when I was a kid."
2,Great movies; terrible price,"Three 25-minute cartoons for over $...? I've longed for these films to come out on DVD, but the price is way out of line. Five stars for the actual films; they're classics we all love and remember. But save money and rent them or search for a VHS (the quality's the same in this case). It's a shame to see beloved children's programming with a good message fall victim to such blatant price gouging."
5,Great!,My family loves the Peanuts! It had the extra little shows in there too which I didn't realize when I bought it. And the window sticker r on my car! ha! This blue ray and dvd set was worth buying!
5,I love Charlie Brown!,"I've been watching Charlie Brown holiday shows for over 30 years and it wouldn't be the holidays without them. I bought these three movies for some new ""little"" friends who haven't seen them. They love them."
4,A must have!,"While I can pass on the Thanksgiving episode, both ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" are must-haves in my video library.I would have liked to see the image quality brought up to today's standards, however it is still substantially improved over my old VHS tapes.Thank the Lord for Charles Schulz!"
3,had to pay customs!,"Unfortunately, my daughter had an unpleasant surprise upon receiving this item, a Christmas present, at her home in Germany- she had to pay around $8.00 in customs! Next time I'll be sure to try to find US products on Amazon.de."
1,truly dissappointed,The video and sound quality on the dvd is unforgivable. Either these things were damaged in the heat from the ups truck and my money should be refunded or this is just crap.The characters were out of focus and the sound came in and out. My heart breaks every time see it.I feel taken.
5,Not having cable made having this a must!,"I watch these shows on their designated holidays every year, this year I don't have cable and I found this collection. It is perfect and now I never have to worry about missing them when they are on TV! These charming classics made my day."
5,Hooray for Snoopy!,I love the Charlie Brown Christmas Special and Halloween Special and wanted the DVD so I could see the Thanksgiving special for the first time. I was not disappointed! Snoopy looks great on this remastered version. The quality is much better then what airs on cable.
2,peanut's holiday collection DVD set,The content of the DVD's is classic Charlie Brown and adorable however very disappointment with the condition of the dvd cases and packaging...The cases were cracked and in virtually useless condition...this was a new item that was purchased through Amazon. I didn't want to deal with the hassel of returning the item but will be weary of purchasing products on line that are availalbe in stores....
2,one of the DVDs doesnt work,"Everything went fine. I got the Package pretty quick and two of the DVD's works, but Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin doesn't play at all. the dvd players all say that there is no disk in, when I put it in them. Then I noticed at Walmart they have the very same package for $20 only a couple more then what i spent for a used package with one DVD that doesn't work."
5,Downloading the Songs,I just got the Holiday Collection with the three Peanuts Episodes and am happy with everything except for one thing. I cannot find out where on iTunes to download the songs. I can't seem to find the redeem feature on the site. Other than that I really like the set and it is nice to have the extra episodes with the DVD's. I so far have only watched one of the extras and that is the one about the magic. On the Halloween It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown.My only criticism is as I mentioned before the downloading of the songs from iTunes.
4,I like it,"I really, really like it, I love Peanuts and I would have given it five stars if only there were more in them with more extras."
5,Great Classic!,"Great addidtion to your Holiday movie collection, especially if you grew up with it! Thanks for making this into Blu-ray!"
3,A little disappointing,"Love the movies and window clings but the ""snow globe"" was very misleading. It was actually flat and doesn't stand on its own. Would recommend to just purchase moviesf"
5,Timeless,"This collection of Charlie Brown holiday specials is just like I remembered them from my childhood; Good, wholesome, heart-warming family entertainment. Highly recommend to share with your little ones."
2,Only three specials? Where's the rest?,"While I'm as much a fan of the peanut specials as the next guy, here there's only three half-hour specials, which isn't much of a collection. Where's the second Christmas special, Valentine's Day, Easter, even Arbor Day?If ALL the holiday specials were included, I'd snap it up. With just the three everybody's seen a bajillion times already, I'll stick to the library. There were over 30 animated specials produced; why not release them all in one giant collection instead of releasing them in 'collections' of two or three at a time? Sorry, Charlie."
4,Great deal on a great collection,"Every kid should have this set. The Halloween and Christmas video are classics, while the Thanksgiving one is a little less dynamic, how do you do much with Thanksgiving? We go from Halloween to Chistmas decorations here no stops in between for Turkeys or Pilgrim hats. I think there are some good lessons in these allfor kids, plus they are still fun to watch even as an adult all these years later. These have a lot more depth than today's sad batch of cartoons."
5,Peanuts Holiday Collection,"You just can't beat Charlie Brown DVD's! This is a very wholesome, fun movie. It teaches children the true meaning of the holiday season! Great buy. Fun for the entire family."
5,Wonderfull storylines and characters,"Robin Owens never fails to entertain me. I always get so involved I don't want to put her books down, not even on a second or third read."
4,A-Maising Fun,"There are very few videos available for baby/young toddlers that an adult can sit through - this however is one of them. My 11 mos old is mesmirized by this every morning while I fix her breakfast! The music is catchy, the colors are vivid but not overdone with graphics, and simpy stated, it's cute. The episodes all have a positive message and are soothing on the eyes.(PS - I found this in a bargain bin for $2 at Dollar General!!)"
1,Don't waste your money,these screen protectors are horrible. It is nearly impossible to get the air bubbles from them if you get ANY during application. They also make your screen almost unviewable. Do not buy these! Try getting a universal protector from somewhere else.
3,Good but cheap wire set.,The wires fit okay. There is a plastic cap which snaps into place to hold the wires to the coil. Most of these snaps worked. A couple seem very loose. The wires are a little bit long which is better than too short.
3,Misleading Title,"Book was good but not really educational unless you are a widow. Its non-fictional not really educational but a story of a woman who recently lost her husband, is lonely and is having behavioral problems her son."
2,very poetic,"...poetic, but in the most tedious way. I am at a loss...found the story to be compelling, but did not enjoy the writing style at all. it wasn't even what I would consider to be ""challenging"", but more of a distraction to what the author was conveying. needless"
1,A total cop-out,"Anyone interested in a biblical assessment of the ""Toronto"" episode in the Church should NOT read this book. Without doubt this is David Pawson's weakest and unbalanced work to date. He is normally a great biblical scholar and his theology is normally spiritually sound and right on the nose, but this is a cop-out.How he could be so spiritually non-commital in the face of an obvious lie is beyond understanding."
1,Get the PMDVR8 for 8 Devices,I appreciated the heads up on the audio control problem. Get the 8 device remote at Best Buy or here at Amazon. It learned to control my stupid Aiwa reciever that Aiwa refused to give me the remote code for. Aiwa customer service sucks bigtime. BTW. The code was 585. I paid $25 and tax at Best Buy. I am tickled to death with it.
5,The Christmas Box,"This is a wonderful piece of fiction that was written when I was a child. Yet it is so relative to today's children of military families with so many parents deployed. I find my young students can relate to this family in the book and find solace that others go through the same thing they do. Even for those that do not have the military experience, it is a beautiful story. It is a timeless work and I agree with one reviewer that it puts to shame any other book by the same title."
4,a unique surprise,"I was delightfully surprised with this ""book"". While I'm not a real fan of traditional comic-books, this is a horse of a different sweatpad. An intriguing tale of a young lass and the end of innocence, with a positive spin on the strength it takes to move through this modern world of many options and no maps. Uplifting and thought provoking, this meld of art and narrative breaks new ground in storytelling."
4,Prisoner of Second Avenue,Simon is brilliant and again great theatre for community players. The hilarity that is derived from the writing will bring the audience to side splitting laughter.
4,Tosca Kabaivanska/Pavorotti,For me its the best performance I have seen. I also have 2 other performances and they do not come close. Purchased for $3.00 plus shipping. The video is a bit dark and I had to adjust my TV but its still worth it.
2,still waiting for the book!,"i would love to review this book, but i cannot as it never reached me. i am not too happy about it."
4,Handybook for Genealogists 8th Edition,It was everything I expected and it was sent earlier than I expected. We use this book a lot when searching census.
5,Handybook for Genealogist 8th Edition,"A must for anyone in Genealogy!This book has everything you need for all the States, Counties and Townships. It also has when it became a County and where it was originally from."
5,"I loved this play, and it reads wonderfully","This is a talkative piece, but a great one. If there is any play in recent years that can compare, I don't know of it."
2,Six Degrees of Separation,"I am requesting the book (not the play) for this Title. I do know that it was a true story. Cab you help me find this book?Thanks,Wendy"
2,"""Once I was blind...""","My thanks to Mr. Guare. Had he not portrayed the rich as fatuous dupes, I might still envy them."
4,Old school and raw but melodic,"This stuff is near scandinavian sound from 90's. It's raw, occult and melodic (but not wimpy..)."
3,Pressing comb,"I think it's a good product but, it must be used in combination with a flat iron or rollers. Results very on hair texture."
3,lacks pedagogy,"The book has a great practical and market oriented approach however the author makes no effort to help the reader understand the content. Unless you already have considerable practical knowledge about the products covered or unless you go through all the excel sheet examples whilst reading the book, you will probably have a tough time understanding everything. (This is totally unrelated to any sort of maths knowledge, although you'll suffer even more if you do not have a good quant background for some of the chapters on options and vol swaps.) It's a pity, the book could have truly been a great book had the author put more effort in helping the reader. This being said if you invest enough time you will most certainly increase your knowledge base significantly."
4,Practical approach to interest rate derivatives,"Very good for people looking for market practice in the area of plain vanilla interest rate derivatives. Describes market conventions, and valuation approach. I was a bit disappointed when realized, that the second edition which was published long after the crises does not handle the single currency tenor basis swaps issues and impact of collateralization on valuation in depth that is needed for successful implementation. Nevertheless, still very good position, must have, read and understand."
1,Never got the book,"I've order it like 1 and a half ago, it supposed to get here until 24 of Nov but it never did ... got in the tracking package and the last update was registered on 26 of October.... what is this ?"
3,"Good looking, works fine but screen is pointless",Love everything about this fire pit except the lid. Like many other reviewers mine didn't even come close to fitting properly. It will still function and sit on top just fine but the brackets it's meant to sit on won't ever work because the diameter of the lid is smaller than the bucket. Would have given it 5 stars if not for the lid issue.
4,"Clean Lines, good value","Very functional without the clutter of unnecessary structural elements. Lost 1 star because tack welds holding the iron ring and legs together do not appear very substantial, but that is a minor repair if needed."
2,good fire,"holds a good fire for good heat! not so happy with the change of copper coloration after a week of use, yes copper changes but this is uneven, not aesthetically pleasing. It should have legs that lift the pot up higher. This sits too low to be on a wood deck, we placed stone underneath to protect the wood."
1,Shipping Out the Last Broken Item in Inventory!!,"We received this item, shipped in a box which was very manhandled (cardboard was worn and actually had a small perforation in it). Upon opening this box, we discovered that the packing material inside was insufficient to keep the contents from shifting. The fire screen had been perforated by one of the wrought iron legs, and the copper kettle itself had sustained some denting.We returned the product, only to learn that this was the last one. NOW we understand why it must have been in such poor shape!Shame on the vendor for shipping out such a damaged piece of goods!"
4,"Love it, but...","we absolutely love the depth of this firepit and wouldn't trade it for any other. however, the previous reviewers are right about the screen lid not being a perfect fit and i also feel that at this price, it should come with a poker. we have ours on a wood deck and placed a bag of sand in the bottom before using to help protect the bottom and protect our deck. so far so good. thank you cobraco for the beautiful ambience and quality time you've inspired in our backyard."
1,"Poor quality, no cover included","the fire pit looked nice,but for one it didnt come with a cover as promised, secondly, the top grate that covers the fire pit rusted in spots after one night outside with no rain, the grate is cheaply made, and the copper fire pit bowl is thin copper. it isnt worth the 275.00....."
2,"Nice pen, but doesn't work on my tablet","I've been in dire need for a new pen for my HP Slate 500 trying just about every pen on amazon. This one did not work for the HP Slate 500. However, this pen did have a nice feel to it."
4,Grantville,"First time I read this anthology. Very enjoyable to read. For people who like reading alternate history stories it is good to read, but they need to have read at least 1632 to be able to grasp some of the background to these stories"
3,Does Not Add Much to the Franchise,"This collection of stories from the RING OF FIRE franchise does not add too much value to the franchise. It is a collection of shorts plus a couple of ""fact"" articles set in the 163n framework. They hold together just fine as far as fitting into the framework but they are not all that entertaining in their own rights. That is a problem.Often enough, the stories read well, they just don't come to any sort of a satisfying conclusion. One is left with the feeling, ""so what?"" This is true for the little known authors as well as for Eric Flint, the originator. They are not awful, they just are not all that good.Even so, the series interests me enough that I will continue to buy and read it. I just hope for something better next time."
3,Fills in gaps in the saga of 1632,"As can be expected in an anthology the writing quality varies greatly. There are some funny pieces in here though and it does help to fill out some of the details left out of other 1632 books. While I'm sure some people will be fascinated by the trials and tribulations of creating a modern medical school in 1600s Germany it just wasn't my cup of tea, but the story about the rescue of a Moghul ambassador makes up for it."
1,50% more expensive than buying at your local drugstore,"After ordering the 114-tablespoon version of this product, I stopped in to my local CVS and saw it being sold for $12.80. Oh well, live and learn."
4,drink quickly dont let it sit,"Aparrently the other reviewer let that glass od metamucil sit too long. I find that if i stir it and drink it down immediatly. It does not jell up and get all gross. I did let it sit for a couple minutes one time and it was, as that reviewer said like drinking jello....real disgusting. But just drink immediatly and the texture is not much different than water. And the orange taste, i think is not bad at all."
3,Too Much Sugar..,"This product contains way too much sugar for me. I just compared Metamucil (48.2 Oz Container) to Benefiber (18.7 Oz Container), and found the following:With Metamucil you get 114 servings per container.Serving Size: 12g (One rounded Tbsp)Calories Per Serving: 45Total Carb: 12gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 2gSugars: 9gIron: 0.8mgSodium: 5mgPotassium: 30With Benefiber you get 115 servings per container.Serving Size: 4.6g (Two Tsp)Calories Per Serving: 15Sodium: 0gTotal Carb: 4gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 3gSugar: 0gMetamucil is tasty but it gets too thick to drink if not consumed immediately. Benefiber is a little more expensive, but at least I'm not paying for sugar and putting on weight from the empty calories.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
2,Price Rising Rapidly,"I can't believe how Amazon has raised the price on this. Last December it was $11.63, in Feb. it 3was $14.99, now $21.33! GET IT AT YOUR LOCAL STORE OR ANY PLACE ELSE TO AVOID THIS GOUGING! The Metamucil Smooth Texture Orange product is fine. Works as always. I don't have a problem with the item at all."
1,Horrible,I have used the original with no problems. This orange stuff should be advertised as a cure for diarrhea. I needed to take it short term with meds and I have been totally constipated the whole time. I followed directions. I will never use this prodect again because I will never put myself through the discomfort and actual pain again. It has been absolute hell.
2,Ehh.,"Was not able to test the effectiveness of this product, as the texture was just too unbearable for me. I tried it once mixing it with water, and it became very jello-like, with only a faint orange taste. Not a fan, so I had to throw out the rest.I think I would stick with metamucil pills."
3,Metamucil in the mail!,"This is just a sugary fiber supplement used to treat chronic IBS, constipation, diarrhea. The way Metamucil works is that it's all soluble fiber that takes water out of the stool as well as stimulating the bowels. The product namely prevents cholesterol and promotes good heart health. One thing to note is that taste and texture of the product may not be to your liking as it's unconventional, and may taste odd. The better way to go about Metamucil in my experience is just take the hit and go with the flavorless brand as it doesn't have as many additives and sugar compounds. Flavorless Metamucil is for people who want to exceed in their health and can support the few additives found in Metamucil itself.The healthier alternative will always be pure organic fiber supplements such as pure psyllium husk."
2,not sure was sent the correct part,"The solenoid fitted correctly, in fact, it was like installing a light bulb.When I tested it, it wouldn't turn on the waterflow. I got the waterflow to work and, when testing, I was able to make it shut off but not turn on again.One day, coming home in the evening, the sprinklers were going. The solenoid must have gone off by itself. I could not shut it down using the timer so I finally shut off the supply valve to the system.When I removed the solenoid, I saw that the plunger was not sticking out as shown in the image.Perhaps the spring was defective. There was no ""Orbit"" brand on the packaging or a slip inside with the part reference but, as this is a replacement part, the packaging might not necessarily have the logo on it.Will try getting a new one and see if that works.I would recommend comparing the product closely against images both the Amazon one and additional images from the manufacturer and other retailers before even opening the container."
3,Bird songs galore,"The DVD provided an image or images of the bird whose call we were hearing. Sometimes photos only, sometimes actual video of the bird. A woman described the call and imitated it, in human terms. She was excellent. First we just started the DVD and for an hour were treated to innumerable bird calls, from all over. Since we were trying to learn birdcalls, it was overwhelming. Then we discovered that there was an alphabetical index and we could choose which bird to hear.I would have liked to see a better format where birds were grouped by family, perhaps, and a bit more information provided; like migration paths, mating habits and how the families developed and when the chicks went out on their own, for example. Perhaps there's another video that does just that.But Birds Birds Birds is the first bird call DVD we ever heard or purchased. Holly/Brooklyn"
4,Any birder will love this DVD,"Birds, Birds, Birds! isn't really a film or a documentary, per se, because it doesn't have a narrative storyline. Instead it's a fascinating, well-made guide to a wide range of common North American birds, with excellent footage and sound recordings for each. As eye- and ear-training for birders, it's great, and for just general enjoyment, it's a treat for all bird-lovers. Personally I liked it better with the spoken soundtrack turned off, because the actress who was voicing the birdcall mneumonics was trying a little too hard to put interest into her line readings, to the point that sometimes the way she enunciated the phrase didn't show any similarity to the bird call in question. But that's just me.The photography and video footage on this DVD are excellent, the recordings are top-notch, and it's a terrific way to either work on your call recognition for a birding trip, or just to relax and enjoy the beauty and songs of the feathered ones. I give it four solid stars."
5,Great for teaching high school ornithology,It's been great for teaching a high school level bird watching class in the middle of winter before the birds get to the North East. Great preparation.
3,Birds singing to Birds.,I enjoy the birds on this DVD. Sounds are fine. I play it for my finches to listen to; they enjoy it.
2,No Captions or Music!,"Very disappointed in this product, especially considering its price. The pictures of birds, furthermore, were static rather than in motion. Sometimes it was hard to hear the narrator pronounce the names so captions are, quite frankly, essential, but even more so because this was a gift for my father who's hard of hearing anyway. It would have been so easy for the producers to have added the captions, too (both common and scientific names, preferably)--and even soothing music in the background to accompany the pictures of the birds. Buyers should be forewarned."
1,"Birds, Birds, Birds! An Indoor Birdwatching Field Trip","I was very disappointed in this DVD. It was a DVD for someone who wanted only the very basic information on birds. The DVD was very short and could have added a lot of expanded details. The ability to view details of color and details of wing, tail bands, etc would have offered a much better learning tool. It also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations."
2,Cat's impression,"Bought this for my kitty. The first time I played it she was interested, but the second time and subsequent times she's not been interested at all. She knows they aren't real. There are too many indiscrepancies: sound coming from speakers, no movement, etc.The video itself would be a lot better for cats if:(a) all scenes had motion; a lot are stills(b) you could turn off the human ""commentary"" (distracting)(c) all scenes were at least 60 seconds in length; most of these are very short (10-15sec)In summary Kitty would have been a lot happier if I had spent the money on a small bird at the pet shop and brought it home for her to kill."
2,Disappointed,"Unless you are an avid bird watcher and need resource material for north american bird sounds, this DVD is otherwise a waste of money. Spend the extra money and buy ""the Life of Birds""."
5,Great Deal!,I have had this item for quite some time now and I am impressed with it's quality. I honestly did not think it would last this long. I have ran over 1000 tags through it and it keeps going strong. What a great product.
2,Not good quality,"I used it to tag a few items I wanted to sale and, after using it for about 10 times, it started to jam ...it wont stop doing it. Not built to last, that is for sure. If you are going to use it often, I think you should spend a little more for a better quality item."
3,Works well,"The product works well and I was happy with that, my only problem was that the picture shows a purple gun and I specifically bought this one over others because it was purple. But when I received my item it was red and yellow. Not at all what I was expecting terms of color."
1,Did not work for me,I bought this product in May and gave up on tagging guns as I became very frustrated with trying to work this one. The needle was very large and left marks on the fabric. The trigger did not work very well and could not push the fastener pin. The kit was cheap and I guess you get what you paid for.
4,Good Product,This is a good product for the money and it was very easy to use. The only thing I didn't like about it was the size of the needles. I had to be real careful not to put holes in cloths. All in all it was a good buy.
1,Unsatisfied,"The gun worked okay until it jammed. I tried to fix it and the only way to do that was to take it apart and then the whole thing fell apart! Just frustrating, because I dont have the toime to deal with it."
3,decent gun for lite use,"this isn't a heavy duty tagging gun by any means. it is meant for lite use. i purchased this option because it came with all the tags i could ever need or want. no need to purchase the gun and tags separately. the plastic gun isnt the best quality, but it will sufice for my basic needs."
1,You get what you pay for,"I read all the reviews before I purchased this tag gun. I knew it was a risk. Just as everyone suggested, I handled the gun with kit gloves. It fell apart in my hands after only 10 tags. There was no way to put it back togather, so I got in the car and drove to Michael's. That one is still working............."
3,Really liked it at first!,"I really liked this tagging gun. It was quick and easy tagging, but after tagging about 40 items over 3 months, it died.I'll buy another one, but maybe a better brand this time. Always remember, you get what you pay for!"
5,Perfect for what my wife needed.,"My wife has degenerative disc disease and cannot pickup anything heavy or even something lighter any length of time. She does water aerobic therapy at the gym and basically carries her workout bag with everything she requires to shower, dry off and get ready for her day. In other words, her bag weighs quite a bit. I purchased this to help with transporting her bag to and from the parking lot. She loves the friendly telescoping handle and how light it is. I'm not too sure about the listed weight capacity, but it does the job for what we needed."
3,"Helpful guide, but not on par with it's companion","Engle's handbook on Christian congregational worship, like his handbook on wedding services, is a useful, eclectic tool. Various denominational, and non-denominational styles are covered.However, the variety covered here, considering the briefness of the volume, decreases it's usefulness. Where a collection of styles is quite usefull in a wedding handbook, due to the increase in inter- and non-denominational marriages, in a worship handbook, it simply makes the material covered seem watered down.I recommend that one either look for a book within one's tradition, or find a volume that surveys aspects of congregational worship in more depth. For those who lean toward, or are interested in the Reformed tradition, I highly recommend books by Hughes Oliphant Old, especially his book, Leading in Prayer. That book greatly changed the way I saw the entire worship service."
5,For a Healthier life!!!!,"Me and all my family take this Papaya Enzimes, i feel safe by protecting their digestive health. I love this brand ""Natural Factors"" and the price is excellent!"
3,it's just ok,"A good ""basic"" introduction on how to navigate through all the menu selections and setup and adjust all the features this fishfinder has to offer. Was hoping for an intro about reading/understanding the graphs, but it provides nothing along those lines."
2,I was looking for a multi. device with a Advanced DVD and it would work Blue Ray and no one has for my NB500MGX A,The codes are not in this remote for any type of Blue Ray that stupid its a 2009 model im sure its lovely for DVD players
4,Sprinkler base,This is simply a replacement base for lawn and garden sprinklers. It works! The only qestions is will it break. I am using it as a replacement for one that did. Time will tell.
3,"Aesthetically pleasing, but not traditional.....","This is a difficult deck for beginners. The art is evocative, but there is little traditional symbolism here. I am confused at the artist's interpretation of the 2 of Swords as ""Peace""; and perhaps switching the images of the Empress and Princess of Disks cards would have made more sense.Clearly, the artist is wishing to impart to us that sex is a divinely sanctioned act, not to be confused with our lower urges. As this seems to be a main theme, I would not recommend this deck for anyone with sensitivity to the artistic rendering of genitalia.Overall, this is a fascinating deck, and one that encourages readers to use the Tarot intuitively. To fully appreciate the artist's intent behind each image, I recommend purchasing the companion book."
1,Insane,"There is no tarot deck on earth that is worth $300.00. If you pay that kind of money for this deck or the book that goes with it, you need your head examined."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,This is more a history of Mr. Bunyan. I was hoping for a collction of stories. Stories that I read when I was young weren't even mentioned or were alluded to as some sort of historical footnote without any of the details that made them great stories.
4,Great Product!,"Bought this for my 6 year old gaming/tv freak, very sturdy construction with no worries of tipping the 27 inch tv. Currently we have a DVD/VCR combo on the second shelf and a GameCube on the bottom. The only problem we have had is the spacing slats that hold the DVD's in place don't hold them tightly enough and they sometimes fall off of the stand. Easy to put together and even easier to keep clean."
5,good,"este disco me gusto porque es variado incluye bachatas, merengues y una balada aunque no es como sus discos anteriores donde el merengue era mas agresivo si eres un fanatico te gustara especialmente ( solo una noche, dile a el, por que sin ti y la paga)eso no quiere decir que las demas canciones no sean buenas la unica que no me gusta es la ultima que es una balada."
4,GOOD ALBUM,"This is a good album, but there is one thing preventing it from being a great album, and thats the lack of kick ass merengue.Unlikely like his first album ""Caminando,"" which was the best merengue album of 1999, he drifts of to other genras that really dont compliment his voice. Dont get me wrong, I think the two bachatas he did on the album were great, but I am not to fond of his ballad rendition at the end of the album. Best song, ""Dile A El,"" in this song I got a taste of what Tun Tun used to be on his classic ""Caminando."""
1,"""Pooh, Bah!""","It's startling that this performance was released at all on DVD without a disclaimer on the backside informing the buyer that it is frequently inaudible. I wish I had read the bulk of the ... reviews before I purchased the set, for the warnings in just about all of them are exactly on target. Voices and music veer in and out of focus or range to an alarming degree for a 1990 production. The sound puts me in mind of the hilariously amateurish miking in an early talkie such as the one parodied in ""Singing In The Rain."" Since the production is such a recent one, I'm left wondering whether the unacceptable sound can in fact be the work of Opera Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ..."
1,Not so very much fun.,"This production from the Sydney Opera House in the late 1980s comes across as dated. This may have to do with the production values which have a bland videotape quality and poor sound reproduction. It may have also had something to do with the cast's ad libbing which made reference to Crocodile Dundee and other things Australian that I knew nothing about. I was also disappointed to see that this production was staged in a Victorian motif so that the characters were costumed in an combination of cartoonish Japanese attire blended awkwardly with 1890s British high hats, tails and walking sticks. This was supposed to be amusing but missed the mark for me. I was hoping for a Mikado dripping in elaborate kimono and hairdos that would do a Geisha proud. If that's what you're looking for, don't buy this Mikado."
1,Here's a not-so-pretty how-de-do!,"There is so little to commend this production of the Mikado. While the idea of an ""Alice in Wonderland"" approach has some promising possibilities, the whole show was so poorly pulled off that any hope of refreshing novelty vanished like the flowers that wither in fall (apologies to WSG). The sound quality is terrible. The acting was appalling. The actors excerized absolutely no restraint in their characterizations. I'm am not a tight-laced G&S follower. However, the energy level on stage was so uncontrolled it looked like a student-directed junior high school production!"
5,The Siege of hoots,"With so many books already I'm not sure if my shelf will be able to hold so many GaHoole books. here comes the best one yet though the thrill packed fourth book: The Siege!In this book enraged by his clash with Soren, Kludd plans to reform his evil group The pure ones place The Great Tree under siege! If he carrys out this plan before the tree is warned it may not recover and life around the owls may crash down! meanwhile The Chaw of Chaws is asked to return to St. Aggie's in order to spy on them. Soren and Gylfie have escaped from Aggie's before but can they do it again?"
5,Oooo... exciting,"Before I read this book, I knew nothing whatsoever about owls, except that they are nocturnal. Now I love owls. This book is one of the best. The first got me hooked, and I'm hoping to get the fifth and sixith soon. To everyone out there, you HAVE to read this book! (Along with all the others too)"
4,Suspenseful!,"This is a detailed, fast paced novel that is really hard to put down. As you may have gleaned from what I titled this, It is a VERY suspenseful book involving murderous owls who think they are superior to all others, a pitiless ""academy"" trying to control all other owls, and the noble gaurdians of ga'hoole, trying to stop both crazed groups. Though I recommend you read them in order, Lasky catches you up on what happened in the other books. For all you owl lovers, this is definitely the book for you. Complete with sientific names, the character list at the back shows you the type of owls Soren and the other characters in the book are."
5,soren lover spronk hater,"I totally agree with Otulissa! SPRINK ON SPRONK! Dewlap had no rightto spronk that book! besides, who,may I ask, besides Dewlap,DECLARED IT SPRONK??? really, people!wow, it must have been hard for soren and gylfie to go back to st.aggie's again.Okay, people who have read book 1 through 3, you wont belive who Mist is!!!okay. im' almost out of room. bye!!!!"
5,Violent yet extremely interesting(and sad),"Wow, this book was very interesting yet so sad! I've been looking forward to the movie for a while! I highly recommend reading the rest of the series to any newcomers."
3,A good overview of (primarily) Western saints,"Whatever it defects may be, I think this is a good reference companion for the beginner to succinctly see the historical significance of Western saints, some well known to many, others not as well known."
2,too flawed to recommend,"The main attraction of this DVD is the chance you don't get these days - to see Domingo not on vocal autopilot. Behrens may not be Tebaldi but she was a fine actress and Tosca gave her a chance to shine. The problem is MacNeil's vocally threadbare Scarpia. By this stage his ""singing"" was simply terrible (pitch problems, dry sound, no legato phrasing). Several other baritones would have been a far better choice but, then, most Met ""old timers"" know that backstage politics has far more to do with casting than talent. A better choice is the Kabaivanska/Domingo/Milnes video. Wait for it to come to DVD."
4,Don't be so hard on Behrens!,"No, she isn't Tebaldi, but watch how involved and totally commited she is to the character. You can believe that the two leads are in love (and not that cliched opera-acting, don't get too close you'll wrinkle my gown I can't look at this person I'm supposedly in love with because I stare at the conductor all evening way). She touches Domingo and looks into his eyes. Plus, instead of some kind of cool Germanicism or I'm-too-good-for-this-Italian-trash-because-I-do-Brunnhilde attitude, you get a fully commited warm-blooded performance. And yes, even though the Zeffirelli production is SO tired, it's still so beautiful."
3,Tosca and Scarpia should have been different!,"This performance, with Sinopoli conducting and the Zeffirelli sets, always thrills the audience. However, this particular cast was not appropriate. Except for Domingo, who is always first rate, Behrens doesn't have the Italianate sound, nor is she believable in the role of the beautiful singer. McNeil, now at the end of is career is stale. His tone is flat and unpassionate. The DVD I am waiting to buy is the Rome Production with Mehta as conductor, Domingo, Malfitano and Raimondi. Set in the actual places occurred, it is magnificent. Catherine Malfitano is a wonderful Tosca, Domingo is young and in top voice. Raimondi is a villainous Scarpia. This was like a movie-no clapping, no scenery rumbling. Please do yourself a favor and wait for this one."
3,Tosca?,"I love this opera.This video needs a lead that fulfils our image of Tosca, beautiful and bewithching."
5,Cornell MacNeil is spectacular as Scarpia!,"I have five ""Toscas"" on video and DVD. This production, done at the Met in NYC, is the best of the lot. I Have seen this same production at the Met and the scenery is wonderful. I agree it is Placido Domingo's best performances on video. Hildegard Behrens plays a very charming and believable Tosco. Her performance in ActII with Cornell MacNiel as Scarpia is particularly moving. But it is MacNeil who steals the show! He play the part of the villain with such exactness and facial expressions that at times he looks like Dracular! He is also in excellent voice for this performance. This is a ""don't miss"" Tosca."
5,Beautiful,"What can I say? In the thirteen years (has it really been that long?) since I first saw this video, I have worn out two copies.Tosca is my favorite opera of Puccini's, and this is the only good film I have seen.I would go out of my way at any time to see Domingo, since he isn't wooden, as is the style in opera today. His voice soars, and he actually brings something to Cavarodossi.Behrens is an unforgettable Tosca (although I've often thought Tosca should be a little younger - but this isn't a crack on her.)"
4,Still waiting for the definitive Tosca,"This is undoubtedly a powerful performance, with both Behrens and Domingo singing and acting superbly. Sinopoli's conducting is first rate, and the sets are stunning. And yet, for reasons I can't quite explain, something is missing in Behrens' Tosca. She really puts herself into the role, yet I just don't see her as Tosca in the way that Domingo is Mario Cavaradossi. This is purely subjective on my part, and if you are a fan of Behrens, her performance will definitely excite you."
2,Casting problems,"While the men sound good, our leading lady, in thread-bare voice, is hardly any idea choice for the heroine. Anyway, it's not too bad as a video but it would be much better if the casting director had been wiser."
2,Blu Ray Not Worth the Money,"Hoping for a cleaned up clear pic of this Thanksgiving classic, I was very disappointed. It seems to be only a transfer with no pic or sound improvement. Keep your DVD version and save your money. I sent mine back and was promptly refunded by Amazon."
4,WHERE'S LUCY??,"Though not as good as the two previous CB specials, it's still waayyy better than anything after it. ""Little Birdy"" is cool and sounds like it should have been a Lou Rawls number. But, where is Lucy? And Marcie is so cute! When I saw this on TV this year, didn't the Snoopy, Woodstock, pumpkin pie epilogue used to be with a turkey instead of the pie? Changed to unindict Woodstock from being cannabalist? Hmmmm."
2,"Part I is terrible, but Part II is good history","As a follow up to the epic ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" the 1st cartoon is a failure. Ugh! However the 2nd part does a great job dramatizing the story of the Pilgrims and their toils and dangers in coming to the New World. It's a good introduction to that history for younger children - say 5 years old and older."
5,A true piece of Americana! Passing down to our kids,Can't say enough about it. My kids thoroughly enjoy every minute of Charlie brown and the gang! I absolutely love archaic style cartoons.
4,"Peppermint Patty's ""shadow"" Marcie shines in this one","Remember Marcie? The bespectacled girl who's so in awe of the tomboyish Patty that she calls her Sir? Patty, who's long worshipped her ""Chuck"" from afar blows it bigtime when she invites herself, Marcie and Franklin to a Thanksgiving dinner--and then finds fault with Charlie Brown and Snoopy's culinary talents with toast, pretzels and jellybeans. After her host leaves the table in humiliation, Marcie politely but firmly runs her ""mentress"" through a reality check. Marcie gets 5 stars for gumption and diplomacy here, but the moral of the story is if you're so overbearing that you invite yourself to dinner, don't critique the menu."
4,A slice of childhood,"Charlie Brown Holiday specials are a big part of being a kid. I bought this because we cut the chord. Of all the DVD sets, this is the best, because it has 2 solid specials, Charlie Brown's Grandma's Dinner, also the Peanuts tell the story of the Mayflower."
4,Classics remain classics!,"I am so glad that I ordered this movie for my class. They loved it because who doesn't love Charlie Brown and Snoopy!? You can't go wrong with a classic for: NO foul language, no inappropriate parts for kids, and a warm storyline to boot!"
4,"Not the Great Pumpkin, but it still takes me back to the 1970s in a good way.","What you can you say about the characers created by Charles M. Schultz, they are classics. Is this the perfect special no, but it doesn't mean that they aren't part of the perfection of Peanuts world. Kid friendly with fun for parents who remember whent the world was a simpler place. Capture a tie to that simpler world with the joy that is Charlie Brown."
5,Don't Overlook This One.,The Turkey-Day special is often forgotten about due to the tremendous popularity of the Halloween & Christmas specials but it is just as good and in some ways better.
5,Classic,Nothing else to say - classic Charlie Brown/Peanuts! A requirement for family Thanksgiving TV watching. We watch it every year!
3,It's big and heavy,"It does what it's supposed to do but with a hex head and overall weight/size that seems to be twice what would be needed to secure the unit to a picatinny rail. If I had seen it before I bought it, I would have looked for a lighter,less massive unit."
3,Meh.....,"I didn't buy this to attach a bipod to. Instead, I bought it to attach my tactical sling. It's very sturdy, but my complaint is that the smaller metal piece, the clamp I guess, does not match the bigger piece. The metal on the clamp looked like it has been to hell and back. It bothers me whenever I look at this adapter and see the metal finish on the two pieces not match each other."
3,"It works but not the best, but the price it right!","Easy to put on and works but the when you try to attach the bi-pod the nipple pushes back and it makes it hard to attach quickly, but the once it's attached you are good to go!"
3,It works,Nice metal. Tightened my bipod too far and it peeled off the metal swivel stud. Stud metal is too soft but it works.
3,Some modification required,"I purchased this item to use as a sling mount on a rail/flashlight mount I added to my shotgun. The lenght of this piece was perfect for the rail that I added and it looks great on my gun. My only issue was that the hole through the stud was too small. I had to drill it out so my sling would attach to it which only took a minute but I still found it kind of silly that I had to drill out what should be a standard size hole for a sling. I think it was filled up with whatever coating is on the piece actually. Oh well, it works well other than that little issue, but for the price Im fine with it."
2,not good,The sling-swivel post isn't actually attached to the rail section.Even at full tension I can't get my bipod to snug up against the forearm of the gun.
1,Pro Mag Harris bipod adapter,"Yeah, it is cheap, and not too badly made, but shipping cost more than the product itself, which is bad. Buyers beware, sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case, it don't work. The arm that holds the Harris bipod arms together is way too long and allows the arms to slip out. I was bewildered for two days, thinking that I was doing something wrong, when I wasn't. Short story, I bought a LaRue QD mount, it arrived next day, and was on and working within a few minutes. Something I should have done in the first place instead of trying to cheap it. I will never buy another Pro Mag product."
1,READ CAREFULLY BEFORE BUYING!,"Everything would be perfect other than the bipod will not stay attached. The bolt that the bipod clamps to is too long. I have made modifications with epoxy and it works but you should not have to do this. I can not believe this has not come up before. If you are ok with a little modification, its perfect and cheep. Other than that I would have gave it 5 star but you only get one when you have to ""fix"" the product."
1,Not as good as they said,"The quality is ok. However, the ProMag PM108 Harris Bipod Rail Adapter does not fits the picatinny rails system as described. The bipod never get tight enough to be able to perform as described. I had to buy a different one."
3,"Built solid, but sling piece is too long","The product is build like a tank, the only problem is that it doesnt fit with the harris bipod perfectly. You'll need to put some padding in between to make it work perfectly. Also the sling pieace is wayyy too long."
3,Harris Bipod Rail Adapter PM108,"Nicely made, fits tightly to rail, mount plug is too long for Harris Bipod. You must add material to bipod so it will tighten securely to adapter. I use the rubber spacer ( Harris #7A ) for this purpose. I believe the mount plug should be 1/8"" - 3/16"" shorter."
5,ProMag Harris Bipod Rail Adapter PM108,excellent option to save money from buying the original harris bi-pod adapter. excellent quality and perfect fit with no problems. buy it!!
5,Great product,I love Harris product great quality built in the USA it is made with quality and pride just like it used to be
2,rail adapter,"My husband got this for his gun and he was not happy with it. He didn't end up using it. He said that it was loose and didn't fit right on the bipod. He also said that it would be alright to use for a sling. Sorry but he ended up buying another rail adapter that was sturdier, fit just right, and more heavy duty at a gun show. It might work for someone else - it just didn't end up working for us. Sorry."
1,does not mount solid,"The piece that the bipod mounts to is too long. When you tighten the knurled knob it bottoms out and the entire assembly has lots of movement. The bipod will even pop out easily if you move it around. After some frustration I finally ordered the TMS Quick Detach mount for $20. The piece that the bipod mounts to is a few mm's shorter which allows for a rock solid mount. The knurled knob doesn't bottom out and tightens down nicely. Do not buy the pro mag unless you like frustration. If they had made that little piece the bipod mounts to shorter, then the pro mag would more than likely work fine. Until they change the design it nothing more than a paper wieght!"
2,Very loose swivel,The swivel is very loose when the part is attached. I tried to attach a bipod to it but the swivel does not tighten up at all. There needs to be a way to tighten the swivel if desired.
3,fell off,"The product seems to be well made, but came off the rail and was lost. Maybe the screw needs lock-tite. I used this for mounting a Harris bipod. The bipod kept coming loose as well but I think that problem is with the bipod. I haven't got this all sorted out yet."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product does not work! The nut that the Harris bipod attaches to is too long and the bipod cannot attach. I would return it, but shipping would cost more than its worth. I fixed this by cutting apart some metal washers and put the pieces into the space between the but and the adapter; thus reducing the overall length of the nut. Do yourself a favor... spend a little more and get one that works out of the box."
5,Best bread pan,This pan makes the most beautiful loaves! We baked half the batch in standard metal pans and half in stoneware. The bread out of the metal pans had crusty sides and bottom while the loaves out of the stoneware were much softer. I won't be going back to metal bread pans!
4,nice bred pan,"THis is a great little bred pan. It is exactly the quality you would expect from the brand. THe only down side is the smaller size, but I knew that when I ordered it."
2,What is with the crack?,"I really, really wanted to like this pan. I've been looking for a nice stoneware bread pan for awhile, and thought this one would fit the bill. I never got to try it out, though, as it arrived with a crack in the bottom. I returned it, then opened what I thought was the new one. Instead, I found the exact same crack covered by a sticker. So, back it went again, and this time I asked for a refund. I am still looking for a good loaf pan, but won't be buying this cracked one again."
5,Excellent guides,"I purchased this Cheap Sleeps for an as yet unbooked trip to Italy. I have used the Cheap Sleeps/Eats in London, so expected to get valuable information from this book. I was not disappointed. My biggest problem will be deciding on which of the dozens of places Gustafson recommends to stay when I go. I know from past experience that I won't be disappointed in any of them, because she gives any cautions required right up front. I would definitely buy any Cheap Sleeps/Eats book for a city I was visiting."
5,Sleep Cheap and Enjoy It,"We used Sandra's books for both Italy and London and have had great success with them. In Italy we stayed in two of the most charming and wonderful hotels ever and have gone back to them a second time because we enjoyed them so much. Her information is accurate, her comments on cleanliness, location and amenities have been invaluable to us. We were desperately seeking a B&B in London and went to one she highly recommended. Believe me, it was more than adequate. In London hotels are very expensive and actually are pretty bare-boned but Sanda's information helped us to stay inexpensively, in a very convenient location, without breaking our bank account. I truly can't thank her enough for the recommendations in Italy. We love both of the hotels (Rome and Florence). We've also used cheap eats in Italy and London and found them helpful and accurate. Bravo Sandra! [:-)"
2,Not Too Reliable,"We used this book and her Cheap Eats book recently in Italy. Cheap Eats was great - fabulous advice every time! But this book left us underwhelmed. A lot of the information was out of date or incorrect. Our hotel in Rome was nowhere near where we thought it would be. From now on, we're using Let's Go for hotel recommendations"
4,Camry Brake Rotors,Installed without any issues. Been driving with them ~ 2 months and appear to be fine. Would have given five stars if these were mf'd in USA -- these were made in China.
2,The Art of War MP3 Format,This Audio CD only works on the computer. It does not work in the car CD player. Is there another format for this audio CD?
3,Some might find this helpful but.....,"Some people might find this helpful, but books like those by Carolyn Custis James actuall do more good in the long run. So read any book of this kind with a proper degree of caution - men and women often do think differently but you need the kind of insights that James's book gives to be able to go into more depth."
3,i'm sure it's good,"Being familiar with Gurian's earlier works, I'm certain this book will be equally good in it's content as well as it's delivery ... yet I am truly wondering how the only other reviewer was able to purchase, read, and review the book 24 hours prior to it's release.I've ordered it, and am looking forward to seeing what he has to say and how this can be used in my work as an educator."
3,A Bittersweet Introduction,"I was looking for a greater focus on neurobiology and neuropsychology and less on sociology. This book speaks to stereotypes of males and draws connections between the male brain and stereotypical male behavior, but its simplification of both men and women leave something to be desired. It makes dangerous leaps from biology to behavior and then to culture - the sharp reader will note statements inserted here and there that are broad or deep in meaning but are backed my little explanation and even appear off-topic. Be open-minded as you read this book. Use it as a learning tool in developing your understanding of the psychology of the genders, but by all means, don't blindly accept the explanations or recommendations this book makes."
1,Pith There Are Clear Agendas In Both Books,"I agree with jah.I have read both books from cover to cover.Once we are catagorised by gender we lose our individuality.The agenda is clear in both books in they state easilyreputed ""facts"" about ""innate"" gender behaviors.The reality of the individual works against these beliefs.I read Gurian's bookabout men and found myself in his discription of male behaviorand I'm a female.I know there is an agenda to have one gender rule over the other and what better way to do it then to lump people intogender specific behaviors.Brainwashed readers won't questionthe integrity of the book,all the while the individual isweeded out of society to make way for perfectly manipulatedStepford men and women.I have seen Gurian's homepage,the farright loves him because he mirrors the same agenda of thefar right for families,men and women."
5,Should be required reading for everyone,"This is an outstanding book that explains the differences between men and women in terms of their brains. It was an extremely valuable, eye-opening experience. I recommend to many of my psychotherapy clients."
5,"A must read if you have, want or are a man","If you want to explore the biology of the brain, search elsewhere but.... If you are a woman who can't seem to keep a man or a woman who loves a man who drives you nuts this is a book you need to read. It's also an excellent resource for a man who knows his mother is an issue in his life but can't quite figure out why.My partner and I have had many evenings of excellent conversations reading it together. It's helped us voice our needs for intimate separateness and discuss our perspectives on daily activities. The chapter on the nature of being a dad is a great discussion of a role that has been far too undervalued in our society."
4,Interesting perspective,"What Could He Be Thinking? is an attempt to understand why men do the things they do. I found the author's perspective interesting and although I didn't agreee with all of it, it gave me food for thought. So I recommend it with the proviso that you don't view it as a universal resource. Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self is the most constructive book for men and women because it shows us how to make the most of our emotions, decisions and create our best lives -- and is a simple timeless, universal style of thinking."
5,Man's Mind,"Really a good book. As an older person and always ""wondering"" I really gained knowledge on this subject and some i was not aware of."
2,Just waiting for newer studies to prove this book wrong,"This book was recommended to me by an author whose work I respect, but it just rubs me the wrong way. I have to give it credit for trying to be based on neuroscience, but something tells me the actual studies were much less conclusive than the book leads the reader to believe. Sorry if this is harsh, but I would compare the scholarly quality of this book to an extended popular magazine article. My advice: save your money."
1,Not a Good Reference,"I was alternately fascinated and shocked by this book. The fascinating parts were the studies. These we can look up elsewhere. The shocking part was what he decided we should learn from those studies. And he presented his personal subjective conclusions as fact and those conclusions were unbelievable and hurtful to women.Then I found out that he has a business helping parents raise their boys? I would not let him help me raise my sons after reading this. I don't think I would want my daughter to date anyone whose parents he helped. There was some really bad stuff in here not the least of which was recommending pictures that exploit and violate women, strip them of dignity and humiliate them (p*o*r*n). Anyone who recommends something so damaging to so many innocent people- for anything -must be thought of as someone who needs more growing up, not someone to count on for advice on raising children - certainly not as an expert on how 'the mind works'."
4,not bad,could not find a better item at the price including postage.I am very pleased with the album its good quality and well worth the time it took for delivery and considering it came from the states in only a couple of weeks could not be more pleased thank you Amazon
4,A little lacking...,"Hey now, I dig George and this is a good collection, but it's lacking in comparrison to the killer 2 disc Anthology collection. This collection has some good stuff, but for 30 years of hits, 1 disc just doesn't do George justice. I would only recommend this for fans that can't spring for the Anthology. Some other CDs I want to recommend are Bond's ""Classified"" and Mr.Deviant's ""Techno Obsession"" which is a mix of power rock and hard dance music to make some killer instrumentals."
3,George Thorogood,"Got this for Bad to the Bone, and the rest of the songs are okay. Got it quickly and in good shape."
2,Disappointing,"Some really poor/sloppy production values in this collection. The first five tracks sound like demo tapes, not finished products intended for distribution. It doesn't even sound like the entire band is present on those tracks. You won't hear anything that sounds radio ready until Track 6."
3,Half great / Half just ok,This would have been a 4 or 5 star if it had stopped at track 8. The rest of the cd is trying to hard and brings down the whole cd. Love the popular songs but the rest are just so so.
5,lovin' George,Greatest hits are always the best because they are all good songs. Can't mess with George he's bad to the bone~!
4,"""FANTASTIC""","As a previous manager in retail,the saying ""You need to take care of 68% of your customers,before you add a new consumers!""is prolific.I am enjoying the album I purchased.I'll be purchasing more in the future.THANK YOU,NEAL"
2,AMD Athlon XP heatsink & fan,"This heatsink/fan combination fit OK, despite being substantially larger than the original. It cools well, according to the temperature reading shown in the BIOS page.My only gripe is the noise. With the case open, my kids kept asking if there was a jet in our house about to take off. Even with the case closed, it's pretty loud. Don't use this combo if the computer is in a bedroom, unless you are really tired of being with your significant other."
4,flowmater 17395,the pipes are loud and need to be welded in place. the clamps are useless because they slide out of place. the product overall is what i expected.
5,Son disque le plus fort,"This is Zach's finest effort to date. Zachary Richard's music is probably best described as Americana-Francais. This album reveals an influence by the Americana sound of bands like the Jayhawks and Graham Parsons. Little wonder as much of Zach's early work in the 1970's was in a folk/country/cajun/soul vein. The sound is based in roots music (blues, country, folk, Waltzs cadiennes, etc.,) but is ultimately its own unique thing. Zach's singing is in top form and has a soulful quality that really stands out...and I'm talking about about vintage Stax/Volt type soul of Otis Redding and Carla Thomas here, not the current stuff. The only reason Zach is not better known is that he sings in French. If there is a definitve sound of the French-speaking United States, this is it. Zachary Richard is a national treasure and this is his most fully formed collection of songs. C'est vraiement merveilleux! Allez!"
1,The Leaky Machine,"We have had this machine for about 9 months. The machine has been in transit and in the repair shop 6 of those nine months. A friend wanted one but I told ,""Don't waste your money"". This thing leaks froms the overflow above the coffee basket. Many reviews tell the same story. The manufacture claims they are not aware of the problem. One rep actually told me I must be lying, as the machine can not leak as I discribed. It is finnally fixed. The next failure and it goes in the dump. This was suposed to be a treat for my wife and I. It has been a nightmare!!!"
1,steamer leaks rusty water,3 months after the warranty was over the steamer began to leak rusty liquid into the frothy milk. Upon inspection with a flash light in the steamer container I noticed that the metal parts were rusty and the plastic lining was flaking off. I have had nothing but trouble with the company and would NOT purchase another DeLonghi product. They DO NOT stand behind their product and their customer service is terrible.
2,"It's an okay coffee pot, but if you need a new part you're on your own",There's really nothing to complain about with this pot except that the plastic cover is flimsy and breaks easily. I've had mine for about five years and the cover (I've never even washed it in a dishwasher!) is completely useless. When I call the company to replace what is probably a $.50 plastic part they tell me that I must also buy a new carafe and that it will run me about $30..... not gonna do that - I could buy a new coffee pot that would also be 'just fine' for that kind of money.
4,Works well for us.,"We just got one of these to replace a Braun that we had for many years, also to replace a Salton Espresso machine that had broken. First of all, they must have corrected the carafe problem; we have no spilling problems at all. In fact, this one pours a lot better than the Braun did. My wife works for a coffee company and brings home all sorts of coffee blends. We tend to grind our beans at brew time. This coffee maker definitely makes better coffee than our old one did. Could be because the other one was old, but I think it because of temperature and speed. This on takes a little longer to brew a pot full because of the ""pulse"" action, but the resulting coffee is more flavorful and less bitter. The espresso could be hotter and it does seem to be a little weaker than with our old maker; just use a little more coffee than usual. We do like the little attachment that allows you to brew directly into two cups. Overall, we are satisfied that it was a good buy."
4,DeLonghi,"DeLonghi BCO70 Caffe Nabucco Espresso, Cappuccino, and Coffee BarGreat product, makes a great cup of coffee, espresso, and cappucino.Great price for this product."
4,What I like and dislike about the Delonghi,"It makes great tasting coffee, I no longer go to Starbucks $$$. I like hot coffee, and the machine does well maintaining it. I have not tried the cappicino nor espresso features yet. The ""how to use"" instructions are clear. I like the price of the machine. I like the strong to less strong coffee feature (dial): I use less coffee grinds than I used with my old percolator. I dislike the thin plastic construction (a plastic pin) and the swing away part that holds the filter and grinds. It feels very fragile. My husband has difficulty pouring the coffee from the pot into a cup without making a small mess. All and all I feel it is a good value for the money."
4,Warming plate on the esspresso is cold!,"I really like my coffee bar. The only problem is that, I have noticed the last two times ,the warming plate for the espresso is cold. I've only used it three times, in the last month. In fact I have only had the machine for a month. I guess if you want hot espresso microwave it! The frother to make cappuccino's is very hot. Otherwise the only flaw to this machine is not having hot espresso. Everything else on the machine works good so far."
2,didn't work for long,"I bought this coffee maker for my husband to replace an old dual machine we had for years. We only used the expresso side on occasion but the drip coffee maker got used more regularly, but not everyday. After about 16 months, it stopped working. The water would not heat or go through the filter. Thankfully I bought it at [...] so they took it back well past the warranty and gave me a full refund. Given our experience and the short-lived nature of this machine, I would not recommend it."
4,Excellent value,"I don't know why some of these people are complaining, I've owned this coffee maker for over two years now with daily use. It still works just as well as the first day we got it: perfect coffee every time. It's easy to use, great size and design, large capacity, and great style. My one complaint is that it would be good if there were a separate water reservoir for the steam system, it's very easy to accidentally brew with the extra water that's intended for steaming with."
3,"Taking the ""Espress"" out of Espresso","Actually, for the money - less than $100 - you get what you pay for and about what you'd expect. The machine makes fine brewed coffee, and the espresso is acceptable too. And I'm hoping the ill-fitting plastic brew basket lasts at least a year.My big complaint is that the machine is slooooooow. Making 4 cups of regular coffee takes twice as long as most comparable machines. Same with the espresso unit. AND, if the espresso blend is not medium grind (NOT espresso grind), you won't get anything at all -- a lesson I learned after returning first unit as 'defective.'So, if you don't mind an extra wait, this unit - at this price - is fine."
3,Coffee Not Hot Enough,"We purchased this unit a couple months ago, and were pretty happy with it overall...except for the fact that both the coffee and espresso didn't seem to be as hot as they should be. We figured we had a defective unit, so we returned it. The new unit produced the same lukewarm beerage. I suppose we'll keep it, but we'll just have to throw it in the micro every time before drinking it."
1,Not worth the money.,"We purchased this machine and enjoyed it about 2 months. The machine has had numerous little problems since the purchase, the most recent problem being that it leaked water really bad all over the counter. From what I understand here, that's not the first time someone has had that issue. I would not purchase this model."
4,So close and yet so far,"I'd have to agree with the reviewer who thought this was a terrific machine but seems to be built to spill. We have resorted to keeping a towel near the coffee maker because it is almost impossible NOT to spill while pouring hot coffee from the large glass carafe. BTW the carafe is now chipped and I am having a bear of a time finding a replacement carafe. we also bought a gold mesh filter which works great in this machine-IF it is bone dry before each use. If it's damp or if we forget to hand dry the coffee filter area, we end up with an overflow of hot water and coffee grounds on the counter.Dear DeLonghi, please rethink the carafe pour spout and NEVER sell a product with removable parts that can not be easily replaced. The coffee is delicious, the machine looks very cool...just make it work better."
3,Don't break the carafe!,This machine works wonderfully...but don't break either carafe!! I had to special order the carafe from Italy and it cost nearly as much as the whole machine. For whatever reason they are nearly impossible to find in America.
1,"Great at Coffee Making, Lousy customer service","Great coffee bar however if you should ever need to order spare parts, watch out.. The coffee pot developed a hairline crack in it after a week and of course the coffee leaked out. I called Amazon first who in turn gave me the number for Delonghi. I explained the situation and they told me I had to purchase a new pot and that the glass is not covered under warranty.. Here is the kicker, the damn coffee pot is 1/3 the price of the entire machine. $30.00 for a pot please, $5.50 for shipping.. I will never purchase Delonghi products again knowing this information."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"Finally, when it actually WAS over a year since I had received the coffeemaker, when I called to check on the status of my warranty claim, they said, ""Your warranty has expired. You've had this coffeemaker over one year. There is nothing we can do."" I highly recommend you find a coffeemaker from a manufacturer that stands behind their product! I have a Cuisinart now, and it is WONDERFUL!"
2,DLonghi BC070 Coffee Bar,"The machine makes great coffee, regular brew & espresso. I am disappointed with the frother. My old Krups machine does a much better job with the milk. The light indicating the espresso maker is turned on does not work. This has caused me to leave the machine on several times already. I am afraid it will burn up. If I had purchased it from a store, I would have returned it for another one that works."
2,It Leaks!,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it, though I think he had some trouble with the frother a few times. But after two years, it started leaking every time it was used -- coffee-colored water all over the counter. Looking at other reviewers' experiences with the warranty process, I think I'll just skip it and buy a new one. Probably better not to buy a coffee/espresso combo unit again, and definitely not a DeLonghi."
3,Dissapointing.,"I got this machine for my birthday while I was living in the dorms at college. All of my friends and I were excited to have an espresso machine around for our all-nighters, but from the get go we couldn't get it to work properly, much less work well. The main attraction for us was that it had both drip coffee and espresso, but the espresso quite honestly never came out tasting good. We also had problems getting enough pressure to steam the milk. It would never go long enough to heat the milk, and we would have to throw our coffee in the microwave (yuck.)The reason I'm giving this three stars is because the drip worked fine (all the three months I was willing to put up with this big machine in our room) and it's at a good price point."
5,Full of passion and romance!,"This book is outstanding! I'm not going to rehash the plot because it's been done many times before. I'll just say what I loved about the book. I loved Passion's quiet strength and I adored how undone Mark was by her. There was a connection between them that grew stronger each time they came together. No matter how hard he tried to keep the encounters purely sexual, you could tell it was more than that for both H/h. I cried the last forth of the book. This book was romantic and so HOT. I also really liked the relationship between Mark and his brother."
4,Passion with a capital P!,"I agree with the well written review by Misuzmama just below. The first half of this book is very erotic, but there is also a good story that is different from a standard romance. I could feel the genuine emotion portrayed between the hero and heroine. The sensuality is a step or two beyond a standard historical romance, but I liked the book and liked the writing. I will not hesitate to read more by this author."
5,Loved Passion!,I loved Lisa Valdez's Passion. This novel was a sizzling romance. I loved the characters and plot. I look forward to Valdez's future novels!
5,OMG!!!,"What a passionate, erotic, and romantic story. From the first page to the last page I was captivated. The two main characters were made for each other. I have never read a Lisa Valdez story, but after this one, it will not be the last!!!"
1,Boring & Unbelievable,"I don't really know what to say, except that I won't finish this book. This book was beyond boring and very unbelievable to me. The ""story"", the dialog, everything about this book didn't ring very probable or even possible."
2,This is written for a man,Sounds like it was written by a man. Little attention paid to what really pleases a woman.Surprised whereas it is written by a woman.
1,"Unfortunately, the negative reviews were spot on.","Terrible read. I'm all for steamy sex scenes, but there were so many that truth be told, I found myself reading quickly through them to see if there was actually a story in there somewhere. But nope, couldn't find one. After reading this I can't even tell you the difference between Mark and Matthew and as for Passion the character, she lacked exactly that, passion. I would recommend you pass on this one and try The Raven Prince by Elizabeth Hoyt. THAT had all I was looking for an more!The Raven PrinceIt is available as in the Kindle Edition as well."
3,Weak heroine,"I personally dislike the heroine who seems weak and burden. I especially hate the plot when she was touched by Mr. Swiftly. Damn, I would like her more if she could have punched him on a face and and kicked hardly on his softness. I couldn't beleive that after that incident she could still hung out with him for her Aunt's sake. She is just a typical heroine you can find in any romance books: beautiful, talented, weak and needs someone to depend on. I kinda expected something different when I purchased the book. Wish if I could return it."
4,Not just sex!,"I really enjoyed this story. The love scene ..okay the sex was amazing in this book. It was the first book I had read that was so graphic. But besides that, the story was really well written the H/H were great for each other and there were some points when even I shed a tear. A must read!"
4,Great Read!,"Just finished Passion. It's nearly everything I look for in a good book of this genre, decent length, (page count for the gutter minded like me) good writing, an engaging plot, fascinating characters, and steamy, scorching hot sex. My only quibble was with the self sacrificing tendencies of the main characters, but it was a different time then so I suppose it's more plausible than I'd care to read about. That said, I enjoyed it thoroughly and will definitely be reading it again.I'm personally disappointed that the author chose to take the sequel into the BDSM realm. Not that I'm being judgmental like some reviews of Patience I've read, but it's not a comfortable scenario for me as a reader. I might read it anyway as I did really enjoy Passion, but then again, I might wait for Primrose and take my chances that the next sister won't be into the same type of kink.Anyway, two thumbs up for Passion! It's rare to find erotic romance that's well written and also longer than a short story."
2,Just too much,"This book reminded me of the days, some forty years again, when I'd steal away with one of my mother's trashy novels, skimming over the endless pages of plot and characterization to get to the `good' parts--the graphic sex scenes. Only in this book I hurried through the endless pages of graphic sex scenes to get to the `good' parts--the likeable characters and decent plot. Really, I should have known better, with a name like ""Passion"". But it was well written and a decent escape novel, if you don't mind an abundance of scenes that border on porn. Unfortunately, I found I did."
2,A skim through novel,"I bought this book because of all the 5 star reviews ... great plot, great characters, great this, great that ... NOT TRUE ... the sex scenes are indeed plenty and erotic; however, at the end, because of their sheer number, I started skimming even them ... I am not going to recap the story ... I am going to say that it is a skim through novel ... not worth my money ... perhaps a cheap erotic romance might have sufficed instead ..."
3,not my cup of tea,"This book is so straightforwardly explicit about the sex, with plenty of bad words, and has an obsession with the man's size. Because of that, I wouldn't characterize this book as sensual or romantic. It doesn't really even have an emotional intensity to it, because the whole relationship is very bizarre to me: two strangers having sex within moments of meeting each other? Then promptly falling in love because of several sex encounters? Which is why I didn't really feel heart-wrenched by the ending. Although I could see the potential. However, if you're looking for a hot erotic (with very explicit/mildly dirty language) read, this is it. If you're looking for humor/emotional-intensity/realistic-portrayal, this really doesn't do well."
4,Shocking but enjoyable,"I read more Julia Quinn books and Judith McNaught and though I wouldn't call their sex scenes tame, they are compared to this book. I almost stopped reading when the F-word and the C-word were used multiple times in the first 10 pages! But I'm glad I kept reading. The characters were wonderful and I found myself hurting along with them as Passion and Mark struggle to be together. The plot was basic but well-written and kept me reading. If 'dirty' talk offends you, don't get this book. But if you want an exciting and erotic read with a historical plot and lovable characters, then pick this one up."
1,totally unbelievable story,"Based on the glowing reviews, I thought this book would be extremely sexy and romantic. Instead, it was just jaw-droppingly stupid. No man or woman, even today, would have sex in an exhibition hall unless they were an exhibitionist and wanted to be caught at it. With all the risks involved, that's not sexy, it's just dumb. The sex scenes between them were beyond cartoonish. I can hardly imagine a man today (except in a porn movie, maybe) using such silly words (such as the repetitive use of both the female and male C words) with a stranger, let alone over 150 years ago. The author totally wore those words and the F word out. And the scene where Mark argues with his mother and the size of his and his father's genitalia are mentioned, was offensive. I think this book deserves 0 stars."
1,All steam not much story,Two strangers become very intimate within the first twenty pages and it went downhill from there. It was so overdone that I had trouble finding an actual story beyond the very hot love scenes.
2,Not an adequate or satisfying introduction/technical manual.,"After reading this book in one short sitting, I am unsure as to why the author wrote it. The book basically describes a step-by-step process of Kyudo with several anecdotes sprinkled here and there. The reader is provided with many technical details, but is left confused from the lack of a fluid overview of the subject matter. The few illustrations that do exist provided very little descriptive aid to the text. Noticeable aspects of the book are its tone and language. The writing style is both cumbersome and reminiscent of a 1940's technical manual. The author also assumes that the reader knows very little of the Japanese culture and beliefs. While this is not a fault, it is an ineffective assumption for such a short book. I assumed that the book was meant to be an introduction to Kyudo. In this regard, the book failed to accomplish its goal, leaving anyone interested in Kyudo to search for a more substantial and clear text."
2,Of interest...just,"Kyudo: The Japanese Art of ArcheryBy William R.B. Acker,Joseph Acker.A little book so if you fancy it order it with another to keep the postage down. Interested in Archery whilst based in Japan the author decides to take the Japanese route to Archery, and as with most sports in Japan there is a discipline of archery called Kyudo. There are some good interesting comments on physical stance and concentration that will make the difference to improving your skills."
2,Video Content OK. Audio is ONE channel ONLY.,"I purchased Music Scene - Best of 1969-1970 (Vol. 1) DVD and decided to go for number 2.Number 2 has excellent video but ONLY ONE audio channel.Vol 1 has, at least, 2 channels and I do not know how vol 2 comes with ONLY one audio channel (which is the center channel, by the way).If you are looking for video and the images, its OK. If you are looking for the audio, be ready to listen to ONE channel only.Ed."
3,A reminder,"This disc of videos and performances from the late 60s is an embarrassing reminder of how silly some of that music actually was. Hearing it on the radio is okay, but watching some of the performers live caused me to question my affinity for sixties rock and roll. Obviously, there are some gems on this disc, but overall, it is simplistic, silly, and dreadful. Most of the truly good artists from the era don't appear, but several of the very popular ones do. Don't look for the Beatles or the Stones. One highlight is a great performance by Janis Joplin. Other than that it is simply silly fun."
5,...And this one is just right,"I purchased my camera and all the extras (battery charger, card reader, extra card, etc.) on Amazon, but looking at all of the bags, it was really hard to choose. This is a bag I saw and bought in person and it is just right for my Minolta Dimage s414. The soft interior protect the LCD panel, the divider is adjustable so I could fit in the battery charger, and there is a small packet in the lid, and a zipper pouch in the front with pockets to fit in spare cards, batteries or anything else you might need. I'm quite pleased with it."
4,Cute little Birdhouse,This birdhouse is about half the size of the Astonica A-Frame Birdhouse. It is made of rough hewed pieces of logs for that rustic look. There are open spaces between and around the three roundish twigs that make up the bottom of the house for ventilation and drainage.My husband spent a few minutes modifying one of the side roof panels so we can open and clean the house.I'm very pleased with it.
3,half price for a reason,"Birdhouse has strong hickory smoke (?!) odor. More importantly, there is no apparent way to clean it, i.e. it does not open. It's decorative, but not very functional."
3,"Decorative, but not practical","I liked the look of this birdhouse, so I got it for my yard. It's very cute, and looks like a little tiny log house. My biggest issue with it is that it's so small! Very few of the birds in my yard are so small, so it's really useless as far as for being a birdhouse. I guess it's a good thing no birds will be living in it, as there is no way to open it up for cleaning. It does look nice though, so I'll keep it around for awhile."
3,page turning yet disappointing,"Despite a terrific opening, this tale ultimately needs stupid people to move the action along. Our hero's wife foolishly puts herself in harms way and insults the reader's intelligence. This is my first reading of this author. I may give him one more try. Can a 50ish hero really jump into Alaskan water and still function?"
2,Similes and Metaphors,"If all the adventure authors were forced to eliminate similes and metaphors from their books, they'd have to write more real words. A phrase such as ""as if she were a wild horse suddenly put to the bridle . . "" when the author is talking about a boat. Or ""as if a fire had been lit beneath the bedrock, and the expanse of water was coming to a slow simmer."" when the author is talking about a lake. These peculiar similes tend to destroy the credence of the author. Not only that, but this writer does some sloppy writing where the protagonist is facing his wife, then in almost the next sentence she has her back to him.Glad I didn't buy the book, just borrowed it from the library.It may be that there is but one adventure author who sells his output to other ""authors"" to publish as their writing. Could be?"
5,"Ohh Flabby, you are great!","Please listen first the ""Parole, parole""s newest version which you might listened from Dalida and Alain Delon. Then you will see the difference between old and new."
5,Great continuation of the PosleenVerse!,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the 4 previous Posleen War novels, I thought that this parallel sequel was very entertaining. This tale leaves the Armored Combat Suits behind and deals exclusively with the European Posleen war. In desperation, Germany turns to rejuvenation of the despised Waffen S.S. veterans in nursing homes to turn the tide agaist the alien horde.Generally a well conceived and written book. Very good development of the central characters; i.e. Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Hans Brasche, and Generalmajor Walter Muhlenkampf. Hopefully the forthcoming novels in the PosleenVerse will be as good! I waffled about giving this 5 stars or 4, but after realizing that I read this one three times--5 stars!"
4,It rattles people's stereotypes,This book is very well written. The reason people dislike this book so much is the fact that it destroys their stereotypes. It moves the SS from being some sort of uniformed monsters and into the realm of human beings. Some are good and some are bad. Most are people trying to do the right thing and making mistakes along the way.
4,Small mistakes and a heavy problem,"It only takes one or two mistakes by the author to upset the flow of an alternative history book. There were two that caught my eye: the iron cross 1st class was worn on the left breast pocket or thereabouts and had no ribbon. It was not worn around the neck. Second: the tiger III tank discribed by the book would not work, it was far to heavy to keep from sinking in to the ground. The US tried a very heavy tank and the ground would not support it."
2,Boring & Confusing,"I love most of Ringo's books but this one was slow, confusing, and boring. He talks too much about the SS soldiers past and not enough about killing aliens. Also the end was anti climactic-we don't know what happened to Europe and the rest of the world, but they're trying to bomb a Darhel planet."
4,"Sal, Eddie Costa and Phil Woods, swing hard","This CD has some great tracks. Main solist are Sal, Costa and Phil. Sal has a great guitar sound and the band sounds great. This is another example of the 50's guitar sound. Much of the interplay between Sal and Costa, is a preview of the recording's Tal Farlow and Costa did a few years later. This is not as great as those, but I was very happy to see this re-released. If you like the sounds of Tal, Sal, Raney, Barney, from the 50's, this is for you!"
1,"DO NOT BUY, I used it once & it stopped working","This item does not even deserve 1 star, but that's the lowest rating I could give. I ordered it and the fist time I used it it worked fine. The second time I sued it only one quarter of the mat actually heated up. Very poor quality do not waste your money. I am returning this item to Amazon today and I sure hope they don't charge me return shipping, I should not have to pay return shipping on a defective item."
2,Sunbeam long heating pad,"i have a smaller Sunbeam heating pad that I really like. I thought the longer model would be of the same quality, but it is not. The plastic cover is really stiff, and doesn't even get more pliable with use."
3,arthritis sufferer,"The product works very well. However, after using a cloth one for several years I find that the plastic crumples out of shape and I constantly have to straighten it out, which isn't particularly easy."
4,Well Executed Ordinary Heating Pad,"This is a nice uncomplicated heating pad. The control is quite wonderful. It is large, easy to slide and has a audible and tactile click for each setting. As the other reviewers note, there is no automatic shut off which is a boon if you want long term, low temperature heat. I rated this heating pad four stars because it is a nicely done ordinary heating pad but it does not get very hot."
4,liked this a lot,no auto shut off. perfect for my hurting shoulder. I can lay with it and it doesn't shut off every 45 minutes.
5,A really usable heating pad,Ive had heating pads before that I was afraid to use and ultimately threw away. But this is wonderful for back and shoulder aches.
3,Not For Short People!,"Once upon a time I lived in a house designed by a man who happened to be about 6 and a half feet tall. He hung the mirror in the bathroom so that he could see perfectly. I had to stand on a stool to put on mascara and never could see my lips. The same guy must have designed this heating pad!The new controller is nice and easy to use, but it is placed so far out the cord that I have to fish around and reel it in to turn the heating pad off. Not so wonderful when my bursitis is acting up at three in the morning."
1,They should put all the warnings written on the cover on the selling page!,Well I have to say that if I had been able to read all the warnings on the cover before I bought this I would have never wasted my time. I mean who would in there right mind use something that says no matter what setting you use this thing that it can burn you. If they cannot use a decent temp meter then it is not worth even using. That and the other 10 things they say you can't use this thing for makes it very dangerous and leaves you with no piece of mind. Back it went.....
1,The worst heating pad I ever bought,This heating pad is effectively useless. It takes a long time to heat up and then generates very little. I don't understand the warnings included with it about not burning yourself. This pad couldn't burn anything with the heat it creates. I bought it to use on severe cramps that I get in my feet--it turns out that wrapping my feet in a blanket works much better.This is the second Sunbeam pad I have purchased and I will never buy another. A useless product if there ever was one.
5,Works excellently,"I'm happy to report that it's rather excellent. The exterior is polyester, fairly comfortable against fabric or bare skin. There are three heating settings, which I can match to my level of discomfort."
5,Perfect Size,"Heat settings are just right, the size is large enough to cover the length of my back long-ways or the width of my shoulders and a little more sideways. I'm currently in Afghanistan and use this almost every night, it does the trick."
4,works well for me,I often have cold feet when going to bed. I have tried foot warmers that have not worked well. Spreading the pad at the foot of the bed for a brief time has helped.
5,Provides nice even heat.,We bought this pad to replace one that was lent out and never returned. I'm kinda glad we had to get it since it is head and shoulders above our old one. Controls a wide range of useful temperatures and heats across the whole pad.
1,Disappointing!,"Heat is inconsistent. The cover comes off easily, just one snap holding it on. The sponge (for moist heat) ripped befre I even used it. The whole pad wrinkled up and is misshapen within a week. Extremely disappointed. :("
4,luv it,I bought 2 of these heating pads for my 2 children ages 2 and 3.5 years to use when we go camping in late spring and fall. We my family of 4 tent camp in northern michigan and the U.P. but in Aug it can get down to the 40's and 50's at night which is hard 2 keep the little ones warm at night. I chose this heating pad because it stays on all the time without auto shut off!!! and I felt the reviews from previous purchasers fit my needs. I have had no trouble with the controller over heating nor the cord for that matter and it didn't get too hot under a layer of blankets to overheat the babies or burn them :) but they were toasty warm. In fact after reading the other reviews I was cautious getting up in the night to check them for over heating and they were not hot. I am very satisfied with the heating pads well worth the money.
3,Hot hot enough,Just bought this product a few weeks back. It comes with a long cable but the pad does not get enough hot to allow the heat to travel through you normal clothes. I would have preferred it more if the maximum heat was more.
4,great product- comfortable and good size,I think this is a good size and the cord is long enough to make it flexible in use.
4,Good Product,"I ordered this product so I could relieve muscle pain (when I had it) and warm up my bed before I get into it at night. I have really enjoyed having it. It says not to use while sleeping, but I have fallen asleep and forgotten to turn it off before and so far I have not blown up. It must have a safety feature for those of us with forgetful minds."
3,"Satisfied - No auto shut off, be careful not to burn yourself","We love our heating pads. Please be careful tho...Most heating pads theses days have auto shut off to preventburning you. This one DOESNT, aside from that we really like them ;D"
1,Doesn't Get Hot Enough! Buyer Beware!,This product does not get hot enough even after leaving it on high for half an hour. I'd suggest looking elsewhere if you are looking for a good heating pad. This won't cut it unless you are extremely sensitive.
4,Nice and toasty,This heating pad is warm and toasty. I would have given it 5 stars but it had a smell to it that was somewhat unpleasant. I am sure it will fade and I definitely would purchase again.
4,Great product,"I liked very much my new heating pad, it is bigger than my previous heating pad and accommodate my entire spine, from neck to lower back at once. I do recommend it."
5,Works Great !!!!!,Unit warms up quickly. The large size evenly distributes the heat. Anyoneneeding a large pad would do well getting this model.
2,Doesn't heat up enough,"The delivery of this product was on time. When I put it on high very little heat comes out. I contacted the Seller and I was told a return label would be sent to me in a day or two, I would have pefered a return label enclosed with item. It is a large heating pad, too bad it doesn't work."
1,Barely gets warm,This thing barely gets warm. I don't think you could keep a hamster warm if you rolled it up in it. It isn't a heating pad it is a lukewarm pad. It is a 50 watt pad. The hundred watt lamp next to me keeps me warmer. It even has warnings on it about skin burns! What a joke. The only way this will burn you is freezer burn.Sheesh!
1,Is it on?,"This pad might get warm enough to make yogurt or hatch chicks (I don't know), but it certainly doesn't get hot enough to make your back feel better."
5,Looking for a pad that doesn't have automatic shut-off? This is the one you're looking for,"I had bad luck finding heating pads without automatic shut-off, and I ran into this one from the reviews. This is a large heating pad. It has three settings. It is a reliable, no-frills heating pad. I'm very satisfied with it. I never have to worry about the pad turning off on its own."
1,Did not work well at all!,"I purchased this item for my husband who was having lower back pain. I assumed that since the Sunbeam brand is familiar to me, the product SHOULD be good, right? Well, it honestly worked for less than a week, and then it would ONLY get slightly warm. After reading the reviews, I should have thought twice about the purchase, but I thought ""how hot do people expect these things to get?"" Well, I can tell you that this heating pad was only SLIGHTLY warm and that after being on the highest setting for quite a while. If you are purchasing a heating pad to give you pain relief from sore or stiff muscles, you want it to get warm/hot enough to provide that relief. This product did not. Save yourself time and money. Do not purchase this item! Maybe we received a ""bad one,"" but, I have since purchased a different brand of heating pad for my husband, and it actually works!"
2,Poor choice,"Good points-CHEEP, no automatic shut off after long use.Problems: Takes TOO long to warm up, at lease 15 to 20 minutes and then not really HOT.The cover does not protect you from the sharp plastic edges of the pad. Can get scratches.It's long enough but could be 2 to 4 inches wider, doesn't cover the right areas.The plastic crinkles and is uncomfortable, noise and hurt.Motto: You get what you pay for, and in this case maybe you don't, you get less.Suggest you spent a bit more money, buy some other brand (not Sunbeam) and you will probably be much more satisfied."
4,Good Heating Pad,"Works just fine. I've never used the ""moist"" option, so no comment on that. I like the larger size and the fact that the heating pad doesn't shut off automatically after a certain amount of time, but this is a personal preference. Good price compared to what's at the local drug stores."
5,GREAT and LOVE THE SIZE!,"I got this after reading the reviews on here. I love the brand and the size! It works very well and heats up quickly. Getting older and getting so many more aches and pains...this is a Godsend! It's just the right size to cover your thigh, wrap around your knee or place around your shoulders. I have even placed it on top of my head to relieve sinus pain and headaches!"
4,Good product.,"It heats up, and the cord feels long enough to stretch across the couch. The three heat settings are nice, although I only use the highest one."
2,Cheap Chinese Stuff,"This is the worst heating pad I've ever seen. It takes 12 minutes just to heat up to the medium setting, and the pad doesn't hold its shape well at all, frequently requiring tedious reshaping by hand. A heating pad is supposed to be something in the background that doesn't require a lot of thought or effort, and this item falls well short of that.I'm tempted to return it, but it does actually work, so I guess we'll keep it as a spare that I hope we never have to use."
3,Fine for occasional use,"Normally I like Sunbeam products. But all the materials used to make this heating pad seem cheap. I'm concerned that it won't hold up to my weekly use. The temperature gets very hot, which is good. But I think the lowest setting is still rather warm, which is all right unless you are on it a long time."
5,King size heating pad,"I've gone through many heating pads over the years and this one is by far one of the best! The size, large controls, and the fact that it doesn't have the auto shut-off are among the perks! And you couldn't find a better price than Amazon's either! I highly recommend this heating pad!"
4,Sunbeam Heating Pad,Product works as advertised. It is large. If I were to purchase another I'd buy a smaller size. Product works great and is easy to use.
5,Very Happy with item,"Very happy with item. Heats well. Longer length than I expected. No auto shut off, which I LOVE. Great price!!"
3,"Okay, but...","I use this one in my living room chair so the always on feature is great. BUT, the pad itself constantly needs flattening out and the cover just slides around and gets bunched up. To me this means the wires are having to be constantly unkinked which I would imagine will shorten the life span of this unit."
3,Ehhh,"It's not very hot. I sleep with a heating pad almost nightly and it never gets very warm to me. I also don't like the case and how it only has one snap holding it in. The darn pad comes out of the top and bunches up nearly every night. I am still trying to come up with a solution of how to keep the thing in there straight. I think there are better products on the market, but on the plus side, it's pretty big."
3,"love the no auto shut off....hate the crinkling, folding and creasing plastic","The title pretty much covers it. The ""auto-shut off"" feature in this pathetic world of 'we can't protect ourselves' is why most people buy this, myself included. Apparently, at some point in time some ass clown filed a law suit and changed heating pads forever.That said, this also is flawed, hence only my 3 star rating. The flaw is that the heating elements are wrapped in a type of plastic that doesn't hold its shape. It bends, folds, creases and curls. Therefore, you have to unsnap the cover, pull it out and physically stretch it back out with your hands. You can get it fairly close to its original shape, but not really and it takes a diligent effort at that.Probably still a good price value, but why can't we all just get what we want??!!"
2,just ok,"The blue thing is constantly coming off. The material inside is always crumbling up. Sometimes all I have is the white part that heats up. It heats up well and does it jobs, but I get tired of having to but the blue part back on."
2,Sunbeam Heating Pad,"I like the size of the heating pad. It does NOT have an automatic shut-off, which is fine with me because my old one would shut off when I didn't want it to.The thing I do not like about this pad is that it is very stiff, and the chord is also very stiff. The chord won't straighten out without pulling on it, and then when you let go it goes back to being all kinked up again. It is hard to handle. NOT recommended."
2,Not the best,"This pad is a nice size but I found the plastic felt like it was over-heating. I also didn't like that the cover twisted all over and pilled in the wash. Fortunately, the pad died after about 2 years of use. I won't buy another one like it."
1,Dead in 5 months,"It was great while it lasted....June 12-October 6th. A waste of money in my opinion, absolutely worthless if I have to buy another one."
1,useless,"this product i ordered for my mother take so long to heat. and the heat level is a joke, its so useless"
2,Don't waste your money.,"Takes a long time to fully heat up. Cover is ill-fitting, slides around, and the one plastic snap is not sufficient to keep it on."
1,Doesn't get hot enough,"I love the size of this heating pad & that it doesn't have an auto-shut off but it simply doesn't get hot enough. When I opened it out of the box I was thinking I finally found the perfect heating pad but unfortunately, it's just another heating pad that doesn't live up to it's name. I'm really surprised they claim it to have UltraHeat Technology because unless I have a factory defected pad, it's a misleading statement."
1,Sunbeam heating pads,I purchased because of the price and brand name - let' me be succint - they sucked! very poor quality - I am surprised Sunbeam has let their brand fall that low : (
4,Sunbeam Heating Pad,Just the right size and just the right amount of heat. Unit does NOT shut off automatically after 2 hrs as promised!
4,large heating pad but no auto-off,"The size of this heating pad is great, it is about 50% longer than my old heating pad, which is useful for muscle spasms, muscle pain, and joint pain. However, there is no auto-off mechanism. This is only problematic for me because I tend to use it on medium or high at night to soothe back pain as I'm falling asleep, and underneath me + blankets, it eventually gets really hot. I end up waking up to toss it to the side."
5,Sunbeam is the best for Heating Pads,"I have tried many heating pads, and Sunbeam seemsn to be the best for the price. My heating pad is still going strong. Would recommend product."
2,I wouldn't do this again,We have purchased 2 of these and they just don't last. If you get a month out of it you will be one of the lucky ones. Do yourself a favor and pay a little bit more for a better unit. You will be very happy you did.
5,Good heating pad,"I needed to replace a heating pad that we had for about 10 years. This heating pad was a good choice. The heat selection is a slide that is easy to use. The heating pad warms nicely without any hot spots. When you need moist heat, dampen the included foam pad and it delivers warm moist heat right where you need it."
5,Great product for the price,"Oversized. Heats well. Clean look and feel.Great for back or to wrap around strained leg muscles.Item ships in original box, which was nice, too!"
1,Worthless,"I am forced to assume that the folks who designed this heating pad have never needed a heating pad themselves, as it barely gets lukewarm at the highest setting after half an hour. Seriously, a better use of my time would have been to get my cat to sit on my back, as he puts out more noticeable heat than this piece of junk."
1,Don't Worry About Getting Burned...,"...just don't buy this worthless ""heating"" pad. Towels just out of the dryer are warmer than this piece of junk, and that's when it's supposed to be on ""high"". Lucky I bought it at Walgreens and returned it the next day. My old Sears heating pad was just right and lasted over 25 years, but they don't make them any more [of course].I'm buying another brand, but I'm going to turn it on at the store to make sure it actually works."
1,heating is not good,heating is not good. item description says heating is good but heating is very bad.even i have heated for 30 minutes and it did nt work
1,Non-ergonomic design,Poor design... How to do you except it to stick to your body when it doesn't come with any strap on features.I bought this basically because I sit for long hours to study and my back hurts... Heat therapy is effective in improving circulation and provides relief from back pain.. I also use this for my shoulder injury... but again.. I cannot tie it in place..I used to have an electric heating pad that came with a velcro strap.. It was very convenient and easy to use.. This one is horrible.. The heating effect is fine.... but design.. I would give 0/5 if I had an option.
2,not hot enough,I returned mine. don't know if it was a bad one or if the heat is just low. I used it one day and the high setting simply was not warm enough...
5,Just what I wanted,"Yep, this is exactly what I needed. This pad does NOT have the ""auto off"" feature, which is very hard to find (one without it). Large size is extra nice."
5,finally found a hot pad without that annoying auto-shut off!! HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!!!,I am so happy to get this hot pad that will stay on until I turn it off!!! My dog is happy about it too!! Now she doesn't have to freeze if I'm not home to turn it back on and I don't have too wake up several tines during the night to turn it back on!! :DHAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!!!
5,Great product!,This heating pad has met all my expectations. The longer length is just waht I needed. I am so glad I purchased it!
3,tbh it looks good,"but I have not had a chance to use it. I have it on stand by for the time I need it, which hopefully I will not need it."
5,Very Good,"I really like this heating pad, it is very big, and the cord is nice and long and it heats very well."
5,Great in-bed foot warmer,"After 25 or 30 years of faithful service, my old heating pad gave up the ghost and I ordered this one to replace it. The large size is perfect at the foot of the bed so that my feet stay warm even when I change positions. The power cord is long and the control is conveniently placed. Probably the thing I appreciate most is that it never gets too hot, and the lowest setting still provides enough warmth. Great product at a great price."
2,not so good,"I bought it for my lower back pain, on high heat it did get pretty hot but after about 5 minutes, it totally loses it's heat, I tried turning it off and then on again, but it didn't really do the trick, I don't know it's just defunct, darn thing, shoulda got a stanley."
1,Poor performance,"For aches and pains of arthritis, nothing beats a heating pad behind the back while watching TV. We ordered three of the Sunbeam King Size pads for this type of use because the price was so good. However, after only a few hourse use, the first one quit heating on all three settings. Maybe pad #2 will last longer."
2,Pad Does Not Retain Flat Shape,"This heating pad had a low price and it heats well. Unfortunately, it is almost unusable. After the first use, the pad ""scrunched"" in on itself and I haven't yet been able to get the pad back to a flat shape. The pad itself feels plastic and cheap, and the cover comes off very easily even when the cover is snapped on. I never tried the ""moist heat"" feature. It consisted of a very thin, cheap, sponge-like square (same size as the pad) that could be removed (which I did). Now I know the reason for the low price."
5,NO Auto Shut-off!,Hard to find king-size heating pads that don't have the bothersome auto-shut-off feature. This is a good buy.
3,Average Quality,"This king size heating pad is of average quality.Cons:* I don't like the blue cover, it's an uncomfortable polyester fabric.* It hums and is kind of annoying if you are using near your head.Pros:* 3 heat settings.* Fast heat-up.* Large size, 12"" x 24"".* Long cord, 9 ft. long.It does not have auto-shut off. I didn't list that under pros or cons because it depends on what you are looking for.Overall, it's a fine heating pad but I like a cotton cover much better."
1,DANGEROUS ! DON'T BUY THIS ITEM.,"When I originally wrote a review for this item, it was a favorable review. After having had the pad for a few months, I strongly recommend that you not purchase this heating pad.I had the pad for a few months, the pad was used sparingly and was not abused. One day, while I was using it, the controls began to burn and smoke (the setting used at the time was the lowest setting.) Thank Goodness! that I was right there, had I stepped out of the room for a few minutes, my entire couch could have been set alight.I have tried several types of Sunbeam heating pads, they all have defective controls and don't last. But- I had never seen one ignite itself before......'til now.Please do avoid this pad."
4,Good Heating Pad,"My husband has back pain which is helped by moist heat. We have a microwave heating pad that is wonderfully moist but the heat is short-lived. I ordered this to try as an alternative. The heating pad is nice, the size is good, and auto shut-offs annoy my husband, so I was glad not to have one. However, the little spongy pad intended to provide moist heat doesn't work very well. It dries out quickly and doesn't emit nearly as much moisture as our current microwave pad. Buy this for the large size, nice heat, and extended use, but not for the moisture component."
5,Five stars for high heat and no auto-off!,"I want to be very clear about the reasons that this heating pad gets five stars from me: I wanted a pad that a) gave me good, strong heat, and b) didn't automatically turn off.This pad does both of those things.I finally threw it away this year (I bought it in 2010, it is now 2012) because the plastic edge close to the power cord was actually starting to become brittle and split. Prior to that time, like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the pad cover that comes with it was REALLY annoying, and constantly exposing the plastic edge and sliding off.I'd definitely buy this pad again, but I'd probably modify the cover with some adhesive velcro strips in order to keep it on better."
5,Excellent choice for a heating pad.,"This is a good quality heating pad. No, it doesn't have automatic shut-off, but my husband likes that, since now his heating pad (for his back) doesn't shut off on him when he's using it. For him, it's a good thing. The heating pad works well, heats quickly, and is a good value."
3,Where's the Heat?,"Just got this today. I don't know why but heating pads these days don't generate much heat. I got one at CVS and after setting it to *high* as a test it took forever and the heat was what I would expect on low. Took it back, got my money back and got this one from Amazon. Same thing. The heat is a little higher but not much. We need one for my elderly mother and will settle for it for now. I'm not saying don't buy this one. Just be prepared to wait a year for the heat to come and don't expect the pad's *high* to be the standard version of high. If anyone out there knows of a better version PLEASE let me know."
4,I really liked this product. It wasn't greasy ...,I really liked this product. It wasn't greasy and it left my face moisturized. Another feature that I liked was that it didn't sting like other products that I've used in the past. I'd definitely recommend this product.
3,This product was ok. It has a nice ...,"This product was ok. It has a nice clean scent, but I wish that the scent would last a bit longer. As to whether or not it helped get a closer shave, I didn't notice any great difference from regular shaving cream or even an electric razor. I probably wouldn't spend the money to purchase this product."
5,hard to find item,"My husband loves this product, but it is hard to find in stores.He has used it for years, tried other brands, but always comes backto Afta. So much easier to just order a quantity on line."
1,POOR,They sent me the wrong item. When contacted I was told the correct item if in stock would be shipped and I would be notified. Never got a call. Called them many time after that and no answer. I am still waiting to see my credit for returned items. Will not buy again.
2,"As a pre-shave, it worked well. My skin ...","As a pre-shave, it worked well. My skin was less irritated and smoother using this product than when not using it, however, this product is extremely aromatic. The smell caused my breath to catch and my eyes to water. Also, there was a lingering coating left on my skin that had an extremely bitter taste. There was no way to avoid getting it on my lips except with very careful application and washing afterward. The taste remained up to several hours and interfered with the enjoyment of my meals."
2,It kind of works. I guess.,"Bought this after an extraordinarily bad suggestion to try Lectric. Some pros and cons:Pros:-Much cleaner than Lectric.-Sort of worked. A little.-Smells fine.Cons:-Sort of didn't work. A lot.-Drew bloodAfta seemed to help a little bit in some of the areas that really didn't need much help in the first place, but problem areas like under the chin and near the Adam's Apple were still left with a significant amount of hair. And for the first time ever, my electric razor actually drew blood - twice. Never happened with Lectric, or sans-treatment entirely. I really wish I could return this to the store, as I don't have any use at all for the rest of the bottle. I'm giving up and going back to razors."
1,It BURNS my face!,"This stuff burns my face and a bottle of it doesn't last very long either!!!! I will never use it again. I once bought a bottle of Stetson Pre Electric that worked pretty good, but it was kind of oily! For the most part, I'm gonna used my old stand by: William's Lectric Shave! You can't beat the best!!!!"
1,Wrong Product,"I never have used this product, I wanted the Afta Pre-Electric (as picture above shows) and got the Afta After Shave Conditioner. It cost more to return this product than it is worth."
4,smells good,"I have been buying for years, it does like the commercials used to say, tightens pores and chin chillers, tone your skin and make it smooth and comfortable after shaving, smells good too."
5,Mennen Afta After Shave Conditioner,"I have using this product for many years, I absolutely love it. In my shopping area, it was becoming difficult to find. Finding it at Azamon.com, and, in quanity was great."
4,Afta pre-electric shave lotion,This is the best product I could find anywhere since Williams Lectric Shave Ultra was discontinued.
1,Perpetuates the worst aspects of legal writing.,"The idea behind this book is good. But the execution is poor. I agree with some of the advice the author gives about the sample documents. But that's where my agreement ends. Two main problems:First, the samples are written in overly formal, archaic legalese. Young lawyers will pick up many bad writing habits if they mimic these samples. They perpetuate the worst aspects of legal writing and are far behind the times (despite the book's title) when it comes to clear writing.Second, the samples use fictional names that try to be clever and cute. It becomes quite distracting. For example, it might be clever when Ima A. Torney of the law firm of Over & Dunne writes a demand letter to Ben Borrower on behalf of Sam Shark. But imagine this effort at cuteness spread over 70 documents. I was spending more time puzzling over the names than I was reading the documents."
4,"Reissue of 1958's ""Heavenly Sounds in Hi-Fi""","Though this looks like just another Ferrante & Teicher LP, it's actually a partial reissue of their stellar 1958 ABC Paramount release ""Heavenly Sounds in Hi-Fi"" (ABCS-221). Though the tracks are reordered, and only 10 of the original 12 are included (missing are ""The Moon Was Yellow"" and ""Stardust""), this is still a nice buy, and the only place these tracks can be found together.1958 saw Ferrante and Teicher still experimenting with the techniques they'd worked on as faculty members at Julliard. Though they'd later reduce their work to slushy two-piano renditions of famous movie themes, in 1958 they were still outside, wedging things into their piano strings and extracting all manner of unusual sounds from their instruments.A very listenable LP, mixing a romantic ambiance with edgy sounds."
3,Okay F&T prepared piano pieces - but...,"Not a bad collection of standards done up in the inimitable F&T pseudoelectronic style, *but*... They omitted the two best songs ('Stardust' and 'The Moon Was Yellow')!!! What were they thinking?!?! It's just as well, I guess. Standards played in this style just don't seem to sound as good as more uptempo melodies like, say, latin music. The stereo version of 'Soundproof' is still much, much better than anything on this album. 'Tico-Tico' and 'Loose Ends Merengue' prove my point."
1,Odd,"""Say uncle"" is one of FEW movies that made me feel uncomfortable, while watching it. There were moments I could easily understand those parents who decided to defend their children (even if it wasn't necessary).I haven't the foggiest if it's the fault of the script or just the way the main character is potrayed, but his obsession with kids seemed to me quite disturbing (sick at some moments).There are however serious issues mentioned in this film, such as: intolerance, false accussations or prejudice and sex stereotypes. Unfortunately the total impression isn't positive.Judge for yourself."
3,slight but sweet,"Although I found the premise of the movie hard to swallow--would an openly gay man who hangs out at the park, works at a children's store and distributes flyers of his ""Manny"" services really be so naive to assume that others would NOT suspect him of pedophilia? Especially in our 21st century/post Michael Jackson world? Childlike himself, Paul floats half an inch above the ground, but he's no stooge.Yet I enjoyed the acting and the photography, and I appreciated the concept of the film. Few people would bat an eyelash at a woman who behaved as Paul did--after all, it's women who staff our day care centers and babysit our kids and teach our elementary students--but a man who wished to do so would be regarded as a perv, even if he really and truly loves children. It's a sad commentary, but as they say, the good suffer for the bad. I look forward to seeing more of Paige's work."
4,Great Message!!,"This movie was not a comedy. What it was is true. There is so much hatred, misunderstanding, and assuming in this world. Peter did a great job, so did Kathy Najimy. If you are open minded you might just love it. Give it a chance. The message is quite strong.Patty R"
2,It could have been better,"I'm a fan of Peter Paige and I really don't want to write a negative review but seriously I just didn't get it. Maybe I don't understand black comedy or whatever this might be called.I can suspend disbelief up to a point. I mean, in what place can a woman claim a man is a pedophile and not be sued for defamation of character. Certainly, mob mentality exists but really, all these women (no men, just women until later in the movie) easily believe such an allegation?While the intent was good, showing how gay does not equal pedophile, I don't think the illustration of it was very good. It frustrated me and made me mad. I didn't laugh. Nor felt happy at the end. If that was Peter Paige's intent then job well done.I think the performances were decent. I just didn't dig the story and how it unfolded."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered two of these soap dispensers and neither one worked! The battery compartment wouldn't stay seated in one and when I could get it seated, the dispenser still wouldn't work. The other one just plain wouldn't work. What a disappointment!"
4,good try but,"This was an effort by me to write a book like Adam Smith's Money Game, or Burton Malkiel's Random Walk down Wall Street. There are still books like that coming out and all of htem are probably better than mine.The last time Ichecked this site, there seemed to have been a nasty review written on one of my other books, referring to the title of this book. I am sure that weas one of my more jealous Tokyo colleagues, who have lived the pampered life all their days. My experience shws me, as there is a fool and a rogue born every minute, there will always be needs for caveat meptor books like this. That is the bad news. The good news is there are pletny of good books out there which are better than my effort. Check them out."
5,Awesome professional foosball table,"This is a great, high quality product. The only issue is the time and complexity of assembly activities, which was probably a couple of hours."
2,Great.....for awhile,"We got this coffee maker 2 years ago and loved it....great tasting coffee and loved the pull out water tank. We really loved the cappuccino side with the milk tank...I do not like to bother to froth milk in a seperate container and this was a great solution.BUT....the clock doesnt keep good time...by HOURS....the clock evens goes on the fritz when I would grind the coffee plugged into the same outlet...had to go to another room (another circuit I suppose?). The frother started leaking at the top of the milk container...spraying steam and milk...have to put that little lid on and clean it all up. Now it started to go dead after brewing coffee...had to unplug and plug back in the next morning and it would work. Now it is completely dead.Oh, and the carafe from the very beginning drips if you dont pour the coffee fairly slow. I expected more durability from $150...made in China I am sure.Still not a perfect replacement choice out there....annoying."
5,"great machine, one major flaw","i have had this machine for about a week now.i am new to ""brewing my own espresso"", but from what i can tell this machine does an excellent job.haven't used the frother yet, so i can't comment on that feature.i do know that it brews great coffee.the major drawback that i see is that the coffee doesn't come out very warm, especially if you are like me and like to add some milk to you coffee. you must drink it in a hurry otherwise it will get cold quick!"
1,Delonghi BCO110,I purchased this product for Christmas. The machine was delivered with a broken Carafe. There was no support from Delonghi after three e-mails and two phone calls. I ended up purchasing a new carafe from a local repair center. Their remarks were parts are not easy to obtain. The milk frother does not deliver at 160 deg F. Foaming was little using 1% and 2% milk. Cleaning was not easy. The coffee side of the machine could be compared to any other Mr. Coffee machine. I have returned the machine and purchased a Capresso 351 with great satisfaction.
2,good for very short time,"This machine makes good coffee, worst espresso but milk frother can be used for short time only. My broke after 3 months and now I am looking for spare part which isn't simple. Also this machine has timer which needs to be set every time you unplug it (could be for a few seconds only). Milk tank is difficult to keep clean because of its complicated shape."
1,Pass on this one,"I bought this machine at Christmas and have had nothing but problems with it. I had to exchange it for a new one because the heater tank and frother wasn't working properly, the coffee was barely warm and the second one had the EXACT same problems. I talked to a dealer at HBC and she informed me MANY of these machines have been returned for the same reason. Delonghi customer service was of absolutely no help and was not interested to know about the problems with this product. I have returned the second machine to the dealer and will probably never by Delonghi products again, regardless of any customer rating."
3,"Delonghi BC0110 Caffe Figaro Espresso,Cappuccino&Coffee Bar","I bought this machine about 2 monthes ago. I use it daily, I love being able to set the timer and have hot ,fresh ,strong coffee ready for me when I get up! I have experienced on a couple of different occasions that there was water that had dripped out all over the counter, but still made coffee, Im not to sure what happened? I have also found that the espresso part of the machine does not brew the coffee as strong as I would like it, regardless of the type of espresso coffee I use. I use skim milk in the frother part and have experienced hot frothy milk, and I havent found it difficult to clean as long as you do it shortly after use. Over all Im pretty happy with the machine but may have expected more for the money!"
1,Not Worth The Price!!!,"Stay away from this one! This is the second model I own since the first one, not even a year old, started leaking all over the place as well as turn on when you weren't even making coffee which is a fire hazard in itself. I thought, okay, maybe I got a lemon. I went through hoops with the company to get another one. Well, I wish I had never bought it in the first place. Although this one does not leak, it still turns on by itself. I have to keep it unplugged so it doesn't start a fire. Definitely not worth the money I spent and will not buy DeLonghi again!"
1,JUNK!!!!!,"This is a piece of JUNK! The steaming tube is to short, needs to be out the side of the machine and longer. The steam from the espresso ruined the clock and controls, it wont turn off and the on light just flashes. The espresso only brews a double shot then steams the last double shot, should brew a quad shot. Stops brewing espresso after double shot, have to manually adjust the richness level knob to get the other double out. Coffee is way to cold! Needs a built in espresso tamper to compress the espresso grinds in the cup for better more efficient brewing. Just an all around space taker on my counter top. Not user friendly!"
2,Breaks too easily,"The espresso maker on this one is awesome. I love the milk frothing mechanism. Mine took the temperature just fine. The coffee maker is fine. It has a water filter and everything. The problem with this model is that it is priced highly but it is cheaply made. The handle to the espresso cup broke within a few months. The swing out coffee filter holder on the coffee part is not designed to come out for cleaning. If you take it out, you will not get it back in without breaking it. I had this thing for about a year and I can't use it anymore because it is falling apart. I'd stay away from this, but try to find an espresso maker with the same features."
3,milk cup problems,great item but the milk holder breaks all the time you'll spend more time looking for the milk holder replacement then using the machine
1,Piece of Junk,"The clock goes off every day. The unit turns itself on randomly, I now keep it unplugged for fear it might be a fire hazzard. Called customer service, they were useless. Would never buy a Delonghi product again."
2,Stopped working after 6 months,"I purchased this coffee maker/espresso machine for some of the same reasons as everyone else. Liked the idea of saving counterspace. Well, the first thing that I noticed is that the (steamed) milk never really did get very hot like a purchased latte. Secondly, after 5-1/2 months, I noticed a little light stayed on near the on switch for making coffee which I didn't think was a big deal until I found the coffee side of the machine's plate was hot and no matter what I pushed, the light wouldn't go off. So, I thought, no big deal I'll just unplug it. Well, then my clock was flashing everytime I went to make coffee and finally returned it for the $$ and looking for another brand. Sorry, don't trust the brand anymore. By the way, Costco was great and said they'd had quite a few returned which means others had bad experiences also."
2,leaking all over counter,This unit leaks all over the counter top. We have had it for a couple of years and now we loose a cup of water onto the counter top each morning. I wouldn't recommend this unit.
4,Great Coffee Maker,"We have had our coffee maker for 1 1/2 years now and have not had any problems with it at all. Program button works well and clean up is simple and easy. It occasionally needs a new replacement water filter, only a couple dollars, and coffee tastes like new again."
2,Good coffee until a piece broke...,"I've had my machine for 7 months (it was the wedding gift I was most thrilled to receive). Unfortunately, it has given me quite a bit of trouble already. My lattes are barely lukewarm, so I have to microwave them every time. The clock light appears only after I unplug and re-plug in the machine. It is a chore to clean the milk container. Coffee grounds come through the expresso part, forcing me to use a small filter. All this I could handle, but then yesterday the little red piece in the milk container broke, leading to a mini-milk explosion during frothing. Now I'm not sure what to do. What will I ever tell my gracious mother-in-law who gave me this lovely gift? If I could go back, I would register for a different machine."
2,DeLonghi Coffee Mill Disappointing,"We are sold on freshly ground coffee so we have a coffee grinder wherever we make coffee. We've had a Braun for years (it still works great after over 20 years but is in a different house) and recently broke a Proctor Silex mill (used for 5 years) and decided to try a new brand. I researched various brands on Amazon to try to find one with which people were pleased. The DeLonghi looked like a favorite but our experience has been disappointing. It has indicator lights which promise to alert you when the coffee has been ground to a specific consistency. However, it grinds inconsistently when ground ""coarse"" and becomes too fine (like powder for espresso) when the indicator designates ""medium"". The top is difficult to get in the right position (which is required before it will grind). Additionally, the top is difficult to pour grinds from without making a mess and losing some of the coffee. It's still working but we're looking for a replacement."
3,c,this is not a fancy grider but does the job. It does not have a automactic shutoff like it shows. You have to check and see if the beans are ground.
1,Design inherently lends itself to being disposable,"The first 10 times I used this grinder, it worked like a charm, like so many poorly made products.Upon the motor burning out at grind 11, opening it up revealed cardboard components (yes, even cheaper than plastic) separating electrical wires, and self threading screws (thus, disposable), clearly this product was never designed to be taken apart and fixed, but rather just thrown away. This also indicates the company has no testing procedure, or they would fall victim to their own self-threading screws upon re-assembly.I also noticed ""Peoples Republic of China"" (PRC) on the inner components. I highly recommend you look into a European made coffee grinder, and pass this disposable piece of junk up."
5,GoJo,"This little giant belongs in every coffee lover's home or apartment. Its main function is grinding coffee beans and its so described, but more about this product.It features a set of three lights that light at different intervals during the grinding process and alerts the coffee lover when his grinds are ready for the coffee pot. Drip, perk, or whatever way you prefer to use the grinds, they are ground to your desired consistency. After a few pots of coffee you will know through experience what produces the perfect cup of coffee.A safety interlock switch prevents the coffee grinder operation until such time the cover is locked in place and a retractable windup power cord makes the unit easier to store or display on a counter top.This unit I purchased is a replacement for the same make and model I have owned and joyfully used for over five years. When wear and tear does its dirty deed, I will replace it again with an exact replacement. Recommendation from a coffee lover, GET ONE!"
3,"Great, except for the lid/switch...","I received this as a gift from a coffee aficionado (I'm NOT). I don't use it very often, but after about 6 uses it's become a little tempermental. If the lid is on ALL THE WAY, it won't grind. Seems to be a problem with the lid/switch connection -- if I turn the lid back just a little bit, it powers up. Pain in the ***, but gets the job done. Hopefully they'll fix this glitch on future models..."
1,BAD BAD BAD,DeLonghi is not what it used to be. I owned this product for a month before it stopped working. The grind selector never worked from day one. I loved DeLonghi products but recently one of their toaster ovens stopped working after only six months (did I mention I'm a maintenance freak). Sorry DeLonghi time to move on.
4,A good value and a good grinder!,"We have had our Delonghi since 2004 and it has worked great for the whole time - until last Sunday. It was overloaded in order to make a big batch and the motor burned out. Our fault, not the grinder's. I would recommend this grinder to any one but the most elitist among the coffee ""connoisseurs"" who wouldn't be happy unless they spent $100+."
3,Okay for the price.,"The silver portion of the finish is paint, not stainless steel.The lights are meaningless...essentially timers.Cord retractor is great."
2,was grand for a very short time,"This item, affectionately named R2D2, worked like a champ with all the bells and whistles, well, actually lights and dials for about 5 weeks and then just stopped. ... Thus I'm profoundly disappointed - and now without any grinder. In fact, given its short life, the 2 star rating is incredibly generous."
1,Not a good item,Item worked for 1 minute before breaking. Very difficult to get the correct grind. Definitely an item to keep away from. Am returning as defective.
1,It never worked and I had destroyed the box to return it,It never work big paper weight I destroyed the box so I couldn't return it. I will never by a grinder again off the internet. They are not reliable you need a face and a place to return them. I have learned my lesson. I was a big internet purchaser this grinder and a the WORKS GT have taught me a lesson.
4,Kids Enjoy,Koala Brothers bendable figures are made very well and are able to be easily handled by all of my children. My children enjoy the program and have enjoyed creating their own adventures with these characters from the show.
5,it's great,"This thing is a neat charger. I'm not sure what it does but it adjusts the current as it charges. You can see the current being adjusted on the LED screen so it's kind of interesting. And it beeps and says ""FUL"" when it's done charging. It somehow knows when the battery is full. And if your batteries are only partially drained, it usually only takes about 30 min to top them off. I love this charger. The alligator clips are just the right size for a small 12v 8ah battery (6lb). I was worried that the alligator clips might be too big but they work just right for my small battery. The seller got the product to me about 4 days before the delivery estimate so they get it out to you very fast. A good experience overall."
5,VECTOR 1089A Battery charger,My Vector chargers are used in the harsh marine climate of the Bahamas. It is easy to use on the different types of batteries I have. It is great for extending the life of the batteries. A 5 year warrenty!! From the small battery of the Polaris ranger to the large battery on the back-up generator it is unequaled.
2,War Live,"First live DVD I have seen of War. I was excited when I picked it up but skeptical at the same time. Picture quality is low, soft image but pro shot. Audio is mono with no treble. This DVD looks like it was recorded from a boot tape to DVD. Save your money unless you are that deep into War."
4,Good for the professional new to rainmaking,"This is a very good book, particularly as a general introduction to the basic concepts and strategies. I thought some of the subjects received pretty sketchy treatment, and you might want to look to other books to supplement. But very good overall."
5,Common Sense positive approach to relationship-building,A common sense approach to what holds us back from realizing our marketing potential. Mr. Maraia makes it fun to change our attitude from fear of rejection to the satisfaction of helping others and building lifelong relationships.
5,RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AT ITS PRACTICAL BEST,This book contanins a practical detailed approcah to building relationships with all customer regardless of your business. The author offers easy steps to make rainmaking simple yet practical.
4,"Nice glass, looks great, welding is ""eh""","These really look great. My only complaint - where the stake attaches to the body of the bug. A bolt is welded to the body. Poorly. One was lose. One was broken 1/2 off. They still worked, but are loose. The connection is pretty flimsy - almost paper thin copper.Followup: It's been several months and these things have held up really well - even survived the Chicago winter outside!"
5,Interior Designer SHOCKED at the elegance of the Dragonflies,"I hesitated ordering the Dragonflies, as I thought they were no more than a lawn decoration, similiar to a pink flamingo. I sent these as a gift and when I saw them, I was extremely impressed. They are beautiful, elegant and have a expensive and classy appearance. Don't hesitate to order these, I feel you will all be very pleased with this purchase !!!"
4,My spouse felt that the after shave had ...,"My spouse felt that the after shave had a clean, masculine scent. It felt refreshing after he applied it to his face. He didn't find any disadvantages, and has used Brut products in the past and been satisfied. If asked, he states that he'd recommend the product to friends or family, but would otherwise not volunteer the information."
3,"A masculine smell that's enjoyable, but it smells ...","A masculine smell that's enjoyable, but it smells like cologne that you spent under $10 for. A nice change of pace from my normal cologne. I'd recommend Brut if you want a clean masculine smell, and don't want to spend a lot of money on a fragrance."
4,What I like most about the product is ...,"What I like most about the product is the fact that once applied, the scent remains much longer than any other after shave lotion I've used. My wife noticed it the very first time I used it and she liked the smell. At first I didn't like the aroma, because it was new to me (I've been an Old Spice user for over 40 years), but after using it a few times, I found it very refreshing and longer lasting."
4,My kitties love these,"For anyone who has a cat and would like for them to have a little bit better smelling breath, buy these. Not only do they make their breath smell better but they go absolutely crazy over them."
3,Cat liked them briefly; now ignores them,"The cat loved these initially, but soon lost interest, so I'll give them less frequently. She actually prefers her dry Iams cat food to these."
3,Buyer Be Aware!,"This video only has TWO shows on it and is NOT a ""Season One"" type DVD. I bought this for my father for Christmas thinking the latter and while I will still give it to him and he will still enjoy it, when I paid for it, I expected it to be a ""Season""-type DVD. Not so!"
2,Not what I expected,"I expected more than 2 episodes to be on the DVD. I thought I was buying a season 1 DVD for a Christmas gift. I am sure that my mother-in-law will enjoy it, but for the price I really expected more."
5,color me khaki,"This fast paced book will have you turning the pages. It is so well written, I felt like I was right there, in the jungles with the POW. Wow! This is a terrific read!!"
2,Kind of cheap,The case is cheap...the the tools are bendy...but they get the job done. Still if you prefer quality go to a store and buy some real BBQ tools.
3,Interesting but could be better,"The book has superb photographs, both black and white and color.The extended discussion of the attempts to establish what ammonite biology might have been like by comparing them with living and dead realative was fascinating.On the negative side, I missed any discussion of the human context of ammonites. When were they first noticed? What was the process of ascertaining what they really were? As a non-specialist, I could have done with less information on the history and details of various species.Overall, while worth reading, this book suffers in comparison with Richart Fortley's book Trilobite."
1,Extra Features Are Inaccurate and Not Worth The Money,"As a compass, this unit appears to function properly. The additional features are a waste of money. The altimeter must constantly be adjusted (During the course of a drive from to NY to VT, it will be off by several hundred feet). If the car is turned off, the altimeter must be recalibrated. The Weather Predictor has always said SUN... never anything else. I made the mistake of hardwiring the power cable to my 12Volt power port myself (not purchasing the PNI wiring kit). This voided my warranty, and I could not return the unit. I wired it 2 months after I bought the unit, the problems were always there."
2,Not Reliable,"I found this compass disappointing. As a sailor I am use to the accuracy of Loran, GPS and marine compasses. I suspect that the problem is not the instrument itself, but the difficulty of compensating for the magnetic influences in a car. The PNI often gives erroneous directional information. My unit has developed a defect after less than 6 months of infrequent use. The 'off' button doesn't work. The unit eventually turns itself off. It is an interesting gadget, but a good road map is a better value."
2,This is not made for Minnesota winters!,"I didn't find this compass difficult to set up. All was fine until we had a cold winter day in Minnesota. As soon as the temperature got below 10 degrees, the suction cups fell off the windshield. I was very annoyed when the temperature readout flashed ""below 0"" instead of telling me how much below zero it was. Living in a cold climate, it's important to know whether it is -1 or -25."
1,Waist of money,This item is a waste of money. You can get the same benifets by reading the elv. signs in the mountains.It will keep a good compas heading but that is all.
2,Review of V7000 Wayfinder,"After reading the reviews, I decided to take the chance and purchase the above unit for my car. Unfortunately, after calibration and adjustment for local declination, the compass was off 45-60 degrees when compared to known reference points. Recalibration did not change the accuracy. Since then, I purchased a traditional spirit compass which after installing and compensating in the same vehicle performs accurately."
4,Great Features and Display,"I have had other PNI compasses for the car but this one is the best. It has a great display and the calibration was a breeze. The barometer and altimeter are a bit unstable but what do you expect when you are using it in a moving vehicle. I also purchased the hard wire kit from PNI which is fantastic. Once wired, it automatically turns the unit on when you start the car and turns on the backlight at night. I wired it right into the wiring of the 12V power outlet and it works fine."
1,Wasn't built for vehicle use!,"Bought this almost 2 years ago and it is still in my car but not for long! The compass just went out, which was the only thing that worked reliably. Don't let the Temperature, Altimeter, Weather gauge features dazzle you into buying this one. NONE OF THEM WORKED ""ACCURATELY"" AS ADVERTISED at the time with exception of the compass. The notion of constantly having to ""adjust"" anything is ridiculous especially if the device supposedly was design and engineered for automotive use! You should be able to set it one time and not have to worry about it unless the device loses power. If you need a compass then get just that from PNI line of products. The rest of the features are just a marketing ploy to get you to dish out more money. This product was really not made for automotive use!"
2,Keep looking...,"I found this item too unreliable for what I want, and had to constantly adjust it too."
1,Wayfindr Compass,"This item is not worth the money spent. I was looking to replace a manufacturer installed compass when I got a new vehicle-I found the directions difficult and the unit way too sensitive to temperature changes-also the suction cup mount was constantly coming off, requiring recalibration. I don't know about most people, but I can't be bothered removing the unit each time the temperature fluctuates above or below the specs. Save yourself the aggravation and pay considerably more for a GPS! (Which is what I currently use.)"
1,Total Trash,"Awful engineering, doesn't work as promised. Stay away from the trash made by this company."
4,A jarring emotional experience,"This movie is worth watching and I'm very much glad that I did. The plot and ending are extremely moving and is a great exploration into relationships of varying kinds vs. how we feel we should satisfy ourselves. Although the main character is gay, this is not a central theme of the film, the ideas portrayed here are applicable with anyone. I didn't give the movie 5 stars because of some unanswered issues in the storyline, which could be seen as part of the plot, but overall very well done. Again, I very much enjoyed this film and recommend it."
5,"beauty, not death","i feel this flick is about beauty, ultimately: else, why would francois choose melvil poupaud, one of the most etherially beautiful men in cinema, to play the lead? only eduardo norriega is comparable. the beauty of choices, the beauty of dying with one's dignity intact (even if that means dying alone), the beauty of real relationships, the beauty of one's home (whether that be a place or a state of mind).one of the crew members in the featurette described melvil as looking like christ: when he is skeletally thin and shorn of his lovely, curly locks, his beauty is not diminished, just changed -- it is ethereal, unearthly, preternatural. very like the achingly, exquisite beauty of the christ of the pieta. here is a beauty which is both cerebral and visceral; no escape from it's power. there is no escape from the power of this film, either; it latches on and does not let go. take the ride; you shall not regret the time spent in such beauty with such exalted company."
1,Disappointed!,"I'm sure the subject content is good, but I haven't seen it. I reordered the correct cd version from another supplier and had the replacement delivered. My dissappointment is with JJoyBooks; this was a Christmas present ordered in error for someone out of state. I have requested return and credit info three times through Amazon with no response from JJoyBooks."
5,A Great Series for a Great City,"Though there are many older cities than New York, in the (relatively) short time of its existence, no city has captured the imagination, desire, love, and even hatred, that New York City has. Ric Burns has captured all of these emotions and more in this, one of the finest documentaries ever put on film.The series traces the history of NYC from its earliest days as a Dutch trading post through 2000 (an additional volume was produced after the September 11th terrorist attack). Using interviews, stories, & archival material (prints, paintings, photographs, and old silent films), Burns pulls the viewer in to the life of all types of New Yorkers through the last 300+ years."
5,Does anyone know the name of the opening piece played by Episode 5: Cosmopolis(1919 - 1931)?,Does anyone know the name of the opening piece played by Episode 5: Cosmopolis(1919 - 1931)?This is the part the F Scott Fitzgerald voiceIt's a great documentary with great music.
1,Dont buy,This book was a disapointment. I typically find somthing usefull from any d20 book and have somthing good to say. I havent used this book once and i dont allow this book in any of my games. It is confusing and poor in quality. I bought this book for less than 5 dollers and wish i had saved my money. If you want to run a western game or your looking for a west book get Dead lands d20 or d20 modern/past. This book is not worth buying.
4,Magick afoot,"I picked this book up on a whim at a book fair. I was enormously lucky to find four such gifted story tellers together in one book. This book is a must for those who love the Ireland of yore. This was one of those books I read cover to cover in one sitting. After each story, I was worried that the next would be a disappointment, but that never happened. These tales weave together to give you a sense of Irish Magick as its best."
4,Wow,"Wow. Prior to reading ORION, I was never a big fan with science fiction. Now, after reading it, I find my mind enthralled with the different aspects of sci-fi."
2,"A Good Read, But . . .","Bova is, without a doubt, a talented writer. Every book of his that I have read has been engrossing, quickly drawing the reader in. Orion is no exception, transporting the reader from such extremes as Saturn's moons to a glacier-covered prehistoric Earth. If you simply sit back and let's Bova take you on his ride, Orion can be enjoyable, but, like an A&E Biography on cable, it regards itself as a more serious work than it is. Ostensibly, Bova is trying to talk about the nature of humanity itself, our origins and our development. With such a profound topic, one would expect grand insights. Instead, we end up with a pot-boiler plot with a somewhat hackneyed conclusion. Ultimately, Orion ends up being nothing more than mindless entertainment. Satisfactory for a Star Trek novel, but a let-down from Bova."
3,jacket summary,"from the back cover of the April 1985 Tor paperback edition:cover art by Boris VallejoJohn O'Ryan is not a god...not exactly. He is an eternal warrior destined to combat the Dark Lord through all time for dominion of the Earth. Follow him, servant of a great race, as he battles his enemy down the halls of time, from the caves of our ancestors to the final confrontation under the hammer of nuclear annihilation."
1,Long remembered,"To be truthful,,,,if you can stand you hair smelling dirty the moment you use this than it will hold your hair, but at what price?This has been around a long time but as there are many other products around that do the same thing and don't STINK.Vitalis, Clubman etc...."
1,I haven't received this item yet.,"It was supposed to have shipped July 15 - UPS 2nd day but, it's the 27th now and UPS still hasn't been contacted to pick it up and, if that's not frustrating enough, I can't find an Amazon customer service email address to make an inquiry to."
5,Overlooked,"I too realize my debt to these extraordinary women -- and Ken Burns for exhuming this hidden history.Reading it does not compare to this meaningful DVD, now on my Xmas list to edify my three grown daughters."
3,The different paths of Stanton and Anthony,"Very informational. The DVD focused not only on the women's suffrage movement but also Anthony and Stanton's friendship. The documentary also showed how as Anthony got older she became more focused on one outcome (the votes of women) while Stanton became focused on many woman's rights issues. It shows some hard decisions that the two had to make separately regarding the missions they have given their lives to and staying true to their friendship. Susan B. Anthony wholeheartedly gave her life, her breath, her everything to making the women's vote possible. This was a well done documentary."
1,"this is the bottom people, right here, and I found it","Don't let the ""true story"" on the cover fool you. This is about as real as professional wrestling. If it was even remotely true everyone in Africa would be a half-caste (form being bitten) Its very generic. It has a blair witch feel to it, although, not even that good. Terrible movie. Poor editing (maybe on purpose) but most of all its boring. I literally got so bored I was getting sleepy, so I decided to skim the dvd chapters, and you can test this if you like, the majority of the chapters have the same 6-8 people sitting around a table, talking!! That's the whole movie....go ahead, skip ahead....no death, at least not before I shut it off! On my top 10 worst list. The people that made this should be dragged out onto the street and stoned"
1,Oh What a Stinker,"I actually bought this movie because I am always on the lookout for good under-rated horror. Boy did I get hosed.This movie has absolutely no redeeming value. The camera work is a joke. The plot is so full of holes and unrealistic dialogue you could drive a truck through it. The ""special effects,"" and I am being very generous giving them that term, look like a pre-film school student did them. The characters are little more than cliches'. The movie had a little bit of MTV's Wild Boyz to it, but only a little, and it was the worst part of that not-do-great show.I beg you, please don't waste your money!"
1,MAKE IT END! MAKE IT END!!! AHHHHHHHHHH!,"This movie sucks. Plain and simple. If there is any other movie in the store... ANY OTHER MOVIE, get it instead...This is a hard review to write, because I can normally find one or two things in any movie (no matter how bad) that I like. Take Redneck Zombies for instance. Bad movie, but some funny stuff in it.Half-Caste is really bad.Imagine the worst reality TV show out there, add a little bit of horror, surrounded by a lot of stupid subplots... and stupid shots...The true horror of this movie is when you eventually drag yourself to the end of it, and you turn back and realize how much time in your life you just lost and you'll never be able to get it back again... AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"
1,Tried twice and it broke down in less than 1 month!!!,"This machine makes a great cappuccino. I was very happy at first making several cups a day... Until it blew up (literally, almost) and stopped making steam.I tried again (Seeing that half the reviews were good and half were bad I figured I'd try my luck)...What a surprise... The second one broke in exactly the same way in less than 3 weeks (I had guests over too, so I was very upset).Bottom line, I returned it and purchased a breville, which does not make as good a coffee, but I hope it will be more reliable..."
3,annoyed,"I decided to upgrade my esspresso machine to the DeLonghi. After working out the ok light, I was good to go. The main problem I have with my machine is the frother leaks - the whole time the machine is on. I have to keep a towel under the wand. I don't care for the knob used to control the frother either. I'm also having trouble getting the filter clean enough to drip the coffee. Sometimes it flows just fine other times (like this morning grrr) it just drips one drop at a time. If I can figure out why the filter clogs up I'll be a happy camper.I wondered how long ago I bought this machine and went looking for my review. This week I've replaced it with a gaggia. The delonghi continued to leak, with the leak turning into a fine stream that a towel was no longer enough to contain. It did give me great service, and what I thought was pretty good espresso shots."
4,don't listen to the naysayers,"I just bought the BAR42E with fear and trembling after reading all the negative reviews about ""not hot enough,"" ""too complicated,"" ""leaky,"" and on and on. I bought mine at the right price ($149.99 at Bloomingdales) and it works great. Nice and hot, good crema, great flavor. It beats the hell out of my 20 year old Krups steamer and it looks George Jetson cool, too. If you want a step up from basic espresso makers and some Italian style, you won't regret this Delonghi."
1,The most unreliable appliance I've ever owned,"...and I have been using home espresso machines since 1983. I returned two units to Amazon, and my third is going to the shop now (Amazon will no longer exchange, because this one broke on day 60 - 30 days after their store warranty). Where do I start? All three machines leaked water from the base while you were steaming coffee. The pump broke on the third, so it only brews your coffee and then cannot steam your milk.I will never buy another deLonghi product."
4,Cappuccino Made Easy- This is the machine for you!!!,"I've used quite a few espresso machines over the years (stovetop, Krups, combo coffee/espresso) and had quite the adventures steaming milk. I wish I would have purchased this machine sooner- it makes the entire process of cappuccino easier than I thought - especially after reading the speciality coffee sites!!! The machine washes very easily, heats up the water quickly (5 minutes tops), steams milk way better than anything I have used (or watched used at the coffee shops), and is a cinch to use the pods (way easier to clean up!). No leaking found, taste and crema is the same as coffee shops, and I can have a cuppa whenever I wanna!!!"
4,Nice product but it has some problems,"Overall, I like this product. It's performance is very good, and its espresso coffee is wonderful. However, the licking problem reduce 1 star."
1,Do Not Buy This!,"You'd be better off trying to make your own espresso machine from twigs, an old shoe, and some duct tape. It would be eaiser to use, produce better results, and it wouldn't cost you $200.Seriously- it's loud, it leaks, the directions are indecipherable. As a comparison, I also have a $50 Krups machine that works far, far better.The only thing good about the DeLonghi is its aesthetics."
2,A greatly abrigdged and redacted version of the platform sutra,"We began using this text in our Buddhist Sutra Study group only to find that this translation is missing so much of the text it is almost impossible to compare it to other translations. It may have been that the translator was working off a fragmentary text but most of the Sutra is missing from this translation. If you are looking for a full translation, you should likely be looking at one of the many other excellent full translations either on amazon or elsewhere online."
5,"Exceptional translation and close reading of one of the most important and useful documents in Buddhism, regardless of lineage","Yampolsky was a professor in Eastern Studies at Columbia and his translations of Chinese and Japanese Chan and Zen texts are superior. More neutral in presentation than the more recent translation by Red Pine (Bill Porter) who takes a more personal and idiosymcratic view point toward translation, both works are excellent and illuminate one another.This work is a particular favorite of mine. I give this translation my highest rating."
4,"Not for the ""Easily Offended""","Again, Louisiana is represented in the Hip Hop realm. Lil Boosie and Weebie's ""Gangsta Musik"" is hard core. Two of my favorites on this album are: Swerve and Bad B_t_h. If you are looking to hear correct grammar and familiar beats then this is not the album for you. However, if you would like to hear truth enunciated in slang with a slammin baseline then this album is it. Needless to say this album is not for the easily offended. Excellent!"
5,Tiiight Sh****T!!!!!,Tightest Beats & lyrics in a minute. Real hooks a real Gee can relate 2. It's a must have 4 real Gangsta Muzik
1,who is this wack F&%k Webbie???,"September 6, 1985, a southern wannabe cancer to hip hop culture was born. and 19 years later he enters the rap game with wack music, wannabe gangster, thinks rapping about hoes, sex, and bi*ches is new. garbage pure garbage. the south has sum really wack rappers out there, what happen in the past where there were only a couple of southern rappers and they knew how to make music? only a couple such as Ludacris, Scarface, No Limit, and Cash Money. now everyone from the south wants to jump on the bandwagon and rip off each other. dont support webbie hes pure Trash, ill tell it to his face he aint &%$# but a faker."
1,Garbage Music,"These two are just wack. Period. How does Webbie preech about being a thug and wears pretty boy collard tee's in his video. And people are supposed to take him seriously? I just laugh when I see him. To me he really sucks. Him and Fruity make straight garbage music. All of you who read these reviews and expected to see good reviews, yall are brainless and have no taste in music. All yall been brainwashed to buy ""Garbage Music"" That means Yall are dumb and boaring.Holla: K. Locster"
4,A little less than Ghost. (book1),"More killing, more sex, but a little harder to believe. I enjoyed the book. Sex slaves, harem, dbsm, weapons, tactics? Hell yes. It's got it all."
3,Good Read and Better than Ghost,"Good Story and a bit less over the top than Ghost. I would probably recommend this book over Ghost just because it is a better read. The Sex is still there but less in your face than in the first.If you are a Ringo fan as I am and were put off by Ghost, read this one. Remember it is still in the Mac Bolan, The Destroyer and as someone else mentioned John Carter (Except no Mars)"
1,A great dissapointment,"When I can figure out which John Ringo book goes with what series and in what order I'll buy it. Any of John Ringo's books were a must read right up until I read Kildar.This was the first of the ""Ghost"" series books that I bought and was bored to tears after wading through three quarters of a book filled with the hero's sexual exploits. Yes, the sociology is fascinating and Mr. Ringo's characters are almost up to his usual high standards but almost isn't what I spend my money for.I'm no prude and enjoy a bit of titillation as much as the next reader but I I wanted porn I'd hit the XXXX book store up the street and if I wanted formula plotting I'd stick with Clive Cussler and Pitt where I can predict just what is going to happen next throughout the book.No more Kildars for me this one soured my taste for the series. I'll just go back to trying to sort out what John Ringo's prolific titles go with which series and in what order."
5,kildar kicks @ss,of course im alittle bias since john ringo wrote it since i love his books but kildar is great i was alittle leary since ghost wasnt that great at first but i was pleased to no end a great book with eqal parts humor and action and john ringos usual style a must read for anyone
5,GREAT READ,"NONE STOP ACTION,HUMOR,VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN,MORE ADULT AND THAT IS REALLY GOOD FOR THIS STORY LINE!"
2,A tribute to the Gor (not gore) novels,"In the late 1960's, John Norman began a long series of fantasy novels about an alternate Earth called Gor where women were subservient sex slaves of muscle-bound warrior males. This pimple-faced, adolescent geek (we weren't called that then. Losers maybe) read every one. Then I lost my pimples, started making it with real women -- attractive usually, but not would-be fashion models -- and learned that Mr. Norman was writing about criminal behavior unacceptable in modern western society.John Ringo acknowledges his debt to the Gor novels in passing, and well he should. Read this series if you want some decent military action and some testosterone drenched illicit sex with underage captive girls. Don't show it to your western female significant other, if you want her to think well of you.Oh, it's not Science Fiction OR fantasy in the literary sense. It's an action and sex novel and probably shouldn't be in this section of Amazon."
1,Too much Sex!,"Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote ""alternative"" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger."
5,The Ghost decides to come out of retirement - with dangerous results.,"John Ringo's KILDAR tells of Mike, who has always wanted to be a SEAL, but who is currently hated by every terrorist on Earth and many governments. Facing danger, the Ghost decides to come out of retirement - with dangerous results."
3,"Kildar- Less killing, less rape, less action, but OK as long as it's going somewhere.","Just finished Kildar. John Ringo is a good author, and I generally enjoy his books.The first book of the Paladin of Shadows series, 'Ghost', was oddly enjoyable, a forbidden pleasure. Whatever you could say about it, it had action.This book was 400 pages of shopping, followed by 5 pages of shooting, and then it was over. Obviously, this story was intended to be the setup towards something happening later in the series. It was the construction of Mike's personal army. It had some similarity to the ""March to the Sea/Stars"" books with regard to training indigenous folks to be ""modern warrior/soldiers"" but that's to be expected.The mystery of the Keldara was interesting as a diversion, but by and large I found myself saying, ""OK, when is Mike going to kill some people and rape their women?""It's going to be necessary to read this to continue the series, but I sure hope the next books have more fun and less planning."
1,Wont work on a Tungsten either,"For some reason, the game controls dont work on my Tungsten. Would have been cool - but since there is no support for the game, I guess it will have to get returned."
1,Won't work on the Zire 71,What a waste of money! Yes it will load. It has great graphics. But you can't control the games. Instructions are almost worthless. They are written as if you are using a joy stick.
1,to another reviewer,"Marpa? Andrew Cohen is a contemporary Marpa?!Oh, you got me. For a minute, I thought you were serious."
3,Not the whole story,"Andre does not really say how the members created the mess, and they still do as poster yamahavas from Colorado does with the promotion of a censored blog. The real blog story is available fromhttp://what-enlightenment-uncensored.blogspot.com/"
1,"""Still confused about Andrew"" Is Clearly An Ill DC Woman","I bought this book from Amazon last year, never intending to write a review until I was surfing Amazon and seen this review.As if I cannot say something nice I try not to say anything at all. But the review below cought my eye. This book is fair at best. I seen it mostly as a cult leaders ideology, and actually chucked it in the trash.With that said the lady who wrote the review ""Still Confused About Andrew,"" appears to be a bit deranged, and a stalker. As she states she had followed this man across the world in a ""Blissful"" state at times. If I were close to this author I believe I would be contacting the FBI who handles stalkers and such. If you know this lady, she clearly needs some serious mental evaluation. It is scary to think about such people even walking amongst us."
4,Teh Win!,"I have to start by admitting that I have not read this series in a while. In fact, it has been over a decade since I've first read this series. As a kid I thought these books were great. Over the years, I've read other books and never thought back on the series.Currently there is a television series on ABC entitled ""LOST"". Wow! Is it a hit! After first hearing about the series, I thought nothing of it, but after having watched a few episodes I was reminded of Coleman's ""Escape from Lost Island"" series.This series really is a great read. It was good enough to still be in my mind after more than a decade.I recommend this series to all those teens (and adults too) that are interested in the ""LOST"" television series. There are enough differences to keep the two from being spoilers to each other.Seriously good read."
1,Burned out after 6 months,"My wife's parents had a DeLonghi convection oven, which has lasted them for years with heavy use. So, we thought we were making a good purchase. After six months of light usage (mostly for toasting), a strong electrical smell began to eminate from the oven. We now have to send it to a ""local"" service area (about 300 miles from home) and have no idea whether it can be fixed, at what cost or whether DeLonghi will simply replace it. In the meantime, we are without our convection oven for some unknown period of time. We suggest you try a more reliable brand."
4,"I like it ,but----","This is my 3th DeLonghi convection toaster oven.The previous 2 models had bent heating bars after 2 years.This model is different from the others,so we will see.I still like it much better than the other brands.This model has more steps to take and takes some getting used to.Works great when you are"
3,so-so,"I have used this oven exclusively for three years. Perhaps that is the problem. But I have has the mysterious element bending problem--the bottom ones stopped working. Also, even when the elements were all working, food did not cook evenly. The idea of using both racks for two trays of cookies is goofy. Only one of the levels really gets cooked. The pans are cheepy too. I don't use them. I give this oven three stars because I have used it almost everyday for both toasting and cooking (I don't have a regular oven or a toaster)for three and a half years, and it didn't break until six months ago."
3,Bending Element Signals the End of Each Delonghi Oven,"I've had Delonghi toaster ovens for years. I buy them because they're very roomy inside and versatile. The only reason I end up throwing them out is because one (or both) of the heating elements starts to bend to such a degree that I can't get the rack in our out. The digital model has a quirky and most annoying feature: When you set it to Bake the top element goes on periodically, burning the tops of your cakes. Other than these problems, it works fine. However, if I knew of another large capacity toaster oven, I'd been happy to end my relationship with Delonghi. Buyer beware."
2,Slipshod Manufacturing,"The DeLonghi toaster/covection oven is not well or sturdily made. I purchased the digital oven so that I do not have the problem with knobs falling off or breaking but the shelves are such a tight fit that they are virtually impossible to pull out once in place. This can make for nasty burns when the oven is hot. The instruction booklet that accompanies the device is inadequate and I also received included parts for which there was neither explanation nor evident purpose. I am disappointed in myself that I spent so much money for an oven that I will probably employ only as a toaster, and one that is unsatisfactory to use."
3,Disappointed in DeLonghi,"Okay, so I bought an older model off of Amazon about three years ago now. About a year ago the door stopped shutting all the way, one of the elements is totally bent for some reason and recently the knob just broke off. Now it's set on bake forever. I used this oven a lot but I'm very disappointed that it only lasted a few years. I'm leary about spending a lot of money again and buying the newer model- although I'm glad it's digital- no knobs to break off but what about the door problem? From close inspection in the store it looks exactly the same as the older model they've had problems with. I think I'll look for a less expensive convection/toaster oven that way I won't feel the same pain when it only lasts a few years. What am I suppose to do with this old oven, throw it in the landfill?"
3,I liked my older model better!,I'm not crazy about this model. Williams-Sonoma gave me this one when my old delonghi broke--actually it was the door--it wouldn't close which they said had happened to a few others. The cooking is ok but the digital controls drive me nuts--the clock is always needing to be reprogrammed. I don't know if we're hitting the clock button by mistake but it seems to be consistently the wrong time. I also have to watch the toast since the first one tends to burn.
4,One year later,"For most purposes this little box has replace our large oven. As advertized it does cook faster and you need to lower the temp. about 25 degrees. Pies, turkeys, chickens, and Souffles I still do in the large oven but cookies, tarts, cornbread (8""x8""), casseroles, fish, burgers, and NY Strip all do very well in this Delonghi. Great for preparing hors d'oeuvres, esp. when you have guests and need a second oven.The only odd thing is that it will randomly reset the clock to --:--"
1,"Works great, breaks easily","This is our second DeLonghi convection/toaster oven. The first one broke (I forget what happened) but we assumed it was a fluke, so I went and bought another one. These ovens work wonderfully - for as long as they DO work. However, my second one is now broken: the element is bent, and it is emitting a bad electrical smell. Frankly, having read that other reviewers say that the elements bent on their ovens, too, I must assume that this is in intrinsic flaw in these ovens, and I will NOT be buying another DeLonghi. Time to research other models, since I do love the convenience of a countertop oven."
3,Slight Improvement Over Puppet Master 4,"Puppet Master 5 is a slight improvement over Puppet Master 4, but it's not enough. Just like Part 4, Part 5 is style over substance. After finishing watching the movie, I felt like I hadn't even watched a movie. It's not bad, it's not good. It's just there to watch and forget about it ten minutes later. I did like Duane Whitaker, though. He supplied some much needed humor to this installment."
1,Riddled with inaccuracies,"Quote from the movie: ""Western Allies fulfilled their promise to Poland by declaring a war (sic!)on Germany in September, 1939"". Yeah, I guess it's hard to get all the history ""right"" when you try to cram 30 years of history into 110 minutes of footage... For more errors in this movie see the review by Candace Scott. Strange selection of scenes, not always matched to the narrative, completes my list of reasons for 1 star rating of this movie."
1,Sensationalist Propaganda,"In this Irwin Leiser production, interesting rarely-seen newsreel footage is marred by extremely hostile anti-National Socialist commentary. Many of their facts are wrong and other inconvenient historical aspects are completely ignored to fit their political agenda. (Sound familiar?) The reconstructed scenes with a Hitler look-alike from the ""Hitler"" bonus feature gave me a good laugh, but unless you have money to burn (and a mute feature on your TV), I recommend just renting this one--or skipping it altogether--until a more objective documentary becomes available."
1,Poor Quality,This is one of the worst WW2 documentaries Ive seen. It is dated and the video quality is very poor.
3,Low Quality but...,"The footage is great, and for that reason I have to give it three stars. What we really have here is a series of documentaries that were sewn together forty years ago in the hopes of fabricating a coherent whole. Well, it isn't very coherent as we move through the 12 year nightmare sequence again and again. We see Hitler and the Reich die and get resurrected continuously, but some of the photography was unknown to me and may not have been seen elsewhere by other students of history. Mein Kampf's uniqueness and its rare archive material make it valuable. Something that heightens our knowledge base allows us to tolerate the terrible sound quality and its choppy, irregular narrative flow."
2,Go for Kubrick instead,"Lyne's version is incredibly faithful to Nabokov's book in almost every way than Kubrick's. It gets the look of the Forties right, it details Nabokov's fascination with American pop culture beautifully, and Dominique Swain was closer to Lolita's actual age than Sue Lyon was when the earlier version was filled......and yet there's hardly a moment of humor in the whole thing. You'd thing it was based on the dreariest, drabbest, most grim novel in the whole world if you hadn't read the book it was based on. For all of the faults that many (including Nabokov himself) had with the Kubrick version, at least it recaptured what may be perhaps the single funniest great novel of the twentieth century. Lyne's version does not.And Melanie Griffith does not hold a CANDLE to Shelley Winters as Charlotte Haze!"
5,This is great!,"I love this album so much. I cannot see why this is called dance while the drivel put out by Lohan and Spears and the like is called mainstream.This album is wonderful! The lyrics are poigniant, and the beats actually make me want to boogie!HOME is an album that is good value for money. This isn't an album where the singles are good and the rest is throw away.Every track here could be a hit single!"
5,Great for Baby Eczema,My 3 month old was diagnosed with baby eczema. My pediatrician told me to rub her with olive oil every night and eventually she would grow out of it. I did a bunch of research online and read a lot of parent recommendations using this product. I bought some and within a week her little red patches had completely cleared. I also stopped using soap when bathing her and changed her laundry detergent to one that was dye and fragrance free. I have been using this lotion for almost three months now and she hasn't had another break out since.
5,"When all the other creams fail, there's Aquaphor","This stuff is the ""superman"" of diaper creams. It works great for allergic rashes and antibiotic rashes. Throw away all the big name brands and get this. I use this on my son after a bath to seal in moisture and seal out irritants. Between diaper changes or with a mild rash i use Weleda. Between the two, my baby's skin is well protected."
5,great for burns,"My daughter owns a restaurant and frequently suffers burns. Her dermatologist recommended Aquaphor. It helps the burns heal quickly and without scarring, and now I use it too, for burns, dry skin,, dry lips, and general skin care. This product fulfills its promises."
5,"Awesome stuff, really.","Alright, so I've had an infected nose piercing for awhile, I was even using stuff my boyfriend got recommended from his doctor, for piercings specifically, and it wasn't really cutting it. While at the hospital, my mom grabbed some Aquaphor and gave it to me. After about two days of actually applying the ointment, the infection started going down a very noticeable amount. Give or take a day or so and it'll probably be healed. I don't review products often, but this stuff rocks."
1,Very expensive petroleum jelly,"I purchased this product, at the recommendation of a doctor, without checking the ingredients. When I DID check the ingredients, I found that THE ONLY ACTIVE INGREDIENT LISTED IS PETROLATUM (41%). Petrolatum is petroleum jelly. ""Vaseline"" is petroleum jelly (100%). Aquaphor lists other ingredients as ""Inactive Ingredients.""If I could, I would give this products NO stars."
1,Burned,Burned my already tender skin until I had to remove the product. Not easy task!!! I want a refund! If applied to lips it would be even worse.
3,Probably works fine but...,"Got this (as recommended by the artist) for tattoo aftercare. Was cheap and arrived promptly. Probably works great, but won't be using it any more - stuff stinks to high heaven. Not exactly subtle, plus one afternoon of breathing this in has left me nauseated."
2,"Great item, wrong description","Baby aquaphor is great although it didnt do much for my baby's ecezema, it left him with some bumps on his face. I do not have anything against the product, but I would just like to state that this ad is wrong. The description says 14 oz, it is really only 3 oz. I purchased this item thinking it was a great price but I could have gotten the 3 oz cheaper in the store! I just wanted to warn everyone before you purchase this and have to go through all the trouble of returning it like I do!"
3,Greasy.. works fine.. too pricy,This product is very greasy. It is highly priced here. We got one from the supermarket for lesser price and no shipping charges
2,Worked at First....,"My lips have become extremely chapped this past winter so I bought this product after talking with a friend. At first it was great, my lips finally seemed to be healing. However, after about three weeks, I started to develop an allergy to the ingredients. Exactly which one? No idea. But I definitely can't use this product anymore."
4,Great skin protection,"I use this on my kids and baby when they have cracks in their skin, it clears it up the next day! It is much better than Vaseline and is worth the cost because it lasts a long time. You can even use it on cracked hands"
3,pretty but no sound of running water,This fountain is pretty but might as well be a bird bath because you cannot hear the water running when it is turned on.
3,looks great,"Fountain looks great, had it for years now. Only wish the water coming out was at a higher velocity, it just trickles down."
3,Not what i expected!,My daughter loves this game and put it on her Christmas list. The stones were colored - just primary colors. But I was disappointed because the board is plastic. The clips that snap it closed seem weak and I am not expecting them to last. Looks and feels cheap. You get what you pay for with this set.
3,Great game... stones too big.,"The board is nicely finished and, unlike other reviewers, we did get multicolored stones. However, they are far too big for the size of the holes on the board, so they start spilling out mid-game. We've had to pick them up from the floor every single time we play!"
3,Good but not what described.,Well I got the game I wanted and it was in the original box and instructions. However when it said light wear from use I did not expect the the pieces that let the board fold up and hold the two pieces together to just fall off and never stay on. So for a game that should be one board when unfolded end up becoming a bother with the broken pieces.All in all it is all workable and has all the needed pieces.
3,Comes with mic clip,"When I bought this, its unclear if it comes with a mic clip. So I ended up buying a ""heavy duty"" clip that wasn't that great.It doesn't show it in the photo, but it does indeed come with a clip.Also, the cable is XLR, so if you want to plug it into a guitar amp, you'll either need an XLR to 1/4"" adapter or buy another cable."
1,Not so good!,"Used the transcriber for 2 months and it started to erase the tapes before they were transcribed.,Had to send it back and got a refurbished unit. Not so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Sony Microcasstte Recorder Model M2000A,The unit works well with respect to allowing the user to transcribe verbal information from Cassette tape. The weak link seems to be the foot pedal which can get sticky and unresponsive with heavy use. We had to replace one and ended up buying a whole new unit due to the difficulty of finding just the foot pedal part for replacement.
3,Not bad,"I used an older Sony machine prior to purchasing this one. While it's nice that it's smaller, it only gives you 3 options for reverse time (and none are right for what I'm used to) and it doesn't have the ability to erase a tape when you're done. It also does not have an on/off switch. It goes on when you hit the foot pedal."
5,Sony Transcriber,I like this transcriber because it does not have an erase button so no accidentially erasing the boss's dictation!!! :)
4,Transcribing made easy.,"As the Purchasing Agent for a Government entity in South Florida, I find often the products I purchase from Amazon are some of the best on the market at a competitive price.The Transcribing machine worked great and my end users requested this model by name."
1,Weak.,"Very pretty, however, after barely a month of use, the 'polyresin' marble look bowl (which is obviously a polyresin coating) is beginning to blister and peel away from the inner bowl."
5,Fantastic & Lovely Dove & Rose Birdbath.,"This birdbath is so unique. I purchased it for my husband's birthday, but I'm enjoying it as much or even more than he is. The bowl is just the right size for the smaller birds as well as the larger birds we have coming to our feeders. It's very easy to keep clean and full. I would certainly reccomend this to any bird watcher."
2,Extremely basic information,"I checked this book out of the library and that was a relief, because I did not waste $12.95. I found nothing new or special in this book. There are plenty of other Barbie books out there that may be a bit more expensive but you will get your money's worth if you spend an extra $10-15 on one of them.There is no price guide, no list of the vintage outfits available, and only 16 pages of color photos. (16 pages isn't very impressive when you've seen Barbie books that contain hundreds and hundreds of color photos.)I gave this book 2 stars because it's fairly inexpensive and it could be helpful to a complete novice who has never read _anything_ about Barbie collecting. There are still better, more informative options for absolute beginners. A lot of the advice in here is generic common sense and BASIC information that could apply to any collectible hobby."
3,"Text in Malayalam, not Hindi","I have given a rating of 3 stars because Amazon will not let me give no rating, which is what I would prefer to give.One of my university's libraries has a copy of this book, which I have examined. The text is in Malayalam, rather than Hindi as Amazon indicates. However, it does have the peculiarity that section titles are in English."
4,Capone and the history of Chicago,"I liked the book, referring to the hard cover, it takes a good author to keep up your interest for 619 pgs. It kept you thinking and did not become bogged down as many bios. do. The author gives an insiders view of a gangsters life, and the lives he took. It was also a good study on Chicago in the 20s and 30s."
3,To Mattix on his review of this book,"Hey Mattix, even if Al Capone's lawman brother wasn't a war hero like he claimed and even if a couple of indians were tougher than he was ---so what? Hart was a better, more decent man than his gangster brother Al. And Hart was incredible too as he was a bodyguard to US President Calvin Coolidge (and that's no fish story)."
4,the real Capone,"This is a great book. It shows us that Capone was not only a villain, but also a man who was loved by the common people. Bergreens book is hard to put down, because of his fluid writing style. Everybody knows the story of the St Valentine's Day massacre, and that time when he beat a man to death with a baseball bat. New to me however was how he spent his days in jail and what he did after he got out of it. After his time in Alcatraz he was just a lonely man who didn't know know what he was doing because of his neurosyphilis. You kinda feel sorry for him. A great biography of the most famous man in the history of crime."
1,Nothing new,"I just had to say to anyone reading this book, don't be too impressed over the story of Capone's lawman brother ""Two-Gun"" Hart. After all, there is a movie from years ago about the relationship between the two brothers. It stars Eric Roberts as Al Capone. Check it out sometime, it's rather good. Therefore I'm not too impressed over the author's ""discovery""."
2,best priced fountain,"rhis is an incredible fountain and the price is so low, thanks to amazon, Its very well made to last years, attarcts birds in the yard by the Dozens!!100 percent satisfied"
1,Are YOU kidding?,"I cannot believe it! Almost $40 for a cd? I'm headed to mp3'trons for this one. Fred, you created a fan base and now ,,, why are you trying to ,,, ""slash"" us?Disappointed Jorio fan !"
2,Two Stars,I have owned three Lanier Microcassette Recorders over the past thirty years. It was everything they advertised it to be. When I went to buy one this time they were no longer being made. They were replaced by this Sony BM-575. It isn't half the recorder that the Lanier was. You can't record in noisy areas without picking up all the background noises. The plaback is nowhere as clear as the Lanier. If I could find a Lanier right now I would buy one and throw this Sony away.
4,Philip Johnson : Life and Work - a good bio about a genius,"A great book about my favorite architect. Johnson's buildings are truly an example of his passion and distinct style. Franz Schulze went to great lengths to describe his career from working w/ Mies ,his partnership w/ John Burgee to practicing alone at 90+ years old. The book discusses his up & down life that impacted his work."
1,Fine Book; Lame Architect,"Franz Schultz's book is actually the most honest overview of Johnson and his work to date.I felt compelled to provide a ""one-star"" rating largely to counteract the previous reviews that suggest that Johnson is somehow worthy of admiration with regard to both his character and his work.Like Heidegger, Johnson was a fervent admirer and active supporter of Nazism. Unlike Heidegger, he wasn't particularly talented in his field -- that is if you consider his field to have been architecture. His buildings are largely uninspired, if not downright awful.I would harbor serious doubts about the judgement of anyone who would consider him their ""favorite architect"".""Passionate"" perhaps in his true calling as a cynical powerbroker and publicity hound. Well-educated, wealthy, and witty, but hardly ""enlightened"" and definitely not an architectural ""genius""."
2,great while it lasted--update--4 stars,"I received this espresso machine as a gift in June of 2004. It worked great till this month, when all of a sudden large amounts of steam started coming out when we tried to make a cup of espresso. I don't think the milk frother ever really worked properly, either. Today I went to de-scale it, and found that the heating element has broken. DeLonghi says I have to send it to a service center and they won't cover any costs because I'm out of warranty. But for a $300 machine, I expected a lot better quality. Not worth it if I have to replace it every 18 months.Update--my husband took the machine apart and found a fuse that had blown. He replaced it and it's working for now, but we're getting a spare thermostat and fuse to keep on hand. Also, you need a special kind of tool to unscrew the body, found in auto supply stores mostly.Update: It's now April 2007 and the machine is still working great, no more repairs needed."
1,Worked great... for about 2 months,"I received this machine as a Christmas gift. It worked great for about two months. Then, without warning, it freaked out. First, after frothing milk the pump would not shut off and it unloaded an entire reservoir of water all over my kitchen counter. I unplugged the unit, and plugged back in, hoping this would reset it. Instead, it will no longer shut off at all.This, in my opinion, is a dangerous machine. It has a ""soft"" power switch that's dependent on a microprocessor. If the microprocessor fails, you lose the ability to shut off the machine.One thing I will say is that De'Longhi customer service was top notch. They were very helpful, even stating they would be happy to pay for any damage to my countertop (fortunately, there wasn't any). They also got a replacement machine to me within a week. It was the EC-701 model, which seems to be a better design all the way around."
2,What a pain!,"I have had many problems with this machine. It is VERY temperamental: turns on but never heats up, heats up but doesn't produce steam, sometimes it doesn't even turn on at all!!! This morning, because of yet another problem with this machine, I had to dust off my espresso maker that I have had since COLLEGE and that little, inexpensive machine STILL works better than my bells-and-whistles delonghi. I would NEVER recommend this headache to anyone."
4,NHL ....before the shine,"Im not into hockey as my father used to be..he used to listen to theMontreal Canadian all the times, and lucky guy probably saw all the greatplayers play...Maurice Richard, Jean Beliveau and so much more. Playingfor peanuts in the old days the players had more characters than most oftodays millionaire players. The only thing i remember from Maurice Richard isthat white hair guy getting standing ovations most of the time he went tosee a game at the Montreal Forum.Now after seeing this movie and learning more about his life, im amazed whatthis guy did and played and what he did for the world of hockey.Enjoy.."
1,Stay away!!,"Don't make the mistake of buying this product. Learn from my mistake, I lost my hard earned $90 on this useless buggy piece of software.I am still no able to digest the idea that you have to keep all your banking information on their servers to be able to receive bank transactions automatically. If you are concerned about security and automatic transaction updates are important to you, do not buy this product.Other problems:- Does not updates bank transactions consistently- Clicking on update creates accounts one more time instead of just downloading the transactions- Custom invoice template is a big mess. You can create custom templates and save them. But, you cannot edit them or use them to print invoices.I wonder what kind of dimwit product manager has managed and released this product.I wish there was some kind of consumer protection law that would let me return this product and get my money back."
2,Used MS Money program,Couldn't use it : unsuitability with my computer leading to irreparable (at reasonable cost with no guarantee of result) password problem.
5,Works for me,"I have been using this product for over a year and it has been working well. I have no yellow spots in the yard and I have 2 dogs, one male, one female. Make sure you follow the instructions on the bottle. This needs to build up in their system prior to going to the ""maintenance"" amount."
2,So so,"This was my first time using any of this style of NO GRASS Burns so I dont have anything to base off of. BUT, I think the pills work OK. I have about 10 or so grass burns in my freshly laid Down sod. 10 in about 3 month. I'm not satisfied with that tho, I want much less. I have 3 dogs, 2 cavaliers and 1 border collie so if you look at it from a positive view...3 dogs 3 months=10 burns, not bad. I am now trying another brand a long with spraying down whenever I see them pee with water. Fingers crossed this works."
1,grass saver pills,These were a waste of money. They dogs hated the taste and refused to take them. Would not recommend this product
1,Get Your Money Back,I do not recommend this product to anyone. My grass is still turning yellow after two months of use and it's a struggle every day to get my dog to eat the pills. There has got to be a better product out there!
1,Not Effective,"I've been using this product for some time now and it has not really helped. I also became a little more educated about the yellowing problem and found out that adjusting the pH level in a dog's urine will not correct yellowing. The problem is a high level of nitrogen. A new product out of Australia called ""Dog Rocks"" has gotten some good press and may help."
4,Works for my dog,We have been using these for quite awhile now. They don't completely stop the yellowing and dead grass but they do help alot. I have an 80lb lab and as long as I am consistent in giving them to her they work well. And she loves them!
2,"Works, but as others say has side effects","The good news is I don't have yellow spots in my backyard. After a few weeks of using the pills they work as advertisedThe bad news is our dog also got hives. We've been trying to figure out why our 50 lb white boxer was getting rashes. We eliminated going to certain grass areas where we thought they may have been treating/fertilizing, but she was still getting the hives. My wife brought up the thought of these pills, but I had discounted them as the cause because she didn't get hives for the first couple weeks taking them. Then I realized it takes a few weeks for them to start effectively diluting the dog's urine. I've reduced her intake to 1 pill per day and the hives have reduced, but have not gone away. We're just going to have to quit using the pills and try a different approach.I'd recommend trying them, but check your dog regularly for any adverse reactions and stop the pills immediately if you notice anything."
5,A++ product... does what it says it does.... saves grass from urine burn,Can't say enough about how great this product works. I've been using it for years with no side effects to my dog.
4,"Good Item, but you have to be consistent","This is my second year of using the NaturVet Grass Saver tablet in hopes to offset my dog's damage to our lawn.The product works but you have to be consistent with making sure the dog gets the product on a daily basis. If not, the product doesn't work correctly.Very good product and i will continue to use the product to offset the damage my dog does to the lawn."
2,not my dog's first choice,"I've used several varieties of these kind of products the last two or three years and have had success. This is the first time I've purchased this particular brand. While my dog has been happy to ""eat"" the others she turns her nose up at these. I may have initially saved a few dollars with this brand but it is a total waste if she won't even eat them. I can't say how effective they are but will say that the other brands I've purchased have helped to eliminate new yellow spots in our lawn. I'll go back to my other brand next time."
2,Not for my mutts,I have 2 Labs and after 3 monhts of using the product has done nothing for my yard... back to google to search for something that actually works
1,a worthless product,"I had been using Petco's Grass be Green for a couple of years for my male shih tzu. It worked beautifully---no more brown spots at all, with no side effects for him. When I ran out, about a month ago, I decided to try GrassSaver because I could get it online more quickly than I could get to the store. Suddenly realized my lawn has numerous brown spots once again. I am headed to Petco today!"
1,Not Good!,"Does not work effectively. I have a 1yr old female German Shepherd who was ruining our brand new sod. I bought the GrassSaver Biscuits and they worked perfectly, almost immediately. I noticed the yellow spots stopped after 3 days and it was like giving her 3 treats a day! Then I went back to the store for more and they were sold out so I figured the tablets would work just as well considering they were more expensive. Not only did the yellow spots start happening again but she started SHEDDING EXCESSIVELY! We thought she was losing her coat late in the season but we did some research and realized it was a side effect from the tablets (which she did not have with the biscuits). I recommend the biscuits, we are going back to them.NaturVet GrassSaver Chewable Wafers For Dogs 300-count"
2,Doesn't work...,The product didn't work for my dog. Both vet and landscaper says they have never seen these pills work... Not worth the process/hassle to send the claim in for the $20 refund)
4,Works For Me,"I've ben using this product for years, but if I miss a day or two then I get spots. Its important to use it even when the snow is just melting off your lawn, and late into the fall when you think the lawn is dormant. I crush the pills up with a pestle and mix it with their food otherwise they wouldn't eat it."
2,Broke my dog out in Hives,"My dog is 120 lb Presa Canario (Bull Mastiff type) and this product broke him out in 1-2 cm itchy, red hives all over his stomach. So yes, there are adverse effects associated with this product. It did, however, keep him from turning my grass into a pile of yellow burn spots but this side effect makes it unusable."
4,Save your grass,"I THINK it is working, but we got to fall too soon before I have a good sense. The lawn seemed to be doing better."
1,Naturvet GrassSaver,"Doesn't work, period. According to the product, you can contact the manufacturer for questions or if it isn't working as described. Utilized this product on both of our dogs, one medium one small. Worked for neither, even after following the directions to the T. Beware, the manufacturer will not respond to emails or letters concerning the effectiveness of this product. Was hoping for another bottle so I could give it another chance but now I just want my money back. Don't get your hopes up or wate your hard-earned money on this product!!! Buyer beware, you've been warned."
5,Essential CD for easy listening fans,"As a best of collection, I rate this CD as an equal to Sinatra, Tom Jones and any other male easy listening singers of the 70s. Tony Christie had hit records from 1970-76 and continues to record into this decade, even scoring a UK and European top ten hit in 1999 with Walk Like A Panther. This CD covers his 70s peak: his soaring vocals, not unlike Tom Jones, stamped his authority over Is This The Way To Amarillo, I Did What I Did For Maria, Don't Go Down To Reno and over a dozen others. My personal favourite is Avenues And Alleyways, a gloriously over-the-top epic. What makes Christie more listenable than most other Vegas-style big-voiced balladeers is the soulfulness of his vocals. He really commits himself to each song."
4,Sushi cook book,"very nice and received in a timely fashion, ordered sushi mats at the same time and these took two weeks extra from arrival of book, I was lucky it was not the same vendor as the book."
1,ServeSafe answer sheet,"Dear Amazon.com,I have repeatedly asked metropole_press to send me the answer sheet which I ordered and paid for and she responded by saying, ""We did not lie to you; we ran out of copies of the answer sheet as your order was processed alongside others. You are asking us for a special order from an outside company, which is something we do not do."" However, metropole_press told the bank that she offered to send me the answer sheet! This is not true! I have requested that she send it and she told me that she would not.I purchased an answer sheet from this supplier. She refuses to send it saying, ""We ran out of copies of the answer sheet as your order was processed alongside others.""Please do not waste your time and money with this person!"
2,There are much better Graph Theory Books,"The errors in this text are unfortunate, and the presentation is not engaging. I did find that ""A First look at Graph Theory"" by Clark and Holton was useful and ""Introduction to Graph Theory"" by Chartrand and Zhang, was very readable."
3,African Male Nude in Art & Photography a little over the top,"While the book has very beautiful photo quality of black men, at the same time I feel there are some photos that are rather questionable or should not have been included in this book..two men kissing was somewhat of a turn-off that took away from the beauty of it. What was the photographer saying, embrace is one thing mouth2mouth kiss another...Overall it was beautiful"
1,Size 4X????,Purchased these for my 2x frame.....wanted really big and comfy....fit more like XL...useless to me.
3,Not made well...,"This teakettle looks like a second. The red glaze was missing in an area on the spout and on the body of the pot. It is black where it isn't red... The handle has a rough spot on the edge. Amazon offered to refund my money if I returned it - at their expense. They would have given me an exchange, but there was not a red one available. I decided to keep it. It heats quickly and pours easily. The kettle is still very attractive. Every time someone comes into my kitchen they comment on it. Alas, it will rust if I leave water in it... So I need to be mindful of that."
4,Running Solid,"The setup took some effort, but my previous routers were consumer plug-and-play models. I setup web and email servers on my LAN and exposed them to the internet using the router and dedicated IPs. This router has been a solid workhorse. Barring power interruptions, it's been up since the Fall of 2008."
5,Top Quality & Performance,We give one to these to each of our customers and they perform perfectly. They make store bought ones line Netgear and Linksys look like toys. These will handle VoIP and other high packet rate items perfectly.
3,Problems with Vista and 2008...,The support for this router is terrible... The latest firmware is buggy and it does not work correctly with Vista or Windows 2008 server. I see a net split issue where I could go to [...] and ping it and I could not go to [...] or ping it. This issue does not occur with XP or Windows Server 2003. This router is stable however runs like a champ.
2,No shut off.,I expected these to have the shut off feature when you removed the male portion. They did not.I wanted to replace mine because the shut off was broken. I basically replaced them for nothingNot what I expected.
4,Very nice recording,"This album has amazing sound quality and the recording is stunning. All the CD's from the same label seem to have excellent quality. For lovers of the mallet and percussion instruments, this CD is a must! The track ""Jazz Variants"" is quite possibly one of the best demo cuts for high-end audiophile systems that I have ever heard! Most of the music is just so-so, but a couple of the tracks are quite good. This is a ""must-have"" for audiophiles looking for amazing well-recorded music to challenge their systems with."
4,Childhood Friends Drift Apart in High School,"I read this book only because the author is getting so much mileage out of her other Young Adult novel, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. This earlier novel is a great addition to the angst filled genre of teen novels about trying to fit in. So many of the situations described match what my own 13-year-old daughter is going through. The only complaint I had is that the girl's friend goes from being a geek to a popular girl seemingly overnight and easily earns a slot on the cheerleading squad without even taking a dance lesson. I don't think someone can enter a different clique that quickly and effortlessly. I do believe that longterm friends can suddenly drift apart, and the hurt caused from that situation is captured brilliantly in this book."
2,"Great for straight cuts, anything else...","I purchased this as a hopefully cheap solution to cutting the outline of a couple rifles for a pelican case. The shape of the cutter is not conducive at all to cutting anything besides a straight exterior line. Trying to cut an interior edge, or a curved line was nearly impossible. After fiddling around with it and reversing the metal pieces in order to open up the wire as much as possible, I had a small amount of success. Overall, it was more of a pain and less effective in cutting the foam then hoped. It did a very crude job. The wire refused to stay taught, when attempting to keep it tight it would break, and the fact that you had to continuously hold the trigger wasn't annoying.If you are using this for any sort of serious project, your best bet is to make your own cutter, or use something else."
4,Seems to work,"Got this to cut the foam in my Pelican case so my AR would have that ""custom fit"" look. Worked much better than I expected it to, cause for the low price compared to a lot of the other foam cutters, I wasn't expecting much. Pleased to say I was surprised. After a few practice cuts to get the hang of it, it seems to work reasonably well, extremely well if you factor in the cost advantage.Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend looking for something to cut their gun case foam with."
3,"It's cheap, and it works. And it should cost half its price.",It didn't work when I first received it. So I took it apart. Very cheaply made and very simple. The problem was some bad switch contact points. The switch is really shoddy. Put it back together and it works great now and does what it was advertised to do. But it could have been made with about $10 worth of parts from radio shack and home depot. You might even have all the parts except for maybe the wire. But buying it saved me some time and experimentation.
2,Underpowered,"I bought this cutter to cut upholstery foam. There are a couple of major problems. There is no simple way to tighten the cutting wire so it tends to sag in the middle. Second, it does not get hot enough to slice through the material and has to be dragged through it instead. In addition its dimensions make it useful only for small pieces. I ended up using a hack-saw blade for most of the the work on a large 4 inch thick sheet."
2,Hard to Use,"I was disappointed in this. I needed a foam cutter for a group project, and it didn't really work. It was pretty cheaply made, so when I screwed the prongs in, the two pieces of the handle would move apart and the circuit would break. It became an infuriating game of trying to get the prongs tight enough to stay in but loose enough to keep the circuit together. Nobody else in my group was able to make it work. The wire also broke easily, and I wasn't willing to pay for more of it when the foam cutter was already so shoddy. It seemed easier to cut our insulation foam with a knife and then sand it down (even if it did take longer and didn't look as good as simple cuts through several pieces of foam all at the same time)."
2,Light duty cutting only,"Dense foam cuts VERY slowly. Light foam like expanded polystyrene (beadboard) cut like butter, tho. I tried cutting a foam wine bottle cork and it took forever (almost)."
3,Great now I can make terrain but...,"So I've got big plans for this terrain piece I'm making. So I order one of these because a knife just isn't gonna do the job. There are only two items that are linked to this unit the ""hot wire cutter"" and ""replacement wires"". Replacement wire kind of implies that it is replacing a wire that came with the unit when the unit does not. That kind of pissed me off like not getting batteries(made by different manufacturer) with your remote control car makes sense but not getting a wire with your hot wire cutter is just dumb."
2,not worth it,for the price you would think it would last longer. it works fine until the wire breaks. buy somethinf different.
1,I did not work,This is the first time I have returned an item at Amazon. They make it a painless as possible. But it still took some time. When I went back to review my order I was shocked at how must I paid for this. It really is not a very high quality product. In my opinion it is about 40% over priced for the quality. You will buy one becuase there is not much ells out there. When you get it just look at it and think. $40.00 plus shipping. You have Been Warned!
1,DOA - Don't waste your money,"DOA - Cheap junk, isn't worth 10 bucks much less $30. Don't waste your time.DOA - Cheap junk, isn't worth 10 bucks much less $30. Don't waste your time.DOA - Cheap junk, isn't worth 10 bucks much less $30. Don't waste your time."
2,Matthew you could have done your research even under marilyn monroe biographies,why do you and others continue to perpetuate the movie magazine stories and call them non fiction even da vinci code is fictionplease guys do your research and find the marilyn monroe foundation and her daughter nancy miracle who wrote a great play which tells the heretofore untold real story ofthe person behind the image it's about time not the same old story not again please it's 2006
5,Finally Justice!,"thank you thank you thank youI can't stress that enough. I have believed and it's so obvious that the Mob and Kennedy's were behind this the whole time. Anyone can do there own research and declare the same truth but, most decided it's preposterous to think some one like the ""Kennedy's"" could conjure such a horrible thing. WAKE up people and give me a break. Do your history research of Joseph Kennedy and the government alone. There's crap they get away with constantly don't be naive. There's has been so many facts about this I can't believe it took this long for the justice of Marilyn Monroe. I am a huge fan and now she CAN rest in peace.ashley mosely(...)"
5,Classy knick-knack,"This is a nice statue. It is not, I believe, a copy of any specific classical work; I believe rather it was inspired by William-Adolphe Bouguereau's 1879 painting ""The Birth of Venus."" The piece is chalk-white. I wish it had come in a more antique finish, but it looks like the photo, so no complaints here. Inside the shipping box, the piece itself came in a very attractive gift box, so that's a plus, if you are considering a gift: no wrapping necessary."
5,Nice padding...,This is a replacement for ortho gel that I had purchased for other purposes that didn't work out but now I use it as a knee pad for my yoga classes. I made a washable and removable cover for it since it is not washable! My first one lasted for a couple of years before I noted some compression. Not the typical use of this product but sure works.
3,Wrong Edition,"This is a republication, without the author's knowledge, of the 1984 Command and General Staff College textbook. Because that work is in the public domain, I am unable to control publication. However, readers interested in this topic would be better served by reading the revised and extended (through the year 2000) version, published by University Press of Kansas as Combined Arms Warfare in the Twentieth Century."
3,"Works great, durability is questionable","How long can you expect a travel mug to last? My husband and I have used our two mugs every week day for the past 14 months. The mugs are hand washed every day. The first mug had its plastic liner separate from the steel outer layer within 6 months; the second mug just had this same separation yesterday. The reason this happens is because the lid seals extremely well to the plastic liner. When the lid is removed to wash the inside of the mug, a lot of pressure is exerted to separate the two pieces. The mug itself does a very good job of keeping the coffee warm for several hours and, if knocked over, it doesn't let a lot of coffee out. So if you feel that 6 months -- 14 months of nearly every day use is the life expectancy of a travel mug, this is the mug for you."
3,Good Product ? / Good Value ?,"There is some question about the durability of this cup as noted elsewhere more specifically with the rubberized grip which loosens over time and tends to move around.This cup is compatible with the Cuisinart Two To Go coffeemaker, a fine product whose name is most descriptive of its function. The Two To Go coffeemaker which is generally available for around $20 includes two of these cups which makes the price of the singular cup offered here seem over priced."
2,Mine fell apart too - real quick,"I had this mug in rotation with two others from different makers. It may have went through the dish washer (top shelf) three times in about a month and a half. The rubber bottom fell off. The inner cup seperated from the outer liner. I've tried to hot glue it back together with no luck. Definetly not worth the money. Incidently, the two other cups - one was a promotion item from a trade show, the other was a gift from Starbucks that came with a gift card. I've used the two other mugs, dishwasher and all and they have held up. Incidently. I bought the mug along with a Cuisinart Grind and Brew. now that is a great product!"
2,Battery Description not so.,"The received battery and the text description do not match.The text description tells of a 1000mAh battery, made in Japan.The battery received is a 730mAh battery made in China.The above image and the actual battery differ as well. Not a big deal, but defiantly not like a brick-and-mortar store where you can see/touch what you are getting at the time of purchase. You'll see an image, and read a description, but not get the exact item."
3,Review of Forced Hot Air Furnaces,"The book is published in 1999. There is agood discussion on older technologies like standing pilot, intermittent pilot, HSIetc. There is very lirrle information on ""Direct Spark Ignition System"" which was available in late seventies. I was disappointed in the book because it had very little discussion on DSI systems. I have a house built in 1979. I was hoping to find this type of information from a book written in 1999. It had very little information on control modules, ignitor flame sensors, ignition retries, lockout etc which is vital in trpuble shooting DSI type of hot air furnaces.I am still looking for a good book on this subject !"
1,"Forced Hot Air Furnaces, Roger Vizi","Very disappointed. Very little information on later model heaters.In the good old days, with ineffecient heaters and standing pilots, heaters tended to be trouble free. In 40 years I never had a heater problem until I started living with draft inducers and control modules. Now I continually have problems with these new heaters in the houses I own and those problem are related to draft inducer motors, sensors, hot surface igniter, electrical igniters, and solid state control boards. Hello!! This book contains essentially no information on most of these items and their application to gas fired forced air furnaces.I have to wonder why anyone would write a book in 1999 and leave out the subject matter pertaining to the areas that cause the modern heaters to fail.Sincerely,vern"
3,the book left out an important chapter,"I bought this book so that I, as a homeowner, would be able to do some preliminary troubleshooting of the furnace and optimization of the heating system before calling the experts. I liked the introductions to the different types of heating systems, but was really, really disappointed that there was no discussion of how to balance the flow of heat throughout your home using the registers and dampers in the ductwork. There is a sentence in the 2nd or 3rd chapter stating that ""a later chapter"" will focus on this, but that later chapter is non-existent."
5,A homeowner wanted to know,"I am a homeowner and I wanted to know how my furnace worked, so I pick up a copy of this book. I was amazed at how simple it was to understand.I don't want to repair my own furnace, but I want to understand how it works so when I do have to call a repairman out, I know what they are talking about.This is a wonderful book for any homeowner,and I have told all of my friends to get a copy so they can understand how thier system works. I will also say I am not considering purchasing a heat pump after reading this book because I now understand how they work."
4,Force Hot Air Furnaces Troubleshooting and Repair,This book allows a person with minimal experience or knowledge understand the fundamentals of furnaces and provides detailed instructions on repair.There are many pictures. It covers many kinds of forced air furnaces. The language is easy to understand. There are details.I read it in a few hours.
3,outdated,"This is a rather okay introduction to forced air systems, but quite out of date with what I have now in my home."
5,I fix everything in my house,"Great book! Good information on forced hot air furnaces. Helped me determine how to change fan , but along the way i also discovered the furnace has other problems and probably not worth fixing."
3,Forced Hot Air Furnaces : Troubleshooting and Repair,"This book is ok. Not much else available on the subject, this is the best one I could find."
1,A is to B as 1 is to ........,"If you know the answer to that question, then you are already more competent than this book. Don't waste your time with this little girl's book."
4,sugested,this book is a must for the hvac professional. plain easy to understand ways of diagnostic. as a hvac profesional i highly recommend this book
3,Furnace book.........,"Its like going to the store when you are hungry, you should never buy an item when you are despirete. The book is ok covers most situations but you know how luck runs, doesnt tell how to set pressures. Ok for the novice with no serious complications."
1,Poor Design,"This is really great idea, but the problem is that it comes apart real easy. Not funny getting all wet. Threw it away after trying everything to keep it from happening."
1,Leaks everywhere.,"Bought 2 of these so I could easily add hose to reach my apple orchard. Each one leaked between the quick connection. It was quite a good leak to. Shame, they looked very well made."
2,"Not consistent, works sometimes, others it spews water all over",This seems to work on the front side of my house but when I tried to do the same thing on the back it just spews water everywhere out of the part where the male connects to the female connector. I've swapped parts and hoses to no avail. These are going to be returned.
3,Disappointed in sound,"Keep in mind that I am an audiophile when reading this review. After collecting all of the Dead DVD's this one is the most disappointing in terms of audio quality - in fact it SOUNDS like a stadium show from the upper deck. The instruments are flat and the sound seperation is shallow at best. In comparison to the Alpine Valley DVD - if you are a first time buyer for Dead shows in this format - you will much better off with the Alpine show. I found Jerry to be feeling the heat of this PA show - hot and muggy on that day, and a little sluggish at times. Don't get me wrong - after seeing many shows myself and reviewing the three available releases, this is great to see the trend of getting into the vault for the video feeds... and of course any time I can get to spend time reliving my youth - well - that's just great. I just wish the sound had been remastered because it's flat flat flat."
3,Hoping for more!,"The preformance is excellent but will be most appreciated by true Deadheads as the majority of songs may be less familliar to casual fans. The band is tight and in good form. The picture quality on the DVD is simpley spectacular. There are, however, several problems with this recording. As mentioned by other reviewers the ""special effects"" in the second set are extremely annoying and amatuerish creating a terrible distraction from the reason we're watching - the bands preformance. While the sound track is generally crisp and clear, as one would expect from a DVD, it oftens seems disconected from the picture. The vocals are always spot-on and Jerry's guitar work is well captured but often you'll see activity by other members of the band, especially the drum set(s), that do not seem to be included in the sound track. Despite these critisisms, fans of the Grateful Dead will enjoy this 3 1/2 hour DVD!"
2,Not very good,"I was at this Dead show on a miserably hot and humid evening in the summer of 1990. Perhaps the record heat affected the Dead's performance. It was the most lackluster Dead concert I ever attended (out of six). This video was made from the feed to the screen above the stage and the sound board mix. Thus, the boring special effects and the flat sound quality on this release. Get the Grateful Dead Movie (see my review on it) instead of this, and let's hope for some better quality releases of some of the Dead's prime shows from the late '80s to '95. There were some great ones."
4,about that animation,"i dont have this view from the vault but I have the fourth one and if its like that one which I'm presuming it is, the footage is the footage that was played on projector screens at the show explaining that animation, no one has any control over whether or not its on the dvd because its part of the original footage...thought I'd let people know that, read the dvd inlet."
5,Take a step back in time!,"Watching this DVD was a little like a time warp for me. Excellent footage, a fine set list, and seeing Brent again all combined for a great experience. I really wished i'd had the souped-up speakers on my computer for this one. ""tom thumb"" is wonderful, but be careful, ""knockin on heaven's door"" will bring a tear to your eye. ""Greatest story"" and ""jack-a-roe"" are hoppin; happy feet, watch out! You get the ""whole show"" experience here; plus a lot more footage than the vhs version. visually well done. I sure hope they can come up with some earlier shows on video, like pre-'87 - and some west coast shows would be great too. But for anyone who misses the musical camaraderie on stage from the Dead, this is one to get. Glad I did."
2,The Vault Must Be Empty,"Yes, the sound is mix is OK and the video is clear but the special effects absolutely kill this DVD. The performance is just OK.Where are all the other classics that have been preserved, even if they are in black and white? What about those house feeds at the Capitol Theater in Passaic NJ? The New Years Eve Shows? Live feeds for special events or TV?There must be better out there or the GD really screwed up in not documenting themselves on film or video. I guess we will have to wait and see."
2,Repetitive,"While the action scenes are fairly well written the plot leaves something to be desired. This romp though the Mournlands seems to be stuck in a loop as Kandler and his shifter sidekick repeatedly track his adopted daughter and rescue her, only to have her kidnapped again.While it might be useful as introduction to some of the elements of the Eberron world, the characters and plot are not developed enough to make a great novel."
4,Books of Death,"I just finished the trilogy, so I am gonna review the books as a whole for this.The series is good. The first book has a pace and characters that you could grow to love and hate. It is a little angering because the whole time its a game of catch-up. That comes to an end in book 2 (thankfully). The 3rd book is also worth reading and only gets better. It worked like good fiction ought to.I would have to rate this series as a 4 star. The characters are decent and the plot, although cliche' is still intriguing to read. You will find that it has some cinematic qualities to it which makes a great read to get lost in."
3,Another Decent Effort for Eberron,"Since I wasn't reading much fantasy when TSR first started with their books, I can't tell if a new world needed a few books before it hit its stride. If so, then it seems Eberron will fit in nicely with Forgotten Realms. The book has its ""ridiculous"" parts (how many times can a girl be lost?), and I quote ridiculous since we are talking about the fantasy genre. The characters were rather likable, and the author's refusal to keep all the main characters alive was refreshing. Much like the first Eberron book, I think this trilogy will get better as it goes along, so I'm looking forward to the next offering."
3,Nothing new here...,"I am really trying to give the world of Ebberon a fair try. This is the second novel ever released for the world, so it comes with some unusually high expectations.So far, I have found nothing really to grab my attention in the Ebberon world. This novel is rather bland. Yes there is a plot here, but it seems so forced and contrived that it doesn't seem like a story.When I read a fantasy novel, I don't like to have things handed to me. I don't like a book that's rushed - and to a point that's what this book turns out to be is a very rushed novel at times. The entire concept of the girl getting kiddnapped was a great start, but the more times the main character 'loses' her the more it feels like the author couldn't think of anything new to add to the story.While this wasn't the worst book I have ever read - it wasn't the best either. I would like to recommend this for a brief time waster, but I'm not sure I could even recommend this book for that..."
4,Good introduction to the Eberron world.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book (and the entire trilogy!). It's the first novel I read from the Eberron world and it made me interested in learning more about it and reading more novels set therein.The storyline is very action-packed and the short chapters often end in cliff-hanger type situations that made me reluctant to put the book down. I think the main characters are fleshed out quite well and some of them (particularly Burch) are very entertaining. The number of times a particular character gets kidnapped frustrated me a bit, but overall I really liked this book. Forbeck is a very talented writer.I'd recommend this for fans of Forgotten Realms type fantasy."
1,Marked for Death Review,"This book marks and exemplifies everything about a novel based on an RPG that people loathe and hate.Dumbed down characters, dumbed down plot, dumbed down solutions, ect. to the point it's insulting.I read this and finished only because it's an Eberron Novel and I've wanted to support the new setting.Thank god Wizards has gotten better about screening the quality of authors and stories they accept if they're going to keep players, readers, customers period."
2,A Tough Read,"This was a really tough read for me. The characters are flat, and the story is predictable from beginning to end. I had planned on reading the whole Lost Mark series, but after this book the fate of the Lost Mark will have to remain Lost."
3,Most poorly edited award winner,"This was the worst edited book I've ever read. Oddly, the other Eberron book I read was fairly poorly edited as well. WoTC must have a new editor, who needs to be replaced.The Story was trite, the dialoge weak, and very predictable. I still give the book 3 stars, as even though it had many flaws, it was still reasonably enjoyable, and something other then the seriously over played Forgotten Realms books."
3,"interesting idea, could have been better","I like the general premise, and felt the beginning of the book was pretty strong. But it starts to get pretty repetitive. The same two characters clash over the right thing to do in every situation, and a third takes turns disagreeing with both of them. They keep finding then losing their quarry. The kidnapped girl seems more like a plot device than a character, she gets tossed back and forth between the good guys and the kidnapper so much that it gets silly. Some of the encounters also didn't seem integrated into the main story that well.I really enjoyed the part where they were still in the first town, and the warforged city was a very interesting place. This book was not as good as City of Towers, but much better than The Crimson Talisman, and I'll definitely be checking out the second in the series. Hopefully that one will have a little more variety among the character interactions and the action."
2,I couldn't finish it.,"There are some redeeming parts, the action is fast paced and the descriptions are usually well written, but it's all down hill from there.I made it about 100 pages into this book before putting it down in frustration. The authors tendency to have completely ridiculous and forced dialog drove me batty. I kept thinking ""Now why would they say that? This makes no sense."" For example, in the middle of life or death situation when asked a question a Vampire exclaims ""ah straight to the point, refreshing!"". What? Refreshing?! You wonder if maybe he expected small talk.In another, after a large battle in a village where a group of vampires kidnaps a mans daughter one of the vampires waits around just to tell the heroes not to follow. As if the man isn't going to pursue his daughter? What in the hell? There is no situation I can imagine where this would be a reasonable expectation. I could almost see the villain holding up his pinky Dr. Evil style."

5,Thumbs up for Dale Brown,Was a very well written book on air opperations. More technical than I like but add's to the whole story.
4,Glad it's been released,"If you're a fan of Mos Def, this will definitely be a good pick-up. I've slept on the album for a while and got it about a month ago and it's been steadily rising on my list of favorites. It's definitely better than Mos Def's New Danger album in my opinion.Favorite track: Moon in Cancer"
3,Not her best but still good,"She has a great jazz voice and sings every song with what seems like complete honesty. On straight ahead stuff she is primo. This is a short album, only 9 tracks and expensive as a import is. Five of them rate with her best and the other four are so-so. I'd still buy it because her styling is excellent. With Russell Ferrante of the Yellow Jackets as a side man and arranger the same thread of the other albums carries through. I have a fair collection of Jazz vocalists and comparing what is out there, she deserves to be more popular. I'd buy anything she records sight unseen"
4,Better Than Expected,"Some of Ms. Scott's later offerings do not have as much going for them as this one does. Russell Ferrante (of Ferrante & Teicher & the Yellow Jackets) provides a great piano counterpointe to Marilyn's range. This range has been fully exercised throughout this work. She goes from the mellow to the soaring, especially on the cut ""You're All I Need"". It is exceptional. Ms. Scott should review these efforts before doing another disc. It may help her re-establish a commercial as well as artistic success."
2,Certainly not outstanding!,"There are serious intonation problems, most notably with the thin-sounding soprano sax (he goes sharp a lot). The ensemble synch is fine. The playing, however is pedestrian. The Music Minus One recording of the Goldrush Suite has more verve and humor than here!"
4,Live recording excells,Interesting program of music very well performed. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of the optional improv section in the quartet composed by Phil Woods.
5,Best shampoo for volumizing,This line also protects color treated hair which is an added bonus to a Volumizing shampoo! Great product and pairs wonderfully with the coniditioner.
5,"You hear that ladies ""Just for Men"" keep your stinkin paw's off",This stuff is great on my hair. I call it the super shampoo. My hair hasn't gone gray since two weeks ago. I look younger.
4,Sez Who? Sez Me!,A good historic perspective of Chicago in the 1970'S! So fun and lively that Royko!
3,"Ideal on DX, but corner softness on FX.","Ideal for DX, but not so good on FX.Normally, when you shoot wide angle, you're interested in the whole image sharpness and not only the center. This lens did not quite work out for me on my D700 because of the corner softness. I ended up replacing it with the new Nikon 14-24mm."
2,Too much hype,Well it does not auto focus on Nikon D5000 even though the manual say it does. It is very hard to focus this lens manually. The resulting picture always come out somewhat fuzzy and color is weird. No regular filters would work on it. If you have Nikon D5000 the stock lens work much better then this one. I would not recommend this to a friend.
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this unit and it worked fine the first time. The basket seems to catch and is sometimes hard to open. The second time i used it, I turned it on, the light came on but it never began to brew, the warming plate never got warm. It just died. I was very dis-satisfied with having it work only once. Don't bother."
1,A mess on the counter,"We bought this for our RV and only used it about 30 times with out problems. Then we woke to coffee all over the counter and down on to the floor. I thought perhaps I'd forgotten to close the filter compartment since it was open. So the next morning we set it once again to make our morning brew. My husband was sitting right there and watched it open itself and begin spilling coffee on the counter once again. I checked it and there seems to be no way to securely latch the thing closed. Now, even though we have great success with other delonghi priducts, I will never buy another one and advise you to find a different brand."
4,Pleased,I did a lot of research and this was the best and most complete book I could find. Not bad on price either.
5,Juice away,"There are some awesome recipes, as well as the area that tells what ailments each fruit and vegetable help with."
5,Love this book,"I juice every day. I love this book. Not only for the recipes but also for the info on the different fruits, vegetables & herbs."
2,Disappointing,"As much as for the condition in which it arrived as for content. The book had been crammed into its packaging in such a way that the cover was mutilated. The pulp recipes were exactly that - and there were so few that it wasn't worth the price of entry. Much better ones elsewhere. And, most of the juice combinations are common sense or available elsewhere. However, it is a good book for beginners."
1,Outdated and Bias,"A lot of the information suggests diets and foods that are not acceptable for everyone. They push macrobiotic and raw diets which are not the best. Many vegetables (such as tomatoes) need to be heated at a particular temperature enable to reach their full nutritional value. Also this book suggests many soy-based products, when in reality soy was created as an easy substitute to cow-dairy and is extremely processed. Many consumers are unaware of the fact that soy is very toxic to the body and is only nutritional when fermented (tempeh or miso). Someone who is allergic to cow-dairy should try goat-diary. Goat cells are smaller and easier for humans to digest, and has far more nutritional value and no allergens that cow diary is exposed to."
5,Awesome!,"I am a nutritional consultant and recommend this book to all my clients. Juicing is a nutrient dense way to get important vitamins and minerals. The Juicing Bible provides not only a wide variety of wonderful recipes, but also includes information on juices for specific health problems. There is a section on smoothies and medicinal teas as well. An excellent book - the only juicing book you'll ever need. A perfect gift for a health conscious friend, or one who should be. Enjoy!"
2,"Not bad, not so good, either.","I read the reviews and thought I'd give this book a try and I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed. It's a very thorough book, but I don't need most of the information it gives. And the cross-sections are daunting. I really wanted a straight 'here's how to make yummy juices' book and this is not that kind of book. Too much information and too confusing for a novice juicer. Maybe when I'm more advanced I'll appreciate it, but for now I'm still looking for the perfect *simple* juicing book."
5,Juicing Bible,"This is a fantastic book on juicing and it is one of the most complete I have seen. Tell what types of juicing that would be most benifical for different types of health problems, goes into what health benifits of each veggie or fruit you are using. I use it daily."
5,book review,"This book is full of great recipes and information about the benefits of juicing, very informative. Each recipe is easy to follow and delicious."
4,Fellow Juicer Says Thumbs Up,This is a great encyclopedic resource for juicers. As the author ofJuicing Recipes From Fitlife.TV Star Drew Canole For Vitality and HealthI can appreciate the thought that went into it's compilation and I refer to it often.I do think for the novice juicer it can be intimidating but it has a little something for everyone beyond just juicing and also including smoothies and non traditionally juiced drinks.
5,True help to juicing...,"I am a first time juicer. I bought The Juicing Bible, the book has so much useful informtion. It is truly the juicer's bible, cause its food for the soul. It will help me bring my family to a more healthier lifestyle."
2,Meh!,"As the title says not over-impressed, not under-impressed just kinda meh. I would try a different book if I had to choose again."
3,she liked it...,Bought it as a gift for a friend (also got her a juicer to go along with it)...she is a newbie in terms of healthy living and fitness lifestyle. The book was a great tool to encourage her to look at new ways to be healthy...
3,Juicing Bible,Initially the book layout was confusing and hence a disappointment. I was looking for a more detailed book. It is a good book but not good enough.
3,lots of recipes,"There is a lot of recipes but what is the purpose of it if you can't swallow them?You have to go with your taste buds and try what you like. It can gives you some basic idea and you adjust the recipes to you. Personally, I like V-8, so I take the ingredients list on it and incorporate them together + half a lemon (peeled)"
4,The Juicing Bible,Lots of information but you really need to read it and work through before you can really start juicing. I think this book is more for people who are already into juicing. Great resource and I am very glad I got it but as a beginner I tend to go to the Big Book of Juices as it is easier to figure out what recipe I want to use.
4,TONS of information!,"This book really covers, in depth, information on just about all fruit and vegetables. There are many, many recipes in the second section of the book. They are divided into fruit, vegetables and combos of both types of produce. If you're just looking for some decent recipes you can find them on-line on ""Roboot your life""..........but if you want to know something 'extra' about the medicinal/healing properties of produce this book supplies that information. There ARE some odd/exotic spices called for in come of the recipes but who says you HAVE to include them! Juicing should be simple and trekking all over the town seeking strange items takes away from the simplicity. That's the reason I didn't give this book 5 stars."
2,Not for beginners,"I bought this book as a beginner's guide to juicing. I used it in addition to another juicing book. I don't normally purchase 90% of the herbs and other speciality ingredients so this was a bit overwhelming for me. I wanted to try juicing to start a healthier lifestyle and was hoping it would be affordable, but following these recipes would have cost me a fortune. Interesting read, but not practical for me. I needed something with garden-variety normal ingredients to encourage me to get into juicing."
3,Too technical for me in all,"The Juicing Bible is really too technical for my interests. I wanted to be able to drink my a lot of the recommended 8 servings of veg and fruit without boring myself into a funk drinking V8 products.There are some GREAT recipes in there. Those were enough for me. The rest was just too much mental maneuvering, when I already take a bazillion supplements and enough Rx meds to choke a marmot.Oh,well...the recipes for the fruits and veg in the middle of the book were mostly worth it.Nice that AMAZON offered the volume in paperback at a nice price."
2,This was informative but . . .,"not what I was looking for. I was wanting a book about juicing recipes, this was secondary to the book content. I wound up giving this to a friend and co-worker is an avid health guru so I am sure it will see lots of use.If you are looking for some ideas on juicing go for Jay Kordich's ""The Juiceman's Power of Juicing."""
4,Good juicing book,I like most recipes in the book although it's not all juicing so I wouldn't necessarily call it the Juicing Bible. Overall I do like it
4,Juicing Bible,Juising Bible Very good juice recipes. Well written and easy to follow. I enjoy following these recipes and recommend it.
5,A must have for new juicers!,"I absolutely love this book! Being new to juicing, it is a great resource. The section on body systems gives the reader information about how our body functions & the diseases that occur when the system is not functioning properly.In the health condition section, it gives the reader what substances will keep the system intact & what to avoid. Information on fruits, vegetables, & herbs provides the reader with ideas on when to use & when to avoid, & how to store. The recipes are divided into fruits & vegetable combinations but also includes recipes for certain ailments."
3,Nothing groundbreaking but a solid book,"If you were already pretty familiar with what you're supposed to do as far as nutrition, even though you're like me in that you don't always follow that advice, this book, and its contents, it probably not groundbreaking to you.Bunch of recipes, and descriptions of various fruits, veggies, and herbs, as well as their medicinal qualities. For me, it was more of a summarization of what I already know, although I did learn a few things. The recipes are pretty good, but I usually juice what I have available. Luckily most of the recipes are pretty short, so if you're feeling adventurous, you're not going to break the bank trying some new things, even when buying organic produce."
3,Not what I was expecting,Needed more recipes just for the juicer. Most of these could be made with a blender. Have not tried any recipes from this book as of today.
5,A must for any juicer!,"Ideas for different health issues, health achievements, recipes, ingredient combinations you wouldn't believe. Do you have family members you can't get to eat vegetables? This book is your answer."
4,Allot of information,This book has allot of information. I just wanted a book with basic ingredients and amounts for green juicing. The book is a little overwhelming with all the information. But it does give you information on receipies for different health issues which is good.
4,You Like-a the Juice?,"The Juicing Bible has been a handy companion to my new juicer. Veggie recipies are tasty, and there are some interesting non- juicing recipies as well.My main gripe is this: No exact measurements are given. If a recipe calls for 3 carrots, in my opinion, it should give a weight measurement as well. Have you ever seen an organic carrot next to a supermarket carrot? Or better yet, the huge carrots that are used in juice bars? There's such a difference. I need a little more precision until I become a juicing expert myself."
4,Great selection of recipes,"I got this book when I started juicing. As a beginner, I got good solid information from this book about juicing and types of ingredients for a specific need. You can get what to eat and what not to eat according to your health issue. At the very end, it has section of ""elimination diet"" which was helpful to find out what I was allergic to. Now I know what I cannot eat. This book is great because there are so many recipes, not only juice recipes, but also smoothies and sauces and more!"
3,Not bad,"I guess I was expecting a book jam packed with great tasting recipes. However, this book goes into more detail on how to treat ailments. Some of the drinks are good, some taste like dirt (to me anyway). Interesting book, but not exactly what I was looking for."
5,A good place to start,"My husband and I weren't sure where to start with juicing. This book offers overviews, recipes, and specifics on tons a veggies and fruits. We started using the recipes, but soon felt confident enough to try our own blends. We don't follow it closely at this point, but there are many recipes to assist with certain issues and detoxes. Another feature we like is if we have a fruit or vegetable and aren't sure what to combine it with, all recipes with said item are listed together.Good buy."
5,Helpful,"The book really helped me to understand the reason why Peru is in the current state it is in. The first part had more details than I needed. The second part described economic principles in a very basic and simplistic way, which was unnecessary. Very interesting read and I think de Soto has discovered exactly what the true problems in Peru are from and how to turn things around. Good read."
3,Agreed -- would have been better first,"I agree that this book would have been more interesting if read before Mystery, but now the mystery is gone.This is good stuff just the same.Lots of good points that are useful in a classroom."
5,fun for my conure,This toy was a hit with my green cheek conure. He likes to shake the maracas and the bell in a fit of noise that apparently makes him very happy. Would recommend to others with conure-sized birds.
3,FCP for AVID Editors,"I haven't used the manual enough to fairly gauge how useful it is, however, it was recommended so I bought it. However, I believe the tips I've found online via Google to be more comprehensive than this manual."
1,A REAL NOTHING REVIEW,"It appears that I am FORCED to give this product a star EVEN THOUGH I never received this book I ordered from Amazon last May. Over the summer I received emails telling me it would be shipped when it was available and then, finally, at the end of the summer, one telling me that Amazon would not be able to fill the order.A third party supplier was recommended. I ordered Final ""Cut Pro for Avid Editors"" from that company and received a shipping confirmation the next day - and then a cancellation email the next day.It seems that this Avid Editor is not going to learn Final Cut soon."
3,Looks ok,"It looks very good on picture. But when it arrived home, it does not look as good as it looks on picture. Probably not worth for $80."
2,Junie is a bad influence,"This book is intended for a first-grade reader. The grammar is atrocious and it contains a lot of slang. My granddaughter asked for these chapter books and I have purchased 12 so far. On a recent visit, I decided to read one of the books to her and again was astonished at the content. I will be looking for a new more appropriate set of chapter books for a first grade reader and won't be buying Junie B Jones books anymore."
1,"Poor grammar, not pleased with the language","I read this book to my 4 year old daughter tonight. I really don't understand the appeal of Junie B. Jones. The grammar in this book is appalling. I am working to teach my daughter new words - not horrible abominations of words she already knows (bestest, pologies, runned...the list goes on and on). I was also taken aback at the choice of words. ""Stupid"", ""kill you to death"" and of course all the discussion about a rooster pecking your head into a nub.This was our first Junie B. Jones book and it will also be our last."
1,Junie B. Jones has a peep in her pocket,book appears to have chocolate milk or some foreign substance spilled and dried on cover. Very nasty.
4,tforms and metal the perfect combo,"when i heard these guys i could not belive my hears. a metal band with a transformers theme quite possibly the sweetest think i've ever heard... ever. not to mention that lyrics and instruments are really tight this a great metal album. if you like transformers and metal buy this!also i would point out that thease guys are NOT A CHRISTIAN BAND(thankfully). there are two bands called shockwave, the one with the album entitled ""High Impact"" the christian band"
5,Who says Christian music is for pus**es?,This cd is unrelenting and brutal. VERY heavy. If you think of the word hardcore this is probably what you'd hit except with a unique voice for this genre. Solid album. This is one of the only bands that can take a concept such as Transformers and turn it into a kick in the nuts. Not to mention the art is perfect thanks to member Dave Quiggle. Christian bands are slowly clawing their way to a sound that is actually good. It should also not go unnoticed that this band isn't even distinguishibly Christian: this is Disciple AD (or Martry AD? ha! IRONIC!) side project. Me? I just like music.
1,I this book as a new gift and it was a used library book!!!,"The book itself is very good. However, I ordered this book for a Christmas present and ordered what I thought was a new book. It was a used library book with LIBRARY stamped all over the page top. So disappointed in the vendor."
5,So much information!,I love this book! It has so much about cats and how to help in different ways. There is so much in the book on different ailments. The information was overwhelming but so useful. I do buy a lot of cat books and this one was one of my favs!!!
4,Good basic book for cat owners,"We do cat rescue and have recommended or given this book to many people. It's a good basic book, helps explain when to go to vet, not too hard to read.I disagree that the ""gross pictures"" shouldn't be in there -- You don't have to look at them, and they're there to teach what some things may look like. We've found some of the pictures quite useful.The argument that ""if my cat looked that bad we'd be at the vet"" is kind of off the point -- this book is good because it is a great COMPANION to your vet --Anyhow, very good book. I too wish there was a more recent edition, but much of the most changed stuff since 1995, is at a higher technical level than this book.For the next level up, Feline Husbandry, and Feline Diseases by Niels Pedersen are great..."
3,Upsetting Pictures,"I agree with most of the others who have talked about this book in terms of it's easy-to-read and informative nature. However, I found the pictures of sick kitties very upsetting and it makes it hard for me to use this book. The pictures seem like those you would find in a clinical textbook for someone in veterinary school and while others may find this helpful I wish they had excluded them since they do not seem completely necessary in order to understand the text. I would not have bought this book if I had known ahead of time that it included such graphic pictures. Anyone who is very sensitive to this like myself, be forwarned!"
1,"NOT ""advanced""","You gotta be kidding me. The vaunted U. of Chicago considers this ""advanced algebra""? Are they trying to make students feel better about themselves or something? This is nothing more than 7th-grade algebra.I believe this should be clarified to students, lest the get the wind knocked out of them when they go to high school and cannot negotiate an ""elementary algebra"" class."
3,Close Your Eyes And Think Of England,"May I say this book holds a special place in my heart as it was the text of the absolute last math class I ever had to take in my life? Even if it was just a cop-out repeat of the easy algebra I had in 6th grade, it was still math and therefore the stuff of sterile numbers, my oldest foe in the scholastic world. Anyway, though, this isn't bad as far as algebra books go. Explains things well and keeps its Satanically evil subject mostly down to levels anybody suffering through the required college math credits can deal with. Could have been worse."
3,Sony Dictation/Transcription System,"I had been using a Lanier dictation station for years and it finally broke. In looking for a replacement this seemed to satisfy. Overall, it is a very good piece of equipment. The only drawback is something that I overlooked in the specs. It does not have any way to index (electronically mark) the tape to facillitate finding previous recordings. My transcriptionist tells me the recordings are much clearer than with the old unit. It was certainly more cost-effective than the digital units available. It lacks the ability to email a recording, but I did not need that feature"
5,great skate,"I bought another brand for my other two boys and the stopper fell off within two weeks, this skate is really holding up being used outside and inside at a rink."
5,Sidewalk skates,I purchased these skates for my grandson. He absolutely loves them. The fit was perfect and the color was just what he wanted. I would recommend them if your looking for a sturdy sidewalk skate for a kid ( My grandson is 7 )
5,Perfect fit but missing sole insert,The skates were a perfect fit except the insert for the right foot was missing. Is it possible to get a replacement?
5,Saved me time buying online!,"I don't know if I paid less than retail but it was so much easier for me to buy online versus running around all day looking for skates for my Grandson's BD. Great quality, quick delivery."
5,Chicago Sidewalk Skates - Still The Best!!,"I chose the Chicago brand from past experience, and I was not disappointed. We are a three generation family of Chicago skate users, and the quality of workmanship is still there after all these years. Upon examination of these skates, I found them to be sturdy and well balanced, with excellent stops, and ""stylish"" enough to please the 9-year-old they were purchased for. I would recommend these skates to anyone who wants the child in their lives to have the safest and best skates money can buy; price-wise, you can't go wrong with these."
5,Great Roller Skates!,"I bought these skates for my 8-year-old for Christmas. He LOVES them and skates every day. They seem to be very sturdy and the wheels aren't too fast since he is still a beginner. My only issue is that the toe stop seems a little chintzy and will probably wear out rather quickly, but that can easily be replaced. I'm sure the skates on the whole will last until he grows out of them, which will be too quickly for sure. I shopped a lot and thought these were a great deal for the money and I'm not disappointed."
1,Skates,I brought these skates for my 9 yr old. The worst skates ever. The wheels are very rough and it's not durable for the outdoors. The Chicago bullet skates are 10 times better. Don't waste your time buying these.
5,My son loves these skates,"My 6.5 son bought these skates himself. He couldn't wait to get them and once he did, he rarely took them off. We live on a cul de sac and he skates as often as he can. They are wearing but that's because he is rough with them. We'll probably have to purchase another pair before too long."
4,Finally a Genealogy Documentary!,Finally a Genealogy Documentary! Our genealogy group donated this DVD our local public library in memory of a friend and felloow genealogy buff. It is a nice addition to any library or personal collection. Nicely done.
1,EEK!,"I have been using curry powder for years. I used this twice, and got sick twice. Never again will I buy this product."
1,"this one sucks, get the combo instead","Their first album (which is included in the combo)is much better than this. I thought the songs would sort of ""grow on you"" but they are just that bad! I bought the combo and never bothered to listen to this."
1,Worthless,"Does absolutely nothing to change reception. NOTHING! I get the same SW stations just as well with the radios built in telescoping antenna. Buy your self 10 ft of speaker wire instead. Also, seller appears to have bought out some old Radio Shack store. Slow shipping and package was banged up, old and dusty. I would avoid."
4,its nice wide view recommended for short shooting,"I just to own this lense and its an owsome lense the image its sharp but you must be very stable to void blurriness or else it become kind of sensitive because it does not have image stabilization but most of the times its your hands for the stability or use a tripot and fix your problems, after all from a short view and large picture its so nice i had to sell it and replaced for a canon 17mm-85mm bacause i take fast and lots of pictures most of the time on those range of mm that one fitted my need. this sigma lense its very nice for an starter photographer to learn more in angles its nice i have a 40D canon as you know its fast and i am fast alson with lenses.if you plan to take short and wide angles most of the time i recommend this lense on day time and with nice light its brillant and for night time or low light i recommend a good flash to get nice results."
1,ciencia y arte del verso,"this is a reading that i have not been able to get used to it.why would you write a book that is less, in terms of quality, than Caparros or Navarro.I hate it."
2,Not a good buy,"I bought one of these poorly designed watches a couple of years ago.The minor problem was the location of the start/stop stopwatch button - lower right on the watch. Kept being turned off when I was riding my MTB wearing gloves.Major problem was the band. Simply disintegrated in several places after just over 12 months normal use. Due to the design, it couldn't be replaced at any local shops, and to get it replaced I was going to have to send it interstate, lose its use for a fortnight and pay AU$80+!Would only be the watch for you if you're willing to have that sort of cost every twelve months or so in order to keep wearing it."
4,"Good, Functional Running Watch","I really like this watch and have purchased two of them. It has a large display with large numbers so you can just glance at it when running rather than needing to try staring while your wrist is bouncing up and down. The big downside is that the band is integrated into the watch and is therefore NOT replaceable. So when the band breaks, you can't wear the watch anymore. This is the reason I needed to buy a replacement, as the band on my first one broke and rendered the watch useless."
3,Possibly flawed for those with high water pressure,"I bought these as a replacement for the caps that came with my Orbit 58872n, but they seem to be suffering from the same problem:When the unit shuts off, it does do suddenly, with an audible ""thunk"". That sound is the water placing an enormous amount of pressure on the rest of the unit as the flow is arrested. The weak link in this otherwise solid system are these plastic caps which seal the unused hose bibs. Over time, they start to crack and leak as a result of this daily hammering combined with the fact that the plastic gets brittle in the sun.Now, thankfully, these are relatively inexpensive replacements, but this problem is destined to keep happening about twice a summer for me. Maybe offering stronger caps would solve this for me.These may work fine for you, I just wanted to share my experience."
1,Do Not buy this product,"This is the worst coffee maker I have ever used. It makes poor coffee which still tastes like plastic after 6 months of use. The feature that lets you remove the pot to pour a cup while still brewing works poorly at best, dripping coffee onto the heating surface and burning. Many times the release mechanism that allows the coffee to drip into the pot does not work, filling the basket above with scalding hot water which drips all over the place."
1,Poorly Designed and Not Worth the Money,I purchased one of these coffee makers based on Delonghi's past reputation. The design and manufacturing flaws in this machine were too numerous to go into. Suffice it to say that steam collected in the back of the base and made a mess when brewing coffee. Seams on the base were not sealed completely and the coffee pot was flimsy. I returned it to the on-line store and received a refund. Don't bother with this one! I ended up buying a Cuisinart DCC-1200 and love it - spend the extra money!
2,"great coffee, terrible service from the company","The coffee maker I purchased was like this one but instead of the thermal carafe, mine had the regular glass pot. I had purchased the item from a very well named department store in Albany, NY,(I live in WV) the day after Christmas 2001. It made the best coffee and I was very pleased with my purchase. Then about 3 months later, maybe 4 months at the most, the plastic lid of the carafe broke. As everyone knows, you can't make any coffee without the carafe lid. Because the coffee maker was under warranty for one year, I notified the maker deLonghi, explained the situation, and asked for a new plastic lid. A very nice man at the company said he would send me a new carafe since they are not able to send just the plastic lid. Seven months later I still am waiting for a carafe and lid. I have given up on deLonghi and their products and have purchased a KRUPS brand."
5,Outstanding,This series is an invaluable tool in the World History classroom. Please consider offering it in DVD.
5,Interesting!,the book Ibis is a must read. it is fun to read and it is interesting. Ibis is fun to read you should read it.
3,"Great film, streaming so-so","The film was great, how many good Icelandic films are there!My problem is with Amazon's software.First, there was pixelation on medium and long shots. This never happens on Netflix.Second, the search feature is just awful, it's really impossible to determine which films are free for 'Plus"" members.Third, there's no way to 'hold onto' films once you find them, the 'Wish List' really doesn't work in this regard.This general lack is all the more prominent since Amazon is fantastic in ever other regard. It is the number one internet commerce site, bar none.When will Amazon upgrade it's movie streaming service to Netflix level and beyond?Soon, I hope."
5,It's like trying a different cuisine,"I remember how fun it was when I discovered Indian food or Vietnamese food. Movies like foods have cultural flavors. This is a movie from Iceland, and I loved the surprises and the types of humor and drama that were portrayed just a little differently from typical American fare. The writer is known for his good storylines, and I really enjoyed the oddball casting. I can't wait until the 2nd book in the series is made into a movie. It's supposed to be in production."
4,Great folding outdoor chair,"This is a very comfortable folding outdoor chair. If you want a great looking, solid, comfortable chair that you can easily put away when not in use, this is a good choice."
1,Don't Trust these Remanufactured Ink cartridges.,"I ordered four ink cartidges 2 Bk and 2 color, The reman's were a better price than new, However when i recieved them the first bk had a crease on the printed circuit and would not function at all the second leaked all over, when i finally needed a color cart it only prints in blue. When I contacted EFORCITY they told me to send them back in the bag provided but made NO mention of a thirty day limit, I got side tracked and it took a while to send them in. One came back TWO WEEKS later marked undeliverable. When I contacted Eforcity they said they did not recieve the other and THEN informed me of the thirty day limit which does not mean much if you can't send them back. I would NOT recomend wasting your time and especially NOT your money on EFORCITY. Wes Hoffman."
2,GOOD DARK VERSION IN A TERRIBLE TRANSFER,"I basically agree with previous reviewers about the excellence of the singing (though Nucci doesn't erase memories of greater interpreters of the title role, Verret is terrific) and the movie director has good ideas (even if he considers some obscene (?) in the interesting hour long documentary on the making of the film). So why only two stars? Because the transfer of this 1987 movie is just dreadful. Colours are faded, the picture suffers from scratches and dirt and at times even looks out of focus. I cannot understand how Universal dares to release this in such a poor state. Contrary to what another reviewer states, THIS HAS NOT BEEN DIGITALLY RESTORED (not even ""apparently""). Shame on Deutsche Grammophon and Universal."
2,possibly OUTDATED or INFERIOR PRODUCT SHIPPED;EXHORBITANT SHIPPING COST,"THE SHIPPING COST WAS EXHORBITANT - IT WAS THE EXACT PRICE OF THE PRODUCT AND I QUESTIONED IT AND NO ONE ANSWERED ME!!! ALSO MY HUSBAND USES THE PRODUCT AND HE SAID IT WAS EITHER AN INFERIOR ""WATERED-DOWN"" PRODUCT OR IT WAS ""OLD SHELF-LIFE PRODUCT"" SO AFTER ALL THE TIMES WE BOUGHT IT IT IS TOTALLY UNLIKELY WE WILL AGAIN PURCHASE IT!"
2,grecian Formula,The fluid seems not fully active. I have used it three times and the results have not been darking the hair as previos use had darken the hair
4,I am hooked!,"Hunter's Moon (Half-Moon Ranch)This book is the reason I am here. When I read it I did not know it was the 1st in a 4 book series. This was a little disappointing because I had never had a book leave me with SO many unanswered questions. I loved the flirtatiousness of Brent and Crystal. I loved the drama. I was hooked at the end to read the next book. I love ""who done it"" books and historical romances, so this was a win, win! I would not recommend this book unless you were going to read all 4 installments. I'll let you know how the others are."
4,"Good story and characters. A bit ""high school"" style.","The writing style threw me on this one. I felt like I as reading a teen romance novel. However, the story line is good. The characters are likable.The story has a mountain of romance, but not enough tension to balance it. There is a nemesis, but he is not given much time to keep you on the edge of your seat. The scenes that are exciting don't last long.It's a quick and easy read. Sweet story. Not the most exciting. The love scenes are very mild. I'd say this is a safe one to pass on to your teen daughter."
3,The first of the Half Moon stories,First in a series of books about the Half Moon ranch and the family that calls it their home. This is Brent and Crystal's story.Brent is left in charge of the family when his father goes to prison for killing his mother in what appears to be a drunken stupor? Or is it? Though this is not revealed in this story there is a lot of family tension about it..It is a sweet story and I enjoyed the tale. I do have to admit that I am looking forward to seeing Abby's story though.The interesting part is that the other 3 books are not by the same author...
1,Uninspired!,"The Dukes of Dixieland's ""down by the riverside"" was, in a few words, flat, thin, uninspired (on a Bose Lifestyle 25). Several selections sounded like one instrument playng and the others providing only background music; i. e., no interplay. Others had a big band sound, not dixieland. I thought the band was trying to fall asleep. It was only $5.63, and, I thought that I couldn't go wrong. Wrong!"
5,The most confortable shoes ever....,"The Reebok Freestyles Hi are very comfortable shoes. If you do a lot of walking, stand on your feet the all day... they are perfects. I like to walk to my office and from my office every day (about 6 miles both ways) and with the Freestyles Hi I never get any foot pain.I started wearing the Freestyle Hi way back. I had twisted my ankle and they were the only shoes I could wear. To this day there are still my favorite shoes.Just be aware that sizing may differ slightly from pair to pair. My only critic is that the manufacturing quality has not always been consistent.But overall you cannot go wrong with those."
1,Dissatisfied Customer,This product is not what I expected and the company was less then cooperative when trying to return so needless to say I was out the price of the product and stuck with something that I can not use!
1,Disapointing.,"When I paid $1.50 to download this, I anticipated getting an article on the Draw-a-person test. I got a title and a paragraph, which made this cost about $.07/word. Definitely not worth it!"
1,Don't waste your time or money with this book!,"I would gladly have given this book 5 stars BUT it does not provide readers with access to the source code for the Java program examples in the book and so this book is totally worthless unless you have the time and want to spend zillions of hours typing the code into a computer yourself. People today just don't have the luxury of time to spend typing in a zillion lines of code themselves! By the way, Frank Wang's website given in another commentary on this page: http://socioecono.phys.sinica.edu.tw/icomputing/is completely useless as it contains very few applets and they are all in execute-only format. I tried contacting the author by email but never got any response. So my advice is this: don't waste your money buying this book unless you have zillions of hours to spend typing all that source code into a computer yourself."
4,"""Takes me back when times were happier""",I would strongly recommend this CD to anyone who grew up in the eighties and want to reminence about the good old days!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Watch out Bel and Escort,I was an over the road driver for 20 years and used all the major radar detectors. For the money this radar detector is as good if not better. I ran it side by side with an older Valentine One and discovered that this unit was quicker to respond to radar and laser.It is more prone to false signals.
2,PIPPEN BY AN OFF -- BROADWAY CAST,"Ben Vereen was the ONLY member of the Broadway production...He was fine, the rest of thr cast was not up to the original casr."
4,The Pippin video performance.,"Pippin is wonderful, and though I am a schwartz enthusiast myself, I have to say that Fosse blew the creative spark into Schwartz's work. The Pippin everyone remembers is Fosse's creative vision. Martha Raye is enthusiastic, bubbly, and wonderful. Chita and Ben are, as always imcomprable, William does a good job, although straining on ""Corner of the sky"". All in all, a talented cast. The video is choppy in places, but helps the audience especially one who may not have seen it before, understand what Fosse had attempted to do. To do being in the past sense, because Fosse did not direct the Canadian performance of Pippin. It was one of the original dancers that worked under him. All in all, though, the video is well worth seeing and owning, and if you enjoy Fosse, make you sure you pick up uour copies of Cabaret, and Sweet Charity."
2,Poor Quality DVD,"Warning to those who expect great recording on image and sound, this is not a superlative disc...it didn't even include a one-sheet inside with chapter titles. The direction of the project is spotty, too many close-up shots and not enough establishing shots make following the visual flow of the production difficult. And, unfortunately, the cameramen must not have thought too highly of Fosse's choreography because they cut away from it as much as possible to facial closeups. Also, the audio is horrible. On the bigger cast numbers, it actually 'blows out' on group notes. As for quality of filming and DVD presentation, this is an awful disc... But -- for those who love live theater, it's still a record of an interesting show with great performances by Vereen, Rivera, and Raye. It's definitely not a kid-appropriate piece, however. A long sex dance and a rather graphic war dance pull it out of the parent comfort zone for preteens."
4,Good record of 1981 made for television performance...,"I had never seen Pippin before, so I don't have a stage comparison. Most of the complaints are about the video quality and the sound. First, this was filmed as a television production, not for screen or home video. Some of the reviewers have forgot that fact when complaining about the video and sound. VHS was just beginning to take off and very few cinemas had multi-channel sound. I have a VHS tape of a concert film made at that time, ""The Last Waltz"" and the sound from those live performances aren't too good either. If they ever release the video TV special ""Liza with a Z"", it will probably be of this quality too. But, it's the performances that are worth watching. Just seeing Ben Vereen's dancing in ""Glory"" makes this DVD worthwhile."
2,Pippin Live Performance Review,"PippinThis was not a very good performance compared to the original live on stage performance. While Ben Vereen was excellent, William Katt did not seem right for the role. He was unsure and a bit stiff. There were several ommissions from the original production. It was not at all exciting."
4,"Ben Vareen, Ben Vareen, Ben Vareen","There has never been and has to be a dancer/actor like Ben Vareen. Fred Astaire was a different style. Ben Vareen is beyond belief. If you've never seen him in his prime (He's 59 now), here's maybe your only real chance.The show too has some great great songs. Its also philosphically a message about life and its pursuits. Best line: If I'm not attached to anything, I'll never be free"" BUT you must see the show to fully understand (Think 'Being Alice' from Company too)"
2,Don't care for the play,Bought the DVD to see the play before an audition. Didn't really care for it.
2,its...interesting...,"i just recently fell in love with the musical pippin, and after seeing it live decided to buy the video. and boy was i surprised...the only two performers that i liked were ben vereen (ASTOUNDING!) and chita rivera. fosse's choreography was great, as always, but his direction decisions really irked me. for example, he cut the pippin/theo duck sequence. this sequence established a closeness between pippin and theo, and it had some great lines :o). he also cut catherine's song ""i guess i'll miss the man,"" which displays catherine's feelings for pippin! and the video itself is pretty bad quality too, bad sound mostly."
2,Horrible edits,"In the early 1980's, when this video was produced for cable, the TV director said he made the cuts to fit the time constraints of tv. The cut material should have been restored for the dvd release. So much good material was lost."
4,Glad the Great Performances Were Put to Film,"I am so glad the great performances of this cast were put to film. Although the early 1980s live production quality isn't the greatest (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), it still captures the magic of Ben Vereen, William Katt, and the lovely Leslie Denniston.As previously mentioned, the video recording quality isn't exactly new millenia CGI (but it's good enough), and likewise the sound quality of the live performance does not match the studio audio recording - btw a must purchase:Pippin (A Decca Broadway Original Cast Album)I had the pleasure of performing the role of Pippin in 2007 and I can tell you people still come up to me filled with wonder about that show. Many people leave their first viewing of Pippin saying (sic), ""I don't know what just happened, but I LIKED IT!""Buy this video and watch it a few times, and you'll understand."
4,Too much Fosse.,"Good service. Great Fosse production which serves his career but not the piece. This DVD is not a definative version of Pippin. Good quality, good service. Overrated production of an underrated musical"
2,Good show ruined by editing,"Pippin is one of the best broadway shows of the 70's. Unfortunately, you'd never know it from this video of the show. While the cast is wonderful, the severe editing to make the show fit the length of a television broadcast ruins it. There are major jumps in story that completely delete songs, sections of songs, even complete scenes. And it's a major shame. William Katt makes a nice Pippin. He sings well and looks good in the part. Chita Rivera is great as Fastrada. She's..beautiful, devious, scheming, everything Fastrada should be. And what can be said about Ben Vereen. He's at the top of his form here in his Tony Award winning performance. Sound and video quality are good here. I just wish there were a special edition being issued that would put back everything that was cut out to fit the two hour time slot."
3,Broadway Baby Says WAAAAAAAAAH!,"I saw Pippin years ago on Broadway and loved it... I was so excited to renew my aquaintance with it when I bought the DVD! Unfortunately, while preparing to put this film on digital medium, well, they skipped the preparing part. The dvd sounds and plays like a worn out old VHS tape. It's still fun to watch but just so dissapointing..."
3,No better on DVD,"PIPPIN is a model show of its time period, a theatre piece of delightful contrasts: traditional AND unique, colorful AND dark, pastoral AND risque, cynical AND optimistic. I've listened to the cast album LP for years, always finding the songs fascinating. Now here's a professional production of the play ""to have and to hold"" on DVD. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its expectations. The performances are wonderful, as other reviewers have pointed out. (With the exception of otherwise adorable William Katt's voice breaking quite a bit.) However, the maddening cuts have NOT been restored for the DVD, and the sound quality is very poor for a DVD. It doesn't sound like the actors were individually miked, making the vocals very flat when amplified by the DVD medium. Having watched the DVD a couple of times, I decided to sell it and to invest in a copy of the original cast recording on CD :-)"
2,Terrible edit,"Unfortunately, and as usual, idiotic directors and editors have ruined a great show! Panning, zooming, cutting...God it's awful. I remember hearing that Bob was upset by it and apologized to the cast. The really sad thing is that the show, staged by Kathy Dobie, Bob's long time assistant, was beautifully recreated and then ruined by those fools filming it.. During the big ""Sex Ballet"", the shoot from behind with glaring lights so that you really have no sense of what the dance is. The sound it bad, the cutting is bad and Kat stinks. All that said, it will be your only chance to see what Broadway dancers used to look like. Get it for the history. By the way, if you want to see another show that was totally ruined by bad cutting, see Sunday in the Park with George. This beautiful show was destroyed by idiotic editors!"
2,"Good Fosse & Vereen, But Really Bad Video and Audio","I was expecting the same quality as the video disk I bought years ago, what a disappointment. This is a not a good performance nor is the video and audio production up to the level of the video disk version."
1,Not very good,"This movie was, in my opinion, not very good. I recently saw Pippin done by my high school, and they did a much better job than this video. If you really like Pippin, maybe it is acceptable because it is the only thing out there, but rent it before you buy it."
3,Pippin video....,"I had the Pippin video and thought that it was good UNTIL I caught the FULL verson on the BRAVO network. The video had a lot cut out of it. The good point of the video was the music and the comady of Martha Raye! ""Sometimes men Raise flags when they can't get anything else up.."" The Sound quality was fair. William Katt seemed to be straining on Corner of the Sky too.. If you want the full experience, check out Pippin when it will be on the BRAVO network..."
4,Manson trio,"The only compelling reason for me to view this video is see the Manson trio routine done by Ben Vereen and 2 female dancers, I was not disappointed and gave it a 5. The rest of the show is worth only a 1.The dance routine titled Women had a burst of greatness. I was looking for something spectacular from Chita Rivera but the dance sequence was quite lame considering Chita's talents."
2,Pippin,Disappointed that this was a video of the Broadway production. Looked like it was taken taped from the balcony and the sound was poor. I like the show so I didn't return the video.
4,Well...,"Pippin is a work of true genius. It's deceptivly simple at first - but after reading an essay on this show at fosse.com I soon understood the show at new levels! BUT, the video is flawed. This is not the Broadway production. This is what...ah, yes, the Canadian Revival (! ) This production was not directed by Bob Fosse. It's based on his original direction (in some sort of weird way). Even Stephen Schwartz himself dislikes this video. Let's just pray for a cast recording or video from the Papermill production (Which I've heard is breathtaking)."
3,I have seen and read better.,"Was not a 'cookbook' and was not for the newbiein my opinion. Other marketing how to books aremuch better and with the advent of Twitter and LinkedInand other Social media, this book is probably 'dated.' Thatsaid, it might not be a surprise if the Occupy folks and theIdle No more folks have seen this book and perhaps read it."
5,"System is Great. Seller, not so much.","This is a great sounding system, fits great, easy install. But be careful in your buying options or you will encounter the rudeness of wUnderCarParts LLC. I made the mistake of purchasing through them instead of Amazon to save a few bucks. When they screwed up my shipment, I found out where they cut costs- service after the sale. They were nothing short of rude and disrespectful and I will never purchase from them again. Next time I'll stick with Amazon.com as the seller. Thanks for nothing wUnderCarParts LLC."
4,"Good jeans, a little pricey.","Bought these jeans after having trouble finding jeans to fit my legs and waist (32x36). They fit good, but they had a dorky LARGE red patch on the hip pocket. I wasn't wild about it, but they are very good jeans and don't look bad either. I compared them to Levi 517's and the Wranglers do not fit as tight around the thighs and they sit higher up on the waist. Good overall."
1,Ugliest jeans I've ever purchased.,These are ugly as hell. I'm cutting them up and using them for patches for the jeans I give a damn about. Skip em.
1,Stopped working in 6 months!,"Junk. Stopped heating up after 6 months of use! Wouldn't come on, wouldn't heat, junk. AND customer sevice is a huge disappointment! Would not honor warranty because serial number indicated that manufacture date was more than one year ago!! Idiots! Top is leaky, and sometimes the pot would not perk for the full amount of time. DO NOT BUY....."
2,Looks good but no personality,I can assure you that the 'on' and 'off' LED's are as misleading to the consumer as they are to the manufactures customer service reps. They told me to return the unit as defective. When I got the new one; the LED functions were the same. Now the flimsy clear percolator top is leaking. DeLonghi should have a recall on this product ASAP.
1,Can you believe - NO REPLACEMENT PARTS?!!,"I bought this percolator because it was the most beautiful one I could find - and it made good, hot coffee. After using it for just a few months the plastic top cracked off it (we also bought the 10 cup perc at the same time and the same thing happened to it). When I called up DeLonghi they told me that my warranty had expired and they did not make replacement parts. They also did not have any advice for what I could do. I am stuck with 2 broken lids for 2 percolators that I was only able to use for a few months. I made numerous calls to DeLonghi and was always told there was nothing they could do about it. Based on this, I will never ever buy another DeLonghi product - they just don't stand behind what they make."
2,ok until it breaks,"My wife drinks coffee... I don't. We've been searching for a small percolator since she much prefers it made that way. We thought the DeLonghi was just the ticket! Pros: it's fast! makes a pot in less time than a drip machine! Cons: lots of grounds in the coffee (my wife likes a fine grind). We, like everyone else, had the plastic top break in only a few months. I was almost about to buy her another one when I found one from Villaware. I had never heard of them, but decided to give it a try. Look here: http://villaware.jardendirect.com/products_item.asp?ProductID=2093We've had the pot for 3 months now and my wife couldn't be happier! It's a bit slower then the DeLonghi, but has a fine mesh on the basket so no grounds! There is no plastic bubble to break, either!"
3,The best ( and Only) manual out there for the UZJ100,Sometimes frustrating to use because it was written with a professional mechanic in mind and for the Austrailian market. Does not have coverage of the A334 transmission used in the UZJ100 in America.
1,Manual for old models,"I returned this book because it is not a diesel engine maintenance manual,but a car maintenance manual for old toyota models.Read carefully the whole title in lowercase letters before ordering."
1,on my THIRD one,This thing does not last. I just exchanged my 2nd one (so now own my 3rd humidifier) and this one is not working straight out of the box. The other two quit working after less than two weeks!!
2,second rate - second edition,"wish I could find the first edition, this does not do much in helping with overall German WWII plane modeling other than specialty type aircraft. The first edition is what you want."
4,The shattering,"Hey,I found this book not as good as the other books in the series mainly because it was more based on Soren's sister then Soren and his friends. I think That the author should have spent more time on other characters rather then just sorens sister. Thats why I only gave it 4 stars. I still enjoyed it but like I said before found it A little annoying that they spent so much time on Soren's sisterRebecca"
3,OK...... whatever,Even though the Shattering was way shorter than the other books in the series by the end I had enough of Eglantine. The plot was so random. I am also getting tired of Soren bossing Eglantine and everyone else around. It seems like Kathryn Lasky doesn't tie any event to the next and makes up strange owl words in the middle of a book.
3,Ugh!,"I can't believe that the author of the terrific Ga'Hoole series wrote this book. Some of the characters personalities were tweaked, the plot wasn't moving in the right direction, and you didn't enjoy reading it! Soren is so bossy to Eglantine, and Eglantine is not the character that she was before. She seems a lot younger, like a little kid in the beginning, and then is like evil at the end. It was too short, too. The other Ga'Hoole books, in my opinion, are only a little better than this one."
4,female trance in the style of ian van dahl and lasgo,"Jessy's latest single release is a nice, pretty trance track with 6 mixes--but the best mix is the original! the others sort of lose the pretty trance riff. you get a radio edit and the extended mix, plus a short and long mix by Chris the Greek, a Vandoren Og mix, and a starfighter mix. most mixes are over 6 minutes long--except for the original extended mix, which is only 5 minutes and 12 seconds!"
1,not a winner in my book,This book had all the makings to be something good but falls tragically short. Not funny not interesting and it barely kept me interested enough to read it. It had some good concepts of AI but never got in depth enough with them and the characters were lackluster and boring. Read this if you absolutly have nothing better to read.
3,Nice but not as good as hoped,"I bought this reel because of the advertised capacity of 150' of cord. However my 100' 12 gauge cord spills over a little, even with the plug put on the outside of the reel. I would pay more for a wider reel which comfortably holds all my long, thick cord, but I do not know of any in this price range. Otherwise it is suitable for occasional home use."
5,This is cool dance music,"This is a really cool album from Australian Dance Sensantion ""Sonic Animation. ""Theothous? Thistler"" and ""Diderly Squat"" are really cool songs and there are heaps more. 5 stars."
3,The second half is excellent,"The First half of this DVD is no good at all, well except for a few isolated scenes, but the Canterbury Tales are not funny at all, and oxymen girls isnt funny either. The second half of this DVD is one of the funniest things i have ever seen though. It's worth the price because of the second half. Thats about all i have to say."
4,Auto shut off,"I really like this compass, it's true the display does not wash out. It's very portable. Very nice backlight for use at night.What I don't like, is the automatic shut down of the back light.When running without 12 volt adapter plug in the back lighting turns off after 20-30 secs. I'd rather it stayed on until I turned it off.another bad feature is the automatic shut down when the compass doesn't detect any changes...Several times now while going down a straight highway it's decided to shut down as I haven't changed directions.Each time you have to reach up and turn it back on.I don't have any extra lighter sockets in the vehicles I drive, so I changed the 12 cord and bought a rechargable 9 volt battery, now the backlighting stays on, and I don't loose my 12 volt lighter socket.. so I'm pretty happy.I still have an issue with the auto shut down, you get out of your vehicle for a minute or go down a long straght road and it turns itself off...too bad it doesn't turn itself back on."
1,"One step forward, two steps back...","Initially I was pretty happy with it. It gave me just what I wanted: the compass heading and the 8 point rose to indicate direction. Easy to install in the car, although, without a case or something, you can't prevent to switch on in your pocket, making it useless as a handheld.Oddly enough, during summer time and heat, it somehow freaked out and now the arrow points to the opposite East/West direction from the heading: for example, if I head NW, the heading it accurate but the arrow points to the NE.Need to find something else!!"
4,Good but not perfect.,"The compass works just as advertised installed in the car. However it has a engineering flaw when used as a horizontal hand held compass. The written direction is fine but the perimeter arrow is not accurate in any position other than North. For example, if you are going Northwest (NW) the perimeter arrow is pointing Northeast. I don't care because I will only use it in the car."
1,PNI V700,"This was the second of three different PNI compass models I have bought through Amazon, and I would not recommend any of them. If they worked right, I would love them. But all three of them will not stay on. It says they will stay on unless no change in the magnetic direction is for ten minutes. This simply is not true as all three of mine that I have bought shut off all the time, even if I just drive around the block all day."
4,Thanks Dad,"On my 10th birthday my father taught me how to use a compass. We spent 2-days in Yosemite with a map and 2 old military style compasses (the kind with the flip up site).Well my 40th birthday was Jan 15th and I now have a 10 year old. Guess what my dad gave me? Yep a V700. There is really nothing to it. Set it up once for your car and once for the trail and forget about it. My Toyota truck does not have a built-in compass so my son and I are enjoying getting reacquainted with our surroundings, this time assigning cardinal points to landmarks.I must confess that I have graduated to a GPS for my outdoor activities but knowledge of a compass is important to both 10 year olds and 40 year olds."
3,Wayfinder V700,I like it but you have to keep resetting it for handheld or car use. Once it shuts off and you turn it back on you have to set it for car or handheld. I use it on my motorcycle so it is a pain to reset all the time.
3,Which team is the NYA?,"I have the Kindle Fire and I am reading the book on the Fire. I don't know if this is a Fire issue or the book issue.I have a page showing the most consistent teams since 1993. The third team is LAN. Which team is that? The Los Angeles Nationals? The 6th team is the NYA. The New York Angels?I guess that is the N and A mean National vs American league team, so A means Yankees and N means Dodgers in my example. Near the bottom, the MON really confuses me. Is there a MoA? Is that St. Louis? What is ANA? Which team is FLO?Other reviewers have said enough about the book I just want to point on the flaws on the Fire. Some of the graphs are small and there seems to be no way to enlarge them. It's a pretty important part of this book in particular which has lots of charts. Also the charts with the mysterious team abbreviations are annoying."
3,"Pretty good read, but...","I enjoyed this book. However, it felt like a big advertisement for Baseball Prospectus, a site which I actually subscribe to and read quite often. This book didn't bring any real new information to the table that they don't already cover on their site, so if you're choosing between the two, just subscribe to their site.My biggest disappointment is that while they explain what Eqa and VORP are, in essense, they don't tell me exactly how they calculate it. I suppose they are protecting their assets, but one of the pleasure of reading Bill James is knowing his thought process in coming up with formulas that measure performance. As the Baseball Prospectus team would have it, I'm supposed to trust that VORP measures it precisely without me being able to understand exactly why. That irritates me, but it might not get to you.The book is fairly well-written and is entertaining enough to pick up if you're interested in this kind of book."
