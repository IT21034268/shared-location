2,Poor Advertising,"So the image shown for this book is a far more recent edition than the book you are actually purchasing. If you open up the details and look, the book is listed as the 3rd edition, but the image posted does not match. To me, posting the image of a more recent edition to advertise an older copy is not entirely fair. Just saying, read the details before you end up with the wrong book because of false advertising."
3,Looks promising (I Think !),"I've quickly flipped through it. Read couple pages on what the methods and strategies of the event industry.Pros: It has case studies ! So ""theoretical"" and ""practical""; Kudos !Cons: Its mainly based on the British industry as far as I read. Doesnt quite give me the international perspective in a good grasp...PS: I like the tables where they discuses the average salary of the event-executive, event manager, and event director. Search the book, Its page 245 (Salary Levels).Overall. 7.5/10"
4,Nice hat,"This hat is great, it doesn't bend easily but blocks the sun nicely. The price was great and the uv protection is perfect."
1,SHOULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY,"If you are able to access this review on the internet, you probably know just about everything this book has to tell you. It is SOOOO basic that it is truly for the internet NOVICE. You might glean a few nuggets of information, but I found 998% of the book to cover stuff I already knew. I was looking for some good information on marketing an e-commerce site, but beyond suggesting registering with search engines and gently dropping your name in newsgroups, there was almost nothing!!Another minor problem: the book was written in Britain, which is okay, except that most of the examples of web sites given are for British lottery sites, etc.I would spend my money elsewhere if I had to do it again. I finished reading the book in an hour, and was thoroughly unimpressed."
4,Short and to the point,"Mostly this book deals with the practicalities of running a business online. Most of the examples given *are* British, but the principles are the same worldwide I would think. This isn't a blazing bonfire of a book, but it did provide me with quite a few sparks and was quite responsible about what it offered me (ie it didn't go on with 'be a millionaire overnight' or 'solve all of your problems with a website' nonsense)."
1,Very simplistic information for the extreme beginner.,"This book was written for the person who may not yet have owned a computer and who may have never accessed the Internet. Buy this book only if you are the extreme beginner. I was looking for much more high level information that could be helpful in developing a serious, commercial grade Internet business. Information such as what type of technology infrastructure or technical staff might be needed to support an Internet business that gets 'x' hits a day. While the title of this book includes ""everything you need to know"", it will leave you very short on information for any Internet business beyond a simple web page."
5,Love my wireless!,"I'm very proud of my wireless, because are very good quality, even dough I dropped it, I was amazing still working, and very usefull because I can dance and sing and play the maracas at the same time, and the sound and the receipt is awesome as well, I highly recommend it if you wanna have one of this wireless."
4,Swing Dance Speakers,"Just wanted to say, I'm pleased with this product. The equipment had no problem merging with our current sound system, and the interference was non-existent. The cords from the transmitter to the speakers are a little short, but the receiver-to-headset wires are very adequate in length. The controls are simple and easy-to-use. The speaker on the headsets does have to be fairly close to the mouth of the speaker, but that's to be expected. I'm pleased with how this product is performing."
4,pretty good,Everything works great the only problem I have is that is get staticky at about 50ft instead of a range of 300ft otherwise not bad
1,Unsatisfied customer,"This headset system was not a good investment. I purchased in August and have had nothing but trouble. Two months ago, I was told that I'd have to start paying for replacements as my headsets only last 3 weeks. Very frustrating!"
1,NOT FUNNY,"It is never funny to imprison wild animals for entertainment. In order to train these animals to perform these unnatural acts, negative & painful reinforcement is often used. This is fact, and much information can be found on the web. Do you really think that a bear enjoys riding a bicycle, or that an elephant wants to travel around the US in a small trailer? These animals need to be animals ... not money making machines. Wild animals belong in their natural environments. If you love & respect animals, please do not support this type of ""entertainment"" ... instead, watch humans perform incredible feats.... at least they have a choice! Thank you..."
2,Let's be Real,"I think this is grossly overrated by previous reviewers. Comparisons to ""No Depression"" acts like Son Volt don't hold up well (Son Volt can actually write songs you want to hear over and over). As far as original songwriters, Joe Henry has it all over this act. Rusty Miller is an average songwriter, arranger, and singer. This release is OK, but barely so. Much better pickins elsewhere."
3,Not so alike look-alike,"I had been looking quite a long time to find a sulca brush like the one that had been given to me at the dentist's office; so I was delighted to find one at this great price with the extra heads. One disappointing factor: after using the real ""Sulca Brush"", I found that this one was not quite as effective because it has fewer bristles and the bristles are softer. I was glad for the extra heads, because I found that after only 3 weeks I had worn one down already--so perhaps in the long run it will not be such a great deal. If you have never used a product like this, you will probably like using it--or if you do not like the stiff bristles on the Sulca Brush, you will definitely like using this. As for myself, the next time around, I will purchase the brand name Sulca Brush."
4,Got the wrong freebie,"The Sulcus brush is good, I've used it for years. But, the brush tip has to change very often because it's very easy out of shape. When I made the order, the brush supposed with a free pack of dental pick. Amazon sent me the one with dental mirror instead of dental pick. It's a bit disappointed."
4,Latin movie,"This movie join sex, violence, murder and latin flavor. Amparo Grisales is a beatiful woman and great actress, his best movie."
3,"Respected and well-known author, but nothing new here","Dr. Walker is a well respected professor of Criminology, but unfortunately I did not find this book engaging in the least. However, this could simply be because the issues it examines are media-worn."
5,"Careful, unbiased review of the evidence","There is nothing casual about this book's consideration of racial bias in the criminal justice system. The authors offer a very careful, balanced and thorough evaluation of racial bias in the various stages of the arrest, sentencing, incarceration, etc. based on a comprehensive consideration of the evidence from numerous studies. What is so striking about this study is that the authors are able to describe this evidence in a very understandable way that should be accessible to the general public. They find that while some areas of the criminal justice system are racial discriminatory, others are not. An excellent book!"
1,How to win Souls,"Well to start, if people actually beleive what this book says they are messed up. I beleive that if you agree with this book you also beleive in mind manipulation and the SELLING of souls to further your uh i don't know religios goals. If any one feels this is how to go through life, then I feel that I should not be a christian."
4,Good if you like exploring,"I've played this game a ton and have really enjoyed it, but I believe that comes from how I enjoy just being able to drive around in a car and explore the country side. If you looking for a racing game or a game with a main storyline I would not recommend this one, but if you love to just explore and wander around this is a fantastic game!"
1,"This game blows you away, literally.","Not in a good way, it keeps you from wanting to play it forever after you've tried it once. After 120 minutes of this game I got sick, since you have millions (non-literal of course) of car choices from many dealers and you don't know what to start out with. The graphics aren't good, the terrain is nearly endless when they tried to get ""extra"" realistic, the cars won't run well since you flip at almost every turn you make. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free I advise you not to accept this as a gift even."
5,Unexpected,I had this game for Dreamcast and it was so nice. The graphics were great and the levels where amazing. I heard it was good for Xbox and with Gamecube having higher graphics processor the Gamecube version is going to be awsome.
1,"Avoid at all costs....OK, anything more than $1.00","Rather than write a long review, I'll just say that this game is awful. I played it for 1 hour, and returned it. The graphics are OK, but the collision and everything else is horrible.Trust me, you don't want this game."
3,"Pretty fun, though there are better out there.","This game is a fun game, especially in multiplayer mode - you can really annoy each other by cutting each other off or try and shove each other into rocks and off the road - but I have seen better in racing games. However, if you find one used, or at a good price, buy it. It's not hard to play - even my parents can play it ;) - but it allows simple fun in competing with friends. The one-player mode is not very engaging, and I've seen better graphics and options... but its not too bad, especially if your just looking for something to tide you over until Zelda comes out."
5,Bernard Herrmann,"This man's music has always had strong emotions within any score that he has presented i.e. Psycho, Vertigo, North By Northwest.Garden of Evil will not disappoint. C6"
2,Not very helpful for Americans,I didn't realize when ordering this book that it deals with the British higher education system. There was very little in it that was helpful to me as an American.
2,What's the Fuss About???,"I bought this album when I saw who the players were, and I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the end result fails to live up to its potential. For starters, the recording quality is muddy, and everything from Schon's guitar work to the percussion work ends up sounding cluttered and mushy. The compositions also seemed to be 'derivatives' of Santana tunes, without the freshness and excitement that made the original songs so hot. Too bad, really. If there's a plus side, Neal Schon is a more complete player than Carlos, and even when he's doing a pretty good C.S. imitation, he can't restrain his great chops, adding flavor & spice to an otherwise bland product. Gregg Rolie's voice still sounds great, too, and his sound on organ recalls the early Santana band. I hope these guys try to do this again, with a better producer/engineer, and some better tunes; they're capable of way better than this..."
5,The best Santana yet !!!,"I had fairly low expectations but was cautiously optomistic when I first got this CD.I always loved the first 3 Santana albums and although I think Carlos is a genius, one of a kind, I don't think the ensuing efforts have ever matched the first three.This one matches and exceeds! This is the Santana album I have been waiting 30 years for and Carlos Santana didn't even participate.Greg and Neal along with the other members of the best Santana band ever make that fourth album we expected when we got sidetracked by Carlos' new direction and experimentation. I have played it over and over and every cut is great.Please give us an Abraxas Pool II !!!!"
5,hidden jem,simply for any santana or neal schon fan buy this cd however you can it is incrdable.contains some of neal schons best guitar playing to date.
5,Awesome sound,"I first heard some of these songs on Spinner.com and was able to get the album later. It was only then that I learned of Schon and Rollie from Journey being involved. Was not a Santana fan before this, but enjoyed the entire album immensely."
5,I love this CD. By far one of the best hidden treasures.,"If you are true music lover than you need to add this to your collection. I love the Santana/Journey sound, and the CD adds both music types with a great Latino flavor."
5,Santana Fans Will Love It,"As a big Santana fan, it was great to find new songs from former band members. I stumbled into this album while listening to a friends collection. All you Santana fans will love this. Passionate grooves full of guitar, drums and chants."
3,"Good stories, bad typos","The range of Rick Demarinis' fiction here is remarkable. It stretches from World War II to the present. He generally tackles sick families from the viewpoints of misguided or neglected children, adults reviewing their lives or accidental witnesses. His paintbrush ranges across the country but seems to focus on the Southwest and California. Not all the stories here are winners, and the outlook in most of these tales is pretty bleak. The publication is marred by embarrassing typos."
3,Coarse Bands Work Better on Nails,I bought these from my pet grooming drill. The coarse bands work better for trimming my dog's nails. The grinding stones are too smooth and don't file much off.
3,A long lost secret...,"While most of us know Bob James for his borderline jazz/classical/R & B CD's of the 70's and 80's...this was something that was done while he was still in college. Oddly enough, my father was at the University of Michigan at the same time that Bob James was, and even was a chorus member in a show that Mr. James composed. So he knew, and now I and the rest of the world knows, that Mr. James could perform straight-ahead jazz. I'm reminded of a story my dad would tell me about how in between rehearsals, Bob would amuse people by mimicking the piano style of Erroll Garne. These sides prove that Bob soaked up the music of his predecessors like a sponge. And in addition...you get ""Trilogy""...a piece that predates some of the stuff Frank Zappa was doing by about six years!"
5,"Great Pan, Great Price","The reality is this is a $250, professional quality, extraordinarily versatile, big beautiful pan for just a hundred bucks. If you are going to buy one good non-stick pan, make it this one. It cooks rings around hhe Farberware, Revereware, and T-Fal non-stick fry pans you get at Target and Wal-Mart and will last three our four times longer."
5,Goodbye Wok,I have a Calphalon Wok and never seemed to have enough room for all the veggie's and meat. This one works great the deep sides work just as good as a wok and you have more flat area to saute in. The lid is very tough it comes in handy for steaming and holding heat to a dish prior to serving. DON'T wash it in your dishwasher you will ruin the surface.
1,Way too fast!,"I really disliked this program. They were speaking so quickly and never stopped to enunciate. There was a good deal of material where you listen to conversations and they don't say what was said (just an idea about what they're saying). They were spitting out phrases, twice on average, at a very fast speaking speed and I couldn't even get 2 of the words much less the 4-6 they were throwing at me."
3,Not Blackstock,"iread this book and was disappointed, i had expected another wonderful story by Terri Blackstock but found little of her in this book. LaHaye seems to dominate story, style and content."
3,Nice shirt . . . but,"I ordered two of these shirts at the end of June; 1 black & 1 navy, in XL. I wore them and they are both comfortable and well-made. I washed them together in the same load of clothes and strangely enough, the navy shirt shrunk a full size (20+%) but the black one did not shrink very much, less than 2-3%. I'm not sure how that could occur seeing as they had the same label, same material and washed together. If not for the navy shirt shrinking, these shirts would have rated 4-5 stars for quality and price."
2,2 different medium sizes,"I ordered 2 mediums and both of them are different sizes. One fits ok and the other is large for me. The material is average. Its ok if you get it at under 10 bucks but I dont understand how the same style, same tshirt in different colors can have different sizes. Just goes to show you the quality of the product."
2,decent quality but I was sent a dirty used one,"Decent quality shirts but one shirt I received was crumpled up inside its plastic bag and when I took it out, there were dirt stains caused by someone stomping on it with the soles of their shoes. It's like the last person who opened this package up had a tantrum and purposely left huge dirt stains all over the shirt. I am absolutely digusted amazon is selling 2nd hand products disguised as new. You would think there is better quality control in these kinds of things. What if I had this gift wrapped for someone? OMG! Beware!"
5,"Great Value, Great Product - Great Seller","This seller filled the order in quick turnaround. The board is quite useful for my needs - small performances and recordings. Does everything it says, no problems."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this mixer not even a month ago and it's already dead. I unplugged it and re-plug, nothing. Dead!"
2,"Sound ideas, poorly presented","The immensely important concept presented here, that man should mimic nature by reusing and recycling all the by-products of agriculture, industry, and human consumption, is sound. Unfortunately the book is poorly written and weakly organized. Text is repetitive, rambling, full of minor factual errors. With massive editing and pruning, this would be a good book."
3,"Not his best, but pretty good.","Joaquin Lievano was a guitar player for Jean-Luc Ponty back in the 70's. To the best of my knowledge this is the second CD by Lievano. His first, ""One Mind"" came out in the 80's and is apparently out of print. I LOVE that album, but ""Ecologie"" is much mellower, with fewer displays of guitar prowess. In fact, ""Ecologie"" was such a departure from the first album, that I was disappointed at first. But after repeated listenings, it grew on me. I would now rate this as very good background music, but it doesn't hold my attention if I sit down to listen to it. If you come across a copy of ""One Mind"", buy it!"
4,the most comprehensive stencil book to date!,"highly recommended! this book is beyond your pretty picture book. the author's essays give an excellent overview of stencil graffiti, and his list of bibliography and end notes provide the best starting point ive found for further research.it's missing one star simply because i find tristan manco's ""stencil graffiti"" more interesting in terms of the art work selection.these 2 books are essential for stencil graffiti lovers!"
2,Pop blues rock,"That's essentially what it is. It doesn't offer anything original. If you just want some background feel good rock, this is it."
2,Book needs a different title.,"I was disappointed in this book. It would be more appropriate if it were titled ""Examples of people who started their own business"". The book also gives instruction on incorporating, but you can get that information (freely) elsewhere.It seemed to me that the author was just writing for the sake of writing and making money. Nothing insightful was said.It was dry reading."
5,Better than FP's Little People,"My daughter is 2 1/2, and she LOVES Sweet Streets. She never, ever played with her Little People collection as much as she plays with her SS toys now. It's amazing!! She completely neglects her Little People now. Thank you Fisher Price, and we'll definitely be buying more Sweet Streets toys in the future!!!"
3,Not your typical Elephant Man!,"On the wire is something of the missing link between ""Battle of Armagideon (Millionaire Liquidator)"" and ""Time Boom X De Devil Dread."" The material will be familiar to Scratch fans who like his work with Adrian Sherwood and Dub Syndicate recorded for On U Sounds (although this one isn't an On U Sound production). The title track and Grim Reaper are both riddems that crop up on Dub Syndicate and Pay It All Back compilations. Sure, it isn't vintage Jamaican Black Ark, but it is part of the most creative period that Scratch had since he burned down the Ark-- certainly not the generic drek alluded to in an earlier Amazon review."
1,Not quite the best,"Very dismissable effort from the early 80s with way too much emphasis on digi-drums and ""slick"" production taking place in the pseudo-ark of some studio in Copenhagen no doubt. The main gripe with this release is the lack of reference on the cover to the recording date or specifics. Since Trojan is probably aware how low Perry's 80's work is held in collectors esteem, it is a little fradulent that they packaged this as a ""rare find"" type of Perry release. Avoid unless 80's reggae is your cup of tea."
5,gift for dad,if you have a hunter in your family..this will make em laugh..these movie have been around for years but they are still funny every time you watch them..great seller..no problems
1,David Thomas ?,"I'm sorry! But anything with the English ""bass"" David Thomas, I will NOT buy. I have never heard anything by this singer (?) that is listenable. it is weak, thready, narrow and his low notes if they are there are pinched and gravelly!"
3,not happy,I guess the word 'tumbler' means plastic but I was not aware of that. If it would have said plastic I wouldn't have ordered them. They are OK given the plastic part. The design is nice. Just make sure you want plastic cups (not glasses).
1,What Happened??????,"Let me start off by saying that this game started off really good. You start off as frodo wandering around the shire doing tasks for other hobbits. Now granted this isn't the funnest thing in the world to do, but there was almost no fighting, which was good. From that point on the game just got progressivly worse and worse. It just turned into an all out face enemy, button mash until it was dead, face next enemy, repeat. I only made it about 3\4 of the way through this game because I just couldn't handle it anymore. I would say wait for the ea two towers game but I have played that one too and it is equally as bad as this one. When are they going to make a Lord of the Rings game that actually has exploration and adventure. I know this game promised that but beyond the first 20 minutes its nothing but fighting mindless enemies until your finger hurt."
3,Hobbit sized,"This game has excellent gameplay, graphics, storyline it follow the book its an all around good game Right? Almost it has many good features but it also has a bad one it is small its very short."
1,This is ridiculous!!!!!!,It is a fake and not even a game.. it looks real but it isn't! I want my money back
2,Worse game I ever played on an XBOX,"I love RPGs. I mean I ""really really really"" love them. But this one was a big dissapointment. The game kept on freezing, the loading time was ridiculous and the items you picked up were mostly unusable by the characters who picked them up! The story line was okay, but this game was way too easy. I actually finished this one over two weekends. What a waste of money! Anyway, this game is definitely for ""kids"", mature players beware!"
3,Big dissapointment,"After seeing the movie ""The Lord of the Rings, The Felloship of the Ring""I couldn't wait till they made the xbox game for it. As soon as I figured out about the game by Vivendi I ran down to the store and bought it. Unfortanantly the game did not turn out to be what I wanted. The choice of characters that you could be was not the best. For example I was a bit dissapointed that you couldn't play as Legolas (my favorite) or even Gimili the brave dwarf. The game in my opinion was also too short. It only took me three hours to beat the game, and since it didn't have multiplayer I soon got bored with it. If I were you I would not buy this game. Instead I would recommend The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It has better graphics, and selection of characters. It also lets you play through both movies instead of just the first one."
2,The Fellowship is not a strong one here!,"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings brings us ever so deeper into the world of Hobbits and wizards. The game is design to be a RPG, but doesn't deliver. The game lacks aside elements that make a complete RPG. The game could of use more interactivity with the environment, more things to do(the game will take you about three hours to beat!) and the graphics are not up to X-Box par. With that, it does include the adventure with Willow and Todd Bonbadil which is a little good addition to the game overall, but is forgotten later in while you progress.Although it may lack in dept, it makes up with a fun engine, supposily a RPG, it reminds me of a platform: Worriors of Might and Magic, a good game, but not great."
1,Just too slow,"For this game you need more pateince than anyone in this world has.you will spend hours at a time trying to find your friends in the forest or collecting water lillies, while being atacked by 1 of the 3 enemies in the game .this is much like the book where the characters will spend 90 percent of the time just walking from 1 place to another.I played this for 5 hours and then took this game back because it was driving me to the brink of insanity."
1,This game gets one star because I have to,"I admit that I haven't gotten very far in this game. The reason is that I don't like to play this game. When I turned it on during the day, It was fun when I was helping the hobbitt village people with the little tasks they needed, but then night fall came and I couldn't see jack. So I thought I would put the game away and play it later that night. My place was black as pitch except for the light coming from the television and I still couldn't see a thing. I'm supposed to be avoiding those black riders, but I couldn't see anything. Somehow I got past that part. Then more helping villagers. That's the best part of this game. I don't remember exactly where I'm at with this game, but I doubt I'll go back.There are far better games to buy for the XBox than this one. OddWorld, Blood Omen, and Enclave just to name a few. Don't waste your hard earned money on this..."
5,A Game I Never Can Get Tired Of,"The Lord Of The Rings : The Fellowship Of The Ring video game for the XBox has so much action , that I can never get tired of playing it. The storyline and gameplay is so great in this game you'll love it!"
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"this game isn't the movie lord of the rings if that's what you're looking for, its just a bad game with bad fighting and bad everything else. get the other version with the movie lord of the rings on the cover."
3,King's Quest Redux,"Remember the old King's Quest games on the PC? Beyond the graphics, this is what this game reminded me of. True, the storyline is true to Tolkien and the graphics were great, but the whole mini-quest, running around aspect of the game just left me flat and the dialogue was atrocious and melodramatic. The controls were awkward as well. It could have been much more than it was, but it wasn't. Maybe the movie version game will be alot faster and not so leisurely in its pace. If this had been a computer game, it would have been great, but for an XBox game, you want more action and a quicker pace."
2,A dissapointment to the Xbox,"This game is not the best. It does gaet a little credit for its good graphics and control but in terms of fun factor and gameplay it copletely falls apart. I think you should rent this just to check it out. In my opinoin I don;t like, but don't my word for, get if you want."
2,Bad,"It's probably worth renting if you have an open weekend, but don't waste money actually buying it. I admit that the graphics were very good, but that can't save the horrible gameplay. Even the Harry Potter game was better than this. Save your money and buy The Two Towers game, movie version of course."
2,Lacks Excitement,"I rented this game for a week. It follows the book closer than the movie, but the task and objectives in the game are boring and sometimes tedious."
4,FUN FUN FUN!,"Yeah....I'm a huge fan of the movies Lord of the rings..so i went ahead and bought this game, even though i had never read the books. But i found this game very fun and informative about the books. I might just be a moron, but i've played this game for 3 hours and still haven't beat it yet, actually i'm only to the prancing pony. Not comparing to the book or movie, the game overall was very entertaining..ha..and i think that's the purpose of video games:)"
4,"alright, but not for everyone","this is great game, but i havent beaten it yet. the controls are quite easy to learn, but the game can get very boring. its ""do this, then do this"", a game where u dont get to do much besides what they tell u to do. u have to do stupid missions(chores) in the shire, and the game can get really easy sometimes. but i like the game overall. gandalf is cool, so is aragorn, but i think if u want a really fun game, go get the two towers. that has the fellowship and the 2 towersin the game. if u like to do missions/chores and also to do some fighting, then u might like this game, but if u like to hack and slash while being able to follow the story line, get the 2 towers, as mentioned above."
2,Tedious,"After about 30 minutes of collecting water lilies for Tom Bombadil's wife, I had to take this game back. Sure it follows the book, but as with movies, you can't make the game exactly like the book. There are many other things I don't like, but as with the game, I won't waste any more time."
1,....not very exciting....,"This game was OK... it was just a bit too boring... I got bored of playing it and decided not to waste any space on my xbox for the game so i deleted my file... the only good thing about this game were the graphics, which were very good!"
2,"Unless you are into RPG's, this isn't an exciting game",I'm the kind of guy that likes action. I play video games because they're exciting and fun (i.e. Halo).This game is pretty slow and boring. You do *ALOT* of wandering around looking for stuff that's *REALLY* hard to find. This equals BOREDOM for me. I played the game for about 15 hours or so and most of that time was spent wandering around and around the same small areas.I would only recommend buying this game after renting it. It really doesn't live up to the hype.
1,Sad,"First, if you are thinking about buying this, DON'T! I kno people on here have been saying it is really fun and all, but it isn't. I am a teenager, so maybe these others are younger then me. I was so excited to see this game, I mean it was LOTR how could it not be good? Well after about 5 minutes of playing it I saw how it could be. The graphics, number one, aren't that great. What makes it even worse, though, is how it has no action at all! I played for about an hour, got to Tom Bombadil, and was bored out of my mind. There just isn't anything to keep your intrest in the game, you just wander around trying to find pipes for the mill owner or a bell ringer to warn the people. I advise you to not buy this unless you enjoying falling asleep while playing a game. In my opinion it shouldn't even be allowed to be called LOTR because LOTR is awsome and this is no where near that."
3,"LotR Game Rocks, But Lacks","While I like the idea of a game adapted on the books rather than the movies, this one lacks something greatly. I can't believe the developers would release a game about the FELLOWSHIP, something dealing with multiple people, and there is NO multiplayer. WHY?! Oh well, I guess. Developers will keep going on making bonehead decisions like that. Anyway, the game, while being only ONE PLAYER..., is good. The way everything looks seems true to what I had read in the books, down to hurting my eyes after looking at it too long. It's fun to play, but really lacks somewhere. Hmm....."
5,The Lord Of The Rings : The Fellowship Of The Ring,"This game is a great XBox game. The graphics are mouth dropping , the sound and music are wonderful , gameplay is awsome and fun , and the storyline goes along very well with the author J.R.R. Tolkiens first book of ""The Lord Of The Rings."" The way the land of Middle-earth looks in ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" is fantastic. The orcs and trolls look very cool , and the ringwraiths and balrog of Moria look awsome. All of the other characters in this game look cool too. The characters you can play as are Frodo the hobbit , Gandalf the wizard , Aragorn the ranger , and more. This game has nothing but pure action in it , and there are thousands of enemy orcs and trolls to kill on your way to destroy the evil one ring of power in the fires of Mount Doom in the dark land of Mordor. The Lord Of The Rings : The Fellowship Of The Ring video game for the XBox deserves a good five stars because it is a brilliantly made video game."
1,bad game dont buy,i have the game got it the first day it came out the game sucks it was nouthing like i was thinking it would be. save your money for a nouther gamedont buy !!!!!!
4,Excellent overview of Soviet (Russian ) Space flight program,"The book covers the Soviet era and Russian era spaceflights in detail. Excellent reference for all space buffs wanting to keep track of visits to Soviet space stations, Intercosmos missions and satellite launches. Unique in its kind, very appealing style of writing so it can easily be read by the non-specialists in the field.The book measures 6 X 9 inches, contains 392 pages of which about 30 have a Black&White; photo. For each mission there's a small drawing of the spacecraft and the configuration of the spacestation it docked at, giving and idea in which way vessels were re-docked for logistics and visiting crews. Furthermore each chapter has Technical frames which explain launch and recovery sequences. Bibliographical references througout this fine book!"
3,Book Review,I suppose it is good. Why do they ask these reviews so quickly? I haven`t even started reading it yet.
2,Not up to Melissa and Doug Standards,The very first time we put this puzzle together one of the pieces split and broke off. It is difficult to get apart and just not up to the regular standards of Melissa and Doug products. It seems more cheaply made.
2,Not what we've come to expect...,"We have purcheased many puzzles. Usually melissa & Doug puzzle are made very well. That is not the case here. As soon as I took the plastic off I realized my prescooler could not play with it. The picture is seperateing from the backing, it is splintering terribly. We are very dissapointed. Really, save your money!"
2,disappointed,I have purcheased many melissa Doug puzzle. Usually melissa & Doug puzzle are come with very good quality. But this one is an exception. It is splintering terribly. Very dissapointed!
2,pictures easily peel off,"Overall my daughter 3 year old enjoyed this puzzle but after a couple of play, picture paper was not glued to the wood anymore. So now we are busy gluing or taping them back togehter than actually play the puzzle. I think 24 piece puzzle is better quality."
4,Beautiful puzzle,"Bought this for my granddaughter. The puzzle is beautiful picture of a castle with unicorns. What little girl isn't going to love it. I run a preschool and we have a lot of Melissa and Doug products. They are durable, colorful and the kids love them."
2,pieces fit so tightly that the edges break,"The puzzle is cute, but the pieces fit so tightly together that often when my daughter pulls them apart, the top layer of the puzzle piece (with the picture) chips off. I would love the puzzle otherwise, but we've only had it for a day and I'm already gluing six pieces back together."
4,my 3 yo loves it,"she loves putting this together, replay value high as with all melissa and doug puzzles, the frame is a plus, hold the puzzle together for storage"
4,My daughter loves this,"This is a well-made, beautiful puzzle. My daughter is very rough on her toys, and the puzzle is starting to show wear and tear, but she continues to play with it often."
5,Beautiful Fairy Tale Puzzle!,This is a wonderful fairy tale puzzle with beautiful vibrant colors! The characters seemingly jump right out of the puzzle! I purchased this item for my 4 year old daughter who loves building it over and over again. It contains 48 all wood pieces that fit together easily and a wooden tray to make building a breeze!
5,Cool Melissa & Doug Jigsaw,"Cool Set of Melissa & Doug Jigsaw. I let my dauther start from 12 piece fist after she do it very fast then i got 24 piece, she still do it very fast too. So now it's time to do bigger that way i got this."
2,Sub par quality,"pieces fir almost too snugly together, I expect them broke before child gets too old for puzzle, also fits sloppy into the frame. Not usual M&D quality"
2,Fun until it breaks,"My daughter was so excited to receive this puzzel! Unlike most M&D products, it didn't hold up. The pieces stick together and the venere with the picture started falling off with in a few uses. I'm really disappointed in this purchase."
4,A must-have for defenders of faith,"I purchased this book just for the curiosity of its title. After reading a coyuple of pages I discovered that this was more than a simple book. This was a revelation from God, not independent from the Bible but on the contrary, in full harmony with the Holy Scriptures. I am quite aware of the times we are living in and I consider myself to be an avid biblical scholar. But there was new information here, not heard of before. At least, I have never heard about this prophecies the way they are written here. For this reason, I invite others to read it and please, give me your own opinion. Thank you and God bless you all."
5,Unique Explanation about the End Times and USA in Prophecy!,"This is the first time I see a complete compendium of history and prophecy in one book. A unique explanation about the final events and the destiny of our nation in an easy to understand language. It makes the commonly seen mysterious Book of Revelations an easy to understand scripture at the reach of our hands. It gives a comp,lete insight of Christianity as a whole and allow us to make a better decision on which way we must walk ( a very necessary information for these days of religious confusion). Even science and religion seemed to be ( for the first time) compatible, destroying the arguments of the enemies of trutgh. Honestly, a worthwhile acquisition for every Christian!"
4,candle review,"I didn't like the smell as much as I thought I would. It was a fruity smell, hard to really describe it. Probably would not buy it again."
1,Weak,Have not even had this product for two weeks and it was put together so weak it has fallen off her and gotten lost. Would not purchase their jewelry again.
5,Basie's Beatle Bag is a Blast,"I knew if Basie recorded something, it's have to be great... I had no idea it would be THIS awesome. Arrangements by Chico O'Farrell are flawless, the band is flawless, and the recording quality is flawless. I'm a Beatles fan anyway, and had any other band had done a ""crossover"" recording like this, I'd have passed it..just picture Lawrence Welk doing something like this ? I tremble at the thought!!..but Basie, thats a different story.The's guys swing their @$$es off as usual, and do a fine job. Its also a rare occasion to hear Basie play the organ on a recording.All in all, a great deal no matter the price....I bought this to play in the car when I have the top down !"
3,Too biased,"Barnett's hatred for Bonaparte undermines the whole book. There is a good case to be made for Napoleon as the forerunner of Stalin, Ceausescu, even Hitler; and another that he was lucky in many key battles and that as a continental strategist he was a bad joke (his planned invasions of England, Spain & Russia were supremely crass and blinkered). Barnett makes these cases very well, but he also glosses over some of Bonaparte's achievements in administrative reform and his occasional feats of battlefield brilliance. His tone is too sneering, so that even though he has an excellent grasp of both the basics and the detail, he allows his personal prejudices to cloud his judgement. The latter chapters are well written and compelling; the book builds up a good momentum as Bonaparte descends at pace into his self-authored and richly deserved fate, but I would have liked a more objective tone with regard to the early years and the reform programmes."
2,One eyed,"Upon reading this book you would think the author had a personal grievance with Bonaparte himself! At every available opportunity Barnett slams Napolean who he makes out was slap dash in the battlefield and relied on the brilliance of some of his generals. Also the author tries to demonstrate that Napolean had little directly to do with the reforms found in France today. Maybe it was just in style that the book is written, but I just found it to be too one eyed to be taken too seriously."
5,On Target,"Although I still enjoy #2 in The Destroyer series, this book is the one that charted the course to Remo and Chiun's long running success.The story is good, but the best thing about this book is the beginning of the relationship between Remo and Chiun. The humor in this story stands up after 30 years. Although the story is somewhat dated now, this book deserves a read."
1,if you weren't a racist you'd have a good book.,"I really tried to continue reading this series despite some of the racist remarks by the characters, because that was the character speaking not the author. However when the narrator makes comments about ""lowering the welfare rate"" by killing Black men or ""lowering the crime rate"" if these men happened to be coherent; I couldn't go along with that. It gets one star because I'd like to love the series; it is fun, but I can't sacrifice my self respect."
2,"Was not impressed by Suzanne Andrews, I expected more.","Functional Fitness: Younger in 30 DaysThis was extremely slow and boring. I bought three more of her DVDs but haven't had a chance to view them. This one I was very disappointed in, since they wrote her up as a Phsyical Therapy guru and I don't think she's got what it takes. Very, very disappointed in this DVD. I never got through it as I was aging faster then she could move."
5,Perfect,"This book was purchased at the exact time I needed it-after I interviewed with my recuiter. Dillon did an excellent job of explaining what exactly I was getting into, how long it would take, and how to handle any snags along the way. Read it and then give it to your parents."
5,Tells you everything it could,"I read this book while going through the application process for the Peace Corps, and then found a copy of it in my host country while serving. Several other volunteers and I sat down and read pieces out loud to each other, expecting a good laugh, and were surprised at how good we still found it. It is very thorough and very accurate. As to one reviewer's note that it left them with unanswered questions - well, you must understand, even within one host country, people have very different experiences, and the Peace Corps is in about 80 countries. What this book doesn't tell you, you can't - and don't need to - know beforehand. Read it, pack lightly, and go with an open mind."
4,Must-Have,"This is great, easy to read and easy to refer back to book about the Peace Corps. Answers all the questions and a must-have for people considering pursuing the Peace Corps."
4,good preparation for a long strange trip it will be,"I read this book after returning home from serving two years in Central Asia. It answers a lot of the questions many wanna-be volunteers will ask, even silly questions. I was surprised when I met many of my fellow volunteers who had never been briefed by recruiters as to many basic things, such as being able to choose what country or region to serve. This book will help out. I would also suggest reading 'River Town', 'The Village of Waiting', and 'Taxi to Tashkent' for personal memoirs of various volunteer experiences.Taxi to Tashkent: Two Years with the Peace Corps in UzbekistanRiver Town: Two Years on the Yangtze (P.S.)"
5,THE source for answers,"If you have questions about the Peace Corps, this is your answer. After combing the internet and all the libraries around me for answers to specific questions, (can I visit the states while overseas, how far apart do volunteers typically live from one another, what kind of supervision/support are you given, etc.) I've yet to find anything that even comes close to the clearness and completeness found here. This book answered so many questions I wish I'd thought to ask."
5,A wealth of information...,This book offered a lot of basic information on issues I would never have thought to ask about. I found it helped relieve many anxieties about applying to the Peace Corps.
1,Where is my stuff ??,"Don't waste your time. They will get your money if you buy something from them. They loose me as a client, but also all the people that I know."
5,Great book,"I really wanted to ""wow"" my friends by customizing the Windows shell. I bought this book and was able to do all sorts of great stuff. I now have my own screensavers running and a shell extension that I wrote which displays the Pokemon cards I've collected. The whole book was pretty easy to understand."
1,De lo peor que he leído,"Es el primer libro de Marcela Serrano que intento leer, y con seguridad será también el último. Los problemas que presenta esta novela son múltiples; aquí sólo menciono los principales:- Un desarrollo tedioso que nunca atrapa al lector. La trama no existe, es un encadenamiento de historietas sin interés.- Una protagonista carente de todo atractivo y cuyos sentimientos nos pasan de largo; sus razonamientos y conclusiones parecen sacadas de una revista femenina de cuarta.- Un lenguaje que hace alardes de profundidad y se pierde en un enjambre inentendible. Y cuando no está tratando de impresionarnos, el lenguaje se pasa al otro extremo y es deslucido a más no poder.- Una miríada de personajes que al final se confunden, porque ninguno está lo suficientemente desarrollado como para identificarnos con sus historias.Realmente, un libro decepcionante por donde se lo mire."
2,Una desgracia,"Lo mejor que puedo decir de Marcela Serrano (de quien he leído, por curiosidad o por trabajo, tres libros incluido éste)es que no ha cometido el error de hablar sobre mundos que claramente no conoce. Su tema son mujeres de cierto nivel, moviéndose en ciertos lugares, conociendo a cierta clase de hombres, y siempre sufriendo y filosofando sobre los mismos temas. En todo lo demás, este libro es una desgracia. Aburrido, cargado de pretensión, de lenguaje limitadísimo y con una historia que parece sacada de un reportaje de revista femenina. Si -como dice la publicidad- este libro sirve para entender a las mujeres, eso explica un montón de cosas sobre mi vida sentimental."
1,eugene malson,this vise is a total boat anchor the castings were not finished nothing seem to be straight could not adjust gibbs and get it to work right
4,ranging from good to great,"Concerto no. 2 in F major and Concerto no. 10 in D minor are the best of this selection from the Op. 6. I think these two works (together, perhaps, with no. 7 in B flat) to deserve comparison with the Bach Brandenburg Concerti (which are of course the pinnacle of the concerto grosso genre). They are complex, sophisticated, and possessed of an impressive expressive range. This is very emotional music, true to the wont of the Baroque: look elsewhere for something quaint and decorative.The other works here do not quite attain to the standard of nos. 2 and 10, but they are nevertheless thoroughly satisfying pieces and obviously the work of a great master. The performances here are generally lithe and effective, though perhaps just a touch lacking in emotional involvement every now and then. This last is only a very minor complaint, however; I heartily recommend this album."
5,Pure and clean taste,We love this as it is the real thing and healthy for you. It shouldn't be wasted on the plate without enough pancakes. It's too expensive to waste! Use it like gold and it's well worth it.
4,"Good Book for C/C++, Interesting For Others","This book is an in-depth discussion of issues involved in getting C/C++ code from one platform to another. Hook dives deep into arcane topics such as processor memory access alignment, floating point operation platform differences, and exception handling. The book's not for the faint-of-heart, and it's rather specific to C/C++; however, readers brave enough to push through the book should get interesting insights regardless of what platform and development environment they're working with.This appears to be a great resource for folks who are actively porting software. It's a very good guidebook of issues to address if you're even thinking about porting. I'd also say it's a good skimming read for most developers if only to get an understanding of some engineering principles to consider when building your systems. You never know when your platform might fold or get deprecated."
5,A good addition to my book collection,"As a full time system administrator I don't get much chance to program, but on occasion I have to write little utilities that something like Python or Perl might be too slow for. The problem is that I work on a mixed network of Solaris, AIX, Linux, and Windows machines, and since I'm not a full-time coder it takes me a long time to figure out how to get something working on one machine to work on another. Write Portable Code has been a great resource and I've already avoided a few potential hair pulling bugs that I didn't even know were bugs!My only complaint is that it doesn't get into deep details about moving stuff like sockets from Linux to Windows, but if Mr. Hook did this I'm sure the book would be 2000 pages long.I'm surprised no one has written a book on this topic yet, but I'm glad this one is available now."
4,"Great content, very deceptive title","This is an excellent book about writing C and C++ that it agnostic to the operating system. It is not a general book about writing portable code. Nor is it, as the sub-title explains, about multiple platforms, if your idea about platforms includes different programming languages. It's about C. It's about C++. And it's at the operating system and process level. And that's it. And that's enough. What's sad is that someone, probably not the author, felt that it wasn't marketable as just ""Writing Portable C and C++"". Great content, horrible title."
4,Lost for the English language?,"This is a very good adventure book. Captain Grant is lost at sea, and nobody knows where. From a partial, damaged message, his children and friends try to figure out where he may be. This takes them first to South America, the remote parts of Argentina and Chile. They experience wild adventures, but can't find him. Ultimately, they go to Australia and New Zealand, adventure after adventure. Though not one the most famous classics by Verne, this is a very good book, interesting to read, and fun. It is a pity English-speaking youths can not enjoy it."
5,Very nice!,excellent overal quality.it is huge so you can put your dslr camera with lens attach to it and fits easily also you'd have plenty room for 3-4 more lens unit also those walls inside the bag is removable so it can be modified the way desired.for it's price it is offering more than expected.strongly recommended.
4,Beauty,"This book is really sad, when the horse, Beauty died. Luke's horse, Beauty were best friends, and were really close. Until one night when Beauty escape from her pen and went outside into the stormy night. Then Beauty accidently went into a trap, that made her cried out loud. There was no chose for Luke. He had to kill Beauty. So he shoted Beauty in her head where her star was. At the end there was anther horse that looked like Beauty, with a star on her forehead. A memory of Beauty."
4,Best book in the world,This book is one of my favorites. I think that ever kid needs to read this book. It sounds kinda like the way I got my first horse. The book is very sad. I even cried at the end. This book is awesome. So Read It.
5,If you like good book you'll love Beauty,"It was about an old horse that became Lukes best friend.he'd told her about his hopes,dreams,and he knew that secrets with beauty will never be revealed come visit the wonderful journeys of this book Beauty.I loved this book because it showed me that friendship has no limits. It showed me the meaning of carring for your loved ones."
4,Wonderful Horse Story,"I read this book for the first time when I was a horse-crazy little girl. I absolutely loved it then and I still enjoy re-reading it. It is a wonderful story, especially appealing to horse-crazy children."
4,Badger Airbrush Rocks!,"Bought this airbrush for $60 during the Cyberweek madness. It's been very very good to me, allowing me to basecoat a ton of miniature wargaming figures for Warmachine, 40K and the like.Only downside is that the bowl is a little too small, since it also has to work with the provided bottles, while the bottles seem to need more pressure than I want to use in most cases.I also just sent this in for service. Despite the mistake being all mine, and admitting to such, Badger fixed it, and sent it back free of charge. Definitely a company that stands behind their products."
3,air brush,It is good for wide spaces but as you go smaller it just does not do well. I need to get a better one for more detailed work.
4,"Best vitamins, but way too expensive and must SHAKE with juice","When I've taken All One, I never got sick. I've compared their ingredients and amounts quite closely with all others worth considering, and they come out #1 every time. But they're far too expensive for most of us -- and far more costly than the versions of All One for younger people. Seems stupid, inconsiderate and irresponsible, to me. Our excellent local nutrition store carries All One, but not the Active Seniors Formula, because nobody will pay that much. You also must SHAKE it (not stir) in juice. If you can't swallow pills, this is an advantage. To me, it's a hassle."
4,service & quality,"Packaged well and delivered promptly... the scene is so much more vibrant and colorful in person. It's absolutely beautiful and gave a wonderful conservatory affect to the room. I recommend getting help from a friend when you put it up, however, because it's a little bit more difficult to apply than wallpaper and you will have to be quick about smoothing out wrinkles. In all, it's a good value for the price and really sets off the room."
5,Not so much Rained Out as it is a Parade.,"What an absolutely amazing album. Each song fits perfectly together, yet they all have their own sound. After my first listen to each song, I'd think it was my favorite, but then the next song would come on and it just kept getting better and better! This album is in no way lacking, from the blues-rock vibe of Bootleggin' to the slow, melodic rhythm to 40 Watt Moon. There's not one song on this album that I didn't like, infact there wasn't even a song that I didn't love. R.O.P Rocks!"
5,Twin of fire,Excellent story. Wonderful and romantic. Wish more men were like the men in this book. I would recommend book to my friends
2,Can't get over how STUPID the Hero is,"The Hero, Leander, cannot tell one twin from the other. He knew them most of his life. Houston's hero, Kane, could tell just by looking at them, and he just met the ladies. He even slept with the ""wrong"" twin! Not very believable! And some reviewer for Twin of Ice said Kane was stupid because of his poor dialect!"
2,Come on Jude...........,"What were you thinking when you wrote this? I love most of Jude's books but this book left me super dissapointed!! This book was a total let down from Twin of Ice,which was an awesome book! I hated Leander,I tried to like him,but just couldnt. I also found it hard to like Blair. This book also really irratated me b/c it seemed like every time it mentioned Houston, it did nothing but diss her and made her seem like all she was was a Little Miss Priss that only cared about her manners and the way she looked. Which there was WAYYY WAYY more to her than that.The only time I liked this book was when I was able to close it at the end and put it back on my bookshelf. Dont waste your time."
4,Houston has the better story,"I liked Twin of Ice better, but I was glad Jude Deveraux provided us with Blair's point of view as well as Houstons. It was like reading the same story just with the other twin in the background. I related with Houston more than I did with Blair, although I liked Lee as a man more than I did Kane. I felt Lee was a stronger and more handsome character. I liked Twin of Fire, dont get me wrong, but it wasnt as good as Twin of Ice.I recommend to all those who want to read about the dynamic Chandler twins to start with Houston first."
5,Brother MFC-8440,"For it's price, just over 240 bucks. I am VERY pleased with this multi-function printer. The first one fell off the desk when the desk collasped. After this the right side of the control panel stopped working but I could still use the printer from the PC controlled ""Control Center"". I ordered another reconditioned unit which again is just perfect."
5,Great product owned two of them..,"I purchased a brand new MFC-8440 1 yr ago and continue with excellent usage. As my business grow, I needed another one so I thought let try the Remanufactured one and see if it is worth the price compare to a new one. So far i had it for 2 months with no problem. Work just like new!Overall, it great. the only thing I wish it had network capability. Hey, can't have it all"
4,Unique Format Elevates this Book to a New Level,"Julia and Patrick are best friends in this book set in Plainfield, IL. The two are working together on a silkworm project that they hope will be displayed at the state fair. Unfortunately, Julia, whose parents came to the United States from South Korea, is less then enthusiastic about the project because she feels that silkworms are too ""Korean"" and so she attempts to sabotage their project. What makes this book unique is not only Julia's voice, but also the discussions between Julia and the author in between chapters. Any aspiring writer would do well to read this book as Park offers excellent insight into the writing process, while those who just enjoy a good story will also be satisfied."
4,Very Weird But Good,"I like the story to the book but thought that it was dumb to do a project on Sikworms. In the middle it talked about being racist. I really didn't like that subject. Overall the book was pretty good. I think the part were she has to kill 5 of the worms was sad becaue she grew attached to them. Her partner, Patrick, knew and told her to read the book but she didn't. I think this book should be read by people in 5th grade or higher. In the book also there is a part when the main character talks to the author and it is really cool. If you like to read informational/fiction this would be a great book for you."
5,My daughter loves this book!!,My daughter had this as a book project for school. She couldn't put the book down.She read it twice!
2,Not enough support,This pillow is too soft for me and doesn't give me enough counter pressure to offer the support i need for my back. May work well for some people though.
3,Lumbar half roll,"The lumbar half roll is sized right but it's a little too soft to be effective. If the company would stiffen it more, it would be much more effective."
5,Best half roll for the price,"This is the best half roll for the price that I have found yet. The width (i.e., in the human body width direction) is just the right amount without being so much that it wraps around you and presses in on your kidneys in chairs with curvature. And the elastic strap is of appropriate length.As for the amount of support, the decision to get a half roll versus a full roll really depends on the chair you have in mind. Many chairs already have a little lumbar support/curvature, but it is not enough, so I find a half roll to be perfect to get it to the right amount of lumbar support. I find a full roll on a chair with some lumbar support to be too much. However, if you have a truly straight-back chair, you may want to get a full roll."
1,Strap too short,Tried to use this product at desk and car seats. Strap is too short to go around the chair back. Not recommended.
1,No Support,"This product is not worth buying, it has very little support, the foam is to soft and the strap is too short to go around the car seat. Don't bother."
3,"Okay, but nothing great",This item is okay for a little support. It's not firm and flattens quickly. I had to buy another item because I got if for lumbar support.
5,Great lumbar support,"My daughter needed this product so she could sit comfortably at school. Lightweight it fitted easily into her school bag and gave her a firm support in the lumber region. She's very happy, and that makes me happy!"
1,product is worthless,"I order this to help support to help with my back, however it compresses into almost nothing when it is in use resulting in no support. Will be returning it as soon as I get a chance"
5,lumbar pillow,"bought this item for my husband, who has sciatic nerve problems, he uses it at home on his favorite chair and loves it, it really helps!! Great product"
5,Wonderful,My father is a musician. He recalled seeing Hoosier Hotshots in films. He once shared with me that he would like to hear their music again. I gave this music compilation to him as a gift. It made him happy to hear these songs again! It meant a lot to us that he could hear them again! Thanks!
4,Not all bets are straighforward...,"The story starts out with Sir Alex placing a bet with his friend Sir Edmund that they could get a kiss from someone the other chose. This is apparently what happens you have bored ton members. But what Sir Alex doesn't count on is his chosen mark's sister Emmaline. Emmaline has decided spinsterdom is for her mostly due to her fathers sly manipulations, and she is going to see her sister wed well. Well Sir Alex has quite the reputation and she sets out to make sure that he doesn't interfere with her sister and at the same time feels quite an attraction for him herself. There is also intrigue, talk about twins, service to the Queen, and even some misunderstandings. It is a fun story to read and follow how the ""opposites"" attract."
4,Great resources for teachers,"As a toddler educator, I am always looking for new ideas to use in my classroom that are age appropriate and fun. This book is literally packed with great ideas! It's organized by month with ideas for every level of toddler development, from self awareness and body concepts to critical thinking skills. Tjis book is a must for teachers and parents of busy toddlers."
3,Okay,"I bought this to get ideas of projects to do with my daughter. It's nice that it's broken down by month so the activities are relevant to the time of year. However, there's nothing really unique in the activities and you could probably get the same ideas by just doing an internet search for toddler activities."
3,"If you liked this years songs,buy this album.","Dove Awards 2000,is an ok song with all the main hits from the year 1999/2000. DC talk starts things off with ""Consume Me"",an excellent song,and probably one of the better ones on the album. After that things slow down,and tend to drag out. The album doesnt really kick off again until the end when Sonic Flood (I want to know you-is my favorite on the album),and Home With a view,by John Elefante. Buy this album if you like kind of slow laid back songs,if not stick to the ""WOW:best of christian..."" series."
4,Entertaining read,"I already have a three year old, and I am expecting another, so I couldn't find a book with something that I didn't already have. I picked this book up because it was comic relief. It isn't particularly insighful or very informative, but I don't think its meant to be. I think she's just trying to give a new mother something to laugh about, which I did. The illustrations are cute, and some of the things in there are laugh out loud funny. I would recommend this if you are tired of all the other baby books and you want to smile for a while."
1,Nonsense,"If you want to waste your time reading a book that teaches you nothing, and isn't funny, this is your book. Im easy to please, but this book was just silly and not in a good way. Even my husband tried to read it....he said I wasted my money and I would agree."
2,Takes a joke too far,"I received this book as a gift, and at first found it to be cute and funny. However, the author really takes the jokes about life with a baby too far. The book started to make me feel horrible about the choice I made to become a mother. Since I was pregnant while reading the book, the jokes didn't seem so funny anymore. I had to stop reading, because the book just focused on the ""doom"" my life would become once I have children. Not a happy thought for those of us who are expecting."
5,laughter is good medicine,"I thought this book was hilarious! It was so fun to read, and it felt good to be able to laugh about all the many trials of being a new mom. My husband has enjoyed it too, and we laughed hysterically at some of the things she wrote in there. This book is purely pleasure reading, which is much needed reading relief after studying all of the serious parenting books. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a good sense-of-humor and ability to laugh at themself."
5,This is how it really is!,"Best ""New Mom"" book ever! I share this with all my new moms-to-be! Forget the ""What to Expect..."" book -- this is the real deal!"
5,Simply Awesome!,"I bought this book thinking it was going to read like a text book, boy was I wrong. But wrong in a good way. I love this book. I am constantly chuckling at the lighthearted approach the author takes. I am already planning on gifting this book to two of my best girlfriends as I am sure they will love it just as much as I am. The book is full of things that we all think about , dread, or wonder about and gives a fun way of dealing with them."
4,"Little hard to understand at first, but makes you laugh.","I bought this for my wife before our child was born. We really didn't get it at first cause it has a lot of sarcastic inside humor from people who have been through parenthood. Now that we go back and read it, its pretty funny!! Sometimes when something happens we say, ""hey that was in the poop book!!I would reccomend it to new parents, but would tell them to read it and not expect to understand it untill it actually happens."
4,Elegant leather frame,"This is a well-made green leather frame from Royce that holds two 5x7 photos. With vinyl sheets rather than glass to protect both photos, it is ideal for travel."
4,Who could deal with such a Christlike character?,"The answer ,of course, is no one. Think of an innocent (the simple Prince Myshkin) sitting in the same compartment as the romantic wastrel, Roghozin on the Petersburg train. Both know some of the same people, and the name of the seductive Nastasya Fillipovna is brought up. Roghozin is obsessed with her and has lost his patrimony over the temptress.Myshkin, a mystic and an epileptic, makes his way thru various stations of the Cross, while Roghozin( a combination of Peter and Judas) undergoes his own failures and temptations.Truly this is a multicharactered, philosophical novel with a tragic ending that exposes all the follies and foibles of humankind. In other words, a typical masterpiece from the master of masterpieces. Read Dostoyevsky, or deprive yourself of the greatest novelist ever. Even in translation he comes across as the Shakespeare of prose. Don't be an idiot; read The Idiot."
1,Worst Novel I've Ever Read,"I ordered this book based on my desire for a Russian novel and the positive reviews here. I am an avid reader and literature lover, but I regard this as perhaps the worst, most interminable novel I have EVER read. I feel as though I've been Fyodor-boarded."
5,the voice of an angel...,"Danielle Rose's debut CD is superb in every way. The lyrical content is both spiritually comforting and challenging - some of the most insightful, truthful songwriting I have come across. Danielle's music is played in a simple, folksie style, reminiscent of Jewel, Sarah MacLachlan, and the Sundays...and the quality of her voice is certainly on par if not better than those artists. The overall sound is fantastic, and at times rather diverse, spanning from Pop, to Gospel, and even to a bit of Country on one track. Songs like ""God Is"", ""No Greater Love"", or the strikingly beautiful acapella tune ""Shelter Your Name"" will stick in your head through their catchy refrains, while other tracks such as the title track, ""Defining Beauty"", are deeply reflective and meditative. Do your self a favor and buy this album! The music will touch your soul, I promise you."
4,Great for the toddler set,"I bought a pair of these, along with assorted other noisemakers/instruments, to amuse toddlers at a Christmas party.I was pleased by the overall sturdiness of these tambourines, and they have a decent sound (not great.) My son enjoys banging them.An added bonus -- they are relatively small and light, so my son does less damage than he might with a real, wooden tambourine, when he bangs something other than his hand.If you want to put together a toddler band, a couple of cheap kazoos and some ""egg"" shaped shakers are also good additions."
1,Lethal,When this tambourine was removed from its packaging it immediately fell apart into many potentially lethal pieces. It should be recalled.
1,Huge LMI monogram,I purchased these as part of a party favor set for my son's 2nd birthday. I was shocked when they arrived and they have a huge LMI monogram on the drum. It is ugly and I am now having to cover them up the a sticker. Very annoying.
3,Should have been so much better,"I have to agree with the last review. I too am a massive fan of both EPMD and Parish. This album should have been so much better than it is. Two legends of hip hop, Parish Smith and DJ Honda combining their talents should not a poor album make. The Cd is quite short coming in at just over 40 minutes (made up of quite a few skits) and duplicating some tracks on Parish's LP The Awakening Cd. I have to be honest and say that i felt a little ripped off by the aforementioned and overall got the impression more care could have been taken over the album.On the flip side the LP does some have good tracks on it which is why i have given it a three star rating. However given the talent on this album this should have been ranking up there as one of the best Parish has done to date."
3,(3+half) Connecting nicely,"The only bad points with this album is that 2 tracks appear on PMD's solo album ""the awakening"" and its only 37mins long. Apart from that, its excellent. Head nodding, bone crunching beats by HONDA and the real b-boy lyrics by PMD. I agree with the other reviewer that its no classic but there is definitely enough here for any real hiphop fan to feel. Although most of the joints are just under 3mins long they are str8 to the point and very much designed to get you amped. HONDA's cuts on every track are as sharp as a ginsu and PMD's rhymes seem to have got tighter+more passionate than his last material. Standout cuts are ""beginning to end"", ""who could you trust?"", ""rhyme for me"" and ""constant elevation"". Worth having in your collection, especially if you're an EPMD fan but not at that ridiculous price so try cop it on the cheap."
3,unexpected dissapointment!!,"i am a huge fan of EPMD, and PMD's 'business is business' is and always will be one of my top 10 favorites, but this album was just a big dissapointment. Dont get me wrong its not a terrible album and there are others far worse i just expected more from parrish, espically teaming up with dj honda. All and all, its a worthy album for listening but its no classic"
3,Missing Raisins,"Kashi Heart to Heart Instant Oatmeal, Raisin Spice, 12.1-Ounces (Pack of 6)This an oatmeal that my husband loves. Unfortunately we're not able to purchase it in our area so when I order it, I usually order at least two cases. The oatmeal in one of the last cases we received had no raisins. My husband recently finished the last box of the first case and there was not one single raisin in any of the six boxes of oatmeal. (He hasn't started on the second case yet) I wrote to Kashi and told them that we had an entire case of oatmeal with no raisins. They responded with an apology and a coupon for ""a"" free box of Kashi oatmeal. While I appreciate that, we had an entire case with no raisins, not just one box. We're hoping the second case has raisins or we won't be ordering this product again. It's too expensive to have only half the ingredients."
3,Rather...Plain,"I got these because they matched the rest of the Riedel Wine series glasses that I own, but am not overly expressed with the look. In my mind, Champagne glasses should be elegant, light glasses which serve to lift the experience of drinking the wine. These are very large, straight glasses which do not excite me in any way. As another reviewer noted, these are big, about as tall as my red wine glasses, which have a huge bowl, yet the bowl on these is straight and uninspired. It looks like they took a stem, created a curve on the bottom of the bowl, then just left the rest of the bowl unfinished. A gradual curve narrowing towards the rim would have given the glass some shape and elegance, something these desperately need. This is one where Riedel glassmaking does not live up to its name in my opinion."
4,No damping,"This product does have the strength to close light doors and even heavier ones, however it offers no damping. If you have a door which closes freely and may be damaged by shock, this product may close it too quickly and cause damage. A hydraulic door close may be more appropriate in that case, which would offer power and damping while closing."
4,Very Entertaining/Informative -- but my dogs say no way!!,"O'Farrell has put together some helpful advice surrounded by interesting tales and great pictures. He provides wonderful insight into the man/dog relationship, but sometimes loses sight of the fact that it's now quite as simple as he makes it sound.No doubt that this a far more interesting read than most ""dog"" books, but don't expect it to be the ultimate training guide...By the way, if anyone knows how to train two strong willed GSDs..."
3,"Great Idea, But ...","Good news: The Dark Horse web page lists this as the first of four volumes, each covering five years of Raboy's time on the strip (Spring 1948 to his death in Dec 1967).Bad news: Customers should be aware that these are black and white strips, not coloured. Given the often bizzare colours chosen for non-US strips, that may be a good decision, but imo there would still be a demand for a collection of Raboy's Flash as it appeared in US Sunday pages."
4,"Mac Raboy's Flash Gordon, vol. 1","Excellent for readers who were fans of the Mac Raboy era of the comic strip. I prefer Raboy's work to Alex Raymond's. Both were fine artists, but Raboy's drawing style is a bit more sophisticated, and his story-telling was less corny. (Raymond worked in an era when it was apparently considered necessary to constantly heap praise upon the hero.) Of course these stories have the episodic structure that all collections of this type have, a result of originally being published in short installments in a newspaper. My only real complaint though, is I wish they had chosen to reprint them in color (as the orignals were), rather in than black and white."
3,Not too Shaby,I can't say the book is 100 percent up to date --agreeing that the media portion is definitely not-- but the concepts and theories covered in this text are still very relevent and I am a firm believer that this is a wonderfull text for an Adolescent Psychology class.
5,A real easy approach.,"I found the book very useful for brushing up one's knowledge of trigonometry.It gets down to the point right away without wasting any time on unnecessary theory.After all, its your problem solving ability that counts and not how well you know the theory.:)What I like most about this book is that it treats the subject matter from a student's point of view (like it teaches you how to get the answer using a calculator STEP by STEP.....it actually tells you which buttons to push).Also, throughout the book ,the application of trigonometry in surveying, construction,astronomy and air-navigation is emphasized.I recommend this book for anyone who's taking computer science/engineering/technology courses in college."
3,Summer School REview,I used Schaum's for a Summer School Trigonometry course. It doesn't replace a textbook but it covered all the necessary topics effectively and provided a good alternative to derivations and problems found in the text. I relied on it as a backup and a good check on the work being covered in class.
1,Piss Poor Book for Learning,"I had to have this book for a trigonometry class, and it sucks. There were so many miss prints in the book, that it was actually a disgrace, and I personally think this book is unfit for learning. There are way too many miss prints in this book, and it is piss poor at explaining concepts and how to work problems. When I went to study for a test on graphing sines, cosines, and tangents, I actually had to look the material up online because I could not understand the book, and almost everyone that's in my class says that they cannot understand the book all that great, so I know it's not just me, and my professor even went so far as to say that the book had a lot of miss prints. If you ever have to buy this for a class, BEWARE! My best suggestion would be to buy an alternate text that's a lot better if this is a requirement for a class."
5,Ann Sweeten and her music,"All Ann Sweeten's music is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard! At any time of day you can listen to Ms. Sweeten, morning, day or night time and you can feel any stress you might have just leave your body. Then, she gently takes your mind, soul and imagination on a journey all its' own. Highly, highly recommend her music to anyone that likes piano music, easy listening or music to accompany either a morning cup of coffee or an evening glass of wine!"
3,No other choice,"I heard this on NPR and loved the violin. However, it's only available as an mp3 download. The recording suffers from mp3 compression. Some of us listen to music outside of a iTouch player and enjoy the full sound of the original recording. Can't say I am a fan of mp3 from Amazon, unless all you want is some music for computer background."
5,This Helped Me,"I used this during the first few weeks of Geometry in order to understand all of the terminology and the rules. It helped me a lot, and was a good addition to my text book."
1,NOT AS GOOD AS 2nd Edition!,"I think this updated version is not as clear and accurate as the 2nd. Though efforts can be seen trying to improve it and make it more attractive but, simply not as good as the 2nd edition."
2,Caution - There are Mistakes,"I bought this book to use with my daughter for added drill and review of Geometry and was shocked to find an inaccurate mathematical statement after the Commutative Law of Multiplication (3a X 5 = 5 X 2a = 10a) and three errors in the solutions provided to practice questions in the first eight pages. I haven't ventured further, but based on my experience thus far, I will need to review every example and problem for accuracy, something I hadn't planned to do and shouldn't need to do."
5,Excellent if you need a refresher course in geometry,"I found myself needing to review geometry for the SAT and needed a succinct, clear, and accurate guide. This outline has more than exceeded my expectations. By the time I worked through most of the problems in this book, my geometry skills had doubled and the SAT geometry was relatively easy.I highly reccomend this book as either a refresher guide or as a textbook."
2,Good review of concepts - Poor Editing!,"I am using this book as a refresher while studying for an upcoming qualification exam. In just the opening chapters covering Algebra review, I was appalled at the number of errors made. These are not typographical errors as is the case where the book says that something weighs ""11 km"", but flagrant syntactical errors that produce a muddled understanding of the underlying concepts.Luckily, I am still fresh enough with Algebra to catch these errors, however, I have to question their ability to clearly convey geometry material without confusion.This is not to say that the text is a total wash, but I do expect a certain level of accuracy from outline materials such as this."
3,"Not horrible, not great...","I got this book as review of basic geometry. Mostly because they never made a Forgotten Geometry text. It's really not bad. It covers quite a bit of ground, from simple geometry to a taste of analytical and transformational geometry.Conversely, this book didn't wow me either. It covers some basic algebra in the beginning, which is fine for the easier formulas like area and perimeter, but not nearly enough for a comprehensive study of geometry. One should study Schaum's outline of Intermediate Algebra or College Algebra, or a text of their choosing, before tackling any geometry. Especially if your preparing for a Calculus/Analytical Geometry Course.I haven't found a good intro geometry book yet(I haven't even looked!), but when I do, I'll be sure to update this review. As always, good luck!"
5,This changed my life!!,"I loved this book so much. I got it in the mail and couldn't put it down for three days straight. I learned so much about Harry Potter that I never knew existed, and now when I re-read the Harry Potter books, I'm able to pick out things that don't make sense, things that give us clues, and other tidbits that I wouldn't have been able to find without this book! I recommend any Harry Potter fan to read this. I learned so much and am thankful I got it!!!"
1,Horrible RUBBISH,"This is the worst Harry Potter ""slueths"" book ever. I would much rather read books that have to do with the legends behind the stories (ex. 'The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter') instead of this. let's get this straight...SNAPE IS NOT A VAMPIRE, and LUPIN IS NOT JAMES POTTER! this is reallllly stupid!"
3,"Clever, but flawed for children","This book is clever and thought-provoking, but I was disturbed at the apparent lack of copy editing. I believe that a book that is targeted at children, especially ""tweens"" and teens, had many English usage problems. The major problem was the use of ""it's"" for the possessive, but there also was affect/effect misuse, ""phased"" instead of ""fazed,"" and many misuses of hyphenated words (a lot of hyphenated words shouldn't have been hyphenated). These were not typographical errors.I found that the errors detracted from my enjoyment of the book. They were distracting and a poor example for a youngster. I therefore would not recommend it (unless the adult pointed out that there were grammatical errors -- would the kids care?)J.K.R.'s writing is exemplary in grammar, style, and structure. Would that the authors of this work followed her example."
2,Hardly Australian cuisine,"What an unfortunate book from authors who should know better. The book could far better be called 'In celebration of the New International Cuisine' because I can't tell the difference between what the authors claim is Australian and what is often presented in up market and hotel restaurants in Tokyo, New York, LA, London, Dubai, Mumbai or Singapore. This 'nice' food book has little to contribute to its intended audience and certainly little to do with what Australian food is becoming - unique, authentic and characterised by a wide range of indigenous ingredients.For anyone wanting to really know what Australian cuisine is all about, get the Dining Downunder Cookbook (order it through Amazon or find it online). Other related books on the topic are The Bushfood Handbook and Uniquely Australian, both by Vic Cherikoff."
1,Not the quality I would expect from Lorex,"I'm a huge fan of Lorex products. I've had two quad observation systems, a 4 channel DVR, and baby monitor. All of these products beat my expectations and ran perfect. But not this camera. It runs perfectly for 3 minutes and then scrambled lines began appearing. This behavior is repeatable using different monitors and power supplies. So I suspect it has some faulty circuits. Too bad, because Lorex is generally reliable."
5,Well Written,"I would recommend this documentary to anyone interested in history, FDR, and/or the news of the time. The film was well coordinated; the composition of the film flowed with steady interest. I showed it at our Historical Society's annual meeting, after which we heard many positive comments. Very well done, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the 1935 Depression era. It gives great insight to the tempo of America then."
5,Great for homeschooling!,I have used Vocab Works with my kids for years and they are a great tool for teaching vocabulary.
4,Great Surge Protector if you have kids...,"I bought this surge protector for two reasons, the first being the longer than standard cord, second, I have a one year old that is now mobile and very curious. It is also a nice gray color, not black or yellow like most surge protectors with longer cords. I have had no problems with the product, it serves it's purpose."
5,Neat and Compact!!!,I have a tangled mess behind my entertainment center and needed something that would disguise all my wires and this product did the trick. You have plenty of room for your cords and it also looks real nice. Another thing is if you have any indoor pets that like to mess with everything this keeps the cords where they wont be able to bother them.
3,A Bit Bulky,"This product is a bit big and cumbersome. The concealed aspect is nice, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra money as compared to a regular surge protector."
4,Covered protection,"This item was a little expensive but the protection is good, I would say great but I recently upgraded my home theater with an HDDVR and this requires two coaxle cable inputs an this item only acomadates one in and one out and if the coaxle is not connected its not warrentied."
1,Broke within 2 days!,"Ordered two, loved the idea. The hinges were tiny & they were a bit difficult to assemble. Within two days both covers were cracked & the hinges were broken, and now everything looks messy again. I'm very disappointed, but will try other brands in hopes of a better result (Ikea & Bluelounge make similar products)."
3,Good concept / cheap construction,"I like the idea, but my two year old broke the thing 2 seconds out of the box. The tiny (and I mean tiny) little plastic hinges holding the door on don't stand a chance. On top of that, the plastic hinge that's supposed to hold the door closed doesn't have any strength, and my bundle of cords kept popping it open. I bought two of them so had an extra. Needless to say I'm keeping the thing now that I have it. It's a good idea, and mostly works, but could definitely use some stronger binding pieces."
4,Hides items nicely - but with some minor oversights,"This item has done a number on the mess I had around my entertainment center; it does conceal the electrical cords (as advertised), but the tabs are a bit on the weak side. I also wish they would have made the cover a little bit deeper; I have some pressure on my plug from the TV set (Toshiba), though it does manage to close OK. My replacement plug from my original XBox also does not fit in the large capacity area due to the small area allowed to plug in the larger plugs (xbox plug is too long to fit properly), however it does plug into the 11th outlet (outside the concealed area) just fine. It did the job I wanted, but not in a lavish style. Oh, also I'm a bit bummed that it didn't included surge protection for 2 separate coaxial cables (have TIVO, uses 2 tuners, this only has 1 so I am still using the old surge protector this was supposed to replace just to ground the cables out). It is a good product, just not ""outstanding""."
3,Solid device but not as useful as you might hope.,"First, it's a great idea. I'm sick of the wall of my living room looking like a set from a bad science fiction movie. The problem is, as bulky as it is, there still isn't enough room to hide all the excess wire you might want to hide in there.So, pros: excellent idea, solid execution. Cons: bulky, and it still can't tuck away all the power wires I need to hide."
2,"Excellent idea, poor execution.","The hinge on one side broke the same day we bought and installed it. I had read other reviews who commented on the same issue and tried to be careful, but it was impossible.Getting the cables through the cable holds was a nightmare for anything that had to do with high voltage (XBox) and the space was not there to hide the cables - simply the electrical plugs.There is no way to secure the top closed, so we ended up zip-tieing the entire thing and groan when we have to pull any plugs out of it.There isn't a lot on the market right now for this type of product, so this might be the best one out there, even with it's design flaws."
1,"doesn't conceal anything, looks hideous","The surge protector works fine. BUT getting all the cords to fit where and how they're supposed to is a joke. I bought three of these after looking at the photos and descriptions. Short of stripping wires to make it fit, it doesn't fit. In 20/20 hindsight I noticed the photos didn't have plug-ins for office/electronics items ... they're all for small electric items. What I want a surge protector for is (home) office gear ... computers, printers - the stuff with the large round cords - that does NOT fit into the ""Concealer."""
5,Great product,"I am always nervous about buying a surge protector since there so many out there and I heard a lot of them failed and caused damages. I have got this one not too long ago so I can't tell how good it really is yet. So far so good though. I like the compact design that hold many plugs in a clean looking box. Also, the indication of $100,000 damage insurance made me feel somehow secured. Hope it will last for a long time and protect my stuff through the thunder storms."
4,Very Good Product,"I agree with earlier comments that the construction could be better. While, due to its design, the cover easily falls off when lifted, it is also easy to put back on. Once on, I have had not problem with the cover falling off on its own.The product has helped to reduce cord clutter. That's why it was bought, so I consider it a very effective product."
4,Large but good,"This is larger than I was expecting, but I have not seen anything better. It keeps the wires neatly out of sight so my baby is less interested. Belkin is a great company. This is a very nice product for sure."
1,such a disappointment,"This was a complete waste. I was very excited to find this, and it is a great idea. However, the actual proportions of the outlets and their placement are very inflexible. Modern plugs, especially the ones you are most likely to be plugging into a surge protector, are sided, occasionally having a third prong, often bulky (computers, phones, wireless router). It was impossible to fit these three items into the 6 outlets on the surge protector."
4,Didn't fit a few types of chargers-but good overall,"Couldn't easily fit an Apple charger or my phone charger. Both of these chargers have the fold out double plug that shifted the bulky part so that it wouldn't fit in the ""bigger"" spaces.Other than this, it was a good surge and I really like it."
2,Cheap,"The tiny plastic hinges on mine were broken straight out of the box. I ended up using tape to keep the door shut, and stuck it behind a cabinet.The only thing I like about it is that you can plug four wall transformers into it without covering up adjecent plugs."
2,Belkin mini conceales surge protector,"This item is much larger than I expected and so far I have been unable to conceal all my wiring within it. I would probably send it back, but I just can't get it together. I plan to work with it a little more. One good thing is that it seems pretty sturdy."
2,"Floating yes, lighting not so great!",These lights are not waterproof so they really are not much good. I was disappointed that you can't even use them as pictured.
2,no,the time does not set correctly temp seems to be accurate but time is way of tried multiple times to reset
1,WHAT?! I paid for a NEW item,"I received NO box, NO instructions (so what, right?), and NO WIRELESS SENSOR!!! I got a beeping clock with batteries already installed (thus the beeping... I wasn't self-editing blue language) wrapped in bubble wrap. Period. Nothing else. SHAMEFUL!"
5,Spectacular!!,"The musis is a nice change of pace from what is currently available on the market. I found it easy to listen to, it worked for me when cleaning the house and even from the office. I think S-Love is my favorite, it is hauntingly melodic. This is music that tells a story! I hope these guys are working on a second album!"
2,not what I expected,"I had high hopes for this, an audio CD of these great stories, but the author read them and unfortunately, he sounded very old and with his thick accent it was simply not fun to listen to these stories and we chalked it up to a bum purchase. so I'm sad to say I can't recommend this particular collection and hope that someone with an easier to understand accent and voice and more of an acting background, takes another crack at this."
5,Really Great!,Roald Dahl reading his own stories? Awesome! We keep this in the car and the kids (and my husband and I) love to listen.
4,Good around the house,Good for personal needs. Use it to connect my laptop to my lcd hdtv. Works great. Only issue - its thick & heavy!
1,no delivery,i ordered this item from a month ago never got it people dont buy anything from them its a rip off amazon please cancell these people from ur site
4,Excellent cable for a fair value,Excellent product at a pretty low value when compared to those obnoxious vales chaged by Monster cable. The reason why I gave 1 star less is because of the audio jack length. its really small ..in laptops/pc's where the vga input and the headphone input are wide-apart ...u will struggle-A
5,Cables worked to allow pc to tv,These worked great for me to watch a movie through my laptop and on my HDTV. There are many places to get free cable tv and these allowed me to watch in the comfort of my living room with a largerer screen.
5,Love Malvina!,"We discovered ""Tiny Boxes"" while watching Weeds and now we love Malvina. I wish I had known about her earlier."
4,Great toy for a great price!,Wonderful starter train for a young child - the train is easy to assemble & use and enables a lot of imagination. The dvd is fun as well & you can't beat this price. Plus to be able to add on other sets is a great asset!
1,not worth the money,"My wife has an ebay business and bought this for insights. This is cmoon sense, and there are enough free guides available that provide the same information.We returned the book promptly."
1,Awful,"I am a Jarre fan, went to see the Docklands concert , Wembley and Manchester. This is quite simply the most awful live album I have ever heard. If you listen carefully you can hear the same audience samples being used time and time again every time a piece finishes.If you are a first time Jarre buyer try Equinoxe or Oxygene (original and the follow up are good)This one is NOT very inspiring and please avoid at all costs."
2,Weakest Jarre live album,"This is the worst album from Jean Michel Jarre. A rushed job live album appallingly edited and mixed it takes too many tracks and cuts them in half. Most notably Industrial Revolution is around 5 minutes instead of the 15 on the studio album.The synth sounds used are 'too digital' and thin, there's no decent acoustic instruments to warm it up although Hank Marvin does provide good accompaniment on Rendez vous 4 and London Kid.China and Houston/Lyon are much better as live albums."
1,THIS STUFF REALLY SUCKS,"I HAD THE PLEASURE OF GOING TO SCHOOL WITH THE DRUMMER OF THIS BAND, DAVID PARKER,WHO WAS A REAL JACKASS.HE ALWAYS WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO BE DIFFERENT IN A TRENDY BOHEMIAN WIERD ASS WAY.HIS DRUMMING IS NOT TASTEFUL AT ALL IT IS WAY TOO TECHNICAL AND OVERDONE.THE SINGING ON THIS ALBUM SUCKS TOO.OVERALL THIS ALBUM SUCKS MORE THAN WORDS CAN EXPLAIN DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY A BIG SANDY AND THE FLY RITE BOYS CD IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME GOOD SWING ROCKABILLY MUSIC,HECK BUY A LITTLE JIMMY DICKENS BEST OF ALBUM IT WILL KICK THIS ALBUMS ASS!!!!!!!!!"
4,One of the most origin bands in years....,"This band takes a classic sound and puts a modern spin on things. With a live show to die for, this is one of the most origin bands in years. Their live show is explosive and this album which was recorded live captures that good time feeling. Also, their style reaches all ages from teenagers to older adults...."
1,Dull and unexciting,"I got this cd expecting it to be great, but it just turned out really uninspiring. Stay away."
4,George Sanders Replaces Louis Hayward,"THE SAINT IN NEW YORK was the first Saint movie produced by RKO Radio Pictures and it starred Louis Hayward as Simon Templar ( ""The Saint""). In this episode Templar was hired to eliminate some criminals. The supporting cast included Kay Sutton and Jack Carson.The next entry in the series was THE SAINT STRIKES BACK which appeared in 1939. It was based on the novel ANGEL OF DOOM by Leslie Charteris who had sold the rights to several of his books featuring the Saint to RKO Radio Pictures. George Sanders was given the role of Templar. The supporting cast included Wendy Barrie and Barry Fitzgerald."
5,Superb,"Aidan Nichols presents an outstanding work on the historical development and theology of the sacrament of Holy Orders. His work is very comprehensive, yet readable and enjoyable. His background on the topic seems to be extensive and there is a brief commentary at the end on women's ordination and another on celibacy. Nichols is a scholar and any priest or seminarian would be impressed with this work. I would say that this book should be used in any course dealing with ministry and/or the sacrament of Holy Orders in the Church."
1,the isaacs cd,the cd sticks and drags some. this was a waste of money for me and i dont have the time to mess with returning it. it was supposed to be in good condition but i dont think this is considered good condition. guess ive learned my lesson. should have boughten a new one. guess u get what you pay for.
4,Reallly like this group,"I must like this group better than I thought as I inadvertedly ordered this CD twice. I do really like their music, love them on the Gaither's and listen to this album both at home and in the car."
2,Not a five star album,"This album is okay, but I only liked a few of the songs. Ms. Isaacs has a nice voice. I first saw the Isaacs on the Bill Gaither show several years ago."
2,"Not an ""idiot's"" guide...","This is an ""in-depth learning the Italian language"" book. Lots of grammer, conjugating etc. It has it's merit but it is not an easy book to use. I needed a book that shows how to get through a 2 week vacation in Italy...how to pronounce common phrases. If that is what you need.....This NOT that book!!!"
1,"Good concept, but that's it.","The one good thing about this movie ""the Judas Project"" is strictly the concept. It is perhaps the worst piece of cinematography I have ever seen. Everything is pitiful--from the acting to the costumes. Even the sound quality was lacking! The script was RATHER pathetic. The music was insultingly cheesy, and the acting was...well...embarassing to say the least. The historical significance of such an event happening at a later time was completely disregarded. I was embarassed to have found myself watching this movie and was overwhelmed at the pitiful quality with which it had been put together. I cannot argue that the intentions of those who made this movie were pure and sincere, but the intent does not make up for the quality. I had wonderful hopes for this movie, but was completely dissappointed. It's too bad that there isn't a ""0 stars"" rating. This movie was utterly and completely a failure."
1,An Unanswered Question,"The movie is based on one question: ""What if the saga of Jesus happened today?"". The problem is, the question is never answered. What this film is, is simply a modern day re-telling of the saga of Jesus. It is too literal an interpretation. The 12 desciples are still all men. They are all named the same as the original 12. ""Jesse"" (why not Joshua???), as the savior is called, feeds the hungry with bread instead of something modern like pizza. Jesse is executed on the cross instead of by lethal injection or some other modern method.Although most of the story was a bit judgmental and anti-semitic in some aspects, the special effects were good and the crusifixion scene was intense and very dramatic."
5,"John Cheever, Edith Wharton, and now Ward Just","I discovered Ward Just with his novel, ""Forgetfulness"" and began to think that he has a rare talent for capturing the spirits of Americans abroad. Reading ""Ambition and Love"" about Americans in Paris has confirmed that view. I now think too that he lays open the lives of WASPs and WASPish America, at home and not, with an anthropologist's eye, one who studies and writes about his tribe with a distance, affection and insight that would be the envy of someone like Margaret Mead."
4,Good-looking watch for a great price,"You cannot beat the price on this basic, easy-to-read watch. My only complaint is that the date function does not work on the one I received, but I can live without it. I am a female, but I bought the men's watch because I like the look of the larger face. The indiglo feature is nice, too."
5,Wraps around me well,"I love the band. It fits perfectly, and was just as advertised. I recommend it to anyone now and forever."
3,Timex Troubles,"The Timex watch I am tring to use has had problems. The strap is much longer than that of the Timex Men's leather watch strap it replaces. Also the strap is very stiff. It works, however - or rather did work, until the back of the case fell off (my fault) and I cannot get it to fit back in. The man at the drugstore that used to sell TIMEX WATCHES says replacing the back requires a tool. Where do I find a dealer who can re-install the backing. The battery itself is fine."
2,Description no help,There was nothing wrong with this product. I don't wear gold. The product description should include the color of the case. My monitor made it look silver. It doesn't even indicate if it's a men's or women's watch. I returned the item promptly. It's a men's watch by the way although the size would have been fine with me.
4,"Good watch, looks good, works great.","First of all this watch is the T2N3699J, not the T2H291. Second, the case diameter is 35mm not 30mm.Now that we got that all cleared up, I recommend the watch. It does it's job and looks classic. I think this watch has actually started to get me interested in more expensive watches too."
2,"Lacked Depth, Poorly Written","Good idea, terrible execution. The characters weren't believable, and I didn't actually care about any of them. I think this could have been good, it just wasn't. I only read this book because it was the only book I brought on vacation."
1,"How do you say ""LISTEN AND REPEAT"" in Spanish...?","The folks at Berlitz must be getting desperate. Another listen-and-repeat songbook? One hour with ANY OTHER WORKBOOK will teach you the Spanish you need to ""get by"". If you're a more serious student, just buy a more serious product. The bottom line is: this product just doesn't work and it's not in the least charming. The reviewers who give five stars are Berlitz employees and most of the reviews you're reading are sales pitches.NOTE A DESTINATION DES PROFS: Ces livres sont du gaspillage total. Il faut les eviter ? tout prix ? risque de decevoir vos ?tudiants."
2,Needs clearer definition of what the item is!,"I was very surprised and disapointed to find out this was SOAP! Now looking at the item again I see that it only says ""soaprocks"" in tiny print of the name of the seller. While it's pretty, and smells nice, I wanted this for a gift for my son who collects rocks. Now I'll have to start over."
3,Light and airy. The personal journal is useful.,"I've been most frustrated with not being able to identify the background music for this CD. There is no credit given for the wonderful, soothing background music. If I were the author of such a piece I would be all over Random House for the oversight of credit due."
5,love it,"Great product,affordable, good quality. Looking forward to making another purchase. Arrived in good condition.Love the way it looks on me"
4,Shattered Silence,I saw this movie for the first time the other nite-it sure kept me in suspense. My eyes were glued to the tv till the end. I thought it was a very good movie and have even watched it couple times since.
3,Chilling!,"This movie gave me the creeps when I first saw it as a child (under the title ""When Michael Calls""), and still manages to make me shudder! The phone calls from Michael, presumed dead, really make the hair stand up on your neck - just the voice is enough to make you want to hang up and take the phone off the hook! Lots of suspence and atmosphere - the Halloween carnival scene is horrifying! A great thriller!"
4,A Very Enjoyable Thriller,"I can remember being about 13 years old and my sister and I watching this on t.v. (the ABC ""Movie of the Week!"") and how wonderfully scared we were! I think we watched it every time it came on. I thought it was kind of unbelievable, but if you just watch it without taking it too seriously you will enjoy it. I think this film has a real kind of ""campy"" following. One of the best t.v. thrillers, that's for sure!"
1,tom forsyth,"I agree with the info in the first review. In addition, the dvds are said to be in color. FALSE. Also the supposed never before seen bonus outtakes were all on the Pioneer discs years ago. The pictures used are kinda dumb too, from all over Judy's career.You only get what you pay for."
3,Optics,This schaum's outline is too old for this topic (same thing for Optics by Eugene Hecht ISBN: 0805385665). It is time for someone to write a new one even if physics has not changed! (I guess what you pay is what you get!)Pro: good summary for something you knowcon: not much detail like many old books from schaum's
3,A Family for Douglas,"I purchased this horse as an companion for a little boy who is three years old. I had purchased another horse in this line for him when he was born and he keeps it with him all the time. He became concerned about the fact that His original horse(named Douglas) did not have a family for him to play with and he was very lonely, so now along comes Hero as a brother for Douglas. There is nothing else that I needed to know before I bought Hero, everything was very well expained in the advertisement. And most importantly a little boy will be happy."
3,Over-priced...,"I own this pan and indeed this is a good pan. Actually Calphalon One series is a great pans to own. These pans are especially good for browning, for their excellent heat distribution and the superior non-stick surface. However you do not buy the browning for 4 qt. pan. The surface contour is not flat for good browning purpose either.This is pan is currently listed as $184.95 and it is ""over-priced"".I bought this pan less than half the price at a local store. For even that price, I thought it was bit over-priced.It is a great pan but it is not worth near $200 you pay for. It has a decent non-stick surface and but is like another 4qt. pan you use for stew or to make sauces."
2,Run of the mill,"Placido Domingo, Adriana Maliponte, Jose Van Dam and Georges Pretre all recorded this opera commercially - two of them several times - so the interest in this recording lies with Fiorenza Cossotto. Her interpretation is quite standard; she ignites no sparks and brings no new insights to the part. Her voice is a little brighter than many people may be used to in their gypsy seductress but there is nothing really to complain about.The sound is standard for a live recording of the 1970s. It improves with repeated listenings. The version uses the traditional Guiraud recitatives instead of spoken dialog.All in all, unless you're a diehard Cossotto fan, there is little reason to purchase this. Go for one of the inexpensive commerical recordings."
1,A technically poor-quality recording of Carmen,"Technically, this is a very poor quality recording. It sounds as if this live performance had been recorded by a portable tape recorder held by someone in the audience. Even at a bargain price, skip this Carmen."
1,garbage,"I used this pump twice not even one hour for the total time and won't work anymore,don't waste your money on this pump."
3,Great Pump,"I use this pump to do water changes. It's tiny but it's low wattage and it definitely beats scooping out containers of water. Works best with down flow, output is decreased with elevated up flow. I like it, it's convenient. Two thumbs up from me."
2,Pretty bad,"This book is absolutely not recommended for self-instruction. Without answers, how can one know if you're doing the problems right? If there is a solution manual, it should come with the book."
1,Best used for target practice,"This book has lots of practice problems to solve. But no answers to any of them. There are very few examples for the student to work through and the concepts are introduced very poorly. I found the reading confusing and tedious with little explanation. Instead, it jumps, almost imediately, into equations without explaining what the section is about. Many hours of my time was wasted that didn't need to be due to this book and it probably cost me two letter grades. I haven't decided whether I will sell this book or just take it to a field and shoot it.TO ALL INSTRUCTORS: DO NOT USE THIS BOOK!!!!!"
5,Perfect all-year round jacket,"I have bought several of this same jacket now for almost 8 years. It looks nice, it is lightweight, and is adequate for all but the most extreme cold. I live in New England and this is the only jacket I own. Perfect for fall and spring, and most of the winter. On very cold days I may wear a sweater underneath.Can't be beat."
3,Does the job but,"This scale is nice looking and seems accurate enough... however, it burns through batteries like you wouldn't believe. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Great gift for a dog lover,I purchased this as a gift for someone who loves dogs but cannot own one. It is the cutest thing!
2,Don't buy!,"I had a very disappointed 4 yr old Xmas morning. This dog does not look like a dachshund nor is it 12 inches from paw to paw! 8 inches max! When she opened it her comment was ""I wanted a long dachshund"". Will not be ordering Xmas presents anymore from Amazon or anywhere else! Sorry!"
5,Adorable Douglas,"I bought this stuffed animal for my nephew since he did well in school. It just so happens that he has a real dachshund, who looks just like Douglas named ""Duggie"". So the stuffed animal couldn't be more appropriate. He loves it and says he looks just like the real dog."
5,An Overlooked Masterpiece,"The following is a true story.Mosquito changed my life for the better. When I first saw Mosquito I was in a pretty dark period in my life. But what the (deep, remarkable) characters on the screen were going through made my problems look like a day at the fair!Imagine Mosquitos flipping your mobile home over. Or having to crawl into a filthy sewage pipe for precious seconds of survival.By the time the credits rolled I had a new perception of my life situation. I'm now attending grad school and have met the girl of my dreams. Thank you Mosquito!"
1,This movie made me very scary!!!,"If you enjoy watching good horror films you will love this awesome thriller. Golly, I dont recall being so horrified during a movie; that's because the special effects are so incredible that you will never think of mosquitos the same. Edge of your seat thriller, hell no!!! EDGE OF YOUR LIFE. Not for toddlers, this movie is for true horror film lovers. I mean the story, the actors everything in this movie rocks, and prepare yourself for the balls n'Aaz sentimental ending. So buy or rent this because this movie is ""DAMN STRAIGHT"""
2,nilou,not much diffrence ....i just see a lot of baby fine hairgrowing in around my scalp...i used it for one year and i dont think i will purchase it again
1,Disappointed,Disappointed. Information was incredibly general -- topics covered in this book provided less information than content covered in SAP's general introduction courses.
1,One of the Worst,Probably the most useless instructional manual i have ever seen. The book consists of little beyond the most general topics.. Whats the procedure around here for getting one's money back?
2,This is the only Intro book available to SAP R/3,"This is the only intro book available on SAP R/3. The book is on the way of getting outdated. The screen shots in the book and Real life screen shots (SAP 4.6 C or D) differ a lot. From this book, one does not learn much except navigation of SAP's various modules. It also gives some basic ideas abt using SAP system. This book is aimed at the end user and not for wannabe SAP Consultant."
3,A piece of the puzzle.....,"While I appreciate what Larocca was trying to accomplish, the book has a number of shortcomings. It's dated, and therefore focused on what's becoming only a small piece of the SAP software story. And it's audience seems to vary from chapter to chapter. Of the 10+ books I have dealing with SAP, I put this one in the middle of the pack - I was compelled to finally pick up a copy (used, please!) given that it continues to top the best sellers. But I must say that if you really want to learn SAP from a technical, implementation, or administration perspective, you need to keep looking. I'll rarely flip through the pages of Teach Yourself again, but know from the dog-eared pages in my books by Jacobs/Whybark and G Anderson that really good books - ones that probably have a better claim to teaching you anything in 24 hours - exist."
2,"VERY, VERY BASIC","This is a good book for a very basic overview of SAP. If you want more detail, get something else."
3,"Good book, but not for everyone","First of all nobody can learn SAP in 24 hours and this book will not do it. This book definitely give you very general and very basic overview of SAP functionality. In my opinion this book is for people like system annalists, technical annalists, IT specialists etc. with no SAP knowledge who would like to start working with SAP. It is however not for ordinary SAP user - subjects (hours) are mostly technical and language is also technical."
3,"Good, but not expected","SAP R/3 in 24 Hours was a good intro book for familiarizing oneself with the general working of the vast program. My only gripe was with the level of detail being less than I expected in the modules. ""How do I enter a sales order, journal entry, standard costs...?"" These questions were not the kind that were answered easily in this basic text.So, in summary, it will help you with general tasks like logging in, changing your password, the architecture behind the program (broadly), and navigation. It is not the book to tell you how to do your job inside a company using SAP."
3,Saturday Night track is not the original recording,"I purchased this cd for only one track: Saturday NightMuch to my dismay, the track contained in this re-pressing is not the original from back in the 80s.I'm now stuck with a lame cd I don't want.Just a message of buyer beware.Thanks."
1,This Album Blows,"I loved their first album, Dying In Stereo, but there's no way around it, this album is terrible."
1,The universe must have its reasons...,"I admit I don't have this album, but I did see Northern State open for Cake at their New York appearance this weekend. I am still, three days later, reeling at what I saw.Can ANYONE honestly take this junk seriously?I am reminded of three other singing females of my past who had no talent and were simply riding the coat-tails of their male counterparts... the Chipettes - remember them? It was weird enough that America became obsessed with three singing chipmunks... then the girly counterparts showed up. Why, you ask? My only guess is that the universe felt the need to balance itself somehow, and forced us to suffer in the process.And these Beastie Boys wannabes are, I think, another product of the universe-righting mechanism. The Beasties are the real deal, these girls are poor imitations from an affluent Long Island suburb.Please don't encourage them. One trio of whiny females was enough."
1,Shoot me if I ever have to listen to this cow flop again,"One of the worst collections of pseudo-rap ever, which in this case is a bunch of whiny, mostly overweight and beauty challenged Beastie Girls wannabees. ""Goes Gone Vile"" would be a better title of this CD. Don't waste your money. It's even overpriced in the Amazon Marketplace at .01"
3,Picture not 100% accurate,"The colors are more see-through and blended than in the picture, and the green stripe is yellow, not green at all."
5,everyday watch,"My husband wanted a watch that he could wear when he wasn't wearing his ""good"" watch. This was the perfect choice...it's nice looking and has the large numbers, date and lighted face that he wanted.For the price...it can't be beat, and Martha Stewart recommended it!"
2,Timex Quality Slipping,"I never intended to use the band that came with this watch, so I won't comment on that. The watch istelf was set to a date about 15 days away from actual, so I had to wind it for a long time to reach the right date. In the process, the winding stem came out. I was able to screw it back in. On an older Timex that would never happen. Timex used to be the go-to cheapie that still had reasonable quality; great for people like me who are a bit hard on watches. Somehow, I don't think this one will be around very long."
2,Nice but too small,"It is a nice watch but too small in reality, the photo of it is very misleading, so I get frustrated when I received it. As well as there is a little loud on the second hand ticking!"
2,WARNING - loud second hand ticking could cause insanity,"Firstly, let me say that this watch is great in many different ways; It looks great, keeps time well, and is priced fairly low. However it has one flaw that can not be overlooked and has caused me to stop wearing it. As mentioned in a previous review, the second hand is REALLY LOUD. It can be heard all the time, depending on the angle of the watch to your ear, and if you are in a quiet room, it is all you will hear. Maybe others are able to deal with this, but it is a deal breaker for me."
4,everyday watch,"I like it as a casual watch, clear face, easy to read, indeglo is great at night and I like the leather band instead of an expansion band. good all around watch"
5,Love it!,"This watch is awesome. Though it is one of the 3 watches that I own, I normally use this one. It has become my favorite."
5,Timex T2H281,This watch is simple and easy to read. I love the date feature and indiglo. For a simple watch this will work fine.
2,"Nice watch, too girly","This is a great watch, a little loud on the second hand ticking, but other than that it looks awesome. The leather band is too skinny making it look a lot like a women's watch. I wouldn't buy it if I saw it in a store."
2,"So so item, misleading list price","The actual watch doesn't look as good as it appears on the picture. The watch band feels really cheap. Even worse, the $39.95 list price of this watch is misleading - the same watch has a list price of $24.99 at any target local stores at any time, before any discounts. If you really want to get this watch, please get it from a local target store, it's cheaper there and it will be easier for you to return it in case you don't like it."
2,Not Worth the Money,"The face of this watch is nice... and that's about it. Shipped with a dead battery. After some arguing with Amazon, I managed to get them to credit my account for the cost of a replacement battery and I bought one. However, as soon as I popped the rear cover off to replace the battery, the internal components scattered about. I never was able to get the back cover to stay on and all the components to go in, and I eventually threw this watch away."
2,INDIGLO DOESN'T GLOW,There are two reasons I bought this watch. Mainly because it was my dad's watch and when he passed away mom gave it to me and I loved it for sentimental reasons. I discovered that it was really cool because I could press the crown and know the time even in the middle of the night or in a dark theater or concert.When the chrome plating next to my skin started flaking away I decided it was time for a new Timex INDIGLO and I ordered the same watch on Amazon. I received it within 3 days. Wow! what service. Unfortunately when I press the crown - NADA! The glo does not work so I'm a bit bummed out. When I emailed Timex they said I should contact the vendor. I really don't want to mess with it so I remain bummed out.
1,I may have defect one...,"Less than a month, the watch started slowing down dozens of seconds a day..Kinda odd. I trust Timex, but not this case."
1,timex men watch,"bad bad buy i not recommend this watch is petit little, so expensive a lot of taxes en fin no me gusto no lo recomiendo no lo compren fue una mala experiencia"
2,Good Watch...Bad Band,As with all Seiko Watches this one keeps great time but it's very hard to put on your wrist. The little prongy thing that goes through the holes in the band keeps going of the left or right and that makes it hard to clasp. In fact I just gave it away to Goodwill because I was tired fighting with it. If you buy it you may wish to think about replacing the band with something better. That being said it's a bargain for the price.
1,"just barely 1 month and the band broke , trying to find out how to contact seller this seems to be thje only way",trying to find out how to contact seller this seems to be the only way .If i don't here from your company will write full report on this page. This seller hasn't even tried to contact me about the product i brouight very bad compnay will never do business with this company.Thjey haven't even tried to contact me STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY NOTHIG GOOD COMES FROM THEM
3,"Good Watch, Bad Wristband","Pros:Easy to ReadGreat Price vs ValueLooks GoodIndiglo Feature is Bright!Cons:Wrist Band is Uncomfortable""Loud"" Second Hand"
5,Great watch Great price,"Timex has always been a reliable brand for my consumer-wise shopping. The watch is simple, classic, and reliable. It served as the perfect gift for my husband."
5,"Classy, cheap and good.","The watch came in a nice box that wasn't too fancy and quite the right size for my preference. I had this shipped to Singapore where I live so how it's shipped is very important to me. The watch looks great and works well thus far, and seems like it will last for quite some time."
4,overall satisfied except some minor drawbacks,"I bought the watch two weeks ago.The watch is basically what it is advertised. Neat, light and clear.As commented by some earlier buyers, the second hand is quite loud, and you can hear it in office.And the strap is a bit flimsy.Overall, I am satisfied."
3,the band blows,"It's a nice watch, but the band is cheap. I'd be willing to pay $10 more if it came with a better band."
5,Great watch,"This watch is exactly what I was looking for. I'm using it as a ""sports"" watch, golf. Very easy to read. Do to the impact of the club hitting the ground on most strokes I needed a watch that would ""take a licking and keep on ticking"". And Timex fits that requirement.Also, I live in a very hot and humid area of the country and needed a watch that would stand up to the perspiration. This watch does everything I need AND the cost is very reasonable."
4,"Good for the price, semi-loud ticking","This watch is good for what it is, a $25 watch. It functions as it should, has a date box, and looks pretty good for a cheap watch. You can dress it up or down. That being said, it does have drawbacks. The strap is a bit cheap and flimsy (but hey, it's a cheap watch, so you get what you pay for). Additionally, the ticking is quite loud for a wrist watch. You do, however, have to have the watch within, say, 3 feet of your ear to hear it (or if it is on an amplifying surface like a bedside table. In this case, put it face down on a book or something similar and the sound will be greatly reduced), so unless you like to rest your head on your watch hand, you won't turn into Captain Hook.Summary:Pros: Cheap; Date Box; VersatileCons: Flimsy band; Loud ticking (but only within 3 feet of ear)"
5,Needed a dressy watch,"I went to a dinner a few months ago and had a problem. I was wearing a suit, so my standard beat-up sports watch didn't really match and so stayed home. And then I didn't want to check my phone during this very long speech, and caught myself looking at my empty wrist about 30 times. So I decided to get a watch I could wear with a suit, and this is what I got. That being said, I don't wear it all that often, but when I do it does it's job perfectly. It tells me the time, date when I need it, and slips under a jacket sleeve easily. The tick is kinda loud, but I study with music and at night I throw it in a drawer and so I never even notice it anymore. The indiglo light comes on sometimes when I don't mean it to (when I bend my wrist too much), but other than that I have no complaints."
3,Handy,Nice gift to any person who enjoys simple things. Has a night featured and just neat for any wrist. Handy!
3,Waco not drop me,Ok but the back fell off the first time I dropped it!Will have to make sure I do not drop it too often
1,will not keep time,This watch lost 1 to 2 min per day at first now 8 mon later it looses time a half hour at atime sometimes.I like the watch but appearently no warranty
5,yep,"cheap, reliable, classybest purchase i've made in a very long time. planning to buy another when this one craps out. band is functional, but will probably replace it. indiglo doesn't light entire watch-face; works for top 4/5ths - happy regardless."
4,Strap is for midgets,"I love this watch -- it replaces the same model that has lasted many years, it is clear and easy to read, has a simple design and styling and the backlight is perfect.My one grouch is that they've shrunk the band. I'm not a big guy, and this watch won't even fit around my right wrist, and it is on the last hole on the left wrist, and even then it is too tight. Leather bands don't last very long anyway, so in 6-9 months it will not be an issue, but please, please this seems to be expense shaving (literally) going too far."
4,Nice watch,"This is a nice basic watch, which is exactly what I needed. I wish it had the day as well as the date, but otherwise I am very happy with it."
2,Could wake the dead,"The Good: Watch is attractive, and Indiglo works well.The Bad: The ticking sound is so loud it could wake the dead. It's easily heard above the normal background din of an office, and even more so in a quiet environment. Too loud for normal day to day use. I will be returning the watch."
3,Ok for a cheap watch.,"I needed an easy to read, semi formal watch that I would not mind if I lost or broke it. This one fits the bill well. The only thing I do not like about it is that the band is very thin."
1,The watch does run.,I bought this as a gift for my hubby. It stops. He resets it. It stops. Very frustrated because all the packaging was thrown away after Christmas. What to do?
4,watch,"I really like this product, it is a good size, easy to read. The only problem is that it ticks really loud so sometimes I can hear it even when iI take it off to go to sleep, which is annoying. But other then that it is a great watch!!!!"
5,excellent watch for the money,I purchased this watch for my 12 yr old son for Christmas. I chose it because he is visually impaired and this watch is easy to read. It is a good quality basic watch and it can be worn for casual wear as well as a more formal look. He loves it and has no difficulty using it.
5,very nice,"light weight, low noise, easy to use!i bought it to replace my old big watch which is also form TIMEX."
4,Classic styling at a great price,"This watch is priced perfectly to make it an easy purchase for someone new to wearing watches. I needed a new watch to use for under long sleeved shirts, and this works perfectly because of the slimmer face.The ONLY issue I have with this watch is that the ""tick""ing is rather loud."
4,Good For the Money,"I think this is a nice watch for the money. Its a little smaller than I thought it would be but not a deal breaker. I work in retail so I've broken a few watches on the corners of shelves or lifting things so I now know better than to wear anything too nice to work and this fits the bill. It's replacing a timex expedition watch that is still working but the band it torn, and a new band was half the price of the watch. As others have indicated it does tick loudly but I don't sleep with it so a non-issue for me."
3,Not Bad,The watch is nice i dont mind it but its a lil smaller than what i expected but i still wear it regardless cause it looks nice with what i wear
4,Fantastic watch with only one fault,"My only issue with this watch is how loud this ticking is. If your in a room that is completely silent you could hear the watch from across the room. Whenever I'm reading I have to take the watch off to put under a pillow or in a drawer or else it will drives me crazy. Other than the noise, the watch comes with no other surprises. If you like the style of the watch you probably woulddn't find a better watch for the price point."
5,Very nice!,"For the price, very nice watch. Good buy if you are looking for a decent watch with basic functions. Very bright back light."
1,Hardly takes a licking,"I remember when Timex watches were tough. I dropped this one on the floor about a week after I got it and the back came off. Jeweler put it back together; problem then was it was always on ""indiglo,"" i.e., illumnated. Then a day or two later it stopped running altogether. Cheap junk."
3,Functional watch,"This watch is easy to read and features the date which is nice. The band however started to stink after about six weeks and was very bothersome. The date will only let you wind it forward, so if you miss a date you have roll through 30 more days worth of minutes to get to the date again. I recently received a more expensive watch as a gift. If I were to purchase another watch, I would shell out the money for a real leather band for sure."
4,"Great value, but you get what you pay for","At $25, this is a great piece. However, the leather band is starting to fray 6 weeks into it. I work a desk job, so it's not due to my lifestyle, but you get what you paid for, and I paid for low quality leather. I will probably swap out the band for higher quality one and stick with the actual timepiece until it breaks and be happy with my purchase, but I am going to leave at least 4 stars in my review."
3,It is okay for its price,I expected a more beautiful watch and I was surprise when opened the box. I said for the price it is okay and I wear it to work only
4,Good value for money,"Overall, it meets my expectations. Works well, simple enough (it is a watch) though there are some issues that I can live with:- Thickness was a bit of surprise. Seems that Timex has stuck to the early 1990s design though for the price it is hard to fault them. Guess there is a factory somewhere with paid off machinery churning these out.- Noise of the second hand movement. At first a bit quaint though after a while it starts to wear especially in a quite environment. For most people, this may not be an issue, but it does get a bit tiring when trying to concentrate or perhaps sleep."
4,Functional,High visibility....stark....just what I'd been looking for. Only negative is one must crank the hands around as many 12 hour cycles as it takes to get to the correct date....but you only have to do that once....or just a bit when months cycle between 30/31 days.
5,"nice watch, great price","Clean, simple design, easy to read, leather band - for 20 bucks and change. Such a deal! Indiglo makes nighttime reading easy (you must push the button very firmly (at first I didn't think it worked) to turn on the light, but that's not a negative). ""Silver-Tone"" means ""Bright Silver,"" at least mine is. Love this watch. Seinfeld would never throw this one away!"
5,Timex Men's T2H281,I bought this Timex Men's T2H281Night light is very bright and makes it easy to see the time when it is darkClock wonderful 5 stars ^ _ ^Love this watch.
5,Love it!,Perfect size. Looks great. Feels great. Very happy with my purchase. You should get it. You wont be disappointed. Do it!
5,Reliablity,"I purchased an earlier version (the only difference is a numeral 3 on dial face) of this Timex watch over 10 years ago. Except for rare changes of batteries, it performed brilliantly in: frigid Ohio winters and hot, humid monsoons in India; and, in the context of air conditioned offices/classrooms and the hot, VERY dusty situations of archaeological excavations. I anticipate that this replacement will deliver a similar performance."
4,Great Glass,Excellent glass for lattes. The rubber grip keep your hands cool to the touch from the hot glass. Great design!
3,Confusion of versions,"Thank goodness one more Boris without the Korsakow's ""corrections"". It's said that this performance is based on the first version.Not a complete true. The firtst act is really according with the first version, but the confusion begins in act two. The two monologues are in the second version . So, as in the met, we have one mixing of the two versions. The last act has the revolution scene , of the second version, mutilated with a stupid cut. Maestro Nosedda conducts always in a very fast way, always inexpressive. Good things: the singers are very good, and the ideas of the scene director are very interesting. One thing: I never heard a Simpleton so good.The option remains the DVD of Gergiev."
4,Excellent production,"The BluRay disc looks great, and it is a treat to see a production of the 1869 version of Boris. It is well conceived, and held my interest throughout."
3,"Close, but no cigar !","This was a gift for my 83 Y.O. mother diagnosed with macular degeneration. The item was sent to her directly, so I didn't have the opportunity to try it out first. My mother has a habit of pointing out anything that isn't 100% perfect, so here's what she told me: ""Didn't they have a rectangular model? I have to look exactly in the middle of this one to see anything. A rectangular glass would be easier for me"" This replaced a non-lighted cheapo magnifying glass,and I thought it would be more to her liking. Perhaps the more she uses it, the more she will appreciate it. In the meantime, I'll be looking for an LED rectangular unit hoping not to be spending as much. Sign me,""tried to do my homework, but didn't get a passing grade"". WR"
5,Sexy and intelligent,"Slinky, sexy and seductive vocals, playful arrangements and intelligent writing make this a great debut. Its DEFINITELY a hidden treasure that shouldn't have been hidden.You can hear subtle influences but they don't hammer you like some soul revivalistas.If you like the Staple Singers, Freda Payne, or Rose Royce from back in the day, you should give this young lady a listen. If you like newer soul divas like fantasia or Mary J this would be a worthy addition to your collection as well.Roni is the real deal."
5,Dr Peters is the BEST!,"I've had type 1 diabetes for over 20 years, been to countless doctors all over the country and finally discovered Dr Peters and her team several years ago. She's changed my life. If you have diabetes and are ready for her help, she is the best!"
2,fun does not last long,this toy was very fun to use but the planes stopped flying (nose dived) after only 2 days of fun. The top wings broke on both flyers by day 3.
5,encouragement in devotionals,This is a FAVORITE book of mine that I buy for others who are going through really hard times in their lives. It is easy to pick this book up and read it and see how God has worked through the lives of others walking through difficulties with the background stories on many wonderful old hymns. The hymns themselves are such words of encouragement and comfort. I'd recommend it for anyone regardless of where he/she happens to be in his/her spiritual walk with the Lord Jesus.
1,Don't waste your time or money...,"A very short, out-of-date and overpriced book that offers little information. It lists a number of sites and screenshots and that's about it. Very oriented to a British audience."
3,Challenging for Beginners,"I love, love, love the Allende story, but generally found the stories selected for this book dark and depressing. No matter, I'm sure that many won't agree with me. I just want to note that the vocabulary and sentence structure can be pretty challenging (I'm about intermediate), so this might not be suitable for beginners, but might be just what someone who is more advanced is looking for."
1,Kindle edition is terrible,"There's probably no way to succesfully format this type of book for the Kindle (perhaps on the DX), and Amazon should have the sense to not publish one."
5,Lovin' it so far!,I wanted a book to help me to learn spanish. I'm about 1/3 through it and its great! Stories are quick reads with very real and complex translations. It's a book in parallel text as promised. It is serving it's purpose. Get it!
1,Book print was too small,"Recommend the publisher indicate somewhere up front that the print in the book is extremely small. Had to return it for this reason, regrettably the book's contents were just what I was looking for."
2,Not genuine Wagner,"Wagner wrote this opera in German for a reason. This recording, with its cuts, is perverse. Christoff should not be roaring his way through the music. The tenor is inadequate. Callas was not suited to Wagner's heroines. Her uneven vocal production and lacking middle register were inadequate for Brünnhilde, Kundry, and Isolde. She had the vocal size for these parts in her early years, but she didn't have the smooth, even vocal production or the rock-solid middle register. When she sang Isolde, she had to force her middle. Nilsson had a larger voice than Callas and could blow her off any opera stage."
4,BETTER THAN PUNDITS ALLOW,"WELL, THANK GOD I UNDERSTAND ITALIAN SO THIS VERSION MADE MORE SENSE TO ME THAN ALL THE BARKING IN GERMAN. FOR THE RECORD, THIS IS MY FAVORITE OPERA BY WAGNER, AND I LISTEN TO IT FOR WHAT IT IS: NOT THE REAL THING. I'M NO PURIST. LISTEN TO THE DOMINGO/NORMAN VERSION--BETTER SUNG THAN BY ANY NATIVES. AS TO THIS PERFORMANCE, CRISTOFF AND CALLAS ARE AWESOME. YOU ARE LISTENING TO HISTORY, NOT PERFECTION, AS IN ANY LIVE PERFORMANCE. AND I LOVE MARIA'S ITALIAN ISOLDE!"
4,Principles and Rationalizations,"Well done. I think the author works hard to produce the feeling-tone of a small Wyoming town, with some degree of complexity. He also explores the consciousness of those with principles, those without principles, those with great spiritual attachment to the land, those with great (though challenged and/or flawed) attachment to the ideal of a legal system,those who rationalize their deviation from ideals, and those who cannot.Most impressive and chilling is the way in which Spence believably shows characters shrugging off the execution of an innocent man in order to further the economic benefit of a town or region, or to further their own career, or simply to get home early."
4,yon-ka-tore,"legal fiction that is both allegorical and poetic, yet somehow engagingly believable. tone becomes morbid, fatalistic and the tempo that of a dirge. excellent debut novel."
2,"If bad writing is made a crime, Spence can represent himself","Every cliche imaginable is pasted together in this horrible first novel. If uber-lawyer Gerry Spence had dealt with things as they really are, instead of how he would like them to be, this third-rate book could have been second-rate. For example, Spence realizes more than anyone that most of his clients are guilty, so if he wanted to explore the ethical dimensions of the death penalty as he does here, avoidance of the ""innocent man dying"" myth would have been a plus. But to quibble with any one aspect of this [weak] attempt at fiction is to imply it could have been saved; it clearly was beyond repair.The only reason Spence's first novel gets two stars instead of one is his colorful, textured description of the New West. Stick to reality, Gerry. From Freedom to Slavery was a masterpiece, and I hope you go back to what you know and do best."
4,Love these boots!,"I love these boots. I get a ton of compliments on them. The design detail (buttons, heel overlay) make them appear much more expensive than they actually are. Very comfy, I can go all day in them without feeling like I'm wearing ""heels"". Sadly, these boots are not going to last very long. There is visable wear around the toe (scrapes, scratches) and I have already lost a button. Another button is loose. Nevertheless, I like them so much I'm willing to take my chances and purchase a pair in black."
4,very good cut,this was one of my jams back in the day. Sting gave a soulful vocal performance and the background vocals were on point. I dug this Groove big time and it gave Sting a extra edge. this Jam is still a Groove and still sounds good. I dug the vamp and overall Groove of this Jam.
4,Egg Poacher Insert,"We love our new egg poacher. So many poachers cook only three eggs; this one cooks four. It fits inside a skillet and, because the handle is short, the skillet's lid will cover it. Each section is a rounded triangle, which is cute, and wider than a standard ""cup"" shaped poacher section. This allows the white of the egg to spread out a bit more, and results in the white cooking more evenly. No more jiggly whites! After some experimentation, I found that I could bring the water to a boil in the skillet while I buttered the poacher and cracked the eggs into it, then place the poacher in the skillet, cover, reduce heat to medium, and set the timer for exactly three minutes. Perfect eggs every time!"
5,Works well.,"Makes great eggs Benedict. Just put a small dab of butter in each well before you add the eggs. I put my insert in a 12"" Calphalon everyday pan with about 3/4 cups of boiling water. In about 2-3 minutes your done. Easy cleanup."
1,Kinda non-stick,"This item claims to be non-stick but hardly passes the test. Unless you use butter and make sure the butter fully coats the container area were the eggs will touch, you may get achieve non-stick but don't count on it. If you use olive oil, you'll be scrubbing the egg off this product. My view of what a non-stick product is means you do not have to coat the pan with fats and oils to make it work. I guess you get what you pay for. In this case, you get what you didn't pay for."
2,Not non-stick,"Such a simple item, what could possibly go wrong. Only one, it is NOT non-stick. How can Amazon allow a company to make a claim for their product that is absolutely false. They may as well say that this item will cook your eggs without heat. That statement would be as true as non-stick."
2,Not a good product,"Within a month of use, the non-stick quality of the surface stopped working, and every time I used it, I would have to *really* scrub to get it clean. Also, as others have said, it's too close to the bottom of the pot, so you can't put enough water beneath it. Too much water means that the boiling water overtakes the eggs; too little water and it boils away. I am not pleased with this product."
5,Great Value,"I love this egg poacher. It's affordable and works really well. I like that you can make 4 eggs at once if you want to, and the triangular shape is great and easy to work with."
4,Nordic egg poacher,"This Nordic egg poacher is very easy to use in the microwave.I just spray the receptacle with Pam, and when it's done I justflop it over onto an English muffin.Doris A. Voller"
1,Extremely hard to clean,"I had been looking for a non stick egg poacher and thought this product would work for me. Unfortunately, the ""non stick"" feature was non existent. I followed the instructions exactly, used butter or oil when cooking (I ask you, what is the point of non stick if you need to use butter or oil), and still the eggs adhered to the surface in a cement-like fashion. At one point, I soaked it in warm soapy water for 3 days to try to loosen the egg, and it still required a great deal of time and effort before it would come clean. I have since put it in the back of my cabinet and have returned to the old fashion way of poaching. If you want my poacher, I'll send it to you for free if you'll pay for shipping."
3,A must have!,"I would have rated this higher, but for some reason the non-stick coating seems to scratch off quite easily. I had another identical egg poacher for many years and the finish wore off completely, which is why I purchased a new one. All-in-all though, I still wouldn't be without this poacher, I just wish it was a lot more non-stick and had a tougher coating."
1,not non stick,"i have this and am sorry I got it. It is not non stick, spray it with pam, coat it with oil, butter, oleo, it is still not non stick. Do not buy it. Once you take the egg out, it is very difficult to remove the bits of egg whites from the sides. not worth the trouble."
3,Good and not so good,"It takes little room to store, and it fits right on top of a pan. But it does stick unless you grease the slots before putting the eggs on it."
4,Very Good Poacher,"I like that this poacher goes in a frying pan with just a little water rather than on top of a saucepan with a lot of water. You don't waste a lot of energy just heating water. While the directions recommend butter, I find that just spraying a little oil in the cups and adding about a teaspoon of water works and you get less fat. The eggs cook quickly and evenly and the poacher is easy to clean."
3,Sticks a bunch,"The eggs turn out great. Even with PAM or butter in each section, the eggs stick pretty good. After soaking and scubbing for a few minutes, it eventually comes clean. I am afraid the finish is wearing away due to the need to scrub so often."
1,'Non-stick' surface sticks and is awful to clean,"Save your money and buy a good-quality egg poacher that continues to work well after you use it once. While it is good that these egg wells have a flat bottom, otherwise this is a cheap egg poacher that does not deliver on repeat use. It is very difficult to remove the cooked eggs--they stick and break and take so much time to remove that the others overcook from the heat of the pan. We've tried everything and used tons of butter to avoid sticking, and no luck. The metal pan gets pitted in the dishwasher, and it leaves rust stains on the porcelain sink when soaking to loosen the stuck-on egg.The teflon surface is flaking off, and that is not healthy. We do not like waste, but the only thing to do with this poacher is feed it to the garbage can.We are searching for a good-quality replacement so that we can enjoy a nice Eggs Benedict breakfast with less frustration. ;-) We suggest you save yourself some trouble and do the same."
1,Cooks Great But Doesn't Last,"At first, I was pleased. As many have noted, it really does a good job cooking the poached eggs to your preference. The problem is the non-stick finish. I consistently greased the depressions with butter or oil, but within about 10 uses, the eggs began to stick. Shortly thereafter, the non-stick coating started to peel off. We exchanged it. Same thing happened to the new one. The product has a manufacturing defect and rather than exchange them after every 15 uses, we pitched it."
5,Perfect,"I am glad I ordered this product instead of a separate pan or appliance for egg poaching. After reading the reviews, I decided to go with this and it works great. Boil water in a sauce pan, add the insert, put a small pat of butter in each egg well, add eggs, cover, and cook until desired doneness. This is so much easier then trying to poach eggs in boiling water. I am ordering another one and one for my mom!"
1,This is a terrible product!,This is so bad I wish I could rate it a zero! This is not at all nonstick! IT STUCK SO BAD I ALMOST THREW IT AWAY! It is ridiculous!! And I want my money back!!!!
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,Not real happy with the quality of this product! Not to much padding for a dog to be comfortable laying on. New when I picked up the package that it was very light and could'nt offer much comfort for my dog!
4,not very thick or padded but I like it,"I like this having the paw print on it. The pad itself is not thick at all, so it does fit well in the crate and should wash and dry quickly. It is not as soft as I thought it would be. It would still recommend it."
2,Not pleased,I liked the print however it crackled Everytime it is moved. I didn't even let my dog uses it cuz I knew Everytime she would move it would crackle.
1,TOO EXPENSIVE,"I think this product was way over priced for the size and thickness of the item. Should return it, but will keep it for my cat. Was bought for the dog but seeing she is a 55lb. pit bull, this does her no good."
2,China Junk,Not worth $10.00 much less $36.00. Unfortunately I cut the tags offso now Im stuck with it. DUH!. Must be something it can be used for.
5,Jammin With Jill is fantastic!,Jammin' with Jill is fun for my whole family. My little brother who is one even likes to watch it! We really like the songs and exercising with the kids on the video. It is fun to do instead of just sitting there watching tv.
5,The best book ever!,"An exceptional book, very very funny, and very hard to stop reading once started. I wish I had read it years earlier."
5,Ford Perfect and Arthur Dent hilarious adventure,"This is the best SCI-FI book I've read so far. Its funny and really amazing. After reading it your concept of live, the universe and everything will change totally, you will never leave your tower or even your Sub Ehta Sense-O-Matic. Don't miss it or you will regret it. Mariano Luna :)"
5,Imaginative!,"This book is great! The whole concept of two men one alien, one human getting picked up by a space ship is really amazing. This book is really great and fun to read for teenagers and adults."
2,not too hot,Just bought and am finding it hard to get temp to a even 250. Firebox clogs with ashes and cools charcoal. Large chunks of hardwood help raise temp. I will probably make a cyndrical firebox with vent holes at bottom to allow better burning of charcoal. Go with a LP version or another smoaker.
4,Great Outdoors,"I got my smoker about a month ago and so far, I like it a lot. It isn't exactly set up as shown in the picture, but it is really similar. The water pan is a little smaller and the shelves are in different positions. I did have to add an extra grate to the charcoal box to keep the fuel off of the botom of the box, but that was a quick easy fix. So far, so good."
4,Charcoal Smoker,I've haven't got to use this product a whole lot. I don't relly care for the charcoal holder. its hard to get in and out when its hot. You have to have your meat on the bottom rack to get your meat done if you use it a charcoal grill unless your smoking something all day then its fine.overall its not a bad grill...
4,Good smoker. Great price.,"I haven't actually smoked anything yet but I just got through ""seasoning"" the unit. With a minor modification to the charcoal tray that another reviewer (JGW) recommended (thank you). I used a foil-baking tray, which I put on top of the (provided) charcoal tray. I poked some holes through the foil so that the ash would fall into the larger, original container that comes with the unit. I also used a grill between the foil and metal containers. Works really well. The temperature rose very quickly. Can't wait to try it out for real."
3,"Good except for ""Mungojerrie&Rumpleteazer""","This album is pretty good,but it plagues us with an unfamiliar and awful version of ""Mungojerrie&Rumpleteazer""9NOT the beloved video/US tour version we all know and love).The ""M&R"" version here sounds like someone ripped a melody from""Moulin Rouge"" or ""42 Street"" and slapped the ""M&R"" lyrics on-the melody tends to repeat itself over and over and over again,not like the varied melody of the video ""M&R"".The rest of the album is pretty good,but I never heard any ""Starlight Express""on it."
3,Partial Recording,The CD contains a interesting variation of Mungojerry and Rumpleaser yet the rest lacks in Orchestrational talent. What I mean is that it is a synthesiser composition and anyone can tell that. It is certainly worth having if your a cats fan. Also note that it only has about 4 or 5 cats songs on it the rest are Starlight Express.
4,Track listing,Track List01 Shoot Your Shot 6:2702 Jungle Jezebel 4:4203 Native Love 3:5804 Love Reaction 5:3405 Shout It Out 3:2206 T-Shirt And Tight Blue Jeans 3:5607 Psychadelic Shack 1985 3:3608 Shake It Up 3:1409 Kick Your Butt 5:2510 Alphabet Rap 5:4511 Divine Madness 5:3612 Psychodelic Shack - Jungle Beat 3:4413 Love Reaction (Calypso Version) 4:2414 Native Love (Holland Remix) 5:0215 Shout It Out (Montreal Remix) 6:01
3,"not as ""plush"" as i would have hoped","i guess it is a turtle; the edges of the shell are a bit rigid, firm, hard. overall, it's not terribly soft and cuddly for my 2 year old.our experience was disappointing; our kids (2 year old girl and 3 year old boy) loved the movie but did nothing with the doll. it sits in a basket with a dozen other unused dolls/teddy bears (which says something, right?). i can't entirely explain this but some of it may be attributed to the lack of ""cuddliness"" of the doll.of course, our experience may be quite different from yours. compared to other plush dolls at half the price, i'd say it was a definitely failed experiment for us."
1,Badly Made,"After a full hour of trying to get it to work I gave up, the batteries did not seem to be making firm contact and had to be jostled to even get it to turn on, heavy stomp or not, and when I did get it to turn on I got ridiculous readings like thin air weighed about 4 pounds and I apparently weighed nothing."
3,Bathroom Scale,"The glass bathroom scale just seems so fashion and it's not too heavy. However, it doesn't reopen quite well each time I restart it. And the validity of the weight seems unstable in a small range."
2,Not quite functioning,"Actually kind of disappointed in this product. Bought it because it seemed like a great deal online and it was eligible for Amazon Prime. When I finally got it and took out the battery cover to turn it on, I realized that it's kind of broken. You're supposed to tap on the scale and wait, then finally 00 will appear on the display and you can get on and weigh yourself. However, with this scale, tapping doesn't register apparently. I either have to lift the scale up off the ground and put it back down again to get the display to turn on, or toggle the switch on the back of the scale for it to work.Either way, that doesn't really make for a functioning scale. It's kind of a pain.But aesthetically it looks really nice, if that helps."
2,I cant get it to turn ON !!!!!!!!!!!!,I cant get this thing to turn on...i try and try and after 10-15 times BEATING on the ground it turns on ..when i place it on th eground ( and i have tired 20 different locations) it says 4.4 ...i had a friend bring hers over and it says 0.0 so the ground is level...this is the worst thing i have ourchased from AMAZON. i sent an email to the maker and they seem to care less that its crap. I had to buy another one and guess what it turns on with a tap...WOW
4,Great value-Gets the job done,"Came quickly and ready to use out of the box. Easy to use, just tap with your toe before you stand on it. Has a little switch underneath it to switch between kilograms and pounds. Only complaint is the initial reading is usually off by a hair, which is common with digital scales. Every reading afterwards is consistent."
2,Newline Digital Scale,"I like the look and the feel of this scale but I am not sure i would purchase it again. From the day that I recieved it, it hasn't worked properly in the sense that it does not respond to auto-touch as it claims. I pretty much have to bang it on the floor in order for it to turn on. After turning on it works just fine and seems to be very consistent with weights. I am sure I just got a lemon and should have sent it back..."
3,Nice looking but...,This scale looks nice and seems to work OK but the display does not come on by simply tapping the surface. Sometimes I have to lightly slam it against the floor to get the display to work.
1,Terrible,"I loved the design of the scale, but soon after I received it, I found myself wishing I would of spent an extra 20 dollars for a nicer scale. The overall quality of the scale is poor. I have issues with the batteries, because every time I step off the scale I have to reinsert them. Avoid this scale."
2,Inaccuracies,Scale tends to be off by 1-3 lbs and has to be lifted off the floor to trigger the scale to turn on.
3,HP 2605DN Good But....,"I owned this printer for just under 2 years and in that period printed about 28,000 pages. Print quality was excellent and performance was good. However, the magenta tone in images has begun to fade. Checking on line, I found that this is a common problem with the 2605DN and the only solution is to disassemble the printer and clean the mirrors in the imaging train. This IS not authorized by HP and will void any warranty. It also requires removing connections from circuit boards - which may be impossible in newer models. In spite of its excellent printing, I will NOT be purchasing another HP Color laser."
1,Stay Away,"The drivers for this printer have been terrible. I cannot add a Printing Preference unless I use a Windows Administrator account. I have to logon with an Administrator account just to print single sided! If you don't print in color (which I seldom do) the color cartridges will deplete. I added a blue cartridge about six months ago and it is half full after printing a couple of color pages. I will buy a black and white printer next time, probably not HP!"
2,A Bust,"This printer got the dreaded ""magenta fade"" after a short time. Do a search on Google: you'll find lots of articles on this problem. Apparently the printer has to be dismantled to be cleaned. I am guessing that will cost about as much as a new printer. I bought a new magenta cartridge to eliminate the possibility of damage to its drum. The cartridges on this printer are also expensive and seem to run out quickly with light use. The printer won't print black if any of the color cartridges are empty."
1,Horrible Color,"I have used HP printers for years, I administrate a network and have dozens of HP printers (b&w, as well as color). While b&w and spot color printing are very good, color pictures are tremendously dark. A print of a picture of a bright sunny day will look overcast and stormy. I have changed drivers and re-calibrated the printer to no avail. HP support, while normally very good, has been disappointing."
2,Pathetically slow performance - slower than 1984 LJ1,"I have owned many HP and other brand monochrome and color printers over the years for my law offices. This printer is the most pathetically slow device that I have ever used. Cheap color inkjet printers are faster and cheaper by quite a bit. Output is decent but advertised 10 ppm color/12ppm monochrome is a serious exaggeration. Printing basic monochrome Acrobat PDF and Word Perfect files yielded 1-2 pages per minute. Ridiculous. It's too expensive to ship back from Alaska, so I'm going to put it in the backroom and try to find something that at least keeps up with the original 1984 LaserJet 1."
4,It works fine. Not the best but acceptable for its price,"To my eyes, the printer's rendition of colors is above average. It isn't horrible but neither is it the best. Pricewise it's an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature.We've been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via Tray 2 (the default paper supply) and haven't any problems. The manual (electronic file) advises ""Never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels."" So it's a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label.A wonderful quality of experience is the near ""instant on"" (very minimal warmup) feature and it's quiet. My previous Okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing. Its time delay was also a disadvantage. I think most people will be very happy with the HP.[...]"
2,Not Good for Designers,"CON: This printer is terribly slow. Especially if you are sending color documents from any Adobe Creative Suite program. Often, the printer will fail to print the document at all. I even expanded the memory to 128 MB, but this did nothing to speed the printer up.Do not purchase this printer if you are planning on printing from any program other than, say, Word or PowerPoint, but heck - that's slow as molasses as well. My Epson inkjet is twice as fast even on a black and white documents printed from Word.PRO: Nice color right out of the box."
3,"Good hardware, software and support poor.","Print quality is really good and color is excellent for a wax-based laser. This would be a good product for a SOHO, it is inexpensive, fairly fast, and duplexes pages.Unfortunately, HP's driver software has a big problem that HP Support cannot either understand or fix. Once one of the systems in my office does not use the printer for a few hours, then submits a job to it, the job will not print! To get the job to print, you're required to stop and restart the print spooler. Fortunately, there is a CMD prompt way to do this, so it can be put in a batch file and an icon for the file can be dropped on the desktop to make it a bit easier for the users to get their jobs printed.I suspect that HP isn't interested in fixing this problem because the model is approaching end of production."
4,Great printer at this price point,"I use this printer at home to print out documents which usually consist of several hundred, mostly text, double-sided pages with color diagrams interspersed. The print quality of both text and images is excellent and the operation of the printer is quiet and hassle-free (no jams). While it may not be as fast as the color laserjets at the office--for home use, this is a great buy."
2,software forces early purchase of cartridges,"Good printer, however its software reports when cartridges are low in toner. Mine allowed the black cartridge to be replaced before the 3 color cartridges, several months ago. Today, the printer would not print, reporting all 3 color cartridges needed replacement. I did so, then used an axe in the back yard to cut the old cartridges in half. 1 to 2 inches of toner left in EACH cartridge!! The software FORCES the customer to purchase replacement cartridges = $400 for all 4 -- long before the actual need. Great job HP, of looking out for your bottom line first."
2,Not Buying HP Devices Again,"I had purchased the worst laptop in the world (HP Pavilion 8800 or 8080) and then this printer because I was an HP shareholder. While the HP laptop was the worstestest device any company on the planet or this side of the solar system ever made (besides some Dells), the HP seemed to work quality was just dreadful as time went on.Add me to the hundreds if not more online you will find who took good care of this printer and got the Error 79 failure, rendering it useless. This on a machine that I used regularly but lightly so it never even finished its set of original cartridges. The self-test page prints a photo of a baboon which is probably the HP product management team responsible for this (yet another) lousy HP product I wasted money on.I will not buy an HP device with my own money again (my employer just gave me a 2012 HP UltraBook that was also DOA but that is a whole different nightmare).Imran Anwar"
2,Bad for printing labels and cardstock,"For normal use (e.g. printing to normal laser printer paper) this printer works well. However, when printing labels - such as address labels, CD labels - or cardstock, it's terrible. The fuser doesn't fuse properly and the toner flakes off. I've even had the printing on address labels rub off during shipping - causing packages to be returned. My old giant laser printer never had these problems. I am really disappointed because I bought this to produce nice labels, and it's completely unacceptable for that."
2,"worked well for 1 year, then dreaded grey paper disease","Google the dreaded grey paper problem and you'll see that another common feature of this printer is that after a while, it prints a light grey background over the entire page. It's like the black ink cartridge cannot fully turn off. I'm reading thru the HP bulletin boards and it appears everyone has a varient of this problem after a while. Always after warantee.Also note that the printer counts pages and will tell you that a cartridge is empty after a set # of sheets. Then the printer absolutely refuses to print another page until a new cartridge is installed. This happens when the cartridge is about 60-40% full. Everyone uses the over ride on the panel to get by this cutoff."
3,"Quicker, but blows thru toner","I like the quality of the prints and the convenience of both the networking and the duplex. The speed is pretty decent and the thing hardly ever jams.What I do not like, however is the toner usage. Several people at HP are putting kids through college on what this thing uses. Be ready to buy a ton of replacements.The other bother is it just stops when it thinks it is out of toner, even though you can still get 25-50 more prints out of it before needing to replace them. It goes through more expensive toner faster than my previous Minolta Magicolor.It seems like a deal, but the consumables are quick to go out. I find I get 1000 prints with moderate pages (I publish my clubs newsletter) before they run out.If cost is no object on that front, everything else is flawless. I have yet to have a jam and I print lables and 800 sheets a month, and duplexing is great."
1,"Don't buy it, it's junk.","I bought this printer just under a year ago. When I changed cartridges, the Magenta stopped printing properly. I tried swapping out the magenta and it didn't make it any better. I called HP support and they tried to sell me an ""upgraded"" printer. Looks like they design it to die after 1 year so they can upsell you and leave you holding $300 in useless consumables."
1,HP Defect,I purchased this printer expecting it to be a durable long lasting machine. I could not have been more wrong. First I couldn't print colors. This is a known defect due to the internal mirrors getting dirty. HP refuses to correct the issue either through service or free replacements. The second defect which mine is also now experiencing that it prints a gray background on all prints. HP has also refused to offer corrective action for this as well. I have the top of the line version of this with max memory upgrades etc and have only ever used premium paper with genuine HP toner. With a grand total of 3811 total pages ever printed this machine is nowhere near it's expected service life. As a result of HP not making good I will NEVER buy an HP product again.
1,2605dn big problems,"My 2605dn printer was purchased in 12/2006 and it was a headache from the start. I now have had to send it back to HP for an exchange and it cost me $275 to get a rebuilt. HP brags about the color, the number of copies, and the work horse it is. I was unable to run card stock through it, the color just kept getting worse, the duplex was good but the machine finally just kept repeated the words at the bottom of each page after only 7200 copies! We have several HP printers and they have a great history, but this one stinks."
1,No Mac Compatible,"I would never use ANY HP product after seeing their utter lack of interest in their end users.They simply dont update software so that it is usable by Mac computers.. even though they are happy to sell these as ""mac-compatible."" With every OSX software upgrade there are numerous, unresolvable problems. With 10.6.4, the printer is utterly useless, even with yesterdays ""software update.""Shame on HP, and may they go bankrupt, as they deserve!"
1,Network Connection Defective,"This printer works fine as a USB printer, but it does not connect to a network. HP will not replace, says it must be something wrong with my network. Nevermind the 2 other printers, 2 Macs, and 3 WinXP computers connected to it.No more HP for me."
4,"Good 1st effort, definitely worth having","Trish's live shows are a lot of fun. I heard most of these songs performed 8-10 times before the CD came out. Some are better here, with clean arrangements and clear lyrics. Some miss the energy of the live show. She's a good songwriter, whose best I'm sure is yet to come. There are great melodies throughout, and some nice lyrics in places. In all, it's many, many times better than anyone you'll hear on a Nashville-style country radio station. The Teri Clarks and Shania Twains of the world look like tired hacks next to Trish's honest, heartfelt style."
3,Make sure you have an even smooth surface,"Got it for my wife, it needs a very smooth surface to attach. We were able to place it on the glass surrounding in the shower but you have to clean it from soap scum regularly or it will come off. On tile as shown it only works if it fits on a single tile (it has to be a pretty good size tile 4x4 in or more) and it is smooth. Ours have some kind of wavy texture to it that made it impossible."
2,Piano book,I like Johnny Cash but this book is written for someone to sing to and I just like to play the piano.
4,great grill a few improvements needed,"Great grill, assembly was OK...The five burners are great for a quick warm up. The knobs could be improved as they are just plastic. Also, the upper rack is too short and falls down when the grill gets hot. Still very satisfied and would get again."
4,"healthy, lightly sweet instant oatmeal","I enjoy many of the Kashi brand items, so I thought I would give this one a try. The flavor is light and not too sweet, which I didn't mind. But I noticed two things that put me off a bit: 1) orange bits, like tiny pieces of carrot, and 2) grittiness. I know Kashi adds healthy extras to their products, but the texture was not something I was used to."
1,Kashi Cardboard,"Blech. I thought I'd try the Kashi oatmeal since Quaker went and changed their Brown Sugar Cinnamon recipe but this was another disappointment. Tastes like nothing. And, as other reviewers said, no raisins like the product description suggests..."
5,Surprised! High quality makes a difference!,"I normally have a couple of packets of another brand and am satisfied. Kashi has a little more and has a much ""cleaner"" taste. I will look forward to the next sale price as I'm still a bargain hunter."
5,good stuff,"I've been eating this for several months now. It has just enough sweetness. The protein and complex carbs make it a very healthy and lasting snack/meal. It's also great on toasted whole grain bread. I'm no oatmeal connoisseur, but among the three or four instant varieties I've tried, this blows the rest out of the water."
4,Pretty good,"This is not as fancy as the photo shows.However, this is very useful and quite strong.I would recommend it to anybody.I would give 5 stars if the shipping were covered by Amazon Prime, though."
5,"If we have a child, no matter what age,","WE HAVE THE DUTY AS PARENTS AND ALSO AS HUMAN BEINGS, to read this book.Otherwise, we could be denying A GIFTED CHILD ALL THE OPORTUNITIES HE-SHE HAS A RIGHT TO...AND WOULD BE DENYING ALSO THE WORLD A TALENT THAT IS SO NEEDED"
1,Kiosk <1,"Opening credits lists an asylum in Washington State as the source and the date of 11/6/89 of this patient breakout - sorry, despite the docudrama feel it never happened on that or any date and for that matter in any state. Our Belgium ""Tax Shelter for Films Investing"" studio must have played pin-the-tail-on-the-map as a site location for their fantasy tale. As for the script it's usually females that are picked by writers as victims who can only make dumb decisions while being implausibly ""no way out"" trapped by bad whatevers but in this case it's a rock band group (How could all of them have gotten the same cafeteria jobs at once?) having to defend themselves. The whole thing seemed contrived and as artificial as the blood. You have to be desperate to want to see red stuff (sort of since the lights were mostly out) to last through this one. The whole production seemed cheap. Must not be a lot of investors (they actually listed their names) seeking some tax sheltering."
3,Friendly but not for young teens,"Epstein has some good insights and certainly makes Shakespeare accessible with her witty style and organization. It's too bad that she focuses too much on the sexual innuendo in Shakespeare. There were also several instances of the ""F"" word used in the book. My 12 year old daughter who loves Shakespeare was drawn to the book, but I, unfortunately, had to tell her it wasn't appropriate for her to read.The best part of the book is definitely the reviews of the different movie versions of Shakespeare's plays."
4,Good for storing,"It is nice 5 piece set, durable and handy..though I did not like the plastic covers."
5,Nice to calm you down,"I have this on my I-Pod Nano and when I'm all frustrated or feeling overworked, I just lie down and close my eyes and listen to this music. While I tend to agree the bird chirping can be a little redundant, I happen to like birds (my grandfather is a birdwatcher) and it kind of just takes me away from the hectic parts of my life."
1,This item is defective,This CD came to me in wonderful looking condition no scratches on the CD and still no scratches yet its skips horribly which is horrible for my practice as a massaeg therapist to have a CD that skips randomly with no scratches. i dont get it. this must be the best most relaxing music i ever heard minus the skipping in the middle that totally ruins the whole relaxation therapy session. not sure how to go about fixing this problem or contacting the seller.wonder if this is common from this seller of there Cds
5,Great CD,"I actually bought this cd about the time it came out at WalMart. I must say I have listened to this cd countless times and love how relaxing it is. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a good zen relaxation cd, this one is great!"
5,RELAXING,"I looked under Zen and found this awesome CD. It totally helps me relax and takes me into a dreamworld. I would highly recommend it. There are so many beautiful sounds in the b/g. If you are into this sort of thing, I think you will fall in love it."
5,Zen CD,"I really love this product, glad I purchased this product, and really quick and prompt shipping. I would tell a friend or family member to buy this product."
3,Good but those dang birds,"This CD is overall very beautiful sounding CD. I have one huge gripe that bothers me though and if repeated sounds bother you I would stay away. Every single song, I mean everyone has the same birds chirping every 5 to 15 secs per song. I tend to do college work and listen to what I call Zen music it helps me stay calm and makes studying way less painful. The birds on here however bothered me right from the get go. I try to play it low so I want hear them as much and honestly after a while its not that bad, but I don't understand why in the world would they put the same sound effect in every single last song. I also think if you're purely relaxing with your eyes close this want be much of a problem but if you do thinking work while listening it can be annoying. So far Zen Garden 2 is my favorite Zen music."
5,relaxing music,"the cd is so relaxing and soothing. i orginally purchased this from a wal-mart aisle sample machine, and had to buy another when i lost the first. i love to meditate to the music. i tunes doesn't have this cd, which is unfortunate as hearing it made my buy it to begin with. it is mild piano, flute, new age type."
4,Nice for those days when Hannity is just too much...,Very nice for relaxing... great for de-stressing during the hour drive home from work on the days when talk radio or commercials on regular radio only annoy me. I find it helps slow my breathing and calms my mind regardless of how tense I am when I walk out the hospital doors.It's like a spa in the car!Side note- the musical instruments that are high pitched make listening uncomfortable for me even at moderate volume levels. I always play this with the volume fairly low.
5,Music to Start Your Day,"I have purchased a lot of music lately in the relaxation/healing category and have spent many hours listening to music samples on the Amazon.Com website in order to find the best music. Zen and the Art of Relaxation has turned out to be my all-time favorite. I listen to it every morning, and it puts me in an upbeat/relaxed mood getting my day off to a wonderful start. The background noise of birds chirping fits in remarkably well and is not distracting but actually adds to the music especially when listened to first thing in the morning."
3,"Ok, but it already broke...","I purchased this greenhouse as an upgrade from a smaller one that I had. It is a really great design, and is pretty big inside. It is tall, but also an unusual shape which actually provides a decent amount of space. The many vents are great, and the shape prevents water accumulation on the top from flooding any plants inside. The only issue I have with this product is that it comes with two ""optional"" tension bars that are intended to support the greenhouse in high winds. Well, by the second night of having the greenhouse up these tension rods snapped. It was breezy out, but no more than maybe 20mph gusts and every point on the greenhouse was anchored down properly so the greenhouse did not sway. The greenhouse still stands without these bars, but it is not as taught as before. I basically expected a product that is a couple hundred dollars to withstand 20mph wind gusts. I probably wouldn't buy this greenhouse again, but it does work for the most part."
2,Tambourines,Item is fun and colorful and my day care children love them; however they are a bit flimsy and a few have lost their plastic!
3,"Irish Twins, Boston, MA","The kids seem to like it. for me it's much noice, but they think it's music. I wish it was a little bigger"
5,The Shadow Club,I read this every year as the first read aloud. The 6th graders I have are hooked. There are other teachers in my school that also agree. Every time I stop they want me to read more. Thats my cue how good the book is. I also refer to this book all year when needing examples of reading skills.
4,a fabulous night,"The legendary FRAU partnership of Rysanek/Ludwig/King/Berry/Boehm assemble one last time for another earth-shaking performance. Compared to earlier performances of this quintet (e.g., the highly illegal Met pirates), Rysanek is in firmer, richer voice, Ludwig beginning to show the strain of the killer role of the Faeberin, Berry ever more tender and poetic, and King perhaps somewhat less stiff while still in ringing voice. The usual big cuts, of course, but that is little enough to pay for Boehm's volcanic conducting. This sounds to me mastered a little sharp, which tends to make Ludwig sound like she's screaming, even when she's not."
3,jam on eddie,if you really wanna feel eddie hazel get rest in p cause the same songs on here are on rest in p only that version has the complete recordings. so if you get rest in p-there is no need to get this-cause you get all these tracks here only longer versions- plus extra unreleased stuff.
1,buyer beware!,"sorry eddie, but I had to give this one a thumbs down! its not ed's fault, but this release is just some butched tracks from the ""Rest in P"" cd and given different titles to make it seem like they're different tracks, foul! I bought it thinking it was a gem I'd missed, but if you have ""Rest in P"" forget this release, I felt ripped off."
1,Don't buy this book unless ...,"Don't buy this book unless you are into dry, dessicated research. Very few images; dry and didactic. What you might expect if you were writing a doctoral thesis in cultural anthropology and you wanted to bore the professor to death."
5,Even comes with a CD install Linux,"Even though I decided to use Vista instead, this Linux made easy came with a Open Source version of Linux on CD. I think that is Very Considerate it gives one a chance to try it, in fact at some point I might just do a dual boot with Xandros 4 Professional to open up numerous avenues of communications.Real Good Deal in a Digital Processing Computer Book."
3,Not Much Help,"I have installed Xandros version 4 and at the present time Xandros doesn't recognize my Canon printer nor my external DVD-rw drive. I haven't tried my scanner, yet.I'm looking for a book that will help me get up and running and I don't think this is the book for me.If I can't get my peripherals running I'm going to have to change OS."
5,Amazing!,This necklace is just beautiful!! You can see it is a real orchid. You can use it as a pin also if you do not like to wear big pendants.It is worth the price and waiting time...
4,"Get dirty, 80's style...","If you're looking to spice up that love nest with some classic wah-wah, then this really isn't so much for you. But if you want that eighties, fake [breasts], big hair kinda vibe, then this is sure to please. It's more a grooved-out jam rock album, that'll serve as a nice soundtrack to your own extracurricular activities. Yeah."
5,"cute, cute, cute","Wanna feel like a paratrooper without the bulky parachute?? I love these for field work - super comfy, durable, thick (but not bulky) material and lots of storage pockets with button (not velcro) closures."
1,"a return,,,see item above","misread the information so had to send back for the pair above...same goes for this pair, but for a tinier person!"
5,J.P.M.,"I've reiceived the item.I've to tell the choirmusic is very beautifull.I know something about the Russian Orthodoxe Church for I sometimes attend such a worship in my country, and it is known that it's ceremony and the music is very delightful.The received CD brings me on the same level! Thanks again!"
5,Time-tempered gardening wisdom,"This book is a gem among gardening books. As a beginning gardener, I've benefitted tremendously from Sheldon's experienced perspective. It's easy to get caught up in reading, planning and toiling and worry a little too much about the details I can't control anyway. Sheldon reminds the reader that sometimes things just grow, or not. She discusses many kinds of plants, so it is a book I will visit repeatedly as I learn more (the first time through, I knew hardly any of the plant names and still enjoyed it). Reading her book also helped me remember to stop and take it all in, not just rush about the yard with my shovel. I imagine that's the result of so many seasons of gardening - an understanding that the garden is significant because we get to enjoy it, not just because we get it done. The book is composed of short essays, so it's easy to pick it up and read a small, stand-alone section - perfect for a break in a busy day."
5,"Clear and comprehensible, yet at a high level","A great concise yet thorough review of biology. Everything is explained very clearly and logically (although like any complex subject you may have to re-read portions). But the authors don't talk down to you -- they assume an intelligent reader. What I really liked is the authors' commitment to helping you UNDERSTAND the subject, rather than just giving you facts to memorize. The historical and conceptual background they provide for different topics really helps you grasp the material. If you really want to understand biology rather than just have facts rehashed, this is the outline for you. (Note: I would suggest having a biology dictionary handy -- the Oxford Dictionary of Biology worked for me.)"
2,Not a good review of the material,"If you are trying to review for a standardized test such as the MCAT or DAT this book has poor organization and complicated explanations of general biological principles. What I look for in a review book is outlines of important facts and figures to restore those little details that my brain has wandered away from. This book goes into excruciating detail and lists far too many historical facts to be a good outline that refreshes and prepares you for standardized tests. If you are trying to teach yourself this material, textbooks are much simpler and have better illustrations-well worth the added expense."
2,Too much information... Just make it simple,"I was looking to get up to speed to teach an intro bio class for community college. After reviewing bio texts, I bought this book thinking that it would be a great summary, review and offer quiz questions for bio. I wanted it to be to the point, revelant, and a pithy supplement. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This book didn't highlight or sum up bio. It went into in-depth discussions that might be of interest to grad students. I looked at Biology the Easy Way and liked it much better."
1,no fue de mi agrado,"Venia con un defecto, no fue de mi agrado para darlo como regalo. Tienen que revisar la mercaderá antes de enviarla"
5,"GrandDaughter ""8"" loves her Chicken Little doll!!","My GrandDaughter, Maggie is 8 and stays with us alot as her dad works andour daughter passed away a year ago. she loves movies and was enthralledwith Chicken Little and all the characters. After seeing it 3 times sheasked me if I would please go in on amazon.com and look for a stuffed Chcken Little toy. She later asked her dad the same thing and she now has2-one at each house to play with and cuddle while she sleeps. It's not too big and is nice and soft and so cute. A very nice little plush toy."
1,Driveway Patrol a bust!,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM ""AS SEEN ON TV GUYS""! After two months the sensor quit working and is therefore useless. Of course their warranty is for one month. They suggest you contact the manufacturer but do not give you any way to do so. This item is a waste of your $17 (shipping too!)"
2,Driveway Patrol,"I sure thought that this item was going to work. It works, but shadows, sun, anything sets it off, and its quite unreliable.I received my monies back, and for that I was pleased.If truly needing a driveway alert, and american made, I suggest [...]."
2,Still into the OLD Dominance Theory,"Charlotte Schwartz still believes that if you let a dog go out the door before you, eat before you or allowed up on the furniture, muchless sleep with you that it will take over ruling the household.Dogs totally understand who controls the food - the ones with the opposable thumbs. If you ask for a few simple things like a sit before being fed who cares who ate before whom? You give up many of the pleasures there are in enjoying the companionship of your puppy/dog if you follow Charlotte's advice to not allow them up on the furniture or up on your bed.There are better puppy training books out there like Pat Miller's books - The Power of Positive Dog Training and Positive Perspectives: Love Your Dog, Train Your Dog. Much better training books for your dollars to spend on!"
4,Impressed!!,"Out of all the puppy training books that I have read, this one has advice that I will use and keep handy to continue using. I have lived with dogs my whole life and training is not a new idea to me. This book however is easy to digest, read, and follow! I have had my new puppy for two days..so wish me the best of luck!!"
4,Excellent,Great step by step instructions to help you with training. Gives new tasks to do each week with your puppy. I recommend to even an experienced dog owner!
3,Okay for a few things,"I like the book because it has some really cute patterns in it for hats and booties, but there is a lot of felting and I don't particularly want to felt every item I make. I also think that for babies people should stick with softer, less irritating fabrics like cotton. While the designs are nice, I would recommend using different material for the unfelted designs and seriously consider how sensitive the baby may be before using the felting designs"
3,Not what I was expecting But still Good,Bought this book to make baby booties for craft shows and friends. Found there are more out there patterns than there are simple elagent patterns. All the patterns are great. Most of them are pretty easy. Love the hats that match the booties. It is a good book. Just not what I was looking for. I on';y use about three of the patterns in the whole book.
3,Not a complete video collection,"Why would you put ""M&Ms"" and ""Not Now"" on the CD but leave them out of the video collection??? There is no literature inside the DVD, not even a picture or two. Just the cover and just the disc, like it was rushed to production. No special features, no interviews, no behind-the-scenes, just the videos. Kind of disappointing."
3,wheres blink?,"This is a pretty good dvd its just lacking alot. Its just the music videos of blink 182, it has no comentary by the band members, no behind the scenes, or even a single extra. The videos are cool to see but i see them on the internet. They need some extras even just a single behind the video would be nice. I suggest you just watch the videos online or download them, save your money."
5,this is good stuff,"even though this dvd doesn't have ''m+m's'' and ''not now'', I really dont't care cause the 13 videos on blink's greatest hits are enough.this is one of the best dvds blink 182 made, unlike the other ones.oh yeah, all fans will miss you blink 182!!!!!"
4,Men Before 10AM Too book,"Really nice black and white photos. i bought the book for the Mark harmon photo ""Mark Harmon 7.33"". I would have liked some smaller shots of other pictures that were taken during the shoots for the book on each page, maybe to see what was rejected."
3,Okay,The only picture really worth looking at was Vin Diesel (page 51). He's the reason I bought the book.
5,Well!,"I originally bought this book because I'm a Del Toro fan and the review said he was in it but he is not but I was still glad to get the book. Ms. Vial has captured not just looks but a very human side of these men and this is what I love. My special favorites are: Vincent Perez, Esai Morales, Gary Oldman, Steven Weber, Tom Sizemore, Robert Duncan McNeill, Terence Stamp and Brendan Fraser.Ms. Vial, think you could get one of 'Nicio next time although I do have one of him taken, it looks like, before 10 AM and he still looks good!"
3,Not as good as I expected,"I've had 'Women Before 10 am' since it first came out and loved it. So, I was expecting the same from 'Men Before 10 am.' If you're looking for celebrities who you'll know, look somewhere else. Out of all the men photographed I know less than a third of them. Most of the photography if very well composed, as I've learned to expect from Veronique Vial. As a straight photo book this is quite good, but if you're strictly looking for well-known celebrity photos, this isn't the book for you."
2,"Photos yes, text no","I really liked most of the photographs in this book, but Houston as a expert on men? Please, she has the sickest relationships of anyone I've ever read - and I assume her other writing is not exactly fictional. She's over-hyped, over-bearing, and a mediocre writer."
2,Men After 10 AM - Book,The book arrived in horrific shape - the binder was torn from the pages and many of the pages were stained with a white crusty substance.I was INCREDIBLY disappointed.
2,Poor tone quality across the board,"The sony NC22 in-ear headphones do not live up to the hype. I put them on and turned on my ipod and was ready to return them immediately. The treble sounds tinny and the bass is practically nonexistant. The vocals and drums are clear because there is no other tone to get in their way.To be sure, I also plugged them into my computer and listened to the same songs. There was no difference -- the tone problems were not from the player, but from the speakers.I would definitely recommend getting the non-NC Bose in-ear phones instead of these, and I am going to be trying to Etymotic ER-6i very soon."
4,Well....,"I gave it an extra star for good pricing (as compared to other noise canceling headphone). Other advantages which you might have already read about include: Really small for carrying around, can turn off the noise canceling function and still hear music, etc. Cons are that its audio quality is really not good (not acceptable for audiophile). Without the noise canceling it suffers from deficient treble, and while with the noise canceling feature turned on, it gives a feeling of overboosting. And this is just in comparison with an average Sony in-ear headphone.Now it's the decision on whether it is a in-ear, over the ear, or cover the ear type, and how much to pay.My first criteria was $$ so no Bose QC-2 or 3 for me, and I am ""reluctantly willing"" to sacrifice a little quality for light luggage and both noise isolating/canceling for my frequent plane rides."
4,This's all you need,"This is a very good headset, small, good sound & very good price, I can't believe who pays hundreds of $$$ for headsets, because all Speakers lose sound quality overtime."
4,Very satisfied.,"This is my second pair of Sony Noise Canceling earbuds. They don't compare to Bose QuietComfort, but for the price and size difference, I'm very satisfied."
2,Poor performance,"I have owned a pair of MDR71 before buying this NC22. Accordingly, the technical spec between the MDR71 and this NC22 is the same except that this has the noise canceling function. So I expected NC22 (which is almost twice the price of MDR71!) to give even better sound then MDR71. But it didn't! I was really disappointed with the bass performance of NC22. The high frequency handling is as good as MDR71 though. So my suggestion is that unless you are dying for the noise canceling function of NC22, the MDR71 is a much better choice given that its so much cheaper than NC22. I know, some of the reviews said that the material insulating the wire of MDR71 is poor, my experience is that this only occur due to heat. I left my bag in the sun (with the ear phones in it... my bad!). I have just placed an order for MDR71 again, I will write a review for that when you search for MDR71. By the way, I have also purchased the NC50 check out my review on that."
4,"decent noise cancelling, better than NC11","I have been using NC11 for 5 yearsit has good noise cancelling effect, but there's a problem: it always falls off from my ear, no matter which silicone cup I usethis one is lighter on earpiece units, that don't fall off like NC11the noise cancelling effect is decent, probably the best of the price rangebut the mic unit picks up treble, which can pick up some sharp noiseother than that, it's the best for the price"
1,Just ok,Just returned from Paris & used these with my Ipod. They do not cancel out the noise (evidenced by the 3 year old who cried & kicked my chair the entire 8-hour trip); they hurt my ears; they fell out of my ears; the cords get all tangled up; BUT the sound is pretty good. I'm sending them back.
5,Best earphone,"Great price compared to the Bose units and work just as good if not better. A great hing about them is they stay in your ears unlike the earbubs that come with most small music systems. Have used then at home, on a plane and at work."
4,Excellent!,"Have been using for about 2 months now and the noise cancellation is the best I've tried! Aside from Bose, these seem to be the best at giving you a quiet atmosphere to listen to your music. The sound quality could be better, but the noise cancellation far outweighs it. I recommend if you are a commuter looking to cut out bus noise or even train noise."
4,Pretty Decent + Hissing,"I picked these headphones up for $25 at my school's bookstore and I was blown away initially about how good these were at taking down some forms of noise (airplanes, fans, ect). However, I listen to headphones a pretty high volume usually because if I go any lower, I am forced to listen to the hissing noise these make when they're on. For the price I aid, they were excellent however I wouldn't drop anything more than $50 on these."
3,Faux Noise-cancelling,"I was looking for some noise-cancelling head phones that would drown out the sound of my air conditioner and fan at night. I did not want to spend money on the over-the-ear models so I went with this cheaper version in hopes that it would give me some modest releif. Unfortunately, the noise-cancelling does not work for this- maybe if I had a 757 parked outside it would have fared better? Eitherway, they did not work, they only gave off a slight hiss sound. On the other hand, the sound quality was quite remarkable (as it should be for $50) and the confort and fitting was excelent."
3,decent phones with weak noise cancellation,"I bought these earbuds as a replacement for Audiotechnica noise cancelling earbuds which worked pretty well but failed electronically after a year. These sound better, but neither block as much ambient noise nor provide as effective noise cancellation in the aircraft cabin noise frequency range as the ATs. Also don't block my lawnmower or subway noise as effectively. The engine noise in airplane cabins is very annoying to me, so I may gamble on another pair of ATs next time I need to replace phones. I got these earbuds at a very modest price, so I'm not unhappy. I think they have smooth even sound over the auditory range -- I listen to mostly classical music and acoustic jazz."
4,Sony Mdrnc22 Noise Canceling Headphone.,They work very well. While not as good as Bose they are much smaller and take up less room in a carry on.
4,Works great!,"I bought these refurbished headphones for listening to music and movies in the noisy office and while traveling on airplanes. They were like new and work better than expected. The sound quality is very good and they do a great job eliminating background noise in the office. They worked better than expected on airplanes. In the past using standard headphones I could not listen to music or movies on airplanes without cranking up the volume to the highest setting and even then could barely hear whatever was playing. These headphones eliminated most of the noise and allow me to listen at normal levels. The sound quality is very good, as well. They may not be up to an audiophiles standards, but they are above average for the average user. Battery life is excellent. The buds stay the ears with little pro lem. The only minor issue is the battery unit is a bit clunky and can pull the buds out of your ears if it falls."
2,I couldn't take the hissing sound,"The noise reduction works ok, and they were comfortable. The thing that I just couldn't deal with was the loud hissing noise when the noise reduction function is turned on..."
4,you wont know how bad your current headphones are until you use these,"this is my first pair of noise cancelling headspeakers. i did not want to break the bank, however i wanted a quality pair, in addition i needed the rubber ear buds due to the wierd shape of my ear canal. the headphones effectively cancel out the droning of an air conditioner or the city streets. i put these on when im on the bus, the whole world dissapears around me. i suggest these to anyone who wants a quality pair of buds without breaking the bank."
1,Doesn't work Now this stupid thing wont let me vote no stars,"Not much to say, IT DOESN'T WORK. It works as ear buds but there is not noise-cancelling going on."
3,Work quite well but a little ackward,"These aren't the best ear phones in the world, and for low level noise I didn't find them overly effective, BUT for loud noises they can't be beat. I routinely used these for long C-130 flights and they work well enough that I could listen to my Ipod halfway up on the volume with out any problems. These even work better than the foam earplugs when boarding the aircraft during hot refueling (engines on and feathered. I also liked them because they have a monitor button that you can push to bring all of the sound back.Having said all of that the cord is an ackward length and the battery pack is in the middle not quite far enough away to clip on your waist, and the ear buds kinda suck. For the money though they are great and I think better than my Boise noise canceling headphones.Oh and you can sleep with them on quite well."
2,busrider,I bought this because when riding the bus I would hear more noise than music. The noise cancelling is fair and the fit is also fair. I would not spend over 100 for this pair of ear buds. At best this is a 50.00 pair of ear buds.
3,Disappointed?,"I was hoping for a good earbud noise cancelling headphone that did not cost $300. This is not it. FIrst of all Sony advertises that it cancels 87%, while the packaging says 75%. When questioning a Sony customer service rep, he acknowledged that the Sony web page had incorrect information and 75% was correct.I do have an over the ear noise cancelling headphone, however, when traveling on airlines for many hours, it is certainly more comfortable to have ear buds should you want to sleep on your side. The comfort somewhat overcomes the shortfall of the noise cancelling capabilities."
2,"Poorly made, only 90 day warranty","I bought these a few weeks before Christmas for my husband. About 10 weeks later, we were at an airport and noticed that the right ear had no sound. Amazon gave me a phone number for Sony, but since they were purchased more than 90 days ago, there was only ""parts"" coverage and there would be a fee to repair or replace them and Sony refused to fix them for free despite being used only a few times since they were received as a gift. I would expect that only 10 weeks after they were given as a gift, Sony should replace them at no charge. They were only used on planes, so have only a few hours of use. Thanks Amazon, for letting me return them for a refund. Not sure I will get them again and what a poor service from Sony over this defective product."
5,this review is a question,"i automatically give anything by art tatum 5 stars,so it is not becasue this is a favorite that i did that. will someone please tell this old lady what he says in toledo blues..something about getting into deep water, and snatch your (what?) out. i was a lucky child(born in 30's) of parents who had jazz records, sometimes brought someone home who could play the piano, and took me to hear my ""sunday school pianist""(a joke that didn't please those in the family who thought real sunday school would do me more good) on sunday mornings. but i don't get those lines and i'd like to know it before i die. thanks!p.s. its true what they say about tatum, so believe it and keep listening to him no matter what other music takes your time, for the more you listen, the more you hear."
5,love all these collections-but this particular company selling it could have sent a better product,"I have no complaints with the DVD collection itself. In fact, I purchased all 3 collections as well as the fruitcake Christmas. My daughter loves them all. They are really great for kids to watch; they have good moral values taught;unlike the cartoons they have out nowadays. The only complaint I have, is that the company I bought it from sent me this collection with 2 dvd's flopping around in the box and they got scratches on them. They still work, Thank God!They didn't send a packing receipt to return them. Other than that I would recommend all these cartoons to any parent who wants to teach their kids morals and values and are sick of the cartoons they have out now with adult humor and foul things in them."
4,Great product--lousy customer service,"I purchased these replacement bands with the Oster nail grooming tool. My only complaint is that the directions are unclear and very limited. A call to the customer service number provided in the literature resulted in the following comment from them: ""Ma'am, we are not dog groomers. You would have to ask a professional dog groomer how to use this tool.""After much trial and error, I have it figured out now. My formerly skittish dogs sit perfectly still as the tool hums and whirls and shortens and shapes their nails. I highly recommend it....if you can figure out how to use it on your own."
3,Not quite as represented.,"-- The language is Italian, not the original French. -- There appear to be some major cuts (this is a long opera) -- If this is as good as Meyerbeer could write, you've really got to wonder. -- Yeah, the singing is good."
1,"Quite frankly, a mess","All these great voices in one place...it would be nice if they actually sang the music as written.Even Sutherland has complained about this performance. Though she was in fabulous voice, the music of the opera was virtually ruined by the sluggish tempi and especially by Franco Corelli's abuse of legato when he should be singing more rhythmically, skipping many of the written high notes, and omitting some cadenzas. Of course, if you are a Corelli fan you probably don't know much about music anyway, so you can just ignore this review and go on adoring his goopy vocal style.Overall, the finest ""Huguenots"" is still the famous 1971 Vienna performance with Shane, Tarres, Petkov, Diaz and the superb Nicolai Gedda as Raoul. Marzendorfer conducts with a real sense of purpose and drama, the sound is shockingly superb for so vintage a live recording, and Gedda comes closest to the Meyerbeerian ideal tenor. A shame it is abridged, just as this recording is."
5,"Joan Sutherland, the vocal paganini","Joan Sutherland, La Stupenda, the vocal Paganini is very great here, singing some of the most taxing coloratura with great ease and brilliance, tossing extremely high notes here and there, and trilling her way through the first act, she was the finest coloratura of the last century, at least. Corelli's ringing spinto sounds is immense! When he and Simionato hit that top D flat in the grand duet I couldn't believe it. Corelli is the most exciting of all the tenors I've heard, and he has all the high notes, and they're big and full of vibrato. This one is from the golden age."
2,"""Pure Reggae""for who? Boring white people?","""Pure Reggae?"" Please. Whoever put this together was so scared of offending Joe Armchair (who, by the way, buys TV CDs more than any other group), that they've managed to take all the fun and adventure out of Jamaican music.""Montego Bay"" is about as reggae as the Osmond Brothers. Just because you're FROM Jamaica (Bobby Bloom, Eddy Grant, e.g.) doesn't mean you necessarily do reggae music. Did you EVER for a SECOND think of ""Electric Avenue"" as anything but a rock song?Skip this and order ""Tougher Than Tough: The Story Of Jamaican Music"" on Mango. It has almost 100 tracks in all and is worth every darn penny."
2,PURE GARBAGE,"If you like REGGAE, don't waste $... on this CD. Although Marley's tracks are good, ""ELECTRIC AVENUE"" is about about as close to Reggae as ""Gangsta's Paradise"" is to opera. Hearing ""Bad Boys"" reminds me of a bunch of cops beating down on some guy with nightsticks. Some of the middle tracks sound like they were copied off a cassette. I know they are old, but if you want to hear reggae from the '70's go buy some Jimmy Cliff or Peter Tosh CD. When friends are in the car listening to the cd, they don't believe me when I tell them it is pure REGGAE. Thats how well this CD covers reggae. Also, don't think you can turn this on to get a party going. Most of the songs are slow and not jumpy. Bottom line, PURE REGGAE is far from being pure reggae. The last time I saw Erich Clapton, I'm pretty sure he was a white guy with glasses and not a Jamaican with dreadlocks. SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD REGGAE CD'S: Anything by UB40 or Inner Circle, LEGEND by Bob Marley"
5,Pure Reggae to Me.........I Loved Every Moment of It!,This is so far the best reggae that I have heard in a long time...I really love Bob Martley but some of these other artists are also wonderful....I can't get enough of listening to it....I love the songs that was picked for this cd....keep up the good work!
2,Pure Reggae for your grandmother.,"Even as a casual reggae fan I'm well aware half these tracks are out of place. As if they tossed on songs by anyone who's ever visited Jamaica or grown dreads. Sure Bob and Desmond Decker are classic, but a lot of this is way more pop, and not even good pop. But moreso this fails because of who's missing, not who's here. Where is Peter Tosh, Black Uhuru and Toots And The Maytals? Ever heard of Jimmy Cliff?I pray nobody gets this as their only reggae disc."
5,"""TRIOBOLIQUE""","Remake this one if you dare!Saw it originally in London [1975ish] - there were those usual warnings about the ""acid-bath"" sequence{s}, and by Jove they do surpass ""le Femme Nikita's"" litte disposal sequence! [Adding yet another reason not to use the bathroom unless the door is securely locked and barred from the inside!] HOWEVER, the immortal and sadly missed Romy Schneider illuminates the screen in this grim little gem about a rather kinky lawyer who enlists two sisters in a - shall we say - ""proposal and disposal"" plot. It all goes well until one of the killers falls for a victim, then it's slightly blurry and quite queasy!Cannot say too much about this one - see it [reminds one of ""Daughters of Darkness"", without the supernatural element which makes it really scary!]."
3,"Beware, Good deal but not as described.","Cannot beat the price for the two but, The Aluminum Metal Hard Case really is a Black Plastic Flimsy case W/ car charger."
4,Who Are We,"For the longest time I have been disgusted by the shabbiness with which the foreign settlers treated the natives of these great continents. ""We shall Remain"" offers a much more human account of the terror natives endured as a result of the ""European restlessness"". All I hope for, is the day that European sensibilities change in favor of recognizing and reconciling with the peoples of these lands. This telling of history is a sad and moving tale of the impact that greed and intolerance has on those, who by there very existence, stand in the way of unbridled, and unethical acquisition of land and resources to the detriment of entire civilizations. ""I Am Ashamed"" should be the title of an honest European retelling of the American Experience."
5,Great documentary,"Bought this movie to study about Native American's for my college class and I liked it so well, my whole family watched it."
4,We Shall Remain - critique,"Our product arrived in good shape. Thank you. The dramatized documentary is well researched to give the Native American point of view as white men immigrated to America. It is very informative. I learned a lot!The only criticism I would give is that the camera was so ""in your face"" that often I felt like saying, ""back off so I can see the whole person instead of just his eye and nose."" When the camera was so close, I found it difficult to know who all was in the room and who was talking to who.Still, my overall impression was very good. I appreciated it so much that I purchased one (from you) for my grandson who will be working in or near an Apache reservation. I thought it might help him to understand their feelings a little more."
4,"Desire, greed, death","What made the european think he was so much better than every one else, and he had the right to just come in and take every thing he desired, Like they all owed it to him...where does that thinking come from& when did it stop? Or did it? Just different methods. Its a disgrace to all human beings everywhere."
2,This is NOT a rose quartz!,"Don't be fooled by the product name and picture like I was. This is an overpriced piece of soap, not a quartz crystal!"
4,Great hands-on book,"Very practical, hands-on book for use in the hiring process. Includes a list of questions to ask references that has proved very helpful in our company. We've also followed its advice when we've had the need to fire someone. Easy to read. Highly recommended."
3,"Adequate, but inexpensive","I selected this bib as an inexpensive option for a ski trip. It worked adequately well. Med size was a bit larger than I expected, especially through the shoulder straps. Fine for warmth, no obvious flaws in fabric or stitching. Kept me comfortable & dry even after crashes in damp snow, but failed when tested against the puddles of icy water on the chair lift seats. All in all, an adequate & inexpensive option for ski wear."
1,I have not received the request,The request is not received so far and I do not know what the reason was taking the amount of credit card Is this considered stealing.
1,very disappointed,"San Jamar C3260TBR Bronze Pull Type Water Cup Dispenser (C3260TBR) Category: Cup and Lid DispensersSan Jamar C3260TBR Bronze Pull Type Water Cup Dispenser (C3260TBR) Category: Cup and Lid DispensersI am extremely disappointed: the holding system is VERY tight and makes it almost impossible to pull out cups. If you pull hard you get multiple cups.The only way to get them out one by one, is by delicately twisting them up and down from side to side! Not convenient at all, I am very dissatisfied with this product. :-("
5,crystal crafter,OK so it is not the same as polishing a surface but it really works amazingly enough. I have a huge crystal bowl - I am glad it is not expensive but it is pretty and useful. Recently I had some work done around my apartment and the person who did it put an unsightly chip that would certainly cut a person. I filed it smooth and since it is only about a half inch wide on a 14 inch bowl it barely shows. And this way the bowl still looks pretty. I keep fruit it and sometimes dry flowers. No one knows but me even though I've pointed it out.
1,Dreary,"Master salesman Libeskind knows too well that difference sells. Difference is a long way from quality. The museum is a poor attempt to project Libeskind's INTERPRETATION of Nussbaum's work into a built form. But Libeskind was going to build jarring, sharp forms regardless of whether the project was the Nussbaum House or a Church or a gas station. The justification of the forms are clouded in pretentious rhetoric and careless arguments masquerading as philosophical truths. One need look no further that the structure itself to see that it is drab, that the lighting is without interest, and that the rhetoric is already dated and faintly amusing. Now can we please move on to an architecture of reality???"
3,Great pictures unless your german,"I personally say liberskind in person at a lecture of his and was astonished by the magnitude and precision of his works, the ideas and making of his buildings give great testament to an awesome architect, BUY IT!! great buy full of information"
3,Ok but not what I expected,"This Cd has some good Christian songs but it is not what I was looking for. All the singers are well know names but the songs are not the most well known. If you are very into Christian Music, you might like it."
5,best crackers!,We used to get these at Costco and they stopped carrying them. I was so pleased to find them on Amazon
2,A little vague...even for a beginner.,"Nothing goes in-depth at all. I know it is intended for beginners but it's still pretty weak in my opinion. I understand the intention is to show you the path and leave the rest to you, but it barely even lets you know there is a path.I would personally recommend one of Timothy Albee's books for learning lightwave tools from the beginning, as I have read his books as well. As a complete reference as well as slightly more in-depth training, go with Dan Ablan's Inside Lightwave series books.I honestly feel I have wasted my money in buying this book."
3,For Beginners Only,"I had no idea this book was really intended for Beginners to Lightwave - and I mean Absolute Beginners. The writer even admits that they have only been using Lightwave for a few months before writing this book, so anything more advanced than telling you what some of the buttons and options available refer to is beyond the scope of the book.And it's quite misleading - for example, the amazing image of the building that is throughout the book on each chapter heading page would be impossible to create using the information this book provides - you'd need several years more experience and learning before getting to be good enough for that.A disappointing purchase."
2,The authors' bad-mouthing reflectors is inexcusable,"When I checked this book out of a library, as I read each & every deep-sky entry, the very 1st thing I did as I turned the page was cover up the wrong and misleading sketches. OK, some people are satisfied with toy telescopes (including 16"" SCT's) that are ""left"" (pun) to give backward images, but don't bad-mouth reflectors & other astronomic telescopes while you're at it. There are roof and dovetail prisms available that give a proper left- to right image, you just have to search to find quality diagonals of this nature."
5,The best for starting astronomy,"Clear presentation & lots of information makes this book the ideal starting point for a beginner astronommer.The most interesting objects for ""normal"" hobby telescopes (8"" and less) are described here without using the (very frustrating) HST pictures!I simply loved it (and still use it!)"
5,A wonderful Love story as if told by God!,"The author, Katherine Bell, must have been sitting next to God as she wove this masterpiece of the love of Jesus. You will experience joy, love, anger, anguish, and tenderness as you read this book. I experienced the recreation of creation as I took this journey with Jesus and Jonathan. Jonathan's Journey will be a blessing to all who read it. :)"
5,i got chills before the first song was over...,"this cd is unbelievable! probly their best one. the guitarist for this band has gotta one of the best the scene has to offer. great lyrics, i still can't get enough of track 2. if your in high school and your into hc, check out this song. the 7 seconds cover is great. from what i gather, it's a pretty rare cd, so don't miss out, it's insane!"
5,A compelling read for everyone.,"I knew Senator Knowland well, having worked for twenty years for the Oakland Tribune, and having had the unenviable assignment of writing his obituary for the newspaper following his death. Gayle Montgomery and Jim Johnson have done a magnificent job of capturing the driving demons of a man whose brusque and hearty demeanor disguised a complex and, in the end, tortured personality. This is a compelling book for every reader, not just those interested in the social an political history of the time."
5,the Absolute s#1t,"Hello?? When is the world going to give TECH the credit he deserves?? ""Absolute Power"" is yet another example of Tech's unique style and bumpin beats. This cd combines style with truely intelligent rhymes and rhythm. In short ""absolute power"" is the absolute s#1t. The entire cd will blow your mind and keep you coming back for more!!"
5,2nd FASTEST SPITTIN RAPPER/ BET FINALLY SHOWED IMMA TELL!!!!,"'Imma Tell' reminds me of a Eminem song (cant remember which 1) & speakin of Em, check out his click, D-12, on 'She Devil'. 1 Luv!"
5,Best Rapper in the industry today,"Tech N9ne is lyrical mastermind. He is a genious in the rap world. His flows are un-beatable. His style is unique and original, no other rapper sounds like Tecca Nina. If you consider yourself a serious rap fan, you must have this cd (along with his other AngHellic) in your collection. Your friends will be jealous. Absolute Power also comes with bonus tracks and a bonus DVD!!!! So you better buy this album cuz he is unbelievable no doubt! and Tech, if you ever read this man, come to Seattle, we're waitin!"
3,all 5s? pssshh.....,"This cd is Ok, it is not great, and it would be 10 times better if he stayed on the energy tip and stopped trying to slow it down because he spits some really wack lyrics with some hillariously bad hooks (biancas and Biatrices? what the heck). Dont buy unless youre a fan"
4,TECH N9NE IS UNDERRATED,"I had never heard dis guy til i bought dis, and i was blown outta tha water. he looks like he'd be some icp type mofo, but his style is sick and nobody can come close to him. props"
5,not a kid just dont have an account,I LOVE THIS CD! GEEZ I CANT GET ENOUGH THIS IS HIS BEST CD TOO THE OTHERS ARE GREAT TOO BUT GEEZ HE REALLY DID IT RIGHT HURR LISTEN TO SLACKER IM A PLAYA AND IMMA TELL THOSE R THE BEST
2,Uh its ok but nothin special.......,"Alright im not gonna lie here, the first time i heard this album i really didnt like it. Then i got the album for myself, and i have to admit a few songs sound ok. I liked ""Imma Tell"" the first single off the lp, the flow is fast and it sounds koo. I also like ""Slacker"" it sounds koo. My favorite song on here is ""Slither"" though. It has a nice flow to it. But lets face it TECH N9NE ISNT SAYING ANYTHING YOU HAVENT HEARD BEFORE!!! This gangsta rap is not real hip hop. Anyone can rap about guns and women, its not hard. Yah some of the songs sound alright but they dont mean anything, and for any of you peeps who say this is ""HIP HOP"" ITS NOT!! Hip hop is not gangsta rap, hip hop has meaning and it takes thought. If you wanna hear real hip hop check out JEDI MIND TRICKS, BINARY STAR, or NON PHIXION. Thats real hip hop."
2,Same ol'[same ol'],"I'll be the first to admit that Tech can flow, and his stuff always sounds good to me the first time I give it a listen. But when I actually sit down and HEAR what I casually listened to, I realize that while it may not be totalyl commercial in sound, Tech is a commercial rapper. This isn't hip hop, all he raps about is [women]and gats, and it gets really old. You might as well, listen to whatever MTV is playing, because you'll be getting about the same amount of originality. If you want some real Hip Hop, you're better off getting some Hieroglyphics or Common, but if Masta P and Ludacris are your think, maybe you should give Tech N9ne a listen. If that's the case though, I'd rather suggest that you start listening to some quality hip hop and not the trite, thoughtless rhymes that get force fed to you on a daily basis."
2,Overrated,"Dude raps fast, that is the extention of his skill.I'm sorry but his one liners are mediocore ""we veterans and better than you young cheesey cheddermen"" ...I bet he put a whole 5 seconds into that one.In all honesty once in awhile he has a decent concept in between his club/girls/drugs garbage he says something memorable.(amusing that is his subject matter when he is 35 and looks like a hobo, and what is with that goofy looking hair?)This cd is a little more hook oriented than anghellic so I would recommend it for background noise but that's about it."
5,Midwest Rap at it's BEST,"Tech doesn't care what people think here. That's the beauty of the FTI movement. Tech has more talent than the majority of the rappers in mainstream America. Tech's beats and lyrical content is above your average ""Krunked out mo-fos"" out there.. Tech has an agenda, and that agenda happens to co-encide with some awesome beats.The best on this CD are gonna be ""Slacker,"" ""Imma Tell,"" but mainly ""Worst Enemy."" I love that song. Anyway, can't describe the album well enough here, just go download it from his webpage, remember, it's free AND legal.FTI"
5,One of the best rap albums ever,"This i think is up there with the best . tech n9ne is one of the best undrground rappers out theire. there are so many good songs on this cd this ishow i rate each song.the industry is punks-big middle finger to mainstream rap and radio 5/5here comes tecca nina-good song like beat and lyrics are pretty good 4/5imma tell-great song maybe tech n9ne's best has sick beat 6/5slackers-really good song beats cool lyrics are cool too 5/5keep on keepin' on-good song slower than other tracks i like it 5/5gunz will bust-crazy song love it up there with imma tell 6/5bianca's and beatrice-ok songs a little diffrent but it nothing amazing 2/5slither-another slower song don't like corus kind of lame 2/5trapped in a psycho's body-pretty good 3/5t9x-i know a lot of people that really like it but i think it's ok 4/5she devil-cool song with d12 4/5worst enemy-tells a story like it 5/5absolute power-good song 4/5yada, yada, yada- like it a lot diss to don won 5/5"
2,Eighteen Chapters of Boredom,"Clearly Robinson did a reasonable job in outlining a COBOL solution to one business problem, but did not require 18 chapters. The text purports to be language independent, but yet makes the statement ""the value of a subscript must be greater than zero""; too bad for the c, c++, Java and VB folks.He does ok with record selection, accumulation and single level control breaks, but 23 pages on multiple level control breaks is enough to put one to sleep. The projects and problems at the end of the chapters present very little variety for the student and, finally, for the instructor there is something called a manual - it is really just a bunch of pages stapled together. Whoever proofread this one needs glasses.All in all, a poor performance."
2,"it's weak, but 2 or 3 great tracks","If you're not a Kinks fan, skip this. You'll be disappointed. But for true Ray Davies fans, get this for the wonderful ""Sweet Lady Genevieve"" and ""Sitting in the Midday Sun."" Also, ""One of the Survivors"" is pretty good."
1,utterly forgettable rubbish,"One of the worst albums of all time by one of the best artists of all time. The Kinks are undeniably geniuses and rightly deserve their places in the US & UK Halls of Fame and have recorded many of my favorite albums and songs ever. This ain't it. Absolute utter crap. I've tried listening to it every few years and I plain can't stand it. If I even make it to the end of it, I wonder what I just heard and can't remember a single song from it. Take the money you're going to spend for it and give it to charity or something."
5,"Which is better, Act I or Act II ? Hard to say . . .","""Preservation"" Act I and Act II are among the best albums the Kinks have to offer (see my review of Act II for additional comments). They capture everything that makes the Kinks great. Quirky, offbeat, melodic, humorous and moving. Don't believe the critics. As ""rock opera"" this is far superior to ""Tommy"" or ""The Wall""."
3,"3 & 1/2 Stars - Really good, but just not as good as the Klassics","First off this album gets unfairly bashed from many of the reviews I've read.Thanks to some other reviews here, I decided to get the album and was not dissapointed. This album is a bit bizzare, and is indeed a rock opera. For some, this may not be the best thing for you. However, if you are a hardcore Kinks fan and/or a completist, or into experimental/wierd music (like me)I do bevieve Preservation Act 1 is worth the purchase.The sound of the SACD is great, and the album is densely layered which makes the album interesting for multiple listens.Overall, it's a good album but doens't quite hold up to the klassics like: Arthur, VGPS, Face to Face, Lola, and Muswell Hillbillies."
1,Is it realy worth it/,I just purshed the book and I found it to be a waste of money. The classroom or the student can find them selves just fine without it. Do not buy it if you don't have to. YOu can always reuse someone else's code..........and the disk is just a regular floppy disk that can be formated.
2,Not for amateur bird watchers,"Probably a good book for a professor perhaps but I'm just a traveler who wanted to see pretty color pictures of Hawaiian birds so that I could identify them on my trip. The majority of black & white pictures in this book left me feeling....""unprepared"" for the wonderful world of colorful Hawaiian fauna."
1,Be Careful,There is a black plastic connector with plastic screw threaded ends between the handle and brush . One screw threaded end on my connector broke off in a few weeks so I can no longer connect brush to handle. I must have received a brush with a defective black connector. Need a new connector to fix it; brush is currently useless.
1,So disappointed!,"I bought this on Amazon about a month ago and had high hopes based on the product reviews as well as my previously positive experiences with OXO products. It seemed to function quite well at first but then some of the blue bristles started falling out the second time I used it. Now all the bristles from 3 holes are completely gone and others are starting to fall out. I don't know if anyone else has had the same problem or if I just got a ""lemon"" but I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this."
5,An EROTIC cd!,"This CD is actually EROTIC!When I ordered the CD, I thought I was just getting some great guitar music, but then my husband and I had a nice evening at home, I lit some candles, he put on this CD, and... WOW!Quite apart from the sensual aspect to this cd, this guitarist is very satisfying to listen to musically. He has an unbeatable combination of great heart and a beautiful, crisp technique. He obviously loves his music.I was intrigued by the combination of classical, flamenco, and ragtime on the same disk. There's even a sweet Brazilian piece. My point is that the guitarist makes this interesting mix work beautifully. In spite of the different types of music, you will find a strong continuity throughout.Will you find this CD erotic? I guess that depends on who you are. By all means, listen to this CD in candle light."
1,Disappointing,"Not at all what I expected. Any knot head can do this and making a book makes me wonder just how many knot heads need instruction to make a stupid looking pillow,"
3,A compilation like the Descendants soundtrack....,".....but not as good, not as eclectic, and without the standout artists (ie, Gabby Pahinui)Pretty middle of the road actually - a Sunday in Manoa indeed."
4,Top Polynesian Arts on one CD,"From a jungle drum solo to the gentle sounds of the Hawaiian low tide, ""Songs from the Hawaiian Islands"" covers a range of artists, styles and moods. You'll taste an authenic sampling of today's island sounds.""Lia"" sung in the Fijian language by an artist who calls himself Fiji, is a tender love song, sung in rich harmony, one you'll hear echoing through your subconscious long afterward.Several of the songs featured on this CD are sung in the Hawaiian language, including two sung by women artists.Featured also, are Hawaiian guitar artists performing jammin' instrumental numbers to solo voice and guitar with a folk feel.Available at Amazon, music you thought was only available ""On Island""! You don't have to fly to feel the warmth of the islands. Order today."
4,Good Overview,"This book is a very good overview of SOME debates and controversies going on in current French Politics, and make sure that you buy this book because you want to learn about these topics: state intervention (strong, weak, disoriented), impact of Globilization in French Politics (EU), interest groups and the role of private companies (notaires); the book doesnt deal with social issues much at all. If this what you are looking for, then this is a very good short overview, but don't be misled by the title."
4,VERY ORANGEY but nice,"The scent of this perfume is very nice but has a very strong smell of orange. I think I expected more like orange blossum but at first application the scent smelled like furniture polish. However in a few minutes it gets nicer and smells more perfumey, and I like it very much. Recommended as an inexpensive and lovely scent."
1,Don't buy it if you want Wine Series glasses,"Don't buy this if you want Wine Series Glasses. For the second time, we tried ordering Wine Series glasses and both times they sent less expensive Ouverture series glasses instead. They were immediately returned."
3,Wine glasses,"The four wine glasses were delivered as agreed, but the stem on one of the four was broken.It appears to me that they were insufficiently packed for shipping."
1,Bad shipping,"When I received this product, three glasses were broken. The one remaining glass is fine--the product was simply poorly shipped. Give credit to Amazon: they offered to send me another four glasses at no charge or refund my money. Fearing another set of broken glasses, I opted to get my money back."
2,Not bad if you like static to go with your digital music,"I have not used any other FM transmitters, so maybe they all do this and I'm just ignorant. Basically, the thing is always staticky. I have to turn the volume way up on my RCA Lyra for the radio to get reception, and then the signal is weak, so the volume on the radio has to be cranked too. The result is that any impurities in the FM signal are magnified and it sounds terrible. I have tried new batteries. I have tried several cars. I have tried all four selectible frequencies in various cities across the country. I have tried every position imaginable. I just can't make the static go away. I don't know about the newer generation products, but I would avoid this one."
1,"Static, static, static","I have to agree that the static is terrible on this transmitter. I, too, do not know whether they're all like this, but I have to assume that the fact that transmitters continue to sell means that they're not. If you tap this thing even a little, the signal gets lost. If I'm not actually holding it in my hand (very safe while driving, really), the static is so bad, it's inaudible. I listen to audiobooks during my 2 hour commute, but mostly nowadays, I listen to static.Avoid this product. Spend the extra $10 to get one that works."
3,Okay Cheap Transmitter,"I used this little guy for years. Only recently I had to pitch it due to wear and tear. It's a bit weak so if there is a station trying to come in it will. However, if you are looking for an inexpensive fm transmitter go for it. Just don't be looking for miracles."
4,Good Deal,"It's very simple to use. I've had no problems with it. I use it in all my cars and indoors as well. I have no problems finding a good station to use. It's a great little transmitter and you can take anywhere. It doesn't have the best sound quality, but for the price, it's well worth it."
2,Not worthy,I bought this and extremely disappointed with its performance. The signal is very weak and I almost need to place it on the radio to get a good reception. I dont recommend it.
1,Unmitigated garbage,"This is without a doubt one of the worst products I've ever owned. When inside a tunnel, I can manage to get speakerphone audio quality out of this. When outside, forget it -- even when tuning to one of the (ridiculously limited and close-together) frequencies allowed by the transmitter that has absolutely nothing on it, I get faint signals fading in and out.If you're thinking of buying this, do yourself a favor and rip up your money instead... at least then you'll get to hear something. I know I'll think twice before buying anything else with the Belkin brand on it again."
3,Meh...,"Range is not that great. In close area's with not a lot of frequency usage, it's great. Not good for volume either...Definitely worth the cost though."
1,Poor for big cities,"The previous review was right - this transmitter is NOT FOR BIG CITIES. I live in Houston and all four of the preset stations are actually already being used here (hard to believe, but true). The weak signal of this device cannot overpower the FM stations here in Houston and so what you get is mostly static.However, Belkin makes a better model that has the entire FM dial avaliable, and I have had a pretty good experience with it. It is called the TuneCast II FM Transmitter (F8V3080. It costs a few dollars more (I think it was $50, whereas I paid $30 for this cheap one) but it is worth it if you live in a big city. The Tunecast II allows you to find stations that are available as you drive around the city, and it emits a stronger signal (at least it seems to) than this model.BTW, if anyone can find the older, analog FM transmitters, they actually have a stonger FM signal and always worked great for me back in the 90s..."
1,do not buy,"this book is very poor. do not purchase. I am an intern pharmacist and it is in no way applicable to the practice of pharmacy. Having used this book, I have no better understanding of pharmacy law. I recommend the Weisman text for CA law, as it is a better book."
3,More than a Picturebook,"The book is somewhat disappointing in nature. Generally it only depicts technical details on several battles, and I'm quite disappointed on how Mr. McIntyre narrated the battles of Midway and the landings at Normandy. Although, almost 3/4 of the book are filled with black and white photographs, I think this could at least be a consolation for any military buff."
1,Terrible,"This is the worst company! I would not ever deal with them again!I placed an order September 18th and they still have no idea whats going on!They said they damaged my order and were out of stock, then I tried to switch to another item instead.I was told they had done so.Now They aren't sure whats going on!This is the worst experience I have ever had with a business!When I email them they don't write back, or they will respond days later with no answers!and I have already been charged!Buyers beware!!"
2,couldn't get through it,"I like trains and I was hoping to find more kindle titles. I got this book, but I couldn't get through it. It was a disappointment."
4,A Children's Adventure Series from the past,"This is cute little book, part of the Blue Domers Series, from the 1920s. It is an interesting trip back in time and certainly shows a simpler and easier world. I like the credo of the group of children in this series: ""If you tell me a secret, it's as if a stone fell into deep water."""
5,Rare but extremely good tech-house,"I heard most of these tracks and they're not bad at all. If you're into tech-house-trance, this is a must have rarity."
2,Use Walgreens to refill your cartridge!,"I take my still working cartridge in to get refilled at Walgreens, as the printer starts warning of need to refill cartridge. I carefully snap it into the hard printer head cover plastic & original box and take it in to Walgreens to get refilled for about 12.99 - 14.99 depending on what town I am in. Walgreens will even test cartridge to make sure it is working. Your printer has a memory of the chip information in that cartridge, so if you turn off unit and install, it works for me every time.This is much better than the lottery, or hit and miss of getting online IMHO.Happy Printing : > }"
5,The Sacred Magic of Ancient Egypt,I must admit that I was a bit skeptical when Ifirst received this book. I couldn't quite get mymind around how this practice could be restored. Afterreading Ms. Clark's work I can say without a doubt shehas indeed restored the spiritual practices of AncientEgypt. This work is a delight to read. The author hastaken an immense amount of research and layed out thefundamental basis for an enlightened practice of thissacred magick. I highly recommend this work to any student of the occult.The work is concise and thorough. It is a fitting addition toany occult library.
3,Not for young children,"As a Jack Russell owner I would have enjoyed a lot more time with the dog... The movie begins with the plucky little dog being threatened by his drunken, rifle wielding owner. Not a great beginning for smaller children but not as bad as when the woman who runs the orphanage (also drunk) sets it on fire and ends up terribly burned (later to die from her injuries). While all bad guys get their comeuppance and all good guys get the girl,the stationmaster's position, or whatever their appropriate reward as is fitting in a Victorian melodrama, it still wasn't that engaging."
4,A great healthy cracker!,I found a healthy cracker- whole grain that my entire family will eat. These are great with hummus or cheese.
2,Too Bad,I use crackers in my preschool snacks and the children and staff have turned thumbs down to this particular cracker. The cheese ones are OK but these are a bit too bland and boring. Peanut butter helps.
5,love love love these crackers,We buy these crackers by the case because they are so delicious and they go so fast in our house. Pretty good for you too! Ditto for the country cheddar variety. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
2,Burnt tasting,"I used to love these crackers, so I bought a box recently. I thought I got a bad batch since they had a burnt flavor, but turns out this is the ""new and improved"" formulation. Not tasty!"
1,new AWFUL recipe,"Beware---what used to be a wonderful, tasty cracker is now a dry piece of cardboard!!! Sometime this summer the new boxes appeared in stores with the blue banner across front saying ""Now with Tastier Crunch."" They are awful! I can't imagine that they test marketed these crackers because nobody seems to like them. I used to buy a few boxes and week and now I will never buy again unless they change back to earlier recipe. I give Amazon 5 stars because they refunded my money. This is because I called to check on formula before I ordered and I was told it was not the new one. Beware -- it is..."
4,Tasty and fairly healthy,"On a scale of 0 to 10:Health: 7 - The main ingredient is the standard flour, followed then by the 7 whole grains, so this can't be considered a true whole grain cracker. The positives are that there are no hydrogenated oils and the limited sweetener is evaporated cane juice.Taste: 9 - Excellent tastePrice: 4 - If you can find this for $2, it's a bargain. Generally, it's closer to $3, which is a little high for a 9 OZ box of crackers."
3,These are giants but this can be passed by,"I'm a great lover of the Davis Quintet 1965 to 68 and have searched out everything I can find by them. I bought this with excietment but: I dare say that Wayne's playing is pretty poor on some cuts. The mix and recording are poor, Carter being way too loud and electronic sounding. I also could have done without Herbie's comments in between songs. We all know how great these guys are and the level of playing aside from Wayne in some spots is supurb but If I had to do over, I'd have skipped this. Gets 3 stars only because of who they are."
1,Are You Kidding?,"I thought this sounded like a great album. BUT, when I heard it, I realized it should have been titled ""Julie Wilson Whispers, Talks, Shouts, Croaks, and Wobbles Weill""! It is a travesty beyond belief. That she was past her prime when this album was recorded is a VAST understatement. It is absolutely horrible in every respect except the piano accompaniment. Weill is probably screaming in his grave and would sue if he were alive. This was clearly a vanity piece but someone at DRG should have told her that this album was unreleasable. They didn't; thus, the memory of a great singer is tarnished forever. I know Weill can be difficult anyway, but Stevens, Kaye, Martin, and Lemper seemed to be perfectly at home with his music. Wilson hasn't a clue.No stars for this one."
4,gorgeous vocals,"what intelligent pop could sound like. mature yet fun, great vocals, worth a listen. they were around for years and never got their due."
5,A new follower of Robbins!,"As someone who never listened to any of Robbins earlier work, I am impressed, the only catch is that it requires you to do some work too!He demonstrates a great scientific knowledge relating to food and health, most of which you can easily check through a google search.A lot of his knowledge can be called old timey common sense, 40 years ago if you were constantly getting sick, and a person who never exercised and just ate tons of junk food, the doctor wouldnt just create some new dysfunction to diagnose you, he'd say ""LOOK, you fool, you are causing yourself harm (lack of exercise and diet)!"" Robbins will do that!It requires an actual commitment but I think this will make you feel better in your real life! IT IS AN EDGE!"
5,Anthony Robbins Get The Edge-CD,It's great! I've been listening daily and working in the workbook given - I am recommending it to my friends!
3,disappointing,"Didn't learn anything I didn't already know. Try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" for a great look at the nation's toughest football conference. This is probably just for die-hard Bama or Auburn fans."
5,O mejor de lo mejor.,"Describir esta herramienta es fácil, simplemente no hay nada igual es potente es versátil es maniobrable, y si la pones al lado de cualquier otra caladora entiendes que lo demás es simplemente un juguete, sus revoluciones no parecen tener limite en fin es una gran maquina. totalmente satisfecho."
1,Riddled with errors,"I am an MBA student-this was one of the worst textbooks I think I have ever had the misfortune to use. It was riddled with errors, which took me an hour to transcribe from the publisher's website. My entire class was confused by the end of chapter questions, which in some chapters seemed to have no connection to what was taught in the chapter. I and everyone else in my class wondered all along the way if we could trust what we were reading as being accurate. Stay away from this if you value your time and your sanity."
1,This book should not be used for graduate level study,"I was required to purchase this book for an MBA class in Business Finance. To put it simply, this book is terrible. There are errors in calculations from front cover to back. The describers used to name calculations are changed from page to page, without any consistency whatsoever, requiring a flow chart to understand what it is Bodie and Merton are discussing. Nobel prize or not, Mr. Bodie and Mr. Merton should be embarrassed to publish such trash.Also, the way the questions are worded in the end of chapter reviews leave little relevance to what was taught in the preceding pages. Often questions that are asked are open-ended and very ambiguous.I would not recommend this book to anyone and have asked my University to stop using this book because it is so flawed."
4,good for first year students,"there is a few bad review of this book. of course it is not a book for mba students, it is just good if you are in first year at university, easy to understand, and good introduction"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This book is the worst finance book I've come across. I had to resort to a past finance book in order to get through the class that this book was assigned for. It has no mathematical basis for serious students of finance. There are numerous typographical errors.An excerpt, ""To give a simple example, consider the choice between alternative A - you get $100 today - and alternative B-you get $95 today. Suppose you had to guess how a stranger, about whose preferences and future expectations you nothing at all, would choose."" This is UNIVERSITY LEVEL MATERIAL?!?Do yourself a favor, look somewhere else and do not buy this [book]"
5,A great book with probability one (I haven't seen it yet!),Robert Merton is one of the sharpest and clearest minded financial economists we have. This book is bound to be great. :-)
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,If you're a Yes fan as I am you will enjoy this concert. But it still wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be.
2,Disappointing Quality,"This was not their best performance,is not a complete show, and the video and sound quality leaves much to be desired."
3,NOT THE BEST YES BUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN..,"i was looking forward to dvd thinking how good the cd was. it should have been great but the sound was awful,a lot of soloeing instead of sticking to song. it was nice to see bruford & rabin again but kaye is not in the same league as wakeman. skip the dvd & enjoy the cd. what happened to lift me up??? not on dvd?"
4,Fantastic,"Um dos melhores shows desta banda que marcou a história do rock progressivo, muito bom mesmo, quem gosta desse tipo de música está muito bem acompanhado quando comprar"
4,DavidWhite 11-558 Sheath for,The sheath is excellent for protecting your plumb bob. The convenient snapping strap keeps the bob from falling out. The sheath slips right onto your belt or tool belt. I would highly recommend purchasing this along with a high vis gammon reel.
1,Feedback,I ordered a hard back for $4.00 plus $3.99 shipping.Why did you send me a pocket book?Micheline Conn
5,The Deliverance by Richard Wheeler,Richard Wheeler again gives us a delightful western in the Barnaby Skye Novels! I enjoyed this book just as much as the others in this series. Mr Wheeler simply cannot crank these stories out fast enough for me!
2,DIRTY BABY stickers,These are cute. Not great quality for the price. Should be packaged in plastic so as not to become soiled during processing.Would not buy again.
1,Arrived Defective,"The function button that controls the color did not work. Also, the batteries listed as included were missing. I suspect the item had been previously sold, returned as defective, and re-sold. Is that a problem with the product, the seller, or both? I would say both. Re-stocking a returned item without inspection/testing is a seller problem. The fact that the item was defective in the first place is a manufacturer problem."
4,Multi color flashlight,"This flashlight is pretty neat....never seen anything like it before. Firstly, it's bright! Once you get the hang of the ""tricks"" it can do, it's easy. Any of the 10 colors can flash either fast or slow, there are also modes which make the light cycle through it's colors-either ""instantly"" or fading...a really neat effect. The only minor complaint is the ""white"" color choice has some ""rainbow effect"" around the edges. This really only matters for close work and it's noticeable, but not annoying. The instructions are not written with english as the primary language...so there are some interesting translations, but understandable, nonetheless. It's a cool gadget, and fun too."
2,"Great light, when working","I purchased two of these.One is defective. It totally quit working right way.They are the coolest hand held flash light there is.The possibilities are almost endless.Like wearing tye-dye?... this light is for you.Make a trip whip! (I did this with one)Make a crystal display. (I made one)This light looks cool on any multi-colored surface. (posters and such)They are very cool lights if they work. Quality control could be much better.I am happy with the working one, extremely unhappy with the broken one.Expensive for one light.50% success rate here."
5,Fun and useful,"A good price for so versatile a tool. Multiple settings for color and flashing rates, fade-in and -out, and so on. It's not the brightest of lights, but that would be expected with the number of functions in so small a space. Well worth the money, fun to play with, possibly useful as a warning beacon when changing a tire or something, and increases visibility in low light by offering different colors that alter how well colored objects show up."
3,Buy it CHEAPER,"Great product- but check the active ingredient. The secret is: IT'S THE SAME AS Bactine. Yes, THAT Bactine. As in only six bucks for a FULL BOTTLE of this stuff you get in three tiny vials here. I have no problem with someone trying to make a profit- but this is outrageous. Don't take my word for it: Compare the ingredient of Viroxin to Bactine: It's the same: Benzalkonium Cl 0.13%."
5,FINALLY!!!,Just had lunch and right after I felt that first tingle... touched my lip and felt the Cold Sore coming on. I hadn't had a Cold Sore in probably 6 months and I was headed to San Diego for vacation in 2 days. You can imagine how pissed I was. Anyhoo... I went to CVS to get Abreva and saw this on the shelf. It had 2 virals and said one time application. I was skeptical but said what the heck... the toal for the Abreva and this was $40. Went to my car and immediately followed the directions and applied it to the cold sore. I could feel it starting to work immediately and within 2 hours it wasn't even visible anymore. Just to be safe I used the 2nd application the next day and it was GONE!!! My vacation was saved and like other posters on here I stocked up on this stuff just incase. This stuff is a God Send!!! =)
1,Not the latest and greatest,"I bought this product during my last outbreak but it arrived too late to be useful. So I had it on hand already for this current outbreak.Felt the first tingling at work around 4:30PM. Got home around 6:00PM, blister was not yet visible, but there.Applied first vial, being careful to follow directions to a T.By 10PM I could feel it spreading. Woke up in the morning with a full blown, large, ugly, painful, outbreak on my entire lower lip. Applied a 2nd vial around 11AM. It is now 7:30PM, while the blister is not yet ozing, it is very close.It is still very painful, and growing.I had high hopes but foied again."
1,"Selling past dated expiration product - ""retested"" and relabeled","Let's see, buy product that is past expiration date, presumably for next to nothing, offer it up for sale on amazon without disclosing it as such, them get it ""tested"" and relabel it with a later expiration date. My confidence in the efficacy of this product? pretty low. I have used the product before and been very happy with it - but it was within the expiration date of manufacturer. Now I have a product in my cabinet that I am not sure about. This is the danger with internet purchasers and the lack of disclosure about this is very disturbing. Could I return this for a ""refund"". maybe - but I am out shipping costs and time. Very disappointing experience."
5,I NEED this CD!!!,"This is a wonderful series with a haunting soundtrack. I have been trying yo buy a CD with the music, but it is impossible to find. PLEASE, re-print the CD!!!!"
1,belle dress,"This dress was very flimsy - more like a nightgown. The color was also much more yellow than expected, but I returned it without any problems. The company has already refunded me."
1,Sandpaper!,I can only think of one way to describe this stuff. It's like wiping your butt with sandpaper! Never going to buy this again!
1,Nothing feminine about being shrill,"In The Names of Things by Susan Brind Morrow, the author waxes on about the outstanding treatment she received in Arab/Muslim society. Their dealings with a truly educated and enlightened Western woman speaks volumes with how honestly these men treat the lunatic voices of feminism. I join their closed-mindedness in this regard."
2,Annoyed,After trying to battle lice and not getting any results I bought this because off the reviews. In my opinion if it does loosen the nits it certainly does NOT kill the lice! My two daughters had lice and I just used Rid to kill the live lice and the terminator comb to get the nits. Also checking every day for new nits worked for us. I also didn't like that with combing with this stuff i'm their hair I couldn't see if any thing was on the comb because of all the foam:-( .
1,Did not work at all.,"For our third bout with lice in three months, I purchased this product from Amazon in the hopes it would save us time and energy in combing out all the nits. Unfortunately, despite our diligent use of the product, it didn't loosen the nit glue AT ALL. My daughter has fine straight hair, relatively easy to get nits out of, and I didn't notice any difference in the ease of removing nits after using this product. I also found numerous living lice on her head after we washed it out."
2,Still found live lices after applied it,"I bought four bottle of this product after I read those good reviews of it. It seems work for my son ( short hair ), but not for my daughter. I still found 4 lices crawling around right after applied it one hour later. I am not sure how well it works. I shouldn't buy so many bottles without try it first."
3,Just another product without the proper combing technique,"We had 2 children bring lice home recently and went into an all out war trying to get rid of them. Finally we brought in a professional lice removal service who showed us how to do a proper comb out (using the Terminator comb) and an enzyme type product, similar to this, to loosen the nit glue. That combing technique made all the difference.While I agree that this product definitely serves a purpose - because the chemical solution sold in drugstores only kills the live critters - it is only as efficacious as your combing process. The combing has to be kept up, by the way, for multiple weeks."
1,Not for sensitive skin.,"Didn't work! Left my daughter with a chemical burn on scalp, neck, and behind her ears! Followed directions exactly. Very disappointed."
5,Actually works!,"Our family got hit with lice, and by the time we figured it out, most of us had it, and all of us had nits (eggs). We bought all kinds of products that kill the lice, and found that it's fairly easy. However, the tough part is getting rid of the nits before they hatch. Nothing worked, until we found this product. Granted, it took a couple of treatments, but the treatments are so easy - it was kind of fun!!! This is a great product!"
5,A Mother's Miracle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We tried every solution and method I could google--over the counter pesticide, mayo, white vinegar, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, listerine and all of them helped but none compare to this product that kills both the lice and more importantly the eggs, too. I was shocked when after applying it, I sprayed the Neon Nit spray to locate nits that they were all but gone! After applying it and using the Terminator comb to get rid of any dead ones, we were finally nit and lice free! Even better, it's natural--not toxic like the other products out there that don't work. I was on the verge of calling the pediatrician for that nasty cancer in a bottle,Ovide. Anyway, I can't say enough about this product and strongly recommend it be used in combo with the Terminator comb and Neon Nit spray. Don't waste your time and money on other stuff....it's a waste and you can spend that time cleaning and preventing re-infection instead."
5,It was my christening so I like it,This was written by my Father and Mother in 1944 as sent as a christening notice to friends and family. Due to the war and gas rationing no gathering was held but the book was the substitute. It does stretch the truth a bit and has an emphasis on the good liquor made locally. It is however based on true people and incidents. A PDF file is available if desired.James R Ferguson
3,Ok if you are after radio edits,"There are 2 different singles out there (3 if or the 2 track version), they consist of the followings songsOn the UK cd is:1. Half The Man [Edit]2. Space Clav3. Emergency On Planet Earth [London Rican Mix]4. Half The Man [Album Version]Space clav is a great little acid jazz instrumental, like so many instrumental bsides on other early Jamiroquai singles. The Emergency on Planet Earth remix is also pretty interesting, with a very early 90's electro feel to it. Overall 3 great songs plus a radio edit.On the Japan cd is:1. Half The Man (Edit)2. When You Gonna Learn (Digeridoo)3. Too Young To Die4. Blow Your MindAll songs are radio edits so not much of value here. If you are after shortened versions of some of these very long songs then it is worthwhile, otherwise they are all found on their own respective singles.This is probably the only version of this single you need."

5,"great, fun acoustic guitar!","Junebug is packed with beautiful, thoughtful, and fun songs that just get lodged in your head for all-day humming! These songs are about life and love and so on, but with a smart, insightful perspective you don't often hear. Alexis has made a terrific cd; I can't wait to get a chance to see him play live!"
3,"Good, but ultimately , Depressing?","I'm not sure what it was about these stories. I love Robin Mickinley stuff, and I've read practically everything she's ever written, and loved it! But these stories were obscure, and even though there was nothing that was very sad about each one they were just depressing. Each story left me feeling that there must have been something more to it. I was dissapointed."
4,"Enchanting, anti-archetype","These stories reflect McKinley's abilities to spell readers into wholly engrossing fantasy. They leave a different flavor than Grimm, more contemporary, and very original, and the supernatural is always hovering in the air--watch out or you'll inhale it."
3,"Good, but not up to standard","I've read most of Robing McKinley's books and one of the things I've noticed is a feeling of the story coming to an end with most problems resolved but still leaving enough for the reader to puzzle out. Perhaps this short story format doesn't give her a chance to shine as she usually does. This collection is a great start on four seperate paths for storylines (the fifth being too strange and nebulous), but most leave you wondering so... what next. The first is possibly the most complete, the second ends as if in the middle of the story, the third, not quite as expressive as McKinley usually tends to be, the fourth, mystically strange, and the fifth, the title story of the book, takes place in modern day New York, does not mix well with the others and is utterly undescribable and unformed. McKinley would have done better had she removed the last story and made the other four, (more typical of her work) a little more 'finished'."
1,Disappointing,"I read this book because I had enjoyed McKinley's the Hero and the Crown and the Blue Sword. The only story worth reading in the book was the Healer. The rest of the stories made little sense and had disappointing endings. A lot of what the author writes is unclear and very strange- ex. a queen walks out on her country to be with a stagman. Overall, this book was badly written. I recommend reading the Hero and the Crown instead."
5,"A must for student, independent, and corporate film-makers","The contents of the short stories can be found on Wikipedia or critic websites.What's awesome about the product is the ""Behind the Scenes"" footage. They give you alot of insight from the directors and talent as well as crew men. It's refreshing that there was so much detail involved with the special features before it was even possible to share it with viewers on a disc medium. There aren't many discs available that will take a viewer as in depth as this one will.The shorts are a great way to teach students the importance and simplicity of story telling while the special features reveal how basic and complicated the production can be.The only thing better than enjoying the dvd was the opportunity to get it under $6, shipping included."
4,Clive Owen the BMW Story,"Clive Owen-a BMW hell-driver is the better viewing in eight shot movies of car-racing crime-style (The Hostage, Ticker, Beat the Devil, Ambush, Chosen, The Follow, Star, Powder Keg), bullets fly around and on any continent police/special forces were somehow behind.Also stories are of a different gender, police/political thriller mostly and some comedy, regardless of context,BMWs were supposed to be the major point of attraction understandably while, once again, semi-mute C. Owen eclipsed all."
2,Video is not full screen,"I love the BMW films, I used to watch them online and share them with my friends a lot. This dvd sucks, even the case and cover art are crappy. The menue sucks, the video is not even full screen, it plays in a small box in the center of the screen surrounded by blackness. Even if I tell my TV to zoom in it doesn't fill the screen. Its like they got the low quality internet videos from 8 years ago and put them on a DVD, I was expecting at least DVD quality versions of this stuff. Still I'm glad I have it in my collections before these are lost forever."
2,be careful who you buy it from,"the DVD split into 8 short films. the six I watched are awesome but two didn't work on my disk. It is worth the price, just be careful where you get it."
4,Viva Palomar!,"Another great record from a fine, fine band that deserves a much larger, national audience. Having already mastered the spazzy pop song, this album explores some new directions, with a more mature, introspective sound. There are some jaw-droppingly beautiful sounds and Rachel Warren's songwriting continues to improve. Planeiac, You Dance Bad, Liquor Store, and Talk to Your Captor are standout tracks. I live in New York and have had the pleasure of seeing Palomar live, so they are one of my ""local"" bands. But trust me, they are not just a great local band. They are a great band, period."
5,Liberation for All?,"As the American society has moved closer to gender equality, such is not the case for most women in the world. This documentary collection is a must see for every woman, for every person who believes in human rights. While sad, knowledge brings hope."
5,love it,amazing and sad at the same time. I am having my women's groups view this. This message needs to be heard and we need to stop this violence
5,Treatment of women,"It was an eye opener for women and men through the world to the opression ,abuse, and demoralizing treatment of women and female children in third world countries. Education is the key to begin changing these practices, and this video shows how education can make a difference."
5,Must See,"I had read the book so I was was intrigued to view the documentary, everybody needs to see this! It's vitally important and morally your duty to do so - that may sound heavy handed or overly dramatic but coming from a person who never writes reviews such as this, I implore you to view this."
5,A Moving Book Full of Stories of Oppressed Women Throughout the World,"If you want the facts about the serious problem of women's oppression worldwide, this book and DVD is for you."
5,AMAZING!!!,Watching the documentary right now..You know we tend to forget what's going on around us. I am grateful for the opportunities we have in the the U.S. compared to other countries. I need to send a copy to my daughter. Theses are some strong women..
1,Buy at own risk,"There are a number of people like myself experiencing a slowdown bug that makes the games all but unplayable. Every few seconds the game will pause for a 1/2 second or so! You might want to wait until a patch is released that fixes this annoying problem. Check the publisher's message boards for more info regarding this known annoyance. When I get this game working, I'm sure my rating will be 5 stars once i'm able to run this game as what i've seen and heard have been great."
2,This should have been a whole new game!,"I love BSG II. And when I got this, it was such a let down. It has cool battle's and a decent plot but I think BlackIsle could have put a little more effort into this and make this a new game (aka BSG III). I give this two stars because it does have potential. But overall, a big disapointment."
5,Well worth the money and time.,"Buying a video game is like watching a movie, its not so much the cost of the game but whether it will be worth playing once you get it. This game is definitely worth the time and money. I spend most of my gaming hours playing everquest but Warcraft the Baldur's gate series are the only other PC games I play these days on a regular basis."
3,A little disappointed,"I loved BGII so much I played through it multiple times with different characters and trying to complete all of the romance subquests. When I finally got the expansion, I was disappointed to find the entire thing was one long, tedious, drawn out battle and you no longer had the freedom of wandering wherever you wanted. Also, the NPC interaction and subplots and the romances were the most interesting part of BGII and were for the most part absent from the expansion. As much as I loved BGII, this left me disappointed."
5,Excelent Game!!,"This game incredibly fun and interesting. Even for a casual gamer like me, I was drawn in with the amazing plot twists and climactic battles. Having played the all of the other games in the baldurs gate series, I think that this made the best possible conclusion to the story of my hero as he progressed in this amazingly deep and detailed world. If you own Baldurs Gate 2, I would strongly reccomend finishing it off with this amazing game."
2,lettuce romaine parris island cos cerified organic heirloom seeds,"only gave it a two as thats all that came up was two plants,not sure if it's the seeds or if something ate the plants as they came up,but will not buy them again"
1,Bait and Switch,"This page CLEARLY shows that the seed is being purchased from BOTANICAL INTERESTS. What I was sent was from TODDS SEED, a year old company I've never heard of that according to its website is affiliated with Buy Wholesale Cheap. I wrote to them and got a snotty reply that I should trust their product and wonderful (self-affirmed reputation). If you ordered a Toyota and were delivered a Ford..would you really want to hear that??? The only good thing I have to say about this transaction is that they did refund my money."
5,A Great Tasting Lettuce Variety,"Romaine Lettuce is easy to grow and adds variety to a garden plot. I have planted this variety several times with good result. The seed is reliable and germinates readily. Tips for planting:1. Make sure your garden plot gets at least 8 hours of sunlight per day for optimal growth2. Prepare the soil by tilling and perhaps adding a fertilizer (10:10:10, or manure). This will cause the plant to grow faster and with more green lush.3. Water every day lightly for about 2 weeks, then water every other day. Lettuce has a high water content, so the soil cannot get too dry or the plant will begin to wilt. Some peat moss worked into the soil before planting helps maintain water.4. Since the seeds are small it is hard to get the plants spaced properly. Once the sprouts come up, space the plants out to all for optimal growth.5. When harvesting, clip the leaves with a scissors rather than tearing.This is a great tasting lettuce and is sure to please.kone"
3,What came up has been good,"Although only about 40% of what I planted actually came up, I can't honestly say whether it is the fault of the seeds or just a bad growing season so far this year. The plants that did grow are nice and sturdy."
3,They came up but...,"All the seeds came up but they are growing pretty weird, like falling over and such. I don't think I will get anything out of them, they are too weak. I will try direct planting when the weather is better for it."
3,"Not stable, but baby likes it","My daughter loves to look at herself in this mirror. However, it is so unstable, it must be attached to something to keep it from falling over. With one swipe of her hand, the mirror tipped over and landed on her face!"
4,My 1 year old loves it,He cant get enough of looking at himself. Its small in size but he puts it right up to his face and kisses himself.
5,Great crib mirror,"My infant loves to stare into this crib-safe mirror. She also looks in it during tummy time. It doesn't stand on it's own well on softer surfaces, but does latch onto crib bars pretty securely. The bright colors are a nice touch and makes the mirror more interesting."
4,"Best mirror I found, kinda expensive for a mediocre mirror","The ""stand"" tucks into the space between the crib bumper and the mattress and stays put there which works out great. The mirror itself is not that clear and arrived with a scratch- even though there was plastic over it. 4wk old baby seems to like staring at both the colors and the mirror itself."
5,WANT A COPY?,"I have that CD and believe me, it is hard to find, infact, i know i had to have brought the last copy left in the WORLD!!!LOLContact me if you would like to purchase a copytyrox06@yahoo.com"
1,POS!,this thing broke on me less than three days after using it. had it returned to the factory and they sent it back and it failed again! save up and buy an IPOD.
3,Personal Review of 'The Magic of Star Dieting',"The contents of this book are deeply philosophic. The poetry constitutes its luminary feature. The illustrations are intriguing, but of mediocre quality. This book needs editing to achieve more clarity. Overall, a worthwhile venture."
5,Seeds of influence,"In Ladies of the Rope, William Patrick Patterson brings together the story of Gurdjieff and the women's only group of students he formed in Paris. The telling of this story sheds light on the formation of some of the seeds of influence that Gurdjieff had planted in the West. The group contained some brilliant and influential people mostly involved in the literary world.Once again, William Patrick Patterson brings together a story which helps the reader understand the teaching that Gurdjieff brought to us."
4,"Although journalistic style, valuable information","Patterson's style is the style of a journalist (which he is): very bon ton. Besides, the information in this book is of high value, as it is one of the very few sources for information of a period of Gurdjieff's work in Paris."
3,Not great...,"I used this for a year and it did nothing for my skin. After using it your face is smooth, but you get that from any type of product like this. Look into Dr. Brandt or Philosophy products over this."
5,Love this enzyme mask,"I've been using this for years, I think it's the best one that I've tried. It's packed with a lot of ingredients. I think Z. Bigatti helps me look younger than I am!"
4,Fun Read.,"Though I'm not a real fan of Sci-Fi, futuristic stuff, this one had me reading to the end. Great characters!"
1,Glad this un-gripping story was free,"Jaden is a very unpleasant character - sure, she has a purpose to defeat her ancient enemy, but she is impatient, demanding and selfish. While the reader is told her back-story, Brian is working in the dark, she knows he's never known the story in any incarnation, yet not once does she bother to sit down and try to explain; she just mouthes off at him that he's an idiot.Brian is inconsistent. Why was he masquerading as a street hustler? If there was an explanation, I missed it.The Judge had an amazing ability to multi-task and warp time, because he seems to be finding and torturing a new victim every 10 minutes. When and how does he identify and capture all of them? Why has he never been caught out? Why haven't the police ever noticed what's happening?Forget it, I gave up very quickly."
3,ehhh.,"The idea is really interesting, but the writing it self falls short of interesting. Overall, not the worst thing you could read if you have time."
5,Annemieke Mein to the Rescue,"To a person interested in needlework, quilting and embroidery this is one of the most interesting books available. The use of pictures and discussions arrest the eye and stimulate the imagination. I wholly recommend this for the artist in all of us!"
2,Loud Clunking From Day One,"I am having to send my pasta machine back because it has made loud clunking noises from day 1. I tried using it two more times just to see if it wasn't put together correctly but it clunked each time. It took 4 calls to tech support just to get authorization to get it fixed, and every support technician gave me a different price for shipping costs. I will be sending it back for repair, I just wonder if I will get it back or not!"
2,Difficulty,I found this machine to be inadequate. The top cover did not fit properly until I filed down a piece of plastic blocking it.Several times during the pasta making process the front cover broke free and could not be reset until the whole machine was taken apart. I could not get the pasta to come out without some kind of flour stuck to the outside and having it fall apart into small pieces despite my making it more wet or more dry. (All of this took place while I was making about ten to fifteen batches in a row)
1,Not up to expectations,I used this product only once and was not satisfied. It certainly does not make pasta which is up to my expectations.
4,A request,"The machine looks wonderful and I want to purchase it, but I see that it not sent out of America. Is there any chance that will change so that I can have one sent to Israel?Thanks!"
2,They should call this a sausage maker Pasta at your own risk,"We were so excited to get this machine only to find out that it is mainly made of acrylic easy to break plastic. When we tried to make fettuccini our first try it got so overloaded we thought it would explode, as the front plates began to crack. The parts clearly could not manage the pressure. We were able to make sausage without trouble but I got it for Pasta! I was unable to return this item (bought online) and am very disappointed. I wished I'd purchased a metal pasta maker. Pain to clean and easily broken - was not worth what it cost."
2,For An Italian It's A Mistake,"If I hadn't grown up rolling my own pasta by hand then I would probably love it. I find myself using the lasagne attachment and then rolling the pasta thinner. It is also difficult to adapt other pasta recipes to the machine. Our family recipe for pasta would probably break the machine. Also, some that I've found in cookbooks won't adapt well either. The pasta maker is easy to use and really does work well. The machine is great for anyone who knows no better, or wants to make sausage. For an Italian, it's a mistake."
4,Great with one caveat.,"After trying several other brands of these type of automatic pasta makers, this is the only one that can truly get the job done. The others have motors which are woefully underpowered to extrude the pasta. There are other little features and design characteristics which also put this unit above the rest. The only problem is that you must expect to replace 2 of the plastic parts after approximately every 50 uses. This is a pain since the RONCO parts department is difficult to reach and VERY slow to ship the parts. The bottom-line however is that if you want an automatic pasta maker, this is the best of what is out there."
4,Great machine - clean up is easy.,"This is a great machine - easy to use, particularly if you make pasta in bulk and freeze what you don't need. Contrary to what some say, cleanup is not hard. Just don't try to clean it while the dough left on the machine is still moist. Just leave it for a few hours (or overnight), until the dough is dry and it just flakes off. You can clean the machine simply by wiping it off with a tea towel. It take a little practice, but the results are great. The machine is good quality. Only reservation is that the results with finer pastas such as angel hair are mixed."
3,Its FLIMSY AND COMES WITH LARGE BLACK PRINTING on it! ;-/,"Its functional for a toddler. We wish we had bought the Cute, Pink, WELL-MADE one we saw at Toys-R-Us! This one is very cheaply made!!! You get what you pay for AND it is NOT as described!!! It comes with LARGE printing across the front! DISAPPOINTING!!! ;-/"
1,Lacks a lot,"My daughter wanted to learn spanish, I thought this would help. It really does not have very much to it. It is a really, really, really basic start."
3,my bad,"3.5 stars really. i *should* know better than to buy jewelry with plastic beads but these are really cute and, for the price, i couldn't resist. anyway, as expected, i lost one bead within 12 hours (ok, that was unexpectedly quick but i knew it would happen eventually) and have lost 5 of 8 beads and one of the horseshoes since then. i may pick up more at some point. cheap and cute is hard to pass up."
2,Salt & Pepper Shakers,One of the shakers had a defective plastic tab in the base. We had to add a layer of tape in order to keep pepper/salt from leaking out.
2,Impractical shakers,"When we purchased new Corelle dinnerware, we decided to order these shakers that matched. They do match well, but we were disappointed on two counts: 1) the holes in the tops are very large, dispensing too much salt (especially) or pepper; 2) the shakers are not made of the Corelle Pyrex glass that we expected, but of ceramic pottery, which is much more apt to chip or break, especially with our granite countertops."
1,S&P set - Callaway pattern - not like the pix,"didn't look like the photo, or the orginal one I bought years ago. Apparently the style changed and although it is the same pattern, I don't really care for it as much. But it does match my set. Your picture is of the original one, not the one sent"
4,Shakers to Match my Plates,"They are nice shakers, I just wish the holes weren't so large. Other than that. Easy to fill, easy to grip. Will buy from this vendor again when a new pattern is purchased."
5,"Timeless themes, excellent writing and a cultivation of awe.","Some subjects never go out of style -- WWII is one of them. Franco's/Spellman's storytelling is riveting, fascinating and, at times, humorous. Its content is as meaningful to women (myself included) as it is to men. The theme of racial intolerance is one that continues to be incredibly important and timely -- witness the Yugoslavian/Serbian issue. This is one of those books you want to curl up with on the weekend and not stop until you're done."
2,Mr Asprin? Where are you?!?!,"When I read this book, I was disappointed from the get go. The earlier style of humor and character interaction is just not there anymore. Almost to the point that I feel Jodi Lynn Nye seems to have done all the writing and Mr. Asprin just has his name on the cover. Either that or Aprin's style has changed dramatically since the earlier books in this series. About the only positive thing I can say about this book is they have Phil Foglio back doing the artwork so it at least LOOKS like a Myth book again (which is the only reason I gave it two stars). Too bad the stories just do not go anywhere anymore and entertain us like they used to."
4,Class dis-mythed,A good read for those who like the Myth books or Robert Asprin.But I found myself missing AHZ and the rest of the crew
4,Simple view of a simple life,"This is a mid-grade level reader in 10 chapters: Man of North India, the Village of Phulpur, Shoba at Home, Hari Singh's Farm, A Good Cow for Hari Singh, Life--Gift of the Monsoon, Cobra in a Corner, The Harvest, Pusa, Magic for Every Farmer. Copyright 1956, with 2 or 3 B&W photos in every chapter, and simple maps; the whole evokes the timeless way of life on farm, in the home, and in the village, and ends with a hope of coming change through better farm management."
5,Passion Dance by Tomas Michaud,"If you liked Best of Gipsy Kings & Yanni's Reflections of Passion, you will probably like this one. I find it's soothing yet foot tapping lively sounds perfect no matter what I'm doing: housework, mealtime, reading or entertaining. Hubby (60's rock n roll fan) even enjoys it - there's a lot he says - 'shut it off please'. He refers to Yanni as Yawni if that helps."
1,Very uncomfortable!,I just took them to consignment after trying them on. Will never buy shoes online again. They looked great but that's it.
1,Awful,"I bought these, thinking that the CD-Rs would enhance the music, and a 30-pack was a great deal.Not really...First, I've had more burn failing than anything else. So, I've had many times when the CD would do only part of a CD I wanted to burn.Secondly, they have a hard time reading in my truck, and in some other CD-R compatible players.Thirdly, where is the album track thing, were you right the track, artist, and time. Almost every Music CD-R pack has this.Finally, and most importantly, they really don't work. They are supposed to boost and enchance the quality of the music (or that is I think they should), and I haven't seen any difference from normal CD-Rs from Maxell, TDK, and Samsung.Overall, try Maxell, TDK, and Samsung. Those seem to work perfectly fine for me, unless your burner can't handle these brands."
4,I'm pleased,"I've used these discs in the past, and have been happy with them. Occasionally, you will get one that doesn't work right. But, out of 30, that's not bad."
3,Not much of a difference,"I always figured that ""music"" CD-R's and ""data"" CD-R's were the same physically, except that companies had to pay royalty fees to recording assocications for sales of music CD-R's. The idea is that people with stand alone burners hooked up to their stereos and not a computer, can't use the excuse of ""I also use my CD Writer to store my data files."" I agree ... that brands matter, buying a no name brand usually means buying a flimsy, easily scatched or cracked disc. But if I'm just burning a few badly recorded MP3's that I downloaded off the 'net to listen in my car, I don't care much about the length of the disc's life. It's not like I'll want to listen to an old disc of Britney five years from now ( *ahem* not that I would listen to her in the first place)...."
1,"""YES VIRGINIA, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'MUSIC' AND 'DATA' CDS!""","I don't wanted to sound rude, but please don't put misinformation out there if you're not sure of what you're talking about! Of course there's a difference. If you are recording on a home stereo cd recorder, you do need the cd-r music cd's. The data cd's will not work! I don't know why for sure, I can only hypothise that it possibly stems from the legal squabblings of the record companies over the sale of home stereo cassette recorders back in the 70's. Anybody remember? Thanks."
1,Very poor with stand alone CD recorder,"I have a Mazantz 631 professional CD recorder embedded in my A/V system. I purchased a 30 pack of these Merorex ""white label"" 700MB disks. The first 5 out of the box would not record: OPC error. They cost $0.66 a piece. In this case, you get what you pay for."
1,The cds I bought,"I bought a 50 pack of memorex 700mb 80 min. cds and i would say that we have tryed to record on about 20 cds and only about 10 have worked. I get errors that the cd isnt recordable or the calabration area is full. And I thought it was my software so I bought a new program, and it still does it. I had my burner checked and they said that it was fine, so it has to be your discs. I wont by theme again if I am going to have this problem every time. So if you know why this is happening please write back to my E-mail address. Thanks Jay"
1,Let the confusion begin,"Weiss must think he's gods gift to C++ programming, because this book was written way beyond the level of a student trying to first learn his material. Very poorly written, confusing, with pseudocode which left the reader hanging. Definately, DO NOT buy this book unless forced to due to homework problems, for it will rot on your bookshelf for eternity, daunting you that such a book was ever even published for student use.A pity that such a distinguished professor would take the time to publish such a horrible book only to torment struggling CS students."
4,wild musical journey,"Haunts, the third US album by the New York-based Chinese experimental singer Liu Sola, is a wild musical journey that sounds both primitive and futuristic. Alongside bassist/guitarist Fernando Saunders, drummer Pheeroan akLaff and keyboardist/vocalist Amina Claudine Myers, Sola wends her way through seven ambitious, electic tracks, overlaying jazz riffs with vocals of exceptional range. At times her voice warbles like a bird in mating season; at other times it sinks as deep as a chasm or soars like a rainbow in the night. Her ideas are not populist ones, but that's precisely where she derives her greatest powers."
4,Duplicate material,"If you like British comedy, you'll love French and Saunders, but don't buy both collections unless you like duplicates!The French and Saunders Collections I and II both contain the same four DVDs: ""The Ingenue Years, ""Living in a Material World, ""Gentlemen Prefer French & Saunders,"" and ""At the Movies.""With Collection II you get, in addition, ""On the Rocks"" and ""Back with a Vengence.""Hope this saves you time and disappointment."
5,Funny...funny...funny,6 discs of some of the funniest French and Saunders sketches! A must for anyone who loves movie and TV parodies.
3,"okay-not as funny as ""Vicar of ...""",no no no nono no no no no no no no no no don't make me say more just take the review
4,These are fun short clips,"I enjoy these short clips, but some more than others of course. There is never a dull moment with these two gals though. We love going to sleep watching any Brit-com, and these are fun. Nothing spectacular in any of them so far (not through the whole series yet)but enjoyable."
4,Great product,"I love the comedy of French and Saunders and was happy to see this set being offered for sale. Although I am content with my purchase, I wish the full seasons/series would've been sold vice these edited versions."
2,This book is not that great.,"The recipes in this book are not organized to be very user-friendly. For example, for the Sweet and Spicy Cherry Ribs recipe, you have flip to one page for the overall recipe, then another page for the mop, then another page for rub, then another page for the sauce (which requires you to make a different rub to complete the sauce). My book has little post-it tabs all over the place just so I can keep track!Plus there's not a picture in site, and some of the ingredients are weird and hard to find.Compared to some of the other barbecue books out there, this one was pretty average. Not terrible, but average."
5,smokology,gave this gift to husband. Great book for references and recipes. He is using this book on weekly basis. Good Find.
3,Backyard BBQ:,I did not think this book should or been sold as new.It had a black spot on the outer side pages.I was giving this book as a gift and did not have time to send it back.
2,Very Basic,This book was just ok. Very basic and nothing that you couldn't get off the internet. Not recommended. Much better books out there.
4,Backyard BBQ,"This book is great, epecially if you had no idea about how to smoke meat. I am a novice, just got my electric smoker and even though this book does not deal specificaly with electric smokers it is a perfect tool."
4,"Straight forward, clear information","Chef Richard McPeake does a fine job in presenting information in a logical way. He includes equipment, techniques, ingredients and finally recipes. His experience as an award-winning bbq chef really comes through in his explanations of how to create a bark and smoke rings. An excellent resource that I'll be using for years to come."
4,A Quality Book!,This book is a super reference book to have on your shelf...the recipes have been terrific across the board...I even e-mailed the author and he answered back with advice...it's a BBQ book to buy and there's not many I'd say that about...enjoy!
3,Great Book for Reference but the typos/errors are INFURIATING!,"My mother bought my husband & I a smoker for Christmas so as an added gift, she purchased a couple of books on smoking. This book has some really great information that the other book didn't even compare too. However, some of the recipes seemed incomplete, there were recommended ingredients that weren't referenced in the book & google couldn't even find like ""Pick a Pepper"" Sauce?? There was a recipe for Dr Pepper Sauce, is that the same thing.I consider myself to be a pretty good cook & have improvised with success on many occasions. But, having to run to the internet to look stuff up to complete the recipe gets frustrating after a few times. If it didn't have such good info in it, I would be tempted to mark all the errors & mail the book back to the author!"
3,An interesting read,"The book Backyard Barbeque: The Art of Smokology -- was somewhat helpful and probably a great book for those meat lovers who are REALLY into this kind of cooking. It was worth the price I paid however, just to get some information about timing smoked meats."
4,Backyard smoker,Read and utilized the Turkey smoking recipe and it was awesome.I would recommend this book to anyone.
3,Good stuff,"The book anit too bad, the instructional content is for the most part common sense. For those with no clue on smoking this is an excellent place to start, no question.The recipes look great and this is a good resource for ideas.Realistically this book could have been half the size. Lots of blank pages, double spacing and very short pages made me feel kind of jipped. Hence 3 stars, if it was priced correctly ($9.00+ -) 4 stars."
4,A good companion book to Myron's book.,The more scientific variant on how to BBQ and why the methods should be followed. Really good reference for the novice cook and BBQ enthusiast.
2,Not smokin',"This is a BBQ cookbook not a book teaching the essentials of smoking, how to regulate the heat most specificaly"
2,Limited Value,"While some information contained in this book is correct and some of the smoking techniques are legitimate, there is a lot of information that is simply factually incorrect and will provide the novice with inferior results. No matter what is implied in the title or by other reviews, there are no ""secrets"" that you will find in this very limited cookbook. It is, at best, a short cookbook with a few recipes that might be worth trying, but the price point for such limited information is way too high. Save yourself some money and do 10 minutes of online research under ""smoking recipes"" or ""smoking techniques""; you'll learn way more and get much better results."
3,Gift for Father in Law,"We recently bought my father in law a smoker for Christmas. As no one in the family knows what they are doing, I bought this book to accompany his gift. It was the best idea ever!"
5,Best Book on Meat Smoking Ever,This is by far the best book for the novice and experienced smoke chef ever as far as I'm concerned. It gives a lot of tips and recipes for about anything you would ever think of putting in a smoker. It is an easy read with lot of information.
3,Backyard BBQ: The Art of Smokology,Lots of bbq recipes. Some comments by the author contradict his recipes.Don't use garlic salt or onion salt and then have a recipe with both in it!But mostly lots of good stuff. It's up to you to sort out and modify what you want to use in your QUE.
5,If you've never smoked . . . .,... this book provides the essential information to get you started in the right direction.It also gives good ideas (if you have any imagination at all) on what to try.
5,Excellent Guide!,"I got a horizontal smoker as a wedding gift and needed some guide to get me started. This book is perfect for just that! The first few chapters are a great intro to the methods and reasons for smokings, definitions and terminology, what you want to look for, how to achieve it, and common mistakes. There are also some great recipes and methods for cooking all sorts of meats, as well as recipes for bbq sauces, marinades, brines, mops, etc. What I like the most is that the book explains things so that you can create your own recipes. It will tell you the basics of how to balances your salts and spices, etc. and tell you the reasons for cooking a certain way. After that, it leaves it open for you to create beyond the book. Again, great step-by-step directions AND a general guide for your own creation. It has been my smoking/bbq bible. Highly recommended!"
1,Very Misleading ...,"I saw this and thought Polar Bear (with Eric Avery) had finally recorded a new album especially since it said, ""Buy this album (Held on the Tips of Fingers) with Why Something Instead of Nothing ~ Polar Bear today! "" The price was rather expensive though but I did consider. The album WSIN is great by the way for an interesting alternative / experimental rock album. Amazon.com should really not pair these two albums just based on the band names."
5,Hose Spray Nozzle,"Excellent product...could not find ANYWHERE ELSE! Thank you so much for prompt shipment and excellent product, at a great price..."
4,My 4 y-o can't get enough Dot-Art!,"We started with Dot-Art when my daughter was just three and now, at four, she continues to love the dot-art books. She will sit at her art table and create dot-art for 45 min. time periods. I will say that these books aren't totally necessary to play with the dot ink but if you know your child already loves dot ink, the she will likely love the books. They are a little on the pricey side for something that is like a coloring book, but if you keep an eye they go on promotion and are worth the money. I'd love to see more designs...we went through all of the offered books in two months."
4,ABC--123,"I really don't know much about this product and hope to learn more after Christmas. It looks to me that this is an educational product. I rated this high because I think this is probably a very interesting product. It teaches colors, numbers and letters. Also how to follow directions. I probably rated this a little lower then I should have, but if I knew more about the product I would probably rate it higher."
3,Busch a better playright than novelist,"Don't get me wrong--this was a fun read from start to finish--but it was obviously barely-disguised biography and not nearly as entertaining as its situations would suggest.One reader compares this to ""Blue Heaven,"" and yes, the tone is similar, but the accomplishment is much, much smaller. It's a fun read, a light read, but not a brilliantly-written read (whereas ""Blue Heaven"" makes one want to read out each sentence, the prose is so good), and the engaging plot is also not nearly as wire-tight as Keenan's.I hope for future books from Mr. Busch, though--now that he's got his autobiography out of his system, we can see what he accomplishes with his imagination set on full tilt.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."
4,Theatrical!,"The book is a detailed and humourous account of how Mr. Busch created his theatre company and wrote his plays. Especially worth reading if you're interested in Charles Busch, in theatre, in drag, in New York's East Village, or in gay artists."
1,Shoddy workmanship,"Both the jacket and pants in this costume were unhemmed. I can understand the pants (although this was not mentioned in the description prior to purchase), but why the jacket? Also, the gold fringe on the jacket epaulets and on the sash was not attached securely and quickly unravelled. I had to spend another $10 for a seamstress to fix the costume."
2,Camera not working!,"The cell phone itself it is excellent but unfortunately, the camera simply does not work. I will have to pay for some SE service to repair it. Low quality control from the seller."
2,Not What I Expected,"The fragrance does not last for any real length of time, so I have decided not to purchase ever again."
2,Disappointed by Kindle version,"Amazon and/or the publishers of books with diagrams need to do something about the problem of diagrams showing up fuzzy and not enlarge-able on Kindle (you can only enlarge text). I bought this book on Kindle and was unable to study the important diagrams so bought the paper version also. There is no way to return the Kindle book so basically one feels cheated. Content of book so far looks good - but don't buy the Kindle edition, until they upgrade the technology. Or there should be some discount for people buying both, etc."
5,Earth Science,"My son's backpack was stolen at school and, of course, his science book was in it. The school wanted $60 to replace it! I found this on Amazon for $40 less! It was delivered within a week! Perfect!"
2,Not as funny as I'd hoped,"I was disappointed with this book. It just didn't strike me as being that funny. The jokes are fairly predictable, and it doesn't hold as much appeal as the Worst-Case Scenario book. I had thought I'd enjoy it as I've always been a big fan of Tierney's columns in the New York Times, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,This book is a parody to itself.,"I was not expecting this book to be nearly as funny as the Worst Case Scenario series, but even with low expectations, this book left me completely underwhelmed. If you've read the WCS books, don't buy this one, its not even remotely amusing. The scenarios are interesting to imagine, but the ""tips"" this guy gives do not have the same ""over the top"" humor that the WCS books have. In fact, the introduction says ""open the book to any page and you will find it so funny you will buy the book."" Not true at all.One of the things that made the WCS books great is the illustrations. This book features an old balding guy in every illustration (is he supposed to be the author?).I only purchased this book because an Amazon 3rd party seller had it for 70 cents, which still seems like a rip off to me."
1,A one-note joke that goes on too long,"Attempting to ride the coattails of the hilarious and brilliant Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbooks, this book should have been a magazine article at the very most. Buy it only if you want to kill ten minutes in the bathroom--otherwise, wait until it hits the remainder tables next year."
1,NOT BY BUCKLEY,"The ads make you think its by Tierney and Buckley. But Buckley only wrote the intoduction. A satire on a satire almost never works. I guess SOUTHERN'S CANDY on VOLTAIRE'S CANDIDE is an exception. But Tierney ain't no Southern, in fact he is no Chris Buckley. Read Buckley's NO WAY TO TREAT A FIRST LADY or THANK YOU FOR SMOKING , but don't buy this boring, laughless book ,READ only the front cover which gives the best advice and is the only funny part.(You can click on the cover and enlarge it and read it on the internet.)"
5,BEST EVER,I love this book. I have several resource books for craft ideas for my preschool Sunday school class but this is by far my very favroite. I wish Nancy had many other books just like this!!
3,It's Okay,"The ring was a little bigger in heigth than I thought it was going to be. It would look better if the you have longer fingers. The spinners works very well, spins freely without effort."
4,Great Ring,"This is a great ring- well at least according to my husband. We got married in September and he absolutely LOVES this ringIt is tough, durable- and very wide- which is a problem if you have small fingers.He loves spinning it which annoys the heck out of me- but it looks great on himPros:Cheap Price (was a last minute ring purchase)Durable MaterialCons:Packaging lacks desire (just sent in a tiny ziplock bag)The spinning sound is very annoying--Overall, great ring at a great price and makes a good wedding band if you have large fingers."
4,Great Ring,I loved this ring especially because I'm a fidgeter and I already spin my rings. I could spin this one without being so obvious! :) The only problem I had was that it was about 1/2 size too big. Will probably order a smaller size! Highly recommend seller - very fast service!
2,Junk.,"Obviously you shouldn't expect a whole lot for under $10, but if it's going to be junk, why even sell it? You have to force the ring to spin and the edges seem kind of rough so the cut into your fingers. Lesson learned, if the price seems to good to be true, it usually is."
3,Your illustrated guide to breads,"This book is a treasure not only for its recipes but more for its photographs. There are plenty of bread books on the market, but there are hardly any that will show readers what the bread looks like.While this book doesn't have a photograph for all the breads mentioned, it has a very good description of almost all the breads you could ever come across. The book is divided into sections like ""Breads from the Americas,"" and ""Breads from Europe.""Of course there are recipes too, mostly for the more popular breads from each continent like crusty country breads, buttery challahs and brioches, and flat breads from the Orient.I bake a lot of bread and this book is the first one I reach for when I want to know what the bread looks like. Once that's done, I'm on the way to baking up a good loaf or braid or roll or..."
2,"OK I guess, but leave out the silly voices","This ""game"" is simply a point at the monster and click and click until he is dead. I custom created the characters but played the actual game for all but 30 minutes and yawned and went to bed. Bor ing. The voices were stupid and not funny at a all. I personally think they should have been left out! They completely ruined the game for me. Dwarves don't sound like teenagers, and that's what the voices were, just like Might and Magic VI+. Get some serious actors in there or don't even bother putting voices in at all!As for the interface, it was tedious and could only be controlled with the mouse, no hotkeys. You click on an envelope and out comes a smiling face saying ""let's get dangerous"" or ""I'm yer worst nightmare.."" something equally stupid. You then deside wheather you want to attack with sword, gun or magic then click on the monster. What a teenage concept, I think I'll stick with the classic games. Dark Savant, Bane, ect."
1,Bewildered,"I have no idea why this game is so highly recommended by so many.The graphics are dated,and I can't imagine why directx 8 is needed for this game.I tried very hard to enjoy it but I can't see what's there that's new or different.I hate the interface,and have found no way to see your stack or even your own character.In a first person view you should be able to see your other party members,decide who you like ,check out their skills and move them around in position,but not possible in this world.I haven't played the previous Wizadry games,and maybe if I had and come along with the story as computer technology progressed,I might find it more interesting,but I don't really think so.If you are looking for fast paced action,great graphics,and an engrossing story Don't look here.All in all, Wizardy 8's only wizardry seems to have been in the pr.1 star"
1,Weak,"I guess if you spent the eighties playing Wizardry this game really does it for you. For the rest of us it just doesn't cut it. The graphics are straight out of 1992 and the control options are sad. You're forced to pivot your POV around with keyboard keys like a tank turret which completely kills any feeling of suspense. The character development within your party looked promising, but that's not enough to cary the dated game play. I can't believe companies make games like this and put them on shelves next to modern titles and expect to make money."
1,"CD 2 is damaged, and i am trying to get a replacement","i purchased with the intention of installing after i finished other games i had, thus i let my 30 day return policy expire, then when i tried to install the game the installation crashes at 99% right before finishing!! it killed me! i dont want to return it but maybe someone out there can tell me who to contact to get CD 2 replaced since it seems to be the one with the problem....any takers??"
3,Would have been Perfect 7 years ago,"I think Wiz 8 is a good game IF you are a fan of the Wiz series and have played the other games. If you are new, you will indeed, not get what all the fuss is about.I can understand that it would be hard to jump into Wiz 8 and be excited by it. It does, on the surface, interact a whole lot like M&M. The graphics are OK, but nothing special or new. The story line is OK, but you appreciate it much more if you played Bane, Savant...etc.This game will be loved by Wiz fans, like me, that waited years for the next (and sadly final) chapter in this series. But, if you are new to the Wizardry story line, weren't even alive when Wiz I came out, or think that games like Final Fantasy are examples of an RPG....you are too young and spoiled by technological advances to appreciate this game and the rest of us are too old and reflected to see its flaws."
1,Irritating,"As a reader of regency romances for more than 25 years, I have to say that this is one of the worst I've read. While I did finish it just to satisfy my curiosity to see if I had guessed correctly as to the villain (and I had), it was painful and I would recommend that all lovers of the genre stand clear. The story was predictable, the dialogue repetitive, and the heroine irritating beyond belief. She annoyed me from the get-go and I was hoping that she would die a horrible death just so I could be rid of her."
2,paused in middle of game,paused in middle of game had to restart game a few times but still pauses from time to time
2,This is a joke...,Ok not only is the movie bad but the game is too. I gave this game a try anyhow to see what it would be like..It looked like a promesing game but it fails.The graphics are pretty good which earns the 2 stars but the game ultimatley fails. The controls are bad...Really bad. The game had some pretty stupid fights and a really stupid plot.To make this short and sweet the game was bad. The controls were wierd and the game is a bit glitchy....a bit too glitchy. It goes like thisBad controlspretty shortStupid storyBad fightingBad everything!!! I know I know it's based on a movie it's not suppose to have a grrreat story line but this was pathetic. I had a better time playing the Hulk game this this garbage! Don't get this game! I rank it with all the other oh-so bad games such asSpawn the EternalFight ClubAquamanDrakeDo not get this game..2.0 out of 5 stars....Terrible game..
1,OH MY GOSH,"This Game absolutly sucks to the max the movie sucks how can the game posibly be any better sure the graphics are good but it sucks just as Aqua-man and super man geez katamari damacy is better than that if you want an good game get Halo 2 , Doom 3 or splinter cell chaos theory or at least get spiderman 2 the best marvel game out there you can explore new york and the fighting and controls are good. since the scale doesnt have a zero give this game a 1 out of 5"
4,Good,"Good sound quality, takes little space, and looks cool. The only downside is that it doesn't come with the remote."
4,Worth The Price,"I bought this docking station at a local store, one of the reasons being the color. I got it home and it was very easy to use and set up, but I did throw away the covers for the charger, they won't work with the case I have on my ipod nano. I like this docking station because the sound is very clear and it was easy to use, I love the dimmer on it so I can choose to have a little light on if I want it. I do agree with someone else's review that the lowest setting when the ipod is playing is a little loud to my liking. I wanted to be able to have just a little sound when I go to sleep but that first setting is too much, I wish there would have been a setting with about half that volume. All in all I like this docking station and i'm happy with it. By the way I love the switch for day light savings time so I don't have to mess with the clock, just move the switch and it adjusts the hour."
2,"Easy to use, but performance is awful","I bought this looking for an alarm that would let me charge my iPod and wake up to music. It appeared great at first-- I found the buttons and settings very easy to use after skimming thru the manual.But within the first month the sound utterly failed and it would crackly constantly while playing the iPod for more than a few seconds on the alarm feature. Within 5 months, the dimmer/snooze stopped working and it stopped charging the iPod. The clock function is all that remains at this point, so I am getting rid of it and looking for another brand."
3,Great for travelling with little kids,"This is a great unit for traveling with little kids. It's got a nightlight, and sounds good enough at low volume for the essential bedtime music routine. The triangular form factor means stability when you turn it sideways w/ an ipod touch / iphone for playing a movie.Will it rock your hotel room? No. But it will improve the hotel room's atmosphere, even with the mono sound. Packs easily."
2,Not what i hoped for,"The screen on this thing is sooooo bright. I can't sleep unless I turn the screen completely off, but I don't like doing that."
5,Great BUY!!!!,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loooves it. It is great just to play music but even more it helps wake him up to something he likes in the morning!!! I highly recommend this!!!iHome iH4B Alarm Clock for with Dock for iPod (Black)
1,Did not work- had to return!!,I bought this for my sister as a Christmas present. It worked for 2 hours and then would not work after that. We did everything all over again (from the instructions) on how to reset the docking station. It wouldn't even turn back on. Very disappointed in this product- would not recommend it at all!!
3,"I've bought the iHome Alarm Clock before, which is good as the seller did not deliver","In fact, they cancelled the order without notification. When I called to find out what was up, they kept me on hold for 15 minutes and finally said that the order was cancelled and that I'd get a refund. I asked why and they kept me on hold another 10 minutes before telling me that they didn't have it.Who was this seller? J&R; Music Computer World, who I have bought from before and been satisfied. Oh well.The actual iHome clock is an excellent product which works well as a limited-space docking station and way to listen to your Ipod. Not big sound, but perfect for an office at home or work where you'd like music but don't need volume. The product can get loud, but I heard a little distortion at the top end range, but that's to be expected from a single speaker dock like this."
1,Misleading Product Discription,The technical specs on this product state that it comes with a remote. It does not come with a remote. The packaging stated that a remote can be purchased for extra. Amazon needs to change their product description wording.
5,Happy with Product,I ordered this for my son for his birthday and was very pleased with the prompt delivery date. It was delivered on the date quoted and he was very happy with it.
2,Great for charging an iPod. Not so great as an alarm.,"For charging or playing my iPod nano, the iHome works just fine.My main two complaints have to do with the alarm clock function of the iHome. I have woken up late or overslept numerous times because of this alarm clock.1) The AC Power Adapter unplugs too easily. Any time I move the clock, plug disconnects even though it looks connected. The back up battery will keep the time set, but the alarm won't work.2) To turn the alarm off, the button is at the top. To snooze, the bar is on the bottom. All too often, while in just woken up ""Oh gawd, please let me have a few more minutes of sleep,"" I have reached for the snooze bar, but accidentally hit the off button because it's the first thing my hand hits while trying to find the snooze."
5,Black Alarm Clock for Ipod,"Excellent Transaction, I could not have been happier! I ordered this item kind of last minute as a birthday gift and was so impressed when it arrived in just a matter of days! I had it in time for my Grandson's birthday which made me very happy! I have not been an on line shopper for long but I have learned whenever I want something fast I will always order thru Amazon!"
5,Great docking iPod Docking station and a compact alarm,"I really like this. I wanted an alarm clock and iPod docking station, wanted them both together and I didnt want to spend a fortune. This product does everything it promises to do with a sleek pink style My wife got the Pink one.. I got the stylish Black/blue one I would recommend this product to anyone that needs to get up in the morning but wants to do it to their OWN playlist!.. two thumbs up!"
4,Very nice little Clock Radio,"I like this alarm clock for its color and space saving size. I had read other reviews on it saying you could not turn the glowing lights all the way off, but you can! I also read a review that said the ipod nano 3g does not work with it, but that is the ipod I have and it works great! The sound is great and I love waking up to my favorite songs on my ipod! The only down side for me was there was no remote with it and that you had to buy the remote separately. Although, I was able to use the remote that came with my under the counter ihome to change the volume and songs on the alarm clock. I think this a great product for the price!"
3,Doubles as a nightlight.,"Product appears to be of good quality. I wish I had known that the time-display isn't illuminated seperately from the ""side lights"". Lights have (3) brightness levels, but if they're turned off there's no backlight for the LCD readout."
3,Bright pink side lights,It's great for the price and I thought the sound quality was fine. The decorative pink side ights are very (very) bright. It lights up the entire room at night. I had to turn it to the wall so I could sleep. I was looking for an inexpensive yet attractive way to keep my ipod charged.
4,ihome,the product came very quickly and works great. its very loud for its small size and is such an easy way to recharge my ipod
5,Love it!,The iHome iH4B is most incredible. I traveled with it for the past two years and love it. Great sound out of a little bitty appliance. No complaints what so ever. Even works when it is unplugged!
1,Not worth $50,"Poor sound quality. Does not come with docking adapters for all ipods, this should be standard when selling a product like this, it's a 5 cent piece of plastic. Buttons on top are flat so hard to reach from bed and know what you are doing."
1,Not worth your money,This product was definately not worth my money. The light is way to bright to fall asleep with it on. The input that connects the power cord to the dock is too big so that i have to tape the cord into the dock and any movement of that spot will reset the time and is extremely annoying to deal with
2,Worst Alarm I've Owned,"I got this clock as a replacement for one that broke to keep in my dorm. I get angry at it almost every day and can't wait to get a new one. If it picks up Wifi signal, it will randomly turn on the Sleep mode and music will start blaring- day or night- or it will turn off the unit while you are listening to your iPod, even if the iPod is still playing. It also messes with the brightness of the light. I called the manufacturer and their only advice was to move the unit further from the source of the Wifi, which I can't really do in a dorm room. Many mornings (once or twice a week), the alarm will not go off even though it was set, so I end up being late for class. Also, even the lowest sound setting is really too loud for me.Spend your money on something else!"
3,"Good speaker, bad alarm","This iHome has awesome sound considering the size. All my other iPod speakers have sounded kind of fuzzy, but this one was crystal clear. The triangular shape is convenient, not only because it fits in corners but also because you can lie it on its side to watch movies.However, it's not really worth buying as an alarm. If you want to fall asleep to it, the lowest volume is really loud. And in the mornings, it just plays whatever playlist you were listening to when you last used it, at least for me.Bottome line: Good iPod speaker, but not a great alarm."
2,Second one of these already in 6 months,"Bought this a while back, and at first, we pulled it out and plugged the ipod in, and wouldn't you know, it didn't play the ipod music. But i assure you, the ipod was connected, as it charged the ipod. And the lights didn't even work. We sent it back, if i can remember we had to pay for shipping too, though it was at ihome's fault for a defective product. Got the second one, ipod music played fine, BUT the clock was out of whack. Now when it is like 10:48 or something, the clock says 10:78. Don't want to send it back, it'd be a waste of time, and maybe money, so we can live with extra minutes in an hour, i guess. overall, functioning at the least, and a plasticy feel/look."
5,Nice and Simple,"Works just fine. Nano docks easily. Light works well, and is not too bright, like I read before I bought it. Speakers are loud enough to sound perfect over the noise of a fan at night, while playing sleep music. Easy to set the time, and click one button for Daylight Savings Time. Light enough, and small enough to travel with."
3,not too bad,"Very easy to use and the sound is pretty decent as well. I use mine a lot and I've noticed some ""white noise"" in the background when playing certain tracks and not others. Thats really my only complaint with this product so far."
2,Many Poor Design Decisions,"1) The iPod Mini will not connect as long as the adapter is installed. Instead, I need to remove the adapter and let it wobble there on the top. 2) There is no way to push the side buttons without first feeling for the correct button, then gripping the entire unit. Pressing the buttons without full grip only pushes the iH4 to the side.3)Gives the impression that it includes the remote, but doesn't.4) The display is too bright and sports high intensity LEDs to add to the illumination.5) Sleep (the best feature of iHome units) is a small button rather than a large bar like snooze."
4,better volume control would give it 5 stars,"i DO like this product. for the price, it's a great little product. i do wish that it had better volume control. even if you set both the clock AND your i-pod to the lowest volume, it's a little louder than what i would like. but it's not bad. i also like the fact that i have a docking station to charge my i-pod, instead of having to plug it in somewhere. very convenient. and i like the pink light too. what can i say, i'm a girl."
1,Ipod Touch Users Beware!!,"I received an IH4 for my birthday with an Ipod Touch. When using the IH4 with an ipod touch there is a high level of static coming from the dock's speaker. I returned it to the store thinking something was wrong. I got a second one and have the same problem. I called I Home and the technician said that they are aware of the problem and there is nothing that they can do. Beware when purchasing if you have a touch!! This faulty dock is not worth the 50 dollars. If it wasn't a gift, i would most certainly demand my money back. I am never buying an I-home product again. It is pretty lame when a company recognizes a fault in the product and continues to sell it."
2,Wear sunglasses at night,"Seemed like a good idea to wake up to my iPod. The problem was that the backlighting and sidebar lights on this clock are so bright that it practically lit up the whole room, even at its lowest setting. I had to put electrical tape over the sidebar lights to make it somewhat bearable at night. However, the backlighting of the digital time display was still too bright to leave on at night, so I turned that off. Problem is, if you wake up at night and want to see what time it is you have to hit a button to backlight the digital display and when I did I was practically blinded by the brightness. I returned it within a week."
3,OK iPod dock - bad alarm clock,The item works ok.I have 2 main complaints.The light is too bright even when dimmed illuminate the whole room at night.The lowest possible volume is too loud (ok I am sensitive!) ..The combination of these 2 factors make this not extremely pleasant to have in my bedroom
1,backlight STILL too bright & music too loud for sleeping,"I thought I would love this little alarm clock but after much time and use...it just doesn't cut it. There are 3 settings for the backlight but still the lowest one is way too bright for sleeping comfortably. Additionally, I enjoy falling asleep to music and volume setting ""1"" - the lowest is WAY too loud for dozing off. Who in the heck engineered this thing? It's terrible!!"
3,Disappointment,Did not come with a remote control. The box states that a remote control was included but there was none present. What a disappointmant for my grandaughter when she opened it and couldn't set the clock!!!My email to the site recommended by Amazon has not resulted in a reply to date. So much for ordering on line from Amazon!!!Betty Hobson
4,A nice clean design,"I searched high and low for a good ihome and finally found one. It's the perfect size to put on a desk. I have it in my dorm room and people are always commenting on it. The volume level is good and it does not over charge your ipod. The only thing I don't like is the bright light; I like to sleep in complete darkness. I'm glad it can be adjusted or turned off. Over all, this is a good product and not big and bulky like those $100 ihomes."
2,Quality problems,"Gave this to my wife 3 years ago. During that time it has had two major issues.1. The iPod dock went out for a few months and then came back. During that time the clock unit would not detect the iPod, and therefore we couldn't use it for music.2. Recently the back-light on the clock went out making the clock unreadable. I've never had the display die on an alarm clock.Will not buy another iHome product due to the quality issues."
1,Landing Lights...,Oh my in the dark the only way to see the clock it hit the light/snooze button and if you live anywhere near an air port well then look out...When the alarm goes off all the lights come on plus the IPod comes on and if you are turned that way once you recover from being blinded you are able to hit the snooze...I took mine back to the store. I was not happy about the remote costing another $15 either.
2,Could not get the IH4 alarm to wake us to music using iPod Nano 3rd Generation,"We have a brand new iPod Nano 3rd generation and purchased the IH4 as an alarm clock. We promptly returned it because the unit did NOT play music from the iPod in alarm mode. We could only get it to beep. I followed the instructions very carefully, reset the iPod and downloaded the most current version of iTunes. I also visited iHome's website for tech assistance, but there is no on-line support for the IH4. As an alternative, we purchased the IH8 which works with the 3rd gen Nano."
1,poor quality,I returned the iHome alarm clock for a refund because after 2 days of use the speakers started buzzing loudly. I also shared a concern noted by other reviewers that the lowest volume setting was too loud. Much too loud to fall asleep to.
2,Does not come with 4G insert!,"My daughter initially liked the looks of this before trying to set it up. We are very disappointed that it does not come with the 4G insert. The description says that it works with the 4G, but now we find out it doesn't unless we buy a separate insert. We are deciding whether to return it or not."
3,WAS great,"Ive had this alarm clock for years, but as time as gone, the alarm clock has just stopped. It randomly decides when it wants to work and when it doesnt. buygin a new one now. The sound system is great though."
5,I found a replace power for my IH4B on powerpayless.com,"The AC adpater failed more than one year after buying.I found a full equivalent AC adpater to the IAD25b on [...]It works fine, it was shipped & delivered from California to France very quickly, and the web site has a French language option.I'm a happy customer :-)"
1,Worst Alarm clock in recorded history...,"...and if you used this alarm clock you most likely slept through it (recorded history). It has a ""volume"" feature where 0 has no sound and 1-14 all sound pretty much the same in volume. I have never been so let down by anything other than Starwars Episode one...but it would be a close tie. It is very random on deciding when and if to allow Ipod control via its buttons, its alarm just decided it would work when and if it wanted to...and it has kept time worse than any other clock I have ever had. I am not sure if I could ever trust Ihome again because this is a horrid horrid horrid clock."
4,IHome alarm clock iPad .,"I love this device. I needed some music before going to sleep and this has a 90, 60. 30 minute option. My favorite function is being able to set the alarm, snooze or just turn it off. By turning the alarm off, it automatically resets the alarm for the next day. No worrying about 'did turn the alarm on'I found it very easy to use, I do like the ability to change the 'night light' setting to 3 different intensities.The sound is not the greatest but I am able to enjoy listening to music on one floor of the house.I am reviewing the black model. I also want to note that I bought this item at our local TJMAXX for16.99+ tax.Peace to all."
3,iHome Ih4P,Sound quality of the unit is just OK. I bought it for my 10 year old so for now it's OK but would upgrade as she gets older.
4,A nice summary,"I had the pleasure of attending the 2009 Tattoo, and I feel this DVD is an excellent summary of the program. A longer DVD (maybe a set?) with the entire production would be great."
2,Great Colors - Lacking Quality,The comforter set LOOKS great but when you make the bed the material inside the comforter is not attached to the outside of the comforter - thus creating lumps everywhere. It takes me a while to make the bed so that the comforter does not have lumps - lots of adjusting the outer part of the comforter - don't buy it!!!!!!
4,Game is very challening for my childrens mind.,"This game is an old one, but my kids enjoy playing it all the time after school. It's a challenge to their mind. Thanks."
2,"Serrations great for tomatos, but that's it","I bought this to have a very sharp small kitchen knife. I figured that the serrations wouldn't hurt, and would definitely add value with regard to slicing tomatoes. OOPS!The serrations make slicing tomatoes, especially thin skinned very ripe ones, a breeze. Unfortunately, they ""catch"" on other food actually increasing the work needed to cut. Needless to say, I suppose, is that the stroke used with this knife is a pull (it will not work with a ""pressing"" action), but for some reason a push stroke doesn't seem as effective.Also note that this knife is physically light weight (good for some, less good for others).I looked at the recommendations for this knife, and some of them seem to be for Kyocera ceramic knives in general, not this specific 5"" serrated knife. Do yourself a favor; if you are just purchasing a small sharp kitchen knife, try the regular blade. If you know that you want the serrations, then this knife will be for you."
2,"Too brittle, don't want to worrk about eating chunks of ceramic","When it was working, it was great and never had any problems slicing through any tomato. Unfortunately I feel the ceramic is too brittle. I was using it to slice a guava yesterday and midway through finishing it I noticed a chunk missing off the middle of the edge. This pretty much means I probably swallowed a small chunk of ceramic. It must have broken off when it contacted one of the seeds. If I have to constantly worry about whether or not I can use this knife for this or that task because something may be too hard, it's just not worth it. I've been using steel for ages and have never encountered this problem before. I'll just stick to steel from now on thanks."
4,Awesome Knife!,"SO damned sharp and the perfect size for general use. I own two of these and bought one for my mom, who LOVES hers as well. Only problem with the ceramic knives is they chip pretty easily, so you need to take special care when storing Still one of my favs. Shipped fast and a good price."
2,The Hugh Hefner of Automobiles,Davis is the automotive version of Hugh Hefner. His hedonism just focuses on cars instead of women. Reading his old columns is like reading Hefner's old Playboy Philosophy columns. Both perspectives are equally pretentious and equally obsolete.Both of the magazines that Davis has been deeply involved with have degenerated into PR organs for the auto manufacturers. I don't know if Playboy has fared any better.
1,Preposterously Egotistical,"Here is one of the biggest egos on the planet. ""Thus Spake David E.,"" indeed! Jeez, have at it if you're a fan. If not, steer clear: the columns are less about cars and more about The Man freeloading his way around the world, eating well and snuggling up to anyone who might advance his notoriety. Besides, he didn't write a ""book""; he just reprinted columns from his years at ""Car and Driver"" and ""Automobile."""
1,Microsoft Licensing Problem,"It's a shame Microsoft doesn't trust it's customers. This product requires one to eMail, call, or connect to Microsoft through the Internet to register. If you don't, you can't use the product after starting it 49 more times. If that's not bad enough, I wasn't able to register this product because the software key was outside the range Microsoft had in their database and because ""I purchased it through an Internet store"" (I purchased it from Amazon), they refused to assist me in any way. This is a new directive from Microsoft I confirmed after escillation. Apparently Microsoft doesn't trust any internet store as well as it's customers."
1,Needs Patching,"Helps get projects moving, a great piece of software until around the 50th time you run it when it shuts down. I cant find any patches to repair this problem."
3,God or no God - a billion to one odds either way!,I found it interesting but understandable that the other two reviewers were at such odds. Its so typical of any subject combining both religion and science.The book is a worth while read just to get an interesting point of view regarding one angle on the myriad ideas regarding the mess science and religion have on logical thought.Foster does a great disservice though. At every major point he attempts to make (and throughout the book) he makes huge and bald faced assumptions that point only in a specific direction to support his idea.Tha mathmatical arguement is worth the read but its a very unemotional book and is typically abrupt and too concise in its arguements. If the subject doesn't interest you pass it by.
1,Foster just isn;t very intelligent,"Sorry to disapoint the creationists, but your poster boy, Foster, misses just about every mark. Foster is no scientist, in fact he is an embaressment to science."
2,"Book fine, CD bad","Luckily I had ordered this item just for the included book since the CD did not work (scratchy, poor sound). I already had another CD so just combined the book with it for useful language training."
2,An important piece of cinematic history even if it isn't very good.,"This fish-out-of-water (cactus-out-of-desert?) film is notable primarily as the first pairing of Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegel, who would collaborate three years later on the seminalDirty Harry. Coogan's Bluff therefore acts as a cinematic link between the two critical phases of Clint's career: the spaghetti westerns of the 1960s and the police procedurals of the 1970s.On its own merits, however, this film falters. Uneven and bizarre, with an uneven and bizarre supporting cast, Coogan's Bluff is not worth watching twice. The dialogue is stilted and so is the romantic liaison. The lone cop motif is available elsewhere at higher entertainment value. For example, 1983'sLone Wolf McQuadestarring Chuck Norris. If you are committed to watching a detective drama from 1968, you need look no further thanBullitt.Caught this ON DEMAND, so cannot speak to the merits of the fairly old (2004) DVD release."
2,Very Disappointed,"I've been using Schaum Outlines since the early '50s. This one is by far the most confusing that I've ever seen. It should be entitled Advance Chinese Vocabulary. The first lesson uses vocabulary that pre-supposes prior knowledge of Chinese grammar and vocabulary. Overall, the appendices are the only useful items (for a beginning learner). I would return it, but I hope that some far off day I will be able to understand the first sentence on the first page."
2,Please consider including both the traditional form and the simplified one as well,"Schaum's Outline of Chinese Grammar chose to include both the traditional form and the simplified form in the book. I really think that's a very smart and considerate decision. For people who want to learn the Chinese characters, you need to get familiar with both forms. If you're taught only in simplified form, you're missing a lot -- especially the beauty of the Chinese characters. I strongly recommend that Schaum list both forms like you did with the grammar book. Besides, I guarantee that if you make this small change, the book will sell better. Otherwise, I won't buy it."
3,"Lots of vocabulary, but presentation could be better","This book presents lots of useful vocabulary, often with a helpful sketch. For example the At the Hotel chapter shows a picture of the room and bathroom, with callouts for the Chinese words for the bed, sink, shower, etc. in characters and pinyin.Sample dialogs are presented to demonstrate the use of the vocabulary. However, the presentation could be improved simply by using the form in the Schaum's Chinese Grammar book, where every sentence if provided in traditional and simplified characters, pinyin, and English. Instead, the Vocabulary book usually gives the English for only one word in the sentence. That's fine if you already have a working knowledge of Chinese, but for beginner's it would be nicer to have a translation of the whole sentence."
5,A Great Book!,"My son has loved this book, and it was the first book he asked for. The illustrations are bright, colourful, and happy! It is the perfect size for little hands."
5,Wonderful Collection,"A great collection -- for Vocal, Piano and Guitar. 43 songs with lyrics and guitar chords/diagrams. Includes brief comments by the B-G's on each song. Contains: Alive, Bodyguard, Boogie Child, Come on Over, Edge of the Universe, Fanny (Be Tender with My Love), First of May, He's a Liar, Holiday, How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, How Deep is Your Love, I Started a Joke, I Can't See Nobody, I've Gotta Get a Message to You, If I Can't Have You, Jive Talkin', Jumbo, Living Eyes, Lonely Days, Love You Inside Out, Love So Right, Massachusetts, Melody Fair, More than a Woman, Mr. Natural, My World, New York Mining Disaster, Night Fever, Nights on Broadway, One, (Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away, Run to Me, Someone Belonging to Someone, Stayin' Alive, Throw a Penny, To Love Somebody, Too Much Heaven, Tragedy, Woman in You, World, Words, You Should be Dancing, You Stepped Into my Life.Sure wish it had more . . . ."
1,Skullcandy sucks,"I have had in a four month period two skullcandy headphones, both have died. The first pair i purchased were the Smokin' Buds. For the four month period i had them they were great. They stayed in while longboarding and skiing, they sounded great, and of course looked awesome. That is until they just quit. No excessive volume use, no heavy beatings, and they just died. Four months of medium use and their done. Skullcandy is the WORST quality headphones i have ever come across. I have never known anyone to have had a headphone form this brand last longer than a year."
2,I expected better,I got these to use with my 80 gig ipod that I got for xmas and at first they seemed okay but now they stopped working on me and I'm annoyed that I couldn't get at least three full months use out of them before they broke. I didn't tug on them or misuse them and they lasted a fraction of the time that any headphones I used when I was a kid and I was pretty hard on my headphones back then.
3,"Decent Sound Quality, Not So Decent Durability","I've had two pairs of these earbuds, one in rasta colors and one in pink, and though the sound quality is decent/good for watching movies and listening to music and they fit in my ears well and block out a lot of noise, the durability is not the best. I use these mainly on my computer and iPod, and the headphone jack on my computer is on the front, so the earbuds plug often time will be resting against my body, and within a couple of months one of the earbuds will lose sound and then the other will follow suit within a couple of weeks. I would invest a little more money and go for the Skullcandy Titans, they have better sounds quality and are tons more durable."
3,You pay for what you get.,"The one I got the wire wasn't nylon. It was a really cheap wire. It feel like I will rip it, if I get it snagged on something. The sound is okay at best, not amazing but not crappy. The soft silicone ear tips aren't soft. They are actually kind of hard and hurt sometimes. But the reason I bought these headphones was for working out and just ruining them. I paid for an average pair of earphones and that is what I got. I just wanted them to wear and not worry about breaking them since they were $20."
1,Worst quality in the world. Went through six headsets.,I am finally going to close the book on the worst set of headphones in the history of man. When they are working they are ok but they are broken most of the time. I have gone through about 6 of these things. The issues I have had are most frequently is a speaker going out (4 times) and twice I received a package with a broken headset right out of the box.I know some may say that I must have used them incorrectly but this is not true I always made sure not to wrap them (per their instructions) and this would not make a difference for the broken out of the box ones I received. I would avoid all skull candy products.This last time they broke (yet again) I sent them back under warranty and they have not sent me a new pair and honestly I am not too disappointed. good riddance!
4,Great headphones; minimal comfort,"These headphones are pretty good for the price. I love the sound quality, it's way, way better than the Apple headphone's quality. The only problem I have with them is how they fit into your ear. You basically have to push the outer part of your ear way back to make the headphones stay in place. But, once you get them in, they don't fall out... If you don't move."
1,"good sound- poor design, lasted 2 months","liked the sound- good for coffee shop studying as it blocked out other noise well.however the volume control on the chord was too bulky and acted as a weight while jogging. constantly having to put earbuds back in ears.after 2 months, the left side stopped working and only works when i hold the chord at the base at a certain angle.pay ten bucks more and get a better product."
5,Best buds for my skull,"I was finally convinced to use ear buds over ear-covering 'phones when I got a set with my Pioneer Inno. Since I wanted one pair for home and one for the office, I have been trying to find another pair I liked as well.First I decided to go with Pioneer, since I had such luck with the first set. But the buds were too big and hurt my ears. Next I tried a pair of Philips with the same results.But with these ear buds, I am happy at last. They stay in my ear, their sound is clear--take that claim with a grain of salt since I use them more for talk recordings than for music--and the in-cord volume control is more useful than I'd anticipated.I am tempted to buy more of these in other spiffy colors. But having read other reviews, I want to hang onto these for a while to see if I have a problem with their breaking within a year."
2,Not very good sound,"I didn't read through many of the previous reviews before buying these earbuds. I was looking for a mid-priced set of earbuds that have an inline volume control. These seemed to fit the bill.I got them and put them in. First off, they're very comfortable. They seal nicely and provide some very good isolation.The bad part is that they have almost no midrange. I can hear tons and tons of lower freqencies and some pretty good (not great) highs. But midrange was almost entirely missing. It makes my music sound terribly muddy and vocals are almost non-existent.I guess I'll keep looking...."
3,Bittersweet.,"I really, really liked these earbuds. Good Look, good sound, and noise cancellation.Then one day, one of the ear buds stopped working. And now I am here, looking at what you guys have to say.Bittersweet."
4,Probably the best earbuds I've had,"I picked up the rasta colored ones at my local Best Buy. The rasta color is perfect and Skullcandy is probably one of the few companies that have actually made headphones with rasta colors. I've only had them a few days and the first thing they notice is the colors. The sound of these is perfect for bass-heavy music such as reggae, hip-hop, or perhaps doom metal. I really wasn't expecting so much bass for such small earbuds and that's a good thing. They block out sound pretty good too, I would be sitting right next to my friends and not listening to my music not even that loud and I couldn't hear a word they said. The only thing that bothers me is that they don't stay in your ear well when you're moving around a lot such as when I'm skating. Still, they're definitely better than the ones that my Zune came with and they're pretty comfortable. Like I said, they're probably better than most earbuds especially for music with tons of bass."
2,SO SAD,I BOUGHT THIS AND THE RASTA STYLE SKULLCANDY HEADPHONES FOR OUR SKATEBOARDING SON FOR CHRISTMAS...BOTH HAVE ALREADY BLOWN OUT AND WE'RE ONLY IN THE 1ST OF APRIL...I'M MAKING THIS COMMENT ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THESE SKULLCANDY...I WAS DUMB AND PAYED 29.99 FOR EACH PAIR....SO SAD...
3,Suprisingly Durable,"Sound quality is pretty good, but noticed that the bass is fairly heavy. But a good sound for the price. And I'm surprised at their durability. I had these buds a week and, like an idiot, had them dangling out my car door on the drive home from the gym. 7 miles and gallons of rain later, they were pretty beat up, but after letting them dry for several days, gave off the same sound quality. They look beat up now, but they work very well."
4,Good quality.,"As expected, Skullcandy earphones are good quality for a good price. However, I'm that weird person whose ears are very small, so they don't fit properly and are uncomfortable. Otherwise, a good buy."
1,"Worst headphones ever, skullcandy's are terrible",They broke within the first two days of normal use. Poorly made and i would not suggest this to anyone.
3,Good value,"When I saw the price tag, $8.75, down from a list price of $30, I pressed the ""buy"" Button.I had been aware of Skull Candy ever since the founder was interviewed in either INC. or ENTREPRENEUR magazine. Clever concept,with all the color choices. There is an awfully wide range of prices, and therefore, sound quality.The only ones I compared them to,thus far, in a sound check, was a $2 pair of Colby's. Needless to say, these had: better clarity, a warmer and less distorted bass line. However, they do require more watts to drive than the Colby's.The rubber gaskets offer markedly more comfort than the hard plastic found in other earbuds.Can't rate durability, too new.Overall, a good value. I would consider other Skull Candy buds in the higher price range, down the road."
4,Good sound but prone to slipping out,"Sound quality is excellent and I know the headphones are very popular. My only concern is about how easily the headphones can slip out of the ear while running and exercising.Otherwise, I am very happy, especially considering how inexpensive they are."
3,"Good quality, except for life of the product","In the last year I have had 2 pairs of these headphones. The first pair lasted for 7 months before it stopped working in one ear, and the second only lasted 3 months. Luckily skullcandy offers a repair service where you send in the earphones to be repaired or get a cupon for a new pair. The sound quality and comfort are good, I just wish they would last longer under heavy use."
1,waste of money,I have given skullcandy more than enough of a chance - three chances to be exact. They are total garbage; they last only a couple of months before fraying near the plug and ceasing to work. I am so irritated and will never buy another pair of skullcandy headphones again. Spend the money and get an acceptable pair from BoseBose In-Ear Headphonesor Sony!
1,Not worth it,"I bought these earbuds despite the warning about durability. Sure enough, the left earbud stopped working within the first hour! Of course, they have a warranty - you need to email them to get a return authorization and then you have to mail them for a replacement - at your cost. Given they were inexpensive, the trouble of buying the mailing envelope, buying the postage, taking the time and the gas to mail it - making this return will cost more than the earbuds are worth. Chalk this one up to a dumb decision and time to move on to a quality product with a reliable reputation."
1,you get what you pay for.,"the etymotic silicone sleeves of these headphones at first delivered fantastic sound and real bass. while the quality was really decent. the sleeves are too soft and like to pull out easily , the cord also transmits sound like a train (running on the treadmill gave me a headache), and the white plastic gets dirty fast.if that wasnt enough to deter, ive had them for a month, and then for no reason the left earbud just ceased to work. im going to spend a little more money and get the sony mdr."
4,There good,"Sound is good and they fit in my ear nicely. Only thing I don't like is they will fall out just as easily. I have found they work best if you put them in upside down. Actually pointing the end with the wire coming out towards the front of your ear and then lay the cord between your ear and head, this holds them in nicely."
1,Terrible product from a terrible company,"Do not buy these.I bought these over a month ago and they worked alright, but about a month later the right one just stopped working out of nowhere. I didn't play music too loud so i coulden't have possile of blown it.Then i contacted the company via emails if they would send me a new pair or fix them, and I did not recieve an email still two weks later.Don't waste your money.btw the 'black' ones aren't all black. The wires are black and the cheap metal is black the rest is amber. They do not look like that picture exactly.Don't waste your money."
2,good sound break easily,It sounds so great and feels ok. It broke in about 25 days. Thats common when buying skullcandys
3,Great headphones... while it lasted,"High quality earphones with great looks and strong emphasis on bass. Unfortunately, a little short-lived for a pair of earphones that feel durable and come from a reputable audio company. Lasted just about six months until the left earbud died out and can be thrown into a rest of the pile that followed the same fate. Why can't we just have an interchangeable earbud system? I treated this pair with much greater care than my previous earphones. Even my original iPod headphones are still kicking after years of mistreatment and neglect. I will now reconsider my next Skullcandy purchase."
1,they broke after 4 minutes,I can't believe they broke after 4 minutes. I gave them as a gift for Christmas to my niece and when she took them out of her ear they came appart...just split open. They are being returned!!
4,You won't be disappointed,"These headphones were purchased to replace the uncomfortable iPod headphones. The package included 3 sets of ear pieces for different sized ears. Not only are they comfortable to wear but they out performed the original headphones with ease. There is also an inline volume control which is nice to use so you do not have to unlock your screen to adjust the volume. The only con is the size of the wires, I feel like they could have used a little larger size to allow for normal wear/tear. If they do happen to break I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another set to replace them."
1,TOTAL JUNK!!!!!!!,"These are the worst headphones sold. Please dont waste your money on these. I had an older set that were great, they changed them to this horrible style. Pitiful design. How the heck did these get anything more than 1 star??? Buy some $5 ones and you will end up with better quality. I am returning mine ASAP."
2,bb,i like my skullcnady earbuds but i always have the same problem a month after i buy them one side goes out
3,Everything is good but the sound.,"These looked nice at the store and I was looking for some new in-ear headphones. They are constructed very well and they are comfortable. The volume control is nice too. The only problem? They sound bad. How bad? Well, I've bought $8 headphones that sound better than these. The sound is very dull. The lows are mushy and don't have much definition whereas the highs (or lack thereof) are very weak. I'll try to return them if I can.I give the aesthetics and comfort a 5/5, but since the point of these is to sound good and they don't, they get a 3/5 from me."
1,Not worth my time.,"The absolute worst pair of headphones I have ever used. The second day I had them one of the ear buds just fell off. Not the little rubber bud, the wires and all, just popped right off. Terrible sound quality. I just pulled them out of my purse, where they were secluded by themselves. apparently something outside of the pocket bumped them in a way that all the wire just disconnected. I don't have anything heavy in my purse, these were just poor quality. I was so disappointed because all my friends gave them such good reviews. Maybe I just got a bad pair, I'm not sure but I am not willing to risk my money on this product again."
1,"TERRIBLE design, poor quality","I JUST got these a few weeks ago and already the sound in the left ear is going out. And, yes, I checked it in my right ear. Also, you cannot use these while running or even walking. They fall out and it is most aggravating. Poor poor design, very disappointed after all the hype around this brand."
2,Skullcandy Smokin' Buds - Not so smokin',"I purchased these headphones from Best Buy about a month ago for $30. I had lost my stock Zune headphones so I decided to get something similar.As others have mentioned, the sound quality on these is pretty nice. There is a decent amount of bass and the volume slider is convenient. They come with a total of 4 different bud sizes to fit a variety of shapes to cater to your ear.The biggest problem with these headphones for me personally is that they do not sit well in the ear and fall out very easily. I have tried all four different sizes of ear buds and while each tends to provide a slightly different fit, they all generally start falling out after several minutes of listening, even if I am just sitting at my computer at work. Being a regular runner as well as an avid snowboarder, I was hoping for something much more solid. Unfortunately, these just aren't very worthwhile."
2,Worst Headphones Ever,"I bought both these and the Tis from Skullcandy, expecting to be blown away (because of all these rave reviews) only to be very disappointed. The sound quality of these headphones are terrible. Theres no bass. The ""covers"" fall off constantly and the headphones fall out very easily. Also, the wires and hte material is obviously very cheap so I wouldn't expect this to last very long either.For everyone who posted ""what do u expect for $20"", I've gotten better headphones for $14.Hell, the headphones that came with the portable radio in my shampoo (Garnier bottles used to have a free radio) are better."
3,Good,"I have them in pink and got it for my friend in white. They're nice just forgot to sign up the warrenty as soon as I got it and now I don't have the information that I need from the package [since I threw it out] to get a new pair. The metal ring got loose & I take care of my things well, so that wasn't great. Otherwise, sound quality is great and I use them for my ipod since these tend to stay in my ear."
2,not so smokin,"I really like skull candy headphones... but ive noticed that the wires in them break alot-- it sucks having music in only one ear. I purchased a pair of smoking ear buds.. thinking they might be diffrent from the lesser expensive skullcandy earbuds i normally buy... but no. In less than two weeks afer reciving them.. they were broken-- so no, i dont recommend them-- your better off with a cheaper pair, at least that way when they break you wont be so pissed!"
4,they do the job.,"they fit better into my ears than most of the other headphones that i've tried. the sound quality is okay. i wouldn't recommend using them for running though. the cord is a little heavy and tends to drag the headphones out of your ears. other than that, good headphones overall.*EDIT* though i was pretty satisfied with these headphones at first, after a few months of use.. i realized they break easily and the sound quality seemed to have gotten worse. also, upon using them, the insides of my ears continue to get irritated from the rubberlike material of the headphone coverings. deserves only one star at most."
2,Great...While they last!,"The sound of these earbuds is definitely awesome for their low price. They have rich bass which is hard to find in cheap headphones. But their durability needs some work. My right earbud gave out after 2 months. Other owners I know had the same problem. I hear that skullcandy will replace them, but thats not the point. Id rather spend a little more money and get durable headphones that have to wait for my replacements in the mail every couple months."
3,Horrible design,"I bought these because of the positive reviews for Skullcandy's regular headphones. I love the sound from these earbuds. However, I am a runner, and the silicon inserts on these buds do not stay in my ear. I tried all of the sizes - the problem is not with sizing, it is the actual material that is used. Any tiny bit of moisture, ear wax, or movement the headphones fall out. This is so annoying that I do not use them anymore. I certainly would not buy them again."
5,"Good, good, good.","This earbuds are very good, sound great, look great, and they have another important pro.they work like noise cancelling, block all sounds around.I really recommneded."
2,Not too great...,"The right earplug stopped working for no apparent reason about two weeks after I bought them. Until then, the sound was not bad and they were reasonably comfortable. However, the cable was a little too short for a tall guy like me (6'3"") and made it hard to use them for jogging."
2,Nice little headphones 'til they broke,"Reading these reviews, I see I'm not alone. These are nice, comfortable little headphones with a great bass thump. The cord was a little shorter than I'd have liked, but I could work with it. Then the right ear piece just stopped working. They're only 4 months old, and have been well-cared for. Now they're garbage for me. Buyer beware since I see others here have had this identical problem."
2,Why did they die?,I loved these so much at first so cute and had great sound. They seemed to act as earplugs to the world outside and I loved that they didn't fall out like other earbuds. However after a month of use the right ear stopped working and no one would take them back very frustrating. Make sure to buy these from the dealer so that they will take them back with the lifetime guarantee.
3,Don`t bother,"I bought these headphones for my son. From what he says the sound was pretty good, and the inline volume control looked good, but within 3 weeks the left ear failed. Don`t bother with customer service, no one was even there.Might aswell flush $17 down the toilet."
1,Don't buy these,"I bought a pair of these recently, and within 2.5 days of when I received them they stopped working. Not sure why, but my brother had two pairs of them as well and they both had exactly the same problem. I'm not saying don't buy from skullcandy because some of their headphones work really well, just avoid these."
3,Good and Not,"The price was more than acceptable compared to other earphones. I think the sound quality is excellent but only when I use the larger size ear buds which are too big for me. I have to really push them in to get a good seal (but they are comfortable). Also the asymetrical cord continues to pull the left ear bud out, especially when I'm riding bike or running on the beach.I found the packaging to be very difficult to open and when I used a pair of scissors ended up slicing through one of the smaller ear buds! Good thing I wasn't able to use them because of the sound quality, or I would have added insult to injury.These are a good pair of earphones for anyone who is trying to save some money and not lose sound quality. I will invest more on my next pair and be completely certain that the wire lengths are symetrical. But until then - they'll do."
3,Skullcandy Smokin Buds....average,"These things are pretty good for the price, but just don;t stay in your ears... at all. Don't bother with these if you plan on doing any sort of running, or even work outside..(especially if you have dirty hands and don;t wanna touch them)They are great to watch your computer while sitting on the couch...etc"
1,"Give out easily, and the covers will come off.","After being doubly disappointed by this product, I felt compelled to take the time to actually write a review which is something I RARELY do.So I bought this product based on my Bf's recommendation. After about two months, one of the ear buds gave out. I contacted Skullcandy and they were great about it and just requested to send back the ear buds for new ones, which I received in a timely manner. Satisfied with their customer service, I was happy to have had my Smokin' Ear Buds replaced at no charge. However, after three months of regular use at the gym, one of the buds gave out yet AGAIN.I'm thoroughly disappointed with this product. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and thought I had bought a defective pair the first time around... but sadly, this product is of poor quality. I'm moving on to the V-Moda Bass-Freq... Good bye Skullcandy."
2,nice while it lasted,When i first bought these things they were awesome and really cute. i loved the volume control they isolated noise pretty well just not wind but for the price i guess one can't expect much. all of a sudden the right ear just stopped working. i only had them for about a month and i wish i kept the receipt or the box maybe i could've had some sort of reimbursement but I'll never know hopefully everyone else has better luck with those
2,Do Not Buy.,"I bought a white one from Fry's few month ago becausea it was the cheapest one on the shelf. i regret it now.the sound is pretty good, but it is a pain in the ass to put the ear bud into your ear. the ear bud is simply too soft (cheap material) and tend to fold when u try to incert them into your ear. also, due to the material is too soft, the bud section can be easily removed from the ear phone itself, and results in losing the bud. (i lost two buds in 2 month)the cord is super short.SUPER SHORT. i intended to use it with my nano, but the cord's lenght is not even long enough to connect my pants pocket to my ear.lastly. the cord plastic is cheap. after using it for 2 month, the plastic starts to change its color and becoem rigid.don't buy...."
2,Good sound quality,"So I got these headphones about 6 months ago, and tonight my right earbud would not produce any sound.I mostly use these for listening to music while I play games, and I was so annoyed when I couldn't hear anything outof the right ear bud. I bought these for $30 and for the price I guess that they worked well, but I expectedfor the headphones to last me more than 6 months that is so ridiculous. I am so mad at this brand right now.I did really like these earbuds but after this I will not be purchasing from this brand again."
4,'scull 'candy earbuds,"Only a small difficulty keeping them in your ears. One 'bud is louder than the other, but has a wonderful slider to adjust the volume. Perhaps I use them for other than what they were intended for. I use them to hear my tv so as not to disturb others. 'for me, they're exactly right."
2,Not my Favorite,Pros: Pretty good noise blocking and like the volume control on chord.Cons: Fall out of your ears easily. Especially while running or working out. Right side of headphones stopped working after about a month.
3,"Great sound, but didn't last too long...","I got these headphones as a gift, and for the first few months they were amazing! I've never heard better sound from headphones, and they fit in my ears perfectly. However, after five months, the sound started to get fuzzy, and the right earbud went out a week later. Deciding to give them another try, I bought a second pair to replace the first. But sure enough, four months later, the same EXACT thing occured. So, great sound and incredibly comfortable, but you might have to replace them every few months."
4,Great sound and function for the price.,These earbuds are definitely the best buy for your money. At under $20 they are a vast improvement over the standard set that come with an iPod and really help to improve the audio quality.My only complaint is that the buds tend to fall out while I'm jogging unless I put the slider up just under my chin and let the excess chord hang out over my collar and pull the metal part underneath my t-shirt. If you rig it correctly they'll stay in without much hassle.Noise cancellation is minimal but you can really crank the volume with these. All in all a great buy.
3,Not So Great.,"I Love These Headphones. But I'd Rather Buy The Red One's Cause The Little Rubber Part That Went Into Your Ear Fell Off Of My Headphone's When I Was On A Airplane OMG How Embrassing That Was For Me. I Was Going To Get A New Set Of The Rubber Part's But I Thought ""Maybe Not Cause Well What If That Same Part Come's Off Again."" So....If Your Really Want Good Headphone's But Not Have To Worry About Losing Anything That Come's With It Than I Wouldn't Get These."
1,Garbage.,"People who think these sound good must not have ever had a decent pair. I'm coming from a pair of Sony MDR-EX51 that sounds really nice. These sound tinny and as if you were listening through fabric. Horrid, just horrid."
3,Skullcandy needs to put more money into research than marketing.,"The earbuds work decent, and I've had them for about 5 months. The sound from it isn't too bad, however if you are ever moving (working out, running, etc) the earbuds constantly fall out.As if that wasn't inconvenient enough, the rubber part of the earbuds kept coming lose. And although they give you 3 pairs of different sizes, now at the end of 5 months, I have lost 1 of each size, so the headphones are pretty much useless.I spent 10 bucks for these, and I don't think it is worth much more than that."
3,Good while it lasted...,"The ""Skullcandy SC-SBW3.5 Smokin Bud"" was actually 5 stars while it lasted, but about a week and a half after using them the right ear sound went out, other than that, they did their job, I'll actually buy another pair in hopes that none of the sound goes out because they were that good in the first place."
3,Good sound/not so good earplugs/cord,"They sound good,I got em for a good price.I don't like the ear pieces these came with,they came with two different sets but kept falling out of my ears.Only reason I bought them was because my etymotic sound isolating earbuds gave out after a year and I used the earpieces from those on these and I like these alot more with the etymotic ear pieces.I don't know if i got a bad set or what but the cord to the left ear bud was about 8 inches and the cord going to the right earbud was about 18 inches"
2,"They suck, and they hurt","I'm not an audiophile, and even I can tell this is bad. I played Radiohead with my ipod and it sounded like a tin can. Also, these things hurt your ears. I get a headache everytime I put them in. Without listening to music it hurts regardless. My ears are not mishaped in any way. This is just a poor product. For cheap earphones that have good quality, get the Coby's."
1,Don't Buy,"I bought these headphones to attach to my pocket pc phone, but when they didn't fit, so I decided to use them on my pc at work. The only way to keep the ear phones from falling out of your ear is to jam them into your ear canal which is very uncomfortable. I do like the length of the wires and the fact that you can control the volume. However the maximum volume is not very high (the headphones I got with my IPOD are much louder.) Also I found it impossible to rap the earphones into the case neatly, I would always end up bunching them together and cramming them into the case, then I have to untangle them once I open the case."
3,Smokin Earbuds,"These are nice for people with the different sized ear pieces as some people are not able to wear the discs that fit in the ear. I enjoy these as they fit right in the ear, they are snug and do not fall out. The only thing is the clarity is not as good as expected."
4,Smokin cool,"Was skeptical when I bought those earphones; Was not sure how they will sound and feel in the ear. However, I haven't taken them off all day, and to my surprise they fit well and comfortable. The only draw-back is the box supplied with earphones It took a good 5 min to put the earbuds into it. A bit clumsy box, will probably not use to avoid the cover breaking the thin cable.The smokin buds provide a decent noise reduction as they fit well in the ear and remove surounding sounds.Recommend as a good value for the money."
4,Not bad for the price,"Just picked these up yesterday. I got a version with different ear sleeves - etymotic ones to be precise. With these sleeves the sound is quite impressive, bass with real depth and response - I didn't think you could get that from headphones. The only reason for four stars is the fact that the sleeves pictured above don't work very well - its hard to get a good seal and they seem to get dislodged much more easily than the etymotics. Other than that, I'm happy I didn't drop an extra $70 for the real thing. Awesome sound."
3,so so,These are alright but they don't fit my ears that well even though they have 3 sizes. These tend to fall out easily. The base is sort of weak. The higher notes sound ok though. Other then that you get what you payed for.
2,Good for less than a day,"They sounded great for the one day that they worked. I had a few problems getting them to fit in my ear correctly, but once they were in, the sound was pretty good. Unfortunately, after less than a day of use, the left ear bud went dead. How disappointing! They are going back to Amazon for a refund...I'll spend my money on another brand."
3,"Great sound, poor fit","These headphones are stylish and sound great. The base and treble are balanced. However; if you are buying them for an active lifestyle, look elsewhere. As most other headphones they constantly fall out of your ears. I tried both sizes of ear buds and neither helped. The buds need a beaded finish or something to grip to the inside of your ear.Bottom line, if you are getting these to chill in your room and listen to a new album they are great for the price. If you are getting them to take to the gym, run, etc...skip em."
4,Good Sound,"I bought this for a backup pair of headphones. This is my 2nd pair Skull Candy earbuds. Same great sound, but the wires seem to be much thinner than my last pair (which are still working). So I am hoping they last as long as the original pair. Love the colors, totally rock, as does the sound for this price. One day I will buy the 300$ pair, but for now, these work just fine."
3,decent pair of headphones,not the best but are cheap and cancel out sound fairly well... which is the only reason why i bought them.
2,These headphones are a waste of your money,"Forget running, these things fall out of your ear when you're sitting and listening to music. They're also extremely fragile. The music quality is pretty good for how cheap the price is. However, if they can last more than a couple of weeks, you've gotten more out of them than probably the majority of normal people that buy these things."
1,Broken within two days of purchase!,"My 14 year old son saved up his money and purchased these ear buds. He was so proud. Unfortunately, within two days of receiving them, one of the earpieces broke. Now he only hears through one side. He's VERY disappointed and would not recommend them."
2,"Great, if only they'd stay in!","They sound great, but all be damned if they stay in your ears when you get sweaty. I had to buy a different pair because I was CONSTANTLY putting these buds back in my ears throughout my run. If you're hooking them up to a computer or not going to be running/sweating while using these, they're fine...really bad for running."
1,cheap and plasticky!,I bought a skullcandy at Ross for $8 and thought since I was paying more for these it would be better quality. The ones from Ross is made of metal buds these are all plastic construction and like previous reviewers state it does not stay in your ear. The ones from Ross are sound proof while these are not. Save you money and buy something else.
2,"Cheap quality, bass isn't great. Colors look fancy.","Pros: Looks, colorsCons: Very cheap quality. Bass isn't too great, lacks depth in sound.Bottom Line: There are better alternatives in the market."
2,Sound not very crisp,"I purchased a pair of Skullcandy Smokin' Buds headphones based on a lot of positive reviews I'd read here and other places. Unfortunately, the sound was not nearly as good as those reviews had made me believe. The one positive thing about the sound quality was that the bass was pretty good. Everything else was negative. The treble was very weak. The overall sound was mushy. There was really no crispness at all.It may not be fair to compare this product with more expensive models, but my Sony pair ($50) has a lot more crisp sound without losing much bass. I am going to return the Smokin' Buds tomorrow."
4,Surprisingly good sound,"These are a very good deal for the price. The sound is rich and full, the adjustable volume is a bonus, and all in all they outperform any other headphones in the same price range so much that they seem like they should cost more. The plastic doesn't quite have the flexibility of more expensive plastic, though, so I wonder if the cord might be vulnerable."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Apparently Skullcandy puts design and how the earphones look first, quality later. Like everyone else said these broke within a week. The right earbud started losing sound and within 3 weeks there was nothing coming out of it, and the left one started fading too. USELESS."
1,"Were great,but then they suck","The colors look great and awesome.But the headphones failedi had them for over 3 months andwhich then one of the headphones stopped working.The cord is made with cheap material,and the headphones sound awful comparedto my other headphones[...]"
1,Absolutely Terrible!,These are by far the worst headphones I have used in the past 10 years. They come out of your ears far to easily with any of the tips installed. These are worse than the cheaper ink'd model from the same company. Then there is the sound quality. I wish I would have taken 1 second to look at the frequency response. 100 to 18000hz... 100hz!@!# Anybody that says these things has amazing bass... or any bass at all for that matter is full of it. Do yourself a favor and get a better set of headphones for probably cheaper.
5,wow.....if you can find your sleeve size,i love these headphones because they have a very strong bass and pretty good sound quality but theres a small price to pay for excellence in these earbuds and well its the cord its really thin if you can take good care of these they will be among the best you will ever own if you can find your ideal sleeve.
2,Not a terrible set for $20,"After my 3rd set of in-ear buds, I've decided that they're just not for me. However, these are the worst yet. I'm built pretty ""normal"" but none of the 3 interchangeable earpieces fit me. I feel like the middle ones should fit, but they just won't stay put. Also, the cord is a tad too long and keeps getting snagged on things.On the bright side, the sound quality is good and the volume control on the cord is very convenient and useful. For 20 bucks, not a terrible set, but don't expect anything amazing."
3,"Great sound, poor fit.","The sound quality is absolutely amazing; there is a perfect balance of bass, middle, and treble. Unfortunately, the bud constantly falls out of your ear and needs repositioning every few minutes. If I had known this, I would not have bought these. Though this is definitely better than the default iPod earbuds, try to find some with good quality and comfort."
1,Stopped working correctly 3 days after return window expired,"These have pretty good sound quality, but within almost exactly a month the cord stopped working correctly and the sound began cutting out. Cheaply made crap. You're better off buying 6 sets of $3 headphones, you'll get more use out of them."
3,"Good sound, but you get what you pay for..","I loved these headphones for the month they worked. It's like they had a countdown timer until the left ear-bud stopped working for no reason the other day. These are really good headphones, nice and loud with good bass, but you obviously have a huge trade off in construction quality. I'd recommend these to people that are willing to pay for them again after a month or two of use."
4,I sold these to a friend after a week.,"Compared to my v-moda bass earbuds, they werent as comfortable and the sound wasnt as good. These were okayy and were expected for the price. I say you buy a pair of v-moda bass earbuds instead. I LOVE them. Also, theyre priced the same as these"
3,"Decent earbuds, nothing special","After my old earbuds broke (Skullcandy Ink'd) I decided to upgrade and test the waters.You should test other waters.These are decent quality headphones that have a good price, but besides that there's not really anything outstanding that I can say about them. The sound is good, slightly better than ok, but significantly less than great. I like the convenience of the volume slider, but the wires feel really flimsy and make me nervous. I like the exra long wires but they do get caught on things easily. To be honest, I prefer my old Ink'd buds much better (they broke a little too easily but to be fair I was hard on them), and I'll probably switch back to them for my next pair."
2,"If you don't listen to music, these are fine for the $","I bought these because of the price and that there was not anything else under $40 at Radio Shack (aka The Shack) and I was in a hurry. Excuses, excuses, I know. These ear buds were OK but the music sounded terrible. I didn't have any problem when listening to podcasts and audio books but music just didn't sound right. I only had one pair so maybe it was a fluke. For the price I paid ($15) my guess I got was I paid for."
2,Nothing but Treble,"My Sony earbuds finally needed to be replaced. I bought the Skullycandy earbuds because they were in the store around the corner from my job and because I heard about the brand and wanted to try it out.I use the earbuds with my 1st Gen iTouch. I like the fact that I can regulate the volume from the headphones. What is really disturbing is that the sound is not of the greatest quality. It is all treble. I tried to change the iTouch equalizer setting but nothing really changed, still all treble.I guess it is my own fault for not checking the package to see that it said ""stereo"" but these days isn't stereo a given?The earbuds can be used the best when listening to podcasts or audiobooks; music is a no no."
2,Horrible Durability,"In my opinion these headphones are terrible. I bought these headphones 3 days ago and they already broke. I was just simply starting my run, and noticed my music starting to cut out. so I moved around the wire at the headphone track and I knew it was a faulty jack. So for durability, this is not your thing. Sound quality:Crispness: 6Bass: 7Volume: 3Noise reduce: 8"
3,Fair.,"The flat wires are very flimsy.Newer ones don't have the advertised volume control.They sound okay, my Ink'd ones sound better and cost less."
4,These are awesome headphones but...,"I first bought these headphones from my university's bookstore. I had never seen them before and I thought I would try them out just to see if they could actually cancel out noise. To my surprise they really worked. About a month ago, my first pair broke. I bought another and they also broke, the right earbud would always short out.I'm now on my 4th pair and I've switched to the black version. I'm hoping that Skullcandy will see that the cord with which they make these is very cheap and needs to be upgraded, probably to a more sturdy cord and a much more sturdy casing to hold it in place, which was the cause of my problem."
4,Smokin' Budz,These earphones work quite well. The way they fit into your ear blocks a lot of the outside noise.
3,cord,"i just bought some, and i think they are alot better than the ipod headphones,but one side of the cord is a whole lot shorter than the other one, is this how it should be or a defect?"
1,Never Received,Can't review based on this product as I never received it but it general have had these smokin buds in the and love them. It's great that they have inline volume control.
2,A Bug in Volume Control?,"Just a few words. I just received my Skullcandy Smokin' Bud, 3.5 - White today. It's comfortable in my ears, but I have noticed that every time I use the volume control, it makes noise. I purchased this item because of its convenient volume control function, but now I feel the volume control is a potential trouble to my listening experience. I guess I won't use it anymore, unless someday the problem amazingly disappears. In addition, the right bud has some damage."
3,"Awesome sound, but the volume control stinks",The sound on these headphones is amazing.The volume control is not. It seems like the volume control was made cheaply and when I try to change the volume the sound goes down (or out) on one side of the headphones. I have to mash and wiggle the volume control knob in order to regain sound equally out of both ears (only sometimes does this word).
4,Not bad. Not bad at all!,"For $17, these things blow away the iPhone buds, which I find horrible (especially for bass).When I first got the package I was a bit disappointed to see the bass only goes down to 100hz, but in actual use it sounds to me like they are being cautious with their ratings as the bass sounds VERY good to me.Upper range is shown to limit out at 18khz, but being 48 y/o and a former Sonar Tech, my ears can't get that high anyway. Nor can most of the populations.I think they sound just great.The only concern is reliability. We'll have to see."
3,Not bad...,"The Skullcandy Smoking buds are not a product for the price, however, I also own a pair of Skullcandies Ink'd buds and I find that they are better and they cost me half the price as these. And the Ink'd come in better colors."
5,Greatest earbud headphones I've ever used!,"I just bought these headphones (the pink ones) and I have to say these are the most impressive earbud headphones I'v ever used. I have really small ears, so usually this type of headphone never fits in my ear, or starts to hurt after a while. These come with three different sizes of rubber padding, so they'll fit your ears no matter what size. They're extremely comfortable. The volume control on the cord is a great feature, I really like that but until now I could only find that on around-or-over-your-head headphones. The noise cancellation of these is also exceptional. Right now, I'm sitting in a room full of loud people, playing a loud shooting video game. I can't hear them at all. I don't even have my music turned up very loud, and it's all I can hear. The sound quality is great too! The bass sounds great and loud, a first for any headphones I've had.These are the greatest headphones I've ever owned! I recommend them highly to anyone."
1,crap.,I bought these for new headphone and ended up wasting my money. The first one sent out would only play out of he left bud but then the second pair sent out had the same problem not worth the time or money is they never work.
2,"Fan of skullcandy, but not this model","My first skull candy headphones were a mid-level pair I bought in person at a store. They had great sound and fit well. I was also a big fan of the volume adjuster on the cord.When those wore out, I purchased these. I suspected they might not be the same style, as the ones I bought were in the $25 range and these were a bit cheaper, but I wasn't sure if that was an amazon discount or not.I used these for a bit. They're smaller, not as sturdy, and in general I didn't find them to be a very good headset. The sturdiness issue was confirmed when one day when walking into the gym, I knew the headphones (which had been hanging a little lose) and bumped the door on the way in. When I went to put them in, the ear knob has snapped off.I took it as the motivator I needed and repurchased the next model up, which once again proved to be a great pair on headphones."
1,false advertising,when i ordered these headphones i was expecting the kind in the image which had laced wires and the ones i got were yellowed with being stored so long and not with laced wire like in the image...
1,DOA and Warranty Over A Month,"These headphones were DOA, but I wasn't too worried because SkullCandy's warranty seemed to be pretty great. However after I sent my phones in I have been unable to contact SkullCandy or get an estimate on when I will get them back or get a new pair. It has been over a month and they keep saying they ""will get me my headphones soon.""This will be the last pair of SkullCandy headphones I will ever buy."
4,"Nice color stones, good quality",Very happy with this bracelet for my wife. The quality was good. The stones were a nice color of blue. I would buy it again.
1,cheap and not functional,"This lasted about a whole 10 minutes before I was back on here to return this. No matter what she did, my wife could not work the clasp to even get it on her wrist.No matter how it may or may not have looked, if she can't work the clasp to get it on, there's no way it is going to stay."
4,Nice,We were really happy with our gold box purchase. The blue was slightly lighter in shade than we were expecting (trying to match some earrings/necklace) but not pale... nice color.
4,$199? Seriously?,Apparently people are dumb enough to pay $200 for a board game. There are more idiots out there than I thought.
3,Not what is advertised!,Please note: this CD only contains music from the Kurosawa film Dodeskaden. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN MUSIC FROM DERSU UZALA.
4,Surprisingly Awesome,"Surprisingly awesome.Movie tells the tale of parking lot attendants and attendant alumni of the Corner Parking Lot in Charlottesville, Virginia the home of the University of Virginia.It's a motley lot of attendants, many graduate students, most terribly overqualified. And of how entitled people are today, especially after alcohol is involved. Fascinating Sociology.We need to treat people nicer. I hope America becomes a nicer place again. You are not better than a parking lot attendant just because you have a fancy car.Highly recommended and free on Amazon Prime."
2,Exhaustingly talky,"I really wanted to like this film. Really, I did. I remember originally hearing about it on NPR and thought it was somewhat entertaining when I watched the trailer back then. Well, the film is like a much longer, far less funny version of the trailer. I thought an hour and 11 minutes would be a good length, but it was about an hour too long for me. I'm glad I didn't pay anything to watch this film, thanks to a $4 credit Amazon gave when I purchased another DVD. If you knew people in the film or live in Charlottesville, watch it. If you like hearing mostly white guys talk incessantly, watch it. If it's free, watch it. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Marginal cry babies have their say,"Many will think this some sort of ode to working class imagination. Bull. The attendants interviewed here are nothing but a collection of bitter, petty children looking to get back at life's mainstream through insulting, abusive service and disgraceful, childish actions (I think my favorite was the pin-head who, with obvious pride, said his little act of defiance was putting the customer car in park by yanking up on the park lever so hard it was difficult to disengage it. He actually bragged about this like it was cool). What's next? A documentary romanticizing the fast food workers that spit in customers food?"
1,No Insight,"I was very disappointed with this movie. I was expecting a good story or to learn something new, but the information presented in this movie is so plain and common sense. If you want to know what it's like working a dead-end job, maybe this movie would show you something. If you already know what that's like, just look in the mirror and you've seen this movie. Even if you're the jackass with the excursion and have no self-awareness, this movie won't make you a better person--it just doesn't present a coherent case for anything.I still can't figure out the message of the movie, unless the message is to be nicer to strangers, but that would be a bit hypocritical."
3,"documents ""slice of life"" view of quirky people","A better description comes from PBS.org: ""... celebrates a brotherhood of eccentric attendants who man a unique parking lot in Charlottesville, Virginia [a university town]. From grad students to middle-age slackers, indie-rock musicians to surly philosophers, these overeducated part-timers wax profoundly about car culture and capitalism, seek vengeance against entitled patrons and thieves, and make fun of drunken jerks.""Perhaps this is more like ""Slackers"" - not the kind of gripping drama or compelling storyline of many of PBS's Independent Lens offerings (I mean, compare it with the film of the Jewish woman who parachuted in to save others from the Nazis). This is more like a distilled experience of spending time with some interesting and intelligent characters who are figuring out their lives."
3,Great System but Too Many Unit Failures,"Really enjoy the feel on my eyes that my contacts have after being cleaned! (I have not, however, done any researching regarding the actual efficacy of the cleaning procedure). The system works great for about 4 to 6 months. After that the unit stops working. I have been using this system for almost two years now and have been through about 4 or 5 units. The electrical contacts on the bottom part become corroded and no amount of scrapping seems to fix the problem. So far this has been a minor inconvenience since I have been able to return the faulty unit and get a new one free of charge. I hope they will keep exchanging the broken units free of charge."
2,good product....don't use this supplier though.,"This supplier charges almost $10.00 more than other suppliers and even the manufacturer. I wondered why, so went to AC Lens site. They call there product ""complete care system"" and other suppliers call it, ""starter set"". On the AC Lens site they show the same picture as they show on amazon and this box looks different than that of the starter set. They show below it, 12 bottles of solution, so I thought, that must explain the higher price. Well, I received the same starter set as the other suppliers are selling for $10 less and no extra solution. When I called AC Lens, they said what is shown on their site and on amazon is a box containing 12 bottles of solution. What??!!? The box shows a picture of the plug in cleaning unit. Also, that would mean they are selling 12 bottles of solution for almost twice as much as the other sellers on amazon. Just ridiculous. Great product. Buy it from a different amazon seller."
5,Chemical free and loving it!,"I've been using a Purilens contact lens cleaner for more than two years and I'm happy to say that it works great for me. Before I discovered this system, I struggled with reactions to chemical cleaners and really thought that I was going to have to stop wearing contacts after more than 25 years as a wearer. I explored LASIK as an alternative, but was not impressed by the expertise at any of the local clinics (or the fact that this 'surgery' is not regulated and no one knows yet what the long term consequences will be). Thankfully, I found the PuriLens system through an Internet search."
1,disney makes great movies and that's about it...,"Once again, another Disney toy fails to live up to what it's offering. We had to rig this thing time and time again to get either the princesses to talk like they are supposed to, or just to get the flap to stay shut so my daughter could do the rubbing. VERY POOR QUALITY TOY!!!! Even the crayons don't write as well as a crayola."
1,Not suitable for use with high speed pellet rifle.,Shooting into it with my GAMO rifle and heavy .177 pellets and it's tearing up after less than 100 rounds.
5,A good solid pellet trap,"This trap is made well with thick steel plates. It is very good for 10 m target practice.Although it is made of thick steel, when a pellet hits the center of the trap from magnum air rifle such as Diana RWS48 or Gamo Shadow Sports, the steel plate at the tip of cone is bent and deformed after a few shots. Noticing this, I have filled this pellet trap with 4 sticks (1 lb each) of Duct Seal (~$2.00 each) that is available at Home Depot or Lowes. After filling the cone with the Duct Seal, even with hundreds of pellets, pellets can penetrate only up to 3 inches or so. Also, we hear no metal noise when the pellet hits the target. If you are targeting with accurate guns, the face size 5.5"" x 5.5"" of this trap seems large enough to make a few small groupings, and you can have hours of target shooting enjoyment."
1,"""A Very Poor Trap Indeed!""","This pellet trap is not strong enough for todays higher power pellet pistols and rifles. I used my Benjamin Trail XL 1100 22 cal break barrel on this trap at 30 yards and blew the heck out of it with less than 50, 14.3 gr. HP rounds. If you have a air gun that shoots under 600 fps and at a low ft-lbs of muzzle energy then it may hold up. My Benjamin Trail develops 1100 fps at 30 ft-lbs of muzzle energy and this took this trap apart, literally. The back flap deflector gone, shot clean off after 15 rounds and a hole the size of a quarter shot through the back of the pellet trap can, had to back this ""poor thing"" up with a thick phone book. Very disappointing to say the least. This thing is now in my recycle scrap bin, may it rest in peace!"
1,"Gamo cone pellet trap, poor quality, not fit for purpose","After purchasing this trap from Amazon, I used it only 3 times, shooting with an average (.177 cal.)air rifle, not some high velocity rifle. This trap is not suitable for the purpose intended. The rails which hold the paper target are badly deformed from pellet impacts and so is the pellet trap which attaches behind the cone. Prior to purchasing this trap I read some negative reviews pointing this problem out, but thought I might try it anyway.I found out as others did that the metal from which the whole trap is fabricated is much to thin.I recomend against purchasing this product."
4,Works For Me,"Although a bit small but it worked for me sighting my scope on a Crosman Raven. No damage to the trap at approx. 50 feet, might be a problem with my RWS 1000 fps rifle, mat have to increase the distance. Overall it worked out great for me, got my scope sighted and shot alot of pesky noisy fruit eating birds!"
3,Not bad but could be better,"Not a bad product, but does not trap bbs with authority. Some bounce around and escape back through the target as opposed to being forced into the trap."
5,Nice Little Trap,"It is a nice, compact little pellet trap. Easy to put together; easy to use. It is what it is!"
1,Very Poor Quality,"So this came un-assembled with nuts on the bolts of each side. The bolts and nuts were so corroded that after unscrewing them the threads were gone and I had a pile of rust. The powder coating was so poor it's hard to describe. Super thick coating in some parts, none in others.Edit: The wife and I put a few dozen rounds through it, almost all of the coating has burst off the cone, and I'm pretty sure that if we were to use a bench rest we'd drill right through it in a few shots. I'm using a 1377 with 5 pumps on this guy. So WAY below what it's speced for."
1,Not heavy enough,"I shot the back out of this product very quickly. It worked fine with 550 fps .177. I used it to sight in a more powerful gun, a 1000fps .177. After a few groups the back was shot out. I used standard weight lead pellets at about 27 feet. Oh well at least is was cheap. I may send it back."
2,Am I the only one who didn't like this book?,"The story line is predictable, the writing lacks polish, and what passes as a ""twist"" at the end is nothing more than an inexperienced (and failed!) attempt at suspense. Glad I bought this book at a used book store; it wouldn't have been worth full price. Hey, anyone out there interested in buying my copy -- cheap!"
5,Awesome Album ACT TWO,"""Preservation"" is the greatest album by The Kinks in the 70s. As Village Green was in the 60s. But more ambicious.Don't listen to bad reviews. This is THE KINKS at their best.GET IT. BUY IT. ENJOY IT. LOVE IT.Long Live to the The Kinks for ""Preservation"".You are transported to a new world. Awesome recording and performances."
2,"Oh, come on","No, I have to speak up. How can everyone be bestowing five stars on this album? (or any of the Kinks mid 70's efforts) To put this bloated thing in the same class as Village Green, Arthur, Muswell Hillbillies (or Low Budget, for that matter) is ludicrous. I am a huge Kinks fan, and listened to this double LP many times, trying earnestly to become fond of it, but there is just not much there to get excited about. Ray is still a competant songwriter, but there are none of the inspired melodies of their classic late 60's and early 70's LP's. The whole thing sounds like Ray had run out of steam musically, even if he had an interesting concept to work with. It's a long way from being a bad album, but in The Kinks pantheon, this one is, in my opinion, quite rightfully neglected."
1,A Disaster,"Like Act 1, this album had about one LP-side's worth of decent material. However, on this album, that collected 20 minutes worth of songs just isn't as good as the best 20 minutes of the previous album (Act 1), and it's spread out over a double album instead of a single one. (Fortunately, it all fits on one CD, so you can program your CD player to deliver said 20 minutes of quality listening.) Instead of putting the enitre opera on the Kinks' albums, Davies & co. should have picked the highlights and put them all on one terrific LP, instead of 3."
4,Ray had a plan which almost worked,"The biggest trashers of this LP and some others in Ray and the Kinks '70s canon didn't really take into account that the '60s output of the band was based on the same sort of social commentary and worldview.Ray was influenced by English Music Hall and always liked to create visual images (Waikiki, Dedicated Follower of Fashion, etc., etc.).The fact that Ray had to have announcements splice the Act 2 together is the flaw here - Ray didn't focus the plotlines sufficiently enought that he needed devices to get his point across. Second-Hand Car Spiv, He's Evil and a few others are classic Ray.The fact that he tried to be ambitious and may have overreached is no great crime. This was the '70s, with Nektar and Tales of Topographic Oceans - Ray never took himself as seriously as some of the 'progressive' artists of that overblown decade.Buy thia and listen to it without preconceptions...you can dance to some of it!"
5,Great Album!,"This will always be among my favorite Kinks albums. There are simply so many great songs, and a lot of great guitar from Dave. Lots of variation style; great melodies, interesting story.I saw the Kinks perform ""Preservation Act"" on Royalty Theatre in December 1974. I was ""sold"" right from the opening song ""Preservation"" which I did not know at the time, as it had only been released on an obscure single. This song can now be found on the CD release of ""Preservation Act 1"" which is also highly recommendable. My first Kinks album after ""Golden Hour of the Kinks""."
3,"5 to 7 good tracks, concept fails","this is for other Kinks fans who are unsure whether to buy this or not. I bought it originally in 1974, and was disappointed. A clunker for sure. It's hard to listen to the whole thing. HOWEVER, for the true fan there are some Ray Davies classics, plus some good tracks. ""Nobody Gives"" and ""When a Solution Comes"" are the best things here, especially ""Nobody Gives"" is a MUST HAVE. There are 2 Ray Davies ballads that hold up well (and I'm suprised no other artists have covered them): ""Nothing lasts forever"" and ""Where oh where is love?"" Plus, there are three fun Kinks songs that will surely bring a smile to your face: ""He's Evil,"" ""Money Talks,"" and ""Mirror of Love."" If you're not a Kinks fan, skip this. But if you are, pick it up for those tracks."
5,Klassic Kinks,"Having read the other reviews, good, bad or indifferent, all I can tell anyone who cares is that on a chilly March night in '74 at the Music Hall in Boston, 4 buddies and I sat in awe of one of the greatest rock and roll bands ever - Dave Davies came out and said ""1st, we're gonna prove we're still The Kinks"" and proceeded to rock like nobody's business; then after a short break, out came ""THE KINKS"" in all la glory and gave us an elaborate, finely tuned night of rock and roll theater like only Ray can do. The music, costumes, choreography were all brillant and it endeared these albums to me forever. Please give them the time and respect they deserve - it's friggin' Ray Davies and the Kinks at their peak!"
4,cool cartoon sounds,"This is one of my favorite Kinks albums (others being face to face and VGPS). This and Preservation act 1 is actually a expansion on Villiage Green preservation society using a couple of the characters from the album of about 6 years before. The vaudvillian ""scum of the earth"" leads perfectly into ""2nd hand car spiv"" (which is very similar to the chase scenes of Tom and Jerry cartoons of the 7o's) has inncredible horn/ keyboard arrangments is excillerating to listen to. ""Mirror of Love"" is a tongue in cheek love song song to the main character's one and only; while Shepards of the Nation would make any PC thinking cringe in horror, also based on the VGPS theme. ""When a solution comes"", and ""artifical Man"" are personal favorites besides the formentioned. Did Brooks and Dunne (borrow) ""Scrapheap city"" and rename it ""bootscoot boogie""- anyway!!!!!... This is a very fun album to listen to; and it makes you want to boogie and it makes you want to think.. about boogie-ing."
3,Too Long,"Stockings are good quality,but due to me being 4ft 11 the garter came too low and i couldnt where them.would recomend them to a taller person."
1,"Horrible quality, broke upon opening up","Never seen any stockings so fragile and so badly made. I only got to open the package, and it broke even before I put it completely on. Next thing I had to do was to throw into trash can. Never buy it seriously..."
5,cute gag gift,"bought this as a gag gift for my husband, but the grandkids have more fun with it. They get upset when the horse is empty. Keeps them entertained."
2,Seriously boring stories,"""Another boring story?""(I read the next section)""Ugh, that was nasty. Maybe this one will be better!""(And it was not)Normally, I love any type of German literature. I am an avid fan of learning the German language and would likely be considered an advanced student. However, this book was boring! The stories, although well translated, simply did not hold my interest.Others may enjoy this book, but I would not recommend it to anyone who likes a good story. Maybe you can use it for just learning the language, but I warn you that you might find yourself yawning and looking out the window."
3,Parallel text is a bit distracting,"I bought this book to help me learn german but I found the parallel text a bit too distracting (german is side by side with English). It is just to easy to glance over, like watching a subtitled movie. I feel that full immersion is more effective."
3,For upper intermediate/advanced German students,"Pros: This is a great book with compelling short stories.Cons: Perhaps this speaks to my level of German fluency, but I find the German to be unnecessarily difficult in some stories. This is not made easier by the loose dynamic-equivalent translation which constructs fine English, but does so, at times, exceeding its purpose as an aid (crutch) to the reader. I found the looseness of the translation caused me to sometimes use a dictionary, which I feel defeats the purpose of the book.In my mind this critique is comparing the pedagogy of this book with that of the French version, which is an excellent balance of difficultly and literal translation."
1,Short Stories in German,"Small, very light print hard to read. I bought it for a grandson for his German studies; did not like it!"
2,Pyrex 4 quart Roaster,"Really disappointed!Listed as ""Measures approximately 15 by 5 by 9 inches""actual dimansions: 15 by 2 1/2 x 11 inches.So the height was only half of what was described.It arrived on time, in excellent condition, but clearly not what I expected."
5,glass roaster,"very nice item, everything i expected, packing very good recieved short time after order, would order from this company again"
2,No life,I bought this to have a back battery for my Nikon SLR. It is good for that. It discharges very quickly though. You would not want it for your primary battery.
1,Trays melted,"On the first use, making beef jerkey, the plastic trays melted after about 8 hours. Will not recommend this product to anybody."
5,love the product,This is the best dehydrator have used -- I do lots of venison jerky and the slow cooking I get from this dehydrator is excellent --- I plan to do vegetables and fruit when in season - living in the country as I do will be able to save on storage space -- canning in jars takes up lots of space and freeze canning takes up freezer space - I hunt and fish and utilize a dehydrator lots.
1,better off to use the oven,Exposed heating coil can make a huge mess when drippings land on it. There are often hot and cold spots leading to uneven drying. Top trays drip onto lower trays potentially mixing flavors. Top trays do not dry as quickly as lower trays necessitating tray rotation. Cleaning the trays after making jerky is a nightmare. Small pieces fall through the spaces in the trays. Either get a much better dehydrator or save your money and use a cookie sheet in the oven set on low.
4,Cheap but good for the newbie,"I got the Ronco dehydrator free from a friend who thought it was the kind of thing I would like (she was right!). I agree with other reviews that the machine is pretty dinky and I'm planning to build my own dehydrator one of these days (for a design see the hippie food-drying bible ""Dry It -- You'll Like It!""). But I've been using it for a couple of years with great results. We live in NYC and during the summer running the oven for days on end is just not an option. So the dehydrator is terrific if you don't want to spend money, want something that's quiet, and don't mind that it might break. It's also a minimal investment if you're not sure that you want to be the obsessive dehydrator that I've become...."
4,Dry food,"This thing does what it says. It takes a long time to dry certain items and because there is a heater at the bottom food 'cooks' slightly but overall an easy to use and reliable product. Don't leave it too close to your oven though, the unit is made of a pretty cheap plastic and it will melt and deform easily."
4,Good inexpensive model to start with,"I have used my Ronco Dehydrator for quite some time now. I honestly love the beef jerky that you can create. You can spice to your personal preference. This dehydrators like many others has trays that you need to manually rotate. So plan to do this when you are going to be around the house to rotate your trays. The heating element like another suggested isn't protected, so you want to be sure to keep that extra clean, especially when working with herbs that may tend to crackle apart. The trays can be a little tough to clean, but generally nothing that your average dishwasher can't handle.I have also used my dehydrator to dry vegetables, and banana chips. All in all I think its a great price to see if you enjoy making dehydrated foods. I have not used this machine to make yogurt, but I think it would be a bit cumbersome to make yogurt in this. But a couple of round of beef jerky and you have more than paid for this machine!"
2,Not the best,"The Ronco does work, however, it is very hard to clean. The healting element is not protected, it is ambient heat not forced air. I like the other types better because of the forced air/good circulation and ease of cleaning."
4,Do you like beef jerky?,"Beef jerky is a protein rich snack that is perfect for hiking, biking, or just plain snacking. Store bought brands can run you $5.99 for a 4 oz. pouch. Making it yourself with the Ronco FD5 Food Dehydrator will cost half the price and you can control the flavors & tastes that you prefer. Experiment with different levels of pepper flavors or even some with honey flavor. It,s fun and it,s inexpensive and this machine works very easily and very well. If you like beef jerky, definately check it out."
2,Ronco Food Dehydrator Standard,"I really wish I did not buy this item , as it is so time consuming upgrading is mandatory to get any decent results.I would highly suggest buying the upgraded model with fan and bypassing this one."
1,1st product review; durability not function,"Well, got my unit last night and open it to find two of the five trays had shattered, presumably during shipment. I was surprised as the shipping box showed no signs of crush or other damage. I requested a replace ment and shall review the next units condition as well as, hopefully, its function."
2,Takes too long,If I could do it over again I would buy a dehydrator with an internal fan. This one generates very little heat and takes days. I could have used sunlight instead! The finished product came out fine as long as you don't mind constantly rotating the trays.
2,It will only last for a few uses,Trays are way too fragile. I bought this and used it about 5 times before one tray cracked and broke due to the heat. Trays are made from cheap plastic and break easily.
1,Ronco won't stand behind their product,"I have a Ronco food dehyerator that the heating element has gone on steroids & has melted 2 of the plastic trays. I called Ronco & unless I bought it directly thru them, they refused to do anything about their product. I was shocked and said ""you mean you won't back up the product you made"". Their response was ""Unless you purchased it thru us directly, I won't be able to help you"".I own 7 dehydrators and until today would have reccomended the Ronco. I teach dehydration classes! My opinion of the company has just plumeted! This STINKS!"
1,DONT BUY THIS UNIT.,From 1st use it smells of burning plastic. Make the food taste like plastic. There is no fan and this unit takes forever to dry even fruit... DONT BUY THIS UNIT. try a different brand. I cant believe they can still sell this
2,Cooks more than dehydrates.,Just was not as simple as it looked on TV. My fruits look more cooked than dried.
2,Ronco FD5 - bad trays,"I received the dehydrator as a Christmas gift and loved it. However, after only one month of continuous use, the trays began to break. I love dehydrating foods and am going to purchase another but not the Ronco. I would have to purchase the trays at $2.00 each and since they seem to last only a month with continuous use, the replacement cost over time would exceed the cost of purchasing a new one."
2,Trays melt under the dehydrator's heat!!,"It works fine (given that it is convection based), but I'm surprised that the trays have melted only after a few uses! I would recommend buying one that has a thermostat so you won't burn some soft foods. The trays are cheap plastic in this one. They easily crack and mine melted at several spots :-oHaving found a few favorite items to dehydrate, I'm planning to get one with a fan and a thermostat for even and controlled dehydration."
4,"Better than OK, but not great","Got this for my wife and we have used to to dry mainly herbs and flowers and things for decorations. It puts off a lot of heat but the lack of a fan makes it uneven. I added a computer case fan to the bottom and that helps a lot. Point is, you shouldn't have to do that."
1,Ronco is a Joke-o,"This is without a doubt the bottom of the line food dehydrator. A friend bought one of these because it was so inexpensive, but it turns out it was just CHEAP. This thing doesn't work in the most generous sense of the word. Without a fan, even if you constantly rotate the trays, the food doesn't dry evenly. I own an Excalibur dehydrator and that's the way to go. I gave this product a rating of 1 only because there wasn't a choice for a lower number. The actual rating is much closer to zero."
2,it's not bad,"The a105-s2101 is not a bad notebook. Dvd playback is beautiful, It handles most of the things I want to do. Gaming is a little hit or miss, World of warcraft is a little jerky but guild wars plays well. The problem with this laptop is support, The display and chip set driver for this laptop is over a year old and if you know a little about computers up to date drivers are a must.I have tried to download and install the drivers from ATI, but toshiba has made it so that you can only install drivers that they post on their website . In effect locking you out of your own computer. So I don't recommend this or any toshiba laptop because of the lack of updates for their hardware (that you can only get from them) and for basically locking me out of my computer."
4,well worth the money,bought this auto dimming mask for my son. he is taking welding a half day at college. he loves it. now he can see where to start a bead.
4,Good item,"Fast delivery. It is not easy to find a local locksmith for key cutting with reasonable price. They want to sell me both key cutting service and a same key in >$100. Finally got a free key cutting from HomeDepot, then I programmed the key by following the instruction sent with this item. Now the new key works to my 2007 Rav4. If this item was a little less expensive, I should give a five star rating."
4,Nothin' wrong with a little fun!,"This ain't Dr. Dre or Mos Def, and it ain't supposed to be. The rapping is absolutely ludicrous, but it made me laugh out loud back then and it still makes me smile. Of course the music is the Madonna hit...so you know that's bumpin'...all in all, it's worth owning if you're a pop music collector."
5,a classic! get it if you can find it...,"This have been out of print for over 10 years, but the classics like ""Sovereign"" and ""Ride on Kind Jesus"", make this a collectors item.[...]"
5,My new favorite!,"I read this book to my 21 month old grandson this last week during a visit. I fell in love with it and he seemed to enjoy it very much as well. It was the one book he brought to me to read time and again. I love the illustrations...they evoke a time and place I wish were still with us, but, sadly, I don't think we will ever see the likes of war-time England again (or the likes of war-time English people as well as Americans....""What? Us sacrifice?!!!""). Anyway, what a lovely, lovely book. I highly recommend it to all."
3,Not Good Enough,"Gazebo,Man of many faces and voices of the Italio Disco era. Looking for the org. 12"" mix? Keep looking!It's not here. Trust me."
3,NO LONGER VERSION,"Masterpiece 5:13Masterpiece (12"" Remix)5:28Dolce Vita (12"" Remix) 6:40I Like Chopin (12"" Remix)8:54"
5,Excellent documentary about the financial disaster of 2008,"This is an excellent documentary that fully covers the cause of the collapse of five financial institutions in 2008. The non-regulation of credit default swaps, derivatives, and CDO's was the worst decision in history."
1,Produced by the DNC,"This PBS production is such a one sided view of what happened. Not one interview with a Republican, whereas Democrats Barney Frank and Chris Dodd, two of the people most responsible for the meltdown are depicted as heroes. I find it amazing that two of the people (Bernacke and Guitner), who this film says failed to fathom the depth of the meltdown, are now part of Obama's financial team. Hmmmmmm"
1,horrible,this product is a waste of your time and money it worked the first time and that's all the second time i tried it just stopped working and the usb attachment that goes into the controller came loose and pushed back into the battery this is a very poorly made product im glad i only bought it because i had left over money but if you have better things to spend your money on i would advise you do that
4,Dubbing much Worse than Subtitled Version,"As another reviewer said, they have taken out the song at the end of each episode (nor did they bother to sing it in English, they merely left the words out).I was at a convention when I bought this and I realized too late I had gotten a Dubbed version.All of the original blood, gore, etc. is still there, but with the annoying high pitched voice of the girl, and the dead-pan voice over of Kenshiro, I am looking forward to putting this to a fire and getting myself the Subbed version. I suggest you do the same..."
1,"Crummy art, unfunny story, crummy printing","I am baffled by positive reviews of this Manga.It's not funny, and it's not sexy. Without those, what is the point? The drawing are crude old-old school manga. Very caricatured character designs, little detail or background.To make matters worse, the printing by RaiJin is crummy. Many spots are blank with no ink. It looks like it was messed up when they were doing the touch-ups.Save your money."
4,"very cute, simple design","I am a graphic designer and didn't want an over-the-top cutesy baby book full of crazy cartoons or stock illustrations. This baby book is very elegant and still adorably cute. The pages are designed in the same colors as the front cover, but with simple illustrations that put the focus on your baby's information instead of some coloring-book type illustrations. I only wish it had some pages with envelopments to hold items such as hospital bracelets, etc. But overall I would definitely recommend it!"
5,Excellent UY Book!,"A 'must' for all long-eared samurai fans! Very good stories, especially story about Kitsune roots. And art, of course, is Sakai's norm: very, very good!"
4,untitled,"i would reccommend it, but if you like surprises DON'T GET IT. there are A LOT of things you would never expect. but there are a lot of unanswered questions in here, but i guess these people can't figure them out. i know i can't"
3,"Okay book, but too many unanswered questions","(I would really give this book a 3.5, but there are no half stars.) While this book did have some interesting theories about the mysteries surrounding the Harry Potter septology, the one thing I didn't like about it was that the authors asked a lot of questions, but never answered them! Also, some of the secrets divulged were things I already read about on websites devoted to the HP books. This is not to say that this book is not worth reading. Quite the contrary, this book is easy to read and a handy companion for the HP books. If you are looking for a deeper literary interpretation of the HP books this is not the book for you. But if you want a fun companion guide to the HP septology, this is a great book to have. I would say that this would make a great gift for kids (5th grade & higher) or adults who love the HP books."
3,Not too bad. Not too good.,"Both the writing and thinking styles are too flippant with the language and tone more fitting for a DJ or a chat-room maniac. While a lot of smaller details are given a sometimes undeserved attention, there is no real depth involved in characters studies, in their motivations or actions/dialogs subtleties.Some important facts and even characters are completely overlooked (e.g. the boa-constrictor's possible future role).In the same time some of the authors' resulting theories (such as the whole Potter-is-Lupin mania) are not only weird but also presented as undisputable axioms.The obvious simplistic pro-Gryffindoric orientation is also irritating for an open-minded person.Not to mention the cheap publishing trick of huge amount of empty or almost empty spaces."
5,Excellent read for serious HP fans,"This book was wonderful, detailed, and thought provoking. The theories are intriguing. And the rules they provide to keep in mind while reading HP are absolutely right. This has been a nice read to keep me occupied while I wait anxiously for Order of the Phoenix. It is highly recommended, and I hope to see a sequel analyzing Order of the Phoenix sometime in the future."
3,sort of good. . .,"I think this book is sort of useful, but the writers overlooked many things, such as they do not know who the Ravenclaw ghost is, even though she (I know that the ghost is a she) is mentioned in one of the books. I find some things they think in the book knid of stupid, too. Overall, I don't think you should use it as a guide to Harry Potter, just something to entertain yourself with."
4,Fantastic,"I tabbed, wrote all over, and basically mutilated this book waiting on pins and needles for Order of the Phoenix. There were so many things I had never noticed before. The book summerizes each chapter, then analyzes it.After reading Order of the Phoenix, I went back to see what they had predicted correctly and all. While reading Book 5, I began to wonder if JKR had actually read this book! Some ideas in this book were right on, and others were off.I dislike the Lupin-Is-Really-James-Potter theory, and they make it clear that it just HAS to be true, so that's why I've given this book 4 stars instead of 5.It's very handy, and very helpful. I can't wait for an analysis of Book 5 to be published."
4,Learn MANY Things,"Although I already knew most of the things they told me in this book, I still picked up a lot. The author of this book did a great job picking up clues and running bits along with small details J.K. herself put in that are so small, I doubt anyone would have picked them up the first few times reading them."
4,Pretty good review of Book 4,"This is a good book by author Galadriel Waters of the first four books in the series. If you need a review of books 1 to 4, this book will help. After reading Water's general guide, I personally liked reading the new ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HARRY POTTER TRIVIA HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence since it covered all six books in the JKR series and served as a great refresher to reading HBP. I suggest to HP fans to read this guide for an overview and then immediately read the UNOFFICIAL HARRY POTTER HBP TRIVIA BOOK by Daniel Lawrence to get a more detailed insight into JKR."
2,badly edited,"There are some interesting classical references, and some good information about character names (and how they often differ in the French versions). But the writing style is an extremely annoying chatroom-ese (i.e., ""tee hee"" - so you'll know when something's meant to be funny- or ""Not!"" to indicate sarcasm) the authors have an agenda (Gilderoy Lockhart and Professor Flitwick both homosexual? I don't think so - and is this relevant in a children's book?) and we are assured that Sirius Black isn't ""phased"" by Voldemort's power. Too much mention of a possible numerological theme that is never really justified.Wait for June."
2,Dry and boring,"The only practical use I can find for this is to play Harry Potter trivia with friends. If you're a hardcore fan of the series, you already know all this, and speculation as to what MIGHT happen in the next series is a spoiler for some readers. Read the realies instead."
5,Russian Literature,"A master short story writer, Nagibin's tales are not only a tight history of childhood and young adult life in mid-twentieth century Russia, but also a universal perpsective of anybody who experienced and participated in those years. His characters can be any one of us, odd, comical, Chekovian. Sometimes you feel as if you are reading about people you know. I would also recommend the film Dursu Uzala, a brilliant screenplay by Yuri Nagibin, that showcases his empathy for life."
1,"Suzie's Flatbread, Corn Sesame, 4.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12) (Grocery)","10/30/2010Suzie's Flatbread, Corn Sesame, 4.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)I purchase 2 boxes 12 packs in each box I open the first box and the cracker smells very badI need to returned it to AmazonI think Amazon should inspect food items before sale to the publicKOBI, NY"
4,Good... but broken,"These ""crackers"" are great with soup. My whole family loves them and they are a great deal on Amazon compared to buying them in the store. My only complaint is that there were at least 4 or 5 broken pieces in each package. The packaging is not designed to protect the product from shipping damage."
5,Not a better set of 1/2 router bits for the price,This is a great set of bits at a great price. It has a wide selection of quality bits that have provided very clean cuts. The case also provides a great way of storing the bits
4,"Case is Kinda chincy, but bits work great so far",The case is a bit on the cheap side but holds the bits in an orderly fashion almost too well as I don't like fighting with a sharp router bit trying to pull it from the case. tHe bit selection is great for the price and cuts well.
