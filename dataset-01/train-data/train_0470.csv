3,So bad it's funny,"After a really promising opening, this movie devolves into the most ludicrous video game imaginable--with endless bad guys that attack in ""difficulty levels"" and impossible reappearances of villains. The dialogue is perhaps the worst on record, and I've seen Waterworld AND the Island of Dr. Moreau. It's bad bad bad. Go with a huge group of friends & then go out to laugh and shake your heads. This is how bad it is: the French play a prominent role as law enforcement!"
5,All action with a story included,"I went into watching this movie with no knowledge of what it was about. I ended up in the end of it loving it. This movie is an ""all action"" flick with a story included. Actually it isn't just one story, it is a couple of them. The stunts in this movie and the special effects is outstanding. If you like action flicks, you will love this one. I recommend this movie to anyone that loves action flicks and is a Jason Stantham fan as well. BTW, he does have his shirt off in a couple of scenes in this one."
3,Delivery Edition,I enjoyed this movie as a fun action movie. I was hoping for more in the special delivery edition. The extended scenes are just rough cuts in editing and dont so that much more. If you own the first one you are not going to find anything that much more in this edition. If you enjoy a good action movie with an easy plot is a great film
3,Action movie for video game youth,"This movie is so preposterous, you have no choice but to suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride. None of it makes any sense. Every scene has it's own theme music. The hero suffers hundreds of kicks and punches, and dodges thousands of bullets, but never seems to run out of steam or even show more than a few scratches. The most hilarious fight takes place while everyone involved is covered in motor oil. The final big-rig chase which lasts at least 15 minutes was clearly shot on the same 200 yard section of roadway (over and over again). Too bad it wasn't rated R. Then at least there would have been some good T&A."
1,One star fails to do this movie justice,"Zero or 1/3 of a star would be more appropriate. This movie is absolute garbage. Junk. Terrible plot, bogus kung-fu fight scenes, lousy characters, ... Car chase scenes were unconvincing, and the oil wrestling/fight scene was ludicrous. It was so unbelievably bad I watched it twice.See it and weep!"
4,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!!!!!,I think that this is a great movie. It is an action packed adventure movie that is kinda similiar to XXX. Jason Statham is really good in this movie. It may get kinda slow sometimes but thats o.k. A very fun movie. I cant wait until Transporter 2!!!!
3,Good action flick.,"An Ex-Military man Frank Martin (Jason Statham) aka The Transporter makes a living by hiring himself out to transport goods from one place to another. No questions asked. Frank's newest job appears no different from any others he's done in the past. This time though, he breaks one of his own rules by looking inside the package. After he has dropped the package off, the people who hired him realize that he knows too much and they want him dead."
3,Doesn't transport you anywhere,"I had read reviews that this was one of the greatest action movies of the year, hardly.Unfortunatley this recycled and at some times slow effort (even at the short running time of 90 minutes) just seems to never get going.Despite the cool cars, cool lead actor and actress, The Transporter doesn't seem to transport us anywhere.The villan is goofy and not even that scary.I was impressed with the fight scenes and the kung-fu style fighting. Which seemed a little weired considering the guy is supposed to be from France.If you've seen classic movies like The French Connection, or even more recent one's like The Bourne Identity, then you will be dissapointed by this effort.The DVD is also not exciting at all.Very minimal extras. They don't even give you the standard ""Cast & Crew"" section that tells you about the stars in front and behind the camera.Over all, not a terrible effort, but nothing great either. Same goes for the DVD."
3,Nothing Special but not all that bad.,"In the end all martial arts action movies are all the same but unlike most jackie chan and chuck norris movies this one doesnt [dive] but it really doesnt bring much to the table also. Statham plays the transporter who follows his very own set of strict rules but he eventually has to break them as a young women he unknowingly discovers he's transporting brings him into some trouble with some..well im not really sure if they were mafia,or gangsters or just some guys but it's not really important.anywho the opening car chase is pretty good and the fight scenes are highly entertaining. A movie similar to this one but better is the big hit with mark whalberg, a great action movie spliced in with comedy...which is usually a bad combo but this one was done very well."
3,Wow.....those British know how to drive.,"This is the first film of the Transporter duo. I only gave it a 3 because to be honest, the second Transporter movie is a lot better. The Transporter is a man who delivers 'ANYTHING' for a price. In film one, it turns out to be a girl wrapped up in a package. He usually doesn't look at his deliveries but he ends up getting involved with the vietnamies girl and eventually finds out that her father is loading up his people and bringing them into the country for cheap labor. The main character is called the transporter because not only does he deliver packages, he drives unbelievably. He can get out of any situation it seems. Superman without the cape."
3,Decent but nonsensical,"As you might expect, a film about a hard-hitting kung fu driver for organized crime goes much heavier on the chopsocky than on characterization or plot. Most perplexingly, the movie never explains why the woman in the ""package"" is there. The mystery deepens when we learn whose relative she is. It just doesn't make sense that she's getting carted around in the Transporter's trunk. Of course, the actual reason is ""it's in the script,"" and she is simply the MacGuffin.Ultimately, Statham's likeability and kung fu skill, and the fact that this film keeps moving, are its saving graces. If you are in the mood for some action, and you're willing to just roll with the movie rather than think about it too much, this is at least worth a rent. It's the kind of movie you would want to watch if you're at home sick from work with the flu."
2,Not good,Watchable and that's it. Nothing more or nothing less. If you have 90 minutes to waste this is the ideal movie. Rent but do not buy.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Transporter:Reasonably enjoyable, if completely forgettable, The Transporter rides on the charm of lead Jason Statham and delivers pretty much what could be expected from its bare-bones plot."
3,Seen worse,"Well this was entertaining, you can't deny that, and in various parts of the film there were some subtle moments between the action sequences.It only just merits 3 stars for me. Jason Statham is not a great actor, but as Frank he does this part as well as I've seen him do anything. The actor who played the French Police Inspector was by far the best thing on the screen.So its certainly a 'high-octane' thriller, and in places it doesn't take itself entirely seriously (which I like). However this is not in the same league as say the original Die Hard. Rent it first or buy cheap, as you may be dissappointed."
2,Lacking Vital Info in Description,"I was super excited to get this, because I'm building my Statham digital and special dvd's collection. Everything seemed fine until I couldn't download the digital copy because iTunes wouldn't honor the code...why you ask? I had to read the fine print on the digital copy info sheet included in with the discs. there was a notation that YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD THE DIGITAL COPY ANYMORE CAUSE IT EXPIRED 2 YEARS AGO!!!!! So the only salvageable portion was disc 2 with the Statham commentary and extras. So I am NOT thrilled with my purchase."
4,A very good action movie with amazing fights and car chase scenes,The Transporter is a very good action movie with amazing fight and car chase scenes. The actor really knows how to kick some butt in the movies he makes. What I desire to know was if he did his own stunts fighting wise and the car chase scenes? But if your into a great action film mixed with power fight scenes and lot of good car chase scenes then pick this movie up and be ready to be amazed by the job this actor does for his action movies. That is the main reason I watch any of his movies just for the fight scenes.
5,Very good action movie!,"I bought this movie off of the shelf the first day it came out because i knew it would be worth owning just by the trailer. All and all it was a very good movie, but every once in while you would see some shots in sort of a different tint or something. But other than that it was a great action flick and Jason Statham did a great job and I hope to see him in more movies because he has great potential to make up with the some of the best. He did great fight scenes and a great badass attitude. I definatley recommend to anybody who is in the mood for a good action movie"
4,What a fun movie!,"Jason Statham is the Transporter. For the right price he will deliver your package wherever it is supposed to go, no questions asked. Unfortunately he makes the cardinal mistake one day and finds out what the package is. His employers take exception to this and the action/adventure slugfest is running at full speed.This movie has a mediocre plot (the romance that blossoms and the immigrant storyline is somewhat cheesy) that is quite simply saved by the impressive direction and choreography of the action. I have previously seen Statham only in supporting roles but here he proves that he has the ability to carry an action lead. Sure, the character is the familiar quiet man who doesn't want to be pushed, but when push comes to shove he is more than able to deliver.I found the movie to be well shot, extremely stylish, and somewhat substantive. If anything, it was the best action rush in awhile at the theater."
2,thin,"If you like chase scenes, fight scenes, beefcake and the thinnest excuse for a storyline, this movie's for you!"
4,Great Action Film,"This movie doesn't have the best story line but the action and fight scenes are top notch, not to mention I have a huge crush on Jason Statham."
1,Are you kidding me?,"There are plot holes big enough to drive a black BMW through in this film! Sure, the butt-kicking scenes are fun, .... I agree that the leads, especially Mr. Statham, should become big stars, but they're going to need much better material than this to do the job."
1,it's like a train wreck,"this is one of those movies that i watched more than once because i couldn't believe how bad it was. it was like a train wreck... i couldn't look away no matter how terrible it was. the premise is cool. but, the plot, dialogue, acting, directing... all sucked something fierce. i found myself asking ""why this is a movie?"". after the opening scene, where Statham's character is defined, the plot begins, i guess. if you have two brain cells to rub together, you'll ask why the series of events ever took place. they just don't make sense. packages are delivered, Matt Schulze sexual orientation is questioned, guns go bang, cars are destroyed, chinese are liberated from a shipping container, good guys-1 bad guys-0, credits roll and i die a little inside."
3,Mindless Hilarity,"Not a movie for anyone looking for any kind of depth in the plot or characters. Full of ridiculous car chases, hilarious action scenes, and unrealistic characters, The Transporter offers an hour and a half of mindless escape from reality and routine."
1,A good 'return' experience,"Unfortunately I had to return this product because it was a UMD - universal media device - which didn't play on my DVD player. However, I was very impressed with GoHastings' customer service in handling the return and credit. I have bought many items from this seller and have never been disappointed."
2,Nothing special here,"The trailer for the second one had me interested. So I decided to rent this. It's your typical PG-13 movie with lots of explosions. It's like some of the latter, bad Bond movies. Yet this movie even gets this special DVD. Why may I ask? It was lame, and the fight scenes were so unrealistic and over the top that they weren't even fun. On top of that, the fights weren't well made. And it's the action that should make or break a movie like this. And here, it clearly breaks it.Mediocre at best, don't ""transport"" this DVD home.And what a shame, co-written by the wonderful Luc Besson. This had me thinking: this guy's slipping. That's too bad.The acting is fair but more mediocre than good and the love story thrown in a la James Bond is random, pointless and stupid. I hate it when they do that for action movies. But love story or not, this movie isn't worth or rental or a sequel."
1,Really bad.,"Another typical, senselessly violent pseudo-action flick. The acting is okay, albeit nothing to shout from the rooftops. The plot is as thin as as a triscuit, and the score? Holy cheese whiz, the score. One of THE worst soundtracks I have heard on film in the past decade. Regardless if I enjoyed the music or not (which I didn't), the soundtrack is supposed to fit the scene. Here on the great ""Transporter"", the music is way out on left field. And what's with all the 'XXX' comparisons? That movie was at least good for a laugh."
4,Mindless Fun,"You had one of those terrible weeks - traveling all over the country. Alas, you return to homebase in time for the Friday unwind. Get home, crack open a Heineken, fire up the home theatre and pop in The Transporter. If you were observant enough to take in the cover (man floating through air, BOTH guns ready) you know what's in store for your viewing pleasure. You won't be disappointed.However, if you need dose of sober reality you might want to move on. May I suggest The Killing Fields or Requiem for a Dream to go with your herbal tea? We all need our cerebral stimulation, but The Transporter won't fit the bill.Oh, and if your date (or spouse) happens to be into BMWs, she might enjoy it as well."
2,Rule #4 Don't open the DVD case....,"Transporter was recommended to me by a friend and I purchased it in a two-pack with Fight Club. My expectations were not high, but I was not prepared for the film that would unfold.As far as the action sequences and the cinematography go the film is fine, but as far as plot and dialogue go this is a major yawner.The opening car chase is great, but the film never really matches the thrills of its beginnings. I also think that Memento was an easier plot to follow. The plot never really made any sense to me...my family is being smuggled....just kidding, my father is the one doing the smuggling....whatever....Save your $$ and either rent it & watch with the lights and your brain off or just go watch something else."
3,Not bad...You've just got to know what to expect,"I have read a number of the reviews for this paticular movie and I think it is important to remember the type of movie in question. This is a fairly good action movie.Sure, I had some issues with the soundtrack but I didn't find it distracting.Ok, the fight scene ratio of fifteen bad guys to one good guy can, at times, seem a little over-the-top.However, if you are in the mood for an action film with exoctic locations, well-above-average car chases, and thought-provoking fight scenes, then you should enjoy this movie."
3,"Good movie, but disappointing","""The Transporter"" had me entertained right up until the ending, which was a horrible way to end the movie. For those of you who haven't seen it, though, I won't tell you the ending. Other than that, pretty ... good."
2,Good action but plotless movie with an annoying Asian Chick,"I got this at Blockbuster today and I like the first 35 min of this movie. Jason looks like a real professional when he wears his black suits and drives his BMW 735. He's acting cool and I like it. However, things turn bad as soon as he opens the bag carrying ex-Taiwanese pornstar Shu Qi. I still don't have a clue why she is in the bag the first place. Isn't she the daughter of the evil ugly Chinese man? Her screaming is just too annoying and I must admit that her English is just as bad as me.The action is quite good except that it's over-done in some secens like in the bus."
2,2 stars for...,"I give 2 stars to this movie. One is for the acting I found not so bad and the second one is for the fight scenes I found quite creative. Now let me tell you that the story is bad with many and many impossibilities. It's dumb and you know it as soon as you watch the first 5 minutes in the movie. Jason Statham manages the whole thing not to look like an idiot and he succeeds. The French cop is a talented French actor and it helps too. This movie is the perfect example of the very bad script produced by good money. Thanks to Luc Besson. Conclusion : Watch this movie if you like Vandamme style, action + action = action (it's the formula) and if you like not to think while watching."
1,"I Wanted It To Be Good, But...","Y'know...I wanted this to be a good film. I really did. The general idea was a good one and I liked the main character, but there were too many predictable scenes. And the ones that were a surprise made absolutely no sense."
1,"""B"" grade Asian actors","As stated in the other reviews, this movie has no plot, but does have constant action. However, the two main Asian actors must be ""b"" list retreads. The daughter's voice has the most annoying whine and the father should have at least gotten his teeth whitened before they made the movie. As far as the action, I thought xXx was bad, but this movie was far worse."
1,Horrible Movie,"If all you want is some cool getaway scenes and bad figting scenes than buy this DVD, otherwise forget it. Music gets a mixed review. The score is o.k. and granted has a few good pieces but at times the music was played at the wrong time as when the transporter and the girl swim away from their house. Overall the director did a poor job sending The Transporter down with Titanic."
3,The Transporter,"The transporter is a relatively good movie, but it has it's flaws. it is full of action and you can watch it time and time again, but it is not realistic and definitely not worth buying."
5,AWESOME!!,"This is one of my favorite movies! It came quick and I was able to complete my Transporter collection at a reasonable price! The s&h price was kinda high, but I guess in the end it was worth it."
3,Statham makes the movie,"The Transporter began a series of over-the-top action movies starring Jason Statham. If you are like me, this has been a positive development. While I feel that Statham is a fine actor who could do more serious work (and did in The Bank Job), he is able to elevate these implausible action movies to a level they may not deserve. The Transporter is a straightforward action movie and features some creative fights.The Blu-Ray is a mixed bag. The transfer isn't bad and it sounded great on my system, but there are little extras. There is a commentary featuring Statham - I haven't listened to that yet, but will probably give it a shot. Other than that, the only special features are trailers.Given that they are coming out with a third Transporter, it may be worth holding off on these films as I would guess a double-dip is on the way."
4,Action!,"I'm not usually a fan of many pure action films, so this one is particularly good. Jason Stratham has the action hero part down perfectly, suitably tough but not ridiculously so(a la Vin Diesel). The action seqeunces are well done, although some of the extended action footage would have been better in the film, rather than appearing as deleted scenes. A lot of fun to watch, wish I had seen it in the theater."
2,Laughable,"Typical action laff-mobile that goes from bad to worse. Starts out with Stetham as the man in control, he quickly becomes a vehicle for kung fu action. Avoid this dud."
3,so so so so so so so so,"Ok, it's good some great camera shots, very good fighting sequences, and some pretty miserable acting. But it's also got the generic, perpetually-clad-in-Armani bad guy who's conveniently a martial-arts expert (he's also young a rich, go figure)to make it fun. I must say that if it it weren't for the beautiful young lady I'd have taken more trips to the fridge. Overall entertaining if you can stand looking at that ridiculous chinese guy's face."
4,All about modems,Read this book if you want to learn about how modems work and everything about modems...
1,Never received it...,"Because the shipping company (DHL) only tried ONCE to deliver it and never left a note or anything. Said no one was home...Hmmm? I WAS home, out on the front patio firing up one of my smokers. Won't (knowingly) ever do any business with any company that uses DHL as part of their delivery network."
4,Interesting reading....,Interesting concepts. I liked the emphasis on not having to attempt a diet change cold turkey but gradually incorporating changes in ones eating habits.
2,Oh dear...,"Urgh, I tried REALLY hard to get in to this album. but, alas, its REVOLTING. Neither of the vocalists are capable of making a pleasant noise! That's what really lets this album down becasue otherwise the rest of the band are fine. It has the potential to sound really good... if the vocalists were different.actually, George (or whatever his name is) sounds fine when he is screaming but most of the time, he just grunts.. and he sounds awful.Musically, their sound is quite original, the guitars sound quite harsh, not smooth at all, always hammering some sort of riff. I was told that they sound like early Within Temptation.. but they don't at all in the slightest!I was throughly disappointed with this album, i tried to listen to it with an open mind, but to be honest, I can't listen to it without feeling utterly revolted."
4,Easy and very thorough,"I have ordered all three levels of the Pimsleur French courses through Amazon, and for me, it couldn't be easier. I was taking a French conversation course at the same time in college, and I learned much faster with the Pimsleur method. I listen to the CDs on my early morning walks, while I'm on my bicycle, and in the car to and from work - so I hear and speak French about 2 hours daily. The French III Comprehensive has made it much easier to hear the language as it is spoken in French films (though I struggle with some of the idiomatic expressions), and I can participate eagerly in my French Club with the more advanced French speakers. If you're on a budget, it's great to be able to sell the program through Amazon, when you have completed the course, as I have done. I would give the product five stars but Pimsleur doesn't include a readers manual, only a reference guide. I've listened to other French instruction programs, but I kept returning to Pimsleur."
1,Disappointed,"I had been doing Penton Overseas Learn in Your Car series for over a year when I decided to give Pimsleur a try. At first I thought the conversational nature of the lessons was a real plus. But then I realized how very little new vocabulary I was actually being introduced to me. After going through French III and then French Plus, I have to say that I was disappointed. Purchase of the program was reimbursed to me as part of my work, so I wasn't upset by the purchase. Still, it made me wish for more lessons (i.e., a Level IV) for the Penton French series. I have since gone back to Penton and now use Rosetta Stone for more extensive learning."
4,One Method of Many,"I started with the first edition of French about 4 months ago, and I am now almost through the first 60 lessons, which is French 1 and 2. While I have made many strides, I would not recommend that you ""only"" use Pimsleur to learn French. I started with Pimsluer, and I also have a French grammar workbook, a phrase book, and I take 2 private classes a week with a native french speaker. I will also be heading to France in 2 weeks to study and improve there. I still have a long way to go, but I will only get better."
4,The best Program to brush up your French,I find French III 2nd Ed.LEARN TO SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND FRENCH WITH PIMSLEUR LANGUAGE PROGRAMS the best way to brush up your foreign language.However the subject matters covered could have been broader.
1,You Will Never Become Fluent Using This Product,"I think the 4 star reviews put a very positive spin on this product. The reason why it has no written script is because they don't want to highlight the fact that you will go through multiple 30 minute lessons to learn one full conversation. There is very little material here as things are constantly repeated. And it is not okay to pay this much money and be barely a beginner after all the time invested (90 lessons!). It's a great product - for $29.95. But it isn't for the serious french student who wants to, I don't know READ as well as speak french fluently. Get it from the library for free. I did thank God."
1,"DMD board died, can't get a replacement","This was a great product when it worked. But my DMD board recently went out on it and the part is no longer available. SamsungParts.com said a ""substitute"" part was available for $[...], but it wouldn't make sense to put that much into old technology compared to what's out today for not much more.I'm posting this for those who may be looking at buying one of these used from someone. If you can get a great deal fine, but keep in mind that you may not be able to get parts for it. You can still get lamps, but some other parts are no longer available. Also keep in mind that the tuners built in are standard definition, not HD. You need an external HD source to get HD on this unit."
3,Inexplicable voice smothered by unfavourable settings.,"Anyone warming a well-appointed chamber in their heart for 'Elis and Tom', Antonio Carlos Jobim's desafinitive collaboration with the singer (what an inadequate word) Elis Regina may find the latter's 'Vento De Maio' album very disappointing. It's not that the songs are bad - some of them are very beautiful, echoing with strange, often folk-dark, Brazilian melodies, Elis' bird-restless voice dodging the mysterious mood- and tempo-changes. But the whole thing is an early example of rycooderfication - all native eccentricities are ironed out by superslick production and anonymously proficient session-playing. A few of songs survive the process - 'Tiro Ao Alvaro' (Hit the Bull's Eye) equals anyting on the Jobim album, a joyous, rasping busk; 'So Deus E Quem Sabe' (God Only Knows) and 'O Que Foi Feito Devero' (What Was Really Done) lurk enigmatic vocal alleys; 'Outro Cais' (Another Pier) is a haunting miniature."
2,A Very Overrated Album,"I'm stunned that this album comes so favorably reviewed. Everything that initially attracts you to Elis Regina is absent on it. The compositions are all unmemorable and emanate pretentiousness (though, of course, I don't understand Portuguese), while the 70's jazz-rock band is noisy and dated in a way more embarrassing than quaint. Regina's voice is lost here. To put it plainly, there is nothing catchy, swinging or pretty on this album. I above all recommend above all ""Aquarela do Brasil"" and ""Elis and Tom"", then, after that, ""The Art of Elis Regina."""
5,Giorgio Brutini Demi Boots In The House,"I ordered a pair of these boots on Sunday eveining, and they arrived right on time on Wednesday afternoon, with free shipping!!! I was able to track them with my UPS tracking number, and was able to be at home when they arrived. I had them in time for the weekend, and that convinced me that I will definitely order from them again. I have the Gray, and I want at least three more colors. to match suits that I have. I had owned a pair several years ago, and loved them, but had been unable to find them in stores locally. They are sleek, slick, and add some serious flavor to the right suit or jeans. They are comfortable too. If you like snake skin boots, and feel comfortable with a half boot, I highly recommend trying these. You won't regret it."
3,"Nice looking, but ran small","The pair I received ran about a full size smaller than expected. The quality appeared to be good, but I could not get it on my foot."
5,Giorgio Brutini = Excellence,This is the third pair of snakeskin footwear that I have purchased from Giorgio Brutini and each purchase has provided me with unsurpassed style and craftsmanship. I love them and I receive numerous glowing compliments on the look. You cannot do better for either style or quality at this price point.
2,Why only one width size?,"10 D is too short, 10.5 D too loose and sloppy. Do you carry C or B widths? Like the style though."
1,"few mistakes in 7th Ed., but no better for it ...","I haven't noticed the mistakes the other reviewers have mentioned; perhaps they reviewed an earlier edition, or I haven't gotten far enough (through ch. 8). Anyway, the book is awful purely on account of the author's inability to make the concepts clear, and to use terminology precisely -- perhaps this fog is masking the errors. Fwiw, others in my class agree. Also, the index is uselessly short, so if you don't remember the meaning of some term defined in the text, you'll have to hunt for the imprecise definition page by page. In sum: unclear and difficult to use. Seek another alternative if at all possible."
1,This is a difficult book from which to teach yourself,"I'm a second year computer science student taking a course on probability, and this is the book we are using. Why, I don't know, because it's not a very good book. I'm not a note-taker, and have a difficult time paying attention in math classes, so I usually teach myself from the book. With a 3.6 GPA, I'd say it usually works. Not so with this book.This book lacks sufficient examples and the definitions and explanations of theorems are confusing. To its credit, it has odd answers in the back, but that's standard for math books. However, it lacks any answers to the review exercises at the end of each chapter, making the review exercises nearly worthless."
1,freaking piece of Sh**,"I'm a professional who works in the tech industry, and I'm pretty competent in Stats. I'm taking a Design of Experiments class this term for my masters program, and for whatever reason the instructor chose to use this book. It's utterly useless, piece of [literature]. The explanations are poor, no good examples, and NO ERRATA for a error-prone book!! I wonder if the authors paid instructors to use this book, because it's simple one of the worst books ever written. I'm sellign this junk right afterwards.. it's not even worth the shelf space... use it for toilet paper maybe!"
4,An Introduction to Modern Literature via Symbolism,"_Axel's Castle_ provides a wonderful introduction to modern literature and its sources in the Symbolist movement. However, the book is a bit uneven, and some writers garner more attention than others; Stein gets only about ten pages. It is clear that Wilson views Joyce and Proust as the two most significant modern writers, and those two chapters are accordingly the most insightful of the book and worth the price of the entire volume. In addition, the book will introduce most readers to the deservedly obscure Villiers de L'Isle Adam and may impel them to read _Axel_. Perhaps the latter volume will someday return to print now that Wilson's first work of literary criticism has finally done so. If you are at all interested in any of these authors or the Symbolist movement, this book is essential as Wilson is one of the foremost literary critics of the century, and this is perhaps his most representative and greatest work."
4,Insightful!,"I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as well as gender issues. This book was an interesting mix of the two, expounding on the gender messages in Buffy."
4,Thoughtful Presentation of the Case for Reformed Worship,"Before I read this book, I had a limited knowledge of Reformed theology. For me, the book was valuable for two reasons. First, it was a succinct and persuasive presentation of some of the key tenants of Reformed theology. Secondly, it was an excellent critique of the present-day way we do ""church."" While I didn't agree with every critique and alternative that was presented, each point was thoughtful and worthy of consideration. Any Christian that has participated in ""church"" has a sense that how do it is not quite right. This book gives an explanation of why that is and how we can change it. It is a welcome change to the program oriented, formulaic, and trendy methods used to popularize church. This book is an important read for all those that love the ""Church."""
3,Great book,"I love this book it helped me out so much. I only wish I could read it forever!! Also people should read ""The Color of Light: poems on Van Gough by McEntyre, Marilyn"
1,"""Me and My big Mouth"" by Joyce Meyer","I was extremely dissapointed, the second 15 pages were missing, otherwise the book was in good condition. I was not happy about it.Me and My Big Mouth"
2,Actual product not as pictured,"The product I received was actually a mini-book half the size of the pictured item. On the back of the mini-book was the price: $2.99, yet I was charged $8.69! Although I believe the contents were the same, I expected to receive a full-sized book like the one pictured, and I should have been charged a price commensurate with the product, which was not the case. In fact, I was overcharged."
3,"""Think before you speak & you've got the whole book.",I think this book is over-rated. Worrying that what you say is what you'll get is verynon-Biblical. She is putting God in a box. SM
4,Watch your mouth,"Well, Finally I bought this book and read it right through. The book gives us insights as to how we use our tongues for the good and bad both knowingly and unknowingly. It reflected the way I use my words to express sorrow, defeat and other negative things. It is true that we create our world with our words and we have to live in it. My best interest in the book was with the chapter Calling the things that are not. Read the book. you wont be disappointed"
5,Me and My Big Mouth!,"Great book, it was very informative and OH! so very true. Joyce Meyer is the greatest. A very profound visionary."
2,Would not purchase again. a disappointment,"I purchased this book to use as a part of a set for a group Bible study I was facilitating, but ended up not using it because it simply did not live up to the expectations I had for a Joyce Meyers publication. I would not buy again, and would definitely think twice about buying another Joyce Meyer teaching product."
5,GOD HAS BLESSED JOYCETO PASS WORDS OF WISDOM TO US,"I AM SO GRATEFUL TO GOD OUR FATHER FOR TOUCHING JOYCE MEYERS HEART TO RELEASE SUCH A POWERFUL BOOK INTO MY LIFE, IT HAS BEEN AN EXTREME HELP IN MY WALK TO THE FATHER AND I ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO LINE THEIR MOUTH UP WITH THE WORDS OF GOD THEN THIS IS A FOR SURE #1 BOOK TO READ. MAY GOD BLESS YOUTO READ AND PRACTICE THIS BOOK ,ESPECIALLY TO GET US TO OBEY THE BIBLE, THERE IS LIFE IN THE WORD...."
5,Non Fiction Bonfire of the Vanities for the New Millenium,"A great non fiction account of the rise, rise and fall of the boom market written with a novelist's eye for detail. Peppered with lively anecdotes and colorful commentary about the decade's leading financial figures, Mahar offers incisive analysis about what drove the boom and advice on how to survive the aftermath. What's more, BULL helps you take stock of your own portfolio. It was enormously helpful and an unexpectdly good read. I only put it down to share passages with my husband."
4,"Good, but superficial","I read this book because Warren Buffet recommended it. While it is an interesting read, it was written by a journalist, so it lacks insightful analysis or data. Nonetheless, it is an interesting overview of the people, institutions, and trends that defined the era, but the analysis a little superficial. I am reading John Kenneth Galbraith's ""The Great Crash"" right now, and it is a significant upgrade to this book when it comes to telling the story of a speculative bubble, but this is pretty much the only choice for the Tech bubble, so it is worth reading."
2,A different kind of love story,"I really wanted to love this book. I enjoyed her writing style and was pulled in by her unique and deeply honest experience, however, it got repetitive. I think it would make a great movie."
3,The unhappy wife of a prisoner,"I have read the prisoner's wife, and it breaks my heart to think that a educated woman such as asha could believe that being with a man in prison is a love story. I too am the wife of a prisoner, my son's father have been in prison for over 20 years. We have been married for over 12 years, the experience for me is anything but pleasant. Often times I am lonely and frustrated. And sometimes I have to pretend to be ""alright"", just to protect him, when really deep inside I am hurting, and need to be understood. Alot of people do not know that I am married.For me, saying that my husband is an inmate, is not anything to proud of. I think it is a shame for a woman, such as Asha, to put out in words that marrying someone in prison is ideal. Alot of men in prison our very selfish. They're in no position to be a husband."
5,It will make you reasses how well you love.,"The first lines of The Prisoner's Wife state that the story is a love story. Bandele's lyrical style made reading the book like reading an epic poem about pain, abuse, love and healing. The author's honesty and candor made her story one easy to relate to - even if you haven't ever endured long distance love or the prison system. The Prisoner's Wife is the most loving piece of lietrature that I have ver read. It made me appreciate the proximity and ease of my own relationships that I so often take for granted."
3,I kept waiting for the story to begin,"The Prisoner's Wife was an interesting and poignant memoir. Asha Bandele writes beautifully. I was mesmerized by the poetic flow of her words from the very beginning. However, I, like one of the other reviewers, believe that Ms. Bandele was so focused on the poetry that she failed to tell a complete story. I kept waiting for the real story to begin. I was looking for descriptions of her day-to-day experiences, what she did to cope with the lonliness, specific details of the beginnings of their relationship, how they came to fall in love in the first place. I wanted to truly understand Asha and what led her to become ""The Prisoners Wife""-- but the author never truly let us see her complete self. While she shared her painful past, the story seemed as if it had been written by an outside observer-- not the person who'd actually experienced the pain firsthand. As beautiful a story as it was, I think the soul of the story was missing."
3,The Prisoner's Wife,"It was hard for me to not be judgemental while reading this book. I just couldn't understand how a seemingly level-headed and intelligent young woman would fall in love with and then saddle herself with the burden of becoming the wife of an inmate. The writing was clear and eloquent, but I question the honesty. The author is adamant that her husband didn't manipulate the situation, but I don't buy it."
5,The Prisoner's Wife,This book was an excellent read. The writer paints a beautiful portrait of love on lock down. I felt her pain.
5,"A beautiful love story. Honest, Strong, Determined","I cannot in anyway compare myself to Asha. To her life situations. Although she is not a prisoner in an institution, she is a prisoner of it. I praise her for being able to tell her story and weather the storms. Faltering at times nevertheless bearing it and telling it.Rashid, the man of what all men should be. Able to face his mistakes and keep moving in a positive way without the hinderance of the past but with a stregnth from it. A man who is not ashamed to love. With the ability to accept love and give love in return.Asha: You keep loving Rashid. Your Man. Your Baby. Your King.Rashid: You keep loving Asha. Your Woman. Your Momi. Your Queen.May the strength of your love keep you and see you through to the end. If only we all could find a love like this. A stong unfailing love."
5,"Indeed, a must read.","What a great book. If you don't know someone in prison, this book will give you much to think about. She makes you understand. If you know someone in prison, this book touches home. No matter if it is someone you are in love with or a friend you care about, Asha has captured all of the emotion and thought that comes with incarceration. She meets a man...in prison...befriends him...comes to love him and eventually marries him...knowing he has 20 years to life in prison. This is a love story, asha bandele tells the reader that fact upfront. This book shows the reader love developing from a tiny seed into this fully blossomed flower, but exposes all of the little insects that may invade it, making it sick or even causing it to wither and die. Asha Bandele's words flow and pull you into her life and what she is experiencing. Indeed, a must read."
5,"Trememdous, emotional, and real.","The Prisoner's Wife was riveting! I went through every emotion with Asha. I had tears in my eyes as I read her words. I felt her happiness, her pain, and her pleasure. I couldn't put the book down. We can only hope but to experience love with this intensity."
5,"Powerful , moving story filled with emotions.","After reading this book I felt a sense of understanding that I too was not the only woman in the world going through this. I felt her pain and it felt as real as mine, even though there are some differences to what I am going through, it gave me a feeling a sense of place in this empty world and reasurance that what I am going through and will overcome."
5,Prisoner's Wife- Moving and Inspirational,Although the title of my review is a bit cliche this book made me cry. It's a true love story. You can feel the pain and triumph in this realtionship and it is a genuine portrait of love in the worst of circumstances.
2,Can adversity lead to peace?,"I did not like Prisoner's Wife and I did not dislike the book. While it had no redeeming message for me, I cannot say that Ms. Bandele's experience is invalid because it is not my experience.As I read, I kept a sad feeling because she appeared to be defined by so many negative life circumstances (ie, sex abuse, drug abuse, abortion, prison experiences, etc.) I guess she wanted to let the reader know her love for Mr. Rasheed was her empowerment, but, I could not tell if she found peace at the end of the book."
1,Spinning her wheels,"I did not enjoy this book. In my opinion, all the author did was share a story which should have been kept to herself. Black women writers, need to share stories which convey strength of conviction and hope for the future. Ms Bandele gives us neither. I am not condemning the life that she chose but the fact that it has been made public. A well educated Black woman who became an editor at Essence, is someone that most young Black girls would aspire to emulate, and they should. Professional Black personalities in entertainment, sports, enterprising business, etc. should accept that whether or not they choose to be, they are role models for less fortunate children of the ghetto. If this story at any time had given the reader emotional fullfillment or at least a sense of better days to come it would be worth the time and paper on which it is printed. This story is one which starts out hopeless and ends the same way. What was the point?"
3,A Hard Read,"This book was a hard read. It was a selection from my book club and everyone had a diffult time reading this. I thought that it was an interesting story but the writing was dull. I feel that Asha had alot of unresolved issues before she even met Rashid. She was not stable enough emotionally to be in a regular relationship let alone one with a prisoner. What really bothered me about this book is how she had this""poor me"" attitude when she talks about the conjugal visits. Well, whose fault is that? She CHOOSE to marry Rashid and to be in that difficult situation. I found it appalling that Asha would try to get sympathy from the readers about a decision that she made. In end, I felt sorry for her. I hope she gets some sort of counseling."
1,Hated it...,"The Prisoner's Wife: A Memoir is the first book that I have ever read that I can honestly say I hated. This is certainly not a book I would have chosen to read on my own - it was a book club choice and I had to suffer through it. I knew that I would not be a fan of the book's content, but I tried to keep an open mind. I felt that the author was so busy trying to paint a picture with her words that she actually forgot to tell us her story."
2,Screwed up writer...,"This book was nothing as I expected. I went in thinking that this was going to be a love story between a professional woman who worked at the prison, and happen to fall in love with a prisoner who was doing time for a small crime. Instead, it's a story about a writer, who had a messed up childhood, teenage years, and who currently has a screwed up adultlife. It was a story, to me, about a woman who is not happy with herself, and who has settled for anything, meaning, settling for someone doing major time for murder, and someone whom she may never get the opportunity to spend a ""real"" life with, outside of the prison walls. This book really was a waste of money, and I wouldn't recommend it at all. I just couldn't relate to the confused life of this Asha Bandele. Maybe she writes better magazine articles for Essence, but this book just wasn't cutting it."
2,"Smart woman, foolish choice","Asha Bandele writes in a beautiful, lyrical style that I fell in love with, however, I found her story to be one of ""poor me"": Poor me, my man's locked up, poor me I can't finish getting my freak on because the guards are at the door, poor me, I got pregnant and I'm broke. She did not once take responsibility for her choices, and talks over and over again about the fall out from her lack of judgement without ever examining WHY she lacks judgement or HOW she can make better choices. I wanted to pop her upside the head! I read the book to get insight as to how and why a woman would marry a convicted criminal while he was still behind bars, but I came away none the wiser. She has a beautiful voice, but it would be better served a more worthy story than this."
5,A story that transcends time...,"I initially read this book back in 2000 and loved it then, and have recently re-read it in anticipation of Asha's sequel to this work. I absolutely loved the way Asha weaves in so much of what she thinks and feels in each portion of the progession that she creates. It gives you deeper insight into how she could find herself in such a peculiar situation that ultimately leads her to a specific place in her destiny. This book is a must read for those who want to understand what it means to love someone without the boundaries of your reality, experiences, and past. Asha tells a moving story of two people who learn that love can truly transform us into more than we ever thought."
4,Truly a Moving Story,"I stayed up an entire night reading this book - I couldn't put it down. I can see she poured her soul in this book - it takes a very strong woman to make the choice she made to make her private life public. But I think what Asha did was give alot of women strength to cope with their own individual situations dealing with loved ones in prison. As she made it clear - it's always a whisper in the office, or any place else for that matter, when you don't want anyone to know you have a loved one imprisoned. Although many judged her - I read this book with an open mind and allowed Asha to carry me through her world. Feeling just about every emotion she felt. I can only say it takes a strong woman to make such an unpopular decision to marry a man in prison with very little hope of returning to society - really living her life on hope. This is the kind of book that keeps me wondering - I wonder what happen to their marriage now. This is a must read!"
4,Hauntingley Beautiful,"This author has a story that needs to be told especially in a country where the amount on governmental spending on education and incarceration are running neck in neck. It was fascinating to hear about the world of those who love people incarcerated and the things they encounter in and outside of the prison walls. Asha has some wonderful lines that you read over and over again because she is gifted in writing in metaphors of her love, lust and living experiences in general. It's fascinating how a prisoner has assisted her in freeing herself from her ugly past. It's a gem of a story."
4,Will make a believer out of all who read it.,"An outstanding memoir and love story, full of unflinching revelations that makes every word ring true. This is a tale of two hearts that have leapt barriers to forge a love that throbs with passion and devotion. Read it!"
3,To each her own,"I too can not say I enjoyed or did not enjoy this book. Its something I probably would not have read, but it was a book club selection. I guess more than anything the book made me feel sorry for Asha. She really suffered a lot throughout her childhood and teenage years, which could account for some of her decisions. One thing I could really see was that she was lonely and looking for love in all the wrong places. It was almost that she was real guilible or Rashid had her fooled. Especially about the appeal and getting out early. Interesting story."
5,A Powerful Story....,"I was deeply moved by Ms. Bandele's story. While I am not involved with anyone, let alone someone in prison, she somehow managed to speak to me, a single, childless college grad who loves poetry and the arts and all they have to offer. Her language flowed like music and tapped into the very things that go on inside of me. She made me feel the love that was shared between herself & Rashid. She caused me to hope that someday I will be as lucky, no...BLESSED as she in finding a love like this. I am proud and excited to have discovered this memoir and this young, black, intelligent & lyrical author/poet. I will be looking forward to many things from this woman."
5,"A Must Have For the Next Millenium! We Love, Love, Love It!","Simply the best under-rated record this year. I'm sure it will take off, and take off big next year! Xander Smith and Precious pull off a vocal blend that stands second to none! Smith's guitar mastery is just as good if not better live then on these 11 golden tracts. BTW- whoever does their web site did an excellent job seaching out and up-loading all thier personal info., band history, ect. Good Listening and Good Reading: othestarpeople.com"
5,really easy to listen to and enjoy:very upbeat,"We are middle aged and thrilled by this pop album from the new, and what we feel will be, very successful group! The drummer is fab and we love the vocals."
5,OSP just blew away Chicago,"The record is fantastic--buy it and then pray to the music gods that this amazing, rock and roll band sees fit to show up in the neighborhood. the music is so loud but so so so sweet. As is that drummer."
3,Won't work on players that read CD-R/RW,"I gave it 3 stars because I love this album. I really do. But the fact that I can only play it on my rickety old CD player (that's gasping its last breath as it is) and not on any other CD player I own is a huge disappointment. I've noticed that there's only a problem on players that read CD-R and CD-RW. So, if you plan on listening to it on one of those, stay away from the Cleopatra release.I can't very well carry the vinyl version I've had for years with me so hopefully I'll be able to track down the Nostradamus version of this CD eventually. It's a shame, really it is."
5,Excellent song!,"This is an AMAZING song! Once again, Gloria has outdone herself! WAY to GO! LOVE So Pra Contrariar also!"
3,"It can get boring at times ""yeah i said it!""","I won't bore you with a long review, the truth is that this game has it's limitations , it's passable but!!!!!!!!!! it can get boring at times, when i ended this game i was not satistfied i did not feel anything, to tell you the truth through this whole game you won't feel anything but boredom.it has it's moments, but then it's just moments , sometimes it can challange you but all in all don't buy this game borrow it from a friend if you like it, then you like it, but i just can't say this is one of my classic must keep Ps2 games, or !!! did i mention the graphics suck ""well there again i said it"" Activision ummmmmmhlaterz folks..............."
4,Awesome Game!,"This game is a-w-e-s-o-m-e! But wow, is it short. I feel a little ripped off for paying about $50 for just a few weeks of play. But maybe it's just that I was so addictive to the game.This is an awesome WWII-based game! The characters are... ""alive"" yet I still want more action! But the game is realy worth your time. Don't rent it. BUY IT"
3,Not As Good As The Xbox Version,"This game does have all of the same FP shooter action of the other console version (Xbox) but this game has inferior graphics and textures. This game lacks progressive scan and this is definitely needed if you plan on playing this on an HDTV. The way the enemy characters move is absolutely ridiculous. This version also has no multiplayer features for you if you're into that sort of thing, unlike the Xbox version. So, while this game is still fun to play, you can do better with the original PC or Xbox version. Another thing I need to add is that when you beat this version, you don't unlock the original PC classic Wolfenstein 3D. In the Xbox version you do get Wolfenstein 3D as a bonus. BTW, the sequel Wolfenstein on current Gen systems is much better."
5,Mkkreg,"Awesome game!! It starts out alittle slow but it is the first game that I have enjoyed as mush as Frontline. The graphics are great. They do a great job with fog and fire(flame thower). The story kept my interest all the way though. If you like Frontline, 007, Half Life you will like this game."
5,gary a at hazelbrook,"The best book i ever read! The pictures were oustanding , the feel of the story gripping for every one.I wish I could have written this book and next year i'm even going to get a copy of the game as well !"
2,Dark visuals and boring,"I just finished this game and was not happy. The visuals are way too dark, even on the brightest options settings it was hard to see. What a disappointment. My biggest problem was with the very linear plot, one way through each level, walk in and shoot. No strategy at all. My latest test of a good game: Walk up to a fuel tanker truck, place a ton of explosives on the side and detonate. If the truck doesn't move and there is not a scratch on it when you're finished, then you have a crappy game on your hands. Wolfenstein failed miserably."
1,This game made me physically sick.,"First let me say I haven't played the PC version of this game, just the PS2.--Starting out in this game, I felt like I'd actually been transported back into the times of Doom 1 and Wolfenstein 3d.This is because the graphics are horrible and outdated, I've seen better games on PS1.The controls and unability to easily look around also make you very seasick, very quickly.Buy this game if you really need to get the feeling of original Wolfenstein. Except this time, you will need motion sickness pills."
5,Gabriel Hawk's Lady,I truly enjoyed this book. The characters were strong. The book flowed which I like. Any one reading this book will enjoy it.
3,Meh,"Well enough made except the glass dropper section is too short, a good 1/4"" short of the bottle bottom when fully screwed in & much more when unscrewed in the useable position. You can't get the liquid out from the bottom."
5,The new value of Mexican Song,"The songs and the performance are excellent. Jose Cardenas' voice is so beautiful for Mexican songs. The way he sings the ""falsete"" (very acute notes, characteristic of Mexican songs) is unique. The song ""El Tequereque"" is very joyful and the first song of the album, ""Te Quiero, Te Quiero"" is very romantic. I widely recomend the album for mariachi music lovers."
2,Something's Missing Here....,"I usually really like the Melvins, but this album is pretty dull. The riffs are uninteresting and repetitive, and overall this is the most mainstream recording they've put out."
1,"""The Week"" lied","In a usually reliable weekly news magazine, ""The Week"" this CD received a rave review and several stars. I made the purchase decision on this recomendation. Disappointed. At best this will pass for nondescript movie music that you will never read the credits to see what the music was. Boring and not particularly engaging. This music has none of the flare or genius of a Vaughn Williams. It crescendos for no reason and becomes pale for the same unintelligible reason. Waste of my hard earned money. My fault really for taking the review from a news magazine instead of the always reliable ""ClassicFM""."
3,Starts Good But Gets Bogged Down,Started well but there were chapters that just lagged. It will probably be of more interest to those wishing to decipher treasure signs.
2,Poor Quality,"Very, very disappointing product. It's no stick, but only for the first use. After that the no stick surface begins to peel off. It was even worse after cleaning off the stuff that stuck to it! Overall not worth the money, I'm sure there are other comparable products that work much better."
4,"Fast, simple and tasty breakfast goods",I am the same as Kelly. I borrow the book from the library and try a couple recipes to make sure it tastes good and then buy the book. This book offers alternatives to the recipes which I like. Sometimes you don't want to make the same thing over and over again although you like it the first time and the alternatives add a different twist. The cranberry scone was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!
5,There Are 508 Stars In The Sky,"Very delightful book. The quality, from the illustrations to the storyline, is first-class. A must reading for children."
5,Brilliant,This author is the voice of the disenfranchised. This book is among his best. I think it is iconic Espada.
2,Book,"I received the book on schedule, it was torn in half which was a big disappointment and had I not had to use the book for class, I would have sent it back. It's also somewhat of a thick book. It has good information, but the book wasn't in a brand new condition. I paid the full price and got half the product."
1,Book Review,"The book covers general aspects of audio engineering at an introductory level. It is a good book for the very beginner who is interested in learning general aspects of audio, but it is not suitable for the audio professional. I am an audio professional an I did not find in depth information on the book."
4,A mix,"This is the CD with the black&white; cover.This might be from the same series as the other Arjuna soundtrack, but it's a different mix- odds and ends that didn't fit on the first cd. I like all the tracks except one, track 14, which is the fruit juice commercial from Arjuna. It plainly annoys me. Tracks 6-13 are great and Track 9 carries me away; it makes me think of a journey on horseback and is by far my favorite.Buy this cd if you adore Yoko Kanno (like I do) or if Arjuna is your favorite series or something. It's not the better of the two but it is good."
5,A great page turner with no empty calories,This elegantly written page-turner is a must-read for anyone over 40 or others who wish to understand them. It is pure pleasure to read. The book lingers in your mind long after you finish. Great fun but far deeper than it first appears.
5,Beautifully Written,"""Thief Of Hearts"" is a wonderful story of two middle-aged people who find each other. The characters, Annie and Jack, are finely drawn and interesting people. The e-mails between them are innovative and breathtaking. I loved this book and highly recommend it for a quick, light read."
2,Don't Let Thief of Words Steal Your Time,"Thief of Words robbed two hours of my life. A middle-aged agent ""reluctantly"" agrees to a blind lunch date with a stranger because he has a nice ass. Over the course of the next seventy excruciating chapters, ""the couple"" exchanges a mirage of sappy emails, goes out on one date, and enjoys one night of sweaty, unprotected sex. Apparently middle-age intimacy happens at the same rate that soap opera babies age!The story's pacing is off. Its dialogue is too controlled and artificial. The main characters show no depth; rather they appear desperate.Bottom line: Don't Let Thief of Words Steal Your Time"
4,A Book For Romantics,"I am a mystery writer. I read mysteries, not romances or love stories, but I think I know a good one when I read it.When we are young and nave, we have the energy to deal with the intoxication of romance and the inherent risks of courtship. But what about when we are fortyish, when we are wizened if not damage by experience? How do matters of the heart compete with defenses and baggage accumulated over twenty years of hard living? Thief of Words explores these questions in an highly personal way. Through e-mail exchanges, we are witness to the courtship of Jack and Annie, two adults who are must deal with the most basic--and mysterious-impulses. Thief of Words is a book for all who want to remember the joy - and the pain - of falling in love again.Elliott LightAuthor of ""Lonesome Song"" and ""Chain Thinking"""
5,"Doesn't take itself to seriously, and is better for it.","The success of Steps throughout Euroupe (especially in the UK) proves that they are definetly something to get excited about. I feel the US version emulates the original, which in its own right was perfect, but now it has an extra dancier aspect (is dancier an word?), but retains the overall feeling of the original. This is pure pop, and couln't be better."
1,Abysmal,"it is impossible to defend this talentless, irritating and basically manufactured gutter version of Abba wannabes. there act and image lack any originality and energy, and their music is drained of any of the appeall that some people see in abba. This band are one of many sub-standard manufactured trash groups which dominate the british charts.If this type of music would appeal to you I urge you to listen to the original Abba rather than this, or better still check out some good bands like Everclear or Greenday."
1,Best listened to with industrial ear muffs.,"This will make you gnash your pearly whites and chunder big style, especially if you're from Winwick! This is the group talent forgot - bin it!"
1,Listen Here....,"They grin, they dance, they clap, they wear the same clothes, they have to be dressed by their manager ............Yes this is Steps, the one thing they don't do is produce music worthy of listening to outside of Sesame street. This band are aimed at the very young child whose brain hasn't fully developed to the level when you can identify between good music and Pop-Trash. The one thing good about Steps is in two years time they will have disappeared."
4,a wonderful book to have on the shelf,"my set design professor described this as the book to read when one is disillusioned with theater and need to restore faith, and I have to agree. It reminds us of the total art of theater, where poetry is expressed verbally, visually, and through the _presence_ of actors in a setting. It describes the curious not-reality that theater should create. It was written in 1941, so some of the references ring a little false and the language can wax florid, but the essence of what theater should be is described here."
5,Must have!!,"Simply put, a must have for the library of anyone interested in theatrical design.Robert Edmund Jones was the father of the New American Stagecraft and has, as such, influenced all scenic and lighting designers who followed - even if they are not aware of it!As someone now entering his 20th year as a college prof, and around his 30th as a professional designer, I am constantly reinvigorated and enthused by the words of Jones. He reminds us of the importance of the arts in our society and why we do what we do.A rough paraphrase from the book - ""Do we carry visions of poetry with us as we shout directions to electricians on ladders? Yes."""
4,take it with an open mind,"OK, you can't rate this book on the level of literature, cuz it's not. From that point of view it's horrible. But you can rate it on what it might teach you if you let it ""speak to you."" This is a book that can easily be taken two ways. 1) An inspiring look at theater and at life, and 2) the cheesiest, corniest, campiest thing ever. I myself have wondered at times how I really feel about this book. I have had it read it throughout this past quarter for my Stagecraft class, and it can say a whole lot or it can say nothing, depending on how you read it. The author's absolute passion for all aspects of theater often comes across as wishy-washy, but if you set that aside, you might, if you love theater, find that you can relate to what he is saying. Or you might make fun of it incessantly! Which I have done a few times. But seriously, it's the kind of book that if you tell yourself you'll take a lot out of it, you will. And in several ways, I have."
2,Not as Good as Expected,Barry's new CD is a bit of a let down. It seems he sang his best songs on talk shows off this CD. I'm glad I got this at the bargain price of $6.99 for my wife. She's been a fan for over 30 years but lately his CDs haven't been worth purchasing.
3,Greatest Songs of the Sixties,The Songs are great but I keep hearing the origional artist singing them and they song better. Yet I love Barry Manilow.
3,Not Barry Manilows best,"I am a big Barry Manilow fan but his ""songs of the 60's"" was disappointing. I graduated from high school in 1967 so this CD really appealed to me, bringing back many memories of that time. It seems as though many singers are wanting to bring back the old romantic songs and many have been able to pull them off, but this CD of the 60's just didn't do it for me. I love the original songs of Barry Manilow, his ""own"" songs, now that's what I call romantic music. I did purchase his ""songs of the 50's"" which I liked very much, but this one, just isn't one of his best"
2,Barry should stick to the 70's,Did not enjoy the song selection on this CD. Only like 2 of the songs. His 70's CD is much better.
4,Barry is still singing so well!,I've listened to this album yesterday and I'm keeping it very close to my preferred CDs to keep on listening to it in the near future. I love the way he sings and recreated this album but also consider (as another review writer before) that he is a very good writer of new songs and I hope he will write new songs for a new album not only new versions of oldies but ... this is a very good album either.
3,Rod Stewert does it better,"Manilow's remakes of 50's and 60's hits were a little bit disappointing to me. I would much rather listen to his own ""oldies"". Rod Stewerts remakes of songs from the same genre are much better, even though I still like to listen to his own ""oldies"" more."
3,Disappointing,I absolutely loved Manilow's Greatest Hits of the Fifties and was truly excited to hear that he had done a record of sixties covers. The results are disappointing. This recording is not nearly as enjoyable as its fifties predecessor. Perhaps it is because I do remember the original versions of each of these songs. Manilow's covers of Cherish/Windy and There's a Kind of Hush just make me want to pull out my Association and Herman's Hermits CDs. There just isn't any song that he covers on this disc that is as good as the original.
2,Please do something original,"Barry, please create music again. Clive Davis you do not need. This is so below you. Your versions do NOTHING compared to the originals. Be your own man and make a new album of songs we are not familiar with. This is karoake at it's worst. You are better than this tripe."
3,Karaoke at its best.,"Some of us might quibble a bit with Manilow's insistence that ""Blue Velvet"" is one of the greatest songs of the '60s.I suppose that depends what you were doing during that decade, or how you interpret the artistic explosion of the decade's music.Manilow apparently remembers the '60s as one long suburban cocktail party attended only by white people. This dreck - with the stiffest, whitest arrangements I've heard this side of ""The Lawrence Welk Show,"" and the all but unparalleled, karaoke-style blandness of the vocal delivery - makes Rod Stewart singing jazz seem a welcome option.Someone please make this ridiculously colorless repackaging of the past stop.It's starting to get scary."
2,NOT SO GREAT THE SECOND TIME AROUND!,Bad choice of songs and poor renditions. I think it is a failure.
2,GREATEST SONGS OF THE SIXTIES,"GREAT SELECTION, GREAT PRICE, FAST SHIPPING, BUT WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET A CD THAT IS BAD? COSTS AS MUCH TO SEND IT BACK AS IT DID TO BUY IT....."
4,Fits Schalloch Drum Perfectly,"The drum head fits the Schalloch 12 inch Djembe perfectly and is ez to replace. The skin is very thin though, but I think Schalloch intended on that and it contributes to this drums nice tone. This is the second time I had to replace this drum head. And that is why you spend the money and get yourself a decent Djembe bag. My drum was not covered and this head got ripped on 2 separate occasions. The drum sounds pretty good with this head and I love tunable djembes much more then Rope tuned djembes. Also if you rip your tunable Djembe head, it is no where near as ez to replace as it is for a drum head like this. It take 5 minutes to get this new head on. and probably a few hours for a rope tuned. I give this head 4 stars because it fits, is ez to replace, and sounds good. But it loses a star because it is pretty expensive in my opinion, knock it down to $35 Schalloch and I will give it 5 stars."
4,THE END OF TIME,"This is the thrid and final book in a often detailed and sometime glossy overview of the last decade of the Doctor - the 1980's. The book chronicles the end of Tom Baker as the 4th Doctor and the rise of Peter Davidson as the 5th and the decline and fall of the series with Colin Baker (who in my book was never given the chance or the material to really shine) and Sylvester McCoy. The books gives behind the scenes details into the stories, the people, public intrest (and sometimes disinterest), as well as ending chapters on all the merchandise (with layouts and cool pictures) produced during the 1980's. As a whole the entire collection is a must for every Doctor Who fan, on it's own, the material is solid, well written and worth the price. The only downside perhaps is that the material can get a bit thin in places, and sometimes leaving wanting to know more. But this is not very often. Pick up the 1960's first to really get the full effect."
3,It's Alright,"Laserhawk was an alright movie. Nothing particularily amazing, but the plot was good, and the actors were well casted. Over all, it was worth seeing."
5,Laserhawk is a Cult Classic,Laserhawk is an underated movie with Cult following. Give it a try. It is nothing like I expected.
3,celebrity playground south beach,The first played but the second kept coming no disc.I triedcleaning it but same thing.Can you please send me another one.Thank youMichael
3,Too much underlining,"Arrived on time, but there was alot of underlining, highlighting, etc. which makes it difficult to read some of the text."
4,Window cleaner washes out as a hero,"After appearing on three early BBC-TV sitcoms, Norman Wisdom made a string of comedies for the Rank Organsation. UP IN THE WORLD is one of his typical slapstick farces. Here, Norman is a window cleaner at a mansion. His work is interrupted by the estate owner's son, who wants to be taken into town. While there, the boy is the victim of a kidnapping attempt. Norman fights off the bad guys. His young charge sustains amnesia from a bump on the head, and can't remember anything about the crime.Sir Norman co-stars with Jason Robards, Britt Ekland and Forrest Tucker in the 1968 homage to burlesque, THE NIGHT THEY RAIDED MINSKY'S.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.2) Up in the World (UK-1956) - Norman Wisdom/Maureen Swanson/Jerry Desmonde/Michael Caridia/Colin Gordon/Ambrosine Phillpotts/Michael Ward"
3,one-of-a-kind,"Captivating if only for the point-of-view. Misses the mark though of ""major political memoir"" because is too random in approach and lacks ""confirm or deny"" from opposition."
1,Amazing Book by a Crucified Lakotah,"Today Leonard Peltier had a parole hearing so he was in my prayers and many other people's prayers here locally today. So I thought I'd write this review. Even the Attorney General has admitted that he isn't guilty of any crimes, yet he's allowed to remain in confinement. Such a sad, corrupt society we're living in today. His poems are very beautiful and the book is a great read. I'm giving it one star because five stars wouldn't have been enough."
5,We anglos should be ASHAMED !!!!,"Ashamed I am. Not only did we steal from those who had, but we continue to persecute the weak. Why does our gov't. continue to war with other countrys who have a different belief in control? We can not even take care of our own selfish regulations. Those who are in control, are money hungry and egotistical, and not caring for others. We should all in good conscience contact all of our federal peoples and demand Leonard Peltier's freedom. And we should continue to put presure on them until the job is finished."
5,This book is Inspirational,"This book not only gave me a deeper understanding of a man who has been wrongfully imprisoned for so long, it also made me look at my own life from a different perspective. Leonard Peltier is strong, wise, and still a fighter, where others would have given up long ago."
5,very moving book,I was around when all the Wounded Knee was going on. I think that a horrible injustice was done to the Indian people period much less to Leonard Peltier himself. I have only read about 1/3 of the book because it made me so angry and so sad. My brother I hope someday you will be free in body as well as spirit. I hope someday you will be able to again participate in a Sun Dance.
1,Have any 5-star raters seen THIS version??,"I don't know what was going on. I thought this show was ridiculous, it looked (and supposedly was) sort of rushed and put together overnight. I've seen shows that have been rushed and put together overnight by high school students that were better than this. Other than Kris Phillips and Elaine Paige, the singers were truly mediocre and many sounded completely amateur. Maybe they are really dancers. I hope so for their sake.I guess that's what they could get for a performance in Beijing. Hopefully, but sadly, they couldn't do any better. But, we're talking about $$money$$ here folks, and trust me, you'd much rather spend your money on the Royal Albert Hall Celebration. You'll be glad you did it."
3,pretty good,"It was very, good as far as the show itself,however, wish it was caption capable for the hearing impaired,because although I am able to hear most things,when the actors were just talking I had a hard time understanding them,but as far as the show in its self it was very good...."
2,masterpiece,"Disappointed with the lack of quality in general. Was expecting an excellent show, sound quality and image - decent is how i would rate it but thats all."
1,Poor Quality,This has to be the worst quality CD I've ever heard. Sounds like it was recorded in a gymnasium. Orchestra drowned out the performer. Lighting and set design were extremely poor.
2,An Oldy but Goody,"This is Jayne Ann Krenz and her alter ego Jayne Castle at their best. Each story is bright, well written and satisfying. I have a preference for the scifi story best but bother are well worth reading again. The book was purchased for a friend's birthday as an introduction to modern romance. It as a resounding success!"
2,Not My Taste,"I picked this book for book club. I thought it would be quirky and different. From a black point of view but not the typical. Well this book was different, but all I got out of it was how to fight. There was so much fighting in this book, it just got on my nerves. I didn't finish the book and I was the host! This book just didn't keep me interested. I really tried to like it. It just jumped around too much from fight to fight, to the main character being thrown in jail, to his many sexscapades. Nobody read this book from my book club. I was kind of shamed that I picked it."
2,Cheap material.,"The T-Shirt has indeed an UBUNTU logo on the front... But it's made out of cheap cotton, it feels thin, and after 3 washes it looks old, the logo is losing its colors. Really cheap produtc in my opinion."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV,"DO NOT BUY THIS TELEVISION. IT DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE PICTURE TO FIT THE SCREEN FOR BROADCAST DIGITA CABLE (non-HDTV) SOURCES. And here is the real horror: if those bars burn in (Samsung recommends that you do not view non-screen filling material more than 15% of the time), your warranty is void! You only find this out AFTER you try to change the screen size and read the manual. I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS TELEVISION! I am stuck with this TV; you should not have to be :("
3,So-so,"""River"" is certainly not a bad album, especially not if you prefer Izzy Stradlin at his hardest rocking and most punk-ish (which I don't). But it is far from being as musically versatile (or indeed as melodic) as his two best records, ""117"" and the superb, still-to-be-recognized classic ""Izzy Stradlin And The Ju Ju Hounds"".I prefer Izzy's previous blend of rock n' roll, hard rock and acoustic blues-rock, which you'll find on the two albums mentioned above, but ""River"" has its moments as well. There's just a little bit too far between them, and most of these cuts, while not bad, aren't all that memorable.(Izzy's latest album, ""On Down The Road"", recaptures most of his early-90s glory, however. Try listening to that one - provided you already have ""Ju Ju Hounds""!)"
4,River,"Just purchased River & really enjoyed it. However, this is the 1st album of Izzy's where I found 2 songs I didn't really care for. I won't say which they were b/c I think others should judge for themselves. I just didn't care for the way his voice sounded on the 2 songs. I usually love his voice & I love the way his voice sounded on the rest of this album. His voice did sound different on this whole album, though. There are a few instrumental songs on this album. I recommend that if you really like Izzy Stradlin, you should purchase any of his work you can, b/c someone claiming to know Izzy, warned that Izzy's 2010 album maybe his last. This may just be wild speculation on the part of an unreliable source. It upset me enough, though, that I felt the need to warn people in case it is true."
3,"My introduction to Izzy, and it's not bad","I'm not a big Guns N' Roses fan, so I don't really care that this doesn't sound like Guns N' Roses part 2. The songs have a very commercial sound which at times make me feel a little awkward while listening to this album. Having said that, I'm surprised that Izzy's solo material isn't played on the radio. It's a mix of blues, country, soft rock, and even reggae. There are no real standout tracks, in my opinion, but it's a solid album hurt by poor production. 3.5/5"
1,"Solid Tunes, Terrible Production","What the HELL happened in the studio? The production on this disc is some of the worst ever...I've heard bootlegs that sounded better than this! Muffled to the point of distraction...the drum sound is especially atrocious, gutless, no punch at all, like the drummer was playing empty oatmeal boxes. The sound almost completely ruins what would otherwise be another pretty decent release. Stick with the previous 3 discs, PLEASE don't let this be your total introduction to Izzy...he deserves better."
4,Big Izzy fan...not as good,"I love Izzy, but this is fourth on my list of Izzy solo albums. The riffs and song writing aren't quite as good as the other albums. This says nothing about the raggae songs or the performance which are great on both counts. Any Izzy fan should get this album because it is good, just not as good as Ride On or 117 Degrees."
4,downloads gone,"I found the book very useful, but a note of caution -The downloadable code supporting the examples in the book seems to have diappeared; saw some refs to the publisher going out of business. Gonna have to type in the code, but I can live with that."
3,Good For Beginners,"I have very little Mysql experience, but the book did allow me to accomplish what I needed to do. I believe this will make a good reference book. This book is good for learning the basics of Mysql Administration. But most of this can be found in the Mysql manual. Also Innodb should be in more details."
5,Part of baby's nighttime routine every night,"I have been playing this CD every night at bedtime since my baby was 3 months old (she's 8 months now) and I think it's the reason she goes to sleep so easily! Very nice, soothing, consistent music. I received it as a gift from someone used it for her baby and loved it."
5,white heat,My son is really into old movies and I had a hard time finding this one.It is a great gangster movie.
5,James Cagney's best film,"I saw ""White Heat"" years ago and it made me a James Cagney fan. He is great in this film!!Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore."
5,Top of the World,"Terrific Cagney at his best. This is an ""Oldie"" but will never be outdated. If its desired to see when acting was Priority ONE in Hollywood, WHITE HEAT is your meat"
5,White Heat,"Raoul Walsh's dynamite gangster picture is so much more than a re-tread of the early thirties gangster classics that made Cagney a star. Here we are less concerned with the cat-and-mouse aspects of the story (though they are plenty diverting), more focused on the progressive mental disintegration of the central character. Cagney is outstanding as Jarrett, a man whose own demons may consume him before the police finish the job. Electrifying stuff, and a Cagney peak."
4,"A Killer Gangster Picture, Cagney at His Best!","I looks like just another gangster picture, but it's not, it's much more. James Cagney returned to gangster roles because the role of Cody Jarrett was just to good to turn down. He creates one of the most ruthless characters ever to grace the silver screen. His Cody Jarrett is a brilliant personification of criminal paranoia mixed with motherly obsession. Just by seeing him on the screen, his intensity feels like the screen will explode. Probably Cagney's best role, certainly his most meaty, Cody's breakdown headache sequences are harrowing but brilliant. The story takes a back-seat, this is basically Cagney's show, but Virginia Mayo deserves credit for her role, she oozes sex appeal. The 'Top of the World' finale is now classic. Great for Cagney fans and gangster buffs. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
3,"NICE PLAYERS, WEAK STORY","I had never seen this particular Cagney flick, so I put my dime in the machine and away we went! Virginia Mayo was saucy, Cagney was tough and rowdy, but the story left me a little cold. Many other good Cagney movies to try--let this one go."
3,White Heat cools over time,"First off, if you love heist movies, buy this. No question. This movie is good, very good, but if you are only a casual movie watcher this one will miss the mark. Heist movies for me are all about the technology. A new high tech safe to crack, a higher tech way to crack it, and an even higherer tech way to catch the crooks before they get to the safe? Now that's a movie! This movie is an anachronism, a relic, an old dusty diamond in the rough with the subtle complexities that could only be captured in black and white and a healthy dose of old fashioned police work (old fashioned in a very literal sense). If you have the time to watch it and some extra coin, buy this movie, watch it, enjoy it, then forget about it till James Cagney comes up in conversation."
2,"Lukewarm, lacking excitement","This movie barely held my interest. It is simply not an exciting story, and that is why I can't give it more than two stars. A gangster film has to be exciting, and if it fails in that, it fails as a movie.Much is made, in all of the reviews and summaries, of Cagney's gangster being insanely dependent on his mother. That is not true. If they wanted to portray that on screen they would've had to do a much better job of it. What I see is a man whose mother means a lot to him, but I don't see an insanity there. If all you have to do to show insanity is show a man caring about his mom, then this succeeds. But you need to show more than that. There is no insanity involved in the screen relationship between Cagney and his mom in this film. He likes his mom. So what.I'm not interested in fireworks in movies. I'm not impressed by exploding gas tanks. Another big ""so what"". This movie was a disappointment to me."
4,Cagney on Fire,Fast shipping. This is not a misunderstood killer or bully. It's just what he is and he wants you to understand it.
1,Avoid at all costs!,"Even if someone offers to give you this printer for free, don't take it. I wasted $100 on it. I think I got about 10 copies before the black ink cartridge ran out. It never feeds the paper correctly, constant paper jams. Visiting the Canon website and following all of their troubleshooting steps has not worked. I threw this thing away. The scanner works OK but that's about it."
4,great purchase,"i bought this all in one for university use...and its a great deal!! the scanning is pretty fast, and the output quality is commendable....also, ive been able to print black pages very quickly...the printer doesnt seem to have as much of an issue with 'start up time' as some epson models do...a good buyim rating it one lower cuz its slightly on the bulky side...the controls could have been put on the front sides to prevent an awkward control box projecting out of the front of the printer...but all things considerd, its a great buyalso, it has 2 cartridges...so replacement is not goin to empty my pocketoverall - if ur lookin for above normal use, good printing quality and all functions in one, then this is probably the best value for ur money out there"
5,Great Printer - Scanner- Copier,This is Great all in one printer. Based on some reviews I thought it might not do a good scanning but my experience is it is giving a good scannig results.
1,Don't waste your $$$,"Don't waste your money seeing this grotesque movie. I'm not a prude and I enjoy watching stylized violence in an action flick, where the story calls for it. However, this movie goes way over the line with incest and a very twisted act of revenge. There's nothing redeeming about this movie. I'm really ashamed that something like this came from Korean media. Thumbs way way down on this movie..."
1,Oldboy? more like Ohboy..........,"This is one of the most overhyped piece of crap ever to be transferred onto DVD.Not only was this movie lacking in excitement and/or creativity, but i had to watch it 2-3 times just to see if i missed something.....but it sucked all 3 times. Ever watch a movie so horrible you wish you could reclaim those hours back? This is that movie. Do yourself a favor and don't entertain the idea of watching this. Only a night of ingesting 8 bean burritos laced with laxatives can give you this result. Beware!!!!"
3,oldboy,"this movie in my opinion was crazy, but even crazier and so unexpected to me was the ending!!!! it had me shocked!!! if u can handle the dark tones this movie has, see it...or just see it 4 the ending."
4,Did you say violence?,A man is mysteriously imprisoned during 15 years in a hotel room. And once he's released he will just have five days to find his captor and seek revenge.The plot is denser than ususal in this terrible existential drama that will involve victim and victimary.The movie in question was awarded with the Great Prize of Cannes in 2004. A well rounded script highly praised by Quentin Tarantino that knows this issue as just as few directors in the world.A cult movie since its immediate release.
2,Oldboy,"Oldboy is not my kind of movie. I watched it twice, Maybe other viewers would enjoy it. There's a movie for everyone."
3,Blu ray review,"Ok, the film is a classic and deserves five stars. However, this blu ray is not a five star release by a long shot. The video quality is barely above dvd-level. I have compared with both Tartan's dvd and the director approved Starmax dvd edition. Surely the video is better on this disc but there is alot of grain and picture is quite fuzzy at times. Sound quality is however better and worth the upgrade. Extras are good but in standard def. So if you are a fan of this movie and want to own it on blu ray, wait for a better transfer that surely must come. Because this masterpiece needs a better treatment than it has gotten on this release."
4,"Boy, what a twisted movie",My my... this is one trippy movie! I was completely absorbed and sat still for the next two hours which is rare for me. The storyline is shocking and devastating. The actors are all wonderful and could accuracy convey anguish. I wanted to turn my head away for several parts of the film but refused because I didn't want to miss a second.
5,One twisted film ending!,"Great film, crazy premise. Check out the twist in this film!! Lots of action cool fight scenes, make this memorable and the ending makes it unforgettable. Just remember this film is not for the feint of heart... or stomach."
5,oldboy,This movie was awsome... i saw this movie when it first came to the states a few years back..when i ordered it i was hopeing it would come befor the weekend and it did perfict condision ready for the watching.. and i did fall back in love with how well this movie was made and the story..beleave me when i say this is not for kids and carefull watching it with your girlfriend they dont look at you the same after watching it with them.
2,Graphic violence detracts from great acting,"It is a solid mystery with a stellar cast and excellent acting, but I just couldn't warm up to the underlying theme of visceral violence, self-mutilation, and, most disturbing of all, incest. If you are open to controversial topics, then I'd recommend this movie. If not, this may leave bad taste in your mouth."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"...I'd describe it as Tarantino meets Charlie Kaufman with a little David Lynch thrown in. We rented this because the woman who was on with Richard Roeper last week said it was good and my husband thought it was an action film - he likes Jet Li's movies and thought it was going to be something like that. NOT. I should have checked here first to read about it. Anyway, we didn't like it much. I did think the beginning was good and I was interested for a while, but it quickly started to bore me and, as another reviewer here said, the way the torture/violence is done is a little too real. I also thought the acting was amateurish and over the top. It just wasn't my thing. I thought the plot was kind of ridiculous after the reason for the 15-year imprisonment was revealed. Obviously we won't be taking any more of this lady's recommendations. The other film we rented on her recommendation was just as bad. Can't win them all."
2,Shallow plot,"Shallow plot offering plenty of occasions for gratuitous graphic violence. Nevertheless, acting and aesthetics are rather good."
2,Oldboy Review,What can I say? For the first half of the movie I was lost. It was only at the last 30 minutes the movie caught my interest. It was not the worst film I have seen but it certainy was not for me.
2,THE most overrated film I have ever seen,"Beyond the wicked twist that is supplied near the end, this pale rehash of the Count of Monte Cristo is far from the event that so many have made it out to be. Boring story, boring fights and boring characters. Where is the film that so many here and other places have talked about endlessly? Where is the film that took over Canne?"
2,REVENGE IS BITTER AND SWEET,"I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I WATCHED IT THINKING WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG TO GET TO THE REAL ACTION. IT'S A MIND GAME, THRILLER WITH TWIST AND TURNS THAT TAKE YOU ON A SLOW RIDE TO THE TRUTH. A MAN IS KIDNAPPED AN KEPT IN A SMALL ROOM FOR 15 YEARS NOT KNOWING WHY. HE EVENTUALLY GETS OUT AND SEARCHES FOR THE REASON. IN DOING SO HE BEFRIENDS A WOMEN WHO TURNS OUT TO BE... WELL YOU WILL HAVE TO SEE FOR YOURSELF. EVERY MOVE THIS MAN TAKES TO GET SOME ANSWERS IS ALREADY CALCUATED BY THIS PSYCHO WHO BELIEVES HE IS SEEKING REVENGE FOR THE DEATH OF HIS SISTER. THE LEAD ACTORS DID AN EXCELLENT JOB. I DID WATCH THIS MOVIE TO THE END BUT I JUST DIDN'T CARE ANYMORE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO OUT THERE. HERE YOU WILL SEE REALITY BECOME UNREAL, UNREAL TURN INTO IMPOSSIBLE AND THE IMPOSSIBLE IS JUST UNBELIEVEABLE. THE MOVIES CONCEPT WAS GOOD BUT A LITTLE TO DEEP AND TO SLOW FOR ME. SORRY! BUTT I WILL SAY THIS THE TATOO WAS A MEMORABLE SCENE."
3,"Interesting, but nothing spectacular.","I was afraid to watch this because it has been said over and over how ultra-violent a movie Oldboy is. I tend to be a little squemish, and nothing here bothered me that much (but to be fair, I closed my eyes during the tooth pulling scene). The whole octopus thing, was unpleasant but nothing here made this a horror movie. It reminded me of a less stylized Kill Bill.The ""big reveal"" is a twist I didn't see coming, but it left a sour taste in my mouth and a few questions...I wanted to give it two stars, but I thought since I was still thinking about it the next day, it probably deserved three. Can't say I would watch this again any time soon."
5,Awesome,"I think oldboy is one of the best film of our times. This edition is perfect for anybody who is in love with the film. Also if you are a film buff, their are lots of extras that you will like."
4,"Psychedelic, Good, But Too Gory","This movie pulls you in and keeps you guessing. It's basically a story of revenge wrapped in a mystery. The second half of the movie is quite edgy. There is graphic violence and a fairly gruesome scene where the main character cuts off his own tongue. That little detail doesn't give away anything in the main plot, but it should provide our gentle viewers with fair and sufficient warning. Take the R rating seriously. This movie is not for kids or teenagers. It's for mature adults who occasionally like to explore cinema's darker realm. The ending has a clever, but disturbing, twist. Some call it brilliant, perhaps with good reason. It's like a bloody version of an M. Night Shyamalan film. The purple surprise package ties up all the loose ends. You won't be perplexed. You'll know exactly what has happened and why. The English dubbing is well done. You don't need to read subtitles. By the way, ever watch a movie called Angels & Insects?"
3,wild!!!!,This movie was not what I expected. It kept you guessing til the end. It wasn't my cup of tea but if you like gore you'll enjoy it.
1,waste of 3 hours of my life,"I watched this movie twice as I thought maybe i missed the point of the movie,I thought with so many rave reviews of this move,as to how good it was and what a masterpiece of a movie it was LOL,maybe I missed something? maybe I need to be high or drunk to enjoy it? I would not say it was the worst movie I ever watched but its a long long way to be a great movie,it was not scary or disturbing,the movie is in the same class as the ring or the blair witch project,it is too convoluted and unconvincing to be a good movie,a waste of time."
4,A Thinking-Person's Action/Thriller,"""Oldboy"" is as mysterious as it is action-packed. The story revolves around Dae-su, an overweight, obnoxious drunk who passes out one day and wakes up in a bizarre prison where he'll spend the next 15 years. He doesn't know where he is, why he's there or who locked him up. After 15 years of reflection and shadow boxing, he's mysteriously released -- lean, mean, and hungry for revenge, not to mention answers. But who's getting revenge on whom?If you enjoy mystery thrillers like ""Memento"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" and the classic TV series ""The Prisoner"" -- the ones where you get the big payoff at the end if you've been paying attention -- you'll like ""Oldboy,"" too. Plus, it's a great revenge story, a la ""Kill Bill."" It's dark, disturbing, and full of twists and turns. Plus, you get to see a man eat a live octopus (no special effects). What more could you ask for?"
4,"""Vengeance has become a part of me.""","After being mysteriously locked away for 15 years in a cell, that looked like a cheap motel room, Oh Dae-su wakes up outside in the free world with no clue as to who's responsible for his imprisonment. To make matters worse his wife has been murdered and he's the main suspect. With nothing but revenge on his mind and a claw hammer for a weapon Oh Dae-su sets out to find and kill his tormentors.I liked this film and thought the cinematography was fresh and the soundtrack was beautiful, but I also think the violence was nowhere near what the hype had me expecting in particular the hallway fight scene. It was fun to watch but many of the punches didn't even look real.Sorry about the knit picking. OLDBOY is worth watching (Park is a very talented director), but just don't expect The Second Coming of ICHI THE KILLER even though, like ICHI, there was a self-tongue amputation."
3,"top-10 movie, bottom-10 blu ray","This is a fantastic movie, one of my favorites. That being said, I hate this blu-ray. Save your money. Buy the Tartan DVD. I've read that this was an intentionally bad transfer. I hope so, otherwise this is inexcusable. Grainy and flat, there is really no difference in picture quality from the DVD. Not much of an audiophile, so I can't speak to the sound quality. Again, I hear this was what the director wanted with this picture, but if I'd realized this ahead of time, I would have just bought the original DVD and not have wasted money on the blu-ray edition."
5,Oh Boy! What a movie!,"This movie has more twist and turns than a rollercoaster. WARNING!!! This movie is very graphic and the subject matter may be disturbing to many people (incest - brother/sister, father/daughter, practicing dentistry with a hammer, and self-mutilation). Besides that the movie was quite entertaining for your typical revenge movie. The acting was a little stilted and the plot was one of those ""made in Hollywood"", could never happen in a million years scenarios but ""Oldboy"", in my opinion, pulls it off. It is definitely a movie to rent."
3,octopussy's revenge!,"Having heard some very good reviews round the 'net of this Korean flick, had to check it out on dvd!Although it did not quite live up to all the hype and praise, its a good little revenge flick no doubt, but the much talked about violence is all cartoonish, and the twist was good but not that great, imho.Interesting movie though, the octopus eating scene is weird for sure, that actor must of being reaaaal hungry that day :-)Go on, check it out."
4,Blu-Ray version not totally 1080p,"While I like this movie, I must write here that as of April 2008, the version doesn't seem truly 1080p. It is a bit grainy... maybe it is 720p... the back of the box say 1080p but when I show this movie on the Blu Ray enabled computer with 1920 x 1200 LCD, it is different from other 1080p movies such as Troy or Planet Earth. Those you can tell they are 1080p as there is no grain and almost every frame is a perfect 1920 x 1080 photograph."
1,MESSED UP!,"This movie is seriously messed up! the gore is disturbing, the relationship between these people is disturbing, and the vengeful plan of the guy is phsychotic. I don't think this movie taught me anything. oh wait, it did, people can be MESSED UP!! I regret watching it -.-"
1,too disturbing,"the movie started really distrubing but for some reason it was also hard to stop watching. It was hard to watch but even harder to stop because it seemed like there would be some closure some type of good ending or positive aspect. unfortunatelly, it just continued to get more and more disturbing and more and more dark and nerve racking.if you one of those type who enjoys dark movies or if you don't have the stomach for all types of garbage and craziness - this movie is not for you because regardless your taste this movie is just too disturbing"
1,if zero stars were an option...,"A few scenes were worth watching and the protagonist is a good enough actor, but the story is horrid. If it's free, it might be worth the two hours of your life, but please don't pay for this."
4,ULTIMATE REVENGE,"This movie is only for true movie goers.... I cant recommend this to my friends and family because i think they would be too disturbed!!.. You have to watch this movie to the very end. I loved it though.. Oldboy is just one of those movies that you will remember for the rest of you life, and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a fight scene that was way too long and really not necessary but the rest of the movie was awesome. I would call this movie an ultimate revenge. There is no better way to get even!!! twisted"
4,amazing movie.,Spectacular edition for an amazing movie. Highly recomendable. A gift for lovers of asian's movies.
5,dang,"i am never ""surprised"" in movies. i usually predict what mysterious goings on mean/what is going to happen long before it is revealed in the film.but uh...yeah. this movie REALLY surprised me.and it was good!BUY IT! :)but be warned. this is no pleasant surprise."
5,A Nice Surprise,"I wasn't really sure sure what to expect from this since I hadn't seen anything from Chan-wook Park, but having been so disappointed by American movies lately and so impressed by foreign films of late I gave this a try and was very impressed by it.Twisted love story to the nth degree.Pretty much every other review and the film synopsis will tell you the plot so I don't need to rehash that but I will say that the acting was fantastic and the plot twist was unexpected and disturbing. It's certainly not a film for people who like lighthearted themes as this will likely not be the movie for you. It stuck with me for a while and I loved that about it. I just rented Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance and am looking for to seeing if it will meet my expectations!"
5,This movie is great,"After you've seen thousands of movies they start to get boring. It takes a lot to get a reaction out of you, and you notice you aren't startled or surprised when some ""clever"" director tries something new. That's where Oldboy comes in...This movie is awesome. The storyline and turn of events keep you interested the whole time. One of the best films I've seen recently, and would recommend it to anyone (over 18 that is... it is full of mature content after all). I have to give credit to the director here, his vision and art direction is all by itself."
5,Captain for dark Mornings: A True Story,"Having served as a ""Psych Officer"" for a year during the Vietnam War, Shad Meshad - who later founded the National Veteran's Foundation - gives us a compelling first hand account of the utter stupidity and brutality of that war. In addition, though post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) would not be labled and reasonably understood until 1980, Meshad documents the tremendous psychological damage that this war inflicted on many of those who survived. Prophetically, as he and a planeload of soldiers disembark upon landing back in the States he describes the returning soldiers as walking ""time bombs."" Indeed, many of the inmates in US prisons and 1/3 of homeless men today are untreated Vietnam Vets."
5,Straight classic rap from Reggie,"I never really gave Redman much play time until I heard Eminem meantion him as his favorite/best rapper of all time; inlcuding 2 Pac and BIG. So I bought this cd and I definetly saw where he was coming from. Redman rips up every track, and the production is laid back, perfect music to blaze to and relax with. At the same time the lyrics can be hard and witty but still go with the flow. A damn good CD and I only wish I'd gotten it sooner."
3,My Star scale in Wrong (4 1/2 STARS)!!!!!,"Redman's debut ""What, Thee Album"" is a perfect example of how good hip-hop was when it was at its peak. Funny how popular that the genre was, yet artist seemed to put out quality material. Even albums of the time that tanked, could get some listens from me over most of todays Hip-Hop nonsense. I am sure that most listeners know at least some of Redman's material, and if not, then maybe from Televison and the Movies. Before all that though, he was an unknown outta Newark, NJ, and even though ""What the Album"" wasn't exactly top of the charts when it was released, it might be Redman's best effort, and it is a modern classic. I strongly encourage music fans of Hip-Hop to add this to their collection, as this one is a really good album"
5,Funky,"Classic Redman, nothin but that p funk rap style from '92. If you like Redman, no doubt you'll love this. Jam 4 Life."
5,A Dope album but not the best Redman (muddy waters yall),"As far the opinions of the songs no one is lying. Simply put this is the album that made Reggie Noble household name in hip hop. Watch Your Nuggets, Rated R and Blow Your Mind best songs on the album ""Heyyyh, Erick Sermon Heyyyeahyeah"" and I wont even comment on the beats. If you dont have this album, you're not a real Redman fan. Nuff Said"
1,Works... for a while,"This is the second Apricorn drive I've gotten. The first failed after a month (and was returned) and this one failed after 3 months. One failure I can see, but two failures on different style drives makes me think Apricorn is not reliable."
3,Hard To Configure,"I used the drive to make a clone of my hard drive and found the instructions to be of poor quality. I haven't needed to restore the data from the new drive, so It's really not tested yet."
4,Beyond the Academic Review,"While this story can get a bit bogged down, one of the interesting questions this book raises is how did a young white woman from a bigoted family in small town, Fresno, California in the 1940's, find herself part of one of the earliest groups willing to express civil rights philosophies? Why was she willing to endure ridicule and estrangement from family, friends and strangers to continue her life-long relationships with Richard Wright and other ""negros"" seeking to speak honestly about their ""American"" experience? Underlying all is the feeling that this is an incredibly intelligent and loving woman, who stubbornly refuses to give up her ideals in the face of hate and prejudice."
4,"Adhesive Bandages 2"" X 4-1/2"" Box of 50 (BOX)",Good product and bulk package. Again if you use bandages alot the price will beat in store prices. Free shipping offered sometimes on orders over $50.
4,"Sweet and touching, but . . .","This is a sweet and touching tribute to a much-loved husband. I found the letters moving and endearing. It's an inside look into the heart and soul of one of America's strongest leaders.BUT, editorally, I did think it was slightly disorganized. I would have enjoyed it more had it maintained a chronological flow. I had to take away one star for that.As for the last reviewer who feels the Reagans are just out for $$- he or she obviously did not read the prologue where Nancy reveals that she is donating proceeds from the book to benefit the Alzheimer's Foundation and the Reagan Library."
5,a book all woman will love and all men should aspire to be this loving!,"I always knew I liked Ronald Regan from what little I knew about him, but after reading this book, I fell in love with just how much he loved Nancy. I shed so many tears and felt his love for her in the deepest place in my heart. To be so loved and charished by a man is something all woman desire.This is the best book ever, and all men should read this also, maybe they can learn how to have a deep love and express it to a woman. I asked my boyfriend of 15 years to write me a love letter expressing his feelings. If I get 1/10 of the love that nancy got, I'd be happy."
1,unless it's free,"The book was free that's why I got it, otherwise I wouldn't recommend spending that much for a book of love letters, unless you are a Reagan fan."
1,As bad as it gets,"It is a tribute to the narcissism of Nancy Reagan that she published these letters, which reveal how infantilized our ex-president was in this cloying relationship, and how insipid his mode of expression when he didn't have his speechwriters handy. I know many people will think this is love, because Ronnie and Nancy call it that again and again and again and again, but really there are better words for it: pathological dependence, adolescent longing, Hallmark Card sentimentality. For those who take Ronnie's clinging neediness at face value--there is no reason not to--they might reflect on what a venal, shallow, and mean-minded person Nancy Reagan is. Doesn't the quality of a man's love depend at least in part upon the worthiness of the object of that love?"
1,Dear Mommy Poop Pants,"What grown man would refer to his wife as ""Mommy Poop Pants""? This is infantile stuff."
1,Anything For A Buck!,"How typical this book is of the Reagans. During their term in the White House the Reagans made no secret of their love of money, and after Reagan's term of office was over he would go anywhere and appear before any group -- regardless of ideology -- so long as the paycheck was big enough. Since that recourse to riches is no longer possible, Mrs. Reagan exploits her ill husband by publishing his personal letters to her over the years. Why? The letters provide no new insight into Reagan's personality. It's been common knowledge for decades that Reagan was emotionally dependent upon Nancy. There's no reason for this book other than to cash in and make a quick buck.How sad."
1,Wow. Shocking.,"Wow. I had no idea that Reagan wrote so childishly over and over and over again. His emotional maturity seemed to be stunted at 14. He seems to think that romance is love. Some pretty pathetic stuff here - ""Nancy Poo Pants"" ?People obsessed with him with love this, people who hate him will not even pick it up. It certainly will help, however, in the public relations camapign being waged to make people feel sentimental and sympathetic and replace that with reason and objectivity in assessing the genuine achievements of this good Chief Executive.I think that the real hero in all of this is Nancy Reagan. She is the one who had to carry the emotional and adult aspects of their entire existence."
5,I Was More of a Daughter to Ronnie than Patty or Ron...,Listen. We women can get very jaded when it comes to men. They aren't as romantic as they used to be. Our culture has encouraged that. Read this book and see how romantic and in love with pure dignity with Nancy was our great president Ronald Reagan.
5,Sweet and Touching,"This book has a great mixture of pictures of old letters and cards, transcripts of several letters, and some biographical information. It's full of charm, very natural and flows easily. It's overall a wonderful look at Ronald and Nancy Reagan private life with some truly touching letters from President Reagan. If you like history, the Presidents, the Reagan's or just a sweet love story, you'll like this book."
3,I did like the inside view,"I am on a quest to leave reviews for a bunch of books I have read recently. This book, ""I Love You, Ronnie"" was a touching inside view of a President and the woman he loved. I have to say it became a little boring in the middle because you can only appriciate the gushy pet names and adoration. Overall, it is a good read and I do recommend it as a check out from the library. I didn't spend the money to buy it, I checked it out from my local library and listened to it in audio. Good book."
4,Isn't it Romantic,"These letters are a very private look into the Reagan marriage and are, at times, funny, sad, poignant, touching, and .. well, they are just loving. The letters (and narrative) are wonderful to read and give me hope that there are men out there can be expressive and emotional when in love. Some of the letters are reproduced/photocopied so you can see R.R.'s handwriting and ""doodles,"" and it makes him even more real and accessible. The book was a joy to read and would interest anyone with a romantic side."
2,so-so,"the cd I recieved has stamps from a public library. It looks like it was stolen somewhere, which is very unpleasant. The cd and the libretto should have been in a packing that was missing.Aprt from this, the cd's are ok."
5,Outstanding,"Eric Bogosian has a knack for creating great little monologues that completely suck you in. As unpleasant, or even repelling, as so many of his characters are, their tales are nonetheless engrossing, sharp, raw and extremely funny. You'll plow through this in no time, anxious to read each next monologue. And you'll be quick to pick it back up for a re-read too."
4,IT'S ONLY ME. BUT:,"nOT REALLY MY CUP OF TEA. ALEX ROCKWELL WON 2 AWARDS FOR THIS. BROKE WOULD BE WRITE ADVERTISES TO SELL HIS MANUSCRIPT FOR A MOVIE. AD DRWS OUT IS WACHO OLDER MOB RELATED PRODUCER WHO TAKES HIM FOR A RIDE. hERE AGAIN HUBBY ALEX ROCKWELL ONLY GIVES HIS WIFE JENNIFER BEALS MINNIMAL EXPOSURE IN THIS FILM. HIS WHOLE FAMILY IS IN THE FILM. IF YOU BUY JENNIFER BEALS STUFF, BUY STUFF AFTER SHE DIVORCED ROCKWELL IN 1996. SHE GETS MORE ACTION IN FILMS SHE DOE THAT HE IS NOT INVOLVED IN. JM"
2,Never again,"What a mistake I made purchasing this Samsung TV. I have had a bad experience with this product. I purchased it around the end of 2003 and after a year one of the color tubes went out, and needed to be replaced After about 4 months, just like that the television stopped working, due to a problem with the power supply circuit board.I will never buy another Samsung product and recommend everyone follow suit!This product gives Samsung a bad name for all its products."
4,THIS TV IS AWSOME,The only problem I have with this TV is that when in compnent 1 HDTV mode through charter I have to keep it in the cool 1 color setting. If I don't the color gets real bright then real dark in and out. Other then that this TV is great no complaints exspecailly for the (970) price tag I bought it at!!!!!!
3,Pretty good tv - some specific specs missing,"For me - this tv lacks two things.1. Theres no way to change the aspect ratio when the tv is receiving a 480p (progressive) input signal. This is bad when you want to watch a Simpsons DVD with a high quality signal and its stretching it to meet the dimensions of the tv rather than allowing you to change the aspect ratio to 4:32. Of the two component inputs, only one allows for both 480p and 480i - and with problem #1, you would periodically have to change the signal from a progressive to an interlaced, and therefore be required to use the only input that gives you a choice of signals. the other input is a straight 480p / 1080i input.I felt like i was having to calibrate it too often and the edges of my screen were blurry. I think the picture was quite good and the price was fab."
5,Want to be Gogolized?,"For anyone who wants to experience a deeper understanding of Gogol, this is a treasure of insightful thoughts by an esteemed Russian writer. You will not be disappointed."
3,Not bad for the price,"This is a cool MP3 player/hard drive for the money. It is simple to use and easily read by my computer. It does have a few minor problems that I don't like. It has a slow download time (USB not firewire), the screen has a minor uncontrolable dimming problem, and the control knob sticks a bit. The worst problem the player has is it doesn't like to play in the cold. If it is cold, it has a loud, continuous beep and give the message, ""ambient temperature too low."" It will not turn back on until it warms up, so it will not work well on a jog unless you live in Las Vegas. The player works best plugged into the wall. But with all the drawbacks, it still is pretty good for the low price."
4,Great bang for the buck!,"I'd give this a five star review if it only had USB 2 or Firewire. The review of March 3 is dead wrong - you CAN drag and drop and you don't have to put the music into some wierd format either. It plays MP3's just fine. And it sounds full and rich, too."
5,Christmas Gift for 13 Year old grandson,Excellant machine. Grandson has had no problems with it. We use it do download and upload from Windows XP. It is worth the money!
2,Only OKAY,"I like to listen to classical music, and the RCA Jukebox is NOT the right MP3 player for classical. It is very hard to hear soft music, as the volume does not go up very high. Also, it is easy to hear the noises on the hard drive. The mP3 player is very bulky. One of the worst parts is that it doesn't work if it gets cold. Even in the summer, it might not work in intense air conditioning. The soft ware that comes with the jukebox is also hard to learn how to use. You have to pay more to upgrade it if you want any of the advanced features! I would maybe try the iPOD mini instead. The 20 GB hard drive is really appealing, but I doubt that that much storage is necessary for the average user."
1,Poor excuse for a mp3 player,The cigarette lighter adapter that was shipped didn't work and it would power off after being fully charged.The player locks up frequently and is cumbersome to work with and the headphones didn't work either.The only thing worse than the player is the customer service.Avoid at all costs.
1,"to slow downlowding , gets frozen a lot",The downlowding is very slow because it is USB.It gets frozen a lot (I press restart an average of 2 times a day).There are only folders for in the Hard Drive Part Not The MP3.The Case it comes with is bad.The only good thing is the price.
3,USB,"You've got to be kidding! USB on a player with a hard drive this large? Better get used to L-O-N-G waits for downloads. Anything without Firewire (or even USB 2) shouldn't even be considered, unless you're buying solely on price."
2,Could not send music to the device,Everytime I tried to 'send to device' it kept saying I needed to download the upgrade 1057 version. after the upgrade it continued to say the same thing over again. i only had it for 6 days and could not get it to work. Can someone help understand what i may have been doing wrong. thanks
1,it's so sad when people haven't used iTUNES.,"So i wanted an iPOD. My poor Dad who only uses PC's didn't understand the difference, and bought me this for christmas.I was afraid to even open it, but i did. Yuck. I figured it was generated for the masses so hooked it up to my work laptop. (windows.) The software was so freakin wierd and backwards. I got it to work, transfered my iTunes files to it from my Mac. And it was ok. Not bad really, just not good. I swapped it. Traded it in and paid the little bit extra to get the iPOD. I plugged the iPOD into my mac. I took a quick shower, before my clothes were on 1327 of my favorites were loaded on, ready to go.If you don't have a Mac, and you're used to having to do 20 extra steps to get stuff to work, then this one is great. If you have ever used a Mac, give this one up. It's a nice macine. Looks good. Runs pretty good, but it's not worth booting up a PC for."
4,Too Perfect,"My Lyra worked out of the box, no problems with windows Xp as long as you follow the instructions. USB 1.1 is a litle slow but just leave it to transfer files over night and in the morning it will be done. Mp3pro playback is great because it gives more room to store other files. Summed up, the best you can get for the price you pay"
1,Pathetic,"Absolutely pathetic. The author lives in a fantasy world and expects everyone to fall for this crap hook line and sinker. The 'sash', the 'machine' and a young eighteen year old that is snatched from the Army cookhouse to be a member of an elite killing team. Oh pur....lease. All those that gave this anything above one star need to ashamed of yourselves and go back to reading about the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus and Harry Potter. You'll probably be raving about those as well and trying to get your kids into bloody Hogwarts! For Christs sake you lot...grow up."
1,ridiculous,"This guy is having us on. The book is well written (even if he has the annoying habits of repeating himself every now and then, and of being very self-indulgent) but the whole concept of these superior soldiers is a complete load of nonsense.Using the moves of ""the machine"", a secret martial art, his guys could take out any enemy soliders without them even seeing their movements -- all the untrained eye would see is a blur -- come off it, give us a break here!"
4,Good resource for writing resumes,"My husband has been unemployed for over a year and I thought it might be time to get a good, updated book for him to use as a resource to see if his resume might be the issue. The book gives many tips and ideas and does include sample resumes. I like how they show before and after resumes so you can compare what errors you may be making in your resume to the errors in the book. Another big piece of information was how you submit your resume and to NOT send out generic ones.I gave it a four star rating because the type/font in the sample resumes was so small and hard to read. I know I'm getting to the age of needing reading glasses but the font was itty bitty. Other than that I would strongly recommend this book for people looking a job."
4,Resume for Dummies Review,"""Resume for Dummies"" is an all-encompassing book that goes into great detail about the many different types of resumes and how they can best be utilized for specific job searches. The author gives real-world examples of how a certain resume should look as well as words to include or exclude depending on someone's work history.Included along with the guidelines and examples are tips for handling career changes, online job searches, and what you should know about about a job before composing a resume.Overall, I found the book very helpful and very easy to read. Though these days it is more about who you know rather than what you know, this book can hopefully help you get your foot in the door."
4,Resume help,"Another great ""for dummies"" book! I am about ready to graduate college and I need to polish my resume. This book has sound advice for marking yourself and avoiding those resume mistakes that can cost you a job. The book is easy to read, laid out well."
2,Not for New Graduates,"While well-written and superbly organized, this book poorly met the needs of a recent graduate looking for work outside corporate world. A downright depressing read for those looking for a first job (treated as a ""special need""), this book seems primarily designed for experienced sales and marketing professionals looking to move up in the corporate world. Those considering government work, having special needs other than ""too much experience"", or with a short work history should consider a different guide. (Incidentally, while the book left the impression I was unemployable, after ditching Resumes for Dummies, I was called for an interview on the first job I applied for.)"
4,satisfied,"I was quite shocked when i compared my old resume to the one i prepared using ""Resumes for Dummies."" There is a definite difference. I feel for the better. Overall, i thought the book was pretty darn good."
4,A big help!,I wasn't sure where to really begin with writing a resume and this book was a big help! I recommend it to anyone who is a beginner with resumes.
2,Mediocre. The sample resumes look awful.,There are some good points and some silly points in this book. The sample resumes (Chapter 19) look awful. Look elsewhere.
1,Disappointing - I think I'm more of a dummy now!,"I would think that the 30 year old antiquated approach to resumes would be dead by now. This book is just rehashing the same old boring stuff that has proven not to work over the years. I would have thought this book in this well known series of books, would have some new ideas, formats, and concepts to give a job seeker a COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. But no, it offers nothing new but the same mundane stuff. Terribly disappointing"
4,Better for Revision than Preparation,"For résumé creation my book of choice isResume Magic: Trade Secrets of a Professional Resume Writer, but job seekers looking for something shorter to help them dust off and brush up an existing résumé may be better served by this book. All the conventional wisdom is presented in friendly, accessible language complemented by the well-indexed and highly scannable Dummies format. Nothing groundbreaking, but also nothing disagreeable - no complaints."
4,"Not only for fresh-grads, middle management and career change examples included.","Having been out of college for over a decade and working fulltime, we often don't realize that our resume format is out of date. This guide gives examples across a number of industries for more experienced professionals and others in the middle of their careers as well as the usual resume advice for those fresh out of school.Not only does this guide provide examples of resume formats in a range of industries, it also gives very basic instructions on electronic filing and formatting for those unfamiliar.There are many books out there better suited for fresh-grads packed with resume, cover letter and career advice but for those in middle-management and above, this guide is definitely worth a look."
5,Good old library book.,"I like the book, it's helpful in many ways. I particularly like the lists of useful action words and the examples of resumes and cover letters. That's why I bought it. It goes a little deep into the internet part of job searches but perhaps thats useful for some people."
4,A classic astrology guide.,"A deep, thorough astrology text. An interesting tool for budding astrologers as well as anyone interested in human psychology. Some passsages are so beautifully worded as to deserve the term 'poetic' and there are also good poems! (Especially ""Saturn""). This differs from some astrology guides in that it doesn't gloss over the personal lackings that particular planetary positions may show in individuals. For instance for 'Venus in Scorpio' it says 'Everything about the love nature needs regeneration and reorientation' and for Saturn in Cancer: 'An ambitious and shrewd person to whom material things are very important.' Perhaps a bit brutal and offensive or do we need these home truths?"
4,gift for mom,"I bought this book as a gift for my mother who has recently become very interested in all things mystical, spiritual and astrological. She seems to be enjoing it very much"
1,The worst kind of old-fashioned astrology...,"I bought this book, but soon got rid of it. I am frankly amazed at all the five-star reviews here. The book seemed to me to embody the worst aspects of old-style astrology - linking up horoscope patterns with superficial character traits in a way that will not impress anyone familiar with the existing statistical research into the topic. Give me Greene, Arroyo or Sasportas any day - unlike Hickey, they write at a level of psychological depth where astrology actually makes compelling sense.If I remember right, Hickey's book predicts that the lost continent of Atlantis would rise from the waves during the 1980s. Did I miss something?"
5,Good Value,The download worked fine and was of good quality. It was nice to get the songs I wanted quickly and at a fair price.
2,Where did they go?,"In terms of rating this CD, it looks like I am in the minority as the whole CD seems sort of ""sappy"". The title song ""Strange Time"" sounds like something written for a made-for-TV movie and this weak theme lasts throughout the entire CD. I have followed this group since the mid-60's, have all of the original LPs and CDs and listen to them often but this was a real dissapointment. In their old age they may have lost the spark and most of this stuff belongs on easy listening radio stations. Good God - I hope they are not writting their material for the Baby Boomer set - does this mean we are getting old?"
2,Elevator Music,"I'm really surprised at the number of great reviews appearing here for this CD. I am a huge Moody Blues fan, and I own all of their albums, and I had high hopes after the abysmal ""Keys of the Kingdom"" CD. I keep listening to Strange Times hoping I like it better with continued listening, but I don't. I can barely get through most of John Lodges elevator music, and there isn't really a standout song on the whole CD. I really think these great reviews are a result of lowered expectations. After ""Keys"" I agree that ""Strange Times"" is better...but not by much. Where is Mike Pinder when you need him?"
4,Modern Moodies Redeemed,"The Moody Blues have redeemed themselves and proved that one of the great progressive bands of the past is still alive. Strange Times is a modern example of how the Moody Blues can apply their unique talents to bring about something great without bowing to the mainstream. The previous three albums (The Other Side Of Life, Sur La Mer, Keys Of The Kingdom) reflected the pop themes at the times of their release but this seemed to squelch the unique Moodies quality.Strange Times triumphs as the foursome preserve the best of the old and set their course for the future. Why only 4 stars? I expect the next album to be even better."
3,"Lovely to see you again, however...","A good personal effort by the band (no producer). Once again, the theme of the CD is reinforced at the end, like many of their various releases.HOWEVER, their show to support the CD at Starplex in Dallas, Tx. was a quasi-disappointment. NO ORCHESTRA! NO ORCHESTRA! To see the band stand with their heads bowed as the tape plays the recorded orchestra is just embarassing. The limited number of songs they played with no orchestral backing were very good (""The Voice"", ""The Other Side of Life"", etc.). I will only see them again if it is guaranteed they will be with orchestra."
2,What A Waste Of Time,"I've been a hardcore Moody Blues fan since 1971. I have everything they've released and have thoroughly enjoyed their music, up to now. Strange Times is a boring album. There's more energy in a snail than there is to this album. There are a couple of good songs on it like English Sunset, Walking On Air, and Nothing Changes, but that's about it. John must have been asleep the whole time they were recording this. Either that or he just wasn't in to it. Even on some of Justin's tunes, he sounded half asleep or he just couldn't come up with anything to write about. Ray's 1:40 second contribution was a big disappointment after all these years of nothing contributed. In my opinion, the album is a waste of time. It is slow and boring. The only reason I have it is because it is a Moodies album and it goes with the collection. Otherwise I would not have wasted my time and hard earned money on this album that shouldn't have been made in the first place."
2,*** Please read this Justin Hayward & other Moodies ***,"Put away all the electronica and get out your acoustic guitars, real drums and flute. Go sit under a beautiful, starlit sky next to a crackling campfire and challenge yourselves. Slow down, breathe. Go back to your roots and let's have an album like the days of old. I know you can do it. LOVE"
1,"Never mind, you've acquired immortality 30 years ago!","I got this CD by mistake. What a sad decline. Although I gave it several listenings, not a single track caught my attention (though some are worse than others). Compare that to their 70'soutput, in particular (in that order) to the downright wonderful""Every good boy deserves favour"", ""To our children's children's children"", and ""A question of balance""! What unsurpassed combinations of rythm and melody they were. I get more kicks out of every song on these three albums than I get on the whole of ""Strange days"" (namely none). I urge the younger folks (I'm 44) that gave ""Strange days"" 4 to 5 stars: Go backto the seventies and than re-evaluate your rating! If you stillstick with it, there's something seriously wrong with you."
4,WOW,"Thankyou moody blues. I may only be 13 but i know some good music. this isn't my favorite album, i listen to more nirvanaish stuff, but still, this is just amazing. i love it!"
4,CLASSIC MOODIES,"I have been a moodie for many years, so I have to tell you I cried when I heard this new cd. It is sooo lovely creative--upbeat. I'm not easily impressed, but I know that John, Justin, Ray and Graeme must be so pleased with this new release. On Sept. 16, I had the ""DREAM OF MY LIFETIME FULLFILLED. I saw the Moody Blues in concert. I cried when they sang "" I KNOW YOUR OUT THERE SOMEWHERE."" After the show Justin, And John signed an autograph for me. thank-you gentlemen for more than 30 years of wonderful music that has made me smile, cry and sigh. GOD BLESS, AND BE WITH YOU WHEREEVER YOU MAY GO."
4,Well Worth the wait,"having read the reviews of Strange Times before i purchased it .I really didnt know what to expect. But after listening to it a few times I feel as though these are the moodies and this is what they do best. I can recall when"" on the threshold of a dream"" came out when i first heard it i thought man they went downhill then after a while it was a pleasure to listen too .So to those of you who dont think this is a not-so-hot release give it a chance and remember for 30 years they have given us much more then we could ask for... lets give them the chance Thanks"
4,The Moodies are back,"After being so disappointed by the lackluster and boring Keys of the Kingdom, Sur La Mer, and The Other Side of Life, I figured the Moody Blues' well had run dry. So I was pleasantly surprised by Strange Times. The lyrics are intelligent and moving, melodies are memorable, and arrangements are intricate. The only complaints I have are that more Ray Thomas songs should have been included--My Little Lovely is great, why stop there--and John Lodge needs to rock more! Too many slow songs by him."
5,Strange Times (Moody Blues),Absolutely outstanding CD ! One of their best ever! 90% of the songs on this CD would make the top 40 if the radio stations would start playing it.
3,How much does Justin Hayward have to pay these guys?,"Lets face facts! Justin Hayward is the Moody Blues. The others are just riding his coat tails and have been for the last 20 years. This album could have been vastly improved if it had bagged the Lodge, Thomas and Edge input.If you choose to compare it to the traditional Moodies albums (Days of Future Past through Seventh Sojourn) it will disappoint you. If you compare it with the last few outings, it is on par with ""Sur le Mur"". The best tracks are the Hayward tracks (of course). However, if you have not bought Justin's ""View from the Hill"", you should buy that one first. It is excellant and won't disappoint you."
2,Strange Times - Dud!,"I have been a 'Moody Blues' fan since 1969. I have enjoyed most of their music and loved their early works. Saw them perform many of the ""Strange Times"" pieces in concert at Jones Beach, July 22nd, and was thoroughly disappointed. While I admit the quality of the CD is excellent, the songs still lack the mystical voyage quality associated so lovingly with the group's work we've come to enjoy so much over the decades. I detected on the CD the inability at times to hit the high notes which was sadly very obvious in their live performance, also. They sound tired, and maybe after all these years of such great compositions and performances, they are. I am going to put ""Strange Times"" in the back of my collection and allow myself to stick with their best work from stranger times (no pun) - the 60's, 70's & 80's. They are still the greatest of groups, just this work is not one of their best."
2,Average for a band capable of much more,"I've been a Moody Blues fan since 1974, and have seen them in concert numerous times. I must say however, the last two CDs were sub par. I played this CD twice since I got it 3 months ago, and it is now sitting in my CD rack collecting dust. The lyrics do not show much thought; there's nothing all that great about the music either. There isn't even one song that jumps out and grabs me on this CD. This appeared to be a ""We're running out of money so let's make a recording"" kind of thing. Disappointing to say the least."
5,Strange Times is a breath of fresh air for Moody Blues fans.,"As a long time fan of classic Moody Blues, I am floored by how much I this new installment. In fact, I think it's their best album since 'The Present'. Excellent sound quality that doesn't seem ""over-produced"" and fantastic songwriting were a couple of things that came to mind as I listened to it.This might sound strange, but the opening tune: 'English Sunset', invokes a feeling in me that is hard to describe. Kinda like something inside of me wants to yell: ""YES! It's 1999, The MB's are back and sound phenomenal""!Ray Thomas' effort: ""My Little lovely"" perfectly combines new and old Moody Blues style songwriting in a classic way that only Ray can deliver.Srange Times is indeed a step forward for the Moody Blues and deserves a good listening to by any MB's fan or any fan of good music in general. -Frank"
3,"Yeah yeah, I know the Hayward/ Lodge team...","...are like the skipper and XO of the Moodies. But the problem is that their writing tends to match up so well (as witness the ""Blue Jays"" album) that it isn't always that easy to tell their individual work apart. The net effect is that this album sounds almost like the product of one mind. The one song by Ray Thomas (""Little Lovely""--sounds dedicated to the daddy's girl in the Thomas household) and the mostly-spoken Graeme Edge recitiation only point up the fact that the other twelve numbers dominate. Out of 14 songs, we should have gotten at least one more by Thomas. And you know something? It's not until now that I realize how much I miss Mike Pinder."
4,TASTY,"Being a eager fan of their music up to 7th Sojourn LP,I lost interest in them due to their dry,and listless music which seem to characterise all these old worn out bands that still try to milk their fans before retiring to Las Vegas.Then I attended their show at the Universal Ampitheatre in Los Angeles and I was blown away ! What a KILLER show. I was impressed by the energy and class that they put forth. After the show, I scurried down to Tower Records and got the album.Though not their best, I really enjoy the effort.The feel that I used to get when I listened to their earlier stuff has come back. A definite strong and tasty collection of the Moody Blue sound.These guys have come back from the dead and we all said ""Amen"""
5,"""Strange Times"" Worth the Wait!!!!","The Moody Blues new album ""Strange Times"" was worth the long wait by fans. This album is terrific!!! It is reminiscent and progressive at the same time. The music is clean, and the melodies have you hooked in no time. Justin Hayward again proves his prolific stamina as a singer and songwriter. John Lodge awes the listener with his lyrics and melodies. Also included are the eagerly awaited return of Ray Thomas (My Little Lovely) and Graeme Edge (Nothing Changes). If you are a Moody Blues fan this album is a ""must have"". ""Strange Times"" is a musical statement that the Moody Blues, as a band, are indeed alive, well and ready to enter the next millenium!"
2,It's Just Not On....,"Even as a long time fan, ""Strange Times"" is a major disappointment. Justin Hayward's contributions are okay but certainly nowhere near the quality exhibited in his recent solo work (View from the Hill). I listened to it the album twice but nothing truly remarkable.It was nice to see that Ray Thomas was allowed to make a contribution again. However, John Lodge's contributions largely detract from the album. I couldn't listen the whole way through any of his maudlin songs. I certainly agree with another Amazon review that John Lodge needs to leave the singing to Justin & Ray.If you're a fan, you'll probably buy it anyway. Otherwise, ""Strange Times"" is just not on."
1,once great band reduced to schlock,middle of road schlock. My favorite band from the 70's putting out music that is neither tuneful or artistic. nothing here that demands a second listen. disappointing from start to finish.
1,"Moody Blues, Strange Times have happened!","What gives?The boys of Moody Blues have always been known for melodic sounds and originality- along with positive lyrics?While there are hints of the positivity in songs like ""English Sunset"", I am very disappointed in the ending track ""Nothing Changes"" and the Overtly pop-style of songs like ""Haunted"".If you want the Moody Blues at their best, I suggest going back to their ""Days Of Future Past"" cd and going no later than their ""Time Traveler"" box set from 1994."
1,The gods have betrayed me...,"What a nothing disc, incredible that I found not a single worthwhile track on this disc making me want to hang on to it. I'm afraid the The Moodies have seen their day as their past few releases have proved. Last really good Moodies disc? 72/Seventh Sojourn, in fact any 70's period disc is better than this new one. In my opinion, the Moodies suffered a huge blow when original keys player Mike Pinder left the band. They haven't been the same since although I admire them for slogging onward. Old fans- Beware!"
5,Moody Blues still going strong,"This album is amazing and a long awaited one. It's become one of my favorites very quickly. The harmonies are reminiscent of early albums but the music is very much that of today. They have grown and changed as a group and it shows in the music. Hard core fans who think they should have stayed the same as they were in the sixties and early seventies won't like these new songs, but frankly, this is where the music was meant to go. The beautiful lyrics and voices of these men is astonishing and I hope they release many more like this for years to come."
5,Once apon a time - They have done it Again,"Absolutly their best album yet - not a really bad song in the album. While it doen't quite seem to have the ""sound"" of the original Moodies and it does feature Justin a bit too much, it still has much of their original sound in ""The One"" and ""English Sunset.""Their lyrics, to me, are magical and dreamlike- the same qualities that were in ""Once Apon a time, In Your Wildest Dream"". I can play their CD over and over without ever tiring of it.My favorite is ""Beautiful, Glorious, We Were Riding on a Wave"" A really pretty love song that speaks to me in many ways.Robert L. Anderson 391 Pleasant Ridge Ct. Saline, MI 48176e-mail: W8KZM@provide.net"
5,It GROWS on you!,"After reading a few of the other reviews, there seems to be a similiar theme - this new CD really begins to grow on you! With each listen, there really is a feeling of discovery - and old memories. New, yet very, very comfortable. It's like taking an old blanket out and wrapping yourself up. I'm very disappointed in the lack of sales Strange Times is generating. It's almost heartbreaking, because this really is for any and all Moody Blue fans...so every one of you out there who haven't taken the step - BUY IT!!! I also agree with a few of the other reviews - MORE RAY THOMAS! Plus - My personal favorite is 'Walk on the Water' - Having Ray, Justin and John sing on the same tune - HEAVEN!"
2,SUB-STANDARD GENIUS,"I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH ""STRANGE TIMES"" AS IT NEVER SEEMS TO GET GOING! THE FIRST TRACK -""ENGLISH SUNSET"" IS AN ABSOLUTE GEM AND WILL POSSIBLY BECOME A CLASSIC-BUT AFTER THAT I FOUND THE TRACKS GENERALLY DETERIORATED BUT NONE THE LESS I PLAY THEM ALL THE TIME! LONG LIVE THE MOODY BLUES.HEAD TEACHERS REPORT:-CAN DO BETTER!"
3,"more ray,bring back the mellotron,less of john lodge songs","simply put this cd has some fine songs-justin,ray, and some real losers john lodge songs. the older cds late 60's early 70's were truly the best work this doesn't come close. two suggestions=more ray thomas songs to go along with justin and how about a moodies christmas album. maybe the band was right-'you can never go home anymore'-every good boy deserves favor lp 1971. i grew up with this group and always remember the great music and the great moments of life through their music. theyare THE SINGERS IN A ROCK AND ROLL BAND."
4,Strange Times Review,"I found this to be an excellent collection of songs. I would like to see (and hear) more songs by Ray Thomas. I recorded Strange Times to a cassette for the car, and there was room for one Michael Pinder song. Makes it almost like ....."
5,Worry-Free Family Finances,After years of trying to pick stocks on my own I have finally figured out how to make money in the stock market. The last 3 years have yielded gains of over 25%. Thought so much of what he said I flew to Los Angeles to hear him speak. I bought several and gave them to my friends. Every year I get his list of America's Finest Companies.
4,Excellent value for your money,It is very good multi-meter and feel more sense comparing to digital one. It is good quality and excellent value.
1,Elenco multimeter kit,This item just for the student to learn how the multimeter work and read the diagam circuit.The multimeter is bad quality. the measurment of Alternating current and ohm are incorrect.Design of the diagram may be Incorrect.I need to change the resistors'value to find out what' problem. If you want to buy a multimeter to work.Please forget it. do not buy the trouble
4,Kit,The kit is very informative and the direction are so easy you do have to use math at all on series or parallel resister circuit installs.You just follow the pictures mainly. Also pay very close attention to the pot switch. It doesn't go on the resister side of the board.Other than that it pretty easy. Don't overload the solder and make sure you dial pas have no solder on them you good to go.I measured all the resisters before install and the margin of error is higher than the package says they are. I had 6-7% +\- on over half of them and the book said 1-2% +\-. so that is the really solid error I found with the kit. The other thing that I found was that my soldering iron had to be set to 3.5 out of 5 to lay the solder and it didn't stick to good. My suggestion to fix that is to wipe the board down really good with alcohol and flux all the pads.Good tool
1,This is NOT a kit..,"The product description and pictures of a kit are inaccurate. The meter arrived fully assembled, probably in China. This was a disappointment. If I had known it wasn't a kit even though the words and pictures said it was a kit, I wouldn't have purchased it. On the plus side, it does come with a zippered black vinyl case that has room for the test leads and a folded paper manual. Included was a new 9V battery in good condition, and a set of two AA batteries that were leaking electrolyte."
5,The best in the series,"I honestly wasn't sure who the killer was until the last few pages. Also, if you like Godwin you will really like this book. He gets some great news!"
3,Filipino Fury: Death Angel,"I was so happy to learn that Death Angel put out an album earlier this year. But I was a bit disappointed that Gus Pepa was not in their current line-up. Who is this Ted Aquilar?The tracks are solid and heavy. Rob Cavestany sure has mastered writing down writing lyrics that would rival Metallica's James Hetfield.My only regret is that they tried too much to be like their current label mates at Nuclear Blast Records. Gone are the days of the Ultra Violence and Act III, which are probably the most ingenius albums of heavy metal. But don't worry folks, this band still kicks Metallica's last album. Not bad for a band that was once produced by Metallica's Kirk Hammet."
1,14 years and this is what we get!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can't explain how terrible this album is. Nowhere near what they accomplished in the past. Singing is bad in which the members trade off songs. Weak riffs, drumming is lame. I can't believe they got back together and produced this piece of crap. Album should be called ""'The Art of staying Dead' So dated and boring I can just go on and on. SAVE YOUR $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
3,Who really needs this?,"Another strange comeback from a Thrash Band that didn't made it in the 80's.Does anyone really needs an album full of recycled old Formulas and average Songwriting?If so,go and buy this one!"
3,"nothing to remember, much",another comback and another lackluster cd.I find not much impressive with this cd.I liked the old death angel but this is nothing better just 10 plus years laster and the new stuff in not that good.
4,"Not ground breaking, but a must have","A number of years ago I saw the Thicker Than Blood video on headbangers ball and absolutely loved it. I really wanted to pick up the CD, but couldn't find any reviews, or sound clips of the other songs or anything. I later found it at Best Buy and I had to choose between it and Slayer's God Hates Us All. Unfortunately, I chose Slayer. I listened to that album about 2 or 3 times and couldn't get into it. Now that I finally have this album, I severely regret not buying it sooner. I absolutely love the vocals. I would highly recommend this to any fan of thrash."
3,good....but the market is dryed up,"I was excited to hear releases from old Thrashers Exodus,Death Angel,and even Nuclear Assault,but the days of thrash are still gone.These were all solid releases with excellent production and some good songs,but most lack the originality and creativeness that the old songs had.Plus most of these guys being in there 40's doesnt leave much of a future,most of the music seems to just be going through the same old motions again and again.The songs on this album for the most part are fast but repetitive.I really use to like the singer from Death Angel,but now when i listen to him i can't help but think wow he sounds just like the singer from Great White.This stuff IS better than anything Metallican't has put out for years.At least these guys can still rock,even if it is a bit mundane and out of style."
3,Nice Riffs,"Keeping in mind that the heydays of the 80's are gone, the fact is people are craving some decent guitar driven music. This is an extremely decent album that could benefit from a little better production/ songwriting. I'd rate this 3.5 stars overall.Super guitar work on this from beginning to end, fast tempos, thrashy at times but has a cool groove also. Vocals are a bit wierd but seem fitting to the songs the band are projecting.Not having been familiar with this band 15 + years ago I rate this on it's own merits.I do have to disagree with the reviews that say this album fizzles out at the end- to the contrary- that is where the heavier guitar/catchy tunes are. Just check out Land of Blood, No, or Spirit. Word to the Wise is different but a damn good closer.This is still better than the poor, half baked garbage shoved down our throats the last 10 years. At least these guys can play!"
5,"4.5 stars, but I'll gladly give them that extra half","Death Angel- The Art of Dying (2004)1. Thrown to the Wolves *****2. 5 Steps of Freedom *****3. Thicker than Blood *****4. The Devil Incarnate ****5. Famine ****6. Prophecy *****7. No ****8. Spirit *****9. Land of Blood *****10. Never Me ****11. Word to the Wise ****Standouts:Thrown to the Wolves5 Steps of FreedomThicker than BloodProphecySpiritAll perfect songs. Fast, aggressive, and catchy.Weak points:The only weak points are the verses of The Devil Incarnate and Famine because they are a little too slow. Still good songs though.Bottom Line:Incredible comeback album and definitely their best to date! Any thrash fan will love this nearly perfect album.Rating:9/10"
3,Missed opportunity,"A friend lent me his copy. This is a compilation from 2 recordings that were originally issued as Quadradisc (CD-4) vinyl recordings and later issued as regular stereo. The performances are all fine and you cannot go wrong if you like the works on here. The ""missed opportunity"" I refer to was not issuing them as a 4-channel SACD, a DTS-CD, and/or as a DVD-A. The last 2 could have been played on any home theater sound system without the extra expense of a special SACD player. Thereby, getting the chance to hear these works as they were originally intended to be heard. The 3 stars is for that missed opportunity."
3,To much Hype,"Wolfenstein was not at all like I expected it was way to medal of honor like no stratagy involved at all and the enemies were way to predictable, On my Halo scale this game gets a 3."
4,Solid Game for the x box,"a little too complicated at times inside the castle with all the dim lights, but eh, its staregy in which im not used to.graphics- 4/5gameplay- 3/5configuration 3/5replay- 4/5scenary- 3/5overall- solid 4/5 (must-buy for any WWII or medal of honor fans!!!)"
2,Better on computer,"If you want to play RtCW, buy it for the PC. It's exactly the same game with a different subtitle but you can play online for free. The single player is decent but Activision didn't even bother copying Halo in the co-op mode. When you play co-op you can only play missions that you've gotten to in single-player. That means that if you almost beat the game with a friend and you quit, you have to start from the beginning the next day. Why wouldn't they let you even save co-op in a different profile?"
3,Good- but not what I thought,"Being a big fan of World War 2 shooters (Medal of Honor, Call of Duty) Wolfenstein seemed to be a good, accurate game. You start off fighting in North Africa, blasting your way through a nazi held town. Soon after comes a tomb or something where a nazi expedition uncovers an ancient curse, and from there it is all downhill. Zombies with poor AI start apearing everywhere, killing you and the germans. When you get out your commander says simply: ""The zombies were...truely unexpected.""in the cheesiest punchline I have ever heard. The nazis begin experementing with cloning and build ""Super Soldiers"", which even in easy skill are impossible. Sure, Himmler was involved with the occult but this really overdoes it..."
1,Maybe worth it with Xbox Live...no way without!,"The game has three modes; Online Vs, 1 Player Story, and 2 Player story.I don't have Xbox Live, so I can't comment on the vs mode other than to say that the manufacturers really could have included a 2-4 player vs mode that those of us without Xbox Live could enjoy.The one player game is OK, but no where near as good as its fellow WWII competitor, Medal of Honor. The one advantage that this game has over M.O.H. is that you can play the story mode 2-Player co-operative. Which brings me to the third mode of play.Two player co-operative: WHAT WERE THE DESIGNERS OF THIS GAME THINKING WHEN THEY DECIEDED NO ONE WOULD WANT/NEED TO SAVE THEIR 2-PLAYER CO-OPERATIVE GAME!?!?!?! I played this with a friend for around 4 hours when we realized we couldn't save our game. What a nightmare!So, like the title of this review says, maybe this game is good online, but it is essentially worthless if you don't have Xbox Live. Don't waste your cash."
2,mediocre ugly port,"Wolfenstein is a legendary frachise. First appearing on Apple before the time of the Mac...then Atari, DOS, Commodore64...ID software picked up the ball and Wolfenstein 3D became one of the first FPS (first person shooters)...leading into Doom, Quake, and the rest is history.Tides of War is an incredibly ugly, flat, lifeless, colorless and borish game. The graphics relative to other xbox games of it's era simply do not measure up. Very dissapointing.Quake3 Engine. Not the best."
2,hmm nazis can take a ... load of bullets,i had no idea a nazi could take 15 machine gun rounds and an entire clip of pistol bullets. the flame thrower was my favorite part of the game. the multiplayer is fun and that is the only strength. Enemys are ridiculousy strong in my opionon. 2 stars for the flame thrower and multiplayer. (i would never buy this game i played the demo)
3,Probably good multiplayer,"This game is probably good when played over the Internet or when linking systems, it would probably be a lot of fun just playing death matches but the developers didn't think to include that little feature. I've only played the single player game so that's all I can fairly rate; I'd probably give it a 2 and a half. I don't have X-Box Live so I can't rate that aspect of the game nor do I have three friends with three X-Boxes so I can't accurately review the linking feature, all I can review is the single player mode and it is just OK."
1,Wolfenstein Faithful Disappointed,"Ok, I played Wolfenstein way back in the day and loved it. I was thrilled with the prospect of reliving the good old days on my XBox.Imagine my disappointment when I played this game. This has no intriguing plot like the original, the graphics are sloppy, the controls are almost ""Dead to Rights"" terrible, and the only good point of the game is the weapons.Apparently, the designers got lazy, then decided to market this waste of space based on a name and some updated weapons. Leave this one on the rack, especially if you are expecting something worthy of the Wolfenstein brand."
5,Amazing Game for its time. Still very fun though,I remember playing wolfenstein on my PlayStation 2. I have an Xbox 360 now and I saw this game and I couldn't resist it is still very fun and has a good campaign length. Hope this helps enjoy.
4,"Awesome, best Online game yet","I have been playing this game for about 6 months now, on xbox live. It is the best first person shooter on the market for which i have seen. True combat......"
5,ONE OF THE BEST XBOX RELEASES TO DATE,"The game's single-player component is extremely well executed. Some missions (like the airport) are so well designed that you will want to revisit them even when you finished the game.The multiplayer component of the game is just the finest Xbox gaming experience you are going to have for months to come. It's so much more realistic, action-packed and dynamic than anything else that's been released for Xbox so far.Overall, the game has superb graphics, sound, and story line. Definitely one of the best Xbox games released so far."
3,a word of caution,"I just got this game the other day and while I've not gotten very far yet, it's fun so far. The graphics are good and the controls intuitive.Big problem, though. You can't save your mission in cooperative mode. The main reason I bought this game is because I enjoyed the cooperative mode in Halo so much. I already have a single player WWII game in Medal of Honor so I was excited to be able to do 2-player on this. It's frustrating beyond belief to spend a couple hours working on the game with a friend and then just lose it all because you can't save it. Unless you are willing to sit down and play for 12 hours nonstop to actually have a chance at finishing the game, the cooperative mode is utterly pointless."
4,Muy bueno,"Este es un excelente juego para Xbox.Las graficas y el sonido son bastante buenos.Es cierto que no tiene una historia muy coherente que digamos, sin embargo cada nivel logra el objetivo de sumerjirte en la acción y te despierta el deseo de saber ¿Que pasará despues?Sin dudas es un juego que te hará pasar un muy buen rato."
2,Go to a different shooter,"This game has way below average graphics and sound. It has no real storyline. It's like an old doom game which were alright then, but should be much better now. The replay value is nothing great. Avoid this and go for any Tom Clancy stuff or Halo or many other shooters over this one. What a dissapointment."
5,Great fun!!,"This is the best online multiplayer for Xbox. There was some issues with lagging when it first came out, but now it seems to have greatly improved. The maps are fun and most are easy to figure out. I know that it is WWII, but they could have included a few more weapons. Buy this game you will not be dissapointed."
5,A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE,Provides a valuable case study on the history of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s.
5,A Living Saint,"John Lewis has been called a ""living saint"", he definitely deserves the title but when reading his book Walking With the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement you discover that he is as mortal as you and me.Hard to believe he is the only living speaker from the 50 year ago event that showcased Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""I have a dream speech"". Lewis was the youngest of King's inner circle and got his training on the ground.What I enjoy in this book is that Lewis shares the ups and downs of his life. From breaking out from his Alabama rural roots to the pain of losing King and Robert Kennedy to an assassin's bullet are all spelled out in this memoir.He also chronicles his public service career and the many competing interest that pull and push at him, all the while staying true to himself and doing the right thing.An insightful book of a man that is part of America's history, this is perfect for anyone who wants to be inspired and given that push to pursue their own dreams."
5,A True American Hero,"John Lewis captured the Spirit of America and the true motivation behind the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement in ""Walking With The Wind."" This book allows the reader to not only experience the movement, but to gain a better understanding of the issues and events that have shaped American history in the last half of the twentienth century. Brilliantly crafted, this book epitomizes the ""American Dream."" Highly recommended to anyone interested in American history or modern day hereos."
5,Americans struggling for simple dignity,"Americans struggling for simple dignity; for the rights all Americans were promised by the founding fathers, told complete with warts, with the power of a mover and eyewitness to it all. John Lewis treats us to an inside view of SNCC, its often turbulent association with SCLC, and it's ultimate demise from militant upsurters. He beautifully recounts students confronting both civil and bone-chilling authority with both success and failure.Riviting, and at once humbling as well as redeeming to know such heroic Americans exist that are willing to risk body and soul to defeat glaring wrong. Defeat wrong not by force, but by will power and moral courage. Americans at their best!A must read for every American, and an excellant companion to ""Parting of the Waters.Thank you John Lewis!"
2,Civil rights hero still lives in the past,"John Lewis is a genuine civil rights hero. This book begins by painting a clear portrait of the struggles that John Lewis fought and still fights for. Lewis' memoirs of the movement are very touching. However, the book lost me, towards the end, when Lewis argued in favor of his socialist political ideology. He engages in the politics of personal destruction against the likes of prominent conservative African Americans such as Clarence Thomas. He portrays the Republican party unfairly suggesting that they are a bunch of closet racists. As a republican and a civil rights advocate, I was offended. This book could have been a brilliant portrayal of the history of the civil rights movement. Instead, Lewis moves the premise of the book from history to the politics of personal destruction."
3,"Good picture, but too many problems over time",The main reason I am posting this comment is because I am looking for a copy of the original manufacturer's warrant for the HLN617W TV. I have had repeated problems with my TV and am trying to get reimbursed on a claim but I cannot find my original warranty card from Samsung. I have called Samsung and they claim to not be able to send out a copy (makes no sense to me.) If there are any owners out there that can send me a copy I would be greatful. John Burkert 4012 Dover Rd Durham NC 27707.
1,Repairs Kill you! Do NOT buy a DLP from Samsung!!,"I purchased the Samsung DLP TV with the 61"" screen. I've had so many repairs it makes me sick. I am getting a different TV this time. Three bulbs, a color wheel, a fan and now supposedly the ""Ballast"" whatever, I don't care. If I had not spent so much I should have thrown it out after the first repair. Really, I've spent 960 dollars on repairs! Call me stupid!! No More Samsung... Never! The picture was good, but it ain't worth it and they don't extend the warranty either... boy if your a few months past the year its curtains for you! I was an early adopter. I like to buy the best - no more Samsung, I don't care if they invent something new... I am not buying!"
3,Not so good,"DLP does not have good color contrast and black level, the black color on dark scenes came out as greyish/patchy shadow on the one I bought. The dark scenes are awful on the DLP. Tried to watch 28 Days Later on the DLP and the picture quality is just horrible. Looks like watching dot matrix picture quality. All these happens even though I have Monster component cables and progressive scan DVD player.The sales guy told me to move back my 6 feet viewing area and get the top level Samsung DVD player and use DVI cable, which will set me back 500-600 dollars more. Returned my DLP and got Sony Grand Wega XBR LCD. It's 300 bucks more if you bargain right plus it has the HDTV tuner built in and it's the same level of quality as plasma and the dark scenes on movies are excellent."
1,Can't play video games,"Everyone talks about how beautiful the graphics are on these tvs. Get an xbox with component output and you're in Halo Heaven. Try playing MVP Baseball or Top Spin on these pieces of junk. You'll find that the video and audio delay is too much to handle. Try swinging at a 95 MPH fastball and you'll find that the ball is in the catcher's mit before you even start to swing. Turns out that these digital displays require more video processing time. So they decide to delay the audio to match. Unfortunately all video gamers must now suffer from this. Any game that requires quick reaction time like stopping a moving line at a certain point on a bar is impossible. It's really sad that something this serious is often overlooked. I took my xbox to a circuit city and tried it on all the digital displays. They all had the same poor result. I try it on a cheap $200 tube tv and it's perfect. Not many people know about this, at least nobody I've talked to. So keep this delay in mind."
4,Beautiful Kettle!,"This is a top quality kettle. I think it is very heavy compared to ther kettles I have had. Color choices are awesome and it looks great w/ the coordinating grip in the same color! It wistles loud enough to be heard in another room, which is good!The only thing I have a problem with and didn't see mentioned in any other posts is my spout drips. It isn't that it is too full or the boiling water is splashing up. I think the condensation/steam collects there somehow and makes it drip a bit when it is boiling. Not too big of a deal. Any one else have this happen?Norma >^..^<"
3,"Pretty, but not as functional as I had imagined","The kettle is beautiful. It brightens up my kitchen and puts me in a happy mood whenever I see it on the stove.However..I was surprised that the handle of this kitchen aid got so hot! I have to use a rag to push the lever of the spout ""cap"" open. My old rusty kettle was better designed than this!"
5,very theatrical,"I heard this album from a friend's rare collection about 3 years ago. I was wondered by this enormous piece of interpretation/composition. Very dramatic, dark, instense... The electro passages could vanish the nightmares of my head.That's it."
3,OK i guess,I thought it was going to be like pig vs kmfdm. not really. the cd is ok but its not what i expected
5,Good Tempo,"I listened to other Souza offerings, both by the Marine Band and various symphonies. This CD comes closest to march tempo. Being a former Marine, as well as a band musician, it pains me to listen to marches played too fast.This CD sounds the best."
4,Good overall awareness,This book touches most laws and regulations which play a role in everyday life. Raises your awareness and could keep you from doing stupid things without gaining deeper information
5,No Sunday School Answers Here,"In Ken Samples' book, he takes us beyond simple Sunday school answers and takes us to the heart of questions that many Christian's either don't have good answers for or need help articulating such issues to unbelieving friends and family.Truly a must read book for any Christian."
5,Ms. Rowling strikes again!,"Loved the book, as well as the previous two titles in the Harry Potter series.These books are great for readers of any age -- fun, clever, but not too deep. Some mild violence, but no more than Saturday morning cartoons.Enjoy!"
5,Wow! This one was even better than the others!,"J.K. Rowling has done it again! This new book is absolutely wonderful. It's great for all ages, not just kids, and is just so much fun. The ending is very unexpected and the story is suspenseful. The plot is very detailed and once again we learn more about Harry's past and see him escape great peril. I can't wait for the next book!"
4,Great book.,"The book is definitely great. I used to own it, but I don't know what happened to it. I replaced all of the books that went missing, and bought the ones I never owned. I purchased the third book, and when it came... it was still the book, but with a completely different cover than was advertised. I thought it might have been the UK version, but it turns out it's the ""children's version"", or so my sister told me. Either way, the book is still the same. That's why I'm giving this rating a 4 star instead of 5."
5,Excellent!!,"There's no need for me to convince anyone that these books are wonderful, but I would like to point out that the true marvel of this phenomenon is that they are just *books*. There are no Harry Potter tie-ins, no movies, no Harry Potter action figures. I hope to always remember this --that in the last year of the technological century, people -- especially children --were so very excited about mere words on a page."
5,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,I chose this rating because it was one of the best books l have ever read. I will read it again and again.
5,This is the best book I've ever read.,These are the best books I've ever read. I have read all threeof them and have never read anything so brilliant in my life.
5,I could not put it down,"I read this book every night even when I was tired. This is the first book that I have read in the series, and it compelled me so much that I am going to continue reading the books."
5,A Splendifferous Book!:) FANTASTIC!!!!!!!,"This is a truly amazing book. J.K. Rowling really captures harry and his friends feelings. She is so creative when it comes to the wonderful wizarding world, have you ever imagined flying on the back of a mystcal creature called Buckbeak? I bet you haven't! In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, magic comes alive in a sense that your really there, worring about Sirius Black, struggling with endless stacks of homework and even hoping you won't bump into anyone under your invisabillity cloak. I would recomend this book to anyone who has ever loved adventure!!!:)from- A 12 year old reader."
4,A rollercoaster ride to another world!,"J.K. Rowling does a wonderful job of weaving a tale that is suspenseful,entertaining and insiteful all rolled into one! I have read every one of the Potter books and each time I couldn't wait to open the next. A wonderful book suitable for kids and adults."
5,harry potter and the chamber of secerets,"I'm 38 years old and never have read a book in my life I tired harry potter after hearing about it on the Rosie O'Donnell show I must say it is the best thing I have ever read in my life i wish I could have had this book when I was a child. I have read all 3 in the series of 8. I was trying to find out when book 4 would be realeased when I found this . I must tell you ,have your kids read this one it is great! When you frist begin it is kinda of slow but, you need this to get started ,in the future it will come in handy.To help you figuer out what is going to happen in the rest of the series.I have told everyone I know to read it and everyone is glad they did this book takes you away makes your imagaine run and you can't stop .I have read all three books in 6 weeks and hope there will not be a long wait for #4 to be realeased. Please read this one don't let it go by!"
5,The best book of the series!,"I don't agree with people who say ""These HP books don't have any depth because they are kids' books."" Not true. Every person and every age gets something different out of it. There are many subplots and things that are concealed. They are great and I can read them over and over again. This book is the best because of LUPIN. :)"
3,five star story. Two naughty words to delete for children,"One of the best fantisy series since Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately the author uses ""d**n"" and ""cr**"" as in ""I won't take any cr** from him"" in this one. D*m* was used in the others too. My nine year old loves to read these. So my advise is get the white out ready and be creative in your replacemnts. Rowling is too good an author to resort to such language even in a juvinile way. The storyline is top notch and characters wonderful. Just put the potty language away! If the naughty words were not there I would have given five stars. DLS"
4,getting thin,"i do love these potter books but now i kinda see why they seem to be appealing to children .the first couple of chapters are like the first couple of days of school that you spend the first few days i.e first few chapters reviewing what you have already learned.second if the aunt and uncle detest harry so bad why do they keep letting him come back for the summer can't harry live somewhere else.i got bored with this book and figured out what was not supposed to be figured till the end almost at the beginning at the book.it was good but sad and should have ended better kinda left me with this lingering question for a boy so extordinary why is it that he is forced to be so ordinary that is almost what people wanna get a way from to read a book where you have the power to be yourself EVERYWHERE and not in the confined spaces that define harry's character,but over all it is a great motivator and it is a book my brother has read....a great accomplishment believe me! ."
2,Good find but could have done better.,Great book but the description on the condition of it was a bit off. This was supposed to be a gift and even though I knew it was a used book there was too much damage to the entire book. The description said it had minimal wear on the cover and edges but they failed to mention the huge water stains and water damage to the entire book. I ended up keeping this copy for myself and just buying a new one for the person I was gifting.
5,"Lexie Stewart a 11 year old reader, Harry Potter Rules","I would say that this Harry Potter book would be the best because of the use of imagination by J.K Rowling. What happens is that a prisoner from Azkaban, Sirus Black is after Scabbers. But he is after someone else as well. Harry finds out Black has a secret.But he has another problem,that Hogwarts have sent to keep students safe, Dementors.I would say that people who like Fantasy books have to read this book."
5,An incredible book,This I grant you is a good buy. Its a book that starts off interesting from the very first sentence. It starts off with one of harry's typical Dursley problems then vaults him off to hogwarts where he comes to the magic and fun part of his adventure and then at every turn what you expect to happen does not happen. Theres always a twist and a turn at every corner. This book wiil keep you on your toes and begging for book #4.
5,Book Three By Far The Greatest,"Being the avid Harry Potter fan that I am, I love the four books Rowling has put out so far, but my favorite has to be ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"". This book stood out for me because of the great mystery and when you hit the last third of the book, you can't stop reading untill you reach the excelent end. The ending its self is a great example of profound writing skills. Just when you thought you knew everything about what happened to Harry's parents that night they died, your hit with the true story of who betrayed them to the dark lord. I would recomend this book to anyone looking for a great adventure as this series will be treasured as a true classic forever."
4,Harry Potte and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"I was very happy to receive a book in nice condition, in a timely manner, at a good price, and I look forward to reading it."
2,Why is it over 300 pages?,I was extremely disappointed with the 3rd book in the Harry Potter series. For me this book falls completely flat. It seems like a huge mosh of rantings which makes up the whole middle of the book. While the climax and ending takes only two chapters. This book did not need to be so long. I was even more disappointed because when I watched the third movie I found myself extremely confused and I was hoping I could follow the book more. I was wrong and the book was even less exciting. Needless to say this did not get me excited to read the next two books which are even longer.
5,Harry Potter and the prizoner of Azkaban,"These books really are as good as everyone say they are,I have read this book over 7 times and I still love reading itbecause learn something new every time I read it. But what this book really is about is Harry Potter a boy who accidently blows up his aunt and thinking he will get expelled from Hogwarts (his school)he runs away.Though out the book he is being watched by everyone in the school because they think Serius Black will murder Harry . This book is very good and don't set it down the first time you read though it. It took me all 7 times to know every little detail, and I am still not bored!!!! Soread this book NO ONE CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Disappointed,"I read the first two Harry Potter books, and I must say that I'm disappointed with the third. I know that this seems to be the most popular--especially with those I know--but I didn't enjoy this one as much. I gave the first two four stars each, so I couldn't give this one four, because in my opinion, it wasn't as good. The plot wasn't as strong and the ending was more of a let-down than the first two. The Chamber of Secrets is still my favorite, but I'm working on the fourth now, and so far it's the best yet. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a good book, yes, but in my opinion, not quite up to the level of imagination and brilliance of the first two. A good read, though. Can't wait for the fifth."
5,It is magically addicting,"It is so incredibley awesome! It didn't take me long at all to read it. It really is very addicting, especially when you get to the end. The end always has all the action, don't you think? The middle also has a lot of action, like Harry gets to ride Buckbeak, or Harry gets in trouble for roming around the school. If you decide to read the series, you will be amazed at how good J.K. Rowling is at writing and how well she makes it seem as though it can really happen. I just can't stop reading the series because it is so good! I even read it when I am watching my favortie television show. You will fall in love with it like me!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABANBy J.K.RowlingThis was an exciting book and I liked it the best of the Harry Potter series. Any Harry Potter fan should read this book because you find out things you wouldn't expect. In this book Harry discovers two wizard secrets: the wizard town Hogsmede and the Murderer's map. Two of my favorite parts were when Harry and Ron found something that had been in his family for years and when Harry scared the Dursleys.The only part I didn't like was chapter three, it was just about a flying bus.Harry meets some interesting characters, one of his teachers is a werewolf and Hermione has problems in school."
1,The 'Dumbing' Down of a Beautiful Genre,"Its really depressing to see what acclaim books like these seem to get these days. Don't get me wrong, I've read to of them (I am the book reviewer for my school newspaper), but I find the characters to be shallow, and without redeeming qualities. There never is a driving need, or quest, the main character merely deals with events as they come. The villians are fake and utterly unbelieveable, and now that publishers are seeing how successful Harry Potter has become, they are demanding that more books are written in its image and thus depriving the world of well written fantasy books. The 'dumbing' down of a genre, from the 'dumbing' down of a society. And I'm not even going to remark upon the rampant commercialism associated with this book. Harry Potter toothbrushes and shower curtains? Oh please."
1,Poorly plotted by comparison,"I thought the third book didn't stand up to the other two -- much more convoluted plotwise, and a bit contrived. The names were also a little too suggestive, and ruined the surprise"
1,It is terrable!!!!!!!!,"I think they're going to far with this book. It's the worst plot I've ever heard of. I think anybody who likes this book is in third grade or lower! It's defenetly not worth the paper it's written on. Please, burn the book. And it's not worth $9.97!!!!"
4,Definitely NOT a Bad influence,"I must say that as a devout Christian I find sensoring this book ridiculous. Surely others of you must realize that there is more violence in the book of Genisis alone than in the three HP books combined! Please Read this book! Let your children read it! Heck, encourage people on the street to read it! :)"
5,Great book for ANY age,"I must say my first experience with the Harry Potter world did not occur until I saw the first movie in the theatre (relutantly dragged by my mother and nephews). I was hooked from that time on. I left the theatre and went and purchased the books. This third book is truly amazing. I am not sure how JK Rowling was able to create in such depth the Harry Potter world, but it is spectacular. I would recommend this book for ANY age person. I have already read the series twice and am looking forward to reading it again soon."
5,The best yet in the Harry Potter Series!,"This is a fantastic addition to the Harry Potter series, the best of the 4 books currently available if you ask me! :) It has a fantastic plot (as do the rest, but this one is even better!). The dementors are a great addition to the book. The Prisoner of Azkaban has great messages for its readers, adult or child. Way to go JK Rowling! We can't wait for Book 5 to come out!!"
3,kids guidance,"it's the only book, in holland at least that keeps my oldest of ten years of age away pokemin and computing machines. The english writer seems lovely naive and correctly motivated top not like the before even reading: the kid makes you lisyten as if fgullivers travels were rewritten and tears in the dreams about all this Tolkien we find half a century later this book is a must: not so much for reading as more for giving as a nonprsent on jsu a sunny warm tuesday mornig to the first you see. Do it . Harry needs it. So do you"
5,The best so far....,"As noted by my Potterhead status, I do really love all of the books, but Azkaban has been my favorite so far. It introduces the reader to one of the best characters (in Sirius Black) and a great plot twist, plus action and adventure. This book had just come out when I decided to start reading the series (to see what all of the fuss was about, of course). By the time I got to the end of this installment, I was absolutely frothing at the mouth for the next book.I think PoA lays out the talents that Rowling brings to the table, and she is at full stide on this novel. As of this writing, we are counting down to book six (the penultimate in the series), and can only imagine where we are going next.See you at Hogwarts!"
3,Review on Harry Potter,The book I read was about a boy that has magic powers and he goes to hogwarts to control them and learn diffrent kinds of powers. He also has to try to figure out where the prisoner of Askaban was and he has to try to capture him. he does it to but he also turns into a warewolf before he does capture it.The boy in my book has black hair brown eyes and a lightning bolt on his fore head and circle glasses. He has a great personality and he never talks back to his friends. He sometimes does the wrong things to.Yes i did like this book. Because it was cool and it was kinda scary and i like scary books.When ever the prisoner turned into a warewolf. Yes I would recommendthis book to a friend.
5,WOW! JK Rowling at her best!,"This is my favorite Harry Potter book yet! The twists and turns the story has is amazing! Sure, book one had its own twist and I enjoyed it. But this one!!! WOW!!! We find out Harry has a godfather and the possibility that he can have a family is touching! We also find out a bit more about Harry's father and his friends. Georgous professor Lupin is introduced and Sirius Black is another fighter!!!! By far, my favorite HP book!!! Hopefully we find out some more about Harry's parents in the long awaited Book 5: The Order of the Phoenix! All HP books are a GOOD read and FUN FUN FUN!!!!!!!! They key word is: FUN!"
4,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST, BUT A VERY GOOD BOOK!","I enjoyed reading Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It made me feel like I was in his world. There is a lot of action in the book. I loved reading it. The new charactors in the book, are exciting to read about. When Snape comes along it gets exciting. It is a cool book!"
5,WILD ABOUT HARRY!,"I bought the 1st Harry Potter book for my 9 year old son, and we started reading it out loud. After he went to bed, I finished Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, staying up until 3 AM to do so, and couldn't wait until this book hit the stores. It was well worth the wait! Incredibly complex, wonderfully written, kept me guessing to the end. I can't wait to the next year at Hogwarts!"
5,A Whole New World in small great book-,"This is definitly the best out of 3 masterpieces. You get sucked into a magical world with spells, evil plots,and tons of action-packed adventure. Although it's a strange different world you can also relate to the characters. I would not recommed it for kids under 7, because it is scaary at parts. It's Totally Radical!"
5,The most magical book I've ever read!,"Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azakaban is a must read. I couldn't put it down. I read it in bed till late hours, I couldn't put it down at school and I read it when I was supposed to be doing homework! It is filled with adventures and I especially like the Quidditch games. The characters are very well written, (especially Hagrid)but my favourite character would have to be Ron!This is the best Harry Potter book yet!"
5,These books are too wonderful for words!,"The Harry Potter books that I have so far read have been the most wonderful, amazing, terrific, and most descriptive and creative books that I have ever read! I'm a gigantic Sci-Fi fan, and I think these stories are even better than those of the A Wrinkle In Time series(Sorry, Ms.L'Engle!) These are the best books in the world, better than Shakespeare!! I'm certain that these books and the ones to soon come out will definitely be a"
4,J.K.Rowling is so imaginative,"I gave this four stars instead of five because it wasn't my favorite book of the series, but I enjoyed the entire Harry Potter collection. I'm just in awe of the detail and humor that Ms. Rowling includes in her books."
5,Prisoner of Azkaban (audio book on CD),"With getting a newer car - one that accommodates CDs but not cassette tapes - my collection of the Harry Potter books was not playable. I had replaced all of them except Azkaban. I found this one on Amazon, advertised as ""new"". It arrived in three days and was in perfect condition. I'm a happy customer."
5,Very good book,"Lots of twists and turns, but they all come together at the end. Very interesting and unexpected finish. Well tied to the previous two books"
5,Rockin' Sirius Black!,Have been a fan of the movies and stories of Hogwarts. JK Rowling is a genius with her ability to craft her tales and characters. I wanted to have the books as part of my collection even though I read them all.
5,QUICK DELIVERY.....GOOD PURCHASE,"HAD FOUND ALL OF THE BOOKS EXCEPT THIS ONE...........GREAT DELIVERY, BOOK IN VERY GOOD SHAPE, MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS PLEASED.THANKS"
3,Fantastic!,"This is the third book in the Harry Potter series, and one of my favorites. Harry, back at another year at Hogwarts, finds out tht convicted criminal Sirius Black has escaped from prison, and is after him! Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through many adventures through their year at Hogwarts!"
5,A good book? YES!,"This is my favorite Harry Potter book because Harry learns something that is VEEERY IMPORTANT TO HIM. (.You'll have to find out WHAT that is.) A lot of this book is about Hermoine , which is good because she's an interesting charachter. Even though she is soooo busy with her school work she still helps hers friends. All through this book people are afraid of "" a certain person"" You think something terrible will happen to him but..........."
5,This a great fabulous wonderful awesome terrific book!!!!!!!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is just as good as the first two.I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT. It comes to the U.S. On September 8, 1999. It has already sold more than the other two and is number 1 one the best booksellers list. I can't wait for the fourth!!! It is too bad there will be only 7."
5,I love this book!!!!!,it was great. held my attention and i think harry is really someone i can relate to!!
5,"How I dug in to ""Harry Potter""","I'm not much of a reader but when I heard about Harry Potter, I decided to start reading it. I went to the library and checked it out, I've read all 3 of the Harry Potter books, and when I read them I just could not stop, I mean, you don't see normally see a book like that."
5,It was captivating.It held my attention until the very end.,It is a wonderful book and I highly recommened you to readit.but read the first two first.And I cant wait for the rest of them to come out.
5,I LOVE HARRY POTTER/SAVE IT FROM BEING BANNED,"As we all know, J.K. Rowling's world that has Harry Potter, is a wonderful and magical place. *The Prisoner Of Azakban* is definetly one of her best books. The story contains a more mature Harry, Ron and Hermione, returning to Hogwarts for year three. They encounter new and mystifing creatures, (the prison guards from Azakaban) while Harry starts learns more about his father, and his family. Harry also meets a potential ""love interest"". However, these books are in danger of being banned, thanks to ignorant parents that don't know what they're ""yammering"" about. (Note: South Carolina, parents want the stories banned.) SAVE HARRY POTTER!"
1,You smell that,"If you can you must have this book near by. It was so horible I did not want to get past Chapter 5 But I suffered through it. The first 2 books were ok but this one you must be a die hard fan to read it, and I mean a real die hard. I really disliked the Sirius Black person. Plus it just was not that exciteing to me at least. But if you are about 10 it might seem a little better. If you want to read a truly good book with wizards in it read J.R.R. Tolken's ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"""
1,rip off of older better books,"check out The Adeventures of Gom, it is just like this, almost identical, these books are total rips off of better books! down with Harry Potter, the twisted little monster!"
1,Definitely not for adults & children over 12 years old.,"Don't be misled by this book being on the Times Best sellers. It should be on a children's best sellers list only. It is extremely childish and unrealistic. To compare this author with Tolkien, Louis Carroll, or any other author of that caliber is a travesty."
1,"WARNING, WARNING, WARNING !","I don't know if any adults come by to this kid's kingdom where 5 stars abound but if some do, be WARNED!This book is an absolute litterary trash.Well, let's relativize - it's good reading for kids - fast action, black and white 2 dimensional characters, VERY simple style.I have read the first 3 books only to see what all this hype was about.The first one got me puzzled: ""Can it really be so primitive?""The second one confirmed:""Yes, it is.""And the third got me laughing aloud.All are worth 1 star and it makes no sense to read more of the same.I won't bother to review all 3, it is the same trash.Now those who would like to read some really good fantasy and eventually to see the difference between Harry Potter and fantasy litterature I would suggest to have a look at:S.DonaldsonG.R.R.MartinS.EriksonT.Williams (the Dragonbone Chair)Then you can go farther and will never return to Harry Potter anymore."
4,It was a great book,This summer i read the book Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban. I thought the book was greta and so was the movie. In the book there is some parts that are the same in the movie and somethings that are in the book not in the movie.That is what i did not like about the book the parts should of been explain so you could understand it more. Overall i like reading Harry Potter books because they are very interesting and exciting to me.
5,Oh now it's getting good!!,"I loved this book when it came out, and read it voraciously probably in 48 hours or so. There are great plot points, and what we learn about Voldermort and his crew is nothing short of amazing. Harry grows up a little more, and we realize that for him, there is nothing simple or easy about the people around him. Part of growing up is to start to see the grey area instead of black and white, and for Harry, the world has turned a little grey this year. Fantastic book for young and old alike."
4,I like the book,"I choose to read Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban this summer,as a summer reading book because I thought the movie was good. So , I decided to read the book and see what is different and the same. J.k. Rowling has a great nack for writing children's because i love the books she writes.What I don't like is that the book ends and doesn't say where Harry stays. Does he stay with his godparent or dr does he go back to his uncle & aunts house.Maybe he stays with his godparent or go's to his uncles or he stays in hogwarts. I would like to read the fourth book to find out."
5,Better than the first two!!!!!!,"Exciting, suspenseful, humorous, and well-written. Harry Potter's third year is just as exciting as the first two, if not more so."
3,My review,"I liked this book, but not so much as the other. It had good action, but it did not make as big of impression on me as the other three. I liked the way they used time travel, and the way the characters in the book work together, but it just did not strike me as one of the best. I do recommend this to many people who like fantasy though."
5,Magical World,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is such a great book! I give it 5 stars because I love the adventure, the suspense, the action, the jokes and the mystery. I recommend this book because I love how the characters interact with each other. I also liked the new characters like Sirius Black, Lupin, Pettigrew, Beaky and more."
5,i love harry potter!,"harry potter is just awesome. whoever said these stories are for little kids is totally missing out. i'm a college junior, and i can't wait til the 5th book comes out! the harry potter books are extremely well-written and brings out the kid in all of us. there's also a nostalgic feel to it, as it reminds me of all the roald dahl books i read in grade school. regardless, they just keep getting better and better. can't wait for the movie :)"
5,Best of All! A Thrill!,This book is about Harry Potter and his third year at Hogwarts School for Witches and Wizards. When Harry gets there Sirius Black a known murderer and prisoner at Azkaban held captive for 12 years escapes! Black helped kill Lily and James Potter (Harry's parents) with Lord Voldemort the worlds most dangerous wizard! But when Harry finds out Black is his godfather he starts to think other plans! This is a GREAT book!
5,harry's adventures continue,"in this third installment, harry finds new ways to get into misadventure. the ending is surprising and delightful. i can't wait to read the next book. my daughter loves harry potter and has found somethings in the ""muggle"" world that seem ""just like harry potter"". if you aren't reading this book, you should be."
5,Harry potter (book 3),Best book ever most people should start reading these books. Never made me stop reading. Harry potter and his adventures are amazing!!
5,Great!!,I have seen the movies and my friends have been telling me to read these books for awhile so I finally am and I love them the writing is excellent and I daresay the books are even greater than the movies!! These are a must-read for anyone and everyone
5,4th Time Reading.,"Id recommend this book to anyone!! So much better than the movies. Don't think I'll ever read this book enough, and this was my 4th time since it came out."
5,It's a great book.,"I love this book! I've read all three and they're great, I like Hedwig, and Hermione's cat. I wish Quidich was real. Thanks Mrs. Rowling for writing them."
5,Smoking ! ! !,"Fascinating book that takes you to the land of magic ,that sweeps you of your feet.This is an adveture story like the previous ones. The moment you start reading, you don't know day from night. All you think about is the story ,it stays in your mind even after you've finished reading it."
5,the best,"i love all four (and i'm sure i will love the next three)harry potter series. but the prisoner of azkaban is my favorite. harry finally learn more about his parents in this one, and found out that he have a father in black."
5,Deserves to be this popular,"My grandma gave me a copy of the first Harry Potter book when it first came out, when it wasn't popular. Why did it take three books before people noticed them? Well, better late than never. Maybe I just love the series, but I think this is the best so far, I can't wait for the fourth one.This is one of the three best books I've read this year, the others being ""Bud, Not Buddy"" by Christopher Paul Curtis, and ""Alien in the Mirror"" by Casey Lytle."
5,The Best!!!,"I have read all three books and they're definitely the BEST!!! I have just finished reading the Sorcerer's Stone for the second time, and almost halfway now on Chamber of Secrets. They're so great I have to finished reading it in one day."
5,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"This book is the book that got me back into reading. I have to admit that this book kept me up reading until midnight some nights this summer. Despite it being 425 pages, it keeps you interested and wondering what is going to happen next. This book is a good long book to read on the boring and lagging summer days. Since I broke my arm this summer, this book is the was the only boredom breaker I had. I plan to read book 1 and 2 this summer because of this book."
4,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"This book is better than the first two. Right when Harry gets to school he already has problems: The usual with Draco Malfoy and that there is a man running aroung trying to get into the school to kill Harry. I didn't like the fact that his stepparents take him home after school. The book clearly states that Harry's stepparents hate him and yet he spends the summer with them. The book would be better if he stayed with his friend Ron over the summer. Besides that, the book was great. Although this book is recommended for readers aged 8 to 12, older kids would enjoy reading it too. If you are a teacher of an 8th grade reading class, read this book with them. All the students in my class enjoyed it very much."
5,"Who says this book is for 9-12 year olds? Heck, I'm 28!",This is a book for everyone! What a great story teller. There's a little Harry Potter in all of us!
3,"Okay, but only partially satisfying","The third book in the Harry Potter series does start out with some foreboding and quickly builds tension. The book starts out well with the escape of Sirius Black from Azkaban, and quickly builds that overall plot over the third year at Hogwarts.While the main premise of the book does continue throughout most of the book, it seemed after completing it that it was a plotline that could have been wrapped up in half of a book. There are revelations toward the end of the book that definitely build suspense for future volumes. However, the end was unfulfilling because it seemed like there should have been more developments out of one volume. Nevertheless, this was enjoyable."
4,Prisoner Of Azkaban,"The magical world is on edge. A known murderer is on the loose and is after the ""boy who lived.""Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is the third book in one of modern literature's most successful series. It is also the only book in the series to not feature Lord Voldemort as it's predominate antagonist. Despite this, the story's significance in the series is that it establishes a bit of protagonist's family history and Harry's need to know more about his own origin."
5,Harry Potter book 3,Good book great price. Very good story. This book tells more of what happened to harry's parents and how they died. And who betrayed who against You-know-who.
4,Much better than the 2nd,This has been the best one (compared to the 1st & 2nd) so far. I liked how there were a few different plots & stories going on at the same time.
5,Harry potter and the prison of Azkaban,I love it so much but it is only my 5 favorite books ever love it so much love it
5,Three time's a charm! - Part 2,"I just thought of some extra points to add. This is my second review . . . I read Book 3 twice in one day, consistently laughing and crying. In reading the 682 reviews of the previous HP books, my heart nearly burst - any book that so inspires us ""muggles"" is undoubtedly some sort of miracle. J.K. Rowling's writing makes me proud to be a human (even if I am of non-magic variation)-The somewhat obsessive 15-year old fan"
5,"Wow, this is a great book.","I loved all of the Harry Potter books. This one did not disapoint me. It is a bit more intricate than the other two books and a bit more fun to read. Harry Potter is not just for kids, all should feel comfortable reading it."
5,Another GREAT story!,"Just like the first two books, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is another wonderfully told story. If I dind't have to go to classes and do homework (I'm a college student) I would have finished it in one day. The story telling is wonderful, the imagry is amazing. Rowling makes you feel like you are running along with Harry and Hermione underneath Harry's invisibility cloak. Right from the beginning Harry finds himself encountering another adventure. I can't wait for the next book in the series. I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the mean time, Maybe I'll practice my spells. :) Happy reading!"
5,A Suspenceful fantasy book for ALL ages!,"Harry Potter strikes again in his 3rd year ofHogwarts. Everyone goes out of there way to keep Harry safe from theescaped prisoner, Sirius Black, but Harry surprises everyone with courage that can last only so long! A must-read book for everyone!"
5,"As the rest in the series are as well, HIGHLY ADDICTIVE","I've always been a book fanatic, but even I was completely broadsided by this series. As a junior in high school, I had also thought them below my level. However, all that changed when I miraculously saw all three at one time in my library, and I thought, ""what the heck, I'll try them."" 48 hours later, I am very tired, very behind in homework, and EXTREMELY addicted to that curious skinny boy named Harry Potter. In my opinion this one is the best one yet; the focus on exciting, twisting plot and the surprisingly bittersweet ending makes this not just a run-of-the-mill children's book where everybody that's good wins and everybody that's evil loses. Instead, there is an awful lot of grey area. I like that, it shows maturity as a writer. and while the books aren't particularly challenging, they are more addictive than any other book I have ever read. And that says a lot."
5,Best book I ever read!,"My mother read this book to me. I am eight years old. I love it and I never thought of story happening in this book. But, the author did it. Wow! J.K. Rowling is very creative author. This book is not scary one to me. but, my mother has read the 4th book - Goblet of Fire. She said the last parts of book were most scary ones. I can read the 2nd book -the Chamber of Secrets by myself. In 3rd book, I never thought that Peter was Ron's pet rat. This book was full of surprises. I hope that the 4th book will not scare me. I hope that you will read Harry Potter book series."
5,A Wonderful Turn of Events,"Many surprises are to be had in book 3 of the Harry Potter series. This installment is slightly different from the other two because the plot takes a huge turn. Harry and his friends are faced with more mysterious dealings at Hogwarts and the threat of an escaped convict, Sirius Black who is considered the most dangerous man in both the muggle and wizzard world. Throughout the year, Harry is faced with the fact that someone again wants him dead. The Durselys are still horrible and the Weasleys are still wonderful. If you weren't hooked before, you will be once you are done with this book!"
3,Harry Potter doesn't make you think,"When I was read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone a few years ago I was amazed. It is really a great book, but there are better fantasy books out there. The strength of this book, as with all Harry Potter books, is plot and characterization. This book is a new brand of fantasy. It is like any other modern tale, but with fantasy mixed in. I used to really like these books, as a matter of fact. But then each book got darker and darker. The whole idea of Harry Potter is magical and popular, but these books won't last forever as classics like The Lord of the Rings. I suggest you try some classic fantasy instead. The latter part of this series of books is now influenced, whether J.K. Rowling likes it or not, by her own popularity."
5,The Wonder Continues,"J.K. Rowling reaches new heights in her third novel, The Prisoner Of Azakban. As I poured through this incredible tale of mystery and mayhem I wondered how Rowling could again exceed my expectations. The third book in the Harry Potter saga twists and turns through an amazing year at Hogwarts with greater energy than ever before. Rowling weaves fantasy and suspense together with amazing creativity, leaving you restless and still reading into the wee hours of the morning. As a teacher, I find all the Harry Potter books excellent tools for teaching prediction strategies. The manner in which Rowling peels away layers of story detail naturally invites students to imagine various turns in the plot. Harry Potter has done wonders for recreational reading among children. I recommend it to anyone, children and adults alike."
5,Try the tapes!,"Not much to add to all the comments about the book, so I'll comment on the reading. Listening to these tapes is pure... well, magic! The only thing was that I thought the name was ""Serious Black"", and waited for an explanation as to why he was Serious. The English accent of the reader just adds to the fun. When I finished this 3rd set of tapes, I quickly signed on to Amazon to see if the 4th was available. I about cried when I saw it was not until JULY! I discovered these books late, so had the great fun of listening to them one after the other.I'm 50 years old, but that made no difference. Amazon should take the 9-12 age bracket off these books. That's what kept me from reading them for so long."
3,Best Book Ever!,Harry Potter is an unusal boy. He is a wizard! While Harry is in Azkaban he goes to Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardy. While Harry is there he must confront the devious man responisble for his parents death. While Harry is there he also meets alot of friends and he finds out why he is there. I thought this book was very good. Although it did have some words and situations that I didn't understand. I have to go out and buy the next issues! You will not be bored by this book!
3,harry potter,harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban is a pretty good book i would say out of the other 5 books. this one is probably my second favorite. the sixth one was probably my favorite. and it made me not want to wait for the seventh book to come out but you just have to wait. i liked the third one because she showed you some of harrys past and that was very interesting
3,harrypotter and the prisonor of azkaban,"Harry Potter 3 is a great book. sirius black kills 13 people with 1 curse. harry potter's defeat of voldemort, black wants to kill Harry, but Harry has something to say about that.Black keeps mumbling""he's at hogwarts ,he's at hogwarts.""Harry is not safe at hogwarts.in this review I will tell you about some of the events happening at hogwarts. Harry finds about he's got the grim.the hippogriff named Buckbeak has to be exacuted after it clawed draco malfoy(draco made it mad)trying to get hagrid fired.The dementors are trying to catch black by disturbing almost everyone,shall I go on,harry and hermione go back in time to stop the exacution of buckbeak. read this book,I give it a3 out of 5.this review was written by,TONY ADAMS"
4,Harry Potter,Harry Potter and The Prisoner of AzkabanBy J.K. RowlingIn Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban there is a magical adventure waiting to jump out into your mind and capture you. J.K. Rowling is an extraordinary writer and her books will persuade you to read on and on and on.Like the first two books Harry must learn about wizardry. Although this year there is a catch. Harry has to deal with some pretty weird things.Harry must now face his fears of dementors with the help of Professor Lupin.I think Harry Potter has a stunning edge to pull your soul in and make you just WONDER.Harry and his friend Hermione must help save two lives.Can they fulfill the task? Will they be successful? Read the book to find out.By Kyree
4,Still good...,"After having read Book 1 and 2, I kept on to Book 3, which's certainly better than Book 2. But (this's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars) I enjoyed Book 1 the most so far.In Book 3 the action, which led to the main plot of the story started out much sooner than Book 2. The details seem to be a lot in this book that I got lost some time after putting it down for a day or two. Nevertheless, overall the author's imagination and creativity still abound...as always."
3,"This book is too long, too convoluted and too dour.","The first two ""Harry Potter"" books were splendid. They had heart, warmth and imagination to spare. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" starts out well, but it goes downhill in the second half. Rowling is too busy with a very complicated plot to inject the humor and the warmth into this book that made the first two books so delightful. The book should have been shorter by at least seventy-five pages. It drags in the last quarter and the ending is much too plot-oriented. The whimsical characters of the last book, such as Moaning Myrtle and the house elf who keeps beating himself up (Dobbie, I think his name was), are missing here and there are no new characters in this book to equal them. Rowling had mentioned in an interview that she wanted to explore darker themes in her later books, but I think that she is going too far in that direction."
3,New Harry Potter book disappointing...,"Though I am a avid fan of Harry Potter, I found the latest book disappointing. The plot seems to have lost most of its vibrancy, it's charm,and most important, its wonder. The novelty of a wizard world is wearing off quickly. I was disappointed by the quickie ending that seemed kind of rushed and hurried up. Harry is sinking to the level of his nemesis,Malfoy, by using his Invisibility Cloak to throw mud at him behind his back, and turning his Aunt into a balloon. I only hope the next books improve."
5,Where the series takes off...,"Rowling could have written 6 adventure stories like Chamber of Secrets and people would still have loved Harry Potter. Azkhaban let people know that she had something extra in mind. Harry-Ron-Hermione-Hagrid, Harry-Lupin, Harry-Sirius, Harry-Dumbledore, James-Sirus-Lupin-Pettigrew. The book leaves behind the 'I'm a wizard!' focus of book 1 and the 'life at Hogwarts' focus of book 2, and turns to a real focus on friendship and love. These themes are continued in the later books, of course, though with an added element of death and loss. Here we get just the good stuff. Hard not to like that.Somewhat surprisingly, the movie for book 3 actually improves the experience of reading the book. The time-travel sequence at the end is much better in the movie than in the book and, having seen the movie, the book's missteps can be overlooked."
4,Harry Potter as adult,"If you are a Harry Potter fan, you need to read the book. Is has a bit less adventures, more mind bending stories, but it is a must for Potter fans, it is the last story - Harry becomes an adult."
5,Outstanding,"It's been a very long time since I read a book series this satisfying. I'm not a child or teenager, but the stories captivated me. I can't wait for book 5, myself, and would heartily recommend these books to anyone."
5,Unexpected Delight,"I am well into adulthood and had not bought into all of the Harry Potter hype. I guess I believed the critics who said that these stories were not as good as their marketing. My mother gave me this audio book narrated by Jim Dale and just to give myself a break from public radio, I poped it in while cleaning one night. How shocked I was to find myself totally absorbed in the story. I began to think about the characters throughout the day and wondering what was going to happen next. I was especially impressed with the detail and intricacies of the ending. The suspense almost killed me and the conclusion of this book left me with a desire to read all of the books in the series immediately."
5,Harry Potter books are COOL,"I have only read this book once but, it is so good. The book has a great plot and good size. It's about a 13 year-old boy who lives with his mean Anut and Uncle. He blew up his Anut Marge like a balloon. And somehow got back to Hogworts school. I do not want you to find out no more til you read this book.ENJOY THE BOOK"
4,"Well done Ms. Rowling, well done.","While I'm not sure I'd say this addition to the Potter saga is as good as the first or second book, it has to be close. It is a well written, highly entertaining story with plenty of twists and turns, and I'll be honest, it gripped me enough that I finished it in a single day. Well done Ms. Rowling, well done."
1,I got a different book!,"Apperently the picture of the book is of book #3 while the name is of book #2 of Harry Potter!So, while it is in good condition, it is not what I wanted!"
2,The book was way below average,"I've read some good books(farenheit 451, Pet Cemetary, A tale of two cities), and then there are the bad ones. This was a bad one. The book would have been beter if it was shorter. After 150-200 pages the rest is mind-numming babble. I would recommend this book to anyone under the age of ten who can't grasp the meaning of a good book. This was probably second worst to The Sorcerors Stone(The best being Chamber of Secrets and it still stunk). It is also all about witchcraft which is against my beliefs and better judgement. I wish my judgement was there when i choose to read this mess. I just wanted too see if it was as bad as the others and it was. DO NOT BUY IT! UNLESS YOU ARE A RAVING LUNATIC."
1,All these books are about witch craft.,"I cannot believe that Amazon would sell Mr. Potter's books. All his books are about witch craft and pull children into this cult deeper and deeper with each book. If you don't believe me, take these books to your pastor or priest or rabbi and ask them what they think!"
1,The Awful Harry Potter,"This book is not sutable for children of any age!!!! Harry and his wizard friend go to an amaganary school called Hagwarts. An evil devil type of thing is after Harry Potter. Harry trys to figure out why, He also trys to figure out why the evil thing killed his parents in the first place. I know the reason is because the were doing witch craft and wizardy. But insted they were killed to be killed. Never let your child read this book because if they do they will try to use witch craft an wizardy. They always win, but really they should be killed with the parents. I am very angry at JK Rowling for writing this book because it is not a Christain book. Also I am very discusted by the publishers for publishing this book.sincerly,a strong christianMoses Joans"
4,Better than the second,"A month after finishing the second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I read this book. Again and again, the story really impressed me much. I think the story in this book is better than the two before. The ending is unpredictable and surprising. I saw the movie last year, and it didn't describe the story in detail. If you haven't read this book but have seen the movie, I would recommend you to buy and read this book."
5,I'm Hooked on Harry,"Like many others, I fall out of the targeted age group for the Harry Potter series. The third book in the series is particularly good. I write this reveiw as a college student at the office of the internship I have in NYC. I want to elucidate how impressed I am with Rowler. The third installment is filled with twists and bends that tie in beautifully with the other books in the series. Harry's life seems to be in jeopardy when supposed mad-man Sirius Black escapes from the wizard prison Azkaban and is on the loose. A man hunt ensues led by the wretched Azkaban guards who are ""dementors"" that are able feed off people's happiness and have a kiss worse than death.... Packed with mystery and mystique, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is for any age (as long as the person has the ability to read). It does not matter if you've been following the series or not, the book is great either way."
5,This should be awesome reading.,"After having read many of the reviews, I know my nine year old son, and myself, will love the Harry Potter series, which my sister-in-law has promised to give him as a holiday gift. I have recently started to reread classic and new children's literature, and am excited about the prospect of reading the Harry Potter books."
5,MAGIC!,"I loved the story Harry Potter one and two, but the third wasawesome. If you love to read you will love this book. I reallydidn't like witchcraft and wizardry, but when my family read it and told me to, I was a little hesitant. But once I had read the first one, I had to read the rest. It was a little challenging beause I was only 10 but that didn't stop me and now I cant wait for the fourth one to arrive in the U.S."
5,Be For Edge-of-Your-Seat Action,"J. K. Rowling has written another spellbinding book to add to the two she has already written. This book has many plot twists and turns, and I guarantee, the ending will knock your socks off!"
5,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"J. K. Rowling truly captures your mind and sparks your imagination in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I really enjoyed this book because she takes you on a wonderful adventure with excitement, courage, and three fantastic main characters. You enter the world of witchcraft and suddenly are captured in it. You get so involved with this story that you just want to devour it whole. Although this story is fiction, you can still relate it to your life because of friendship and courage that stand out in this book and make it bold. The story takes place at Hoggwarts, where Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger try to capture a escaped prisoner, save a large creature named Buckbeak, win the House Cup, find Ron's rat who mysteriously disappeared, and still study to pass final exams. From the very first page to the last word I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense, drama, or mystery."
5,"Almost as good as the first, MUCH better than the second!","After I read _Chamber of Secrets_ I was reluctant to spend the money on a Harry Potter hardcover again. _Prizoner of Azkaban_ is MUCH better, and lives up to the precedent of humor, imagination, and intrigue that was set by Rowling in _Sorcerer's (Philosopher's) Stone_. I was REALLY happy that this book revived the wonderful feeling I'd had in reading the first book! However, I would recommend this series now to young adults and adults instead of children since, at 300+ pages, the length might be overwhelming for the average child reader. Unfortunately, I've heard there's a live-action movie of the first two books in the works and that the series will be getting darker as it goes on, so enjoy the wonder of _Sorcerer's (Philosopher's) Stone_ and _Prisoner of Azkaban_ for the joy it brings now!"
5,HARRY POTTER IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!,"WOW! This book is WAY awesome, almost better than the first two!!!!! This book is so NOT only for ""ages 9-12"" Me and my friends are going to collect every single book and we are obsessed with them!"
5,"Well done again, Rowling","Ah Harry, what is there left to say that hasn't already been said by a zillion other people? Nothing! I loved this book and am 2/3rds of the way through the next book in the series (I couldn't be bothered to stop reading and write a review). Excellent book in the series!"
5,Unfornately that I'm not allowed to give more than 5 stars!!,"I found HP & the Prisoner of Azkaban the best among the other books of the series. The 4th.books, HP & the Globet of Fire, is very good, but it leads the readers to the 5th. book which is not available yet, ig8and I HATE TO WAIT! Some say HP is too simple when compared to JRR Tokein's creations. However I really prefer HP rather than JRR Tokein's (The Hobbit & Lord of the Rings I) coz. I found JRR Tokein's book a little too ""dark"". After all, the two books are different. So if you have read JRR Tokein's book don't try to compare JK Rowling's HP series against JRR Tokein's. Then you will appreciate the simplicity the Harry Potter series offered."
4,J.k Rowling strikes again,This book is really action packed and tells a bit more about Harry's history. A must read for Harry potter fans.
5,J.K. ROWLING HAS DONE IT AGAIN !,J.K Rowling is my favorite author. Once I got interested in the book I couldn't stop reading it. I felt like I was right there having an icy chill run through me from the Dementors or feeling the soft feathers of my owl.
5,Awesome Book!,"This book is incredible, if you havn't read it, you must! The suspense just makes you keep reading, and the ending is full of twists! In my opinion, this is the best Harry Potter book. I can't wait for the 4th!!"
5,I love this book so much I can read it a hundred times!!!!,"It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and things just seem to get even worse for him since the escape of Sirius Black... who wizard and witches claim, Voldemorts follower. First... he sees a dementor on the Hogwarts Express and gets knocked out uncontious... then as the year passes by... there are terrified complaints saying that Sirius Black broke in the Gryffindor tower- where Harry's dormitory is located. Harry doesn't seem to worry about that as much- it was his fight for his life against the dementors. As you read this book... you will get into it like I did! i had already read all three of the Harry Potter books in the series so far, and I am ready for the fourth...if there'll be any. I strongly recommend this book to every one- who likes books about adventure, wicthcraft, wizardry, comedy, and a bit of scariness. So before you read it... prepare for adventure and imagination!¡!"
5,A fabulous story for a person of any age!,"I'm 14, and I'm not ashamed to say that I read this book, as well as the other two in the series. I think ""Harry Potter"" is great for any reader, be it a young child or a parent. As it is, my 12 year old brother and 43 year old mother are also enchanted by the stories. They draw you in with Harry's tales of adventure, and they're so funny, especially Dobby in the second story. Beware, though: once you've started reading Harry Potter, you're hooked and you wait on pins and needles until the next book arrives in stores."
5,These books are the BEST!,"I read this book over the summer right before school started and I loved it. Now that school has started I have seen at least 10 people reading these great books. I know that doesn't seem to be a big thing but to see alot of 8th graders reading these books is cool I think. I don't think there should be an age limit for these books, my mother read the first one and now she loves it! We both like Hermione most out of all the charaters! Everyone should read these books. You'll be missing out if you don't."
5,The best audio CD's I've ever heard,"I listen to lots of books on tape, and Jim Dale's readings of the four Harry Potter books are the best I've ever heard. A lot of people, including me, are very fond of Rob Inglis's readings of the Lord of the Ring books, but these are even better. Jim Dale does a slew of wonderful voices, and I think his Hagrid and Professor McGonagall in particular are even better than in the movie. Although audio CD's certainly aren't cheap, I think you will find that these can be listened to over and over again with great enjoyment."
4,Action packed!!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J.K. Rowling is a very action filled book. Like all other Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling, you get left in suspense throughout the whole book until the very end. For example, in the beginning they tell you about this very mean and troubled prisoner, named Sirius Black that escaped from a prison called Azkaban, but later on in the book (...) . I had no problems reading this book and infact I wouldn't mind reading it again."
5,Harry Potter: one way trip to wonderland,"Young Hrry Potter enriches the mind with adventure, life, and an imagination that Rowling deeply expresses."
5,A Great Book,"This is one of the best books i have ever read. I liked everything about it, especially the ending, but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it! Read this book. Anyone can like it, even if you're an adult. I've read the Harry Potter books tons of times and I'm still not tired of them."
4,Neal's Review,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great book for all ages. It has a bit of fantasy and suspense. Harry gets himself into big trouble in this book, plus there is a surprising twist at the end of the book. The best book in the series yet. Something big is going to happen at Hogwartz. Harry's big problem at Hogwartz are Dementors. They're there to capture a prison escapist. An armed and dangerous madman. The madman killed before and now he is after Harry!! Harry has some good friends but he also has some powerful enemies. This book ties up loose ends from the other books plus it leaves you with many questions. I cant even wait for the next one to come out! If you like all of the previous Harry Potter books this books is for you!!"
5,The best yet,"This Harry Potter book is the best so far (yes, including book 4). It's just so sad and suspensful and funny all in one wonderful book. And I do mean it is better than 4!"
5,WOW!! The best one yet,"I cannot believe that J.K.Rowling has produced another astounding book!! Usually as series get bigger the quality of the books deteriorate, but not so in this case!In this 3rd HP book, Harry is whisked off into another exciting year at Hogwarts. There are new characters and old, things that are the same and things that are different. Follow Harry through his roller-coaster ride of a year that ends with a great surprise and an interesting twist, and you will be begging for the next book!!"
4,Review,"Fast service, but the book is a little old...still enjoyed it tho and no pages missing!! Thank you!"
4,Oh Harry ! your not the hero this time,"Just could not take my eyes out off this book. In this book Harry is not the hero. He is more passive than usual, but to find out the background of his father and his friends and why prof snape hates him was refreshing."
5,Who is Scabbers?,"Rowling amazes us again. I think I read this book in one day. I couldn't put it down. The true (! ) identity of Scabbers is shocking, amazing, and incredible. Obviously if you've made it this far in the Harry Potter series, you shouldn't stop here!"
5,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban takes place in all parts of England.The book's three main characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger like to think of themselves as parnormal detectives. They investigate things that others are too scared to. But this time, they may put their lives on the line for the last time when they meet the escaped prisoner of Azkaban. He is believed to be a ruthless, murderous, trader of a man, Sirius Black is back after 13 years of entrapment. What are his motives, is he back to finish what his ""master"" Lord Voldemort started? Or is it something else, something bigger?This book shows how a single betrayal tore apart one family and sent a little boy off to thirteen years of unhappiness. I definately recommend this book to anyone who wants excitement on every page and to anyone who who believes in a would-be happy ending to an unhappy begining."
5,Another Excellent Book,"Well, what can I say? The number of stars says it all. Rowling's books are spectular and full of new, imaginative thoughts, stories, and characters. I thought that after two excellent books that Rowling wouldn't be able to produce another of the same calabre, but she did, and in flying colors too. Harry's life just seems to get more and more exciting and just when you think you've read everything, you have to think again. Another excellent book by my now favourite writer."
5,"Anthony Michaels review for ""Harry Potter - Book 3""","AGAIN, J.K. Rowling had managed to bring joy to faces of both kids and adults all over the country. With ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"", she introduced the main CHARACTERS of the series. In ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", she went to a darker and more SINISTER plot - with great new characters. Now, with ""Harry Potter and the Prisonar of Azkaban"", she has once again, spread both TERROR and magic throughout the entire world. This book, as good as any of the others, is worth your time. In fact, grab the book and start reading right now (unless your in the middle of another). If you don't have one, GET one! This book is the third installment to the MAGIC OF HARRY POTTER!ALSO BY J.K. ROWLINGHarry Potter and the Sorceror's StoneHarry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"
4,Another Book,"The third novel of Harry's series there was way different than the first two. There was no Voldemort for Harry to face and there was more excitement and more adventures in the book. I would say that this book was way better than the second. It has shown how Harry has changed and now has the courage to confront his uncle. This particular book shows us a lot problems that actual teens go through. Of all three books so far this one is the best. It has a lot of sympathy. It shows when friends fight with each other or have an arguement and then make up; like Ron and Hermione. People loose someone they love: Harry, Ron, and Hermione thought htey had lost Buckbeak forever. oK. The movie was good but, not that much information was shown. A lot of the details were missing and important ones too. overall both third book and movie were good. So I'm not telling you read the book nor am I telling you not to either. Just that it was a good book."
2,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book review,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a boring sequelof the Harry Potter series. There were a lot of mystery's that were all mostly at the end of the book, The story line also was not as good as i heard it was. I for one enjoyed the short read but it was not as exiting as the Harry Potter books before it."
2,I didn't like this book,"Just kidding! I loved it. Though I do agree the series is getting darker, they are still very good books. I will not tell you the plot since it would spoil the fun. I think the people who gave it only a few stars and think its going to make us kids go out and kill someone, get real! Watch the news.Read the bible. These have more violence then all the Harry Potter books put together! This book should have a million stars!"
4,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner is the best book Ive ever read!I would say it is the best book yet of all 5! For it to make more since I would read all the books in order.So join Harry,Ron,and Hermiony as they go aboard the Howarts Express for their 3rd year back at Hogwarts!"
5,So Emerald,Best book yet. Super. Any ather word for Amazingly Super Duper Mega Great. I don't think so. A book so great a word coudn't fit.
5,buy it now!,"i have read all the books in the series so far and i must saythis is the best! it is so addicting i never wanted to put itdown. the suspense, adventure, humor, and modern fairy tale type ofwriting made me finish this book in one day. there is no questioning me, buy this book NOW!"
3,Not the best,"Although this does keep you up late into the night and you can't put it down, it doese have some drawbacks. The plot is pretty predictable. I knew that Harry would save the day and be the hero. It is the same for the last two books. There is some form of dark magic going on at Hogwarts, and Harry comes along saves the day. I wish that it would have some unpredictable twist at the end, like for once he isn't succesful. My choice between Harry Potter or a good old classic like Tom Sayer, I would go with the classic. The thing that aggrivates me the most though is the fact that I haven't found anyone else who challenges this series. People just assume that if its Hary Potter, its one the best books of all time"
3,Interesting,"A great book as a gift for someone 3-300. An easy reading book that is meant for all ages. Even though this was my first time reading a book in the series, it was easy to understand."
3,A Good book.,"The plot in Harry Potter book 3 developed not as exciting as I had hoped. The book is a good book, the writing simple but gripping, but it did't turn out to be as exciting as I hoped. I would definately not rate it 5 stars, but still the book is good, and clever. A reasonable read."
3,harrypotter and the prisonor of azkaban,"Harry Potter 3 is a great book. sirius black kills 13 people with 1 curse. harry potter's defeat of voldemort, black wants to kill Harry, but Harry has something to say about that.Black keeps mumbling""he's at hogwarts ,he's at hogwarts.""Harry is not safe hogwarts.in this review I will tell you about some of the events happening at hogwarts. Harry finds about he's got the grim.the hippogriff named Buckbeak has to be exacuted after it clawed draco malfoy(draco made it mad)trying to get hagrid fired.The dementors are trying to catch black by disturbing almost everyone,shall I go on,harry and hermione go back in time to stop the exacution of buckbeak. read this book,I give it a3 out of 5.this review was written by,TONY ADAMS"
5,Harry Potter and the Prisner of Azkaban,"I loved Harry Potter #3 .It is the greatest book , out of 5stars it gets 7. J.K. Rowling once again does an outstanding job withthe details and colerful pictures that come to mind as you read.Allthe characters have an amazing but yet believable personality .All of the wizard things are great like moving pictures, Owls that carry your mail ,Unicorns, broom sticks,and a secret magical town hidden under a pub in England . Those are some of the things that you will encounter while reading this book . I recommend this book for ages over seven. This book is the best book I have ever read !"
5,The Best Harry Potter Book,I think Harry Potter is really good because it is filled with adventure and Draco Malfoy is rude. I think Harry Potter is the best book I've ever read. This book is full of surprises. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
5,the best of the seires yet,"I think that this is the best of th seires yet. It is about a prisoner (Black) that breaks out of a wizard jail called Azkaban. All throughout the book he trys to catch Harry, then finally he catchs him by catching Ron. I'm not going to give the ending away because it was a surprise for me and it'll be a surprise for you. I guarantee you once you start this book you won't be able to put it down"
5,This is a great book!!!,"This is the best searies rthat you can read! It is very descriptive and you feel like you are right there. You never want to put the book down, you just want to see what Harry Potter and his friends do next, wether it be under the invisablity clock, in Hogsmed, or finding the truth and saving two people. He is the best!"
5,The greatest book I've ever read,I am from Switzerland and and this was my first book that I read in english and I loved it.I could read it again and again ! It reeched the end of my imaginations. Well I think that the Harry Potter are the best books anyone could write!
5,The Best Yet,"This is a wonderfully woven tale continuing the story of Harry Potter and his friends. It is more fanciful, more mysterious, and even more creative than the first two -- which I enjoyed immensely. But this one is the best yet. I can't wait for Rowlings fourth. The threads all come together to give the reader hope even in the worst of times. The mystery pieces all come together in a tale of darkness, magical creatures, and loveable characters. You'll love it."
5,An Imaginative Fantasy for All Ages.,"At 24, I tend to read books by Dean Koontz, Sue Grafton, Michael Crichton, and other ""adult"" fiction novelists.However, reading the Harry Potter books has brought out the child in me and I am completely fascinated and drawn in to the magical world and characters created by J.K. Rowling. Ms. Rowling has captivated my attention as much if not more than any other author I have read.This third book is the most intricate of the three books so far and is proof that this series is only getting better. While I will agree that some of the material may not sit well with easily frightened children, I highly recommend this book for people of all ages."
5,U.S. Edition is best!,"Potter is priceless for kids of all ages, and I'm 66! Be sure to buy the U.S. edition, as it is by far a much better quality. Better design, paper, typestyle----everything, but even the Limey edition is grrrreat! Don't panic.....I'm English."
5,Utterly Amazing for kids and adults of all ages!,"Granted I didn't jump on the Harry Potter bandwagon until around 6 months ago. I ADORE this series, and I will admit I am not in the intended age range here.I am 26 years of age, but I can't wait to get to the next book. I think these books are the most imaginative I have read since the Narnia Chronicles when I was young. For a year or so, I thought these were just for kids. Yet one day I took the plunge, and now I will not turn back until I have read all the forthcoming Harry Potter books. I recommend it to everyone, young and old alike!"
5,Harry Rules B-A-B-Y !,"Harry Potter books I'll have to say are the best books I ever read! He rules! It is so much fun to read his books! Oh and if there is anybody who says his books teach Witchcraft, OH BULL HONKEY! His books are just wonderfull fiction stories! Thanks J.K.! Take my advice, READ Harry Potter NOW!"
5,all harry potter books,"My10 year old loves his books , and has stayed up very late at night to finish one of them, but of course not with my permission. But I cannot complain she is a straight A student, and I understand her love of books , because I am the same way . I have always believed that if a child is a good reader he or she will excel in everything else . Also she loves R.L Stein books also."
3,"A bit of a stumble, but a worthwhile read","""Chamber of Secrets"" is one of my favorite books of all time, and I also loved ""Sorcerer's Stone"", but in the third book of the Harry Potter series Rowling doesn't dazzle as much as her first two books did. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book - and definitely worth reading - but it loses something. How many times is Harry Potter going to sneak out of the dormitory/school and not get expelled? It seems like he is constantly letting Gryffindor down only to triumph in the end. I hope that book 4 revitalizes the series, because I would hate to see such a wonderful thing get bogged down in formula and cliche. And I didn't really like the ending. It's a bit confusing and seems to be trying too hard. But the very end comes back a bit and leaves you with a satisfied feeling - so all we have to do now is wait impatiently for book 4."
5,!~*AwEsOmE bOoK*~!,WOW is all that i have to say about this book! the one~star readers must not have payed attention or something!! JK Rowling did an awesome job on this!! It kept me in suspense the whole time!!!
5,The Harry Potter Series,"I think the Harry Potter books were one of the best books i ever read. Harry Potter is a book inwitch i most recamend. It is full of Adventuresis places. What i liked about the book was it was different from most books it was very fictional , yet very interesting. You can go to your local bookstore and buy it or have it shipped from Amazon.com. If you are very outgoing and aventures you will love this book as much as i did."
5,Apprehensive was used too much,This book was very good and an enjoyable read but I couldn't help but be annoyed by the fact that the word apprehensive was used constatly. J.K. Rowling is a very talented author but I can't understand why she didn't use other words besides aprehensive. This book is still very exciting and full of adventures twists that will have readers of any age turning the pages.
5,SO COOL!!!!!,"I love all of the Harry Potter books, and this one was no exception. It seems to me that they just get better and better. The way that J. K. Rolling tells the story is outrages, and how she tricks you into thinking that it was one person, but it is someone completly different! If i could, i would give this a 100 star rateing! It's a great book and a great series. READ IT!!!!"
5,Definitely the best of the first three!Unpredictable!,"I loved the first two books and could not believe the extra excitement, twists, and ""cool"" things that came about in this one. Yes, in all the Potter books, you can predict that Harry will be involved in solving something. But, this one was truly twisted and nail biting. It did get a bit confusing during the heated moment on who said and did what to whom, but just read those few pages twice and it works. These books are not just for kids...I am 30 something with a very hectic schedule and I cannot put them down! Good entertainment. I'd rather read Potter in my few minutes to spare than watch TV."
5,the best book of the series,This is the best book I ever read. Right from the beggining I couldn't put the book down!! It was wierd when it said that Lord Voldemort wasn't the villian.When Harry's broom was destroyed I thought that was it for his carrier. But of course he comes back proud with the Firebolt!!! At the end when they went back in the past with Hermione's necklace was the most exciting part of the book in my opinion. They went back into the past because Harry found out that Sirius (the villian supposebly) is Harry's uncle! They also went back in time to free Sirius because he was going to be killed. I loved this book so much that when I'm done with the series I will deffidently come back and read this book again. Anybody who is reading the Harry Potter books that hasn't read the third book yet will love it.
4,Robert Wesley's book reveiw,"This book was alright but not the best, it was exciteing and sometimes funny because his aunt talks about his mom. I liked how they put new people in the book that were very interesting. I think peole well like this book because of the adventure and excitment."
4,The third year at Hogwarts,"J.K.Rowling writes another fantastic fantacy novel called Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Kids nine and up should be able to read this book.Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger return to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry for their third year of magical sudies, but this year has a twist. The Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is a werewolf! On top of that Harry's own godfather is suspected of trying to murder him , and Harry gets the newest racing broom. This year is going to be a little over the edge.This is my favorite Harry Potter book, It is very exciting. Clearly one of the best Harry Potter books J.K.Rowling has ever written."
1,Don't get the (Pb) if you like good quality books EDITION REVIEW,"I was not fond of this edition (binding and paper) in fact we are returning it and buying the better quality. I don""t know what (Pb) means when you order something but in this case it means small print and low quality paper. It's the brown stuff that feels like what brown thin brown newsprint."
4,This time a little more intense,With book three the series takes a dark turn. As harry is fearing for his life he must watch himself as escaped prisoner Sirius Black is after him. but no one know why.The dementors that were assigned to protect harry creep him out and he is the only one who is. With more intense themes this book satisfies the older of us.
5,Not Just 4 Kids...Everyone,"Do you like adventurous, exciting, magical, science fiction, mysterious, and suspense filled books? Then you'll love Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. If you don't have much imagination and don't like not being able to put a book down until your done with a part, then I wouldn't recommend this book. One part in the book I like is when Harry finds out who S. Black is really. Another part I like is the Shrieking House and its secrets. I recommend this book to people of all ages. Just read the first couple chapters and you'll fall in love."
5,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Harry Potter is my faviorte series of books but this one is my faveriot I like how the story twist and turns.
5,I Love Harry Potter,I'm 12 years old and hated reading until the Harry Potter series came out. I couldn't put them down. These books are so exciting. Something thrilling happens on every page!
5,harry potter and the prisonor of Azkaban,Harry Potter and the prisonor of Azkzban was an imaginative fun and interesting .I thought the surpise ending was one of the best parts of the book. This is one of the best books I have ever read it deserves 6 stars but that wasn't one of the choices!
5,I couldn't put it down,"This book was one of the best books along with the other two books in the collection. Before I read these books I hadn't read a book from cover to cover in a long time. You should buy this and give it to your children because this book is so good that when you start to read it you want to know how it ends, and before you know it the book is finished and you want to learn more about the strange boy with the scar on his forhead. And as for those people who think that the books are getting darker and unsutible for small children, they are wrong there is nothing bad about these books. You could find more wrong in your childs cartoons than in these great books. I am looking forward to reading the next book."
4,the worst of the bunch,Don't let my title deceive you. This is still a great book but in comparison to the others it was a slight stepback. The book is still very entertaining and a necessity for the progression of the story. I just wasn't sucked in as fast or left wanting more as i was with the first 2 and with book 4 (sorry haven't finished the series just yet). I've been told by a few others that have finished the series that this is the worst and if thats the case then it should speak volumes of how well the rest of the books are.
4,herry potter,The book Herry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a grate book. its about the famous Herry Potter and a man man that was blamed for killing herry's parents. but finally the truth comes out is Sirius Black herry's parents real killers?You'll have to read the book to find out.I would reccomend this book to young adults because it is a good book.
4,lightningbolt guy,Harry has to stay with his mean aunt and uncle over the summer. They treated him like an outkast. He had a small room in the basement where only him and his owl where. One night Harry's owl came to his rooms with a message. it was saying happy birthday. It was from one of his close frends at hog warts. The owl brought a nother message saying to come to hog wartts. All of a sudden a bus came to pick him up.
5,They keep getting better....,"The third novel in the Harry Potter series might be the best yet. It and Chamber of Secrets are very close. The Prisoner of Azkaban presents what is probably the most convoluted, complicated story yet in the series. What seems like a simple plot for the first 350 pages, turns into a chaotic series of revelations for the last 100 pages. Sirius Black is an amazing character, and I hope he is explored more in future novels. Also, I felt like the character development went a whole lot farther in this novel, with Ron and Hermione both really being explored by Rowling. Before, they were just Harry's sidekicks, but this book gives them their own perspective on the events, and they both provide key aspects to the way the story unfolds.The weird thing is, that I've heard that Goblet of Fire is when the books get ""crazy."" If this one wasn't crazy, then I have no idea what to expect from the next books."
5,Best one so far....,The Prisoner of Azkaban was full of action and magic. Unexpected twists and turns. I could not stop reading it. I sat down to read a couple of chapters this morning and just finished it tonight. I loved the ending! I recommend this book to anyone. Harry discovers the truth about the servant of Voldemort and the truth about Sirus Black. As Harry is getting older he is starting to face things that scare even the reader!! Spectacular!!!
3,"Not great Literature, but fun and easy","This is a good book. Just because it doesn't convey any really profound ideas doesn't mean it's not fun to read. Some people also seem to think that Diana Wynne Jones has been stolen from. Her books have similar subject matter, but her books don't have the charm and humor that these books do. Also, if you think that these books will make your children start studying the occult, you are just a touch off your rocker."
3,Interesting to borrow from a friend or library..............,"It's the best of the first 4 HP books published so far, but JK Rowling's imagination is frankly, not very good. She relies on magic wands and the kids' classes too much to bring here book 'to life'. Characters are awfully shallow. Only the final few pages are worth reading. If you expect adventure, mystery and intrigue, look elsewhere (many other authors are writing fantasy series worthy of being read by a wider audience). If you're expecting broomsticks and magic wands, buy this book... and consider yourself deprived of the magical fantasy worlds created by more able authors. I'm not talking Tolkien here - his descriptions tax the nerves of the hardest readers. There are too many, find out for yourself in the fantasy section of amazon.com. I can't bother to list them here."
3,This book was o.k.,You should read this bookIt's fantastic. This book isBy J.K.Rowling.This is fiction.The main character is Harry.Harry lives with the Muggles.They hate wizards. Harry runs away to Howartz because he doesn't like them.They believe a guy is after himto kill him. The guy works for aman named Voldemort. Harrycan't go outside because Serious Black is loose .Harry faints in a train .His parent were killed. He plays quiddich.Has a scar in his forehead.Harry parent were Black friends. He's broom get destroy in a bad weather. HE can hear his parent talking when they were killed. that only happens when he sees aDementors. He's parent name were James and lily potter. They give him a map secretPassages to get to Hogmeade. He is the best seeker on Gryffindor. Has the fastest broom that somebody gave it to him. It's faster than any broom and cost a' lot. Everybody want a ride on it.
1,Potterstore? Really,It is inconvenient and ridiculous that we have to go another site and create a new login to buy this book for the kindle. Amazon should not even list.
5,Another Magical Experience,"I read the first two Harry Potter books a year or so ago. I figured it was time to get on the ""Hogwarts Train"" again (so-to-speak). It was just as wonderful as the last two books. I was especially thrilled by Professor Dumbledore's advice to Harry Potter toward the end of the book: ""You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you...and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him."" I LOVE IT. The last few chapters in this particular book will really keep one ""gripped"".I'll have to read the next two books--in due time. Smiles :)"
4,It is very funny !!! great book!!!,"This is a plot for everyone because it is very entertaining. It is also very easy to understand. Once you start reading, you can hardly put the book down. There are also links to other episodes of the book that makes the reader want to read more. There are usages of magic, fantasy creatures, and competitive sports in the plot to create colorful variety to the audience. J.K. Rowling uses the purity of adolescence and interprets it in the form of courage, cooperation, and youthful innocence that showed the power to overcome many things.Overall, this is a very attention-grabbing and impressive book. It also leaves good messages to the reader."
1,This book was okay.,"ACTUALLY THIS BOOK WAS GREAT, I ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR SO YOU WOULD READ IT. tHE PLOT WAS EXCELLANT, HOWEVER i WISH A CHARACTER LIKE pROFESSOR lUPIN OR sIRIUS bLACK REMAINED. ALSO I THOUGHT THE VULNERABLE hARRY pOTTER THEME DUIRING THE qUIDITCH MATCH WAS POINTLESS. iT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER IF HE HAD LOST A MATCH DO TO HIS OWN FAULT, NOT THE dEMENTORS. lASLY i THINKA NEW CHARACTER SHOULD BE ADDED, CALL ME A ROMANTIC BUT SOMEONE WHO HAS A CRUSH ON hERMIONE, AND SOMETHING LIKE A DANCE, WOULD BE PERFECT FOR ONE OF THE MANY hOGWARTS SOCIAL EVENTS. i MEAN wITCHES AND wIZARDS HAVE EMOTIOND TOO RRIGHT?"
1,Joseph from Richview Middle School,This IS the third Harry Potter Book and the movie will be out soon. It begin during summer vaction. I did not like it was to long.
1,Why is there reference to demonic acts in a book for kids?,"My son enjoyed reading the first two books by JK Rowling. Unfortunately, he was not able to finish reading the third book after I read the chapter that dealt with reading tea leaves. The mention that only ""special"" people could interpret the information was way too close to demonic behavior for me. Isn't there someone who can right interesting stories without delving into demonic acts and the occult?"
1,You'd have to lock me up,"That's the only way you would get me to read the whole of this book.Honestly !There was a man - a real grown up adult man reading this book on the tube this morning. As brazen as you like - no shame whatsoever. As bold as brass - reading his little heart out. He believed that what he was doing was acceptable and normal.IT'S NOT.Has the whole world gone mad?For Gawd's sake ! This is a baby book - a tale of wizards with beards, black macs and dodgy 1960 winkle picker boots.Wake up - snap my fingers and you will awake from the heavy hypnotic state that has ensnared you. One - Two - Three - and awake.Awaken from your stupor and realise thatIT'S ALL GUFF"
4,My Book Review,"This book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban, was a very good book. Harry is going to his third year of Hogwarts. I think this book is a great! It was funny and lots of imaingination. although it was great and all, I couldn't really get into it the first time I read it. I give this book four stars beause it was interesting and it was as good as the ""Sorcceres Stone"", and the ""Chamber of Secrets?."
5,WHAT THE IS WRONG WITH U PEOPLE,How do you not like this book. Anyone who gives this book lower then a five obiously does not understand the buety of Harry Potter. It's impossible not to like it. I've read it like 10 times and every time it's sooooooooooooo surprising when they are talking in the whomping willow. ...Beats alll the books by a longshot.
5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST!,"I am 15, and I love these books to death! The third one is sogreat! Keeps you right on the edge of your seat. Thanks so much JK Rowling, for telling the world of Harry Potter."
5,The best book in history!,This book is so much better than the other two books. Harry has a much bigger adventure. Much more danger. It's one of the best books I've ever read!
5,Each book just gets better and better!,"I loved this book! I have never read a more interesting, exciting and page turning book! It doesn't make you skip pages because of tedious dialogue or annoying events! It keeps you reading and wondering who is who and what is going to pop out next for Harry! I LOVE THESE BOOKS!"
5,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"This book was really cool! I loved its suspense and action.I reccomend this book to all kids who like to read about different worlds and action filled books.I think what I liked most about this book was that it was ""different"" and that I got to solve the mystery as I read too."
5,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,This book was very exciting and fun to read. It had many exciting points where you could hardly bear to put the book down. I would recommend this book to everyone because the odds are that they will love it(even grown-ups)!
5,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!,"This book is totally cool! It was the best book I've read (and I read the whole Animorph serioes 50 or more books). The plot was great and the detail was better! Enjoy your reading!From, I am anonymous!"
5,I love this book!,This is such of an interesting installment to the series. It's so detailed compared to the movie. It makes you feel like you were there yourself
4,Review,One of the best books I've ever read so far ! The book isn't much different from the movie though
5,It was graet!!!!!!!,J.K.Rowling has writen Hary poter so well that I fell like I was right there.When I order a J.k.Rowling book I what by the mail box for it.
5,Fantabulous,"When I pick up Harry Potter, I can't put him down! I adored the Sorcerer's Stone but felt a little lukewarm about the Chamber of Secrets. It seemed as if J.K. Rowling had lost her steam a little on the second book, so I didn't have high hopes for the Prisoner of Azkaban. However, I will happily eat my words. It was wonderful! She has such a wealth of wonderful ideas that make it a truly enjoyable read - there are so few books that really are that way that you can't help but appreciate the innocent charm of Harry and Hermione and Ron - even the odious Draco Malfoy and the terrifying Lord Voldemort. I can't wait for the next in the series!"
4,After reading Harry Potter #3...11/5/12,I gave this book 4 stars because it was exciting and fun l recommend this book to everybody that like to read. This book is about that Harry potter goes to Hogwarts for his third year.Then he met professor Lupin.
5,Best Harry Potter book so far,"Great book, very well-planned plot. I was amazed by the connections Rowling made. Couldn't stop reading it even if I was extremely sleepy. Definetely worth reading!"
5,Ali,"""Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban"" is a great addition to the Harry Potter series. In fact, I think that it is the best one out of the threesome. I liked how the characters seemed older and the surprise twist ending was great!! I can't wait for the next one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Very good,"Explained a lot I missed in movie. Waiting for the next, my 12yr old will be proud of me now"
4,Harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban,"Amazing, if you are questioning buying it, just buy it! Plot twists, triumphant heroes and heroins, and the dursleys at their best."
4,Keep reading the books get better and a bit darker,The first Harry Potter book was the hook that assured I'd buy all the rest of the series. I switched to hardcover because the paperbacks were bulky and hard to read. By book three Harry Potter has had his close calls and the author is beginning to increase the intensity of the characters. There are fewer laughs and certainly more drama. If you enjoyed books one and two you should enjoy the rest.
5,Awesome,I love all of the Harry potter books. I can't stop reading them. They just get better and better as you read more.
5,HP Good as ever.,"Always good for long drives, passing the time and miles. Jim Dale is never dull and listening to his reading of Harry Potter makes time pass quickly and unstressfully in what otherwise would be stressfull situations."
5,Best Series Ever Written!,"I started loving to read a few years back in the summer, and ran out of books in my spare time. My sister recommended these books for me, and I started them halfheartedly. After a few chapters of the first book I was completely enticed and couldn't stop reading! I love these books and have read them over 5 times. These are a great read for grades 4-8. They are well written and teach life lessons of friendship and courage. I would recommend these as a great Christmas/Birthday gift for anyone who loves to read!"
5,A Truly MAGICAL Book !,"This book is filled to the brim with action, suspense, and Magic,with a dash of humor. Resourceful Harry Potter could well be Frodo's (From Lord of the Rings) little brother."
2,Rulers targets marks,"Warning! Hardcore fans stay far away from this book. The author, Robert Picarello, is an editor for an ""Apter""-style mark magazine. This book never strays from kayfabe to delve into the real world of professional wrestling. There are better and more accurate books out there. Most of the information here can be found easily on the net."
5,Excellant book!,"This is a must-have for carousel enthusiasts(sp?)!The drawings are large and easy to see,and kids will spend a while coloring the pictures!"
4,Works fine,"This mitt exfoliates fine. In the photo on the website, it appears to me to be thin, flimsy and slightly see-through but that is not the case. It is one of the thickest exfoliating materials I have seen and fits perfectly on 3 fingers. I use the cleanser-free method, and you can really see the dead skin cells, sebum, leftover moisturizer, etc on this mitt! However, it does not rinse clean with just water like some other microfiber cloths; if you use the cleanser-free method you must use soap by hand or in washer after every time you use it to get rid of bacteria. I would recommend other cloths for the cleanser-free method such asNuFountain Microfiber Exfoliating Cloth For Face or Body"
4,Definitive and authoritative,"If you are in a big library and stumble across this book (for it is usually found only in libraries, sadly), you can spend several enjoyable hours seeing the amazing variety of marine crafts. For the sea going enthusiasts, there is probably no other single book that brings it all together like this volume.The world wide breadth of the crafts described here is staggering. Europe, Asia, US. Crikey, even the occasional Australian and New Zealander craft! A huge amount of work went into collating all this.A definitive tome. It is also one of these books that will be valuable a century later, as a benchmark of late 20th century marine vessels."
1,though itd be bigger,thought itd be bigger bought it for my brother for an inside joke and it was tiny didnt like it
3,Smokey's Rubber Chickens,"We bought two chickens for our cat to play with - he loves them! Unfortunately, they are not very durable and one has already split open, depositing little white beads everywhere. I don't expect the second one to last much longer. And since the shipping was as much as the price of the chickens, we won't be ordering any more."
4,Gang Starr's Double CD,"I personally enjoyed the CD. Although this CD compilation didn't have the song ""Lovesick"", it had most of the other megahits such as the remix of ""Words I Manifest"", Dwyck '92, Mass Appeal, and the video version of ""Jazz Thang""...and let's not forget ""Just to Get A Rep"". Any fan of Guru and DJ Premier will truly appreciate the double CD, whether the version is clean (which is what I possess) or explicit."
4,The Desi Superman,"Shenshaah is the first ever Superman kind of movie made in India. Like Superman he has a dual life. In first he plays the role of Inspector Vijay (he loves to have the same name in most of his movies), the other being Shenshaah, a menace for the evil.As the Police Inspector he is corrupt so that he can get close to the baddies of the city and then controls them as Shenshaah. Like the usual Superman movie, there is a heroine who loves Shenshaah not Vijay. And in the typical fashion as in SUperman movies, evil is finished at the end. Here the villain played by Amrish Puri is hanged inside the courtroom by Shenshaah. Shenshaah played by Amitabh Bachchan; this is one of his memorable roles ever. Meenakshi Shesadri plays the love interest of Shenshaah. Rohini Hattangadi plays the role of Vijay's mother. She has done justice to her role."
2,Tetras take time to get used,"I was feeding the Tetras, guppies & Barbs Azzo 9-1 micro pellets and had a tough time introducing them to New Life Spectrum Small Fish Formula .5mm Sinking Pellet Fish Food and most of the stuff just settles down... eventually gave up... But will try again with Chiclids or Rainbow fish + Congo Tetras..."
2,Many of the companies in this book don't exist anymore,I have purchased the sixth and seventh edition of this book and the information is very outdated. I have contacted many of the companies in this book and more than 70% are either out of business or have discontinued their work at home programs. I specifically needed computer based home work and out of all the possible jobs this book lists I have only gotten two leads out of the book.
3,Idea Starter,Many entries were franchises. Many take-home work ideas were for local residents only. I don't live by any of the ones that I have qualifications for. But the book did spark some ideas for practical things I could do to find my own sources of work at home projects.
3,"This book had lots of great ideas, if you have the money.","This book had soooo many great ideas. Unfortunately, I don't have the amount of money to put that most of them required. There are a good number of ideas requiring less start up cash, of few of which I am doing more research into. Some of the information is not up-to-date. I called about 3 or 4 of the turnkey business systems that were no longer available or the information was not correct. However, that was only 3 or 4 out of hundreds of resources. I would recommend this book to others."
1,Not What I Expected,"I was looking for a book to give me some sort of a list of companies that would hire home-based workers and thought I had found it in this book. When I finally recieved the book, it was completely NOT what I was looking for. Sure it had a list of companies, but the positions I qualified for were in far away places where I had to become a 'local resident'. Then when I did find that ""one in a million"" company that you could be located anywhere, the company was either out of buisness or no longer hiring homeworkers. I am so glad that I was able to buy this book where I could return it instead of through these [...] websites where I'd have to get a lawyer just to get my [money] back. I am extremely dissappointed in this book and hope others don't make the same mistake that I did in purchasing it."
1,Outdated Information,It seems that every edition of this book has contained seriuosly outdated information. I guess they are selling copies since they keep cranking out new editions. Very Disappointing.
4,Fits PT Cruiser - No Problem,"These fit very well in my 2005 PT Cruiser. They seem darker though than the pictures, but that could vary by what monitor you're looking at. Fits my needs well enough."
4,Amazing,"I'm an admitted Jean Arthur fan. Unfortunately, I was born after the major part of her film career was over, but I managed to get to know her through the late show on tv and her ill-fated tv series.Thankfully, John Oller managed to give Ms. Arthur's fans a view of the private woman that her movies absolutely never hinted at. He thoroughly researched his subject and gave us a glimpse of the lady that I had never been able to comprehend before.Without going into details (and ruining this book for you), I can only tell you that I picked it up and read the entire book cover to cover in a few hours.While Jean Arthur may have been the most famous ""recluse"" that Hollywood ever spawned since Greta Garbo, she was not reclusive at all in some ways. She needed her space and appeared to be comfortable with a certain level of anonymity in her later years. I think that element makes this an exceptional read because Jean Arthur had a lot of substance as a person as well as a strong sense of self-integrity."
4,Her screen persona and life did not match!,"She was a delight to watch in all her films, but it's sad to know life, on the whole, did not bring her the same pleasures."
5,One of the very best,"On sheer talent Jean Arthur ranks with the very best actors in Hollywood history, top five women easily. The reason she is not remembered as well as others like Hepburn and Davis is that she not only didn't play the celebrity game, she abhored the thought of it to the point of being neurotic. Once when asked to do an interview, she responded, ""I'd rather slit my throat.""In a Hollywood biography what most people want is a thorough history of the person, an assessment of their work, an understanding of who this person was or is as an individual and good story telling. John Oller did that with Jean Arthur's bio. I came away from this book with an even greater appreciation of her as an artist and with a sadness at how her abject fear of and disdain for interviews and publicity held her back with the public.I recommend this biography for all those who love stories of Hollywood past and for anyone who likes a good read."
4,Princess or Goblin?,"I applaud Mr. Oller for all that research and the assuidity with which he conducted, tracking down all those friends and neighbors, and laying to rest all the rumors for all time. I still don't feel, however, that I know what was Jean Arthur's problem nor why people put up with her shenanigans as long as they did. I hope the sitcom ""The Jean Arthur Show"" goes into re-runs soon, Mr. Oller makes it sound like a cult classic. His book is thoughtfully written and immensely readable, but very very sad and depressing. I don't think I'll ever watch Jean Arthur again in any of her movies in quite the same way."
4,Makes Me Hungry,"I read this book to my K-2s when I was a media specialist, and have thought of it occasionally and fondly. By chance I saw it today and renewed my appreciation for it. The simple story touches on many near'n dear topics - I like the thrifty side of getting some good out of old potatoes that would otherwise be wasted. Most modern style books featuring various fonts of differing size irk me, but I forgive that nuisance in this book because the story is strong and elemental."
3,huh?,"I loved The Fu-Schnicken's first album.......but that's about it. I don't understand a ""greatest hits"" album with only two records released by them."
5,Best Damn Black Album,"From the epic ""Big Mama (What you gunna do)"" to the introspective ""What they Want"" this album outlines the life of a man named Dave. This is a great album. If you want more information look up Black Dave on Rolling Stone.com (check the trivia section)."
3,Go big mama- lol,"I ordered this cd only because I saw the video on yahoo music. I only like tracks 10 and 13, that's ""Go big mama"" the original and the remix lol. There aren't many songs dedicated to BBWs so of course I had 2 grab it."
4,Fastest 600 pages I ever read,"If you like adventure nonfiction, go no further. This is a compendium of excerpts from lots of other great books, sort of like Reader's Digest. Each chapter is easy to absorb, and they are all absorbing. No matter what you're into, there is probably a cool story about it. And you will read other cool stories about things you never imagined. This book is a great starting point to finding other great works of adventure nonfiction."
3,Too many stories,"As a lover of true adventure stories, I looked forward to the compilation of the great epics of the last 100 years. The brief accounts are, for the most part, lifted from the journals and stories written by the person involved. While it opened the door to many names and perilous tales I had never before read about, the book was somewhat of a disappointment. I found many of the narratives too short and clipped to really give a good picture of what was involved. Several of the stories were about similar incidents (mountain climbing, sailing, etc.) and I think it would have been more effective to have limited the number and expand a bit on the remaining ones. What this book will do, I believe, is to give the reader the incentive to pursue those epics which are of special interest to him or her, and seek to obtain the full account. If this book succeeds in doing that, then it's well worth your time."
4,Points Unknown: A Century of Great Exploration,"This book is a wonderfull compilation of enduring adventures gathered in one volume. Writing that keeps you on the edge of your seat and wondering how these explorers will survive and how they could have possibly survived these hardships. Unbelievable courage, determination, and the desire to survive are written about in this book."
4,"Good stories, but where are the maps?","This is a collection of adventure and survival writing by twentieth century authors, chosen by one of the editors of Outside magazine. Some of the selections are well known, such as those from Shackleton's Antarctic expedition and Odell's description of his search for Mallory and Irvine on Everest. Others, e.g. about spelunking and cave diving, will be new to most readers. Most of these pieces are well written. But not one of them is illustrated with either a map or a picture. It is astonishing that a book so heavily focused on geography would confine itself to words. Is it really that expensive to include maps?"
4,Brief but intriguing,"These adventure vignettes are well done and, for the most part, read easily and quickly. The one draw-backI noticed is that a number of the story lines are very similar which can get somewhat old to the reader. Otherwise,if you want some intriguing and spell-binding mini-adventures, I recommend this book."
3,An airport lobby book,"Anyone with any knowledge or interest in the subject articles within this book will be unsatisfied with its format. Ten or fifteen pages of exerpt simply doesn't provide enough background for a serious reader. At best, it's a primer for getting your hands on the original stories which peak your interest. For this reason, I was totally unwilling to purchase the book at its outrageous cover price when first published. It's now being offered at a price justified by it's superficial coverage."
5,Great Textbook,"A textbook that keeps my interest. It is easy to read and understand, the authors haven't dumbed it down just explained things better. The pictures, charts and time lines are wonderful and very helpful. Could even be used for high school, will recommend this to home schoolers."
2,They sent a wrong item.,"I payed for a textbook combined with reading sources, but I got a textbook only, it took a long time and was onerous for verifing this mistake for return."
1,terrible purchase,"I am very disappointed in this purchase as the copy I received says ""Free Copy for Instructors -- Not for Resale"" in a red band across the top of the book. In reviewing my order I can see tiny print in the item picture; however, I did not realize that you would be cheating people by selling a book that is clearly marked as Not for Resale!!"
5,Classic Asimov non-fiction,"If I have any complaint, it's that Asimov didn't live well into his 80s and update this books. It was written in 1973, before the rings of Jupiter were discovered. It's sad that so many of Dr. Asimov's great works on astronomy are outdated, as they are true classics.This book talks about the atmosphere, moons, size and other features of Jupiter, but the highlight has to be Asimov's descriptions of what it would be like to look out from each of Jupiter's inner moons."
1,"Looks nice, but not worth the price","If you want a book filled with colorful pictures of tatting, you'll find them here. But, if you want patterns to tat all those pretty projects be ready for a surprise, because you won't find most of them. The first half of the book is filled with pictures of tatted projects, but no patterns to accompany them. The ""New Twist"" must be the use of obscure threads for most of the patterns given. Not only are these threads *not* readily available to tatters, there is no reference for conversion to the cotton or silk threads tatters usually use. Most of the patterns included are not especially unique, not enough to justify the relatively high cost of the book. Save your money, don't buy this one."
1,Lots of potential but no patterns,"I was so excited when my mom gave me this book for my birthday, but my excitement quickly gave way to disappointment when I realized that no patterns were given for the lovely items pictured in the first half of the book. The designs that do have patterns aren't all that different from those you could find in less expensive books. I'm also a bit intimidated by her use of unfamiliar threads as I don't know what size they are in order to make a substitution. I think the title ""More than 100 Glorious Designs"" is a misnomer since there are only about fifty actual patterns given. The one pattern I did attempt had such horribly written instructions that even with looking at the photo I had to give up."
1,"If you really want to see this book, go to the library!","I was disappointed by this book. I found was a book with a lot of nice pictures, but not much in the way of innovative design. None of the pictures shown in the Gallery section of this book had corresponding instructions, and those were the best part of the book! The patterns that were in the book didn't have much of a new twist to them; one would find similar designs in other, less expensive books. The one positive in this book is that the photos can give you ideas for design."
2,"Glorious photos, not much content","A disappointment to me. I have no idea on what the ""new"" twist is supposed to be. The patterns have been around since the turn of the century. At best a coffee table book. Many of the photos do not have pattern instructions. Save your money"
2,"Pretty Pictures, Recycled Patterns","There are indeed very lovely pictures of tatting in this book, but almost ALL the patterns are in the Julia Sanders book that is only $3.95. For patterns, save your money and get Tatting Patterns by Julia E. Sanders."
2,Well....,"There are some lovely patterns in this book, but not nearly enough for the price, or for the thickness of the book. Many of the patterns fulfill the stereotype of lace and doilies as ridiculous, frilly, useless things that one has to create a use for. Who is going to tat a sweater for a teddy bear, or a lace cover for a vintage perfume bottle, or a little doll hat? That aside, there are a few lovely doilies, a couple nice edgings and medallions, but like other reviewers, I would recommend getting this through your library."
4,exellent!,"Clanbook Assamite revised Is very Informative on the children of Haqim their struggles with the infernal Baali and their uprise in the first city..also the history on Mount Alamut and how the clan founder came to discover it along with his disciples makin it their homebase ,and then started their teachings more in depth there away from the other children of cain,Also other levels of the quietus discipline and obfuscate, the rituals presented are also very helpful.. overall this is a exellent book to build a assamite character or give more depth to an existing one.."
1,"This is a Very Cheesey, Very Bad Imitation of the Late Liberace","Jon England obviously is trying to imitate the late American showman Liberace's style of playing the piano. And it just doesn't work. Yes, the piano playing is ""beautiful"" but after about two minutes worth, you are wondering if the elevator doors will ever open because this is the kind of gooey, saccharine music that is played in elevators. The spinning chandeliers above, next to, and around the piano are an obvious (and weird) imitation of Liberace's famous soliltary candelabra. When this guy gets to Vegas like Liberace did and is making a million dollars a week like Liberace did and has a million fans like Liberace did, maybe I'll re-consider. Until then, let Liberace rest in peace!P.S. Even my 73-year old grandmother didn't like this DVD!"
2,Woman of Substance,"I was very disappointed with this movie. The actors seemed false & unprofessional.Having read the series of books, the movie didn't even compare. I wish I had savedmy money!!!!!"
3,Passable,"A good yarn, but lacking in depth and character development. Emma Harte is sort of an English Scarlett O'Hara -- all her business dealings turn to gold, but her personal life is a mess, including children who (understandably) grow to hate her. Choppy editing, stereotypical characters, and melodramatic situations abound, but it's generally entertaining in a soap-opera-meets-Harlequin-romance way."
2,great story with terribly acting and screen play!,Great story with terribly acting and screen play (except for actress playing the star role!One can barely make out that there is a story line to follow here! Hideous screen play. But nostalgic seventies-esque sound track and staging!
4,good to read,"The book itself was great - I enjoyed this witty novel all the time.But there are some misspelled words in kindle edition, which should be amended soon."
1,Comming Up for Air,could keep reading it . I got lost to many times and I am a fisherman but this was to much. Wasted my money
3,Coming up Short,"I read this book for a book club discussion we will have in January. I was actually really enjoying the story and the great writing by Orwell until the end. I'll be anxious to hear my club's take on the story as I was expecting an entirely different ending.I could feel the character's frustration with his life....He was in a loveless marriage, he found no joy in his children, he hated his job and as if that wasn't enough he expected the bombs to start falling on his country at any moment. He wore his regret like a suit and I could physically feel his angst.But I was disapointed when he returned to the life he so regretted. I had in my mind how it would end and it did not have him returning to the familiar and sad life he hated."
2,Boring,There is a reason 1984 and Animal Farm are the famous ones this book is dull. It is the story of a man who first recounts his life before the war and then decides to take some sick leave and visit his old home. Most of the book seems to be devoted to fishing. It is sufficiently cynical but sometimes a plot is nice. Orwell should never use the Hemingway's style. Its not him. I looked all through the book and couldn't find a plot.
5,"Jars of Clay have excellant balance, many-layered texture","I've had the Jars of Clay CD since it first came out, round about 3 years ago. All the songs are great and I never get tired of them. If I do get into other music for awhile, no matter what, I ALWAYS come back to Jars of Clay. They are like my haven when life is bad; I listen to them and am reminded of what real life is like. In new music the quality of talented musicians is often lacking, but in J of C's music, it is rich and full of intermingling parts which really makes it wonderful. The vocals and good old fashioned HARMONY is something good music needs and J of C has it! This is an excellant CD and everyone who knows me has heard or has J of C because I am so enthused over them. I suggest you buy it today!"
5,AWESOME!,"this has got to be the greatest cd i have ever heard. of the 10 songs, there is only 1 that sint flat out awesome. my favorite is ""like a child"", because of just how true the main point of the song is. also, the song ""flood"" is just GREAT! i recommend it to fans of all kinds of music. and if you dont like it right away, give it a second or third chance. it really starts to grow on you after a while, to the point that you just cant stop listening to it every time that you get the chance. i know that i cant, and im sure that you wont be able to either. if i could, i would definately give it 6 out of 5 stars, but it wont let me. over all, it is just awesome!"
5,"More spiritual than ""Much Afraid""","Well, the lyrics of the songs in this album are nice. I mean, compared to the songs in ""Much Afraid,"" the messages of every song directly talk to God. EXCELLENT - 5 STARS!!!"
5,not only for CCM listeners!...,"although i'm not a fan of CCM, i must say that i really liked this album for its unique sound and lyricism of the band...my favorite song out of this cd would definitely be WORLDS APART. other standouts are Like A Child, Flood, Liquid, Boy On A String.....i really recommend this cd even if you don't like CCM because i myself being a alternative/rock/rap listener have fallen inlove with JOC's music."
5,As Good As They Come,"This album didn't take getting used to. This album has never grown tiresome. You can listen to this album from start to finish. (Well, actually, you can stop when those extra Blind session recordings come in following the excellent hidden track.) The album flows together very well. The two followup albums are both very good but this album still sets the standard. Although ""Flood"" got all the attention, I consider the high points to be ""Lovesong for a Savior"" and ""He."" ""He"" is as beautiful a song as I've heard. I'm not a crier, but that song has brought tears to my eyes."
5,Looking beyond the empty Cross...forgetting what MY life has,World's apart...worth the whole cd...and yet the rest of the album is also great! Get it - seriously!
1,Horrific,"Ok, I heard Flood recently(I know this has been out for like ten years now). Real cool song, but that's all. This album really sucks. It's really mellow and almost boy-bandish. The drum machine the band utilizes is laughable. This is a horrible record. Thats all"
4,It's obvious 1994-1996 was the best period in music,"I am a fan of all kinds of music inside or outside of the Christian genre. And this was the time when we had stuff from P.O.D. and my personal favorite Gospel group, Out of Eden. And this had to be the essential choice.There are some Christian bands I don't like that much. I'm not a big Third Day fan in their new stuff.But most of these songs are great. I mean by up there with Project 86. And it's a good thing Flood was a pop crossover. This is even better than Sixpence None The Richer when they crossed over, in which JOC stay more in the Christian subject. I only didn't like #3 and #10. But I kinda like 10, just because of the bonus track."
5,I'm JEWISH and I love this album!!!,"Let me first state that I am Jewish and I think this is one of the most beautiful cds I have ever heard. Of course the lyrics aren't really for me... but the music and the singing and the musicianship is incredible. Amazing band. Recommended for anyone who loves awesome music, even if you're not Christian."
5,EXCELLENT!,It's an inspirational CD...i'm addicted and have to listen to it everyday...hope you'll buy it and enjoy it too
5,Wow!,"Jars of Clay is incredible! I cried when I first heard the song He. I played it for a friend of mine going through problems at home, and it practically turned her entire outlook around. Their songs are passionate, and can really touch you, if you let it."
5,Heat Touching,This is such a great Cd . Filled with really powerful words. Love Song for a Savior is one of the most perfact songs I have ever heard. Everybody who is into Christian Rock really should check this out. Even my none Christian frinds have this CD and they love it!
2,Mediocre,"I was introduced to Jars of Clay with ""The Eleventh Hour"" album, which I truly enjoy. I bought this album based on the high review ratings, but I found the music to be mediocre--I just don't enjoy the melodies on this album. There are only two that I consider to be OK. A much better album:The Eleventh Hour"
2,"""Flood"" is good; the other songs aren't","When I heard the song ""Flood"" on Christian radio, I instantly fell in love with it. A year later when I heard it on mainstream radio, I knew I had to buy this album. Ugh..I'm sorry I did. ""Flood"" is the *only* reason to buy this album; the rest of the songs don't even measure up to it's greatness (in fact, they are quite boring.) So, if you really love the song ""Flood"", get this CD. Otherwise, skip it."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to getting this CD, and now that I have it I have to say that I was really disappointed. There are only two really good songs -- ""Liquid"" and ""Flood"" -- and everything else is frankly pretty boring. I wish I had just taped the songs I liked off the radio and saved my money. Sorry JOC fans! Had to be honest."
5,Great,Awesome. Great diversity of instruments and song subjects. Interesting voices. All time classic Christian Rock CD.
5,Gotta Love it!,"I first heard of Jars of Clay from a friend. She said that they had a Youth group shaking the floor, listening to ""Flood"". Then I got to hear it and when I heard the song I just knew I had to have it."
5,kids love this,"Bought this for my five year old niece, she loves it, she's nine now and still watches this episode regularly, she has the complete collection now, believe me kids love it."
4,A hot steamy page turner,"Another page turner by excellent writer Penny Vincenzi. The plot is drawn out to almost unbearable lengths that at times becomes tiresome. But the characters, as always with this writer, captivate and you care about their outcome. I wish Penny would return to the historical milieu, her trilogy about the Lytton family was so superior to this women's jargon."
2,Outrageous waste of time,I have read many books by Penny Vincenzi and have never been disappointed until I read this one. I can't believe she actually wrote this garbage. It was drawn out and boring. I could not even get interested in the characters. Love this author but this book was a big disappointment.
2,An Outrageous Affair,I devoured the trilogy beginning with No Angels. I am so dispointed with this book. There is no character that I liked or even cared about. I was very disapointed with the book. I guess the premiss is that sex sells.
2,Disappointment,"A disappointmentI have read all of Penny's books, she is my favourite author but this book just does not work for me. So much is made of the ""book"" within the story, which then just fizzles out into nothing and leaves the reader feeling quite deflated"
4,Intriguing,I loved this book. I like how it spans multi-generations and shows how the past can influence the future even after many years have gone by
3,AN OUTRAGIOUS AFFAIR,"I have read and enjoyed the majority of Penny's novels but this one fell short for me. Too many sex scenes, too much detail, too long, boring ... it's up there with ""Windfall"" which I did not enjoy either ..."
5,"Great Game, Classic RTS","The Command & Conquer Generals series helped start the biggest push towards more and better RTS (Real-Time Strategy) games. The graphics may not be up to par with today's standards, but the mechanics and play style is still excellent, many of the newer RTS's still using very similar setups."
4,Simply a classic. Buy it now!,"My God, I used to listen to this album (round thing made of plastic, with hole in the middle) back in the 70s. Man, it still holds up well after all these years. Great songs, executed well. So glad I stumbled upon it again...............1 Click. It's mine! Get your own."
4,Where's the remastered version,we're all waiting for the remastered version with bonus cuts.this is the only airplane cd yet to receive this treatment.whats the record co. waiting for. lets go while we're young!
4,END OF THE ROAD FOR THE J.A.,"RECORDED LIVE AT WINTERLAND IN SAN FRANCISCO IN 1972, THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED AT THE END OF THE RUN FOR THE JEFFERSON AIRPLANE, BEFORE THEY SPILT UP INTO HOT TUNA AND JEFFERSON STARSHIP. AT THIS POINT IN TIME, JORMA AND JACK WOULD OPEN THE SHOW FIRST AS WHAT WOULD LATER BE CALLED HOT TUNA, AND THEN THEY WOULD BE JOINED BY THE REST OF THE MEMBERS OF JEFFERSON AIRPLANE. THE BEST CUT ON THE ALBUM IS THE ELEVEN MINUTE ""FEEL SO GOOD"", WHICH IS STRICTLY JORMA KAUKONEN AND JACK CASSIDY AT THEIR BEST (WITH SOME HELP BY PAPA JOHN CREACH). NOT AS GOOD AS THEIR EARLIER STUFF, AND IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A REALLY GREAT LIVE JEFFERSON AIRPLANE ALBUM YOU SHOULD PICK UP ""BLESS ITS' POINTED LITTLE HEAD"" INSTEAD, THAT ONE IS INFINITELY BETTER, WITH SOME GREAT VOCALS BY MARTY BALIN ON IT, TOO."
4,cool shoes,This pair of shoes is really nice and performs fantastically. I highly recommended to get it if you're playing basketball. They also look great!
1,Not as listed,"The description says thsat the display case has NO unsightly injection marks and that it comes with graphics. Neither is true. I can substitute my own graphics, so that is not a huge issue, but this item had a large snd prominent injection mark at the top center of the case. I would not have purchased this if the description had been accurate."
5,More than I expected.,"I bought the ""Unofficial Guide to Cruises,"" when I saw it listed when buying other books. It was much more than I expected and I enjoyed it very much. The way the cruise lines is broken down, and how to choose a line based on what you are looking for were very nice features. Great buy!!"
2,Too much work!,I was looking for a cruise to Europe--so I bought this book. Save your money. This book is poorly organized. My husband and I wasted several hours trying to figure out how this book was organized. Then we realized it was not organized at all. I actually gave up and bought another book.
2,"No great secrets revealed in this ""unofficial"" guide","This book is very thorough and detail oriented for the novice cruiser, but no ""insider information"" is revealed for an experienced traveler. If you have never cruised, or don't want to take the time to read the brochures, search the internet and ask lots of questions, this books may be for you. If you want to know things that aren't readily available from other sources (see above), you won't find any ""unofficial"" information in this publication. Your best bet for that type of info are different cruise interest sites on the web or ""Cruise Travel"" magazine."
3,It's okay,"This is an okay book as an overview to some of the lines. It reads like Wikipedia. If you want to save the online research it's nice that its all in one place. But if you want to save the cash, do a wiki search."
4,Up to date,This is an accurate and up to date guide book. The information is comprehensive and reliable. It is highly recommended.
5,simply the best,"Showker's cruise guide is right on target, what the Fielding guide once was before the reviews became dated. I love her focus on value for money, descriptions of fellow passengers and the comprehensive coverage of all aspects. Great for first timers or the experienced cruiser."
5,The Unofficial Guide to Cruises 2001,"For planning our first cruise, this book is excellent. Prior to reading this book, even though I had spent countless hours on the web, I was uncertain as to the best cruise choice for us. This book provides so many details that made it a simple matter to compare ships and make a decision. Especially helpful is the information on fellow passengers and recommendations to find the ship that best matches one's preferences. The detailed descriptions of the ships' features and life styles were extremely valuable in making a selection. The section on preparing for the trip and settling in is great for first-time cruise travelers. So much information is crammed in this book, and it is very well written. Would be nice to have an index, but the book is well organized so that one can easily bookmark sections of interest."
4,"Not as complete as the ""Frommer's Carribean Cruise"" book","I had already booked my cruise when I purchased this book. I was looking for details on shore excursions, shipboard info and how to get to the port of Miami. Frommer's Carribean Cruise book had more of the information I was looking for. This ""Unofficial Guide to Cruises"" would be good if you were trying to decide which cruise to take. But again, there wasn't any information on what I was looking for in shore excursions, sightseeing, maps, etc."

2,"great songs, poor recording",This would have been a great show to have witnessed. Very few live recordings have the quality of sound that we are so accustomed to these days and this is no exception. This recording does convey the spirit of the event and the sheer enjoyment of the musicians in performing. Hopefully their studio recordings have the same good qualities and good recording as well. That is what I am purchasing next and advising whoever reads this to do.
5,Truly Inspirational,"I go to the same school that Savannah, Mr. Lawford's daughter goes. I heard about this book from my mom and dad. My mom bought the book, and really liked it. I've never heard her cry and laugh so much all at the same time. I was really curious, so I asked her if I could read it and my mom of course let me. I too enjoyed Mr. Lawford's book very much. I'm actually going to write an essay for my class on Mr. Lawford and his book. I also have an older brother, who's had problems with drugs, but he's now clean, thank God. Reading about the addiction and recovery, Mr. Lawford's journey was truly inspirational to me."
1,When all is said and done,"what we are left with is another middle-aged male who had to leave his wife (who stayed through all the s**t)and children in order to ""find himself"". Not suprisingly in the arms of a YOUNG blonde ""angel"". Kudos to him for getting sober--a rasberry to him for what he has done with his soberity and to the immediate family who loved him through to it."
3,"I know I'm nitpicking, but...","...But as interesting as parts of Mr. Lawford's story are (especially his pre-adolescent period), I couldn't get past his issue with homonyms. I know editors play a part in this, so who was it that couldn't distinguish between ""bale"" and ""bail"", or ""it's"" and ""its"", or ""than"" and ""then""?Lawford also comes across to me as somewhat egomaniacal, which I guess shouldn't suprise me, since he's an addict and a Kennedy, but for that to come through in his writing was offputting at times."
2,Symptoms of rambling on,"Mr. Lawford had an opportunity to explain causes, consequences and recovery from addiction in a more concise and clearer way. He left holes in parts of his stories and left this reader wondering if he wrote a book just to make money after having squandered his inheritance on drugs, partying and because he could. This book had so many chapters because he repeated himself over and over again, with many times not making a clear point. Very disappointed !"
3,A Fast Read,"I always wondered what the country would have been like if RFK had not been killed and he had become president. After reading this book, I wonder what the Kennedy clan would have looked like if he had lived. Would these cousins have sunk to the depths as they did? It seems the boys were so much more impacted than the girls.Christopher Lawson does a great job in this book helping you to see how the national events were personal ones for himself and his family. It is a fast read with lots of tales from behind the Kennedy compound. But I really wanted to like the guy in the end and I can't say that I do. His spiritual growth has not come full circle to encompass his own family. The only reason I can see for his divorce is so he can continue his hunt for the most beautiful girl in the world. Maybe there are other reasons, but he does not provide them in the book.Oh well, it was good summer reading."
2,Not what I expected,"book was interesting for the first 2/3, but then really lost steam. The title would indicate that the book discusses withdrawal and drug addiction but it really doesn't. Suffice it to say that Lawford did drugs but as far as a ""true depiction"" of harrowing drug use it falls hugely short. Additionally, he speaks of his close relationship with his cousin David who dies but there is no real in depth or emotionally revealing description of how this really affected him. His story is interesting enough but it's a surface tale with a few anecdotes thrown in. The bits about the Kennedys and the Lawfords were the most interesting and it's too bad he couldn't have really looked inward and given us a great read. A Million Little Pieces by James Frey is a much better depiction of abuse and recovery. This ""bio"" leaves much to be desired."
3,"OK, But Flawed","Just finished reading this book. I think Mr. Lawford is a good writer, goes into a lot of detail, perhaps too much at times. I could only read a couple of chapters in one sitting before I became so depressed, I had to put it down. The question I kept asking myself was this: How, with his numerous arrests, was he able to get into law school, let alone finish. I thought most law schools don't take students with arrest records. Was this because he was a ""Kennedy""? I also thought it odd that he did not have an index in the back of the book. He explained why he choose not to do that, but I still thought it odd. I wish him well."
2,The Poster Boy for Poor Choices,"I guess it takes a former druggie/alcholic to appreciate this barren endeavor by Mr. Lawford, who, incidentally, lived near Jack ""Lemon"" and is a KENNEDY, don't you know! Hey, Doll, how about writing at least several consecutive paragraphs without pointless profanity? It's amazing how someone could make such poor choices in their life over, and over, and over. Considering the pain he felt at his own parent's divorce, one would think he would try to hold on to his marriage a little harder - what selfishness and self-absorbtion!"
1,disturbing book,poorly written by an extremely maladjusted person who seems to capitalize on his family connections. it was a waste of time.
2,What happened to the light?,"This book got such rave reviews and it was a compelling read up until the end. All this talk about how the author survived and ""stepped into the light"". I kept reading because I thought it was going somewhere but in the end, recovery aside, he still rationalizes and justifies destroying his own immediate family in order to live ""an authentic life."" Brave confessional -- sure, but he also used the book to get even with people who'd hurt him and I don't like when authors do that. He is a good writer but that doesn't mean he's got character, aside from the recovery. He knows this is true but not to the extent that it is true. His recovery does seem miraculous."
5,Amazing read!!!,Just read your book. Your mother WAS right...you are a good writer. If I read a book it has to keep my interest beyond the 1st paragraph & yours did...thanks!
4,Life as Part of the Kennedy Family,"I believe this book was honestly written by Chris Lawford andthru his eyes what it is like to grow up on a very famous family.Not only the Kennedy family but the Lawford family and Hollywood.And how he handled the pressures...drugs, etc....good and bad."
5,symptoms of withdrawal,"Interesting book. I think I enjoyed it more because I had just finished reading his fathers biography, so I knew a lot of back story. After reading the details of his herion addiction, it is amazing that he is still alive! If your are interested in old hollywood stars, or the Kennedy family you will find this book interesting."
3,Symptoms of Withdrawal,I am enjoying Christopher Lawford's story of his addiction. It also chronicles a historical era in our American past which is of great significance.
5,Thank you!,"I just finished reading ""Symptoms of Withdrawal"" and just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed the read. I hated for your book to end. I too, am a recovering alcoholic, addict and so your book hit real close to home for me. Thank you for writing it and for being so honest."
3,very sad read,"I just read this book and feel very saddened by it. In spite of a ""spiritual"" epiphany that led Chris to finally put his addiction behind him, I think he is still very troubled. He freely discusses his fears that, as a father, he'll repeat the mistakes of his ""old man."" Why, why, then would he leave three beautiful kids who were devastated by the break-up of their family? Jeannie struck me as a woman who stood by Chris through arrests, near-death experiences brought on by drugs, and infidelity. She did not dissolve the family. Part of becoming a whole person is realizing that the needs of others--particulary the children you bring into the world--must come before your own at times, and it is noble to consider them first. I do feel for Lawford in that his own father certainly failed him...and by the way, there's nothing ""classy"" or ""graceful"" about that man. Admit it."
3,Good overall but lacking in some areas,"I thought this was a good book, but like others said, repetitious. How many times is he going to say that ""she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen"". He finally towards the end realized how many times he has said that and makes light out of it by saying she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen since the last beautiful girl I had seen. He doesn't take the time to explain how he really even met his wife. Reading this book you can't help being depressed. His father seemed like a pretty depressed, pathetic cocaine snorting loser. His sisters were barely mentioned. Being a Kennedy somehow now doesn't seem like such a glamorous existence."
3,Readable but disturbing,"The first thing that struck me about this book was all the gratuitous cursing. I'm not troubled by cursing in everyday life but it felt wrong in this book somehow. It made me not like him right from the start. The second thing that bothered me was his discussion of the end of his marriage - what a bunch of mid-life crisis, hokey, self-absorbed crap. ""I wasn't meant to live by traditional confines"" and that sort of nonsense. And this is from a reader who has been divorced twice!Other than that it was a quick, absorbing read. Some of the stuff he reveals about himself - the episode where Keith Moon humiliated him for example - are shocking in their honesty. It was painful to know."
5,the book really moved me,"Saw chris on larry king and very moved by his gratefulness and spirituality...I hate to say but can't remember the last book that I have read from front to back (almost there). I love the honesty, and wit, such dertermination to screw up and then such determination to make it...very inspiring."
2,This bore has been supported by your tax dollars.,This book reveals little we didn't already know about the Kennedy rat pack. Except I didnt know what an animal Pat Kennedy was. That was the author's mother. The author is very selective about revealing Kennedy misdeeds. He is the biggest egotist of them all but has little to base it on. Does he have a facial deformity? Can he close his mouth fully? None of the photos show that ability. Even his baby photo on the cover is slack jawed. He brags about his addictions but shows little evidence of them. He did get several degrees while supposedly under the influence. Eventually leaving his loving wife and kids for a younger woman was the icing on the cake of a useless life and a reason to greatly increase the death tax for rich people so parasites like the author learn to work for a living or become homeless.
5,At His Best,"Mystikal is definitely at his best on this album nowadays Kal ain't all that and of course with his rape charges i guess he put out the greatest hits to get some kind of an appeal goin(haha) yea thats kinda wrong but hey its the truth i guess but this album along with ""Unpredictable"" and ""Ghetto Fabulous"" are his absolute best works I have all 3 and still bump every one of them definitely worth your money Pick it up."
4,How to Save Salmon - Lessons from History,"Montgomery's book is centered on the notion that we are failing to learn from history when it comes to the Pacific salmon crisis. In England, eastern North America, and now the Pacific Northwest, human actions that inevitably destroy the ""king of fish"" have been repeated. Overfishing, blocking salmon from their spawning habitat, and causing the deterioration of habitat quality through pollution, land clearing, and simplification of the river are the culprits. Montgomery also tells why hatcheries are not the solution and never have been. He closes with a clear and, to me, indisputable analysis of what we must do to preserve and recover this most amazing of creatures. The book is quite accessible to a layperson; you don't need a scientific background, or even any knowledge of the problems facing Pacific salmon, in order to enjoy and learn from the book."
4,"readable, balanced, not preachy","I can only add to what the three previous reviewers have said in praise of this book. I make my living through irrigated agriculture, and so am intimately involved in the myriad of issues surrounding the survival of these incredible creatures. Dr. Montgomery's book is a good introduction to basic salmonid biology (a topic most of the public, including ""activists"" are shockingly ignorant of), is blessedly free from jargon and acronyms, and recounts the sad history of our interactions with this fish without didactic and self-righteous screaming."
2,Not Satisfied,I have put over a 1000 rounds through this thing now and I still never know where its going to hit. I have used 2 different scopes with no success.I really wouldn't recommend this one.
1,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","It's a shame that the makers of this DVD put little to no effort into maintaining the quality of the original print. The pictue quality is below the standard of VHS (perhaps a PAL conversion?)and the sound has been mixed so poorly that you often can't hear what's being said due to the overbearing effects track. If you can manage to look past this butchering, you may be able to appreciate this great example of '70's Australian culture."
1,My only disappointment from Amazon!,".This is a GREAT movie!This DVD is a LOUSY copy, with a difficult to hear vocal soundtrack, mostly drowned out by the music and FX.After I advised them of my disappointment, the nice people at Amazon sent me a replacement copy, but that was just as bad as the first one.I have copies of this movie going back over 25 years on various video (tape) formats, so I know what the David Williamson dialogue should sound like.A wonderful piece of late 1960's Australiana, which unfortunately is spoilt.For my money, try and get yourself one of the VHS versions, as this one is not worth the plastic it is burned into."
2,Nothing to lose not watching this movie,Something of drunken sex and same gender attraction on a landscape of the Australian Labour Party supporters' affairs.I would nothing lose not watching this movie of homoeroticism and bubs exposed.
5,Excellent!,"Another great CD of Chris Tomlin's with poetic worship lyrics which often paint pictures in your mind and are acompanied by fitting and rich intrumental. I also appreciate his voice. As with his previous CD's, these beautiful and majestic songs inspire me to worship my God.As far as this particular edition, it contains five bonus songs, just as excellent as the rest, which are not on any other editions of this CD that I know of. So this CD (in particular, this edition) is a must have. The tracks are as listed:1. How can I Keep From Singing2. Made to Worship3. Let God Arise4. Everlasting God5. Glory in the Highest6. Awesome is the Lord Most High7. Glorious8. Uncreated One9. Rejoice10. Let Your Mercy Rain11. Amazing GraceBonus songs:12. Enough (acoustic)13. Made to Worship (acoustic)14. How Can I Keep From Singing (acoustic)15. Over Me (original demo)"
1,VERY POOR SERVICE,I still haven't received this item and I would not recommend this company to anyone!
1,"""You remind me of my Jeep""","What The F-/* you tring' to say? I look like a truck? I will run your pis-y a-"" over"
3,Another Decent CD but a bit weaker,"With his thrid CD in three years, R.Kelly delivered more of his usual antics. While this CD had it's moments it also had it's share of weak moments. The strong moments were the ballads which he's always known for. The first trio of ballads the hit single You Remind Me Of Something, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby and my personal favorite Step In My Room show R's vocals and writing at it's best. The next two strong ballads Down Low (Nobody Has To Know) and ""I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)"" were also good , although the remixes were better. The other strong ballads Tempo Slow was placed at towards the end of the CD but it was placed in the middle of R. Kelly's religous section of the CD."
5,R.Kelly does It again,"When I first bought this CD I didnt think it was going to be great at all. After hearing it again you can understand how he is and how he grew up. Of course the stand out track is Down Low but my favorite track is ""Thank God is Friday"" Buy this CD is shouldnt be that expensive and its worth it!"
4,CLASSIC R,"R kelly began in that 90's generation era, which was my coming out so im kinda partial to the R ( present legal problems excluded ) he is an excellent song writer and producer, he has got that platinum touch no denying that. This Cd is one of his best."
5,The start of R. Kelly,"This is when Robert Kelly became R. Kelly, the start of his great music and talent. With the hit tracks such as ""You Remind Me of Something"", ""Down Low (Nobody Has to Know)"" [the prequel to ""Contagious"" by Ron Isley], I Can't Sleep Baby (If I) and more. If you liked any of R. Kelly's new albums then you'll like R. Kelly ~ R. Kelly."
3,Disappointing,"My son (3 1/2) loves the characters in the First LeapPad book series, but doesn't really enjoy the LeapPad books. The pace is s-l-o-w. The orientation is instructional -- and not very fun. The system depends on the reader pressing a green ""Go"" button to identify which page is active. Every page is framed by a border that is reserved for the successively located ""Go"" buttons. This works fine until your little pre-reader zips the stylus over the full page looking for hidden treasures and triggers a ""Go"" button for a different page. Then everyone's confused. If your child is used to structured learning, they'll probably like this a lot. If your child is used to the pace and interactivity of computer software, save this until they have some preliminary reading skills."
2,Cheap,Knife looks good but is not functional. Knife is only ground and needs extensive sharpening to get a decent edge. The blade lock does not work without modification. Thumb stud is not ambidextrous due to button clearance on the left side. Pocket clip is not flexible enough to work on jeans.
4,The short story: alive and well,"The title story is the perfect example of the storyteller's art. It's heartbreaking and violent, and seems to have been written offhand and casually, but it's the kind of casualness that only comes from years of perfecting the short story. I don't ordinarily like this author's work but the title story alone is worth the price of the ticket."
5,love the series,I loved this series when it was out and still find it entertaining. I am ready for season 3 and 4 to come out on dvd as well.
4,Widescreen for seasons 2 thru 4? Really?,"I loved watching this show back in the '80s during its first-run broadcast. I very much enjoyed watching Season 1 again here on Amazon in its original full-screen glory. The content gets 5 stars from me--for all of the seasons... but the faked widescreen effect which has been foisted on seasons 2, 3, and 4 is beyond annoying. Chopping off the top and bottom of content does not make something ""widescreen"". The show was framed for full-screen... back in the '80s! This is just sad."
4,Love Scarecrow & Mrs. King,I enjoyed watching the series as a kid and for years hoped that it would make its way to DVD. I have seasons 1 and 2 and so far have not been disappointed.
5,Season Two,I was so happy to see the first season of Scarecrow and Mrs. King finally released and would love to have the other three seasons on my DVD shelves. This is a great t.v. show.
5,Great fun!,"I am so happy that the first season of Scarecrow and Mrs King is on dvd... and that I own it! I love the chemistry between the main characters, especially Amanda and Lee. Amanda can be so daffy it's hilarious! I like how each episode has a definite plot but the characters themselves are not sacrificed to it. I can't wait for the other seasons to be released on dvd as well... I'll be waiting in suspense. :)"
5,Love it,"Clean and good time tv, without the violence and sex in its. Funny and a tv series for the whole family to enjoy."
5,Fun for the whole family!!,"I enjoyed watching this with my family when I was little girl. Now my son, a six year old, loves spy shows, but it is hard to find shows that are generally appropriate for his age level. Scarecrow and Mrs. King is a show we can watch together and not cringe at every scene worrying about bad language or overly realistic crime scenes."
5,Top notch Vendor,"The dvd was sent out promptly, and I received it before Christmas. I really enjoyed watching the episodes again. It brought back great memories. I would highly recommend this vendor."
4,Scarecrow and Mrs King,I like the series although at times it gets a little on the juvenile side. Good clean program and fun to watch.
5,Still good fun,Always loved the show and its funny to watch and look back and all the things that have changed but throughly enjoy
5,Great Series,"I love this series. The acting is great. the dialogue is fast and funny. 80's tv at its best!!!If you enjoy Castle, you should like this!!"
1,My French daughter is improving her English!!!,she had so much pleasure watching this show in its original version! she's improving her English and is now looking forward to watching season 2 + !!!
3,Good album for those new to goa/psytrance,"Hallucinogen's Twisted is a good album to get your ears accustomed to the fast, trippy, and melodic sound of goa/psychedelic trance. The pace and general progressions in this album are there, but there's just something missing that keeps it from the upper echelons of the genre. You're better off tracking down releases from Astral Projection, and one song in general is essential: Dancing Galaxy. This song lives and breathes in my CD player and is one of the finest examples of this type of music. It's years old, but it is still the most amazing piece of psytrance I've ever heard. Everyone who hears it is blown away, even to this day."
1,"R rated, profanity. Negative attitude. Not a good trip.","""I'm on f---ing fire"" is repeated loudly on the 5th track, impossible to ignore. This cd has a fry mentality, for example, sinister laughter when a daytripper attitude was possible. This is not a joyful piece. Those desiring peace of mind or relaxation should look elsewhere. Perhaps good for a rave, but the profanity renders this unsuitable for background music in the family den or dentist office. Eliminate the vocals altogether and this would be outstanding Trance."
2,Everybody say Yes Yes I say No No,Probably a lot of Hallucinogen fans doing reviews here...It is not bad not at all but i dont think this record has IT. When you listen to goa you want this final touch and Hallucinogen don't has it..A very talented artist but not enough...
5,Classic World Class Goatrance!,Sonic waves permeate the membranes of perception whilst one undergoes audial absorption and integration. Welcome to the paradox of illuminating darkness. This one is going to be hard to beat. Ever. Surely a milestone in the ever growing library of Goatrance music. A strong five star album. Your Goatrance collection would be incomplete without it.
5,The A-B-C of Psychadelic music,"You're looking to discover what psychadelic music is ?This is the best beggining, if you don't like this album don't look forward to listen to any other psy-trance artist..Simon Posford have the most easy-listening Psy music of all. And also the best!I recommand it all the way!It's the Masterpiece of my sound bank since it come out 4 years ago."
5,Classic Trance Album,"Simon Postford of Hallucinogen knows what's up. I highly recommend this entertaining album. No fluff here. Just eight well constructed, often impressive tracks."
2,umm... not so sure about this one,"To be honest, I used probably less than half this book. I read through the verbal sections and those were ok. I skipped much of the math tutorials because I use math all the time in school. But when I got to scale reading, 3 out of 10 of the samples questions had incorrect answers. That was a shocker to me. How do book editors let 3 errors go unnoticed. Following that, in the mechanical section, there's a statement about how you compare viscosities of liquids.""engine oil has a high viscosity because it flows easily while molasses has a low viscosity because it flows quite slowly.""For those of us who've had a decent amount of exposure to either math, science, or mechanics, we would know this is a complete fallacy. The typist probably got ""high"" and ""low"" mixed up late at night while drinking liters of coffee. But this does a huge disservice to anyone who isn't too familiar with these things.I give this book 2 stars based on the absurdity of the errors."
4,Good for general reference,"This book I think is better than Barron's Officer Candidate School test prep book, however there are still a lot of typos throughout. It's good for general help though.There's more info on it at this link:[...]"
1,Unprepared,I'm not a rocket scientist but I'm not an idiot either. This book is one of the worst test preps I have ever seen. It contains a lot of simple mistakes I'm suprised the publishers did not catch. Plus...many of the test questions are directly recycled from the ASVAB prep book from the same author.
5,excellent gmat prep material,"very challenging problems on statistics, probability & combinatorics. There are enough problems to practice and master math skills for gmat."
4,A moving novel of courage and resilience,"This autobiographical novel recounts one young man's struggle with manic depression (bipolar disorder) as he navigates through New York City hospitals, mental institutions, shelters and AA programs. Unlike many current works masquerading as ""memoirs,"" this is an authentic story, full of genuine hope and heartbreak, balanced by a will to survive, achieve autonomy and ultimately find love."
2,Very basic.,Its a good beginner's book - both on investing and on using Quicken for your investments. Its a bit light on the material I was hoping for: depth about really optimizing my use of Quicken for investment tracking and analysis.
5,Excellent! Worth the purchase price many times over!,"I recommend this book without hesitation. It makes investing much more approachable. For beginners and experts alike, this book has much to offer. Kudos to Price and Langer for a job extremely well done!"
4,Smooth And Relaxing,"The sounds of Grover Washington's saxaphone are indeed very soothing. The special effects from the synthesizers and the precussion merely add to the songs rather than over color them as other artists sometimes do. The themes on each of the songs are quite memorable. Caught A Touch Of Your Love is probably the most memorable piece on this collection as BB King delivers some fine vocals and guitar licks in between Grover's tender saxophone sounds. The Look Of Love, Monte Carlo Nights, and The Title Track also are very memorable mostly due to the balance between the instruments. The bass lines on Monte Carlo Nights are just pulsating. Anyway, its hard to beleive that I am the first one reviewing this recording because this collection defintiely needs to be bought!"
4,A very underrated album.,"Most ATCQ fans hate this cd and I don't know why. It's just so good. Sure, there's no simple, stand-up-bass-driven stuff on it like the Low End Theory, but the lyrics are just as good as ever, and the backing music ain't bad at all. If you're a Tribe fan, don't believe all the non-believers. Buy this album."
3,The end of an era,"This album was the beginning of the end for A Tribe. They'd produced some of the genre's greatest albums in the early 90s.By the time this came out, hip hop was changing a bit. You'll notice that the jazz influence was really non-existent on this one. This has a lot more upbeat, party beats to it; which isn't to say that's bad, but to say that it doesn't seem like the Tribe I grew up on.Still, Phife and Qtip's lyrics were still solid. One major complaint is the new guy, Consequence, who really doesn't seem to fit in. It was a bad idea; I'm not sure what they were thinking.Still, this is a decent Tribe release. It's far from their best but still better than most. This was it for them (if you don't count the horrendous Love Movement); the end of an era."
4,Great Stuff,My nephew gave me a copy of this for Christmas 2001. I knew Q-Tip from his guest appearances on De La Soul and others' albums and was a little familiar with early ATCQ singles like Bonita Applebaum but I was surprised by how much I liked this album. The whole group has great synergy and the beats are excellent. I have maybe 20 rap albums so I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means but as a music fan I really like this album a lot and am glad I have it in my collection.
3,Beats,"A tribe called quest is the greatest rap group of all time. This is Tribe's fourth cd and also their fourth best cd. while it is a decent disc, it lacks the creative flavor of their other three classics. The beats are just not up to par, and the lyrics are a little too preachy, and not abstract which is q-tip's fortay. Not to say this is a bad cd, it just doesn't compare to any of their others, besides The Love Movement, which was terrible. The tracks that stand out are, ""Jam"" and ""once again."" I would rate this a three out of five, but if your not a tribe fan you would probably think this cd is dull and boring."
2,uuuummmmmmmmm,"This could have been the weakest album by tribe. It could be because we have such high expextations for them after their first three discs. You would think they would be able to follow it up. But, they didn't. There are very few tracks that are good, I think my fave is probably Track 4. Unfortunaltely, you can't listen to it straight through like the fisrt three, which is why i give it 2 stars"
1,No Good,When this album came out I ran and bought it because it's Tribe. When I listened to the album I was dissapointed. The beats were corny and the lyrics were wack. The album sounds like it was rushed. There is only 1 good track on the entire album and that's it.
2,Bland beats,"2 1/2Accessibly street-wise, overground hip-hop is head-bobbingly competent but approaching staleness."
5,Greatness,I really don't understand why this album wasn't conidered a masterpiece. I think it flows better than the other ATCQ albums. Two words of advice. BUY NOW
2,Don't get too ready to read this,"With such a beautiful cover and such a career to discuss, I was very exicted about reading this book. But OH MY GOD it was painful. I'm sorry Mr Burns, but I don't care what your personal feelings are about Curtis.. I wanted to read about Curtis' life.. what he went through, how he came to write such beautiful music - but instead you give track by track detail of every album - and thats it. Here's hoping someone can write an interesting book about such an inspirational man."
3,curtis mayfield-another discography?,Pete Burns is obviously a fan but wouldnt it be great if we got a real biography of Curtis? This book is a very comprehensive list of his many record releases and collaborations but true feelings about the man are almost absent. Brief interview details are included but the need really is for more-anyone please?
2,Try Again Next Time,"Borrring. I felt as if I were reading a college term paper written at an 11th grade level. I don't mean to be so harsh but getting through this book was like sitting through a root canal. There just is not enough here to hold one's interest. There is nothing about his personal life and by the time I got through three excrusiating chapters, I was definately done. After reading other biographies and autobiographies of musicians, I feel that this book did not help me to understand Curtis Mayfield or his music. After reading it, I felt very empty. Don't waste your time."
2,Book is more informational than insightful.,"I bought this book for my dad for Father's Day and we were both extremely disappointed when he flipped through it. It is mainly a guide to Curtis Mayfield's recordings and involves very little about his life and interest in music. I say don't buy, there are probably better biographies elsewhere."
3,Definitely cheap!,"The description is not exaggerating - it's definitely the ""cheapest table lamp""... functional, but the paper lantern's rings sag under its own (inconsiderable) weight, and it never stands quite as tall as 10"". Fine for a fun, non-daily use - don't expect too much."
1,Time I'll never get back,All I can say is that the time I spent watching this movie is time I might as well have spent smoking or shooting up because it was a waste.
2,Misleading,"Don't be fooled by the title, this documentary has LITTLE to do with the ""secret diary of the exorcist"" if indeed there was one. I was truly looking forward to this film but found myself falling asleep but watched it all the way through thinking it has to get better. If you are expecting something creepy, frightening or even interesting, this is not the film for you. Very disappointed and I hope the other movie I ordered by the Booth Brothers is not as poor as this one."
3,it was a so so documentary,i am really obsessed with the paranormal so most of the stuff presented on the dvd i heard before. i was hoping to hear more from what was written in the diary. luckily when i ordered from their site they gave me a free pdf file of the diary. i also would have liked to hear more about the hauntings at the hospitals.
5,Informative and fun,"I am a serious painter and I refer to this book often. It is a collection of advice and demos from many contemporary artists. Landscape, portrait, and still life are all represented. The artists' works are quite varied, so the result is interesting and fresh. I enjoy this book and think other artists will too."
4,Very informative but feels a bit lacking at times,"Being new to painting (only about a year) I felt this book gave some good ground work but lacked indepth information for someone just starting out. Don't get me wrong its a great book, packed full of info accross lots of topics, and there is its weakness, too many topics, not enough depth on any one."
2,Not for advanced painters,"This book is not for anyone at an advanced level- whilst there is a whole lot of information, each technique is described in one page, with very little depth. Some of the examples chosen to highlight a particular technique are odd indeed - why for example, if one was showing how to paint ""dappled sunlight"", would the subject matter be a building? I may be odd myself (who knows), but the term 'dappled sunlight' brings a rural/country scene to mind...."
5,Very pleased,"Since I am a new student, I didn't want to pay full price for this book.Great deal and very good condition."
4,Complete railroad industry information source,"Excellent way to bring yourself up on the complexities of the railroad industry. We used the book to bring management consultants up to speed with the information about railroads that they needed to use on an assignment that put them in front of railroad veterans. The average layman can get alot out of this book if he has an interest in railroads. It gets into all aspects from car types, engine sizes, intermodal, and examples of why routes are developed in what seems to the average person as incorrect routes. The cover is a little ""cheesy"" but don't be fooled this is a good buy."
3,Interesting but no more,If you are interested in his work and thoughts and not very interested in his personal characteristics and when he did what this book is probably not for you. Thoroughly researched though.
3,"""Snake Peel"" + ""Desert Minerals"" = Meh","This shower gel has a slightly-citrus tang and foams up well in normal water, which means it'll last you a while since not much is needed for one use. I'm not sure what the ""snake peel"" (or, even more interesting, the ""desert minerals"") are intended to be, but they seem to clean very well, and they did so without drying my skin. This gel comes with blue, exfoliating micro-beads, but there are so few of them that their effect appears to be negligible, as is the after-scent of this so-so shower scrub."
1,What a waste of time and money!,"I bought this book on a whim and man oh man, what a waste of time, money and effort. needless to say it went straight to the trash can!"
3,Neglects to mention Verbal Abuse,This book is a fair treatment of the subject but it is unfortunate that the Author does not address in more detail verbal abuse or respectful interaction between two people. The book could also use more information on being in a relationship with someone who has a personality disorder as well as tips for avoiding a relationship with someone who has such a disorder.
3,Not what I expected,"This book isn't quite what I expected. It has some pretty far-out suggestions and ideas. If one is looking for laughs this is okay, but some of the applications just are not practical."
3,DUHHH,went and highlighted for the BF. Lot of DUHHHH moments in it. It's an okay book I think I laughed at most of it.
3,Raleationships for Dummies,I was hoping for a little more than what this book offered. In my opinion it's more suitable for the younger generation. All new relationships should read this book.
4,decent spice album,"Spice made 1 decent album after this, blackbossalini, then it went down hill from there! Spice was probaly my fave rapper in tha 90s, even better then pac in his prime! hardcore spice fans need this album, cop everything b4 this , cop blackbossalini, and thats it, spice 1 kicked a*s in tha 90s ! no doubt"
5,a great album,All of spice 1's albums are classics and this one is no different this is one of his best.
5,As Advertised,the promises made were right on! mounts easily on to the car window. very steady and easy to remove.great buy!
1,Raymond E. Brown,"Famous scripture scholar Raymond E. Brown, a Sulpician priest is now deceased. This book is not by him"
1,not any good...,"i've read about a hundred outlines in this biblical vien. read, 'WTBIAAFYE' by dr. henrietta mears, it's THE BEST outline of the bible."
1,Discover Aruba VHS - Mark Drenth,"This is only a short video of about 30 minutes. It certainly is not a Hollywood production; probably 2 guys with a camcorder did the whole thing. It was taken in 1993, so it's already 7 years old. It starts with a commercial for ALM airlines also. Don't expect any real specific information, only a broad overview. Overpriced ..."
4,Good Video,"Well, I was at Blockbuster and rented a video on Aruba for a pre vacation appetite wetter. It was all commercials on the hotels and attractions. This was the video by the ""big name"" in travel. While I was in Aruba, there were about 3 to 4 videos done by production companies from LA to Holland, and another by a big name director. I bought them all, as I collect videos from the places I visit. The video by Discover The Caribbean was on par with two others, but the other two and the one I rented in Blockbuster were just commercials. The video is only 30 minutes, but it aint commercials with only one for ALM at the beginning. A good video..."
4,too sheezy,"not a bad compilation brought together by too short showing off the unrecognized talents of his ""dangerous crew"". worth getting if you like original bay area rap. with a little more work put into it, it would easily deserve 5 stars."
4,C'est les histoires cet album,Rien a dire si ce n'est que Too $hort et ses potes a claque c'est tout!
5,Xmas Plates,The plates are everything I hoped they would be and very beautiful. They came quickly and were packed so well. Everyone at Xmas dinner remarked on how lovely they were. I think I may order more pieces for next year. The price was great too!! I would highly recommend them.
4,A RELAXING READING,"It seems we're not at all reluctant to admit how little we know as there are now over 50 million ""Dummies"" books in print. And, thank goodness for many of them, as my ""WordPerfect for Dummies"" has often saved me.Now, we can learn to be tension free with ""stress-busting advice and exercises.""Read by the author, a clinical psychologist, in his most affirming and encouraging voice, he promises that we can combat stress with diet and exercise and even diminish our anger and worry."
2,stress management,i never recieved this product although oredered on 7/7/2010 i sent sellere a email and nvere heard from them
3,Prescribed social roles: who decides,"Eva Knapp is an obsessive, tyrannical mother and homemaker. Her husband Lester is a poet at heart and dreamer who gets fired from his accounting job. Shortly afterward he falls off the roof and is badly hurt. So Eva goes to work and Lester stays home with the kids--a huge success for both of them. But society expects Lester to go back to work again and Eva to stay home ""where she belongs."" Neither one wants this. Canfield explores this dilemma involving traditional roles fairly well, but not with any great skill or insight."
3,Short and not so sweet,"I was somewhat disappointed that this book relies on so many anonymous sources for its information. Many sequences read ""Lucy said,"" then ""Desi said,"" and then ""but a friend of the family says"" and relies on that as the truth. Having said that, it's a nice start/overview on the life of Lucille Ball, but it shouldn't be the only book about her that you read."
3,"Very, very informative","It started in her early years and took you straight through to her death in 1986. Around 200 to 250 pages. It explained a lot of things that I had been wondering about AFTER ""I Love Lucy"". It talked about her kids a lot too. It explained in deep detail about her kids' trials and tribulations while managing at the same time to link everything to Lucille Ball and continue talking about her life. A must buy for all Lucille Ball fans."
2,Doesn't stand up well,I have several ball books. I got this one because it is supposed to stand up. I thought it would be good for my clients to be hands free while trying to remember the exercises they learned. The information and instruction is good but it falls down and is hard to get it to stand like it is supposed to. All of the exercises can be found in similar books. Don't pay extra for this one. You'll only get distracted by trying to get it to stand up. Get or make a small tripod for your regular books. It works better.
5,Wonderful,I've found the essentials of golf to be incredibly useful. I've played a few rounds of golf but never had the proper education of course etiquette. The DVD helped me understand the actual game of golf much more. The format is great because I was able to skip over the few things that I already do know. I think this would be great for any golfer and especially anyone that is new to the game. I highly recommended this DVD for anyone that steps on a golf course.
2,"cheap, tacky","The picture is much better. It's cheap cloth and looks tacky with the chair I bought elsewhere long ago (it is retired from Crate and Barrel otherwise I would have purchased the ottoman but by the time I could afford it, it was discontinued). Anyhow, it looks poor next to the chair and it is very cheap cloth and poor quality wooden legs. The item arrived with black stains that were hard to clean and I'm just now almost getting rid of those stains. It'll do, but it's just old looking next to contemporary items in the room."
1,"Needs better description: Carolina Cottage Upholstered Oxford Ottoman, Beige","Just looking at the picture is appealing; reading what purchasers have reported is helpful. What about an accurate, written description of the item, eBay style, with measurements, description of the upholstery fabric, cleaning instructions, whether it has any other features that are not shown in the pictures,like storage, tray top, etc. That is a weakness of many items on Amazon. The site describes books VERY well, other items, not so well. HELP!!!!"
3,Too theoretical,This textbook was used in a graduate school course about open source software. It is too theoretical and does not cover specific software processes in OSS.
3,Perfect for a beginner,"I am an advanced player who has been training everyday for several years. This is an excellent overview of tennis. It does not get very detailed into anything, but it covers everything. What do I mean? For example, when it talks about forehand, it shows you basically how to hit it but doesnt include much more information like about open stance, semi-open stance, hip rotation, etc. It does include the very basic information. It also gives you information about the pro tour, how the tournaments work, and grand slams. I also like a few creative pages of information like ""a day in the life of a pro"" and ""mommy, where do pros come from?"" I recommend it for any beginner to intermediate player and it could even add one or two tips to the knowledge of the advanced player (afterall, no one knows everything!)."
2,Too many errors,"I was quite confused by this book which supposed to be simple. Later on I realized some part of the book is wrong.e.g. The picture of the ad/deuce side of the court is exactly the opposite, although some text to describe them in later chapter seems to be correct.The description of grips is even more confusing. I don't understand, why can't the book just simply mark it on the racquet and your hand? Is that so hard to do?I don't know whether the author made those mistakes or the printer just mis-printed them, but after reading this book, I had to do a lot of research on line to finally get the basic rules."
3,Britney Spears read this book,Britney Spears was pictured reading this book poolside whilst staying at an hotel in Miami at the beginning of April 2004.
1,wigwam...,"Maybe a little too simple. But then who doesn't want to believe in the magic lantern, mother goose, brothers grimm, and the occasional flying table cloth? I know I do!"
5,Classic,"Have you ever noticed how everytime you read a review on amazon everyone gives the album 5 stars and the average ratings always like 4 and a half. Thats cuz no ones gonna take the time to find an album and write a review unless they're a fan or or the album is so bad they have to warn everyone else not to buy it. This cd is definatly worth 5 stars no questions, buy it you wont regret it. Look out for Pimp c's artists lil boosie and webbie cuz they're tyte too."
5,One of the All-Time Best,"I have been listening to this album time and again since it was released (7 years ago). It is one of the most re-playable, most well rounded, sincere hip-hop efforts ever to be released. I have never understood why UGK hasn't blown up, in a time of mostly weak releases they released this masterpiece, and it still plays true today. Every song is listenable, and several could compete as singles even today (Pinky Ring, Diamonds and Wood, Hi-Life, Ridin' Dirty - and One Day is one of the best hip-hop tracks ever produced).Out of the hundreds of hip-hop albums I have, this is still strong in my top-ten. A must buy."
5,Ridin' Dirty is one of the best CD's ever,UGK's Ridin Dirty is a great production. Pimp C has the best southern voice in all of rap. Bun B's flows are tight. The beats are crisp with bangin' bump to em'. Try to get yo hands on any UGK product cuz they are all phat
4,FREE C-MURDER,I'm just f***in wit yal.If you kno real southern sh*t. I recommend this cd to anyone who kno tha GUSH of UGK when they hear it so get this sh*t if you down wit da trill.
5,UGK - Ridin' Dirty......14 years later,"Exactly 14 years on this day records stores across the country put a CD on the shelf that changed and set the tone for hip hop and music in general if you ask me. Ridin' Dirty was that album. Years previous before this album dropped, I argued that The Chronic was the best album front to back until this one dropped. Not to take anything from The Chronic, but this one split it's fair share of speakers. Pimp C himself said something to the effect that he wanted to make an album on that level and be in the zone Dr. Dre was in.I can damn near rap to this whole cd but the tracks that stand out the most to me is the following:MurderDiamonds & Wood3 in the Mornin'TouchedThat's Why I CarryHi LifeOutroSo what I plan on doing is playing this one off and on throughout this weekend as I ride through this city called Houston and pay homage to 2 of my favorite rappers; Pimp C (RIP) and Bun B."
5,Wow,"This CD is really intense, that is, if you're a fan of amazing thrash metal. Unlike most thrash metal, there are so many varying elements that keep the music switched up, yet in a constant state of high gear at the same time. For example, the drumwork - though staying somewhere inside a generic pace of the music, vary's unline most thrash metal drumwork. Slow down's, speed up's... all of it. The vocals are a little bit strange to get used to, but once you get completely in key of the vocalist, you won't be able to put this album down. The guitar work is somewhat generic, but very technical, and quite fast, 2 things that are a little hard to merge into one band. The bass is mixed pretty well for being a 1989 release (which happens to be my birthdate). All in all, you're looking at an amazingly original, and a highly entertaning thrash metal release. BUY IT!!"
4,ok,"not really sure, i bought them as a gift for my mother, and i don't think that she uses them....... i think that she is afraid they might slip out from under her chair. SO...... as far as i know, they could be really great!"
2,Facile and no help,This book is superficial and contains little help about spirituality in retirement. In our six-member reading group not one person derived significant learning from the book.
4,"""The Man Who Painted Roses"" - A great story of a great painter","Even 170 years on, Pierre-Joseph Redouté's works are so outstanding they almost don't need his signature. This biography dates to 1974, and is written in (what is certainly now) an old-fashioned style, which I nevertheless enjoyed immensely - for its personable/provincial quality."
2,Too expensive for a book of this size.,"I have already returned this book. This book cost me about $38 to buy (with S&H), and $11 to return for shipping and handling. This book is too expensive for a book of this meager size. I could have easily gotten a similar book for only $20. The illustration is nice but I guess I was expecting more detailed stories (given its price) like Barnes & Nobles' collectors edition for fairy tales."
3,Not really all that bad..,"Like the name says, this book is for beginning dutch students who want to advance to the next level. I never bought colloquial dutch 1 so I cant really say what its advancing from, but from going from the ""Teach Yourself Dutch Series"" (which i would not recommend at all) to this series has been a great improvement. This series is of course, for those who want to improve their beginners dutch. Don't expect any frills or fun activities- its purely textbook-like. I have no problem learning the new vocabulary and grammar but thats because im already familiar with most of it. I suggest perhaps going through two different beginners dutch series and then work your way through this book. I really like how i can easily navigate where i'm at in the book and what the objectives of the lesson are. I wanted to buy the rossetta stone series but they are outrageously high, so no hope there. For its price, id say its a pretty good bargain."
1,An Insult to Our Youth,"If this book is an example of what ""Young Adult"" readers think is good (see the high marks by Rebecca), I would be insulted. I think young readers of science fiction are more likely to have limitations of attention span than a need to identify with shallow characters and weak plots. I could (and have!) re-read classic ""youth"" fiction from Heinlein like Podykane of Mars, Starman Jones, and Citizen of the Galaxy as an adult and they still entertain. For other readers to review it poorly, then say it would be great for youthful readers, is unfair to our youth."
5,Jeff and Sheri are AWESOME,"Jeff and Sheri Easter are as good as music gets. All of their CDs are worth buying. If you've never heard them, you are missing out more than you know. I recommend that you buy this CD right now. Every single song on this CD is an awesome song. One of the songs, ""Praise His Name,"" has climbed to the top of several southern gospel music charts. It is currently #2 on the Singing News Top 80 Charts."
5,Terrific Music,Great listening. Jeff and Sheri did it again. What a great CD. Love the music. Can't do much better than this.
1,Too Short for my Troy Bilt Tiller,"These are advertised all over the internet to be 22 1/4 inch, and will fit a Troy-Bilt horse tiller. When I got them, they are marked 4L220, which means 22 inches, and they also measure 22 inches, this is too short for my troy-bilt tiller."
4,Leather Carry Case,This case is great. It is lightweight; the window is clear and I feel secure with my phone in it. It would have been better if it did not have the plastic clip but a leather clip instead to cut down on the bulkness.
1,Poor asian quality. Not worth 10cents,"Very sad. Bushnell is a big brand. It's a shame that they would put thier name on such a crappy product.As you will read with other reviews, the threads on the bolt that screws into the binoculars is so poorly made you barely get 1/4 turn before it binds up.These are absolutely 100% useless. I was on the phone within 5 minutes arranging for the refund/return back to Amazon."
2,Does not fit securely,"The threads only go in a couple of turns on both of the Bushnell binoculars I own, the Bushnell Perma Focus 12x50 Wide Angle Binocular, and the Bushnell PowerView 20x50 Super High-Powered Surveillance Binoculars. This leave a lot of wiggle room for the binoculars to pivot from side to side. I suppose you could put some sort of a spacer or several washers in between so you could keep the connection tight."
1,junk,"sounds to me from reading all the reviews that Bushnell China does not have any inspectors on the payroll just a couple guys running around cutting threads on these adapters with hacksaws and old rusty files......maybe they need to get them done here in the good old USA where they will be done correctly. I'd pay more to have a great product and put an American Citizen to work...and I mean Citizen, not a Green Card Holder................."
4,Bushnell Binocular Tripod Adaptor,Item exactly as shown and received quickly. Pleasantly surprised to find the female camera screw on the bottom and would have ordered a monopod at the same time if I had of known.
1,Bushnell Tripod Adapter,"Poorly designed - won't securely fasten to binoculars - have to remove it to get binoculars back into case. Get yourself a Giottos Ball Head adapter instead - works perfectly - and a couple of bucks cheaper. Would return this Bushnell thing, but I have found another use for it. Nothing against Bushnell binoculars - have a couple of pair - and they are terrific."
1,Why I don't like buying items through the internet.,"Even though the companies involved said their computers verified that this was the right part, the part didn't fit and their was no explanation why. I will now return the product dissaticfied and out the cost of shipping and handling."
4,Better than a Mike Piazza Grand Slam,"Awesome!! These guys continue to put out amazing stuff. You will never see these guys on MTV, but who cares, they never let me down.This cd has some classic good old fashioned FUN Rock and Roll. I think that is what is missing in alot of today's music. Everyone seems to be concerned with sales, videos and the bottom line. Music is supposed to be fun. This CD is a whole lotta fun...Thanks to the boys for putting this one out after such a long wait...."
5,The Outfield hit another home run!!,"This CD rocks! The songs are energetic, soulful, and satisfying. Filled with catchy hooks, high harmonies and fun lyrics. Tony Lewis' voice sounds amazing, just the same as it did on their first hit, ""Your Love""....John Spinks' writing style delivers the goods. Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed!! And ENJOY!!"
3,Nice Catch,"Okay, there are a few real good songs on here that I like, (""Heaven's Little Angel,"" ""Lay Down,"" ""Girl Of Mine,"") and more than a few that would not go on my all time favorites Outfield collection. I was pleased however that these guys are still fairly true to themselves, writing and producing the songs that are heard here. My only real complaint would be the drums. I don't mean the drummer! Simon Dawson is a great drummer, but the production here has his work muddled andmuted with too much synth thrown in. It throws the whole album off for me. Still, not bad, and, worth it, if you are an Outfield fan."
4,Some fresh songs that have taken to long to release,I have been an Outfield fan since 1985...this is the best new material to come out since Voices of Babylon...My only problem with the album is that we had to wait too long to hear some original music from the boys of summer...Very good album.
4,A Different Touch,"My wife read this book first and was mildly disappointed with it. Armed with lower expectations by her comments; I started reading the book not expecting too much, and to my pleased surprise, I found it to be a delightful collection of individual tales loosely connected by the travels of the ""Fairy Caravan"". After reading the tale about the ""elephant"" sneezing, and blowing its trunk across the barnyard, I could not look at the cover art which shows the ""elephant"" without laughing at the memory of that sneeze.If one determines to approach the book without prejudice, it offers some delightful stories. On balance, I'm glad I took the time to read it. The book seemed to have a special place in the heart of Mrs. William Heelis (aka Beatrix Potter) who is mentioned as a character in the book; I believe I can see why.I enjoyed the book and can recommend it to fans of Beatrix Potter."
2,What I ordered is not what arrived,"I ordered this text book, for what I thought was a good price. What I got was the ""International Addition"" which is not the same book. The packing slip said it was only different by the cover, which at first seemed fine for me, but it turns out the cover has all the ""cheater charts"" for quick reference. I haven't found those in this version of the book yet.It was a total bait and switch. They advertise a specific book, tell you that is what you are ordering, then mail you something else. I don't think having the International addition will make or break me passing the class, but it wasn't what I agreed to ordering."
2,Kindle version - missing needed tables in appendix,"This was my first kindle textbook purchase and likely my last.I knew having an electronic textbook was going to be challenging but since my professor required the brand new edition, I couldn't find anything used on half, ebay or anything else. Being a poor college student, I chose the cost efficient route and I paid for it. A few of the tables in the appendix are covered and show, ""Text not available due to copyright restriction."" If I had known that I would certainly not have gone this route.Classmates bought the international version and it is exactly the same besides the cover and softcover rather than hard for about the same price as the electronic version here."
2,"a cheat and a scoundral what a life, what a story",The play goes along very similar lines as that of the shakespear play measure for measure as both show selfabsorbtion is a paramount factor though it does seem like a rewrite is does has its own high points especially Mosca a very funny character.
5,"Paco de Lucia - ""Fuente y Caudal""",Paco de Lucia is one of the finest flamenco guitarists in the world. This album accurately captures the passion and sensuality of the flamenco genre. It is impossible to sit still while listening to this music. One is drawn to stand and attempt to dance the flamenco.
4,Among the greats of Shoah literature.,"If you want another aspect of the Shoah, this is the book to read. Somehow, Borowski manages to write about the unthinkable in a totally everyday way. What is it to have your concious being, your limits defined in a concentration camp? How is it to live day to day without hope amongst the unthinkable? Along with David Watt's ""Stoker"",and Martin Gilbert's amazing academic work this is a must read for student's of the Halocaust. But be warned, no wonder Borowki committed suicide. A brilliant piece of writing,"
4,Just what I expected...,"Don't get me wrong, any help with the title department for my pages and my cards is appreciated. I was afraid that this book would be filled with ""hokey"" sayings. When I received this book yesterday, I looked through it and found just what I had expected. Yes, it's nice to have all of the sayings in one book. But they are mostly predictable or already heard of.This could be because this is the first edition of this series. I will continue to collect these books because I do feel they are an asset."
2,no software support,"This is for the Kindle edition. The book is well done, the lessons are clear and easy to understand. The problem is that to complete the lessons in the book you need software thats not avalible in the web page indicaded in the text. The price is to much, over 50 dollars Kindle. I have even send an email to the addrees supplied and no answer.Do not buy"
5,Progressive Jazz Organ Soul,"Stretching beyond standards, blues and boogaloo, this album digs into a deep groove. Fans of Roland Kirk, John Coletrane and Larry Young will appreciate it just as much as all those Blue Note groove albums of the late '60s. The solos are heavy and deep, yet the album is highly danceable and lot's of surprizes. Highly innovative. - - Sadly, few Jazz organists have followed up on BJPs soulful yet experimental approach. Some have gone ""way out"" (Jeff Palmer, Medeski, Novello), but the challenge here is going way out, yet sticking to your groove and grits. If you like this, BLUES FOR LOU is a must and check out BILL HEID's WET STREETs or BOP RASCAL. Memorable listening, the album will grow on you."
1,"Sorry John, not even close......","This album is bad. Sorry John. I'm not familiar with Mr Zorn's other work, but he is a terrible saxophonist in this setting. He just ain't got the funk. In fact his funkiness rating is a negative number. If someone asks you to define ""whiteness"" as it applies to the sax, this CD might come in handy. Just make sure to store it away from the rest of your collection in case it sucks the truth out of the music. Fans of big John will know this, but, check out Lou Donaldson, or Harold Alexander for technique and (more importantly) soul."
2,look out here comes another one,"okay the good thing about the album is that a few tracks are good for dancing too. on the other hand how many of these bands are we going to see in our lifetime. i doubt seriously they wrote all of their songs. its just another band some record producer invented to make money off teenage girls.if you bought this album dont bother buying anything from nsync 98 degrees or any other bsb albums their all basically the same, come on people this is not real music"
1,TO: a music fan,BSB rocks the house?????? lol wtf are you thinking saying that! Please....drag yourself out of the 90's and hit puberty...please!!! lol....never...EVER say that again....never ever
1,A new low for teenage music.,This is the worst cd ever! Don't buy an alblum that has no musical worth. This is just another coaster for a coffee table. John Lennon must be spinning in his grave.
1,Awful!!!,"This cd was a total waste of my time! The songs all sound alike, and they are not even half good!!! They don't even write there own songs! Look on the cd jacket!! Who do these guys think they're kidding? Babies?"
3,A group for today but not for posterity,"Wasn't this album available in the States then? That is suprising to say the least, as it was all over Canada. The BSB's were kinda the start of the commercially put together boy band craze. At least, since this album came out, it seems that every guy and his brother want to be in a boy band. Even though nearly every guy will profess that they hate the BSB's and all boy bands. However, I must admit that the songs are catchy and danceable, and on the whole, harmless fun. But certainly nothing that will last for generations. A hundred years from now, heck..50 years from now, they will be forgotten along with Britney, but for now, they are here, so enjoy while you can."
1,bsb stinks,don't spend you're money on bsb get a band that acuttally writes there songs. i would give them a 0 for stars but they don't have it. just don't by it man
1,I loved it,"Just joking. This CD sounds like a fart. If you buy it, you will smell like a fart. Getting the hint?"
2,AAAAAAAAAARGH! HORRORS!,"These guys debuted with this silly little period piece, different from ""Backstreet's Back,"" their second official album, in 1997. This led to numerous teen pop artists, like Britney Spears, who release albums that go diamond! What in the world is going on here?I think these Backstreet Brats should get it going on with Andrea Bocelli, a tenor from Italy who does know how to sing, which I very much doubt they will."
1,WOW ! WHAT A BAD ALBUM!,"It's amazing how these guys keep fooling people. I ask you: do they write their songs? Or some clever professional songwriter do that for them? I have absolutely nothing against ballads and pop, but when that sounds a complete fake, that pisses me off!"
1,"Why Isn't There A Zero-Star Rating?.... (Please God, Why?!)","Hehe, This Sux So Much. (...) I Just Don't Understand why Theywould not put a zero-star rating."
5,THE BACKSTREET BOYS RULE!!!!,"WHO CAN FORGET THIS GROUP THAT CAME BY STORM IN THE '90s. THIS GROUP SHOWED THAT THEY CAN SING, DANCE AND PUT UP A GREAT SHOW, WHOEVER WENT TO THEIR CONCERT KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THEY WHERE AMAZING. LISTENING TO THIS CD, BRING BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES AND TO THIS DAY I LISTEN TO IT, IT PUT YOU IN A GOOD MOOD. ALSO TRY THE SPECIAL EDITION OF THIS CD, ""BACKSTREET'S BACK"",(I GOT IT ON EBAY) ITS ALMOST LIKE THIS ONE BUT IT HAS LIKE 3 RARE TRACKS ON IT, LIKE ""10,000 PROMISES"" I LOVE THAT SONG. I GOT THEM BOTH AND ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY. I REMEMBER HAVING POSTERS ALL OVER MY WALL WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, OH..AND MY FAVORITE BACKSTREET BOY, BRIAN LITRELL...SO KEEP THIS IN YOUR COLLECTION, ITS A GREAT CD..."
4,Good opener,"Well, I have to be honest. After hearing what the Backstreet Boys can do now, I can't give this disc a high rating. It is over produced, but some songs make up for it: ""As Long as You Love Me,"" ""Quit Playin Games,"" and ""All I Have to Give"" are the reasons for purchasing this CD. They carry it to a 4-star rating, as well as the cover of the old ""Set Adrift On Memories Bliss."" I would say, if you're a fan, you've got to have this, but if you aren't, you'll hate it. And this is coming from a devoted fan."
2,Kind of disappointing,"I was kind of disappointed with this album. I could only listen to it a couple times before all the songs suddenly sounded the same. Their music lacks creativity. They don't write their own songs, nor do they have much input. The Backstreet Boys are much too manufactured for me."
5,very good CD. Buy their new one too!,A great Cd. A mix of slow and fast music. All about the same topic-love. Why not? Pick it up and Millenium while your at it!
3,Ok,"It was kind of a boring CD, the only good song was Everybody (Backstreet's Back). I am not a mindless teenie-bopper-- I DO listen to other types of music--- Kid Rock,Jewel,Orgy,Savage Garden,Hole,Usher, Lauryn Hill,ect... But people some of the songs ARE stupidly sickening-- if you haven't yet noticed almost every song contains the word sex or sexual. Hmmm lovely things for your 8 year old kid sister to be listening to. So save your money and get Millenium-- the only better then ok bsb CD. Have I made my point ya'll?"
5,Great Music!,i love this CD! the songs are great and i love singing along with them. the backstreet boys have great voices and their harmonies are beautiful! i recommend this CD to every music fan!
2,"As Whitney Huston would say, ""It's not right, but it's okay""","Okay, I admit it. I, too, used to be a BSB fan. Everytime I saw one of their videos I would cry (how pathetic is that)?! Well, with the help of rock and roll I have managed to turn my life around. The fact is that none of these guys can sing well, with the exception of Kevin who seems to have been banned from singing on this album. The only talent that they deserve to be credited for is the fact that they can do what their managers tell them to do. But I must admit, those managers can be smart at times. The best song on here is ""Everybody."" ""As Long As You Love Me"" is okay too. If you are so down in the dumps that you can't stand it any longer, then this music is sickeningly happy and monotonus enough to put you in a better mood. Otherwise, leave this album alone and let it die in the graveyard of boy bands before them."
5,all their cds rock,"I don't have THIS cd, but I have the first cd, 2nd and 3rd which has all of the songs on this cd. This cd is amazing. It's not as good as millennium, though. If you like the sound of BSB, you'll love this. There are a mix of dance tunes and pop/r&b. Everybody should have this cd. I suggest getting the first cd, ""Backstreet Boys"", AND ""Backstreet's Back"", instead of this cd, if possible. This cd is just a mix of those two cds...but if you can get both cds do, cause there are other REALLY cool songs you'd be missing out on."
3,Decent pop CD,"This is a pretty good CD, although I like 'N Sync better. It's better than Millenium. All their singles are good and catchy (# 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8). I also like ""Hey Mr. DJ"". Some of the rest of the songs aren't so great, but overall, the album isn't bad. You'll like it if you like the other boybands."
4,Definitely good but old,"I love this cd. It really is great. You can surely tell though that it was a while ago. Nick sounds like he is about 5 in all the songs. Brian still has his sweet voice, though. I would definitely recommend it!"
1,Music? try waste of time,"Calling this stuff music is a travesty. Look at bands who really put their heart and soul into an album (i.e. Grant Lee Buffalo, Jeff Buckley, U2). I did not buy this album, but rather, borrowed it from a friend to find out if all their songs were as bad as the ones on the radio. Yup, they sure are. Spend your money wisely people."
5,THIS CD RULES!!!,"this cd is so awesome. me and my friends love it.i think they all are really h-o-t-t hot. A.J. is da bomb. i love all the songs on this cd and normally that doesn't happen. well, i would tell everyone go get this one or there new one. thanxs.."
1,This is considered music???????????????????,"This type of junk will continue to sell until the teenage girls outgrow it. Calling this music is like calling spam meat. It just ain't. If you hate it like me, they will be gone soon. (New Kids on the Block, where are they now?????????????)"
4,My Fav' Stars,"Yep, Backstreet Boys have ever remained my Fav' Stars since their singing debut 'Quit playing Games with my heart' and Everybody...Rock your body'. Millennium proved to be the Best Hit Pick in my List and sure, sure, Backstreet Boys CD is a prize collection in the closet. Brian is cool, so is Nick n rest and this is one group one can't resist to listen to their catchy, sweet ballads n dance numbers. Quit playing games and As long as you love me are great numbers. Hey Mr. DJ is a song to hum n hope it keeps playing along. If you wanna be a good girl, get a bad boy is sweet lyrics coz makes me smile at the words and is a pretty number smartly conveying the message. All I have to give is a nice ballad singing blues of a girlfriends tears. I'll never break your Heart is an emotion through lyrics. The group is a unique togetherness and has topped the charts with their 'Larger than Life'. Great Pick if you like the Pop n Ballad n Cool Listen. My choice - Enjoy!"
2,My first mistake,"Let's be forward, who really doesn't think they are good-looking? I mean, they are. And they can sing. They aren't pulling some Milli Vanilli thing. So, I saw the videos for ""Quit Playing Games With My Heart"" and ""Everybody"" and so I bought the CD thinking it was going to be REALLY good because of how good and original those tracks were. I must say it's a GREAT deal better than some of the boy band stuff out there now, but it's still practically 12 of the same damn songs. There's hardly any differential matterial on it."
1,My Head Hurts,To think they call this music is disturbing. I am in the generation that likes this. No wonder adults think were in trouble. This album is the decay of youth culture as we know it.
5,I love this album!!,This cd is great. The songs are so catchy. I love it. Every song IS SO AWESOME!!
3,i'll be blunt!if you want a boring CD to add to your...,"collection,buy this.Yes aside from the hits here theres some not so good stuff.The hits and high points would have to be Quit playing games,As long as you love me,everybody and all i have to give.The low point would definatly have to be the dreamy and horrific remake of PM Dawns ""Set adrift on memory bliss"" and the closing song-""if you want it to be good girl (get yourself a bad boy)"".Theres a number of tracks that are good but theres also a good share of dissapointing songs.The production is slick, the tunes are cheap pop beats and the lyrics are average with few moving songs. Yes admittingly, better than'N SYNC, but this album not by much."
2,From what I heard...ugh,"Well,I was just about to get this CD, until I looked at some of the comments. Bad lyrics? I've never known Backstreet for that. Yea,sure,there's more songs I like on this album, but I think my mom would prefer me to get Milleniumn..."
3,Decent debut,"It seems that BSB did great at first but some songs were a bit too slow or mellow for me on this album. Millennium is my personal favorite by BSB for some reason. *N Sync were the ones with the awesome debut. Decent but not great. We all know the same stuff.... That none play instruments, they've mainly got dancing talent(because recently they haven't hit their high notes that great) and they've sold out Burger King. It's a bit old, but not bad. It gets that way with all boy bands in which my favorite is BB Mak."
2,How bad is this cd? VERY!,"This CD is horrible. I used to like the Backstreet Boys (and I still do sometimes), but this is absolutely the worst CD I've ever heard by them. The only good songs are the ones that have been released as singles and maybe a couple of other ones. It's all hyper and drummed out. Every song sounds different, but sometimes it's in a bad way. If you're a diehard BSB fan, you MIGHT like this. If you're not that big of a fan, STAY AWAY! It would be horrible for this cd to turn you off to pop music."
5,N'sync's Rival,"This CD is my 2th BSB CD. It's real good, one day I just kept playin' it and I got interested in ""Hey mister DJ(Keep playin' that song)"". If you don't have it, Dang you!"
1,How can you listen to this group?,"If you like Backstreet Boys, there is something wrong with you. E-,ail me if you do at pat_hickey@lycos.com . I would like to argue with anybody who likes them, so email me telling me that you like them. If you don't I am convinced that the world is rid of Backstreet Boys forever because they don't make music, they are just horrible."
5,the debut that started it all,"This is the European version of the Backstreet Boys' debut. I think this version is better than the US version `cause of the other tracks. The hits are here too. Songs like ""we've got it goin' on"", ""get down (you're the one for me)"", ""I'll never break your heart"", and ""quit playing games (with my heart)"" are all BSB classics.Included with those hits are other great songs like ""just to be close to you"", ""every time I close my eyes"", ""darlin'"" and ""roll with it."" As a whole BSB's original self-titled debut is awesome. It's the boys at their most poppy. They also have great harmonies (as usual). I was first introduced to BSB with this CD and it's still one of my all time faves today. This CD was originally released in Europe and Canada way back in 1996. I suggest you get this version even If you have the others."
5,THE BEST CD I`VE HEARD!!,THIS IS FOR ANY TRUE BACKSTREET BOY FAN.I LOVE THEIR MUSIC AND IT JUST HELPS THAT THEY HAVE BIG HEARTS AND ARE REALLY HOT. ANYWAYS BEFORE I WROTE THIS I TRYED YO THINK WHAT WAS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS CD AND I HAVE TO SAY ALL OF THEM!!
3,It's OK,"I love the Backstreet Boys, but their new CD ""Millenium"" is much better than the original. There are some good songs on it, but most of them are generic."
5,they hit it again.. and again!!,"okay, so millenium's out now, but don't forget the precious album that hit it for those backstreet babes!!! this album is full of love [ try about every song!], energy [ that's the way i like it [ # 4] ], and verything you want. personal fav's : hey mr. dj and 10 thousand promises. this is their best album, well, that's what i think, so buy it!! but then again, everyone on the face of the planet already own's it, so listen to it again... and again!!"
1,A packaged deal by the record company.,"Where is the talent? Only a few of them actually have decent voices, no one is a standout with a great voice. The songs are all the same, lacking a variety of subject matter and any real expression lyrically. The music itself takes few chances and appears to be a lot of keyboard and synth programing. In the tradition of vocal bands they fall very low on the list in terms of talent. The Beach Boys, The Clancy Brothers, The Platters, The Coasters, The Kingston Trio, The Brothers Four, etc. One could go on and on. As far as R&B vocal groups are concerned, take any motown group and they stand far above the Backstreet Boys. Take Six is an excellent acapella band which goes to town all over the Backstreet Boys. Overall, they are breaking no new ground musically and they do not even stand up well against groups within their genre. A total bore."
5,This is great!,When you listen to this CD you will faint its so good! This CD is amazing! Backstreet boys rule!
4,So What If They're Pop...,"I got Backstreet's debut album a couple years after it came out, but I still thought it was pretty good. ""Quit Playing Games"", ""As Long"", ""All I Have"", ""Everybody"", and ""Never Break"" are all enough to make you want to buy this album. Although BSB is adored by millions of pre-teen girls, you shouldn't totally dismiss this album. However, this is their first album and they have gotten much better over the years. I never understood how this music is considered ""pop"" when all it is R&B. But that's all a part of a critic's job- to neatly place everyone in a particular musical category."
4,Its Good enough,"Well this CD is a nice compilation of BSB songs, and specially the Enhanced Feature is quite impressive, like interviews, movie clips etc"
3,Half and Half,"I got this CD, expecting to be blown away, and was disappointed. Although there are some good points like ""All I Have to Give"", ""I'll never break your heart"", and ""Quit Playing Games""; the other songs like ""Set Adrift"", and ""If you Want It Good"" come off as way over-produced and sappy."
1,"poorly written lyrics, lacking capability","I have to admit that I once owned this album. Going to a teeny-bopper dominated middle school I did it to be cool and fit in. I tried listening to the music but I found none of the songs interested me or were good. So of course I sold the album to a resale disc store. For all of you Backstreet Boys lovers- I'm not trying to trash you but there is so much better music out there. These songs lack intellect, good lyrics, and variety. All the BSB do is sing about the same thing (love) in a corny unattractive way. Good CD's contain songs that grab the listener realistically and are more substantially based than telling about the same heart-breaks with the same words, over and over again. Sorry, BSB, but despite some of your ratings you aren't even worthy of being on my list..."
1,this CD is so shallow and meaningless,"can you believe that a band like this could top a chart? I hate their shallow teenybop style and the fact that their soppy meaningless lyrics get played and replayed on commercial crap radio day in day out.no matter how pathetic and gay the lead singers look, commercial marketing has its way and ""music"" fans world wide go all hormonal over them and that is the only reason that anyone buys their CD at all ."
1,What a horrible album,"This is total trash, anyone who isn't a girl or over 17 should agree. This isn't man made music, it's just like rap, it's made by a machine. These guys aren't even a group they were put together by a corporation based on looks and blending vocals. They are a bunch of sissies without any style to call there own, any real music tallent besides vocals ability, and they have not attitude as well. They only things these guys say are what the record companies tell them to, they don't even write their own songs, they just improvise and let professionals pen their predictable and one dimensional lyrics."
1,Nothing compared to Insync and LFI!!,I listedned too this C.D. n hated it. In Insync's latest masterpece u could feel the emotion. LFI has some catchy songs. BSB are real losy!
3,I feel like I'm re-writing my Hanson review.,"Um. . . it was okay. Sure the songs they released are pretty good, but for the most part, the music all sounds the same. It's almost like they just took the same song and replaced the lyrics, and BOOM, there's an alubm. I like most pop music, even NSYNC, but I really don't have a taste for this. If you don't have the album, just buy one of the singles. You'll be getting the same stuff for half the price. Oh, and"
4,"Nice Interest in the BSB for Me, a Non-Teen Music Fan",I became interested in these hot young guys as soon as I listened to some songs from this album. Now I practically know why these guys are a world sensation. A.J. and Howie D. are very hermoso!
1,bsb sucks!!!,"bsb boys are the worst band in the universe!! those oof you who like them, are u gay?? check out nsync instead!!!! backstreet boys suck!!!! nsync is better, alot better!!!! MICHELE M."
1,Please say there is something lower than one star~,wow. I never knew that Bsb could be that bad. I feel like I must give them something just because I feel sorry for them. Bsb is making fools of them selfs. It's awful! Some one stop them from ruining the music industry! Stop! Oh no! People are getting ruined and brain washed from there awful music! There has to be a warning sign.WARNING: THIS CD WILL CAUSE SOME SIDE EFFICTS. YOU MUGHT BE SENSTIVE TO SUNLIGHT. YOUR EARS WILL START TO HURT. YOU WILL GO OUT AT NIGHT AND SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOME MUSIC SENSE!They really should label that out. In big print. Sorry BSB you guys had you'r 15 minute of fame. So just step aside and let Nsync take care of all the damage that you have done. I rest my case.
5,The best cd I've ever listened to!!,"I buy many cds and for most cds there are only a couple of songs on there that I actually like. But with the Backstreet Boys cd, I love all of the songs on the album. I never have to skip over any of the songs cuz I enjoy the entire cd!! These guys are really talented and I can't wait until their new cd ""Millenium"" comes out!"
1,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Why, WHY does the music industry have to be this way?! I miss the 60's music that was actually good! This is complete garbage. WHO CAN POSSIBLY LIKE THIS SLOP?!? People who have no taste in music, that's for certian. Cute?! My dogs are betting looking than these guys(and are more fashionally coordinated.) Please, make these guys go working in a fast food place asking people if they want fries with that an buy Phil Collins, Genesis, Eric Clapton and people who actually have talent! Please, these guys can't sing to save their lives."
5,Great CD I love all the songs,"This cd is the first classic of this group. I love As Long As You Love me, but Quit playing games with my heart was the reason i feel in love with this group:)> I recommend it to anyone who is a fan to get this album right away. You wont be dissapointed.LISA"
3,This CD is OK.,"I have this CD but I am not playing it that often. In fact this album is sitting on my shelf for weeks or months on end. My U2, Depeche Mode, and Enya CDs are getting a lot of spins. As Long As You Love me, and Everybody are good in my opinion. I do enjoy the Halloween video for Everybody. It was one of the best videos I had seen in a long time back then in 1997. Meanwhile songs like Hey Mr. DJ, a cover version of Set Adrift On Memory, and If You Want to Be Good Girl are just plain awful to the point to being almost unlistenable. The rest are ok. The music on here is very teen oriented with some blue-eyed soul influences.I,m not very fond of this CD. Not that I call it bad but just so many other CDs I have get many time more spins in my CD player.Backstreet Boys would improve dramatically on their Millennium album two years after this one but would come crashing to the ground with the oh so boring Black and Blue."
5,I thought this C.D was a 5 star C.D,"I think this C.D is one of besy c.d's this year. my favorit song is ""All I Hace To Give"" and i love nick carter"
5,One of a kind,The Backstreet Boys burst onto the scene with Quit Playing Games and have been pumpin ever since. Their blend of soulfulness and sexuality make them a group well worth keeping your ears and eyes on. Watch for their latest cd in stores May 18 to see just how much they have evolved.
1,If I could I'd give it 0 stars!!!,"Repulsive and nauseating! This cd is filled with those annoying pop songs that all sound alike and stay in your head for years to come. Fulll of cheesy ""love songs"" and irritating dance ""music"", I hope this cd is banned from the U.S. Backstreet Boys are like all the other ""boy bands"": slightly attractive teenagers who sing songs whose meanings soar over their heads in revolting nasal ""voices""."
1,NO STARS VERY BORING,I FOUND THIS ALBUM AND THIS TYPE OF MUSIC VERY UNINSPIRING. IT IS SAD THAT THIS TYPE OF MUSIC DOMINATES THE AIR WAVES. WE HAVE TO GET REAL ROCK AND ROLL BANDS MUST RULES THE AIRWAVES!
1,The Backstreet boys are just another generic boy band,"The offering of the hideously incapable Backstreet boys which they call ""Backstreet Boys"" (how creative)is nothing more than cheesy Dance tunes and love songs. Does our society really want these teen idol poseurs influencing our young girls? They thrive on the adoration of thousands of female fans who like them for nothing more than their so-called ""good looks"". They have no musical talent whatsoever and by calling them a band you do a horrible injustice to those groups out there wjo are real bands and don't just sing the songs that others write for them."
5,Great Music,This Cd is the greatest cd that I have ever bought they are great singers and they deserve 5 starsCongradulations BSB you've got my vote
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"I love this c.d. and I love the Millenium c.d. also. Both are so exciting to listen to!! I like Nick Carter the most because I think (MY OPINION) he has the best voice. If you're feeling down, don't be afraid to listen to this music!!!!!!!!!!!!!-katie"
4,Great Music!,"This CD is just GREAT! I really like the way they all sings together. Since I'm a singer myself (Seriously,.......not kidding.....although I don't have any Albums.....), I can really feel the mood in their music. My favorites were ""I'll Never Break Your Heart"" and ""Anything For You""."
5,Best boy band-dance cd debut ever,"The sound of the band has developed since this album hit the streets, but I still think that this is as good as it gets in this music-category. Every song has feeling, which makes the WHOLE album worth listening to many times. In the days of the release of the album, the sound and drive that this album delivered was still unknown, so in my eyes (and ears) this album brought us a small sound-revolution in dance-music. And people can scream and yell that these guys aren't real musicians and so on, but the songs are still fantastic!"
3,"""Milennium"" is a big improvement on this!","This cd is okay, since it's by the Backstreet Boys, but the ending tracks have no tune and the boys weren't at their best. The new ""Milennium"" is so much better!"
3,DID SOMETHING WRONG,BACKSTREET BOYS WAS OK FOR THE FIRST ALBUM BUT IT DID NOT MAKE THE CUT FOR ME IT'S THERE FIRST ALBUM THEY EVER HAD AND I'D GIVE THEM CREDIT BUT IT WAS ONLY OK!
1,Very Flat,Talent-Less in every sense of the word.The music is Dated New Jack&The vocals are plain boring.all of their music is Formula.Avoid at all costs.just like all the other boy bands.
1,Not even real musicians,"the backstreet boys are not real musicians in any sense of the word. they don't have the intelligence or the talent to write their own songs or play their own instruments. they use their looks to sell their records. if you were to ask anyone why they like their music, they would say because they're so hot. i made the mistake of buying this and now i can't get rid of it!"
1,Another pop disappoinment.,"Personally, I do not understand the appeal of the Backstreet Boys. I do not want to listen to guys singing to each other about how sexual the other is (Everybody). There are a hundred other groups out there exactly like these guys, N'Sync and 98 degrees to name a couple. Where's the originality?? And what's with the sudden explosion of teenage, all guy, pseudo-seductive group clones? The lyrics could have been written by my ten year old brother. Part of a good song is how lyric the lyrics are, and how the lyrics complement the music and vice versa. The Backstreet Boys may as well be humming. Simply put, this music is fluff. If you like, go ahead and stuff yourself with the""Boys"".I prefer something a little less...disappointing."
3,Didn't have all the songs on it.,"I was hoping to get the one that had (everybody) backstreets back on it because I am building up a 90ies collection. I know that they added it as a bonus song later, so be careful what cd you buy."
4,TRUE TALENT!,"Back in 1995, when I was in 7th grade, I saw these guys perform in my middle school lunch room before anyone knew who they were. They had those little pre-teen girls soaking wet. The blond haired kid hit piercingly high notes. I was completely baffled by this as I sat back and ate my cream corn and mini corn dogs. So I bought the cassette tape. Then the ladies were all talking to me. They were like, ""Hey Chad, can I listen to the B-Boys on your headphones?"" And I was like ""Ah yeah baby, come over here and sit on my lap, and we can listen to the sweat sounds of the B-Boys together."" He he he he he. Backstreet's back, alright!"
1,sucks,Backstreet boys are a bunch of f aggots who sing about nothing but girls #$%^ing them over and all kinds of boring sh it save your money
3,Could be better...,"I don't know. I listen to bands like cKy and SR-71, but I'm going to try and make this as non-biased as possible. This CD would be good if not for songs like ""We've Got It Goin' On"" and ""Everybody"". Those songs are just annoying. Some songs are good, like ""Anywhere for you"". I used to listen to BSB back in like 4th and 5th grade, and really haven't listened to them since, because my taste in music changed. Overall the CD is okay... just not a masterpiece."
2,I feel nauseus...,"Personally I didn't like this CD. To be honest, I feel sickened to think about how so many girls are obsessed with these guys because of their looks. Some of them can sing, yes, but I have not met a single girl who likes the Backstreet Boys because of their voices. Okay, enough with that- on to the CD review. A couple of songs are okay, enough to give them 2 stars, but I just really wish that the radio would quit with most of their songs. If you like NSync (although as much as I am against pop music and teenyboppers, I think NSync does sing better), Britney Spears, and others like that, you'll probably enjoy this CD (or the CD cover)."
4,The album that started the boy band trend,"I still think that Backstreet Boys' US debut is still a solid pop debut. The Max Martin-dominated songs like Quit Playing Games, As Long as you Love Me and others are still superb pop songs. There are some funky numbers like Hey Mr. DJ and We've Got It Going On. I still love the breezy ballad Darlinwith its lush landscapes and bridges. It was smart that they added Everybody to the album in early '98--made the album have more energy to it! This helped start the boy band trend of nearly identical male groups, even a rival group which I won't say here. The singing's very good, as AJ McLean and Nick Carter's twin leads along with Brian Littrell's inclusions make the songs entertaining. Kevin Richardson and Howie Dorough provide good background singing. I still love Good Girl/Bad Boy and its rocking closing to the album! It has that AC/DC type feel to it with its naughtiness. This is a landmark album of many proportions!"
5,Cliffs Notes are good resources,"I bought this for my granddaughter, who is in High School. She read the play and wanted more information about it so I got the Cliffs Notes. They helped her understanding of certain aspects of the play and characters. It was a good buy!"
4,"Good, but I wish it had more details","This is a great subject area, but I wish that it had more details. I prefer the cookbook style that walks you through actual examples of implementation rather than the general descriptions in this book."
3,Maxsa Dual Laser Parking Review,"Although the device performs as advertised, the time that the lasers are activated (approx 15 sec) is too short, especially when moving the car into the final position. If the time was adjustable, I would have given this product a much higher rating. Unfortunately, I now have to find another device for this application."
2,"Works, but doesn't","The lasers on mine never turned off. I wanted to make sure I wasn't triggering the sensor so I setup the product in a location where I could see the lasers but not activate the motion sensor. Luckily, when I did this I did not install the backup batteries. The product worked just fine. Then I put the backup batteries in and the lasers never shut off. So, the product does not work with the backup batteries installed, but works just fine without the backup batteries. And if power goes out my garage door won't open anyway!"
2,Could be better,"Works as advertised, but difficult to aim the lasers because the adjustment range is limited and the motion is so tight that it's difficult to accurately aim them."
1,Laser doesn't stay active enough long,"I don't know if the issue is my car or the product. But as soon as I am driving inside my parking the Laser doesn't stay active at all, and go off and on all the time. I am going to look if there is a way I can modify it to disable the sensor and get it turning on when my garage light turn on."
4,Read all the reviews to get ideas from others,Purchased this product after carefully considering it and reading others reviews. This allowed me to plan ahead. After recieving the product I noticed how the sensors did not move as freely as i expected and many others mentioned this. I have a 11' ceiling so i did not have to worry about altering that. I tried to use it for two vehiciles but it was just not working. So like I read in another review someone used this model to project two points and it allows you to use them to see if you need to move more to the left or right when parking as well. I like the product and plan on purchasing another for our other vehicle.
3,2 units condensed into one doesn't work well,"This concept, a laser to assist garage parking, is excellent. The problem here is that these 2 beams come from one source & they cannot be spread far enough apart, even from our high garage ceiling, to contact one's cars in the preferred easily visible location. The solution would be either for the manufacturer to adjust the design to allow a wider spread of the laser beams or for the buyer to purchase 2 single units."
5,Maxsa Dual Laser Parking device,"Excellent product and it really works! My only complaint is the laser arms are a little restrictive for range of motion. We have a three car garage and park on opposite sides. It took a little more work to get the lasers to hit both cars in a place they could be seen, but once set up, we have had zero issue. Highly recommend!"
4,Good,Great math workbook. Seems to follow state core. Only negative- problems are set close together with little work space. My 7-year-old has a hard time fitting his work and answers into space provided.
3,a little disappointed,"It covers a lot of subjects which is very good, but too many useless complications that gets kids a bit confused. I'll try a different one next year."
2,The title is very misleading,"The title is misleadingThis book describes the very basics of the digital starting from logical elements and ending with shift and BCD registers. It barely touches Altera's Quartus 2 and VHDL language. If you are a student, who is just starting digital design class, maybe this is a good book. You'll learn the digital fundamentals very well (I would rate it 5 stars).If you want to know how to program VHDL, advanced patterns or Quartus 2, this book is not for you!"
4,We did not exploit all the capabilities of this textbook,"Some technical details of the textbook were not used by the course, so it was necessary to skip sections of the text. Clearly written"
5,"excellent, easy to understand resource","I have used herbs, & herbal remedies in the past, pre internet, then sort of forgot about them. You know busy etc..When Dr.'s started to prescribe way too much medicine, I thought, DUH!Well, I needed something easy to read because herbs, if you don't understand them, can be dangerous to your health. This book is easy to understand, and now with the internet, so I can find the herbs, all I can say is, Great!Just from getting back on track with what my body needs, I've lost 15lbs since Thanksgiving."
5,A great book,This is a wonderful book. I especially love the chapters on all the herbs and how to use them. A must have for anyone wanting to learn more and add these wonderful plants to their foods and medicine cabinet. There's a wealth of valuable information in this book.
1,One star may be optomistic,"I have been am Amazon customer since they opened the doors (well ok, website). Everthing I ever ordered arrived more or less on time, and more or less as promised; until this item. This one did not arrive. There is a very nice man in India or Pakistan who will read you a nice script about why the money is gone and your item has not arrived, but somehow that is not as satisfying as having your item actually arrive. I am sure there is some very fine print somewhere that would explain to me why this is OK, but after a few hour of looking, I give up."
1,Unremarkable with NO memorable songs,"An extremely unremarkalbe album with literally NO memorable or catchy songs - which is quite rare for Too Short. Simply put, do not buy this, even for the Too Short lover. Not horrible, just BORING and nothing like his previous efforts."
5,Everything he touch goes Platinum!!!!!,"This album is Too Short's best album in years. It has a smooth, laid-back type of vibe to it that makes you want to listen. His other albums after this one have been okay but not as good as this one. Buy it now!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Junk product,I hoped to wear these chaps for a Halloween costume and the sticking was falling apart from the start. I am going to have to buy a new set or do a lot of repair to make them last one night. I would NEVER wear these on a motorcycle. If the leather and stitching can't hold up to my living room they wont do anything in a crash.
1,"By far the worst set of ""chaps"" I have ever seen.","My wife ordered me these ""chaps"" so I could enjoy the last few days of riding for the year. When they got here, the ""fabric"" (NOT LEATHER) had color coming off of it. The seams were also coming apart when I opened the package. I know you get what you pay for, and can't expect great chaps for $30, but the chaps should at least be leather if that is what the description said. If anyone is even thinking about ordering these, don't waste your time, money, or effort. You will just be upset by the ""quality"" (HA HA HA) of this item. I hope I saved at least one person from making a very big mistake. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!! ALWAYS READ THE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A little snug,"The waist and length are just right. I wear a 34W 32L pant size and the thigh area is diffucult to pull up to where it needs to be. I am by no means thick around the thighs. If I ordered a larger size, I would have excess in the waist and in the length, so pick your poison. Otherwise a good value and high quality product."
2,Rock design Buffalo leather motorcycle chaps.,"I guess you get what you pay for. The buckle is as cheap as they come and the sizing is off.I measured my thighs with jeans on and they were 1/2"" smaller than the high range of the size I ordered. The chaps came in and they stopped about 3/4 of the way up my thigh. The zipper starts at the bottom so there was no way to get any additional slack. I got the chaps a day before leaving on an extended vacation and didn't try them on until returning home. By that time, my window for returning them had elapsed. I now have chaps that I will only be able to wear if I loose some weight."
3,NOT Genuine Leather,"These chaps are very inexpensive, and you get what you pay for. They look okay as long as you do not get closer than a few feet. With the exception of the bottom ten inches, these chaps are not leather, they are made from ""bonded leather"" which is synthetic with ground up leather particles added to it for the smell. You can easily tell that the ""patchwork"" pattern is fake. I do not know what possessed some of the reviewers to say that the leather is thick, or supple, it is not even close to any of that. The workmanship is as cheap as they come, these will definitely not hold up in a crash. The buckle is indeed the worst offender. If you only buy these for looks and some wind protection like I did, you should be fine, but if you want serious protection from the elements or a road slide, look elsewhere."
3,Nice product,"I bought these for my sister and I. We were very excited about them coming in the mail. Upon arrival we were very pleased with the chaps, nicely made but alas they were too small. I'm in the process now of returning them and will be ordering the next size up."
4,Great for Review or with Outside Helps,"Having worked withComplete Babylonian: A Teach Yourself Guide (Teach Yourself: Level 4)andA Manual of Akkadian, I have found this to be the most difficult of three. As an earlier review noted, this is not for self-study. However, even if you're learning on your own, with suitable companion texts this is a must to add to the list for two reasons: 1) There are exercises from Akkadian to English, without which it becomes to easy to skip over the intricacies of the forms so long as the words look familiar. 2) It quickly gets you used to the idea of watching for sumerograms (ideograms) as well as sound signs.Caplice is too dense for someone taking their first stab at Akkadian/Babylonian. But if you have some exposure from elsewhere, it's an excellent text for reviewing and solidifying your understanding of Akkadian, and turning the forms into something you know, from use, as opposed to recognizing from reading. If only it had an answer key!"
4,Not bad for its era,"Fairly interesting Hollywood exageration/blending/confusion of historical facts. If you overlook all of the details that don't match reality, this is an entertaining movie.For those of us who live in South Dakota and know the areas where this was filmed, it's fun to see the landscape."
4,TOMAHAWK BY VAN HEFLIN VHS,IT ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND IN GOOD CONDITION. HE LIKED IT ALOT!!!!!!HE'S GLAD HE BOUGHT IT SINCE IT WAS SO HARD TO FIND!!!!!!
5,Just as ordered!,Havent seen movie because I ordered this movie for an uncle of mine who was an extra in the movie. He had been searching for this movie for quite some time. It was great to let him relive his younger days.
5,Great pan at a great price!,We finally had the chance to use this pan... our 5 yr old made a spice cake and sprinkled powdered sugar on it. A very easy activity for her and yet the pan is so pretty the cake looks beautiful with the sunflower lines on it. She wanted to tip the pan over so we let it cool longer than normal and the cake came out on the bake rack beautifully by just a 5 yr old tipping it. The extra time in the pan did not cause it to brown too much and she was able to hold the rubber edges and be in control of turning it over. No sticking and cleanup was a breeze. Now she wants to try brownies in it!! Great deal.
4,heavy duty pan,This is a great item...the silicone handles and non-stick features are great.....I only wish that the sunflower was a little better defined....so I am giving this a 4 star.
5,great shorts,"The material used on thses shorts are not to thick or thin, breatheable yet strong...just right for the Iraq summer"
4,A Molotov Cocktail of classical and flamenco-- furious stuff,"There's a sense of urgency throughout this album that makes it one of De Lucia's most exhilerating. The effect is achieved by the deft use of percusion and electric bass as well as the intriguing yet cohesive blend of classical and flamenco schools. The music straddles both worlds, giving the songs more suggestiveness and freeedom while at the same time retaining a strong sense of form. De Falla's compositions are tight and fast yet grandiose and ambitious. It's music full of punch and a showcase of sheer relentless inventiveness. Add to this De Lucia's furious playing and one has a hybrid whose influences may be self-evident but whose effect is stunning, to say the least. There's a definite modern sound to this album, although the arrangements themselves are sparse, that gives it a dynamism seldom found in other De Lucia works."
3,Not a Bad Summer Reading Choice,I read this novel for the purpose of completeing a summer assignment for my AP US history Class. It had a decnet plotline and is by the obviously reputable Stowe. A very interesting historical novel that kept me entertained enough to finish and wirte a paper about. Focuses on slavery in new england and the love between a minister and the daughter of the woman with whom he is residing.
2,Failed attempt to reclaim the death metal crown,"""Maximum Violence"" can be summed up in just one word, ""FAILED"". In their attempt to reclaim the golden crown of death metal, Six Feet Deep have unleashed masterpiece of muddled riffs, and horrible vocals. At best, this is a mid-paced joining of metal and hardcore, combined with the outdated vocal belching of former Cannibal Corpse frontman Chris Barnes. With songs focused around death, murder, rape, and insanity, one could almost say the novelty is over. Also found on the album (depending on which version you have), there are 3 covers, ""War Machine"" by Kiss, ""Wrathchild"" by Iron Maiden, and ""Jailbreak"" by Thin Lizzy. The slaughtering of these classics should have been left off, so that their good names would not be smeared in this failure. Not all of the musical efforts are bad, but they do not show any lasting improvements either, especially with the vocals. Bottom line, save your money for something better to come along."
3,Pretty good overall,"This is a hell of a lot better than their last album; overall a pretty decent offering. It DOES NOT COMPARE to the latest Cannibal Corpse release (Incredible!), which is SFU's vocalist's old band... and as for the reference to Slipknot in a previous review: few metal bands in existence can touch Slipknot."
4,death metal icons,"Barnes is the man.He's everything thta cool he smokes pot,cusses,speaks his mind and is basically the creator of death metal.the time he put with corpse was good I really liked Eaten BackTo Life and Tomb Of The Mutilated.But CorpseGrinder is betterwith Corpse.Barnes rules the mic when it comes to SFU.They dopossibly their best covers on this one War Machine and Jailbreak.They hit the notes dead on they just better the songs with heavy instrument work and some sick growling.All others are goodas well this is SFU's best offer to date with some killer coverartwork by tatto god Paul Booth.Pick this one up today."
3,"Too much Speed, not enough Death","With the loss of former Obituary guitarist Allen West, SFU's 3rd studio release reminds me more of Cannibal Corpse than it does Six Feet Under. However, many of the songs still have some basic structure to them & are pretty decent. ""Feasting ..."" ""Victim ..."" & ""Graveyard Earth"" are all excellent Death Metal songs & the remake of Kiss' ""War Machine"" is by far the best song on the album. If this is your first SFU album, I'd consider their two previous releases, but if you like Cannibal Corpse & other such Speed bands, by all means, pick this up. Personally, though, I'll leave Speed Metal to the likes of Slayer, Overkill & early Megadeth & I'd rather SFU stick with their brand of slow, grinding Death Metal."
2,Does nothing for me.,"I know what you think. Little Limp Bizkit fan has somehow got wind of a horrible horrible death metal album, and doesn't understand it's brutality and technicality. WRONG. It is in fact the other way around. I find this boring, simple and quite tame. This isn't particularly crushing, its just mid-paced death metal. The riffs are relatively simple and comprise of a few chords, the drums are amatuerish, the bass is non-existent and musically this is stagnant. Nothing original or innovative what so ever. The vocalist has a pretty good growl (although I prefer Chris In Cannibal Corpse and I think they're a better band generally) and I suppose the lead guitarist knows what he's doing to some extent, but really. Just take a look at Nile's ""From The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka"", Morbid Angel's ""Blessed Are The Sick"" or Cryptopsy's ""Whisper Supremacy"" for some death metal that gives a REAL kick..."
1,empty!!!!!!!,"i've ever listened an album as boring as max... simple rhythms,ordinary riffs ... that's all.."
4,Not Exactly Innovative....But Who Cares?,"SFU's ""Maximum Violence"" is not exactly ground-breaking music by anyone's standards. As far as death metal goes, it is pretty much the garden vaariety servings that other bands dish up. However, it is brutal, it is low growly, and SFU are good at what they do: garden variety death metal that sounds good.The title pretty much says it all: violence. If violence isn't your thing, steer clear of this one. For those who are into a good shocker, this is excellent material starting right from the first track. Hacking and slashing soak this CD in musical blood, so to speak.The music is punchy, with some excellent chords and guitar work. The rhythms worked well, while not being overdone to hell. The vocals are, without doubt, excellent.Overall, this is a good CD for the death metal fan who just wants some good, simple music to zone out to. Innovative it isn't, but I really didn't mind too much."
4,Six Feet Under's Best CD!,"The addition of new guitarist Steve Swanson gave the band something it's never had before--a good guitarist. Songs like ""Feasting on the Blood of the Insane"" and ""Victim of the Paranoid"" are two of my favorite death metal songs. They sound much like Cannibal Corpse, but I think they're better than Corpse. This is a great death metal CD and I would recommend getting it if you like brutal, hardcore, screaming lyrics, pulsating bass drums, and endless guitar riffs. The negative side of the disc has many of the songs sounding alike and the disc loses its touch after the first half. But the first half is great. Although it's not a perfect five stars (just for a feeling reason; the CD doesn't feel like it's five stars), it's a good buy for the ultimate death/power metal fan."
1,No no no no no no WRONG!,"Ok take a steaming pile of poo,put your nose up to it and have someone fart in your ear wa-la 6 feet under."
1,Sounds just like Cannibal Corpse....,Sounds like Cannibal Corpse which I think is horrible.This CD doesnt even deserve a 1 star it should get a 0.I wouldnt recomend this try Slipknot or Static-x.
2,"Was a fan, not now","I have three of their albums, but I dont listen to them much anymore...I cant stand the vocals and there isnt much thought to the musicDEATH METAL NEEDS AMPLE SOLO WORK!"
5,BAD @$$,This CD is maxed out to the max. I love this CD with all my heart. I listen to this all of the time. Everyone thinks I'm wierd but oh well. It's a great CD. The lyrics really grow on you.
4,Much Better,"Now that Allen West is gone, sfu has a much better sound. No more boring riffs and faster than before. Chris Barnes goes back to his roots with his vocals. But getting Steve Swanson has been, so far, the best thing that could have happened to this band!"
5,GREATEST DEATH METAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME,"This cd is by far sfu's best album. The lyrics are the best I've heard by far, and the guitars kick a**! Chris Barnes puts out great vocals that will blow you away! If you have never heard SFU or you just started listening to metal this is the one to get. You will not be disappointed at all. If you like it gory and hard then by this album!"
4,Super Cute for Horse Lovers,This is a very cute horse and my duaghter loves how it comes with a crown and gold braids in it's tail and mane. Very soft yet still poseable. Only Hearts horses are a great line of toys.
5,Awesomeness,"The new album,In Love And Death is awesome. They have a different sound which is more towards emo but i love emo anyway but don't worry they still have some songs that you can get pumped up with. This album is great but of course not better then the 1st. Only the REAL true fans of The Used will love this and understand the emotions in the songs."
1,The Used!!!!!!!!!!,"Buy this cd under one condition! if you are (...) They wont even play this cd at my skate park any more because it is so retarded! Plus you will never be able to get a girlfriend listening to this trash, bro. My mom probably wouldn't even let me listen to this cd. anyways wear a helmet if you skate, Tony hawk and bam margera are awesome!"
3,What the hell happened?,"Alright, The Used first album (their self-titled) is my favourite album ever and has been for the past few years. I bought In Love and Death expecting more of the same amazing music, but instead I found something I thought I'd never hear from The Used. Bad music and more than enough Power-Pop songs. There are literally 2 songs I like on their new CD. Sound Effects and Overdramatics and Listening. The rest are merely mediocre.I was pretty shocked at how different this was. If The Used release a new album and it's even MORE powerpoppy, you can guarentee I'll lose the faith I still have in The Used to make another amazing album.Come on, The Used. Start writing music like you were on your Self-Titled album and make some more incredible music. You've already sold yourself out. At least start making good music again."
2,What a let down!,"The Used was my favourite band before i heard ""in love and death"" They were my favourite band because of their originality and agression! I gave the album 2 stars coz it has 4 good songs but the rest were shocking! NO originality, No gut! I know Burt lost a close friend but thats no reason to go all mellow! They have tried to cover up the mellowness with dark and scary artwork on the album, but its not working! Dont expect to be blown away by hard hitting music! I am still a fan of the first album and im going to put In love and death in my crap pile of CD's! I hope they wont dissapoint us with the next!"
2,"very disappointed, some good songs","i agree with a couple reviews back, this album was full of potential but i had a gut feeling that they'd turn mainstream. For those of us who apprecate their self titled, there's just a few songs that remind me of ST (1,3,9,12). The rest of the cd just sounds like a different band and as if they didnt really try to make unique music. it just sounds like another poppy punk band with Bert's voice singing. Hopefully it is a sophmore slump and they realize this, or maybe it will grow on me. still i hoped for more energy, thats what made my skin crawl from the first cd, with the blood curtling screaming. its a made for radio cd."
2,the used did have good lyrics once upon a time obv ur a moron and havent seen the lyrics from the first cd,"they did have good lyrics on the first cd. now they suck, yes, and they werent always pop only now they are, and ur an idiot. go listen to ur terrible dropkick murphys and incubus you faggetthis cd is mediocre"
3,Yes,I personally don;t find this album that much good. All the songs are pretty dull to me. It feels as if they can't think of anything good to make up for a song.
2,im stickin with their old stuff,"i think that the used's new album, in love and death, wasn't as good as i was hoping it would be. not to be dissing or anything, but its different from their old music, it is as if they turned into somewhat emo. yeah, there is a couple good ones in love and death, but their self titled album songs were as if mostly all the songs were good. the used has a variety type of songs, one song might be smooth going like Blue And Yellow, and others are a mix of little emo & mostly screamo. it seems as if their new one is too much emo and little screamo. i'm kind of dissapointed in their new one, though its different, its not as good as their old albums. mostly anybody who i ask abouth their new album says that it isnt as hard rock and as good compared to their other ones, and i agree."
3,"wow was i wrong (5 STARS, NOT 3.5!!!)","THIS CD ROCKS! i wrote a review about a week or so ago saying that this cd wasnt very good becasue it wasnt as hardcore as the first. let me tell you, i was dead wrong. i listened to it a couple more times and by the second or third time it got really good. the soft songs (yesterday's feelings, lunacy fringe, and number ten which i forget the name of) are just as good as the hard ones. the used is going in a different direction and it works for me. i say this cd is even with the first because of the amount of times ive listened to the first. this cd is great, worth the money, and a great buy."
4,GREAT CD,"This CD covers so many emotions, from love to hate, to death to anger.Definitely a worthwhile album to add to any collections!!"
2,"""Oh, my gawd, lyke.. ""","First off.. I just have to say.. this album is one of the worst follow-ups ever. This does NOT sound like The Used at all! This is some silly-faggot pop-emo-prep crap. I expected The Used to stay strong, and make a good follow-up. It's a good thing I didn't buy this album like I planned on. This isn't even half as good as their old album. First, A Static Lullaby goes bad.. Now it's the Used.. next it'll be Dead Poetic.. and then the world will end. The only good song on this album is ""Take it Away"" along with another song, I don't remember the name.. P-a-t-h-e-t-i-c w-a-s-t-e o-f m-o-n-e-y and t-i-m-e . Period."
1,More Trendy music... more 1 stars...?,"The used.The people who actually buy this crap should feel used.Because a year from now, it will be hidden away just like the past trendsTrends come and go, but real music lives on Forever.Trendy music...... Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Backstreet Boys, N Sync, Afi...... and now Atreyu, Fata, The Used, and basically all this emo garbage put out their."
1,MTV Emo,"How anyone could confuse this commercial junk for real emo (Fugazi or one of the Discord bands)or hardcore (Hatebreed, early CoC) is beyond my comprehension. Buy this CD if you have a positive view of Hot Topic or if you think that pop-punk requires talent or imagination to play."
1,Funny stuff!,"Love the misspellings and obtuse syntax in the reviews. Little less time with the headbanging and a little more time with the books, whatta ya say doods?"
1,horrible,"The Used used to be good, but In Love and Death SUCKS!!!!!!!....i liked 2 songs on here ""Cut Up Angels"" and ""I'm a Fake"" but other than them 2 songs..they suck.....this is almost as bad as the (...) MCR plays.....RUBBISH!!!!!"
1,sophmore SLUMP,"i love the self titled album, and that album is what changed me from gc and simple plan to hardcore and screamo. this album makes me feel like they want me to like that genre again. this cd PISSES ME OFF!!! dont get me wrong, this band is sooooooo talented but they have in a way sold out in my mind; therefore they receive 0 stars, but i cant give them 0, so they got 1. maybe their next album should be hardcore and screamo not pop like britney spears and good charlotte. this album pisses me off!!!"
5,Love it!,"Great cd, don't expect it to sound like any of their other cds though! All of The USED's cds have a slightly different style and sound, but all of them are masterpeices. I love this cd! Awesome band!"
5,Five Used Stars for Your Taking,"Many artists have attempted to create a five star album, but not many have succeeded. One of the bands that is capable of a five star rating though, is the Used.The Used's latest CD ""In Love and Death,"" is an amazing mix of songs with many different sounds. You can listen to ""Take it Away"" or ""I'm a Fake,"" if you really want to rock hard, or if you prefer a slower song you could try ""Hard to Say,"" or Yesterday's Feelings."" The whole album is amazing, but the songs that i think are the best on the album are Life With a Sharpened Edge,"" ""Cut Up Angels,"" ""Lunacy Fringe,"" and ""I Caught Fire.""This album follows in the footsteps of the Used's previous two albums and displays the pain many people in life go through, dealing with love and hard times.""In Love and Death,"" is by far one of the best albums recorded in the past year, and in my opinion deserves 5 stars."
1,"hey sean, way to sell out","so, i used to have lots of respect for the band Coalesce, until Sean Ingram decided to do vocals on this piece of garbage here. as you can tell from my review of the used's self-titled joke you know how i feel about this waste of space. way to sell out Sean, just because some skinny nerd wears your shirt in a video doesn't mean you have to do vocals on their cd."
2,WHAT HAPPENED????!!!!,"Simply put, this album as a whole SUCKS. How can a band with that much potential make an album like this? They used to be rockers! Over half of this crap is so poppy it doesnt even sound like them. Now i know they can still write good music, from hearing songs like Listening, Take It Away, Sound Effects and Overdramatics, and Let it Bleed. Those songs are good (Im a Fake is okay too). But COME ON! Where is the old band that created a masterpiece as their debut album? I don't recommend this at all. If you want a good cd, get the first one. The Used has basically sold out with In Love and Death."
2,Doesnt live up to the hype,"The first cd is a classic, such a great cd, and you would just expect nothing but the same from the new one. This really isn't the case here. I seriously can't find 3 songs that I can listen to more than once off of this album, they have went so main stream with their sound now, that they have completely lost their roots. With the slow ballads, the fast up-beat songs, I can only really enjoy one song, and thats song number six. I'm really dissapointed in this album, really isn't what I was expecting, besides the fact that it really isn't all that good in the first place."
1,"The Used, more like, The Sucky","First of all, I enjoy a lot of emo, punk, and rock. Some of my friends really like this album so I thought that I would give it a shot. The Used have a whiny, and very unoriginal sound. I was very dissapointed. All of their songs sound very like one another. Check out some better bands, like My Chemical Romance, Green Day, and Hot Hot Heat. I give it a boooooo.!"
5,This CD took my breath away!,"I wasn't really into emo music when I first listened to this CD, but it has really grown on me! In Love and Death is a great combination of fast-paced punk mixed with slower, more soulful songs. The lead singer's voice is great both when screaming and while singing really heartfelt lyrics. There's amazing guitar and drumwork, as well as some cool sound effects and nice, and even humorous details.My 3 favorite songs are ""I caught fire,"" ""Light with a sharpened edge"" and ""Lunacy Fringe"" - but they're all really good. This CD is amazing!!!!!"
4,very nice second release,"do not bash this bands second cd. Im telling you its not that bad and it certainly was a very anticipated release and I dont think that anybody would be dissapointed to hear it. It was not quite as original as the first cd, but it was still a great release all together. I caught fire, and all that ive got are very good songs, and Berts singing is just amazing. the songs closer Im a fake is a good song, that releates to alot of posers out there, and its a good one to close the album with. alot like pieces mended on the first cd, it rocks your world. the weakes songs are probably (cut up angles, and a light with a sharpened edge.) let it bleed for some reason really catches my attention all the time. anyway, go buy the cd and give it a chance, you will not be dissapointed"
3,the good and the bad.,"I love The Used, and it pains me to say anything less than positive about them, but I must be truthful when I say I was not half as in love with this album as the last. There wasent a song on the previous album that I didnt adore, but only a few I loved on the new one. ""Let it Bleed"", ""Im a Fake"", ""Take it Away"" and ""Soundeffects"" were about it for me. This CD sounded more contrived than the last...less from the gut. No matter what, these guys rock, and are extremly talented and I will stay devoted no matter what:]"
2,disappointed,"you buy the CD, and listen to ""Take It Away"" and think WOW! this is gonna be awesome, and it all goes downhill from there...peaople say that ""All That I've Got"" is a great track, i think take that amd boyzone could have done a better version, its just sounds so pop music, and whiny, i just want to strangle Bert on this track.listen to the first album ""The Used"" its much better.all in all very disappointed!"
3,It's okay...,"I do not own this album; one of my best friends does. Every freaking time I go to her house, this is album is all I hear. So I know the words to the songs and all that. I also have only heard a few songs off the first album, so there's not much to compare to as far as that goes.The lyrics are pretty repetitive and redundant. There's a whole lot about scars, fire, cutting, and death. All the songs seem to be about the same thing, and after a while you get tired of it. The songs run together, and I hardly ever know when the song changes.Good things? It's catchy. Good for when you're in a craptastic mood... or in a mood for hearing songs about scabs.Overall, this album is just okay. I think I would like it less though, if I actually owned it. The tracks I like are ""All That I've Got"" (it's overplayed, I know, but I like it) ""Listening,"" ""Sound Effects and Overdramatics,"" and ""Let it Bleed"""
3,Oh No...,"Basically, The Used have turned more or less into a pop punk band. Nearly every element of hardcore left remaining in their music has vanished leaving Bert singing (not screaming) the same song over and over again. Songs 2 through 8 sounds pretty much the same. I am a huge fan of their first CD, don't get me wrong, I'm not just bashing them because I'm not a fan, but this CD did not reach my expectations. If you are a huge The Used fan go buy it, but if not i'd recomend not buying because its not a must buy. Sorry Guys... better luck on the next one."
4,buy it,"Well this cd has a very nice touch to it, although it is my fav it has room for improvement. I would personally like to hear a little more screamo in the mix. my fav would prolly be sound effects and overdramatics."
5,what a band can do,"after listening to the first cd which was awesome i knew i just had to go see these guys and they are awesome, i was just waiting for them to come out with something new, and i think that in love and death is there best one because of some of the changes they have made, sound effects and overdramatics is probably the best hardcore song on there which sound like deftones. i'm a fake is the best on there cuz' of the bizzare intro, go buy it."
3,"Um, it's alright...not great!","Yeah, their first CD is better. Lots more memorable tunes with that one I think.But as for this one? It's solid. It's GOOD music. But nothing really stands out. It's just something that's good to listen to, not something I'd seek out TO listen to. If you know what I mean."
3,My first taste of The Used,"The first time I heard about this band was through listening to their song 'All That I've Got'. Having listened and liked that song I decided to purchase the entire CD. First off this band shows alot of potential however like several other bands out in the alternative rock genre they sound too much alike other groups. What makes or break a band is their individualism and through their own sound and gimmick do they attain a identity that people know them by. Secondly though, it was an enjoyable CD all the same.From what I hear this is The Used' second album and for me to fully appreciate their sound I will get the first album. Another good song on this release is 'Take It Away' and 'Yesterday's Feelings'. This band is young and through career experience they should be able to adopt their own sound and stick with it and gain a strong identity say like Staind or U2 has."
3,Hmmm.....,"The first thing I have to say is it was awesome to begin the CD with ""Take it Away"" but it definely didn't set up the tone of their whole album. Let's not be mistaken, I do respect the fact that The Used wanted to go in a new direction with their music cuz I can admit that if I was in a band, that I would get bored making the same kind of album repeatedly. At first, I thought this was one of those follow-up albums that I would have to get used to first and then formulate my opinion. I did that with Poison the Well's jump to their latest album ""You Come Before You"" and then, the music started to grow on me. ""In Love and Death"" just did not do it for me. There were some songs like ""Cut Up Angels"" and ""All That I've Got"" and, definetly, ""Take it Away"" that are catchy but thats it. Oh yea... last song is cool too. I would pay 10 bucks for this album but nothing more."
3,Not so much...,"I LOVE the Used, but this CD isnt nearly as good as there debut, i got this CD about a month ago and im already sick of it, im back to listeing to the first one, no screaming, all the songs are slower then the first CD, they needed more songs like take it away."
3,Ummm...... Guys..,"This cd has been out all of what, 2 days? How can you possibly have come to the conclusion that this cd isn't good so quickly? Maybe I'm not normal but I can't even form an opinion on 99% of the cd's I listen to until at least the 3rd listen through and even then it's only a rough feel for the cd. If you've listend to the cd at least 20 times you can talk but until then maybe you should just hold back so you don't have to change your mind later. At least give it a chance before you make up your mind.I'm giving it three stars right now because I haven't even heard the cd yet, but maybe after I've heard it 20+ times I come back here and change this."
1,"Horrible, even in it's genre","This has to be the most uninspired album that I've had the misfortune of listening to in a LONG while. I must admit upfront that I really don't care for the genre of this band, but I thought their self-titled cd was decent (maybe a 2 or 2 and 1/2 stars out of 5). The only redeeming quality of this disc, however, is that it doubles as a coaster for my cold beverages."
2,To all fans of the used:,"This album is not okay. (i promise). Seriously. Teeny boppers everywhere take note: The Used has as much soul as the bottom of my shoe, and talent reminiscent of My Chemical Romance. None. Stop polluting the earth with your fecal bands. One day everyone will laugh at bands like this, and cherish bands like Yellowcard. Punk Rock violin is AWESOME! Seriously though, get some roots, listen to some spice girls (early stuff) and new kids on the block (uncorporate stuff). Ubiquitous. THE MAN."
1,Please spare yourself,"I have one rule surrounding this CD... If you liked the first album, don't listen to this one and let it be ruined. However, if you didn't like the first one, let this album serve as punishment for not like such an amazing album... Please come back to the way you used to be, the Used!"
1,I'll try to be fair here...,"I could try to take up the ""this is a poser pop-punk band!"" argument, but I'm not going to. Focusing on the guitars and drums, I feel that the pop-punk label is sort of a stretch. So I'm going to focus on the Used biggest problem as a band:THE USED HAVE THE WORST SINGER IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC.My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Good Charlotte, blink 182---none of these bands vocals compare to the awfulness that the Used acheive effortlessly. This guy's(?) vocals are so distracting that any appeal that the guitars might have (not that they have much, but as I said it's hard to tell) is gone.So, if you really like those four bands I mentioned above, the Used's singer might not bother you. If you are normal, then I highly recommend that you stay away because listening to this band's metrosexual ****** will probably make you instantly throw out the CD."
1,Eh.................,"I'm so sick of seeing Burt on Fuse TV groping Steven...... I remember Steven saying that Nickelback were a bunch of hacks, yet, he'll gladly be all lovey-dovey with one of the worst bands EVER!!!! You both suck.... How does that sound???? Fuse is a real disappointment....."
1,UM...... NO!,"What the HELL is this?!?!? I heard them oepn for blink 182 once and i thought they were great. I saw their video for ""take it away"" on much music and i loved it so i decided to buy it. HUGE MISTAKE! The only good songs on this whole album are: ""Soundaffects and over dramatics"" and ""Take it away"". I mean theres one song called: ""Lunacy Fringe"" The intro sounds mexican almost! And then ""soundeffects and over dramatics"" is like hardcore punk. DECIDE ON WHAT GENRE YOU ARE! What is with that spoken corny intro of ""Im a fake"" ??? SERIOSULY NO! I DO NOTTTTTTTTTTTTT RECOMEND IT..!!GRRRWHAT A WASTE OF 20$"
1,Feeling Used,"For the first time in my life an album has left me speechless, and not in a good way. I'm still trying to grasp the concept of how they could actually put something like this out. The Used are a good band, but this cd is not. If you loved the debut album, you will be disgusted by this one, it is absolutely nothing like the last album. Lyrics are mediocre at best, and the melodies sound like....like........for lack of a better word, horrible. Nothing original here like the self-titled album. Just bunch of crap tied together, to make more crap, so that it can be spoon fed to the highest music consumer market......little teenage girls. In Love & Death, should have been more like 'whatever originality we had, we just lost with this album.'"
3,Disappointment...,"The Used's self titled album was one of the best albums ever made. It had hardcore punk which is what people expect from the used. On this new album, the only good songs are ""Take it away,"" ""Listening,"" ""Sound Effects and Overdramatics,"" and ""I'm a Fake."" The Used should make another album with some songs like ""A Box Full Of Sharp Objects"" and ""The Taste Of Ink.""For all you people who say this album shows how good Bert's voice is, I saw them in concert this summer at Projekt Revolution and they are terrible in concert. Bert's voice is mainly computerized because he can't sing in concert. He got booed. However, on the albums his voice is amazing so it doesn't matter.For all of you soft rockers, this is the album for you. If you're looking for good music like the first album by the Used, you'll find a little on this but not as much as the first."
3,Lame,"I was expecting this release to come on full stream ahead and pick up where they left off. I was wrong. They softened up and created the perfect cd that will be loved by all the high school cheerleaders and jocks (just like the new Taking Back Sunday). Oh well - I don't blame them - it's this crowd that keeps them rich - I would cater to them too. If you're looking for a cd that rocks with vocals more intense than Bert's and songs with more hooks than a tackle box - get the new Rise Against - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED. And oh yea - the new Finch cd won't let you down - I heard the new stuff, and it knarly."
3,Hmmm......,"First off lets get to the point this album cannot touch the first one. The first Used album is damn classic in terms of albums out today. The first thing i noticed was that there is alot more screaming, and the album seemed to lack any of those ""box full of sharp object"" type used anthems. The album seems a little more on the emo/screamo side as well. But hey you know every damn kid is going to jock this album like no other and claim they discovered the used when they were cold chillin on the monkey bars. Is this a good album yes, should you go out and purchase it well i suggest you listen to it first. But dont download it def go support!! Just my two cents"
4,A Good Surprise,"While this album is not exactly what I expected out of a sophmore album from The Used, I was definitely happy with the outcome. In Love and Death is not as hard-hitting as the self-titled, but their new sound is impressive. This album will be more appealing to the masses, and they pulled it off without turning ""MTV"". Bert's vocals do not express the same amount of angst, but the lyrics are nothing to frown at. I only have 2 major critiques, and 1 is that Bert's voice fluctuation is one of his best attributes, and he doesn't show it as much as he could in this album. My other is that for some reason they chose not to portray Branden Steineckert's speed on the set in nearly enough tracks. Overall, the album is worth a lot more than the money you'd spend on it, and everyone should go and buy it, whether you were into The Used before this or not.Preferred Tracks: 1,2,3,5,6,11"
5,Love these guys.,"I've already owned this cd once but lost it. Seeing as how I'm a big used fan, I felt I had to buy it again and complete my collection, along with their newest album vulnerable. I totally get why some people don't like the used (my girlfriend being one of them) but I have been into them since their first album. I own their entire catalogue. I love their energy on the hard songs and the melodic chillness of the soft ones. And that right there is one of my favorite things about them- every album offers a variety of sounds, a tapestry if you will, of hard and soft, fast and slow songs but all are bursting with emotion. Long story short, buy this if you even remotely like the used or the emo genre in general."
2,VERY dissapointing,"read the title, after Take it away theres not much to look forward to on this cd. All that we've grown to love about The Used in their first album someone got flushed down the toilet after the bands trip to mexico and a bad bunch of burritos. What happens in mexico stays in mexico.....unfortunetly for us"
3,hmmm,"Okay here's the lo-down kids. First off this cd has very little resemblance to the first. And yes it is ""pop""py. I mean if you like MTV's Top 40 countdown crap then you will most likely enjoy majority of the cd. There is hope for the more hardcore fans with a few of the songs. I agree with most when I say that it does take a few times for the cd to grow on you, but if you like the style, layout, and intensity of the first then you may want to wait and see what their 3rd will be like. They definantly took a different turn with this album and I can say that they blew an awesome chance to have an incredible follow-up album. The cd is decent. I would say the it is about 50/40/10. 50% good/40% crap/ 10% listenable (if that's even a word). Anyway, I give it 3 stars and will recommend only because it does a few really good tracks and is a nice accent to the collection."
4,The Used - In Love and Death,"An excellent follow-up to the debut CD. More melodic but still plenty of high-energy music with a couple of tasteful ballads thrown in for variety.Produced in HDCD, if your player can decode it, you can hear the difference.Highly recommended."
1,Bert's voice is so God DAMN ANNOYING!!!,"BERT, please don't scream.You sound like a pansy little poofter.If you are going to continue screaming, do it in an artistic way that also sounds good.For example, the lead singer of Foo Fighters."
1,sad to say.,"ive had this cd since it came out and i neevr really listened to it... well i tried to but i could never get past the 3rd song without wondering, ""this is the used?"" and shutting it off and turning on their S/T Debut. Well i finally listened to the entire cd and i have to say its all crap except for one song, ""Sound Effects and Overdramatics"", and that song is really really good (thanks to the singer of Coalesce, who were one of the best bands ever). i'm sure that if you are a fan of mtv's ""flavor of the week"" bands you'll love this. If you want a good pop-punk cd pick up Fall Out Boy's ""Take This To Your Grave"" or Motion City Soundtrack's ""I AM THE MOVIE"". If you want a good screamo release pick up Thrice's ""Illusion of Safety"" or Thursday's ""Full Collapse"". and if you want a good hardcore cd buy Every Time I Die's ""Hot Damn"" or anything by Converge."
2,Oh please...,"More of the same tunes, the same lyrics, and the same way of expressing lame musical theory. I have no idea how bands like this get such a great following. People!! Bands like this are making HUGE bucks off of your inability to see through their cheap superficiality. This is another band, spawned from the middle class suburbs with plenty of cash to start with and nothing new to say. If you just want energy and aggressive sound, go check out when it started with Black Flag or Descendents (Milo Goes to College). But if you like this whining, ""troubled"" show of teenage angst, yeah check out bands like this. I mean, they tour; if you don't mind paying 300% more than you ought for blah blah music. It's your paycheck."
2,Definite Sophomore Slump,"This album was a real letdown after the promise of the first one. I can't think of an album that I bought with so much excitement only to be this disapointed. While the first album had emotional music with originality, great songwriting and the perfect metal tinges,In Love and Death seems like it was slapped together. I kept trying to get into it, but the songs just don't have any soul. The first one was impossible to not listen to. Sometimes magic is hard to recaputure, I guess. Let's hope things look up with the third album."
2,disappointing,"I was a big fan of the first cd, it was different, it was poetic, beautiful and brutal at the same time, so i was very excited for the new album, ive had it for about three days now, have listened to it back to front about 10 times, and have yet to find one good solid song i enjoy. It just seems the band, from top to bottom decided to completely change their style of music, which is treading very close to pop rock. Bert the lead singer has one of the most unusual sounding voices, one of the most memorable screams, and i cant say that even once on this cd he's shown his potential. Overall its a big let down and it sucks to see another great band go ""mtv""."
2,Poorly Organized,"I live in Northern, CA, so I was particularly excited when I found this book. I had hoped that I could use it to find new waters to fish, wherever I was in CA. Unfortunately, the book is organized poorly, by watershed, as opposed to locality. If you don't know which rivers drain where, finding a new place to fish is a real pain. Once you do find it, there doesn't seem to be much detail. I was able to use it to find several BODIES of water (lakes, lagoons, etc.), but overall this book ends up being a poorly thought-out manual by someone who is evidently quite knowledgeable on the subject. Too bad--maybe a second edition will correct these problems."
2,Cryptic,This book would be excellent for someone who is already familiar with signals but is not good for the student who is learning the topic. Very few examples and no student solutions manual makes it a hard sell. For those after theory only.
2,Georgia Tech student perspective,"Awful for a control system course (which is what it is intended for and used for at Georgia Tech). The only good control/systems sections were on root locus and Bode design. The first half of the book is on refresher material from DSP (Laplace transforms, etc.). Try Gene Franklin's Feedback Design book for a much more sophisticated approach (with examples!) on actual control systems."
4,"Good shipping, good packaging, average binding","I ordered this book using one day shipping and it arrived <36 hours later... very impressive (and useful when you want to keep up with a college class without also being had by the bookstore). Packaging was okay: shrink-wrapped to a sturdy piece of cardboard and placed inside a box. Would have preferred some sort of padding, peanuts, etc., but book arrive undamaged. Print and paper quality is overall good, and size is acceptable, but the binding is iffy - especially concerning the reference pages on the inner and outer cover (constants, etc. bound in right after the title page). The book sat on a table and was only opened to read, and these inside first few pages are already 3/4 of the way out of their binding! I'm slightly miffed that a book at this price-point does that, but overall fairly satisfied."
3,It works,"The book is short and mostly clear. The biggest problem with it is no odd or even answers in the back. Without this it makes it nearly impossible to learn since you do not know whether your answers are right or not. Also, it does not include an index of fourier to real function graphs with their fourier phases. These graphs make learning transforms infinitely easier. It also has few examples that help clarify the material. On the plus side, if this is a review or second time looking at this material, it is a great reference/review book."
2,Not the BSB CD I wanted,"A few years ago we had a BSB CD and we LOVED all the songs on it. That CD broke or got scratched, so I wanted a new one. I looked on Amazon and found this one. It had a listing of the songs on it and I recognized them, so I ordered it...BUT, it only has about 1/2 the good songs as the original BSB CD. I was VERY dissapointed. I don't know if this CD is one that was released in a different country, or a newer CD with some old songs on it, but it is a rip off because it only has about 6 songs that we listen to."
4,Classic,Classic BSB in the old days. It's a great CD of good sugery pop love tunes! You have to love it!
1,Roger Whittaker Irish Standards,"Disappointed. Album was on sale and when I ordered this I was unaware that it was a live concert recording. My favorite song ""Danny Boy"" was ruined by a voice from the audience making frequent comments. Not worth keeping in my music collection."
3,It's okay,I think Dennis Day is a better singer. I like whitaker on some of the songs but not all.I have since purchased D. Day and am happier.
5,A tremendous help and a great clean massaging feeling for your feet.,"I have had Soapy Soles for over one year now. I have had seven leg surgeries, including knee replacement. This product is an absolute dream. Just stick it to the bottom of your tub, wet it, pour a little liquid soap(body wash soap)and while you are showering, just rub your foot over the soapy soles. They work up a rich lather which works up between you toes. You can turn your feet at different angles to get the sides and heels of your feet.The Soapy Soles are and absolute pleasure and they massage your feet.If you are handicapped, no someone who is or have any problem bathing, whether on a bath bench or standing in a shower.......when you can't reach your feet....Soapy Soles does the trick. I highly recommned them."
2,Leave it Behind!!!,"...these books are poorly written. I read through the first two books in record time, but this was just the same thing repeated over and over again. There comes a time when enough is enough. I'd recommend the first book in the series and probably the second. But don't waste your time going beyond that."
5,Nicolae,I love the entire series. After reading the first one (book one) I just had to read all. Great buy.
5,Can't put this series down!,I'm in love with this series. I picked up the first book on accident not even realizing it was a series and I've been hooked ever since. Keeps you engaged the whole time.
3,nicolae,The next book doesn't disappoint. It is super full of suspense and you won't be able to sit still. I sure didn't.
3,Fast Delivery But A Little Disappointed,"Delivery is fast, got it in less than 7 days after I placed my order in the web. I am a little disappointed with the quality, it did not look the way I expect it to be, nevertheless, service is excellent. I suggest for a more detailed description and picture that depicts the true condition or appearance of the product being sold. Thanks."
4,"Still a good series, but too much repetition in this one...","Although I think this series is well written and interesting, for the most part, this book in the series reiterates too many of the facts that have already been stated. If you don't know what is going on, go back and read the first two books again, don't take up 100 pages telling us what Rayford has done wrong, what Buck has seen and done before, etc."
4,Another chapter in a great story,"There is not a whole lot to say about this book as a standalone. It is not likely that anyone will read this without the reading the previous books. I liked this one probably as much as the previous two. A great story with a fast ""movie-of-the-week"" feel. A quick, enjoyable read, but hardly landmark literature. I will, however, continue to read the series."
2,Fun story ....badly written,I started this series because of my friend's recommendation. The story is compelling at times but these books are very poorly written. It is sometimes tough to continue reading. The characters are not well developed or believable. The women...don't get me started...the women are so simplistic and unnecessary. It is shameful that the female characters are portrayed as such silly people. There is something about these books despite the many flaws that keep me reading. My husband and I enjoy talking about them and comparing the pre-tribulation theory to our own faith.
5,Captivating!!!,"LaHaye and Jenkins have continued a masterful, though fiction, account of the last days. The Scripturally-based story is thought provoking and has caused me, once again, to consider the ramifications of current events today. I highly recommend this series, and this book! I ended it hoping there was another!"
2,Most interesting character is the car,"I just went to the Los Angeles Auto Show found myself drawn to the Land Rover/Range Rover exhibition because this amazing vehicle has near super powers in the Left Behind series, particularly in Nicolae. The blessed Range Rover consistently delivers Buck from one certain-death situation to another, yet always spirits him away unscathed. This is clearly the unstoppable vehicle to own during the tribulation. Thanks to authors LaHaye and Jenkins and their persuasive brand placement, I'm buying Range Rover from now on, extravagant price be damned!"
1,HATE FICTION,"Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!!!"
1,Skip it! Wait for the last one.,"Same song, third verse. It's like standing up through fifteen choruses of ""Just As I Am"" while the evangelist begs and pleads for someone to respond. Wait for the movie. At least then you can get it all for 8 bucks."
2,"Confession of a ""Left Behind"" junkie, and a warning","While this is certainly an interesting interpretation of end times, the characters are ineffably disappointing in their two-dimensionality. I don't believe them, nor do I really care about them. The dialogue is dispensible, and I found myself skipping pages of dialogue just to get to the next plot element. Yet, to my shame, I am hooked on the books and will probably read them all.Reader, please beware: Bible scholars have debated to no agreement on the time of the Rapture relative to other end time prophecies. While the Rapture may come before the Tribulation (HOPEFULLY!), it also may not! Be ready to endure it and be FIRM on your foundation in Jesus!"
3,"Dragged in Places, But Still a Good Read","This third book in the Left Behind Series dragged a bit in places, but that's OK-you can't expect every book in a long series to be equally good ! Part of the reason it draggged is that there was some summarizing of previous books added in for readers who may have picked up this book without seeing the former books. Even so, don't skip this book, because some important things happen, and you need to know those things for the following books.For me, the most interesting thing in this book was Nicolae's ongoing relationship with Hattie, and what happens with that."
3,Expected more from from ole nick,"I eagerly bought Nicolae with the expectation of it to be fast moving and for it to delve more deeply into his evil,but it just didn't happen.then half way thru the book it stalled out with a recap of what's happened in the two previous books.I'm sorry gentleman,but I had already read them and did not need a reminder.I had thought that with the title,Nicolae would come to the forefront as the anti-christ,instead of taking a back seat to the heroes of the story.I still don't know anything about the character,other than he's the anti-christ.I don't know what is in store for the crew and will keep reading the rest of the series,but I was disappointed in Nicolae."
3,"Good idea, but thin on style.","I love the story line and where the series is heading, but LaHaye and Jenkins need to slow down and develope the characters a little more and juice up the dialogue and make it more realistic. There's a novel out there called, 'The Fist of God' by A.T Nicholas. It will blow you away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The plot is awesome, and Nicholas has a fresh twist on the old storyline of good against evil. His chapters and writing style is fast and slick, he gets to the point quick, he packs the book with rich symbolism and vivid imagery. And the dialogue between characters is realistic. I loved it! You will too."
2,Slowest of the first three,"Though the story (I guess I should say prophecy yet to be fullfilled) brings the reader deeper into the mire of earthly doom, Nicolae (book 3 of 7) is the slowest so far.For a novel that is 415 pages long, I felt it could have moved at a much faster pace. Don't get me wrong, there are at least 2 exciting moments in the book that were real page turners, but the other 350 pages dragged on. It does help further along some character development and their are a few interesting sub plots, but I look forward to the 4th, for it appears now things are about to pick up for the Tribulation Force and the forces of good and evil.My only real complaint is some of the hokey dialouge. I consider myself christian, and yet I don't hear people talk like the characters do in real lide. The dialouge is at times, campy, like June and Ward Cleaver. If the end times are upon us, reality would be much harsher than portrayed here.I give this book 2 1/2 stars."
3,Gripping second half!,"The first half of this book was slow and seamless. Compare to ""Left Behind"", ""Nicolae"" was a much more disappointing read. However, the second half of the novel picks up speed. The escape from Isreal and the description of the ""Wrath of the Lamb"" were very exciting and put me at the edge of my seat. Although the writing was rather weak, the novelists leaves the readers with a profound image of what is to come and a lot to think about."
