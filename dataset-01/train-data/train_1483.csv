2,Movie/Novel Same-Same---Not a Good Thing,"If you've seen the movie then you've read the book. If you read the book then you've seen the movie. They are almost word for word, scene for scene. I saw the movie first and thought it a bore-fest; too long by 60 minutes easy. Then reading the book I thought it was too long by a good 100 pages. But you really only need one or the other, or sadly, neither. Yes the writing is very good, and yes the directing, acting and overall production values of the movie are good as well. But is it entertaining? Only so far. My recommendation, do one or the other, but not both."
2,Why a novel?,A novel about a historical figure? It works if you don't know anything about J. James. Otherwise it is just fluff.
5,One of the two best Western novels ever,"I agree with the reviewers who laud Mr. Hansen's superb novel and give it five stars. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is sprawling and precise, Shakespeare out of Camus crossed with Peckinpah. I don't think that the book is too detailed or slow, as one reader reports. I think that the detail helps make the book what it is: An absolutely convincing account of the men and the times, taut all the way, and not romanticized. In my opinion, there are two great novels of the American West that transcend the genre and become real literature:Elizabeth Fackler's ""Billy The Kid: The Legend of El Chivato,"" and this novel about Jesse James and Bob Ford by Mr. Hansen."
4,"Superb prose, but too much of a good thing?","Hansen is an exemplary wordsmith and this is a wonderfully written book. Steeped in vivid detail and obviously painstaking research, it's enlightening and informative. If it fails at all its in its excesses. Can there be too much detail? Too deep an examination of the people and events surrounding the principal players? Unfortunately the answer is ""yes,"" and those excesses make this book a tough, slow read. The fine quality of the writing, however, will certainly make up for some of the lapses in storytelling for many readers, especially those with higher literary standards."
5,You'll know Jesse by the end of the 1st paragraph,"Following one of the best lead paragraphs ever written, a story unfolds into a definitive biography of Jesse James by a master writer. Hansen's works are literary masterpieces. He deals with fact and clears up fiction in a brilliant writing style, and transports you into the life of Jesse James. A must for every serious student of outlaw history"
3,Fell apart...,"I got this for Christmas years ago from a friend, and soon after I got it his head fell off when he fell off my TV stand and hit the floor. Soon after that the sword broke.Not very durable, so just be careful with it and it should remain intact."
3,spare...tire...,"It's ""there when I need it"" for my 3 wheeler bike. Higher pressure-for the ""road"" riding I do. Wears well also."
4,pretty darn good,well i dont think it should be used as the main way to learn the kana.. i think this should be used withJapanese Katakana for Beginners: First Steps to Mastering the Japanese Writing System (Tuttle Language Library) (Japanese Edition)andJapanese Hiragana for Beginners: First Steps to Mastering the Japanese Writing System (Japanese Edition)definitely great practice.. plus its got quite a few vocab words in it..
2,Won't Fit 2002 Ford F-350 Super Duty,"Received mud flaps today and they are not made for my F350 but rather a smaller model Ford truck; perhaps an F150 or F250. Had to modify installation.Also, Amazon told me via email that these are sold individually so I ordered two (2) - one for each back tire. They arrived today and they are sold as a set of two (2) so I now have four (4) and I only needed two (2). Can you say cha-ching?"
5,Power amp for the water,"This Pyle amp for my boat was more than a surprise. For the cost, it really rocks to boat. I'm glad I didn't drop and waste $400 on a bigger name brand. Even the guy at Best Buy was pleased w/ it's performance."
1,"""Pyle"" of junk","I bought this amp because I wanted to save a little money. Not only is the power overrated, but each channel bleeds over into the other channels. When I hook up just one RCA connector, I can hear the music in all of the speakers.My (50Wx4 peak) Pioneer head unit alone sounds better than this amp. Don't buy it. I plan to audition a JBL or Rockford Fosgate."
3,"Decent unit for the money, nice size","This does what it needs to do. Isn't going to blow anyone's clothes off, but you get audio from 4 channels. Seems like it's about 20-28 watts RMS per channel. Wish it had more power."
2,What a disappointment!,"The book itself is okay. Some of the explanations could use a bit of rethinking, but on the whole the exposition is quite useful. However, the accompanying material on the CD is totally useless. Worse, it is dangerous to the health of your computer to try to play the attached movies. My computer totally froze on either of them. It wouldn't play them with any of my four video players, including VLC which plays almost anything and can repair broken movies."
2,cute but not durable,"This is an attractive watch, but my daughter brought it home in pieces after her first day wearing it. It wasn't very comfortable, either."
3,cremation & other end-of-life cycle choices,This will be reviewed in detail after I've applied its info to choose from among alternatives to grave plots and cemeteries.
5,"A History of the Crusades, Volume II: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187","All three volumes of this historical work are written extremely well. They are very enjoyable to read. Sir Runciman's observations and personal conclusions are well reasoned and seem unprejudiced. These volumes (3)are among the most enjoyable works I have read on the history of the crusades, I recommend them to anyone interested in a realistic but balanced look at the Crusades and their contributions to Western Civilization as well as their problematic execution. Pax Tecum Fr Bill"
4,Solid History,"I am not sure if it was the subject matter, but I enjoyed this book more than the other two in the trilogy. This one focused on the high tide of the Crusader States and shows them in all their glory and shame. The political manueverings of the Crusaders, the Western Europeans and the Muslims was quite interesting. I knew little of this period before reading these books and was confused at some points. A little foreknowledge might be helpful."
1,Not happy,"I ordered this book twice, especially because the picture shows the book with a blue cover which is the Cambridge Press edition.The books I received were not from Canbridge Press and did not have the Appendix III which is the genealogy. These books came from paperbackshop in England. I feel that the genealogy is a very important part of this book and should always be included."
4,"good, fresh when delivered","Rated 4 stars due to scanty amount of walnuts. Thought all My Grandma's were made the same. Previous supplier's cakes did contain more walnuts.Will try another order. Perhaps last shipment was a fluke.Good service, packaging and freshWould recommend to someone less fussy than I."
4,"Good animation, weak plot","Hey, it's eye candy. The plot was a reach, and the voices seemed out of place. But overall, it was worth the $$."
2,I have to agree,"I agree with the another reviewer that the amp hook up wire is certainly not 8 AWG. After I stripped the insulation off one end, I pulled it through my stripper's 12 gauge size hole and there was no drag at all. Pyle should be ashamed to claim this bogus gauge size. It is beyond borderline fraudulent! I should have known better due to the price compared to others. As the previous reviewer said, the rest of the items look pretty good."
1,not as advertised,I should have read the other reviews! The power wire actual cooper is just about 1/2 the size of the REAL 8 gage wire I had left over from a previous install. I cut this power wire in half and soldered the ends together to create a single wire from the combined halves. This served as my ground as I re-used my original 8 gage power wire. The speaker wire was also smaller than advertised. Looks like lamp-cord. I used the wire but I am unhappy with the actual gage and will eventually replace it. The cable ends didn't crimp well and I used a set from my local marina.Would not reccomend!
2,ok for the price,I purchased this product thinking it would be easy to install. The speaker wire I didn't use. The ground wire I didn't use. The red power wire barely fit. If you have a boat bigger than 21 feet I would be skeptical that you probably don't have enough positive wire. The screws that come with this package are use less. Better off buying the wires and connections individually
1,Not What I ordered,What I ordered was water based condom and what I received was dry. Water was the lubricant. There seems to be a disconnect it what is shown when searching and finding the needed product and what is actually processed. I would like a refund or please ship the water based durex condoms.
4,A delightful new account,"Though not a revelatory version of the 2nd, Alsop's presentation sweeps along beautifully and shimmers in all the right places. Perhaps she meanders a bit in the Adagio, but I find much to relish in Alsop's pacing and lyricism. This is a nice new version of one of my favorite (perhaps my favorite) symphonies, and I have revisited it several times. If you love Brahms, I think you will find much to enjoy in this new recording!"
3,"A decent ""analytical"" interpretation","Alsop provides an extremely clear reading of the score. The balance and delineation between the separate stages of exposition and development in the first movement was especially impressive, and highlights the complexity of Brahms' sonata form. Her treatment of both the miniature thematic developments and the extended harmonic tensions of the second movement is also excellent. The tempos are appropriately ponderous, and I have never so well appreciated the tonal continuity between this work and the Clarinet Quintet.(I agree with some previous reviews, that this interpretation may not be suitable to a beginner looking for a racy interpretation. But I strongly dislike Karajan's interpretation of this particular symphony. To readers looking for a more exciting interpretation I recommend Eugen Jochum on DG)."
2,If you like it slow...,"...then this is the contemporary Brahms' Second for you. A worthy heir to the Bernstein tradition. Quite ponderous. Don't listen late at night and expect to make it to the end. (On occasion, that's a good thing, hence the second star.) If you must own every recording of Brahms' Second, then you must buy this one. If you are relatively new to the work, start with a von Karajan, for example the DG re-mastering of the early 60's performances of the Second and the Third."
3,Too lyrical,"Alsop's interpretation of Brahms #2 is sensitive and nicely phrased, but it is almost too lyrical. What that means in musical terms is that she does not allow for any pauses between phrases, or for enough contrast between them. Each one seamlessly blends into the next, which gives this performance a cinematic quality, almost as if it were background music to a lovely period film set in the 19th century English countryside. Occasionally it rains, but in general it is sunny and mild. That being said, you can listen to this performance with only half an ear and appreciate it while you are doing something else. But if you want to listen with your whole ear, I would recommend the Solti recording with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (Decca). It has the right blend of lyricism and fire. Or, if you would rather forget your ear entirely, and simply go for your gut, try John Eliot Gardiner's earth-moving peformance. The last movement will knock your socks off."
1,Go elsewhere,"The serious, self-important facial expression of the conductor on the front of the CD jewelcase is a dead giveaway of the musical treatment you are about to experience. The Brahms 2nd Symphony shouldn't be played like the 1st or 4th. After all, it's Brahms' ""pastoral"" symphony. Yet Maestra Alsop attempts to turn it into some sort of ""profound statement"", when she should just chill and let the music play. Brahms doesn't need this sort of treatment.The Hungarian Dances are forgettable -- go instead with Neeme Jarvi, Antal Dorati or Paul Strauss for some real kick-up-your-heels excitement."
1,Doesn't work,"This will not hold a bike up even on level concrete with no wind, in a bldg. It WILL tip to the side, if you can get it to even balance in the first place. I hate the hassle of sending stuff back, so will try mounting on 2x4's to make the base wider."
1,Piece of Junk! AVOID,"We bought this product locally. I should have checked the reviews on Amazon first. It's Garbage.It doesn't support the bikes properly - to get it to work at all is a real balancing act.After a week or so, the arms bow out and excessive pressure is put on the spokes. Eventually, if you don't have the bike balanced exactly right. It fails and the bike falls over.A complete waste of money.I'm forced to give it 1 star as you can't give something ZERO stars!"
1,Not worth the money,Made of cheap plastic and will not support the weight of my mountain bike. I should have read the reviews on this before buying it.Don't waste your time or money
1,Basically worthless as a bike support,Unfortunately this device does not work. It is just a piece of cheap plastic and unless your bike weighs less than perhaps 5 lbs it most likely will fall over. Amazon is a great (.com) company and should remove this worthless product from their inventory. The wheel arch is totally unstable and from the photos it looks sturdy but do not be fooled I think you may be sorry you purchased it. I am amazed at many of the other reviews that are positive but I do not know if they use it to support a kids tricycle or toy.
5,conscious music for people who love music and humanity.,"This album's variations in flow and stlye, coupled with it's brave,enlightened lyrics is a must have! This album is a beautiful work of art. Michael Franti has his finger on the pulse of the world and has translated our cries for justice into a wonderful collection of tunes. No filler here!"
5,Simply Incredible,"Listen to Every Single Soul, and this review becomes immediately unnecessary.I have never encountered an artist who packs so much beauty, warmth, and wisdom into every one of his songs. This CD is, in many ways, a self help book. If you can live as these songs instruct, you'll be happy and fulfilled.Franti's style of non-confrontational teaching and storytelling creates an amazing lyrical style atop relaxed, funky, and joyful beats. No matter how deep the subject matter, you never walk away from these songs feeling anything less then relaxed and at ease.Michael Franti has managed to create the first Aural Meditation. Now, please stop reading my review and buy the album."
3,It's okay,"This is more a dramatic performance than a music CD. The radio segments in between each song are good the first time you listen to it, but after that it gets old. The music is good and Michael Franti has a great voice."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"The music on this album is great and I have been looking for it for a while, however the version I received was ""Spearhead Radio"" version with a bunch of short talking tracks in between songs which I don't like. The version of ""Oh My God"" is also different from the one I have been looking for."
4,Mostly great,"The music on this album is amazing, and the message is right-on. In fact this is probably Franti's best ever album when judged from the viewpoint of music, lyrics, and message.Unfortunately I found the radio broadcast segments to be ill-conceived and intrusive, but they are easily skipped.The ""music fan"" who praised Stay Human but only gave it 1 star because of objections to who Franti chooses to give political support to needs to learn more about the Mumia Abu-Jamal case, which is nowhere near as cut & dried as their post suggests. The trial transcripts don't tell the whole story - the whole point is that this was considered an unfair and biased trial. Dig a little deeper and you'll find plenty to question."
3,depends on you...,"I suppose many people like this CD as a whole. Political Ideas, and Music. I think its important to realize the dual nature of this music.You may;1)like the politics, and the music.2)like the politcs, but not the music.3)not like the politics, or the music.4)not like the politics, but like the music.Politically, this man is obviously passionate. Although I disagree with many aspects of his ideologies (if he truly has any), I can agree with some of his ideas. I think this guy is a little understudied, but hightly attentive. Better than most people though!Musically. Not surprising to me. I didnt get alot out of this bands sound, instrumentation, or arrangments. Very- Verse Chorus- stuff. Nice in areas, but not the meat of their appeal.I dont know. Maybe youll love it. Alot of people do."
2,Wonderful music ruined by awful lyrics,"I shouldn't be shocked really. Their debut album ""Home"" had the same problem.I get sick everytime I see a reviewer call Michael Franti's lyrics positive, they're just the same, boring, worn out, PC cliches that he's been spouting for many years.Nothing quite reaches the whiney, socialist awfulness of their debut's _Crime to Be Broke in America_ but then again, not much here is any better.Dr Octagon released an insturmental version of their album, why can't Franti do the decent thing and do the same with Spearhead?"
5,Stay Human,For all the funky people in the the world.... peace!Get out there and Rock the Nation. Be part of the Solution!
5,"A true classic from an indefinable, consummate composer.","While the songs on this album are by far some of the smoothest, most engaging pieces constructed by Richard D. James, this is an album few fans ever get the chance to listen to. It is confined to the import bins under hefty price tags, and it is deserving of a far greater audience. Even those that have never heard any Aphex Twin are won over by this album. The textures are almost lovingly crafted, the beats divinely placed; this is an album for everyone. There are not enough stars in this system for this album."
4,Songs In The Key of Ambience,"Richard D. James has put together a solid collection of sounds on this release. On some Aphex Twin releases, it will take a couple of listens before the music sets in. It's not always instant gratification and some recordings require repeated listens to finally get what the artist is going for. Personally, I felt that the music jumps out on this. For example, ""Xtal"" is a wonderful opener with these vocals that sounds very ethereal. It's got this heavenly vibe that is very pleasing to the ears. My favorite would have to be ""Ageispolis"" because the bassline is so playful and the ambience is so fulfilling. ""Heliosphan"" is another gem that gets heavy rotation. The whole album is excellent, however, there are some parts that drags and doesn't quite hold up. Overall, this is a great listen and a must for Aphex Twin fans."
4,One of the greats,RDJs finest ever committed to CD. Some of these tracks are not ambient per se but given that some of these tracks are recorded when Richie was only 14 it really does make the jaw drop as the CD and the songs are all magnificent. Worth paying your money for
4,Great Ambient Music,"All the reviewers here say it right -- it's ambient, it's timeless, it's great music! I was looking for modern drum & bass and picked this up at my friend's recommendation -- I had no idea it was so old, even after listening to it! It's very mellow and laid back, alien, and easy to get into. Highly recommend it to trance and dance enthusiasts, but by itself it's not dancing music."
5,Thoughts of Home,Another great book by Troy Taylor. He always brings in such interesting facts and history of a place. I have learned a lot from his books especially those on Central Illinois where I grew up. This book is an inspiration for would be ghost hunters too. Gives a lot of ideas to get them started hunting.
1,False Advertising,"Hosa 15 Neutrik Speakon to Banana Plug Speaker Cable, 14 AWG, with 2 ConductorsNotice that under the Product Features section, it says ""50-Feet length."" They LIE! It's 15 feet. Don't get fooled. This is the first time I didn't get what I was expecting, and only the second time ever, that I'm returning something. I'll have to figure out how to do that..."
5,Correction!,"This is not really a review but a correction to Popkulcher's review. The Connells have NOT broken up! True, touring has taken a backseat to families and dayjobs, but the Connells are still making music and playing the occasional local or regional show. In fact, they are working on material for a new album! So don't give up on The Connells just yet."
5,It takes underground to root,"Yes, the production isn't up to date. Thank God. No polished, digitalized, computer-supported, expensively mastered kind of record. Still the grounded production fits the music just perfectly, adding the last detail to those jangling, bittersweet sixties vibes that emphasize on what is so often lost in up-to-date-records: a good song. With all the multimedia-stuff around us nowadays, the Connells trace the old path, with a knowing smile, slowly but steadily. Buy this record and support a band that has always been an outpost of integrity and hum their new songs when you're on your way home from work, with a window open and a mild springtime breeze swirling your hair."
3,Great songs but terrible production,"I don't know if I'd go so far as to describe ""Old School Dropouts"" as ""an unfortunate mess,"" but it is hugely dissapointing compared to anything they've done for the last ten years or so solely because the production and engineering is so badly done. Drums sound hollow, voices sound weak, and more often than not when you expect to hear a crisp clear sound, you end up with a fuzzy, meandering one - and vice versa. It's a shame, because the songs themselves are more or less up to standard - Mike Connell hasn't lost the art for a good tune - but it takes perseverence to get through the album when they're not given the right air to breathe in. A real missed opportunity."
1,An unfortunate mess,"Was hugely disappointed in this one. The engineering is remarkably bad for a band who has been putting out good music for as long as the Connells. There are other strangely mixed albums in their catalog (Boylan Heights), but those other albums at least have the plus of having great songs on them.The Connells have tarnished their legacy with this one, Still Life was a masterpiece... I hope they have one more in them!"
2,Might be harsh but...,"I don't know folks.... this one might have to take a place next to my rarely listened to copy of ""weird food""."
2,"Love the Connells, but please, this is just Bad","All the glowing reviews for what is basically a horrible CD are simply a true testament to the power the Connells have over their loyal fans. These guys, at the best, were awesome songwriters and are my favorite live band. However, this album is just terrible. I bought it when released, TRIED to like it and finally trashed it. Eevn Weird Food was better than this, and they have never done better than Fun & Games. I hope they are still together - and can get the drummer back who did quit - so they can end on a brighter note than this dismal piece of crap."
5,Raga,"This is an incredibly beautiful, informative and moving film. It was originally produced by the Beatles' Apple Corps in the early 1970s, but the visual and audio quality of the DVD is superb. It is only available in the US and having it imported through Amazon to the UK was not cheap, but for anyone devoted to or inquisitive about Indian classical music, this film is priceless. An added bonus are the MP3 tracks based on the DVD which can be downloaded free of charge with every purchase."
5,A Must See,"This is a must see for any Ravi fan and indeed for any fan of yoga, kirtan, or Indian music.A brief appearance from George Harrison is interesting as an historical point and shows how the sitar made it across into western music.I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in World Music as well as those who would identify with any of the categories above.Hari Om to the maestro, Ravi Shankar."
5,The definitive book for the Baja side of the SOC,"This book is very in depth with excellent drawings and photos but is almost entirely about the Baja peninsula side of the Sea of Cortez - if you are looking for the mainland side SOc info, the Cunningham books are bibles for that territory."
5,Every time it sounds newer.,"What I am amazed at about this CD is that it sounds newer every time I listen to it. I like Handel's music played with original instruments, but I cannot expect I can listen to it ten times without feeling bored. But it is not the case with this CD. You can listen to it many times without being bored. No. The more you listen to it, the more you will find in it which makes it new, deep and great. Listening to this CD, I cannot stop admiring the greatness of Handel, and that of Bernstein."
5,housewives from hell,the story about these friends shows why you need to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. wish show was still active.
5,How I miss them already.,"I brought the first DHW's for re sell and got bored and decided to watch it. Eight seasons later I was hooked (Lynette's my favorite), so I finally brought the last season (which made me cry), It was great a clear ending to some super lives on tv. Bree, Gabby. Lynette, Susan, Renee, Mike Carlos (so sexy), Tom (sexy too), I'm going to miss them all. Well atleast I can re watch all my 8 seasons."
5,As Usual .Gr8,Good Release And Great TV Show with lovely castsadly its the last season .tv glory at its best
4,Farewell Wisteria Lane,"Series Finale: May 13, 2012Ah ""Desperate Housewives"". The time has finally come to an end. Now what I am going to do on Sunday nights? This show has managed to keep me entertained now for eight seasons with enough twist, turns, and drama to make me dizzy.I enjoyed this season. I feel that the series ""went out"" while it still had a good, solid fan base. Even though this was the last season it was NOT short on Mystery, humor, and the ever present drama that we all love. The finale showed exactly what I wanted to see, which was how the writers were going to conclude the story-lines of the four main characters: Susan, Lynette, Bree and Gaby and I was not disappointed.As much as I enjoyed this show, all good things must come to an end sadly, this was ""Desperate Housewives"" time. Wisteria Lane will live on now through DVD'S."
5,"""Great Show""",Sad that it has now ended! I love those gals and I just did not want it to end and those gals are awesome! I loved everythingabout the show and their lifestyle... funny and enjoyable. going to really miss them.
5,Desperate,"Loved Desperate house wives from the very first time it was broadcast on ABC , so sad when it was ended."
1,Desperate Housewives Eighth and Final Season,"When we received this video, the cover was cracked and does not hold shut, the paper and plastic over was torn and folded over. This was a gift so I am not happy with the outer packaging. The disc was fine."
4,Does the job. Solid Construction.,"I bought one of these and a Sumiko HS-12. I'd prefer the Sumiko if it was only twice the price, but it's five times the price and that's just too crazy a spread. The Litz wire makes a difference on a new cartridge, but I'd seriously doubt that it would on a vintage cartridge. I own three Sumikos now and that'll probably be the last purchase, as they've just become too expensive. This is a good alternative."
4,Low cost alternative to Technics headshell,"No problems, and right price! I have several of these and they work fine and dandy in my SL1200 MkII."
3,Does the job.,"This headshell does the job, but I'd say it's a fair bit heavier than the stock headshell, and worse yet, the azimuth is very slightly off, which can be a problem depending on your stylus/cartridge/arm combo. I'd get another product next time."
3,If you like the Cowboy Junkies' Trinity Sessions . .,"A good CD with a country feel and a lot owed to Enncino Morricone. Nothing matches ""Our First Drunken"", which is by far the best track, but the music is excellent. The voice often leaves something to be desired."
5,Devil's Food is delicious!,"Though I can see how some readers may feel uncomfortable about reading the passages about Frank's sorrow over his dying wife, I'll have to say that Tony Bruno is a warm kind human to be abel to deal with this issue of dying family members with taste and heart. The rest of the novel is just too good to describe, without at least doing it severe injustice. Just grab yourself a copy of this baby and enjoy! Mamma Mia!"
4,From the cover:,"From the back cover:The collaborative work o a biblical scholar and a biology professor, this book addresses scripture passages relating to homosexuality and explains the foundation of genetics and the growing evidence suggesting an organic basis for sexual orientation. The authors argue that ""the role of the homosexual, as well as the heterosexual, within the church should be based upon common criteria for all."" Written in a highly accessible manner, the book is idea for congregational discussion."
2,Let's feel sorry for the victim,"As I read Judith Moore's book, I cried and laughed in recognition. I was disgusted and appalled at how close she hit home. Most of all, she made me angry. For those of us who are fat, husky, or large, we are not pitiful creatures. We are not defined only by our size. That is one part of who we are. Yes, my weight has shaped who I am today, but I have chosen who I am as much as my parents have molded me. I love food and I eat it. Fat people are not people who walk around thinking we just can't help it. It is very simple. If you don't eat, you will lose weight. God knows it's not easy, but it is a choice you make. This little rule applies to Judith Moore too.This memoir is soaked with self-pity and Judith Moore fancies herself as the martyr of fat people."
1,This woman needs counseling . . .,"not a forum for spreading her poisonous thoughts and emotions to the public. She needs to recover from her self-hatred instead of assuming that other fat people feel the same sense of shame that she does. The truth is that a lot of us fat folks have careers, wear great clothes that fit, have happy relationships, and aren't obsessed with losing weight. In other words, we have a life! I hope that Judith Moore finds a good therapist and gets the help she obviously needs."
1,"Dull, whiny, just GET OVER IT!","You only have to read the first chapter of this book to get the whole feel of it. Yes, she was fat. Yes, she was abused. You know what, Ms. Moore? So were millions of other kids. All you wanted was a loving, happy family? Yes, so do millions of other kids.Other reviewers say this book is intense and raw: maybe so, but I also think it was boring and full of self-hatred. Why waste time reading something like that?"
2,Fat Girl Book,"I ordered this book along with the Hollywood 24-Hour Miracle diet. The book was packed in the same box with the 3 bottles of the liquid diet. One of the 3 bottles of the Hollywood Diet broke open and leaked all over the box and ruined the book. I returned the book with the one open bottle of the diet and the 2 unopened bottles of the diet. In the future your employees should pack liquid items securely and separately from other items so they do not move all over the box and break open ruining the other items that are shipped with the liquid items.I received full credit for my return of this book. However, I originally requested another copy of the book but unfortunately it was out of stock. I ordered the book from another company."
3,"Vividly Candid, but Depressing....","Concurring with a previous reviewer, I am glad this book was such a quick read, or I doubt I would have finished it. It seems that Ms. Moore wrote this book as a cathartic attempt to ""cleanse"" her mind and soul of her appalling upbringing. Having grown up as a ""fat"" child, I can certainly identify and attest to the cruelty of children, as well as adults, with their cruel and unthinking remarks towards someone who doesn't fit the norm. Even though I went from the proverbial ugly duckling to a ""semi-swan"", I still think of myself as fat, and probably always will."
3,Easy read but not what I expected.,"This is a short read (under 200 pages) that starts slow and ends abrupt. While the chronicles of the author's fat childhood are fascinating, the teenage years are mostly ignored (arguably the most volatile for an overweight female). Also, there are long and distracting lists of food scattered repeatedly throughout that make it hard to concentrate on the plot.Mostly this book was about how the author hated herself (more than the people she encountered). The reason, being fat, could have easily been substituted with any other problem people face."
4,Very honest look at one person's life,"Ms. Moore shares with readers her deepest feelings and realizations of growing up overweight in a dysfunctional family. Opening the closed door behind which the abuse occurs, survivors like the author are refusing to stay victims. Dealing with her self-esteem issues and family dynamics, she portrays her life unflinchingly."
2,Unhappy childhood makes for unhappy book,"This book totally depressed me. The cover and the blurbs did not provide clues to the true nature of the book. The author seems to dislike herself, and that comes through page after page. It was well written, but the story was simply too bleak."
3,Fat Girl,"As an person of substantial size, I was interested in this book. Judith Moore does capture the trials of an overweight child trying to fit into a thin world. She certainly faces a lot of discrimination as she grows up. She is not supported by her family...only pushed further into an abyss that helps to create the fat person. The use of four letter words seems unnecessary to me, and detracts from the real story."
2,"Very sad, painful read","This is one of the saddest books I've ever read. I'm usually okay with sad, especially when there's a great lesson or a happy ending. I picked this book up because I thought I would get a better understanding of how very overweight people feel and how they live there lives day to day. I was way off on that - what I got was a terribly depressing detailed account of a horribly abusive and neglectful childhood. The only plus about this book is that it is a very quick read so you can get it over with quickly."
3,A cautionary tale: Self loathing will never go away on its own,"It's not that it was fun to read. If you hate yourself, you have to make your self-loathing funny to pull off an entertaining memoir. This was purely sad, not funny. But the pain, the MEANNESS, undramatic but unrelenting, she was surrounded by, still haunts me. So I know it was well-written. But not necessarily enjoyable."
5,Excellent,"This is a poignant and very well-written memoir. I was touched by the brutal honesty of it. I would discourage you to think the book is only about being fat though. It's a memoir and a very moving one. It doesn't have a happy ending or a hopeful message and I appreciate that kind of honesty.I've always been overweight too but did not have the same type of problems as Judith Moore. Still, in our society it is so easy to learn to hate our own bodies and that is what I have often done. So what if not every fat person has the same story? I'm glad she wrote hers and shared it with me.I would read other books by Judith Moore. I like her voice and style."
3,"Great start, faltered toward the end","I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. It started out as a sad look into the everyday life of a fat person, then meandered through her depressing life story. I was glad I read this book, but thought it had a poor finish."
3,A Wonderful Story,"This is a wonderful and touching story about a girl growing up overweight who struggles not only with body issues, but also a crazy grandmother, an abusive mother, and a neglectful father. When I first started reading the book I couldn't put it down, that is until I reached a few boring chapters in the middle of the book. Although this is a great story, I think in a few chapters it focuses too much on her parent's parents... which gets a little boring, but not for long. After that the book takes you right back into it, with its sad, yet sometimes funny story. This is a must read for everyone."
3,Have read better autobiographies.,"This book was okay, but I enjoyed Augusten Burroughs books more. I understand that the author was fat and enjoyed food, but I almost felt like I was reading a food critique in a magazine. Her constant descriptions of fat and food made this book boring. I was more interested in her life story and how it drove her to eat more than the constant vivid descriptions of the food she liked and how her body appeared. I think that I am an emotional eater and have battled weight problems all my life and was expecting to be able to relate and to get more out of the book. I was sad that there was no real ending and it appeared that she just wrote the book to let out her frustrations. There was not a real meaning in the story I did not feel."
2,Pass,"In her memoir of growing up fat, Moore, who previously wrote about food in Never Eat Your Heart Out, employs her edgy, refreshingly candid voice to tell the story of a little girl who weighed 112 pounds in second grade; whose father abandoned her to a raging, wicked mother straight out of the Brothers Grimm; whose lifelong dieting endeavors failed as miserably as her childhood attempts to find love at home. The book does have some high points, especially while Moore is stashed at the home of a kind uncle who harbors his own secrets, but the happiest moments are tinged with dread. Moore cuts her story short after briefly touching on an unsatisfying reunion with her father and her two failed marriages. The ending feels hurried, but perhaps the publication of this book will give Moore's story the happy ending she deserves"
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","Just read this book for our monthly book club selection only 1 person out of 15 liked the book. The rest of us thought it was annoying, boring and just wanted the author to stop complaining."
4,Surprisingly Moving,"This book, mostly a recounting of the author's youth, was harsh, yet poignant at times. It certainly is not a hook to read over a meal! Despite the way food is lushly described, the stark images of obesity swiftly turned even those beautiful descriptions into nausea. I did enjoy reading it, though, Brief and powerful, it certainly was a unique sort of memoir. While ultimately depressing, the word choices carried no small amounts of beauty. And though her audience is told that it is too late to love her, you can't help but feel like she has become someone you know well over the course of the book."
1,More offensive stereotypes of fat women,"What a piece of fat-hating self-loathing garbage. Judith Moore desperately needs intense therapy. I don't think I could put it any better than the others who have only rated this piece of trash one star--I would've given it zero stars but that option is unavailable. Ms. Moore, please do everyone a BIG favor (no pun intended) and keep your opinions of fat people to yourself from now on. The world will be a lot better off if you do. Awful. Avoid at all costs."
4,Courageous and Painful,"I selected this book at an airport because I wanted something short to read on a long flight. I was amazed I had not heard of this memori before! I could not put this book down and found Judith's words and her style courageous.I think the other reviewers have touched on what this memoir is very well, but I wanted to put my voice her as well. This memoir is worth a read for anyone. I am glad to see that a thin person reviewed it as well as heavy people. As a person who has struggled with my weight and body image for most my life I felt particularly drawn to the title and the story within.Judith is strong to put down on paper the blunt truth about her situation. She went through a lot of pain and continues to work on herself. She does not ask for pity or forgiveness, but at the very least I hope everyone can find some compassion for the heavy people they see on the street.I highly recommend this memoir."
1,Disappointing book,I thought this book would have more resolution but instead it's an insult to women.
2,This isn't talent!,"As a fat girl myself I am very disappointed by this book. I was expecting a story and instead I got a bunch of ramblings. This book doesn't make sense.As soon as Moore started describing an interesting situation that got my attention, she stopped abruptly and changed topic. This is not a talented writer. This is a woman who knows her vocabulary and decided to show it off. What a waste of time, reading a page and a half about a cheeseburger. How about describing this man who was so rude and offensive, instead of a darn burger! I don't get why this book got so many good reviews. It's not a pleasant read. It has no flow. While reading this book I became annoyed by Moore's writing style. It feels as if she was purposely trying to make it bad, just to be different. The only good thing about this book is the dog stealing chicken scene."
3,A Rollercoaster of Emotions,"This book takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, mostly down steep slopes as she opens her life & relates the tragedy of growing up with two wicked witches for role models compounded by the fact that her body clung to every calorie she ever devoured.Here is a little girl who is starved for love & gorged on food.The mother made me VERY angry as she mercilessly abuses the author both physically & mentally.This witch had no business caring for a goldfish much less another human being. Lastly,many of the weighty obstacles she encountered can now be treated successfully with proper food combining, exercise & small habit changes(ie no eating ice cream in the middle of the night!).Knowledge about losing weight has come a long way since the 1940s. Not a happy book, but realistic & eye opening for the reader who wants a look into what childhood obesity can be like."
3,motive unclear,"I'm not quite sure what to say about this book. The writer doesn't mince words or make excuses, she lays out her life, her pain, and her fat. She doesn't cut a sympathetic figure, and she isn't trying to be one. I had difficulty finding a context for the novel. Why write it? Was it for self exploration? To explain something to people she knows? To chew the fat? I couldn't figure it out, and couldn't decide if reading it was enlightening or vouyerism."
1,Annoying,"This book was nothing but annoying. I wasn't able to finish it because of how annoyed I was. In the first three chapters, the author goes on and on about all the food she loves to eat. It got really old fast and made everything feel off topic. The story didn't seem to have a story line. It was all over the place. It wasn't about her living her life as a ""fat"" girl, it was about her putting other women down with their personal struggles. A very immature book."
1,Worst book I've ever read or well tried to read,It was sooo boring for me. I only got 50 pages in and decided I wasn't gonna waste anymore of my time. She just names off foods and rambles. There's no plot line or anything and it's impossible to stay focused in my opinion. Not worth the money.
3,Thank you Judith Moore,"What an utterly depressing book. Truly devoid of hope, even at the end (which I found rather abrupt and disjointed). The author's sense of self-loathing was painful to witness. But I do have to thank Judith Moore for finally answering the question at the forefront of every thin person's mind when they see a fat person: ""How could she let herself get this way?"" This book answers that question in spades."
4,"Good, Quick Read","This book was a very good, honest, heart-wrenching, and short read. You will be surprised at the brutal honestly of Moore's words and wonder how she found the courage to recount some of the most humiliating times in her childhood.Don't pass this book by!"
5,Like attending a psychoanalysis session on obesity,"Rarely have I read such a detailed and honest portrayal of one person's struggle with obesity. Pulling no punches, Moore lets it all hang out...her abusive parents, her pain and despair and sense of hopelessness and her obsession with food. At the heart of the book is her loathing of her body, the container she would NOT have chosen to house her spirit."
2,Well written but too depressing to be worthwhile,"I heard this book was good, so I waited many months until I could finally get it. I have to say, though, it was one of the most unredeemingly depressing books I've ever read. I'm not unsympathetic to the plight of ""fat girls"", as the author called herself. I have at times been significantly overweight myself, and I know how difficult it is. But this book was just filled with such self-loathing that it got painful for me to read. Despite the fact that I almost quit reading it twice, I finally finished it because I hoped that there would be something redeeming in it by the end. But unfortunately there wasn't. It was about the author's self-hatred up until the very end.It's not even that the subject matter was too depressing. Sickened by Julie Gregory was about a far more disturbing subject (child abuse), and it was still riveting reading. This book made me feel like I was reading someone's suicide note."
4,Matches text. Great read. Include page numbers.,"Pros:Included page numbers.Exactly matched the printed version.Text was formatted the same was as the printed version.A decent read on the ipad.Cons:There is an introduction before the novel itself. It used locations and not page numbers, making it hard to skip directly to Bacchae. It was odd that book transitioned from locations to page numbers.Navigation through the novel was poorly formatted with the table of contents. It works but I expected more for a pay book.Normal amazon kindle ipad app problems. I was really unable to customize my experience reading the book. ""More of a amazon development problem but some people might like to know."""
4,a graphic story of the consequences of not believing,"Euripides' ""the bacchae"" is an interesting story about a king who refuses to believe a stranger who walks into his city is a god. It's very graphic toward the end and the visual imagery is fantastic."
1,No Greek text,"This review refers to the paperback Bryn Mawr commentary of Euripides' Bacchae by Beth Causey copyright 1995 ISBN 0-929524-85-3.Usually, Bryn Mawr commentaries come with the Greek text. The information on Amazon says that the book is 28 pages. In fact the book I received was 21 pages and is only a commentary - it is missing the Greek text.The poor rating in this review does not refer to the quality of commentary by Beth Causey but the fact that I expect commentaries to have a copy of the Greek text, and I expect books I order to be the same number of pages as stated in the information on Amazon.Several of the reviews here seem to be of a different book altogether since they refer to an English translation of the text. I have never heard of a Bryn Mawr commentary that gave an English translation of the text."
1,disgraceful translation,"No translator is credited for this text - the incredible story of Dionysus' entry into Greece which has interesting hints of hidden rituals and about which Nietzsche wrote extensively. Dodds, the Greek scholar, has also concentrated on it. The text here, published by Classicbooksamerica, uses a mock-Biblical English (""doths"" and ""canst thous""), making it dreary for the contemporary reader. . .lacks clarity, lacks soul."
4,spirituals should be separate from secular,"I like the album, I just wish the secular songs were notincluded with the religious song. It should be a separatealbum. But I guess nothing can be done about it. I just lovethe spiritual part of the album."
2,Too many errors and too dense,"I get unceasing complaints about this text. The explanations are too shallow, the topics are too dense, and the author presents wonderful proofs with no explanation of what it is he is really trying to prove, or why the proof is important. To make matters worse, there are material errors in the text that impact the dicussion he presents. These errors make it nearly impossible to understand the underlying points he wants to make, and unfortunately there are many errors (for example, his whole discussion of CNF in Chapter 2. There are many others).I think that when the author corrects these errors, and rewrites uncomprenhensible parts, this could be a good text. For now it is average at best, and I do not think it is ready to be used for classes, at least not at an undergraduate level."
4,Nice introduction to computability and complexity,"This an introduction to complexity theory very different from Hopcroft and Ullman's book. It has material on lower-bound methods for circuit complexity, space-time tradeoffs (and VLSI area-time tradeoffs) and memory-hierarchy tradeoffs, which I didn't know at all before opening this book. It also has a very nice explanation of the efficient parallel prefix circuit."""
5,Quality Information,"I just received this book, and already I like it! It has a lot of information about rosacea, about treatment, and ways I can do something about it. Most of this is new information to me. Beginning with an exact description of my experience in being diagnosed (down to the two pamphlets and vagueness), I found a lot to think about and to be surprised and comforted by."
5,Dealing with Rosacea,"Run don""t walk to your nearest book dealer to buy this wonderful book! Although most Rosacea sufferers are familiar with some of the information in the book,there is also a wealth of information that the authors bring to light! The resources are excellent and very easy to read.For the first time the reader will feel like they are in control of this wretched disorder instead of it being in control of them!"
1,"Save your money, search the web","Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a lot known about rosacea yet. Not what causes it, how to cure it, and the same treatments will work differently on two people. My best advice, see a dermatologist if you think you have this, or find odd our face or neck red and sensitive. He or she will know best what to try first. Then search the web, there are informative sites there. See medlineplus and rosacea.orgYou are probably trying to find more about the condition and if anything is going to be right for you. This book, and the few others, are mostly a collection of the authors experiences or those of others they've come to know. The stories say what worked for someone, the next has a completely different experience. Just like rosacea its frustrating."
4,Good sauce pot heavy but lid doesnot fit tightly,"This sauce pot does the job and very good at that but the only complaint I have is the lid is very loose and the lid end goes in to the pot for something like 5mm only. Hence be careful when you move the pan, the lid might slide off and fall and hurt your toe. Hence 4 four stars otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.The bottom of the pan has honey comb pattern for even heat conduction and does a good job.It is a good sauce pot and worth the money."
5,Eye opener of a story,"I really feel for Phineas Gage after reading his story--and I am completely amazed at how he survived his accident. The book, is geared towards scientificly curious children for the most part, large illustrations and explanations of various things. How medicine has change since Gage's time, etc. The photos are great and the book is very engaging, though I wouldn't reccomend it for the squeamish as it does describe the poor man's accident in detail. I can only wish to myself though that they had done one of those facial reconstructions from the skull and life mask, so we could see what he might have looked like as a person."
2,So-so...,"I'm fascinated by Phineas' injury, survival and subsequent challenges with his injury. However the book digressed more than I think it should have. When the author was explaining that doctors back in that time didn't use aseptic techniques and didn't even know that micro-organisms existed, that should have been about the end of that statement. But instead, the author digressed paragraph after paragraph giving a primer on microbiology, which is nearly irrelevant to phineas' condition. Yes, he got an infection, but did we need to learn a little microbiology to grasp the concept?Similarly, the author digressed for quite a while explaining the basics of neuroscience and anatomy that stretched (in my opinion) beyond the scope of Phineas and his injury.Over all I thought it was a good read. However, it's a relatively small book printed in relatively large type, nearly double-spaced. Perhaps the digressions were more for filler since I felt they went beyond the expected subject matter."
4,Really good for brain science,It was a really well written book for scientist studying brains.This was good book for history about scientist back then
5,a great non-fiction book for everyone!,"I just finished reading this book with a 12-year old middle schooler. Both of us loved every page of this book and the incredible story of Phineas Gage.As a undergrad student majoring in psychology, I also found this book to be quite fascinating, as it goes into more depth over the life of this extraordinary man who survived such a freak accident.The book is perfect for young adults as it is a work of non-fiction of the highest quality. It seems like there aren't enough non-fiction books out there today that are geared towards young readers. It is a great introduction to major topics in biology including bacteria, organization of cells, as well as an in-depth discussion of the brain. Definitely a great book for psychology and biology students alike!"
5,Manhattans Live From South Africa,"Rarely do you find vocalist that sound good without the use of studio enhancement. Gerald Alston is among the great. If you've enjoyed him in the past, this is a must have CD for you."
3,Good info but hard to read,"I run a wireless service for Italophiles called Mobìlito and was hoping to garner some insight from what has worked overseas where the wireless content and commerce marketplace is more developed. After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the book used...a wise move in retrospect. The good news is that there is useful and interesting info. The bad news is that Prof. Lamont's writing style comes off as stream-of-conscious lecture-discussions. The book lacks an editor and it shows coming off as unfocused. The organization is choppy and sometimes redundant making it difficult to read. Also, there is a measure of hypeful/name-dropping which reflects the time this book was written: pre-tech crash. As such the book quickly shows it's age. The book makes the cut as a keeper but I wouldn't recommend buying it new."
5,with its nice smooth quailty you cant not like it,"""Time Has Come"" is a very enjoyable album, all the way through from crickets to heavy guitar solos. I give it 5 stars because even though its got some rough edges in the production of it, since it is self released, i think it makes it more wonderful and it sounds more from the heart. Each song is delightful and makes you smile whether the lyrics are airy and good natured about love like ""Golden"" or deep and about death like ""24 Hours"". With the great lyrics and melodies this album is so likeable, the feeling in the songs are easy to relate to and in a way it touches home. I love the theme of this album, too. Its nice to see something like this done to an album that is so original."
3,"Light read, but not all true","I was born in Boston, so this was amusing to read; however, a lot of the items he presents as ""fact"" are incorrect. The book is actually riddled with errors, so I would not suggest anyone use this as a reference tool."
2,disappointing,"The Mihoshi special was the better of the two. But not by too much. Basically it was a mediocre plot only made interesting by occasional 'in-jokes' and using the other characters to 'act out' the story. All of whom resented being made part of the story. But the Pretty Sammy episodes were obviously just used as a testing ground of ideas, some of which carried over to the later much better Pretty Sammy series. However most of them were dropped like a hot potato. Deservedly so. The 3 Sammy stories were just not well thought out, being choppy and jumpy in their storylines. Example, Pixy Misa forgot she was supposed to be French in half of her lines. They should either have added about 10-15 minitues to each episode to make it smoother, or as they did do, give up and start over with the much improved Pretty Sammy series."
4,good,if you like Tenchi like i do you'll have to pick this up it was cool but Pretty Sammy was is like a goofy spoof of Sailor Moon but i think its suppose to be like that...well we'll say it is anyhow alright? Good.
4,a collection of rare pistol/ex pistols tunes,"this is a great find for die hard fan with the only studio recorded version of no fun that i know of considering the sex pistols had enough matterial for a second album before self destructing most you can only get live and many were played many show but the rest were very limited a few were recorded a put mindlessly on albums just for $ale$ (schools are prisons,satilite,substitute,belsen was a gas,I did you no wrong,no lip,stepping stone,understanding,flowers,whatcha gonna do?threw my eyes,and with no fun on this cd)plenty back in the day for an album. and the ex pistols side of this cd is pretty good some great rare matterial with here we go again& revolution in the class room but some of the other song are lacking the true musical talent(can i say that with the sex piatol?yea I can!)that they once showed."
3,Oldie but...wow i remeber this designe from 1982!,"Hello, This is a Kenwood Eq for your car. Compact and versatile and exactly Kenwood quality. It's alot of money but if you need a controller for two more amps this might be just your solution. I feel for a hundred, the package should have included an visual graghic twin . I remember passing over this way back in 1982 for a Realistic because the Realistic was less expensive 39.00 and include a visual eq."
2,Ho-Hum,"Why American critics are so desperate to make Tennessee Williams into the ""great"" American playwright is beyond me -- perhaps they feel inadequate when compared to the genius that's come out of England and Continental Europe (e.g., Shaw, Shakespeare, Moliere).The characters are seldom well-developed, and frequently, I found myself not caring what happened to them. Or rather, I hoped that Mr. Williams would kill them all off a little quicker so he could end the wretched work."
1,Non Enjoyable,Non Enjoyable because amonzon needs to know how to treat the costumers. especially when something isn't there fault.
5,Dunstable's Musical Sublime,"The ""sweet harmony"" here refers to the then-revolutionary use of thirds and sixths, which were previously considered dissonant. Strange to think that they are now anathema for any serious modern composer! There is also a noticeable increase in the freedom of individual voices, in some pieces different voices singing different texts, allowing for a new harmonic and rhythmic complexity which leads to moments of the ""musical sublime""; In other words, an overwhelming sound that gives the listener a feeling of a great expanse or an immense presence (cf. Mahler's 8th). The recording was made in Chancelade Abbey and is pleasantly reverberant, but not at the expense of clarity.This disc is yet another entry in Tonus Peregrinus's excellent discography, further cementing their status as the premiere Medieval and Renaissance group recording today."
4,Not bad at all!!!,"The first time I heard this song was at a nightclub. The melody of The Price Is Right TV show caught my attention, yet was very suprised it was done by Crystal Waters...The crowd seemed to like it...I would recommend this CD single for DJ mixing."
3,Good content,"This is a textbook for Spanish at a college level. No information on the writers themselves. Very thick, so the paperback format dooms it to fall apart, like mine did. Definitely need a dictionnary to read & understand. Contains Don Juan Tenorio."
4,Must-have book for any serious memorabilia collector,All of Carl Hungness' Indianapolis 500 or Brickyard 400 yearbooks should be considered as must-have books for any serious memorabilia collector. These books are invaluable to my collection. The photgraphs are superb in all of the books.
2,You know how you feel 30 minutes after you eat a donut?,"That's how this video makes me feel. Doug Stanhope is funny here, I laughed a few times, but I can't sit through the hole thing without feeling the way Doug looks...and he just looks sick the whole way through with those freaky drugged out rat eyes. Gotta admit, there's no way I could drink that much and be that coherent. Must be a gift. The biggest irony is that he's just as big of a hypocrite as the judgmental masses he bashes. And so am I. I don't know, not much different from sitting next to a drunk guy on a bar stool who wont shut up about his opinions, and has a funny way of expressing them. An interesting, down your throat point of view."
2,no refunds vs. deabeat hero,"I think ""deadbeat hero"" is a much better DVD. The set-up for ""no refunds"" just seemed off. The mirror background behind the stage was distracting and the stage seemed too bright. Stand-up comedy works best with some darkness. That's why I think the black and white works so well in ""deadbeat hero."" Stanhope's material didn't really have any continuity to it and it's not his strongest stuff in the way of punchlines."
1,shock factor,"Rather that developed some respectable material this guy banks on your love of shock. He is a repulsive, suffering fool who demonstrates little talent but expects to trick you into thinking his views are acceptable. I find his views nothing but the resentment of a wasted life that are not funny unless you suffer a similar and miserable existance. I wish I could get a refund."
5,"Great, different standup","This was a great standup video. I am adding Doug Stanhope to my short list of comics I really like. His style is different, but intelligent and full of anger but constantly laugh out loud funny. For reference: I also like Daniel Tosh, some Carlin, some Katt Williams."
5,The best of the best,"Doug Stanhope is easily the best working comic doing what he does. Thought provoking, smart, and at times flinch inducing. Truly not for the timid or people who are easily offended his comedy will leave you mentaly exhausted and your stomach aching from guilty laughter.Buy his cds and seek out the live shows. Cause the live shows are where its at."
3,"Interesting, But Not Worth Reading Twice","This book, covering the 1950's case of Anjette Lyles who was convicted of the murder of four people including her own 9 yr. old daughter, was a good read but far from what I would call a ""must"" read true crime book. Although it was fascinating to read about Georgia society and courtroom procedures during the late '50's (I can't believe the prosecutor would read the jury's verdict to the accused at the end of the trial- but it was true!)this book relied heavily on court transcripts it appears since many of the principles are now not alive. It lacks the ""shock"" value you read in many good true crime books of current days but does do a nice job of setting the ""facts"" down for the reader and convincing you that the jury reached a just verdict. A good book but not one you would read more than once."
2,Not that Great,"The Prayer of Jesus is Ken Hemphill's short work on the Lord's Prayer and how it can be used as a model for prayer. He breaks it down into fifteen different parts, grouped in threes. If that sounds confusing, it is. Some of the categories are responsiblities, requests, and reasons.Hemphill has a few good insights into prayer. He doesn't agree with vain repetition of the Lord's Prayer, but also doesn't advocate ignoring it. He is able to blend stories of his own families relationships and communication with spiritual life and conversation with God, but sometimes the anecdotes are forced.The writing is choppy, and I found it hard to stay interested. I didn't like the dissection of the Lord's Prayer. I think there is a lot to be learned from it, but it shouldn't be broken down into little pieces like an essay. This is a nice effort, but I don't find that it helps one's prayer life."
5,THE BEST,"Yes ADA, i love'it very much too. It's a rock opera like Sirens-Savatage. I really recomand to all people who likes the mean of good music. Re all K. Diamond fans."
4,"This is a concert,","This minimalist prodution does have its virtues, but it is not evoking any emotional response from me. The orchestra is gorgeous and exciting thanks to Thielemann. But the main problem is that Watson is not an Elektra. She can sing it, but she is uninvolved and just start to do so a little at the end. It is like a rehearsal, a concert. Give me Rysanek, Varnay, or Behrens for the real thing."
2,Dr. Seuss How Could You,"His books are brilliant, but once the good doctor strays into pedagogy he tends to mess up. While not as bad as collecting phrases into a book and selling them post-humously, this particular attempt to educate the kiddies pales in comparison to his other works."
1,Re-record's with one or more of the original group plus live covers,"Poor, poor quality. No original tunes here. All are weak and thin sounding copies. The 'Live' covers songs are horrid. Some off brand(?) manufactured in the Czech Republic and sold by Selected Sound Carrier of Switzerland which does not translate to a quality product in this case!Save your money as all are way over priced..."
2,Very mediocre,"Written by foreigners who apparently spent too little time in the Southwest, the text is thin and the photography so-so in comparison to the other fine guidebooks out there. It comes across as lacking much intimate knowledge of such a magnificent region. The book would only be satisfactory to a reader who never saw any other book about the Southwest."
4,One of the best in the series,"This last installment in Naxos's Barber series collects together some of Barber's lesser known and hard-to-find pieces. The Fadograph of a Yestern Scene and the Canzonetta are achingly beautiful and not often recorded. My major complaint with this release is the placement of A Hand Of Bridge. Being a somewhat erratic vocal piece, it does not belong in the middle of the CD where it breaks the meditative flow of the other five instrumental pieces. It either belongs as the last selection on the CD, or better still, paired with Knoxville, Summer of 1915, another Barber vocal composition.That other CD, was also poorly programmed by Naxos by their inclusion of two of Barber's three orchestral Essays. These lovely pieces shouldn't have been tainted by their proximity to the vocal piece. That is, an all-vocal Barber CD would have been welcomed by all.At 52:28, the skimpiest offering in Naxos's survey of Barber's work."
4,catchy and enjoyable,"Rankin Roger's first album has always been in my favorite top 30 albums of all time. After I heard of this release, I was a little concerned about how much I would enjoy it. Now that I have been listening to it for over a month, I'm beginning to grow very fond of his new tunes and music styles. Roger has a unique talent for blending emotional, intelligent and catchy songs with infectious grooves, danceable beats, and ska reggae melodies. Another great album that is holding strong in my CD player in my car. If you like General Public, buy this album!"
3,Ranking Roger Moves On,This album is a big step forward for RR. His first solo album not very good. This one shows maturing lyrics and funky beats. My only problem is that it could have used some real drums/sax/guitar over the top of the mix.Maybe we will see the English Beat regroup?!?!?
3,adorable,"The pictures in this memory book are adorable. I'll admit, I still haven't finished filling it out, but it was the best one I've found."
5,LOVE IT,This silverware is great. The pieces are very neat and not bulky. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,The Gladdest Thing,"You may be coming to this CD after hearing Deb Talan's unfathomably undiscovered voice singing the song ""Forgiven"" in the movie, ""Lovely and Amazing"". I did. And I've been listening to this CD over and over and over ever since. Wait til you hear the song,""The Gladdest Thing"" or seriously any song offered up here. You know how most CD's have at least a few songs that you skip everytime you listen? Not here. And, if you have a soul you will cry during at least one.It kind of bugs me when the reviews I read tell you how this is their favorite album blah blah blah but they don't tell you what they are comparing it to. For all you know they could have a drawer full of Tom Petty, Springsteen and Dave Matthews. So let me just say that I listen to Paul Westerberg, Jonatha Brooke, Ani, any old Dylan...you get the picture. So buy this CD. Believe me, you'll want to manage her."
4,"Good, mellow CD","Deb Talan is very talented - this CD is mellow, and good to listen to over and over. I also very much like her work with her husband in their band The Weepies - enjoy!"
4,Unfortunately Misses 5 Star,"Indeed yes...Carol Douglas is the disco queen of the 70-80s, rivaling Gloria Gayner and even Donna Summer. But this album almost misses 5 star because the tunes in most cases are just short single versions of around 3-4 minutes (the CD's total length is only 42 min.!), even though it broadly encompasses her representative fancy hits. It's regrettable. One of the biggest factor characterizing disco music is its length, so please include the extended 12' inch versions as much as possible !"
4,Perhaps the 3rd leading lady of Disco,"By some music historians Carol Douglas is credited with having the first Disco Hit with Doctor's Orders. This collection contains this smash as well as her other mega hit Midnight Love Affair.A number of cover tunes (reworked to a disco beat) are included here as well including; ABBA's Dancing Queen, The Bee Gees's Night Fever, and perhaps the most unique, The Door's, Light My Fire.Carol has a good voice, and these songs are fun, and it once again shows that real talent emerged from image of Disco."
3,Excellent story!,"I enjoyed this movie very much! I'm not a big fan of Roselyn's, but all the other actors did extremely great. And the beautiful sights of the island of Culebra made me want to go visit one day. It's a true story and very well worth watching!"
1,Get your money back!,This DVD was so boring and the storyline took me nowhere. I sold this DVD to Buy Backs! What a waste of money!
4,Pretty good scope mount rings,"I purchased these scope rings for a really nice Tasco scope that I found at a garage sale. It fit the scope very well, had good rise to keep the scope above the iron sights, and firmly affixed to the dovetail rail. The only issue I noticed at all is the inability to completely tighten the screws down without a small gap being left because of the diameter of the scope itself. It seems that the inserts in the rings were not made quite precisely enough for a true fit. It still does the job nicely and I do recommend the product, especially for the price."
3,"Good, but buyer beware","I saw the Stones on this tour in Nov. 1969, and was particularly anxious to see the DVD. The DVD has only 5 songs on it - not an entire live concert as I had expected. It's a short video and has a lot of filler from backstage. While it is interesting to see a clip of Hendrix backstage with the Stones, IMHO, the video is not worth the extra money over just buying the downloaded edition.My second gripe is with marketing it as a 3 CD set. CD #1 is the original album release with 10 tracks. CD #2 has 5 bonus tracks. Why not just add the bonus tracks to the first CD? I believe there is room - but this is typical Stones marketing to make you think you're getting more than you are.The best bonus material is on CD #3, which contains two sets by BB King and Tina Turner. The BB King material was some of the best live cuts I've heard. I'm not such a fan of Turner, but it was fun to hear her in her prime."
2,too pricey for my blood,"ABKCO stands for Alan B. Klein CO. 'Nuff said. This was his last effort to gouge the public before his big journey south. All the way down. No doubt Ron Decline and his tag team partner, Col. Parker are presently ripping off the Devil. (That's why the Stones have Sympathy For The Devil.) Borrow a copy of this thing, burn on a 10 cent blank disc the third CD (the new disc 1) with I&T T and BB, then combine discs 1 and 2 in the proper song order, (the new disc 2) and enjoy. I hope Taylor gets some cash from this mess, anyway."
2,Below par by far,"Several other reviewers have already given accuate reviews of the numerous shortcomings of this pathetic effort to squeeze your dollars from your wallet. The only worthwhile disc and reason for 2 stars, instead of the well deserved single, were the blues covers from BB King and Tina/Ike. Save your money!"
5,Stones at their ya-ya best,This clearly is the definitive live Stones recording. Mick Taylor asserts himself as the group's eminent lead guitar player (sorry Ronnie). His leads on Sympathy for the Devil are simply wicked as well on his classic licks on Midnight Rambler. Any Stones fan must have this selection.
1,"Blame Abkco, not Stones, and wait for ""Ladies & Gentlemen...""","The original album always had muddy sound and this is just an averageperformance. No amount of remastering can change that. A far betterperformance, and I think their best ever, is the film ""Ladies and Gentlemen...the Rolling Stones."" The Houston, TX show from the '72/'73 tour.Originally presented in quadraphonic sound, this film was shownin L.A. and New York and soon vanished. You can find the bootleg dvdof this on E-bay. Even though it has not been remastered, it looks andsounds great. The band is tighter and faster. Richards and Taylor aremore in sync. The Stones don't control Abkco so don't blame them.Wait for the official release of L & G or get the bootleg. I promise youway more satisfaction."
2,"Save your money, it's just not worth it...","Yep, I have to agree with several others who reviewed this; it is one of the greatest live releases of all-time, but this edition is a pure cash-grab. There is absolutely no reason why the 5 additional tracks (timing out at all of 18 minutes) could not have been added to the original disk. The BB King/Ike & Tina shows are very good, but not spectacular, and the DVD is utterly self-indulgent and pointless to the extent of being virtually unwatchable, even for a die-hard Stones fan. The packaging is nice, but this should have been a 2-disk set for less then $20..."
1,Save your money,If you don't own a copy of this already then maybe. But otherwise this is a total ripoff for the price. The DVD is 5 minutes of Charlie standing in the rain.
5,Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones In Concert (40th Anniversary Deluxe Box Set) 3 cds + 1 DVD,Excellent sound quality! Stunning DVD! If there was a 10 star catagorey this item would qualify!
3,Docked two stars for no tour book as originally advertised.,"The LP's and bonus content make it a worthwhile purchase. Like others that pre-ordered this set though, I'm very disappointed that the tour book was not included. Love the B.B. King and Ike/Tina Turner sets. It's rare to get such a complete concert."
5,DESERT ISLAND DISC #2 (Out of 12) - 'Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!',"... 'Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out' - by THE ROLLING STONES - is my Desert Island Disc #2 (Out of 12). This album is a MASTERPIECE! ... If I were to be stranded on a Desert Island, and could only bring 12 albums with me, it would be these twelve gems! ... 'Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!' is the ULTIMATE Rolling Stones album, NOT because it has their greatest songs on it, but because The Stones are heard best LIVE - and on this album, they rocked the world! - The Aeolian Kid."
3,Only 3 Stars Because:,"I want these people that make these DVD packages to stop messing with the layouts by putting them on several discs, PUT THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL LIVE CONCERT AND CD ON ONE OR TWO DISCS AND RELEASE THEM AT A LOWER PRICE, I BOUGHT THE STONES 4 DISC BOXED SET LIVE CONCERT A FEW YEARS AGO 'USED' AND IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION AND ONLY PAID $[...] BUCKS FOR ALL 4 DISCS. THE SAME GOES FOR THE BIG BANG BOXED SET AND I ONLY PAID $[...] BUCKS USED FOR THAT ONE. IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE DISCS ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT'S WORTH IT, BUT I ALSO HATE ALL THOSE BLASTED PRESEQUENCING MENU ITEMS BECAUSE OF THE LAYERS OF THE DISCS, SOMETIMES I JUST WANT TO SEE THE CONCERT STRAIT UP WITH NO INTERUPTIONS."
1,THIS MAKES NO SENSE....,"I would not mind getting the Tina Turner, BB King stuff and the bonus tracks. This is the way Mick originally wanted it released, but the record co. rejected the idea. However, why stick the DVD in there with only 4 tracks? - the BONUS tracks no less! Are we to believe the whole show does not exist on video? Why not just release the audio and release the complete DVD separetely? It would be interesting to see the video of the audio we have known and loved all these years, but noooo...they give us the 4 tracks only. This makes no sense..."
2,All wrong...,"This package could have been so good...and they just got it ALL wrong! First, why not add the 4 extra tracks to the original track listing and add more unreleased music from the vault...Second...as great as Ike and Tina and the others are...this is not about them. This is absolutely one of the best live recordings ever...and it could have been made even better...but I think the really botched this one...BUT...I would like those extra 4 tracks so I guess I'll moan and pay the high price for these tracks and the little bit of extra video..."
2,WTF ?,"I'm still wrestling with the concept of adding 20 minutes of ""bonus material"" from the same concert(s) to a 47 minute album (disc #1), and putting it on a separate disc (disc #2), rather than combining them on to a single comprehensive disc (with room to spare).Still drawing blanks.OK - on to disc #3. We get the support acts from the shows. Good stuff here, but ... why ? Coulda been worse - what if they applied this treatment to other live Stones albums like ""Still Life"" ? Would we get the complete Henry Paul Band set ?On to bonus DVD (disc #4). We get the concert video. Of just the 20 minutes of ""bonus live tracks"" (see disc #2).WTF ?I love the Stones and always dug ""Get Yer Ya Ya's Out"", but this is a mess."
4,Great Product,Works great for vocab and spelling words. It has most of the words but not all word forms. Helps when writing essays and papers because of the Thesaurus so it doesn;t get repetitive. Overall worth the money.
3,It's only half a dictionary without pronunciation,"This is the closest thing I found to have both an organizer and a dictionary. Only if it had pronunciation! It's hard to believe there is nothing better out there, but that is the case as far as a pocket size conbination of organizer and dictionary is concerned. I was looking at both Palm and Pocket PC platforms but disappointed. While the Palm has a barely functional dictionary (for just a bit more), Pocket PC has nothing so far. How come? I'm willing to pay."

1,COmparative costs,This seiko Dictionary-ETC is available in New Zealand for $NZ59.95 - $US29.95. Something is amiss ? Mauro Zanderigo Auckland New Zealand
3,Disappointed,"For the price, I expected stay cool handles...not even close. Also the name ScanpanUSA is a bit misleading, its made in China. The pasta insert is less than what I expected as well. The pasta insert that comes with the Circulon Pasta set is sturdier."
5,Includes the following songs:,"1) Johnny Mathis - Love Theme from Romeo & Juliet; 2) Jerry Vale - Have You Looked Into Your Heart; 3) Doris Day - More; 4) Jim Nabors - The First Time Ever (I Saw Your Face); 5) Peter Nero - Theme from ""Summer of '42""; 6) Andy Williams - Love Story (Where Do I Begin); 7) Burl Ives - I'll Be Your Baby Tonight; 8) Patti Page - Gentle On My Mind; 9) Bobby Vinton - Sealed With A Kiss; 10) Robert Goulet - My Love, Forgive Me"
1,No good,It did not help at all. The child does not allow holding this tool near his mouth and ears.The construction of the tool is also not well suited to the face. The mouth piece should have been curved so as to be square to the mouth and not parallel to it.
5,Gal's Summer Beach Movie,"Pour a tall cool one, put up your feet and watch this delightful, moving saga set by the shoreline---Luanne Rice at her best authoring!"
4,Good series,"The series wasn't quite what I expected, as it differed from the book quite a bit, but all in all, it was pretty good!"
2,Nothing like the book.,"I ordered this movie because I loved the book. So when saw they made a movie out of the book, I wanted to see it. This movie was nothing like the book. They took some parts of the book but totally changed it around. In the book, Nell is nine, in this movie, Nell is 16. Very disappointed."
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I have always enjoyed watching Julia Ormond (maybe because my grandmother's parents were Ormonds, born in Sterling Castle), so when looking for films she was in I came across Beach Girls. The other reviews all made it sound so wonderful, so I purchased it. Much to my disappointment, the movie is more about the teenagers than Rob Lowe's and Julia Ormond's characters--indeed, I would consider their story line to be secondary to that of Chelsea Hobbs' character. But I will admit that when they are on screen I enjoyed their performances and story, and the photography is very good.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful. Thanks."
3,a promising start,"i like my stories with a bit more, uh, plot, but i still find myself drawn to this book. the author plays with notions of god and faith quite adeptly.if you like your novels surreal and disjointed, i cannot think of a better book to recommend. if you prefer a little more narrative, check out some of the author's more recent books."
2,Daegu girl,"The line I agree with most in this book has to be on the back cover: ""No book summary can do it justice."" It's not your conventional sort of a book, take that as either praise or damnation depending on your tastes! Honestly, it didn't suit my tastes, I'm a fan of narrative and know very little about the surreal. But if you do, then am sure you'll like it, because the author doesn't hold back. The best thing about this book is that it's shameless and bold enough to say whatever it wants! Which you have to appreciate for honesty alone. Personally, I hope the next book is more accessible. It's like Marmite - a love or hate thing, so you have to read it for yourself!"
1,Beating a dead horse,Given that the IAEA declared Iraq nuclear-free in 1998 and thus far nobody has found any evidence that Saddam restarted the program after the inspectors left the country this book is more than ridiculous.The sensationalist and flatly biased authors ignore the fact that Saddam's nuclear program evolved and almost reached its peak during the Reagan and Bush years but was completely dismantled during Clinton's tenure. Even if Saddam had wanted to nuke the US --which itself is a rather silly allegation-- he never had the means to do it.If these so-called journalists think they know it better they should present their arguments to the IAEA or to the coalition forces who are now inspecting Iraq. I wonder what they could achieve.This book is a good read for those who are either paranoid or pathologically anti-Clinton or both but not for those who really want to know what happened to Iraq's nuclear capability during the 90s.
2,A boring film in October,"I admit I was swayed to purchase this DVD by the good reviews it received on Amazon. I like films about WWII; I like DB Sweeny; and the plight of Danish Jews sounded compelling. But the film is a 'dud' and sad to say in particular because DB Sweeny just isn't very good here.The story of the Danish Jews escaping to Sweden just before they were to be sent to concentration camps by the Nazi's, should hold anyone's interest, but the effort by the filmaker to make an engaging movie just falls flat. Scenes go on too long with no forward movment of the story and I just couldn't find anything that likeable about the characters. So don't be fooled by the reviews; this movie isn't terrible--just 'dull' in its presentation and really not worth your time."
2,Lame acting,"Acting was lame at best. Sounded like they were reading their scripts. Very hokey. Not a good representation of the incredible true events surrounding the organized escape of over 7,000 jews from Denmark, and the way it was carried out by the Danish people. If you want to see a good movie about these events, see Miracle at Midnight. Much much better, even though it's a Disney ""made for tv"" movie."
5,EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BY SWEENEY,"PLAYS A DANISH JEW IN WWII. IS SHOT BY THE NAZIS AND NURSED BY TO HEALTH BY A GIRL WHO FOUND HIM.WHEN HE HEARS THAT THE NAZIS ARE GOING TO TAKE THE JEWS TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS, HE MAKES ARRANGMENTS TO GET THEM TO NEUTRAL SWEDEN"
1,A REAL WASTE OF MONEY AT ANY COST,"I purchase a lot of music from Amazon and this is the worst I have ever heard. Actually giving it one star is being generous. These singers could not possibly be ""The Drifters"". These guys could not hold a note if someone gave it to them in a bucket.SHAME on Amazon for offering this low budget remake of these classic songs. Scratchy 45's sound better."
2,Author Doesn't Know Much About Subject,"I could tell right away that the author, a general nutritionist, knew little about IBD before being commissioned to write this book. There's a little text (rather stiffly written) at the beginning that sounds like the boilerplate stuff you'd find in any introductory book on IBD. Most of the book, though, is made up of recipes, which don't sound much different from recipes you'd find in any cookbook. All in all, not a good match between writer and subject."
3,Some good ideas and recipes - a little technical,"Unlike Dr. Scala's book, this book actually does address the topic of inflammatory bowel disease as it pertains to nutrition and Greenwood does a good, if technical job, of outlining the major issues of nutrition in the role of IBD. She outlines numerous diets for different IBD situations and has many recipes available (pretty much the bulk of the book). My criticism centers around two points: 1) for me as a vegetarian, many of the diets were inaccessible due to their reliance on meat (a common occurrence in IBD books since meat is very low-residue) and 2) the recipes are very hard to read since she has detailed metric and standard measurements (which are laid out oddly) and each recipe is followed by a very technical breakdown of its elements - even to the kilojoule of energy! If you are a carnivore, I think this could be a very useful book to have - or at least to read."
1,Does NOT work for me.,"The recipes have milk and cheese -- IBD makes many people lactose intolerant. Also, recipes include nuts and mayo and beans, etc. Virtually no recipes I can have. This book may work for someone, but it was a big disappointment for me.The Heather Van Vorous book, Eating for IBS, is great."
5,"Excellent survey by a historian who ""gets it""","This is the book later republished under the title _Big Fleet Actions_. It is an excellent overview of the naval battles of Tsushima, Jutland and the Philippine Sea. While the Jutland section may have been overtaken by new analyses published later, the Philippine Sea section is a major account of this battle which is somewhat neglected in comparison with Leyte Gulf, 4 months later. Particularly illuminating is Grove's use of the battle to effectively demolish criticisms of aircraft carriers as ""having half their aircraft devoted to self defense"" by pointing out that the success of the US fighters in destroying the rebuilt Japanese carrier air force was a decisive victory in and of itself. Much better than Keegan's foray into naval history."
3,"Four stars for Op. 111, two stars for Op. 115",Performance of Op.115 is vulgar and clarinet is tasteless. Op. 111 is better. Too bad I could not listen to this CD before buying it.
1,20 page Monograph,The item I received is not an pictured. It is also a 20 page monograph. I thought this was a book. It also has no symbols in it. It is filled with Rosicrucian ways on living. It does not focus on symbols or explain symbols which is what the title states it should do. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this book. There is nothing in it that you could not get elsewhere or from AMORC itself.
4,Rub a Dub Dub,"First of all when you get the DVD version, you have the opportunity to watch the film as it was originally filmed - in English. Anyone who speaks French and can read lips knows that the film was dubbed into French (and not just bad sync-sound) - the film was later released back in the states with English subtitles under the French dub (talk about a triple threat).I must say that I love this movie for tackling issues that 20 years ago were definitely still taboo in the mainstream. Although not a masterpiece in terms of plot development, I believe it stays true to the development of Jean Genet's characters - and of course the cinematography is stunning. Like watching a live action Tom of Finland cartoon directed by David Lynch at times... Wonderful."
5,Jean Genet lives on film.,"The imperfections of this film--slow pacing (by American standards), choppy transitions, complex and convoluted plot, unpredictable outcomes hidden from the viewer until the last moment then released with insufficient force--are truly irrelevent when the experience of the essence of Genet's novel and its leading character are so effectively brought to the screen in its form, color, casting and concept. Brad Davis is awesome in his portrayal of Querelle--enormous emotional and physical risk, awkward to watch at times because of its truth and openness. If you love Genet, as I do, there is no finer interpreter of his sensibilities than Fassbinder. I am not an expert on Fassbinder, but I love this film."
1,Ghastly bit of tripe,"Absolutely dreadful film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Arty and pretentious in every aspect--cardboard scenery, garish lighting, intrusive vocal score (sounding like medieval chant), stilted dialogue, bombastic narration, and worst of all, wooden performances by Brad Davis, Franco Nero and French film legend, Jeanne Moreau. It feels like a very bad experimental off-off-Broadway play.The plot is totally incomprehensible. Perhaps it would have made more sense if I hadn't fallen asleep several times during the movie. Usually if I doze off I back a film up to see what I missed, but not with this one. I just kept hoping it would end.I felt embarrassed for everyone involved in this ghastly mess, especially Moreau: ""Querelle"" certainly isn't one of the highlights of her distinguished career.Avoid this thing like the plague, unless you're an out-and-out masochist."
2,Very slow and very strange,This movie is based on a homoerotic novel and so might not be suitable for general audiences. But even the most open-minded viewer will find this movie very slow and very difficult to watch. The homosexual iconography and imagery is over the top and a bit off-putting. The film was shot on a sparse set and the violence in the movie has such stylised choreography that the combined effect is very artificial. This film is a bit self-indulgent on Fassbinder's part. If you are interested in exploring the work of Fassbinder start anywhere else but here.
3,"If survives only just... as camp homo erotic ""adventure""","It has a wonderful theatrical setting and Jeanne Mereou and Brad Davis and an expressional look.... Under these circumstanses - and the homo erotic theme - it survives, if only just...."
1,What a Nightmare!,"I have heard about this movie for decades so decided since I enjoyed Brad Davis, I would give it a try. Boy, was I surprised! Watching this movie is similar to viewing an accident...you keep watching to see what will happen next. Trust me, nothing better happens. It was truly a waste of time and money in purchasing this film."
2,Is it camp or is it serious....,"This was Fassbinder's final film, and I didn't like very much about it. I saw in a pan and scan VHS copy, and thought it was one of the silliest, most pretentious things I've ever seen. Seeing it in a widescreen DVD has altered my opinion only slightly. I do love the photography and the hilarious set design, which is overly phallic and rivals Ken Russell's films. It's hard to tell whether Fassbinder meant this as camp or as a serious film. The performances are really over the top, especially Hanno Poschl and Franco Nero's performances. There's a hilarious scene in which Poschl and Querelle (Brad Davis) are fighting, and they are interrupted by Jesus carrying the cross. The film is very homoerotic, more so than any other Fassbinder film, but it doesn't make it any better or more interesting. It's a shame this was his final film, but it doesn't diminish his legacy at all..."
1,"sorry, this is not a good farewell for Fassbinder","It's very sad that this film became his last. I too love Fassbinder's work and Brad Davis is great, but you can't say that by watching this piece. Please see this after you went through all other movies from this master otherwise you would get wrong impression about his talent."
5,"classic, sparse, and beautiful","This is a gorgeous record and possibly the most neglected gem in the Gene Clark canon. Simple, rustic arrangements call to mind The Band's ""brown album"" or Neil Young's ""Harvest"": acoustic guitar, harmonica, bass, drums, a little melancholy piano and stirrings of hammond organ and slide guitar. This album's mood also reminds me of Bob Dylan's ""Desire"". Gene Clark's poetic lyricism is genuinely moving, and his bittersweet, autumnal emotion shines through beautifully. I would also recommned this album to fans of modern bands like Red House Painters, Mojave 3, or Mazzy Star. GREAT"
4,Better Than Expected,"I have always been a major Byrds fan and yet I had never really explored Gene Clark as a solo artist. Fortunately this was my first Gene Clark solo record purchase. Over half the songs are really great. I really don't think that he is like anyone else. Yes, you can hear the Dylan influence slightly but he has a unique voice and the knack for weird chord combinations that lend a mood to the music. I personally loved Gene's earliest stuff before he felt he had to be a ""poet"". Even on White Light it seems that he tries a little too hard at times and he misses the mark that could have been hit with simplicity. It is definitely worth the money to buy this CD."
5,Gene at his best,"Gene Clark was one of the greatest singer/songwriters of the 20th century. This is one of his best albums. Gene's greatest ability was to express, in the length of of a song, an intense percerption of the immediate situation. Neither Dylan or Morrison could do this. For the closest literary comparisons check out Henry James or Marcel Proust. I refer you to songs such as ""Because of You,"" or ""Where My Love Lies Asleep"". He was one of a kind."
5,Very good for the money,"Pretty good picture quality for 20 bucks! I expected a lot of chromatic aberrations, ghosting, focusing problems, and collimation issues. None of these really seem to be showing themselves.Pros:Pretty decent and bright picture (even in twilight, these have 5mm exit pupil, which is probably optimal)The priceComes with a small compass (yeah, not marching grade, but will do in an emergency)Left and right eye can be focused differently (my right eye is +0.2)Multicoated lensesCons:Cheap look and feelCould be a bit sturdierEye cups could be softerWould be nice if protective pieces were attached permanentlyStrap could be nicer (hey, that one IS replaceable)While these are not Carl Zeiss, they are not 800 dollars, either. Please consider the cost."
4,Good quality,"Hi, I think that the quality is so good, I use it a little time. The hole is don't perfect because the base is not plane, it is like a dome."
4,Works great for the price!,"I was concerned about buying a ""cheap"" tool, but no need to worry! this little router worked perfectly for drilling holes into our many cabinet doors to outfit them with new hinges and modernize our kitchen.We did not need the really expensive one like the guy at the cabinet shop told us. My husband is a framing carpenter by trade. This worked PERFECTLY! and is a great bargain!"
5,Perfect tool,"I made my own kitchen cabinet doors and wanted to use a Blum hinge. This cutting bit worked perfectly and was very easy to use. After boring 60+ holes, it works just like it did the first time. Great product."
2,Horrible game...,"All the stages look the same, I guess the people who made this didn't take their time on it. You will get bored easily looking at the same scenes. The makers could've been at least creative with it, at least add some jungle scenes, volcanoes, mud, anything to make it interesting! I got tired of seeing indistinguishable stages. Plus the sound sucks."
1,LIES+LIES=BAD GAME,"When I first got this game it got good reviews, so I was excited. Then the disapointments came rolling in:-Bad sound. Well I could I live with that.-Bad controls. Can't live with that. I mean they're manageable, but overall bad.-Now we get to the lies. It said there was 5 interconnected enviorments that you could roam around in traversing from one to the other. That was the main reason I bought the game, and the closest thing to it was free run. Max 4 laps, and you couldn't go from one enviorment to the other like it said you could.-Bad crashes. Now after some major disapointments I could always look forward to bumping cars and causing traffic jams for a few brief minutes of fun. WRONG! All it does is bump, and nothing else.-Graphics. Can't complain they were decent, but you have to have good gameplay to.These are only a few of my complaints and is worth 5$ not 40$. I would avoid this game at all costs."
4,Gift game,"I don't have anything neagative to say about the game because it was a gift for my nephew during Christmas. As far as know, he enjoys playing it."
4,"Humane, poignant - and a darn good read!","I picked up this book because someone recommended it. I browsed through it soon after it arrived. Afew hours later, I found I'd browsed all the way to the end. It's a fast, compelling read.The book draws you into the life of Sita, a poor woman with big dreams. It reminded me of an Indian, fictionalized version of ""Angela's Ashes"" in its poignancy and authenticity.Married as a child to a man who doesn't love her, Sita ends up in Northern California where her niece is planning her own wedding to a man she doesn't love. In between, there is love, hate, fear, violent death, misery, resignation, and joy, all told with an empathy that resonates, and a plot that pulls one along and made it difficult to put down the book.I'd recommend this novel to anyone interested in human drama, and to readers of Indian novelists such as Jhumpa Lahiri or Chitra Divakaruni.It's published by a small Indian house. I found Amazon the easiest way to find this book."
3,Only the eyes are mine,The story starts out fine. However the ending did not seem right as the logic for the sudden change in heart was not clear. I think there was too much generalization and stereotyping. Overall an enjoyable novel.
5,Great syrup,Had some of Cheri's prickly pear syrup while vacationing in Tucson. Great to find it availble so we can never run out.
4,Everything I Need,"Robert Crenshaw's ""Full Length Stereo Recordings"" is ten years old, released on the independent label Gadfly. The recording engineering is a bit thin, lending a sound that might sound best on cheaper speakers. Crenshaw's catchy melodies like on the opener ""All I Want To Do Is Be With You"" sparkle like a pop confection with a recipe from the 60s. ""She's Not You"" is a delightful track, ""She's got everything I need and I want, but she's not you."" Robert covers the Bacharach song that Herb Alpert had a hit with, ""This Guy's In Love With You."" ""When the Rain Comes Down"" & ""Half a Heart"" are also strong tracks. So much of this set smokes, it's a shame that it can't be remastered and re-released to atone for the sub-par engineering. Enjoy!"
1,The audio equivalent of gut wrenching cramps,"Slightly better than Soulforce revolution, but utterly horrlible as well... See the review of soulforce revolution for the skinny.Rinsey beat the hell out of this album with his hamfists and called it !@#!#$That's what Rinsey does"
3,Slow moving,"I had high hopes for this DVD, since I'm a big fan of giant monster movies. But Negadon started so slowly, with emphasis on how beautiful everything looked instead of getting to the monster action. Negadon itself was a very boring monster, not very ""monstrous"". The climatic battle was over too fast. More time should have been spent on the monster battle instead of the artsy build-up. Still, I'd rather watch this than some boring big studio slasher flick."
3,"Mildly interesting, but overpriced","This movie is much too short (approximately 25 minutes), and only about five minutes of that involves giant monster/giant robot action (which, after all, is the only reason for watching these films in the first place).The closeup cityscapes were nicely done, and the humans weren't badly animated, but the spaceship designs and orbital views of Earth and Mars were not very believable.Worth watching, but not worth buying at full price."
1,charmless.,"It's kinda hard to believe this strobey, gray and drab looking masturbatory exercise in CGI is the ""tribute"" to classic kaiju movies that it's billed as being. The action, art direction, monster and robot all look painfully contemporary.The choice to render this feature digitally, along with the choice to give the story's heavy hitters a more ""now"" look ultimately kill any charm this retro wannabee could have had.If you are a fan of classic Japanese giant monsters, and you don't mind your colorful vintage rubber suitmation kaiju being subverted by tedious videogame imagery, then you'll love it.I didn't."
3,Negadon-Great CGI,"Seeing the trend of movies like this and some animation you get what you pay for. With Negadon, mind you you get a great CGI story, but you are mislead as to its total entirity. The Story is 25 minutes, but the label states 70 minutes, the remainder of the 70 minutes consists of background and trailers. I spent $15.00 hoping that it (the main story) would be longer, but it still worth getting anyway."
3,Negadon- a nod to the old school,"In case you don't know, this short film was created entirely on computers kinda like the short that eventually became ""Sky Captain..."". So that said, the creator does an awesome job of making this film look like it came from the golden age of Godzilla films. From the design of the space ships and monsters to the scratches and color of the ""film"". My inner child was jumping for joy. Not only that but he has composed some beautiful shots, cool perspective angles and dramatic slow motion.The problem with it is he tries to tell too much story in too little time. I didn't care about all that, maybe in a full length feature it would be relevant. But in this case, i wanted to see more destruction and the monster vs robot battle.All in all, it's very cool and worth the money."
1,NEGADON,Did not like this movie at all! Waste of film. Did not know it was CGI-Computer Generated Images. Don't waste your money.
5,Petain's Image,"A well documented and scholarly researched look into the life of a controversial figure from both world wars. Here is portrayed a man who was caught inbetween the Allies and the Germans after the fall of France in 1940. Instead of choosing either side outright, he opted to save French civilization by adopting a conciliatory stance toward Germany while at the same time playing a semi-secret role against Germany by not severing contacts with the British and Americans. The work also details the strange official relationship between unoccupied (Vichy) France and the United States that existed even into the invasion of North Africa by the Americans. It's hard to put this book down."
3,"Folows the series, but a bit is left out.","It's a good book for young fans of the Digimon TV series. This book roughly follows episodes 3 and 4, although it hints at the events in the first two episodes. It's also full of screen captures from the series as well as some new art and a color section in the middle."
3,Hall and Suzuki Save The Show!,"""Flower Drum Song"" was never top drawer Rodgers And Hammerstein to begin with plus ""I Enjoy Being A Girl"" and other material are of questionable value in today's social and political climate. However, this score is redeemed by the work of the great and underrated jazz vocalist Pat Suzuki and the brilliant musical theater character actress Juanita Hall. Both of whom save this musical from being a total travesty."
2,very long held poses,"After reading the previous reviews, I was hoping to finally get a DVD that would offer a true Yoga that focused on breathing and poses....yes they are here .....HOWEVER - THESE POSES GO ON FOREVER. IF anyone has any suggestions on any other Yoga videos on Amazon that will provide this without me staying in one position forever, please post! thanks!"
3,kind of a good book,"The tips are great,but the author doesn't know the names of the courses and some enemies. For the names of courses, check the bottom of the screen or press Start. You can find names of enemies from other video games;I would pick Mario Party 2. For example, ""pink bomb guys"" are really Bob-ombs.Thanks for reading!"
3,Not very clear on descriptions.,"I found the book to be only somewhat helpful. I did not find this book to be very clear on descriptions of the courses and how to find the stars. I felt that ""Super Mario 64 : Totally Unauthorized (The Super Mario Game Series)"" by Ronald Wartow and Christine Cain to be a much more helpful book."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!!,"THIS IS A GOOD BOOK ONLY IF YOU LIKE TO READ A LOT OF BLAH BLAH BLAH. I EXPECTED THIS TO BE A BOOK OF CHEAT CODES OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, AND IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST. IF YOU PUT A BOOK IN A LIST OF CHEAT CODE BOOKS, MAKE SURE IT IS JUST THAT. OTHER THAN THAT, IT WILL DO I GUESS, BUT IT IS TOOOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE INFORMATION GIVEN."
1,Self-Indulgent Tripe,"I feel sorry for the folks who financed this ""documentary."" It is merely the ""story"" of some person you've likely never heard of before and how he does plays in drag. I bought it thinking it was a movie version of the play, also entitled ""The Lady in Question"" (my local community theater is doing the play in the Spring and I was curious whether it was worth trying out for); instead, it's just this sad interview with those involved in this and other drag plays. Seriously, who cares. By all means, save your money."
5,Fantastic!,Charles Busch is an incredibly talented artist and this film is brilliant!I can't wait to see his guest appearance in Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell this week in New York at the Minetta Lane Theatre! It is suppose to be great!
1,No closed captioning,"I give this DVD a ZERO. Docurama didn't care enough to caption this DVD for hearing-impaired people.With the DVD being totally useless to us and all, I shouldn't care about saying anything nice about this DVD.Shame on you Docurama for NEVER captioning your DVDs all these years. :("
2,"Julian, What Were You Thinking?","Julian Sands is an actor whose work range from slightly bizarre to fabulous in period costume. As a fan, I've followed his career for years, however, Night Sun is not one of his better performances. The film is standard period melodrama with too much costume and little content. Although Sands attempts to bring life to a dreary storyline, he's overwhelmed by the maudlin and predictable characterization. Nothing works in this film, and perhaps most obnoxious is the dubbing. We all know what a beautiful voice Sands possesses, and to hear him dubbed is plainly irritating. The film is easily bypassed for better performances by this talented actor, and better storylines in film worth the attention such as A Room With A View."
4,Well written,"The book is very well written (and published). I enjoyed reading it. Having heard about the ""Rifleman"" in regard to information on sniping, I expected to find more detail in it on this subject. There aren't many. The ""Rifleman"" is more a story of the man's impression of the war, his theoretical and practical expertise of the warfare and some thoughts as to what the next war would be like. It was interesting to read the author's insights of 1930s on this matter, less than a decade prior to the WWII."
4,Sounds great.....,This album sounds real good. I esecially like track number 6 that sounds real laid back.
5,A classic Frisco album,"i didnt know about t lowe until about a year ago i heard him on some 11/5 and rbl stuff and thought he was tightbut didnt know he had any albums. i had a really hard time finding any of his albums i couldnt find them on this site or any local stores, then i finally found a site and i ordered it as well as Macaflama and primo stickin to da script. when i got it and listened to it i was not at all dispionted. he is a really talented rapper, as well as he had a lot of sicc beats. just about every song on the album was good there was only one that wasnt that good but other wise i would get the last one they have in stock its a great album."
2,Don't wear black cuz this movie will leave u scratching ur head,"The visuals and artistry were very good and surreal but whatever. The story/plot if there really was a cohesive one sucked. I mean, not like I think I'm all brainy and stuff but almost every review written had no clue where the movie was going and there were some professional reviewers too. I can appreciate leaving something to the imagination but come on! What happened to the humans? Where and why is the city underground (is it?).Super biomechanical machine that can alter a robot just laying around but not a single scrap of info to give the veiwer a hint at WTF is going on? It just seemed that this dude did not care enough to plug in the amazing number of plot holes. And because of that, it sinks like a ship. Now, I think that everyone should rent and watch this once. Why? Because misery loves company and I want you to suffer too. LOL! Oh BTW, I did not watch this CG expecting a hentia."
4,Nothing wrong with this one,"Boy did I struggle with which version of Gypsy to get... I finally decided on the original cast version and found that is was authentic, had a wonderful feel and pace and that, in fact, there was nothing wrong with this one. It is digitally remastered but still retains the ambience of the era. No one compares to Ethel. Her character jumps out to you in her interpretation of the songs. Who could do it better than the person it was written for. Written for her style, her voice, her power. The blend of voices in some of the other songs are fantastic. From intonation to timing and rythm, this recording was wonderful. If you want to get as close to the authentic intent of this show as possible- you'll want to get the original cast recording."
5,"Live or Recorded, Splender rocks!!!!!","I just saw these guys perform live at the Fillmore with Stroke 9 (another awesome band) and they just blew us all away. Not only did they have outstanding crowd control, but perfect vocals, harmonizing, and some outrageous guitar riffs. Their debut album is filled with the same, if not more, life as any other band out there and I hope they keep it going for many more albums and tours to come.Some highlight tracks off this CD are: ""I Think God Can Explain,"" & ""Supernatural"", But really, the whole CD is great!!!"
4,Halfway Down the Sky,"There is a lot of honesty on this album, both is the writing and in the actual execution of the songs. To borrow a kinda cheesy phrase: I felt the their pain.Songs like 'I Don't Understand', 'Yeah Whatever', 'Monotone', 'I Think God Can Explain' and 'London' come across very well. In the majority of the afore mentioned songs the emotion that went in to their writing and execution is apparent. That emotion is very refreshing in this age of pre-packaged pop.However, this album does have its downfalls. 'Spaceboy' lacks depth. 'I Apologize' has lyrics that are a bit on the mundane side. Also, 'Wallflower' is simply an unfocused mess. Finally, on an unrelated note, the albums moderate sprinkling of four-letter-words really does nothing to better it.In conclusion, if you're too intelligent for N'SYNC but not rough enough for Prodigy; I think Splender would be the most agreeable mediator for you."
5,One of my favs!,"I saw Splender live and thought I HAVE to get their album -- and boy, was I glad I did. It is such a soulful and moving CD. This band is one of those bands that has a way to play with words and get their point across in a way that some only wish they could. I also HIGHLY recommend seeing them live if you can - you won't regret it!"
4,Good alterna-pop,"So Splender might not be the most original or fresh of the batch. Doesn't mean they don't have talent. These guys are hard-working and it shows on their debut. The songs are tight and they work. ""Yeah, Whatever"" and ""I Think God Can Explain"" are easy radio-ready pop songs. Stuff like ""Monotone"" and ""Wallflower"" show the that the band wants to rock while on the dreamy ""London"" and ""Spaceboy"" they show a more sensitive side. I don't think Waymon, the singer, sounds like Hootie at all, in fact, I think he's much better. This band will grow and make even better discs than their debut"
2,boring but in a good way,i loved this album but when you move to tracks 6789... it kinda gets boring.. same way of expressing the songs nothing new or catchy. you'll like the first tracks but then what ? it's the same till the end. (caution: listen to samples carefully)
5,This is an awesome CD! :),"Hey i just wanted to let everyone know that i love this cd. i just got it and i found that i love almost every single song, and thats really rare for me. i listen mostly to rap but when i heard some of the songs on this CD i immediately fell in love with it. Anywayz, buy it - you'll like it. Listen to the first song and if you like that, then you'll like the rest of it! o:)"
3,Solid,"I was on the fence when I was trying to put the cover photo, song titles and band name together in my mind to attempt exactly what these guys might sound like.(I was in a hurry and didn't feel like waiting for an open disc player ) Anyway, when I saw who the producer was I snatched it up. I like it alot. Sure it's not perfect but it rocks from front to back. Excellent for intense walkman wearing workouts. Sort of a cross between T-E-Blind and the new Vertical Horizon sound."
3,"Splendor is good rock, yet is not quite perfect","If you like a good rock beat, and if you are not one who likes songs for their lyrics, Splendor is your kind of album. The lyrics are almost pseudo-intellectual, and have never done much for me. From a rhythmic standpoint, however, it is really great rock."
3,Caught between a Rock and a Hard Place.,"This album shows a lot of promise. The music is well arranged, however, the musicians leave a lot to be desired. I enjoyed the CD immensely, but they are so self absorbed it ruined the music."
3,"Above average, but many of the songs sound alike.","The album is pretty good if you can get past the very similar sounding tracks. I think they need more ""song style"" variety. However, the vocals are good and the lyrics are interesting."
4,Two Thumbs Up...,"It's hard to find a CD these days that has more than 1 or 2 good songs on it. Not only does Splender have a great overall CD but they have an original sound, one that doesn't sound like any other rock/alternative group out there. Another great thing about this group is that they sound as good LIVE as they do on the CD. I don't buy CD's that often, but after hearing this group LIVE in concert I bought the CD the next day."
5,Splendid Splender,"This CD is a collection of 13 brilliant tunes with catchy melodies and superb lyrics. Lead vocalist Waymon Boone sings with gusto, but does not shout. He writes words that are heartfelt, but not pretentious. Yet, the album is definitely not the result of a one-man-show. The whole band comes together and plays music that makes one sit up and listen intently. The songs are just so listenable! The emotions are evident, but not overcharged, and that's why these songs are so wonderful. No silly expletives, no needless swearing, just some honest-to-goodness musicmaking. This album has T-A-L-E-N-T written all over it. Give it a try, you WON'T be sorry."
4,A bit above average.,"The album is overall good. Songs such as ""Cigarette"", and ""I think God can Explain"" make it a winner overall, but it has it's downward moments. At times it seems to drag down and fall into a ""monotone"" vibe..."
1,Foul mouth imitation of Doves,"I had high hopes for this album when I first began to listen to it.Too much noise, obscures the bands musical abilities if they have any.Too flat, little to no dynamic range or change of tempoToo foul mouth, yes we all learned the bad words in 7th grade, no need to demonstrate your command of Junior High English.I'm sure if I listened carefully to the lyrics, there would be much to criticize.Four star album, really?"
1,too mild to matter,"Good god, are these guys bland. The singer sounds like he wants to be passionate but just can't quite muster up the energy. The songwriting is straight out of the alternarock radio handbook. It's all so reasonably melodic (though not particularly catchy), well-produced, accomplished, articulate, etc. that it turns into mush. I got to track 9, ""I Apologize,"" and just couldn't take it anymore. It's not horrible, I suppose, if you're a fan of mainstream top-40 rock, but I can think of hundreds of albums I'd rather spend my time with."
1,Pyle rca adapter,"I have purchased many Pyle products. Most have been of good quality. However this on is a miss. Previous Pyle marine RCA adapters I have purchased were robust in their design. This one is of poor quality. I purchased two of them and they both have the same design flaw. The whole apparatus is held together with a flimsy 1mm thick nut threaded onto the female end of the RCA cord (if you blow up the picture you can see what I am describing). The nut will not stay connected to the RCA cord and the cord is not melded to the plastic marine drilled socket mount. When the wee lil nut falls off (which it will) the RCA cord falls out of the socket mount. Poor design, would not recommend. The old design was outstanding - I believe they still ship that one along with the marine amp/speaker system."
2,It does its job but it is made poorly.,Bought this item for a custom stereo install on my boat. The threads that hold the input jack to the dashboard or wherever you decide to mount it are very poor and strip easily.
5,A True Love Story,"Congratulations Annette! Your book grabbed my heart from the first page. Having went to high school with Devin, it was also gut wrenching to read of the pain and suffering. There were many times I had to put it down for a day or so until I could be emotionally prepared to continue. Extremely well written in that it exposes the raw characteristics of each character. Just what an author is supposed to do. Thank you for sharing your life through Devin with me."
5,Very handy,"These trays are excellent for keeping little bits and pieces in one place. We used this while renovating our home, and I can't tell you the number of times it saved our bacon! Good strong magnets make this a great purchase."

1,Should be reported to the FTC for mislabelling,"Utter rubbish, a con, as this cynical German tourist insists on giving his pathetic technique and compositional ""skills"" the aura of authority by mislabellng his muzak ""flamenco"".If you like this schlock, then good for you, but real flamenco aficionados will be conned if they buy this."
4,Very nice,"I bought this album at one of his concerts! (You have to see this guy play live if you can!) The album is solid, there are 3 great songs (Verano de alegrias, Ballad for santana, and spanish steps) There's also a version of ""2 the night"" which is originally in the NOUVEAU FLAMENCO album. Overall this album is good. I did not give it 5 stars because it does not reach the level of NOUVEAU FLAMENCO or BORRASCA which are by far his best works!"
3,"Not bad; not to my personal tastes, but okay...","This CD was recommended to me when I inquired about Spanish guitar. No go, especially if you have Andres Segovia in mind. This is more an atmospheric CD, the kind you would expect to be played in the lobby of an upscale restaurant. Not bad in its own way, and it does lend a nice Latin flavor to one's home or business. Liebert does a good job, and this CD would be ideal as background music in a place where you want music to be there but somewhat unobtrusive."
3,Could be better,"While Innamorare is certainly another example of Liebert's strong talent, I don't think it is his best work. Nearly every track seems to focus on catchy little phrases that are repeated mercilessly. For someone looking for an introduction to Ottmar Liebert, I recommend either Nouveau Flamenco or Borrasca, both of which are loaded with passionate and imaginative music."
1,VHS never came!,"This VHS never came. I wrote the person who was to have sent it. She said it must have disappeared in the mail. So I can't review the product like I would like to. I love Bill Gaither, especially the Homecoming VHS's and DVD's. I'm sure it would have been great if I had received it!!!"
4,Nice Bike Rack,"This is a nice bike rack, we use it inside our garage, so the kids bikes are standing up and organized. Only two issues: on two of our bikes (kids BMX) the front tire is too big to fit between the bars, so we have to ""back it in"" and park it with the back tire. The other issue is that 6 bikes really don't fit. I found that only 4 bikes fit comfortably, two on each side of the rack at the ends. If you try to put one in the middle it is almost impossible.Overall, I really like the bike rack, it's very easy to assemble and light weight."
1,No! No! No!,Please do not use this style of bike parking rack outside. It is impossible to lock your bike properly. This design comes from the days when bikes where not stolen -- before any of us were born.
3,This is only half the album it should be.,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this is better than nothing, but it is only a compilation from the two original albums.The theme is the major disappointment. What I would really like to see is the cd issue of ""The Girl From UNCLE"" which has the authentic version of the original theme and a release of a double album in lieu of this abreviated selection.If you're going to do something. Do it right."
2,This does not contain any original scores used in the show.,The quality of scores in this CD is far below the level of original ones actually used in the show. What's worse it totally ignores scores adopted in the third and fourth season of the series. I wish Turner would release the all the original scores from the master tapes from MGM library including the film version.
2,"Brings back memories, though not enough quantity & quality","This so-called soundtrack is better than nothing, and a couple of tracks are pleasing to the ear, but much of the show's memorable music from its 4-year run is ignored. Worst of all, the great theme song, whether its different incarnation from each of the four seasons, sounds terrible here. Can't wait for an authentic soundtrack boxed-set to be released. This one is better than nothing, but not much better."
3,Not Enough,"Although this did bring back memories of a truly entertaining series, it could have been better. The tracks were short, but the quality was clear. If you'd like to hear a 'blast from the past' then this album is for you. It just needed to be longer, that's all."
3,Formula gangster pic with nothing new to offer,"Since Little Caesar and Al Capone, gangster films by this time had a plot formula to follow: poor thief follows plan to take over the mob and replace the boss, climbs the ladder to the top only to meet an end of raining bullets. Ray Danton is well cast in the leading part but character actor Jesse White is hard to believe as a tough mafia leader and Elaine Stewart wears almost a disguise to play Arnold Rothstein's tough moll. Good performances help a cliched story, but it's been filmed before too often."
3,Not as good as first 2 books,"As others have said, this book just did not deliver. I loved Simon and Meghann's character's and they were 3 dimensional while Jimmy, Ellie, and Mikal were 1-2 dimensional. They were just ....are you kidding, these are Simon and Meghan's children (Ellie and Mikal, not Jimmy). To reiterate, Jimmy was very annoying, the story w/ him and Ellie is NOT believable for many reasons. The addition of incest was not shocking as it was in Flowers in the Attic, but it was ""ok, ok, I predicted this"". But the first two books of this series are AWESOME!"
2,A disappointing end,"I was really shocked at just how bad this book was. I wasn't too happy about the pregnancy from the get go. It's a trite and cheap plot trick. But I thought Bakers would do something interesting with it as her previous books had been so enjoyable. Boy, was I wrong.What in the hell? Simon and Megan are barely together. And when they finally are, it feels like they're cousins up there. The emotion was just sucked right out of this book and all the characters. Which is what made M fall flat as an antagonist. You can't make someone be evil just for the sake of being evil.End the series with Crimson Night. You'll be happier for it."
5,Flush Times,"You push the flush handle, and the toilet flushes. After a bit, the flapper closes, and the tank fills up, ready for another flush. For some reason, this is the only flapper valve that works with the Eljer one piece toilets that we have."
1,Awful,"I purchased this as a replacement flapper for my Eljer toilet. Unfortunately, it only works with certain models...mine not being one of them. But if you think it will fit your toilet, beware....The chain attached to the flapper is only FOUR inches long! With no way to attach a longer one to it. How in the heck are you supposed to make that work?? Also the bulb that sticks out from the bottom is made of Styrofoam!!! Don't think that's going to last long! I ended up going to Home Depot and getting a universal flapper that hooked up quickly and works great!"
5,Making the glass lighter,"We all understand life by looking ""through a glass, darkly."" Buechner, poetically as usual, tackles some of the why, for why it's so hard and scary for us to really see the truths about God. Buechner divides the book into ""The Search,"" our responsibility to seek God to fill our hungering dark, and ""The Sought,"" God's ever-present desire to bring us to him.Buechner is poignant and insightful. Each chapter is complete and yet leaves the reader hanging on for more. It's like the reading equivalent of savoring a piece of cheesecake."
4,Freaky alien potato?,"This DVD is full of lovely art work, great character designs, a promise of a supernatural story that spans the centuries. And a freaky alien dog that is named Potato and seems to understand everything said to him. Love the voice talents,such as Vic Mignogna, Monica Rial, Kira Vincent-Davis, and there are a ton of them in the credits I know and have even met in person. The feel is wonderful. A mixture of romantic hope and dark fantasy. There is an underlining feel of doom and death just around the corner. The first DVD is full of promise. But it lacks a touch, that spark, that makes a nice anime into a great one. Maybe the dog makes it too cute. I would suggest getting it used."
1,I did not like this book,I read this book from cover to cover hoping for some redeeming value - I didn't find any. It was a filthy book in my estimation - I felt like I was in the middle of the 60's drug culture. The book was thrown away.
5,Continues Hersey's fine journalistic skills. . .,in fictional form. Here are Hersey's statements about alienation in the modern world. Some readers could be alienated by The Collector (c.f. John Fowles)-like story line.
3,Great Recording Falls Short,"I have a previous EMI CD issue of Klemperer's 4th Symphony which is complimented by the equally great 3rd Symphony. Some stores still carry it. This compilation, however, is nowhere near as great even though Klemperer's recording of the 4th is the greatest and most colorful I have ever found. Better recordings are still available of the Academic Overture such as Sony Classics' George Szell or if you want nostalghia, RCA Victor's Toscanni. The Schumann Overtures have a historical context since Schumann was one of Brahms' mentor but I frankly don't see how anyone could be satisfied with the overtures after hearing the intense, expansive chords of Brahms' 4th. Possibly Klemperer's recording of 'Fingal's Cave by Mendelssohn would have been more suitable.I'll settle for the older Cd version with the 3rd Symphony. That would would be the 'Klemperer Legacy' at its finest."
1,"Quanitity, not quality","This volume has tons of haunted places listed, but presents them each as a capsulized summary of others' research and writeups. They have an impressive listing of resources and give due credit to all, but they don't seem to add anything of their own to the descriptions. Most of the listings are one page or less, with there being some double spread pages that contain parts of four different entries. This guide is helpful purely as a directory (in the same way the yellow pages would be) but has no feel of personal investment or enjoyment. If you have access to this book, my recommendation would be to use the ""Resources"" section for each state to identify books and authors for more indepth and enjoyable reading."
2,Not my cup 'o tea...,"As much as I respect Dick Dale and his unequaled place in surf-rock history, this album just didn't cut it for me. While his ability will still 'wow' you, I found too much of this album somewhat derivative, especially of things he himself had done earlier. Even worse, a couple of tracks I even found boring. Of course, not all the album is bad. Songs such as 'Nitrus' will make you sit up and take notice, but I found those moments lacking for the most part. Your time may be better spent searching out some of Dale's earlier, more inspired work."
4,Easy to read and interesting,"This book consists of several essays that address various facets of Mormon history and Mormon culture, especially in the West and in Utah, though many of the things Stegner writes about aren't Mormon at all but just take place in predominantly Mormon areas.The author touches on the interesting Deseret alphabet--a bizarre, phonetic alphabet that Mormon leader Brigham Young tried to get all Mormons to learn--on missing artist-explorer Everett Ruess, on the settlements along the Colorado River, and on the effects Mormon culture had on local Indian tribes.Stegner seems to really like and admire the Mormons, though he was never one himself, and his book is almost always fair, and at times even loving, to them.This is an enjoyable read for anyone interested in these parts of the West, particularly in Utah and the Colorado Plateau. It's also well indexed and can be easily used as a reference. It's one of Stegner's best, for sure."
4,Mormon Country,"As a non-Mormon, I have always been fascinated with a faith that has remained strong and isolated, even when it resides in the midst of much misunderstanding. Much of this secrecy seems to be intentional. In Mormon Country, Stegner breaks through a part of this secrecy and gives the outsider insight into who the Mormons are and how they live. There is not much about their faith, but much about their lives and society.Since the book is now over sixty years old, it reflects a time that has been lost. It tells stories that may well have been first or second hand accounts of the founding of the Mormon Country. The writing is crisp and moves easily. This is interesting reading for anyone interested in getting a basic understanding of wh the Mormons are and how they live."
5,"Excellent, clear, readable","As a gardener who's been looking at online soil maps, I wanted to know a little more about soil and the meaning of some of these terms. Reading this book has been immensely helpful and generally enjoyable - I can understand it, and it makes sense. College chemistry being more than 20 years behind me, some things like clay chemical structure have been difficult to make sense of, and there's a lot of specialized vocabulary that's made the soil classification chapter unclear. But in general, I'm amazed that I can read this book without huge mental effort and chapter after chapter it continued to be understandable. The only complaint is that there are no photographs, and a good number of the illustrations provide no help or are less clear than they could be - I think some better illustations would help clarify clay chemical structure.I highly recommend this book."
3,Textbook review,"I find this book to be very informative and the price is much more reasonable than most books chosen as textbooks for these types of classes.The information is brief and to the point, which may be a plus in some cases and may be a detriment in other cases, but that's what the instructor is for, filling in the blanks."
3,"Enjoyable, But Not As Good As Velvet Rope","I enjoyed this video but in my opion, it was not as good as the Velvet Rope video. I though the song selections, dancers, costumes, camera work, etc., were better in Velvet Rope. Live In Hawaii, has a few of Janet's newer songs and that is nice, but the camera seems too far away from the stage. I would have liked some crisper close up shots. Also, the band is hidden most of the time behind the backdrop, except when she brings the guitar player out. So you can't really see the musicians performing. I'd say get this only if you already have Velvet Rope and are desperate for more Janet."
3,Not an inspiring performance,"Janet is a Jackson and so her ""good"" performance would qualify as someone else's ""great."" Perhaps it's because it was the last show of the tour, but it feels overly rehearsed and uninspiring. If you've ever seen Michael in concert, you'd see the difference. Michael gives you his all. Janet does a good job, but it's not like she's giving you her all."
1,oh boy,"In comparison to her other concerts, this one is the lowest most boring thing I ever seen done by Janet. I couldn't even watch the whole concet. Too boring!"
2,"Janet, your losing it but i want to be together again","Janet, come on. Growing up with your genius brother Michael, you should have learned how to put on a concert. Remember you going backstage in his 1988 Bad Tour in Japan. You and your mom were right there. Remember how he moved an audience. I haven't seen that in your concerts. The audience is just standing there. In Michael's they are fainting, crying, jumping, moving, hands up, waving arms, and going crazy. He puts on an electrifying performance and he makes it look so natural. You on the other hand at this stage make is look so forced and so rehearsed.I know you are no where near the talents of Michael Jackson, but you sure put on a good concert for the Velvet Rope and also put on a good concert I attended during your Rythym Nation tour. Come on Janet, lets be together again.I have your concert taped, but I have all of Michael Jackson's concerts as well."
2,Good Exercise Video,"This could be a 5 star exercise video but as for music it is 2 stars. I was thinking that maybe Janet would be in the same league as Madonna, Britney, Cher, Kylie, Christina... and found this dvd to have good costumes, sets, etc but the music and singing was not at all in the same league as those mentioned. This one is not a keeper."
1,Boring,"I think this concert was pretty typical and boring. This show is pretty identical to her previous concerts. She barely sings live through the show. It's basically Janet lipsynching to her songs as she dances. Nothing very original here. Her dancing is remarkable, however she lacks in most other areas. She is no Queen of Pop or Dance. I would pass on this DVD."
4,Great show.... in person and on DVD :),"I went to this show back in February with a friend, but was not initially going to go. I enjoyed it immensely, and the fact it was being filmed was great also! I had never been to a filmed concert before. One thing that you may not know, is that at the actual show, things were kinda messed up. The whole opening sequence went wrong when the dancers came down on the elevated platforms. When they got to the bottom, Janet et al. just walked off stage! We then had to wait a bit, and a guy came out and explained they were going to do it again! It was rather funny, but I'm sure Janet was mad! So what you see on the dvd, was actually a spliced version of two different opening sequences since the pyrotechnics did not occur the second time around. Anyway, the concert was ace, and I would recommend this DVD to anyone into Janet or the current state of Pop/R&B music today."
4,Lipsynchapaloza!,"Wow.... its not only Britney who doesnt know the words to her own songs enough to lipsynch the right lines or times, but at least Janet re-recorded her vocals to SEEM live. Its a pretty entertaining show. It at times gets boring (alright, whymsical medly) but has its high points. Its a very good performance. In my opinion the best out of the three HBO chicks who did a concert (madonna janet and britney)Janets amazing outfits and interesting choices for the set make this show worth the pricy-for-a-dvd cost."
5,Awesome!,"Janet always puts on the best concerts! There isn't any other female artists with as many hits as Janet, and is still out there performing! Janet's a natural on stage, and the choreography and dancing is incomparable! She works the mic, the stage, the outfits and the crowd! ""Janet- Live in Hawaii"" is a must have for music lovers and Janet fans everywhere!!! Don't forget to get yourself ""The Velvet Rope Concert!"" That's another concert you'll definitely enjoy!!!"
5,electrifying!,"I own this DVD and I have to say that it's amazing. The full concert is great, but it's quite a little porn and sexual, watch the intro video, when se runs to the water, you can see all of her breast, and I think the special feature where are 5 performances of Would You Mind is very hot! when you see how she performs that song, you'll believe me!It is a great DVD, and it has 26 live performances! I don't know how does it last only 1hr 54min.The best performances in the concert are:-Trust A Try-You Ain't Right-Son Of A Gun (Missy Elliott sings it with her)-That's The Way Love Goes-If-Would You Mind (oh, my God!)-Doesn't Really Matter-Together Again-Rythm NationThere are also outtakes in the middle of the concert, when a songs finishes, the camera records Janet changing her clothes.It's very exciting, but you'll love it!"
1,Beat it in 4 hrs,"Sure the game is fun for the extremely short time it can provide new levels. I assumed there were 8 levels of 3 or 4 worlds each, but there are about 8 total worlds to beat and they are not that difficult. granted I played it on Normal setting (there are 3 difficulty setings, normal is the lowest) but that does not mean there are really 24 boards, it's still the same game. One should not be able to beat any game on any system in the same day one opens the package, no matter how hard you try. All DS games have this problem to a greater or lesser degree I find, but this is ridiculous. At least I only paid something like 8 bucks for it in the first place; Now I know why."
3,Okay,This game is basically a classic space shooter game with better effects. It's not incredibly fun IMO.
5,Best DS game yet!,This is in my opinion the best game for the Nintendo thus far. The best past aboutit is the ability to register high scores on the Nanostry website. The graphics are excellent and the controls are easy to pick up. Well worth the price.
4,A great vertical scroller,"Definately a fun game, but the learning curve is rather steep. If you like vertical scroller games similar to Raiden or Raptor: Call of the Shadows, this game is atleast worth a try."
4,a quick adrenaline rush!,"This is the kind of game that you play if games like the original Starfox for the SNES appeal to you. Don't expect incredible depth, but rather, gaze at the awesome graphics and music while blasting a bunch of ammo at waves and waves of oncoming enemies. I love it. The only drawback is that the game is waay too short for the money- I would say a good three hours is enough to beat this game from the moment you pick it up if you are a seasoned gamer. With that said, I can never get sick of replaying this game because the graphics and superficial flashiness are kind of addictive to me. If you are expecting a hardcore shoot-em-up on the level of Ikaruga, you will definitely be disappointed."
4,Decent 2D shooter,"This was a pretty fun game to play to pass time. The boss battles had a good enough challenge to it. The graphics were better than expected on the DS. I enjoyed this enough to put Nanostray 2 on my wish list, because the reviews say it is better than the first."
2,No suspense or mystery in this book,"I gave this series a try based on the author's other series. I was not only disappointed but couldn't find the suspense or mystery in this book. Too much filler that dilutes the story. Making the reader go to the end of the book and read the last chapter. The characters are not well developed,nor do they keep your interest. I would try the second book in the series only to see if there's improvement in the series."
4,Great First Mystery in the Joanna Brady Series,"I LOVE Joanna Brady! However, this introduction to her and her life in Bisbee is NOT the best book Jance has ever written. One thing that is terrific about Jance, though, is that she is from Bisbee and describes the town in exact detail. Bisbee is a quaint crazy town and Jance grabs all of the details of that small town oasis in the desert. Joanna Brady is a likeable character and the series gets beter and better as time goes by. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
4,Desert Heat Is A Great Read!,"Reading Desert Heat, the first volume in the JoAnna Brady series, is all it takes to make you a J. A. Jance fan. The adventures of the lady sheriff in the small southwest town hold your interest right up to the last page. The characters become like old friends and once you make a connection with these characters, you are hooked. In other words, Desert Heat is a great read!"
3,Audiobook review - Drinking Game,"Ellen Travolta reading Desert Heat - Drinking game:Take a sip every time Ellen:- makes noise while swallowing saliva- makes paper noise while changing a book page- mispronounces any simple american word- mispronounces an Arizona landmark- uses the wrong emotion when reading a dialog- sounds like this is the first time she ever laid hands on the book she's reading- makes Joanna Brady sound like she's 60 years old and not in her early 20's- takes unnecessary pauses in the middle of a sentenceDrunk before the end of chapter 1, guaranteed!Do you know what is worse? She also read the other books of the series..."
2,Where's the plot?,"Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less."
5,We will all like this not only the baby.,"I have already had one of these CD's and we all love it.I have two Grandchildren arriving soon,so I am ordering another.I feel this will be a good stimulant for a baby. We have not been a fan of classical music but this has been a hit."
1,Baby Mozart Mislead,"I love the CD Baby Mozart!! I played it during my pregnancy with my last child and wanted to do the same this pregnancy. However, when I purchased this item from this seller I was sent the wrong item. The headline stated it was a CD of Baby Mozart, however, when I received the product it was a cassette tape with no case. I was throughly disappointed as I will be reordering another item from another seller. The paper they submitted stated it was a cassette, however, over the net no where did it state it was a cassette. The headline clearly stated.... Baby Mozart CD"
3,MOZART STRIKES FALSE CHORD,"NEW YORK, Jul 22 (Reuters Health) -- The ""Mozart effect"" -- a reported temporary increase in intelligence after listening to a Mozart piano sonata -- does not hold up in repeat studies, according to a report published in the journal Psychological Science.There is ""little evidence to support basing intellectual intervention programs on the existence of the Mozart effect,"" according to researchers led by Dr. Kenneth Steele, an assistant professor in the department of psychology at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina."
3,"Great movie, nice to see the original version but very basic","If you are a fan of this movie, this is fun to watch because you can see the original cut with the original audio. However, the quality was not updated and, overall, this is a very basic DVD. If you are looking for a special edition, this really isn't that special."
1,pursuit of the graf spee,yes i sent a email back to the coustomer and you an got no respond. i wrote and told the coustmoor that when i ordered this movie they said it was in english. i cant even watch it. i would like to know if he has one in english an if so can i exchance this one for that one?
2,One word for this cd.........BLAH!,"I was very dissappointed that the song 808 wasn't anything close to the version that is played on the radio, which is why I bought the cd to begin with. I felt that I was misled as a consumer. The rest of the cd seemed to be OK, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends."
2,2 only because....,"i like 808. the other songs are so insipid, and they girls have NO talent. if i could give a half of a score, i would only because hearing jc chasez say ""thug appeal"" is comical, to say the least. DON'T buy this waste of a CD!"
2,A Weak Album,"The vocals on this album are average at best and weak in my opinion. The song ""I do"" sounds like it would be a theme song for a pre-teen show on Nick or something. I only liked ""Bring it all to me"" and their cover of ""Time After Time."" The rest of this album is typical girl group filler."
1,What happened to the 808 remix?,"I was really dissapointed when I bought the CD, and the 808 remix wasn't there. However, at Express stores they have a CD with lots of cool songs, featuring the 808 REMINX!"
3,Very Good album; Trackmasters shine!,Undoubtably this is one of the first full-length albums to feature the work of the Trackmasters who have been able to work out commercial joints without sounding wack. I suggest Blaque as a wonderful introduction to the slow R and B jam style but I would prefer 50 Cent's album Power of the Dollar for the best introduction to the epitome of what the Trackmasters can do.
2,TO TOO SWEET,"This album really disappointed me. It seemed like all there songs should have been on some Disney movie soundtrack not a whole CD. If they did try to be like TLC maybe there album would have been better. TLC was sharp and straight to the point. Blaque's Cd is oozing with sweet goody goody tracks. The only good one's where 808 and Bring it All to Me. Maybe on there next album they will ""mature"" like everyone else does on there second album."
4,Pretty good and finely-trimmed.,"I like this debut album because it's evident that Blaque really worked hard to combine a unique blend of sounds to form this LP. The reason why I give it 4 stars is because I think that Blaque sounds a tad-bit proper (by that i mean they sound like they're white) and why any R&B group would want to remake Cyndi Lauper's poppish/rock 'Time After Time' is a mystery in itself. The best songs on this CD are 'Roll With Me,' 'Rainbow Drive,' 'Stay By Your Side,' and 'Mind Of A King.' All in all, an impressive album."
3,It's pretty good!,I went and seen 'N Sync in concert and they were one of the opening acts.They are ok.No one will ever compare to 'N Sync.I like the song I Do.It's pretty good.I want the cd because 'N sync is featured on the cd.
5,Tight,BLAQUE IS SOOOO TIGHT!!! THEY ARE PRETTY AND GOOD SINGERS. MY FAVORITE SONG IS 808 BECAUSE I BE GOIN' BOOM LIKE AN 808!!!
2,this is not whate you expect,"this cd has to much rap. i thought it would be like tlc were in the no scrubs video there was rap except not on the cd. in i do from the Blaque cd they kept the ""can nobody tell me bordikin cus i be lovin my man wat i shood of said: if you like rap this cd is great. i expected an r&b cd"
2,hmm,"Sadly disapointing.There are some tracks that stand out (3) but the trio do not offer much lyrically. I cant grasp the concept of the song ""Lenny."" Is this song an acronym or is it dedicated to a Lenny. The interludes are annoying. But on another note they did a good job with the remake of ""Time after Time, "" but the songs that were radio air played were as good as it gets (if you even liked those) ""Bring it all to me"" and ""808."" ""rainbow drive"" nice message but the approach is lacking creativity. If music is supposed to be a form of expression minus having to make sense or being a stimuli then this cd is great!"
3,"Nice debut, somewhat disappointing","Blaque explodes onto the scene with their smash hit ""808"" produced and written by R.Kelly. The follow up to their smash hit ""Bring It All To Me f/ Nsync"" offers a nice somewhat new type of sound and is very infectious, great potential. Other notable tracks is the Motown-styled song ""I Do"", which somewhat touches more on Pop music sounds, the soulful ballad ""When The Last Teardrop Falls"", and the racial unity-based track ""Rainbow Drive"". However, some of the songs somewhat leave you disappointed due to the quality of their recent hits. In my opinion, only about half of the album is really good, but they should really try to do better next time around."
1,"Please ,,","If you want this cd Sample it please I know they could have did better than that. this album is so Corny I like three songs out of fourteen and that's not even average. If you want this album buy it used. not brand new i payed 16.99 for this album. I was very upset with this group. Everyone told me that I need to trade in this album. And no the 808 bumpin remix is not on here. If torch is relesed, Which I hope will be. I hope it's better than This."
2,Kinda disappointed,"Okay, This is the lowest rating I've ever given a CD. and Believe me I'm a pretty easy on the Stars. I have to this CD just... well.. to put it bluntly sucked. I hate saying that, but I listen to it for about 2 months before I am judging it. So, I tried to give it time... maybe I would grow to the CD but .. nope. I find myself skipping through song after song. Yes, there are cool songs, but not compare to the sad ones. There cover of Time after Time was sad. I was Disappointed that 808 was different then what was played on the radio, because that was the main reason i bought the cd. I think their next cd will be better ...give them a chance that was after all there first Cd...."
3,Good going but originality is important,"I really like Blaque the new addition to 3 girl R&b groups but I think the production of this album was very mediocre. Especially since they're being compared to other groups they would want to stray away from unnecessary sampling but they do the opposite.Plus the album sounds like a little kids album (whats up with that!). I think the sophmore album should be much better though they just need to mature.Best songs are Don't go looking for Love (written by Mariah), Roll With Me and Bring it all to Me w/N Sync(even though they're trying to sound thuggish)."
3,"Thumbs ""sideways"".....","More songs like the wonderful ""Rainbow Drive"" would have given this CD more definition and direction toward the next level..."
5,these girls are jamming,"so far I like there 808 and the remix is jamming I can't wait for the lp too hit the stores, good luck girlz always dj lenny ge san diego"
5,Believing in Life and Achieving a Quest for Unity in Everything,"I remember this album when I was in the 7th grade. I fell in love with this album and played it out. They explored uncharted grooves with this album. This album blends soulful R&B with a funky alternative vibe. Each member has a distinctive sound: Brandi's sweet vocals,Shamari's powerful soul stylings,and Natina handles the rap installments. They explored variety of sounds. Their philosophy was Fashion Forward and Musically Advanced. This album has been certified Platinum. Remember,this was 1999-2000."
5,Blaque Going To The Top!!!,"When I bought this CD, I was expecting just a few girls wanting to make a CD. Boy o boy was I wrong. These girls made outstanding tracks and have touched the hearts of many fans. I think there best songs out would have to be ""Bring It All To Me"", ""808"", and ""I Do"". These songs are so good you just want to fall asleep listening to them. And this spring, there making an even better album! I suggest you listen to the album and write a review just like I did. Let the girls touch your heart."
4,Weyyuuuuhl. . .,"Okay, the first time I listened to the CD I didn't like it very much but later again I listened to it and realized it was a quality CD although it doesn't live up to my expectations.(Talk about your run-on sentences.) I really like ""I Do"" but ""Bring It All To Me"" can get a bit annoying when you keep on hearing it ""Time After Time.""(LOL)When ""The Last Teardrop Falls"" is an awesome song, one of my favorites on the CD and there were a lot of good quality songs on the it. All in all, it was a great album. =)"
2,LITTLE TOO YOUNG,"THE GIRL OF BLAQUE ARE WAY TOO YOUNG TO BE IN A R&B WORLD.THE GIRLS ARE ONLY 17 ! AND LOOK AT 702 OR TLC..THEY ARE LIKE 24-30!THE GIRLS DON'T HAVE GREAT VOICES AND THE SONGS ARE DUMB EXCEPT FOR ""BRING IT ALL TO ME""(WITH NSYNC) AND ""808""."
5,Rules,"I really think the song ""808"" is like the coolest song. I can't wait to get the CD and here what the rest of their music sounds like. I also think that this group is going to be GREAT in music buisness in the future."
3,A QUESTION ABOUT BLU-RAY VERSION,"Yes, this is a cool, overlooked little gem.But what does the Blu-ray image look like? Is this a restored transfer, or a beat-up public domain print in HD?Has anyone seen this in HD?"
3,A jar of pickled clichés,"Certainly not a masterpiece with a terminating Humphrey Bogart and a debutante Lollobrigida. Two odd couples with crossing affairs lost in a small harbor no one knows where because their derelict ship has broken down, surrounded by a band of three or four would-be gangsters who are nothing but weak bad boys. They even end up with a taxi jumping into the ocean, an attempted murder by overboard throwing in the middle of some ocean night, a shipwreck that brings all that nice group of adventurers to some Morocco where they are forced to bribe the locals to get through, and that is not as easy as one may think. In other words quite a compilation of clichés. And yet it is some fun to see such naive queer composition that someone in Hollywood called a film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
1,First Return,"This DVD has the worst video quality I've ever seen. Actually, this DVD is the only return I made to amazon."
1,Beware Laserlight cheapies,"Terrific movie. My opinion of the DVD itself is what you're interested in, though.OK, apart from the Tony Curtis intro, this could have been a decent disc. The quality is about what you'd expect from a movie made ten years earlier, but that may be what we'll have to live with until Robert A. Harris decides to restore it.Unfortunately, the logo that Laserlight chose to put in the lower right corner, much like television stations can't resist doing these days, really ruins it. Not only does one not expect to have to put up with distractions like this on a disc that one pays for, but it shows up EVERY TEN MINUTES during the movie. It just shows how little class Laserlight has. You may as well tape it when it shows up on AMC."
1,Big Disappointment,"Our family settled down to watch this over the Christmas holidays with great anticipation. After all, wouldn't a movie with Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Robert Morely, Jennifer Jones, and Gina Lollabrigida be a stunner? Not! We literally couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of it, and even then people started talking and shuffling around while it was playing. The script was absolutely awful and the actors read their lines with a stiltedness that was exremely puzzling. I mean, these are all great actors! How come suddenly they can't act? See it yourself and go figure."
1,Boggie Musta Needed Da Moola,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid on TV..... wish that had been the last time I saw it. Bogart must have really needed the money to ( and I use the term loosely ) star in this debacle. Still, if you're sitting around with a bunch of drunk friends, it might be good for an unintentional laugh."
5,Best quality transfer available,"Apparently ""Beat the Devil"" must be in the public domain because there are so many inferior copies on the market. This one, by Laserlight, is definately the best I have seen and well worth the price. If you are a fan of black comedy and off-beat cinema, then this film is a must see. The actors are hilarious, especially Jennifer Jones, in a blonde wig, playing a compulsive liar. The DVD includes an introduction by Tony Curtis, discussing the career of Humphrey Bogart."
2,Missing the best tunes,How could you leave off 2 of the best songs the band has ever done The songs are Nazis and Third homosexual murderTThis is like the Pistols not having God Save The Queen or the Clash without Londons Burning.If your going to put out a best of make sure you put out the best of.
4,not bad for a bunch of guys poking fun at american history.,"Finally something to come out of Canada that's not so ""Painfully popular"" That we Americans can finally start to appreciate Canadian music. I must say though that this cd does nothing for the group as they seem to excel much more as a live act, then what they seem to come across on vinal as. With out being able to visualise what they actually are all about ( Edmonton, Sunset club... 1990) You lose some of the appreciasion for the group and there for they seem like some bubble gum rapper group capable of a few laughs. Lets see If they can stay away from the criminal zero, as in 0 for entertainment value and return more to their roots of good old fashion punk! Lets not become to complicated just stick to three courds."
2,The Cost of Maintenance,The light is well made and easy to hang. My problem with this light is I've had it for three weeks and had to replace two bulbs. The bulbs cost $5.50 each.When I installed the light I made sure not to touch the bulbs because the oil on your fingers can shorten the bulbs life.
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","This book has an interesting premise, sort of an ""X-Files"" theme, however, just about every other page has some social comment about men. This book is dedicated to Patricia, and while the author remains anonymous, I am pretty sure it is a woman with some really serious problems with the males of our species. I don't have a problem with the author's chosen lifestyle (to each his/her own,) but I do have a problem with the CONSTANT male-bashing throughout the book. The main character, who is female, apparently feels every man in her past and present is some base creature trying to take advantage of her. I can't tell you how many times I stopped reading because I was sick of being assaulted by the author's personal problems. Here's a hint A. A. McFedries - talk out your issues with Patricia, and leave the writing to the well-adjusted members of our society. Oh, and by the way, purchase a Thesaurus. There are other words for ""fear."""
4,"Not as good as ""The Gay Parade""","Of Montreal delivers another solid concept-album. This times, it's a story of some sort involving kidnapping, detectives... who knows what. The narrative is oblique, but the songs are generally tuneful, strange and well produced. There are experimental Olivia Tremor Control-style seques, little spoken word narrations, and other bits, but generally, it's pretty strong on a song-for-songs basis."
2,not what I had expected,"I'm not going to criticize the flash cards too much, for I did pass the a+ exam, but the flash cards were more of a foundation for the a+ exam. The exam questions were not at all like the flash cards. And the cd-rom that came with the flash cards could only be installed on a palm top, which I do not own. There were also alot of incorrect answers on the flash cards as well (I had my instructor look them over). If you took a class in preparation for the a+ exam, just study your notes. I would not recommend the flash cards to anyone."
2,Cheap,"I bought this to install a single din in dash DVD player. The trim piece that fills in the holes with for the old radio knobs broke as I was installing it, more specifically, the pin that you push the trim into the main piece broke, rendering the trim piece useless.EDIT: I purchased one from Crutchfield and theirs was MUCH better quality and it was cheaper too."
5,fits,"fits, cheap, installs easy, what more do you want? OMG it seriously wants me to type 11 more words. It holds up my pants."
1,Very cheaply made,"I ended up buying an installation kit from Crutchfield, much higher quality and only a few dollars more. This piece was a disappointment."
3,Good looking! But,This product looks good but is brittle and easy to break. Im shopping now for something a little stronger. The very next time I needed to remove my head unit after I installed It I broke the tabs off the upper trim piece
1,Sucks,Did not fit my dodge 2006 charger!Finally broke off a piece due to level of frustration and now I have to get another type.
1,Does not fit a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee,"I bought this receiver for my Jeep because I replaced my stock radio for a single DIN deck. But this product does not fit at all. The packaging even says, unlike the description online, that it's for 2005-2008 Chrysler/Dodge/Jeeps. But I didn't have any problems with returning it."
3,"Good product, but listed incorrectly.","Wanted to buy a after market deck for my 04 Dodge Ram 1500. Seller states that it will work, but when I got it it works for 06 Ram's and newer. So I had to spend the 20 bucks at best buy to get the one I needed. Seller had a good price, and fast delivery, but again mislabeled the product."
5,Worked great on my 2004 Dodge Durango!,Bought this kit to replace the radio in my 2004 Dodge Durango Limited with the stock 6-disc deck.Panels line up perfectly and I love the slot underneath the single DIN radio which is perfect for your iPod. The fit and finish was excellent. Highly recommended!
3,Entertaining enough,"I agree with a previous reviewer who found the mystical elements silly. Another way to put it is that there's an excess of sophomoric philosophizing.The alien cat person is vivid enough if trite. Vastly powerful ancient aliens loom menacingly if vaguely, as is still common in even the best of today's space opera.Harlan's dedication mentions James H. Schmitz, H. Beam Piper and Leigh Brackett and he threw in occasional references to their works - mention of Megair pirates, for example. All in all I'd say he does tell a decently entertaining story in their often pot-boilerish tradition."
2,Mediocre Space Opera,"I have to give the author credit for trying. This is a combination future history and Fred Saberhagen type ancient malignant forces in the universe story interlarded with Star Wars type mysticism. The future history, a time line is which a combined Japanese-Aztec society conquered the Earth and now runs an interstellar empire, is probably the most interesting component. It is presented obliquely as the background to the main action of the story and the reader has to exercise a bit of thought to infer the history of this society. The main story, the efforts of the characters to avoid awaking terrible cosmic forces from a prior age of the galaxy, is a descendent of Saberhagen's Berserkers and is a fairly routine action story. The elements of mysticism are simply silly and actually detract from the story."
4,Fascinating - and Powerful,"I do believe this is the first novel in 40 years of reading SF that I can recall as an alternate history Aztec space empire. Characterizations of Ms. Anderssen (the Russo-Swede xenoarcheologist)whose family remembers their conquest by the Azteca), Green Hummingbrid (Mexaca judge), the various aliens and the strong but ""low ranked"" Japanese warship officers and marines (sounding and acting like WWII warriors, albiet Azteca space navy). The story twists and turns from a bit of mental rebellion of the lower ""class"" europeans and aliens, the tough but subservient Japanese warriors and the ore ""pirates"" and their mining ship (that ""flies"" in a supporting but crucial role). Finally, a bit of a surprise ending, though one which says something about our own cultural/international clashes. If you like Turtledove, on some levels this neat novel is much more sophisticated - if not as action packed."
2,Loved it while it worked...,"I bought this mixer mostly for mixing bread doughs. My first model stripped its gears shortly after I received it, and Kitchen-Aid was quick to send a replacement. Now over a year later the same happened to my replacement model. Both times it happened while mixing bread dough on speed 2, which is the only speed allowed by the model for bread dough. I've used Kitchen-Aid models in commercial kitchens, so I thought the Kitchen-Aid Professional Series was what I wanted. Apparently I was wrong about the integrity of this company's products. I would have been a loyal customer, but I will not buy Kitchen Aid again."
1,Kitchenaid fails the test these days,"My wife bakes bread often and for years swore by the Kitchenaid mixer given her as a collective family present, which she passed on to her sister when we bought her a new ""heavy duty"" mixer. The new one failed within days and was replaced by the factory after way too many calls; the replacement failed after a couple years of average use and being essentially unable to complete any bread dough recipe as advertised. It's useless and disappointing, and sadly we have a lot of useless accessories with it too. We have heard no response from Kithenaid and will after years of loyalty and hundreds of dollars buy something else from perhaps Viking. Kitchenaid mixers are not what they were, and the Kitchenaid company is unresponsive to its customers. Don't waste your money!"
2,Poor fit,"I don't particularly like this bike light. It didn't fit on my bike frame, so I had to do some hacking to make it stay in place. Also, it uses uncommon awkward batteries instead of normal ones, so when the batteries go out then it will be a pain to replace them.It does what it says it does, though. Just make sure you have small enough tubes on your frame or else you'll be breaking out the duct tape."
4,Nice low cost blinky,"A good low cost blinky. Nothing really spectacular but not bad either. It's pretty bright considering it's size too. Although I think its's usually best to get the biggest one you can afford, for ten bucks this isn't a bad investment.I also use a planet bike headlight which I like alot:Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mountand the Down Low Glow for side visibility.Down Low Glow Lighting Kit - Two Tubes-Envy(green)"
2,nice small light but N battery sucks,I fail this unit due to it overpriced and non green N batterys which are not avable in recycable style
3,ok,"It'a a little bit small, and difficult to open to put the battery for the first time, but once it's done it works fine."
2,Missing -- With Good Reason,"Make no mistake; most of the tracks in Rhino's Missing Links series weren't good enough to be released in the first place. Listening to one of these discs is like fumbling around an ice chest full of Yoo-Hoo hoping to find a forgotten Pepsi. This volume is especially disappointing, since the gems here (All Of Your Toys, Nine Times Blue, and Carlisle Wheeling) can be heard as bonus tracks on other CDs. That leaves a lot of room for songs that sound like Davy is just making it up as he goes along (So Goes Love, Storybook Of You, and such). A few songs from the Kirschner era (Of You, Mike's turn at I Don't Think You Know Me) are worth a listen, but a few others from that era (Teeny Tiny Gnome, Apples, Peaches, Bananas, and Pears) are embarassing."
3,Odd Find,"""All The Kings Horses"" was about the only song on here I was familiar with, since that had been featured on their TV series. The rest of this consists of minor hits and rarities. Unless you really like this group, don't get it. Another wise, it's okay."
3,Once upon a once in a while...,"This is a collection of previously unreleased Monkees songs. Frankly, it's a mixed bag. There are some good songs here, alongside some not so good songs. ""I Don't Think You Know Me"", ""All of Your Toys"" and ""Nine Times Blue"" are great songs. Most of the songs here that Davy Jones wrote are bad songs. Then there are curiosities like ""Apples, Peaches, Bananas and Pears"", which is a decent song, but sounds a bit too much like ""Last Train to Clarksville"". ""My Share is of the Sidewalk"" is a strange Michael Nesmith song which is the only Nesmith song with a lead vocal by Davy Jones. And ""Teeny Tiny Gnome"" is ridiculous, but I find it amusing. Fans of the Monkees will dig this, although some of the songs later turned up as bonus tracks on the reissues of their old albums."
4,Surprising,"Quite a good effort for a 'rarities' type album. I would say this is worth the purchase on the strength of ""Of You"" alone, now one of my favorite Monkees tunes."
4,Fact or Fiction?,"I have not read Kihn's earlier works, but I will after reading Big Rock Beat! This story is as crazy as some of those recanted on his morning radio program. If I did not know better, I would say that Greg may have encountered some of these strange characters and escapades during his years as a rocker. Big Rock Beat is a quick paced and funny! Verboramo at its best - Great job Greg!"
4,Ed Wood + From Dusk Till Dawn + Back Beat = Big Rock Beat,"If you like the offbeat, goofy and bizarre, unpredictable story lines -- this is surely the book for you. It comes complete with beach bunnies, cars, drugs, and an up and coming band circa 1967. There are monsters too -- but it is hard to tell them apart from the movie moguls.This is Kihn's third novel, and each get's stranger but is good for a fast moving laugh with a few chills along the way. Recommended."
2,YUCK!,This CD is very disappointing. I have nothing against Angela Lansbury but I feel her voice doesn't fit the part of the character. If Auntie Mame drank and stayed up all night how come she could sing so well? I have to admit (even though alot of the people that have reviewed it hated it) that Lucille Ball's 1974 version of the play has a much better soundtrack (only available on LP that I know of). Lucy's voice fits the part of Mame much better that Angela's. If I were you I would go with another soundtrack and skip this one.
1,Decent,Angela Lansbury is not right for this part she dosen't have the right voice I think Lucille Balls version is better she has the voice to do Mame.I noticed alot of the review's bashed Lucille Ball about her vesion People should be more respectful of others opinions.I am amazed at how unrespectful some people are.I understand people have thier own opinion and I respect everyone's view !
4,"good seller - I'd still like to find a better copy of this book, though","good seller - but I'd still like to find a better copy of this book. The copy I received had a few underlines in it, which is annoying."
3,Quite thought-provoking.,"Quite different than reading the Bahir, Sefer Yetzirah and the like, but really gets you to thinking.I think ""thunderbug"" could have at least read the back cover and some of the inside before denouncing it, but considering that this person has negatively reviewed more than one of Leet's books, ya gotta wonder whether the consistently poor reviews aren't an agenda."
1,The Universal Kabbalah,"The use of the word Kabbalah in the title is very misleading,this is simply Not a book about Kabbalah.This is a book about the endless geometric permuatations of the triangle and the star of David.The author hardly bothers to speak about virtually any aspects of Kabbalah whatsoever and this is exceedingly annoying.Its about as exciting as reading the ingredients to a candy bar,and thats what your getting when you buy this book.It should be called Geometry meets candy coated kabbalah."
3,Expected more,The pictures are great. But some of the recipes are ones I have been making for a long time. Good for a beginner cook. Nothing new for an experienced cook...basic.
2,just recipes,"I certainly expected more from someone who is so demanding. This is just a book of recipes, and the short DVD offers precious few lessons on technique. One should expect to be booted from the kitchen if all they have to go on is the scant information in these recipes."
2,Disappointing and not terribly simple,"First I love Chef Ramsay and this is my first book by him, but overall it's a bit disappointing. For an american audience this is not -- I mean Pheasant? really? There's very little in here that I would consider making but maybe that's just me, but there are a few that I will definitely try.The design is very english and the photos are dreadful. Everything looks truly unappetizing and overprocessed. Not sure why so many glowing reviews on here but if you're on the fence I would check it out in a bookstore first.I would recommend the new MasterChef book from the TV Show. That was a delightful surprise.MasterChef Cookbook"
2,GordonRamsayMadesItEasy,"yes, he makes it easy and this book is priced fairly. BUT, good luck finding the ingredients in the stores that you need."
2,disappointing,"I was hoping for more form this master chef. I love his shows and was hoping for some insight into the award winning cuisine that he is know for and suggestions on techniques to improve my cooking ability. Instead, I found few dishes that were appealing. The ones that I did try were lack luster at best."
2,Dust off grasndma's old cook books,"Sorry to have to say this, but, not impressed. The price was over the edge & the DVD, well, come on; scrambled eggs? If grandma has no old cook books ( mine is long gone) check out garage sales. I found a gret set of 4 books in perfect conditiion from 1946 ( country Cook Book) for 4 bucks. I am now the most popular coopk in town."
5,Great book!,"If you like Gordon Ramsay (or even if you don't know who he is) but think his recipes are too hard for a normal household cook, this book is for you! He takes some really simple dishes and makes them look like something prepared in a 3 Michelin Star restaurant. He has pictures to show how the dishes should look for presentation purposes and he's very succinct and to the point. He also takes more elegant recipes and makes them so it's food that we can do at home. Well worth the purchase!!"
2,Off the wall,The recipes were not ones most people would eat and didn't give good pictures of the finished dish for every recipe. I will not make a single dish out of this book.
3,"Great Book, Weak Product Construction","Gordon Ramsay is authentic and a professional. Much like you at Amazon.Upon receipt of the eight copies of his book, the binding immediately separated upon opening three of them. Disappointed. Appears to be a glue thing which we are going to repair ourselves. FYI. Thank you. Janice"
5,Gordon Ramsay Is The Man,"Every time I mention that the fact that I admire ""Gordon Ramsay"" I have to defend myself from attack. For those who have seen this ex-football player in the television show ""Hell's Kitchen"", he can be intimidating, ruthlessly efficient and sarcastic all in one breath. But his attitude does not come from any joy of berating contestants. Gordon is a perfectionist and he wants to make sure everything is done right because it is his name and reputation that is on the line everytime a dish leaves his kitchen.This book is no different. Gordon spells out his recipies in a clear and concise format. Unlike some other chefs who use their books just to dump some bland exercises in cooking, Gordon livens up (or sexies up - as he calls it) his presentation with photos. But I especially appreciated the fact that there is a DVD attached to this book which goes into detail on how to make some of his dishes.GORDON RAMSAY IS THE MAN!!"
3,"Interesting looking recipes, but not ones I am likely to make","I haven't seen Gordon Ramsay's TV show, and I bought the book based on the description as ""simple, accessible recipes that take very little time to make"". The book is full of beautiful color photos, and for the right person this might become an often-used cookbook. There are a large number of seafood recipes. The recipes are generally high in saturated fat; many call for heavy cream or crème frache. A few of the recipes use ingredients that I am unlikely to prepare (e.g. baby octopus, calf's liver, mullet). After looking through the book, I decided that although it is a beautiful book, it isn't for me."
5,Wonderful,"Let me start by saying that I adore Mr. Ramsay. Anyone who excels and has that much passion for his ""calling"" is to be respected and admired. The cookbook couldnt be easier to follow. The DVD that is included is especially appreciated. I was reluctant to purchase this cookbook because I thought that someone of Mr. Ramsays stature -his recipes would be very difficult. Quite the contrary. 5 starts from me !!!"
4,straightforward and pretty easy to use,"Ramsay's book features a variety of recipes ranging from simple breakfasts to pretty elaborate dinner fare. For the most part, they are dishes featuring readily available ingredients and not requiring a world of preparation.The biggest gripe I have is that the included DVD is so short - it features only a handful of dishes from the book, and watching Ramsay cook them not only shows you how it's done, but gives you a nice glance at his personality (something you can also gain a little input on based on the writing in the book, which tries not to be dull where possible)."
5,Great Recipes,I ordered the book for my husband. He loves it. He has made several wonderful dinners from the recipes. Thanks Gordon Ramsay
4,Yummy!,Great recipes covering various types and styles of cooking. Also covers a lot of different tastes and time constraints. Good first Ramsay cookbook since it broadens the spectrum of his dishes and is also very personal.
4,True to the title,"I received this cookbook as not only do I love to cook, but I LOVE Gordon Ramsey. He has a flair to make the dullest things not so dull and some very original but simple recipes. I like that this did stay true to the title of the book. The pictures are full of color and some of him and his kids that bring a softer touch to this cookbook and him. If you want something a little different but still in the ""norm"" I highly recommend this cookbook. I love it."
3,not what i thought,i was hoping for a book with more comforting foods. but its ok for what is in it and the money.
5,Great Gift,"My husband loves to watch Gordon Ramsey shows and enjoys cooking. This cookbook is easy to follow, with great food, and comes with a dvd. It is the perfect gift."
4,"Nice recipes, but maybe too complicated for an 'easy' book.","I love watching his BBC show, so I was excited to get one of his books. He always makes cooking look so easy, but these recipes are a little complicated. I was hoping for more basic recipes, but a lot of them are more appropriate for dinner parties and entertaining, not a basic dinner meal. There are a few I will use, but most of these recipes will probably go unused. Some of the basic kitchen lessons, pantry list sections are useful, I'll probably use this book the most for that."
4,"Very good recording, but not my favorite.",For the best Pierrot Lunaire go right to the Piere Boulez/Christine Schafer on Deutsche Grammophon. It also features the wonderful Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte.
3,Beware of Church Reference,"This book, like most PK Hallinan books, is really sweet but I was disappointed to find the church part of the rhyme and the God and heaven reference. This was not mentioned in any description of the book that I read prior to ordering it. As a Jewish mother I can't read to my daughter that ""We like to dress up on Sundays to go to church""...that would be a bit confusing."
2,Christian and Pre-Ks only...,"Few FYIs:This book says 2+, but it quickly maxes out at 3/4 (very simplistic, and single layered).It's overtly Christian, not just religious, but mentions ""church"" on Sundays.It's also very Caucasian, no other families are pictured inside than the one on the cover.A MUCH better-written, and more universal book isI Love My Mommy Because...for the added bonus of educating about animals as well as the things moms do for their kids. Both of these my son (almost 4 now) asks for again and again, since he was 18mths and could only sign ""More!"" :-)"
1,This is not DVD-Audio,This is another format and does not play on DVD-Audio equipment. Warning. This disc did not work in my machine and after furthur review I noted that the disc itself is not DVD-Audio despite the header. Its another format and a huge waste of money.
1,Surgically cleansed Monk,"I think the reviewer that said, ""I don't even like jazz and I like this album"" says it all. Here we have yet further evidence of Marsalis trying to cleans jazz of all its communicative African roots in blues.If all you hear in jazz is good tone and swing, then buy up the Marsalis catalogue and call it a day. But if you want to hear ""real"" jazz...then look elsewhere. If you are looking for a Monk tribute disc (because you own everything in the Monk catalogue and STILL can't get enough), I would suggest either Steve Lacy (he has released many recordings covering Monk) or the 3 disc set with Alexander von SchlippenbachMonk's Casino: The Complete Works of Thelonious Monk.This disc is like a ""Kenny G plays Monk"" tribute."
2,Candlesticks not well-suited for tapers,"Although I like the look of the bronze candelsticks, I was quite disappointed when I tried to fit tapers into the candlesticks. The openings on the holders are too wide! In order to successfully use the candelsticks, I wedged a small papertowel strip in-between the taper and the candlestick opening. Only then was I able to use the candlesticks with tapers.Perhaps mine are just defective, but I honestly don't think so. Surely, if the product was defective, then one of the candlesticks would have been the appropriate size for the tapers."
2,Pretty Pictures,"I was confused as to who authored this book, as Sarah Bradley's name never appears in my 2002 edition which also has a different car on the front cover than pictured here. The book does have many beautiful and stunning pictures of great muscle cars. Most of the pricing, production figures and engine configurations are very interesting. The only problem with the book was that it was never proofed for errors after printing. Many of the picture inset desriptions are referencing the wrong picture and sometimes even on the wrong page. Some of the descriptions are in error as to the year of the vehicle (eg. a 1967 Chevelle description of a 1968 Chevelle). One of the pictures is even inversed making the Satellite look like a right-hand drive car with funny license plates. It is a shame that such a fine book was never proofed checks for such obvious errors, but, still a fine book for muscle car lovers."
2,"Good pics, few information","A good book to see the most important muscle cars, and just that. Few information, several pics of cars with aftermarket wheels and tires, some errors (e.g., ""the 1964 GTO goes 0-60 in 14 seconds""). I don't recommend it. If I could see the book before, I wouldn't buy it."
4,Witty and Funny,"Found and read this book over the holidays at Grandparents' house because of lack of other reading materials. Wonderful find! It was an extremely funny, although sometimes ghoulish, book. From the Henkers to Babs, all of the characters are well developed and come alive in some of the most creative prose that I have read. I would highly recommend Alp for someone looking for a short and funny change from your typical boring fictional novel."
5,Case works great.,"This case is great. I figured I wouldn't be getting a bigger lens for a while and this would work perfect. I love how it works with the camera's own strap. It's really easy to slip the camera in and out and obviously the camera is more protected than when I was carrying it with no case at all. The case is soft, but has structure and I really like that. I was very happy with this purchase."
2,Soft bag falls short of expectations,"While certainly doing the job of protecting your Nikon DSLR from dust and minor injuries, this bag does not prove useful when carrying the camera. To access it, you have to complete disentangle the bag, and this operation (while easy to do) leaves you with 2 objects in hand: the camera and the large bag that you must carry without any strap. Inconvenient."
2,Rating of a Nikon CF-DCI camera case.,This case fit the camera OK but disappointed me as to the quality of workmanship for the price paid. My main complaint is that it only had velcro closure for the case instead of a metal clasp. There was no way of carrying it (no strap or handle) except for openings to use the strap on the camera.
1,Wish I'd read the reviews before purchase,"I was amazed that I got taken this bad. This is the first bad on-line purchase experience I have ever had. The case in the picture is literally all you get. No strap, no pockets & thin padding. I supposed it is my fault for not paying attention to what I was buying - but in this case I still don't believe I got what I paid for - I got even less."
5,Great,I love Nikon authentic products! Great quality! I would buy this again. It is great to protect my camera while in my purse.
4,Great!!,this was a good buy. i was satisfied with what i bought and will definetly look into buying more from this place
1,Must Remove Camera to Use,"This case, unlike the good Nikon SLR cases of a few years ago, does not allow the user to take pictures by just unsnapping the top of the case at the rear top, and dropping it off the top and front of the camera so that it would hang down under the body of the camera while leaving the camera attached by a screw. You must completely remove the camera from the case to use the camera, which in my opinion, is totally worthless. Apparently its sole purpose is to keep dirt off the camera, which any bag will do."
1,"Twice the price, half the value","I thought: hey, a Nikon case for my Nikon sounds like a good idea. Not really. This this NOT something you want to buy:- VERY limited shock protection- no way to carry it outside of using the camera's own strap- then it hangs from the strap when shooting- no handle, no belt loops- no pockets for extra batteries, memory cards...Bottom line: a waste of money to me. I bought a 20$ bag at a local kits camera with all of the above and I'm a happy camper now: shockproof, pockets, strap, belt loop, handle and even to side loops to hang additional piggy back bags if I ever decide to buy another lense."
3,Great Traveling Case,"This case works well as a traveling case to protect it when not in use. If you are planning on taking it off and on alot while shooting, it's probably not the product for you."
3,Purchased for my Nikon D3100,"I recently purchased this case to go with my Nikon D3100.. While it fits the 3100 nicely with the standard lens, it falls a little sort with the 55-200 lens and doesnt fit the 18-105 lens at all.. I think they could have done better with the neck sizing with this case, but for what it was designed for I like it."
5,Another hard ass darkroom CD,This is some crazy hard rap. I'm a huge darkroom fan and this cd lives up to some of the classics like From The Barrio With Love and Penitentiary Chances. Get this right away!
1,Junkfood,"Just bought one on 3/5/2012....!delivered at 3/7/2012 11:00 AMTrowed away at 11:02 AMMy god..., never buy this.The hinges are broken wile unpackingdont buy this stuff..!!!Georges,Belgium"
1,Pyle is a perfect brand name for this POS,"Pros: It's cheapCons: It's cheap!, no wire for +ignition wire which is used on almost all stereos. If you want/need to connect that wire for your radio to work you'll be drilling a hole in the case. Ears on the mounting bracket broke the first wave I hit with a 18 fish and ski. Both snapped right at the bends. Case is showing a stress fracture where the face plate screws in.If you are going to buy this plan on spending ~$10 on some aluminum bar stock and make yourself a respectable bracket."
2,Good price but !,"The first reviewer got it right, but he was too kind. I can not recommend this product, and I am trying to get a refund.The flip up door hinge is nothing but plastic and it can, and did break, on me right off the bat.The shell of the unit is ok, just the flip up door lacks approval, and needs improvement."
1,poorly made- broke from normal use,"As others have metnioned, this is a piece of junk. The cover fell of in my hand soon after install. the plastic pins the hold the cover on the enclosure are of minimal size and thickness. Truly a poor design!"
1,Hinge Broke,Eventually the product did what I wanted...mount on my cruizer motorocycle behind my faring...looks good. Problem though the hinge tab broke after a couple of use snapping it open and closing. I ended up shaving off the other end and some other modification in order to install two mini-hinges.
2,Bad design,The product is nice but the design is poor due to receiving the door henge being broke when I received it.
2,Pyle stero housing,"This is an attractive looking housing but poorly designed and somewhat lacking in quality control. The color code for the wiring of the housing and the pyle radio are almost entirely different which seems bizarre,the threaded in plastic fasteners are poorly done and the antennae connection even worse. If and when I get the radio to work I will keep it as I made the housing work ok but would not recommend that anyone buy it.PYLE PLMRCW3 White Water Resistant Stereo Housing with Full Chassis Wired Casing"
2,Disappointed!,This item was bought to protect stereo from the elements. Disappointed with the durability. Cover leaked dust and rain. Now it completely broke off.
1,Face cover broken,"Weather proof yes, long lasting absolutely not.The cover broke off the hinge housing after 1 weekend of opening and closing 4 times."
1,Not worthy of the PYLE brand name.,"As EVERYone has already mentioned; the flip-up cover's hinge pins break-off immediately. The wiring color-codes are nonsense! You MUST re-wire the speaker- and power-leads or you're asking for trouble. The brass inserts, on the sides, break loose as you tighten the cheezy Knob-Screws. Only a tiny dab of some brittle cement was applied at the factory. The M6 threads in these brass inserts were not tapped properly, so the Knob-Screw shafts bind/sieze almost immediately. These are ""blind"" holes that will require re-tapping and, preferably, use of a bottoming-tap before becoming useful.OVERALL: It's a great concept and a handsome design. Despite all the shortcomings this worked well for my custom head-unit installation, where water-proofing is not a concern, but I would NEVER recommend this for any outdoor/marine application. PYLE AUDIO SHOULD BE ASHAMED for branding such JUNK with their well-respected name."
2,sorta crappy,"The wiring harness that ran through the shell used too small guauge wiring. The door closed well enough, but stuck most times when trying to open it, and after about 30 uses, broke off, pretty much killing the entire reason for having it."
3,40 years and it still great,"Bought this in blu-ray, but the picture hasn't been upgraded, so it looks good it's not really high- def. should've bought it in standard DVD."
3,Lets make it cheaper,I wish everyone would stop giving this movie such a high review so I can buy it for a dollar
3,Hilarious but...3 stars for format,"No need to review the film which is a comedy gem...just the format:The film starts in widescreen, unusual for a video tape. And just when you're getting used to it, the opening credits end and it reverts back to fullscreen(!)To add insult to injury, the end credits are not even included, the movie simply ends! So much for finding out who the actors were.......C'mon Paramount...how about the full version on DVD?"
2,who's minding the store,"Jerry Lewis I love you!! all the funniness you would expect from a Jerry Lewis movie, he is just a nut!!! a great addition to my Jerry collection!!"
5,Who's Minding the Store,My husband is a huge Jerry Lewis fan and this is one of the movies he did not have. He was delighted toreceive it for Christmas.
4,"very good movie, but over priced","i have not seen all of jerry lewis's movies but i'm guessing this has to be one of his best. i'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 though for these reasons: 19 dollar dvd, no captioning, no bonus material, and their's a strange pause at 58:50 (their are no scratches or scuffs on dvd). so an over-priced basic dvd of a very funny movie."
4,WHO'S MINING the STORE ?,"IF, I DIDN'T LIKE or ENJOY THIS DVD. I WOUNTN'T HAVE BOUGHT IT. I ENJOY MOST OF JERRY LEWIS MOVIES. HE'S SO FUNNY. KEN"
4,A true shoppers experiance!!,"I first remember seeing this when I was young. The best part is the ""SALE""!! One early morning my daugther (she was about 18 yrs. old} and I wanted to go to ""the morning after christmas"" sale. We got up early and were the first two people at the door of this one store in the mall. We had our eye on somethings we really wanted to get at half price. People started adding up quick, behind us. I told my daugther, as soon as this door opens run as fast as you can.She had seen the movie, at some point, also. As soon as the doors open we ran! We started remembering this mad part of Jerry's movie and got to laughing so hard we almost didn't make it. I'll always love this movie, as well will my daugther. My adult son loves good clean comedy, so I bought this for him for his birthday."
5,Something looks familar...,"Something looks family...I'm not quite sure what it is, but maybe it's the pretty girl(s).I thoroughly enjoy good clean humor. It's been quite some time since I've seen a humorous movie not containing explicit material."
3,is there any other music by DAS FURLINES?,track #7 by the female group DAS FURLINES is... very good. incredibly hilarious.fun. rockin polka. i discovered DAS FURLINES on this record and have been searching for other music by them ever since.
3,Good example of the Yardbirds... but not the best,"The first Yardbirds CD I bought was The BBC Sessions which I thought was incredible. So I went out to buy another CD knowing that the versions would be a little different so I bought this one... I was a little dissapointed because The BBC sessions, I thought, were so good. But that doesn't mean that I don't like this CD. It's the Yardbirds and it's great so if you've never heard them before and you want to get a feel for the music... this is a great CD for you."
3,Yardbirds greatest hits 1964-66,This band is always considered by me as the break-through band to modern rock and roll and was obviusly the beginings of a lot of singers still going solo and strong today
3,Yardbirds 1964-1966,"If you like Yardbirds you will like this. There are better yardbirdsCD's, but this ain't bad."
3,Preparing for later Greatness,"OK, a lot of amazing musicians spent time in this outfit, but is that enough to qualify the Yardbirds as great? Not for me. Some of the songs are OK, mostly the one's we've all heard; otherwise, this is the Monkees messin' with the blues. Hardly essential. I borrowed this and didn't bother downloading it. Wanted to know what they were about, but not something I will revisit. I finally get why all the great guitarists just passed through the band: they wanted more than becoming the next Herman's Hermits."
3,Its Okay,"the yardbirds are okay but nothin special if you ask me. okay so ya they got a few good songs like, for your love, train kept a rollin, im a man, etc. but they just sing about love and relationships thats itdont waste 12 bucks on this"
4,"Great trap, but needs to be plugged in...",Works as promised. User needs to remember that these things won't magically solve your mosquito problem overnight. If you are planning on just turning it on during a barbeque you will be disappointed. Works best by turning it on at the beginning of the mosquito season and let it run for as long as you can during the spring summer. One propane tank lasts over 3 weeks. Wish I had known it needed to be plugged in. Not a show stopper but is limiting for users that don't have electricity where they need this.
2,"Good mosquito attracter, bad mosquito killer","If you have the invasive tiger mosquitos, this device will attract them but fail to kill them. These mosquitos are strong fliers and simply fly away from the meger suction provided by this device."
2,not enough protection,We bought 2 of these to cover our rather large yard. Granted mosquito season was well under way BUT we didn't notice much of a change-even right next to the machine. WE gave it 2 months and found very few dead ones in the trap. I wish I could return it but I'm afraid too much time has passed.
4,Excellent book. A must-read for police and police trainers.,"This book provides information that is almost timesless, in that the circumstances in which police officers are slain has remained constant over many years. However, few publications have examined the circumstances in which officers have been slain as closely as this one has. I've been a police trainer for 15 years, and this publication has been a often-quoted source of mine. It has caused many police trainers to re-assess their training priorities. I highly recommend this publication."
3,Everybody just SLOOOW down,"Yes, this is a worthwhile read and a good addition to the growing paranomal-vampire genre. But there are some serious holes in this novel. The length of the book, on reflection, shows I think the author's attempt to bring some method to her lead character's madness but it never totally works. The lead female character is so wan and insubstantial--yes, she has a terminal illness I know--that I can't see the attraction. Her male lead is vibrant,good looking and she has...a nice voice?Put this farther down your reading stack or wait for a used book."
2,Not as listed,"I was not very happy when I recieved this book, was listed as brand new and I paid full price for this item. Only to find that it had a HUGE crease across teh front cover, and the binding was dented and had small rips. If I would have bought this book used I would have understood this kind of wear. Very disappointed in this purchase."
2,Disillusioned,"I was so excited to read this book because I had heard some good reviews. It was interesting at first, but after the descriptions of the guys in the Brotherhood, it just seemed like a cheap version of the Dark-Hunters. I love Sherrylin Kenyon's books so this series made me a little mad because Ward's characters, especially Zsadist who reminded me of Zarek, were just like Kenyon's characters. Even her website was like a rip-off. If you want to read some good books, check out the Dark-Hunter series."
4,Sets up the next book perfectly,"J.R Ward has an amazing way of setting up the next book.At the end of the first I was dying to know more about Rhage (whose story this book primarily featured) and now I am dying to know more about Zsadist (who is featured in the next).The only bizarre part about this book was that Beth and Wrath (who featured in the first) were barely in it. And I still can't get into the Mr X, Mr O plot line. But its nice to get to know each member of the Brotherhood.*runs off to read the third book*"
4,Blonde vampire hotness,"This was a fantastic book. It was the classic gorgeous man goes after the ordinary female fantasy. I have read the whole series thus far, and Ward always manages to engross me completely in every aspect."
3,Exciting reading,Like book 1 book 2 was exciting fun reading for me. I am really liking all the characters and story line is also great. I am very excited to read book 3 :)
4,reread,Lover Eternal has Rhage falling in love with a sick mortal named Mary. The playboy accidently puts her life in danger with the lessers. Mary's neighbor Bella who is a vampire catchs Zsadists eye even though he is not one that gets along with females. Bella also gets captured by the lessers. Another great read that I didn't want to put down.
5,Onward and Upward,"The series has been great so far. I finally finished the second book and it was even better than the last. To any mature audience, this book would be great. Onward and upward for the series."
3,Love the book but skip the 'Lesser' sections,"I have several of the Black Dagger Brotherhood books on my 'keeper' shelf, and have reread each of them multiple times. But I have to state that I now completely SKIP OVER (or, at most, skim) the sections about the 'Lessers'. I can still follow the plot and love the tortured uber-male Brotherhood heroes and the romance story lines. BUT I find the violence and horror of the Lessers too disturbing to read. I actually find Laura K Hamilton less disturbing!"
4,Good but ....,"First, I like the alt. world JR Ward has created. The characters are interesting and have a lot of potential for future stories. I'm not going to get into the plot, etc.My beef with Ward is the unnecessarily silly spellings for the silly names for her characters. For an author with such obvious creativity, couldn't she come up with some better names than Rhage or Vishous? Every time I have to read one of those names, she loses me.Also, some of her prose, especially dialogue between the male characters or internal male musing, is too contrived and just doesn't sound convincing. Some of it comes off as if she were preparing for the movie version of the book.Having said all that, I am looking forward to the next book."
5,This book is so good,"Everyone is raving about these books and the praise is well worth it. This writer is excellent, the book is smokin' and she (JR Ward) deserves all the success in the world, can't wait for the next book!"
2,Not enough depth,"As someone who has already read Sherilyn Kenyon, Lynsay Sands and Christine Feehan books about vampires I find this version not very well written. Each of the authors above created a world that was highly complex but explained it fully to the point that you enjoyed each turn and twist from real life. J. R. Wards style has too many types of species and events that are not explained, characters that are so negative and not fully developed which make it very hard to stay focused and enjoy the experience of this series. I have read 5 books out of this series and still don't feel like I know enough about this world to really look forward to another book, like I do for the authors listed above. Also it seems that the drama of each character is drawn out to the point where I just want to know the end rather than how the story plays out.Mfiona"
3,"Okay, I read another one of these things...","Number 2 book in the series - Sheesh...the dialogue is perfectly ridiculous, these guys ""bond"" with their female mates in warp speed, which means not much character development. I find myself skimming over awkward conversations, yet another scene involving a throbbing***,very gorey fight scenes with their enemies the ""lessors"" - however, I will probably be reading #3 to see how Zsadist redeems himself and to validate what I already suspect - Phury is actually the disturbed, wacko twin - he doesn't really want Zsadist to be happy...because then he'll have no excuse for sticking his multi-hued head into his brother's business. The author is on to something - I am reading them even though they are dumb. Keep it coming!"
2,Slow and Kind of Boring,"I had a hard time finishing this book. I am dissapointed b/c I love the 1st book in the series. The hero is angry and a little to weak (emotionally) for my taste. The heroine is the worst. She is too emotional and sappy. Granted she did have cancer, but her character really had no back bone. Just not a good read overall. Yes, the sex scene was good, but other than that, nothing. I mean how can you get into the sex scenes when the heroine is skinny and all weak from the cancer????"
2,NOT MY KINDA BOOK AT ALL,"I read the review of D.Silva and agreed with everything she wrote. This could,ve been a good book but when the hero sleeps with someone else that's the point where I hated it. IF I wanted real life I can watch a documentary. I wish I had seen my review before I bought the book, cause then I wouldn't have wasted my money.When I read the first book by J R Ward, I thought this is okay the kind of book I like, but I don't think I'll buy anymore"
1,Cheating hero and weak doormat herione,Don't want to waste your time with long details why this book is not worth your money.Cheating hero + weak doormat heroine = spineless heroine.
4,Great series,"I haven't disliked one of the books in the whole Black Dagger Brotherhood. The focus on the different characters per book is great, good adult materials, graphic, and an enjoyable read overall."
5,Wonderful,So excited after I read the first book in this series and realized I had many more books in this fantastic series to read!
4,Enjoyed it,It was pretty entertaining...but I hate the story on the lessers! Have a feeling all the books are gonna be the same!
4,I cried.,"I cried a few times while reading this, because the characters were written well enough for me to have sympathy for them. I wasn't a fan of the end so much, but it wasn't horrible or completely divergent from the main story."
5,the B E S T in the series. Simply amazing!,"I LOVE this book so much. In my eyes is simply perfect. It has humor, HOT sexual tension, action, steamy sex scenes, romance, and it even made me cry (that doesnt happen often for me!). I really enjoyed the dynamics of this couple, Rhage and Mary are perfect together. Rhage is definitely my favorite vamp along with Zsadist. I cannot recommend this one enough!"
2,Boring,Rhage is such a sexy character to read about but Mary is so boring I can't bring myself to finish the book. I personally don't want to read about a boring unattractive female who's dying of cancer. Vampire romance or trashy novels are supposed to be about sex appeal and imagination lol a fantasy. I don't want to be depressed and bored while reading this kind of book. I want to read about a more exciting attractive female so I can live vicariously through them while reading the book and imagine I'm that hot gorgeous female. I had cancer been there done that. If I'm going to indulge in a trashy novel I sure don't want to think about cancer. Rhages character deserved way better than a boring plain Jane.
5,Best Series I have found yet!!!,I stumbled upon this series by accident! I was just browsing looking for a book to read while my kids were with their father for Christmas and found this series I purchased the first book and with in hours bought the second book! This is a super fast and fun read! The characters are very believable even though they are vampires and the sex scenes just get better with every book! Spoiler: Book three is by far the steamiest book I have read so far!!Once you start you wont be able to put any of the books down!!
1,I did not like this at all,"I really did not like this book. I liked the first one in the series ok - it wasn't great but I read it to the end. I didn't read this book even halfway through. Really - vanilla ice cream helps the burn when Rhage is exposed to the sun? Seriously? And the whole I went out and had sex last night with complete strangers but I'll never do it again thing. NO. And why do the brothers talk like they do? It is just wrong - written wrong. This book is flawed. The idea behind the series has potential but it just has to be better plotted than this. The author came up with the idea of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, but she can't come up with anything better than vanilla ice cream on a vampire's burns? NO."
5,Hooked on J.R. Ward,I love J.R. Ward and her gritty romances. This is my second favorite in the series.
5,Awesome,This is a great book! I will definitely recommend it to all my friends who love the paranormal romance. I couldn't put it down...I just had to find out what happened next!!
4,Nice,"Kind of quirky but good. Although corny in some spots, it keeps it going. Excellent beach read. Worth it to keep going through the whole series."
5,What to say? Rage and Mary....,"Her best book, deep, well developed characters that you end up cheering for......a joy to read (except for the weepy parts, only one or two really) but a re reader for sure."
4,so very good,"After reading the first book in this series , i couldnt stop myself from reading the rest of the series."
5,Great second book,"Just as great as the first book. I hate the dialogue though! 'You feel me?'I thought Rhage would have a much better back story than he did...oh well. Very ebtertaining. I'm obsessed at this point. Once again, the leading female was forgettable while the guys just jumped to life. I'm busting at the seams to read Zsadist's part next."
5,Awesome Book,This was a great book JR Ward is an top writer in my book. The story line is great and alot different from most vampire novels.
5,"More Brothers, Pleaseee!!!","Although I love this series I have mix emotions about this book. The Brothers are peferct as always. I gave the book 5 stars because of Rhage, he deserves them all, but I just can't stand Mary. There's nothing special about her,and she gets Rhage??? Pleeease, the whole vampire thing is more believable than Ugly Betty getting Brad Pitt, and at least Betty is funny, but Mary...she's just B O R I N G! I still can't believe he falls for her. Sure is great to see the underdog win but the underdog has to be some likeable, that you can relate to, but Mary...(sights)"
4,Return to the Brotherhood,"I just recently stumbled across J.R. Ward's vampire reading and enjoyed the first book a great deal. Ward burns hotter than Laurell K. Hamilton so if you shy away from blatant sex this book isn't for you. This is the story of Rhage, yet another tall, good looking vampire who's falling for a human. Ward has a real talent for making the steam roll off the pages, her only downfall possibly would be the constant slang used between the characters--'you feel me' made ME feel my age, but possibly she's reaching for a younger audience. Still, this is a great soon-to-be trilogy and if you like your vamps hot and can deal with a little violence, you'll like this one."
2,"I really wanted to love this book, but...","I just couldn't get over how these ""Vampires"" talked. I'd read a little and then something would come out of their mouth's that just didn't sit right. They sounded like a bunch of frat boys, and let me tell you I don't get excited reading about boys...I want Men.If you need an example here's some of their words... ""Gitcha, what up, gotta, whadda, hollywood, my brother, (and a personal *favorite*...) Hal E. Wood!!!.And what's with Mr. O and Mr. E? Not very cool. Seriously, I'm starting to develop twitches.And, before many of you readers start arguing that I'm probably a fifty something woman who doesn't understand the change in the language since 'my day'...I'm 24.But, the sad part is I'm so lonely for a great vampire book that I probably will succumb to Lover Eternal and just read the hell out of it. Not out of love, but pure desperation.Oh, one last thing, who the hell wears wife-beaters? *twitch, twitch*Thanks."
4,Lover Eternal (Black Dagger Brotherhood) book 2,"This is the second in the series of a long line of Black Dagger Brotherhood novels.This is Rhage's story, and what a guy he is. He has been cursed by The Scribe Virgin, he has a raging beast inside him who is looking every chance to be unleashed. He is the lover of the warriors, a real ladies man.Mary has had a hard life, through illness and has given up on love a long time ago. Her friend and neighbour Bella introduces her to a world she never imagined existed. She cannot believe Rhage is actually interested in her. She feels that sometimes something else is looking out through his eyes.Rhage knows he needs to claim Mary for his own. His beast also recognises Mary as it's mate, and she is the only one that can soothe Rhage after a transformation.The ending is perfect, a real tear jerker. My heart really broke for Rhage. The characters have developed well from Dark Lover, and I am eager to read the next instalment 'Lover Awakened,' Zsadist's story."
5,Excellent 2nd volume of the series,"I just bought this book and read it in one sitting, I couldn't put it down, the storyline is heart wrenching. J.R. Ward continues the story of the Black Dagger Brotherhood beautifully in this installment. You get more background on the other members of the Brotherhood and learn why Rhage was cursed with the dragon. Can't wait for the next novel about Z."
3,Okay supernatural romance,Okay but not the best series. Worth a read though if you eat books like I do and like the supernatural genre.
5,Great Book,"I loved this book, and of course the series. I read it out of order so it made it all the more interesting. There is not much I can add that have not already been said, but this is a wonderful series, action, humor and hot HOT scenes. You wont regret it."
4,Rhage and Mary,"Rhage is a gorgeous, vampire warrior with a nasty dark side. Mary is a human who has battled with her own dark issues. I love that Rhage holds Mary above everything else; she is the only thing that can tame the beast inside of him. This book keeps you on the edge, hoping for a HEA. I am currently reading the most recent book in the series, Lover Avenged, but Rhage is still my favorite brother. The subplots in this book were also good."
5,So good.,I didn't want this book to end. I especially loved Rhage's character although I thought Mary put up too much of a fight sometimes. I'm so glad there are more books in this series. I can't believe I waited so long to start reading the Black Dagger Brotherhood series!
3,What do you want from this book?,"In reading the second of the brotherhood series, I found myself craving some sort of development in Ward's world. Who are these godlike beings that seem to enjoy throwing their underlings at each other? Why is all of this happening? Do we really need a separate book detailing how each of the brothers finds love? Personally, I was hoping to hear some more about Beth."
3,Hmmm still okay,Book two is all about Rhage and his lady Mary. He has his on inner war going while fighting lessers and trying to win over the love of his life. I cannot stand that scribe virgin. Someone should give her a taste of her own medicine. Overall the book was nice. I was expecting it to end a little different but it ended okay. Zsadist comes more into view in this book as well. His character starts opening up a little more giving us a quick peek. The only way to find out more is to read the next one so i guess that's where I'm off to.
3,Ok... Not great,This book was not as good as the first one but was a still a good read. Hopefully the next ones are better!
5,Tear-jecker,"This book was AWESOME. I loved Rhage and Mary. Ward furthers the story and characters beautifully. Not a disappointment by a loooong shot.Have plenty of tissues at hand though. Their story was very moving. I can't wait for the next Brother, Zsadist and his woman, Bella."
3,"Meh, it's just not that good","After this book I'm not sure that I am going to bother reading the rest of the series. To start, I can't stand the brothers names, they just really grate on my nerves Surely she could have some up with something a little bit more imaginative? I also cannot stand the way the brothers talk. Sometimes it is so awkward it is almost like the book was translated from a foreign language. What is with calling women females all the time? Annoying!I had a problem with the beast sex stuff too. I am no prude but just did not enjoy the level of raunchiness involved. I guess I am the type of reader that doesn't need every little detail of sex described to me and I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes. I gave up romances in high school after I started getting the real thing haha. I like a little more substance to my books nowadays."
5,Even better than Dark Lover!,"I really loved this book. After reading Dark Lover, I was still a little skeptical, but now I am hooked. The names of the warriors are a little silly, but who cares. The characters are over-the-top, but in a supernatural romance, that is expected. I really love getting to know all the brothers as each new book unfolds. She does an excellent job of giving Rhage his own story, while still allowing the other characters personalities to develop. Her heroine is spunky and the challenges she faces makes the story that much richer. I could barely put this book down. I am a huge fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon and it is so nice to find a new author. I can't wait for the next one!!"
5,Black Dagger Brotherhood,All of Ward's books are a must have in my Library. I can hardly wait for her next book to release!
4,"LOVE THE ""BROTHERHOOD""","I love the BROTHERHOOD VAMPIRE books. they have great story lines and they continue off each other, so the charterers are familiar. Vampires, suspense & sex . What more can a girl want."
3,Not as good as Dark Lover,"I loved the first book in this series and am now up to book 6. So far this story was my least favourite. I didn't care for Mary at all and found a number of things in the book too unbelievable. Mary was supposed to be ill yet she was so 'strong' and unafraid of the beast.In saying that it is a must read to fully appreciate book 3 which is fantastic.Lover Awakened (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 3)"
4,Great Reading,"I was givin the first book by a very dear friend often we exchange books when we see each other from time to time. Little did I know it was going to throw me into a frenzy, I read the first book and seemed I just could'nt get enough, the more I read the more excited I got this series is the most captivating and just all around good reading I've read in a long time! It keep me on the edge of my seat!!! I wish I had discovered them soorner. I would love to read how it all got started,how they lived before their lives were turned upside down,and how it really all got started!"
5,The brotherhood stole my heart!,"This follow up to Dark Lover pulls you deeper into the world of the Black Dagger Brotherhood with no desire to leave. Rhage is a character that is more than he seems. Mary Luce is a character you can't help rooting for. The brothers are dark, dangerous and delicious. The book has you turning pages from the start to the finish. It is hot and steamy but doesn't sacrifice plot at any point. When you are done you can't wait to read. Lover Awakened, the next book in the series."
5,BEST NEW SERIES,"Like the first book of the series, book two continues the on the story on the world of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. This time we concentrate on the character of Rhage and his leading lady Mary.Like in my previous reviews these books are beyond words. And you WILL be hooked.This is a must read and the series overall is absolutly fantastic."
2,Venus on Vacation,"In the previous Venus Diamond novels we have seen her as a get-tough, get-it-done Fish and Wildlife Agent. Since her marriage to Richard, Venus appears to have lost her way. She is depressed, goal-less, and unable to carry out her investigation of murder and theft in her usual no nonsense, efficient style. She is unable to dodge the bad guys, getting hit over the head more than once. Unfortunately, little sense is knocked into her. Venus needs to get her life back and with the Zen help of Dr. Wong might do so if she can muster up the motivation. Venus does get to realize one of her dreams, that of becoming an astronaut, but this part of the plot is decidedly far fetched.As an avid reader of mysteries, and as a great lover of the out-of-doors, I would like to see Venus return to her roots and her kicking ways. This is not the Venus I have come to know and love."
5,One of the Best Books on the subject matter,One of the best books on Reliability Data analysis with an excellent set of examples and clear writing style.
1,Not MY Cup Of Tea,"This may be a good novel of the thriller genre; I never finished it. Why? Because of the author's cold calculation that his opening of the book - consisting of a masturbatory scene - would intrigue and tittilate the reader. Maybe if one is wrting to make a buck, this kind of thing is understandable. But that will never make it right. There are other Les Standiford novels on the bookshelves. I won't read those either."
5,The best gun/multipurpose oil period,"I must admit, I had mixed feelings at first since I was a RemOil and CLP guy, but after talking to a friend, I thought that I would pick this up. I am glad I did! This stuff is the best oil/CLP I have ever tried! I was a little leery about red tint, but it wipes clean! I use this stuff on my weapons and other metallic surfaces. I was surprised at how well it shines chrome and steel! Very nice product! Remember, a little bit goes a long way!"
4,Top notch item made with superior materials!,"After breaking the cheap plastic lens in my old (fluorescent) under cabinet fixture, a quick trip to my local ""Big Box Builder's Barn"" yielded nothing but the same junky replacement options.Glad I took the time to look here! The American Lighting fixture I purchased and installed is 10x more aesthetically pleasing and much better suited for our kitchen workspace. The three 35 watt halogens mean no annoying hum or delay/flutter when turned on and the low/high light switch function is an added bonus. The lens on this one is glass which means it won't yellow and bust like it's crap-tastic predecessor.My only criticism is that this item was not packaged very well. Thankfully, there were no overly fragile bulbs to worry about."
2,Carve Her Name with Pride,"Problem with this movie is the very short time Virginia spends in France actually doing her undercover work.The back story of her life takes too much time, and finally tension is short, although finally it is a sad true story."
2,CARVE HER NAME WITH PRIDE,"SHOULD BE DONE AGAIN, UPDATED SINCE ITS A TRUE STORY THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD. VIOLETTE A GREAT HEROINE."
2,Hitler ruined her love life now she will have revenge!!,"CARVE HER NAME WITH PRIDE ( 1958) Directed by Lewis Gilbert.Starring Virginia McKenna, Jack Warner, Billie Whitelaw and Paul Scofield.The true story of plucky English lass Violette Szabo who--after a French boyfriend is killed at Second El Alamein(presumably shot while trying to surrender) decides to do her bit by becoming a behind enemy lines spy. Finally she is sent into France to sabotage bridges on June 6, 1944..........A typical well made stiff upper lip 50s British historical film that still plays like a footnote to THE LONGEST DAY as well as being a WW2 flick for chicks. It probably did not need to be 119 minutes and could have lost a half hour but all that said it is a good film with a pleasing cast, nice black and white photography and worth a look.I liked it. It dramatizes a true story but I am not at all certain it is remarkable in anyway."
1,Packaging and hype ....,Have some othe vacu vin products and decided to buy these beer coolers ....The packaging and the hype were soooooooo cool that I thought that I would be able to down my favorite bubbly a ferw degrees cooler than the fridge. If there is actually any temp decrease using these things I sure didn't notice it ....Better to leave these plastic chillers in the freezer and put the beer in for 5 minutes instead ..... then I notice a difference in the temp of the beer .....Save you money .....
4,"Works well, for a short time","This can chill a warm can in a fairly short amount of time...after that, it loses steam. Unfortunately, the cells that freeze inside of the wrap seem to thaw pretty quickly - even a cold can will start to warm after about 30 min. Years ago I had a hard sided can chiller that used a thin layer of gel as a can koozie and that thing would stay frozen for hours! I'd hoped for something more prolonged like that."
4,great for really cold beer,"4.5 stars really. It does a great job of keeping a beer absolutely ice cold. I can imagine I'll really love it in the summer! It is not like the typical drink ""coozie"". It doesn't just keep your beer cold, it makes it colder! Actually icy! Only minor complaint is that the holder is very cold as well, but I'm sure I'll appreciate that in the summer too! Might make a nice gift for the beer drinker in your life!"
5,Works well! Keeps drinks cold,This works well to keep your drinks cold. I've used it a few times and it actually made my drinks colder and one time it made it icy.
1,Did not ship what was ordered,"Chiller was good, however, sold as set of 2 and only received 1. Was gift with no time to return."
3,okay,I did not exactly feel like I had a clear picture of how to execute the ideas in the book. it did have ideas where to try to implement community based practice settings but I wanted more help how to get it going... left me with more of the same questions prior to reading it...
5,GREAT - gave as a gift,"Gave this to my sister as a gift... it is GREAT. She-who-loses-chargers-weekly can rely on this one as a backup. It's great for travelling and she can just throw it in the car. So far the battery life has been fine... but I sent extra batteries ""just in case"".For anyone who inevitably leaves the car charger in the rental car and the wall charger in the hotel room this is a fantastic solution..."
2,Disappointed,I bought this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer. The cord doesn't fit. I think I can make it fit with a little help from my dremel.
4,Collected Stories of Tennessee Williams.,"I always enjoy Mr. Williams' writings. This was a nice collection of interesting stories I enjoyed reading. I was fortunate to have known this man in 1953 in Houston, and he was as interesting a person as he is an author and playwright."
5,magic,"Williams has a power with words. While not as lyrical as his plays, Williams captures scenes and characters as well as any writer."
1,the game isnt very good,this game i bought because it was awsome for the playstaion 2 and i thought hey it was awsome on that why wouldnt it be on the gameboy advance well i soon found out how wrong i was the game has terrible graphics and is very slow unlike the fast paced ps2 version and when you are behind somone alittle while you can see them even though there is terain in the way?? and i cant say much more about the control and sound for the game
1,worse than my sisters Barbie game,"this game,ssx tricky, is not very fun. I'd rather watch the teletubbuies marathon on pbs kids network and i'm 15 years of age. the company who made this game should do something better with there time, like, get a life"
2,Stick with the Roan Group releases,"Having purchased Vintage's version of ""39 Steps"" [Montage of Mysteries, along with ""Rich and Strange"" and ""Young and Innocent""], and having been satisfied with 2 of the three transfers on that DVD, I decided to take a chance on their Roy Rogers release. While watchable, it is clear not a lot of care was given in transferring these movies. Some of the text on the opening credits is so out of focus it can't be read.My recommendation....stick with the Roan Group releases (Volumes 1-3).[Also, avoid the truncated ""Happy Trails Theatre"" releases by Good Times.]"
2,Rather disappointing,"The poor quality of the film transfers were rather distracting. It made it look like the briteness setting on my TV was too high. Also, 3 out of 4 of these movies are edited versions. Home in Oklahoma was the only movie to be full length. Carson City Kid looks to be missing about 4 minutes. Yellow Rose of Texas has 13 minutes missing, The Cowboy and the Seniorita is missing 23 minutes. Most of what was edited were songs. Unfortunately, no run time information was available on Amazon. The price was pretty good for 4 movies, and if you've never seen Roy in action, it's a cheap way to do so."
4,An enjoyable but slightly flawed album,"The BAD: Overall I prefer _Chairs Missing_, which I think mixes the band's art and pop/rock sides more successfully. A few of the problems: ""The Other Window"" is rather self-indulgent (although it has grown on me), ""A Touching Display"" goes on for about two minutes too long, ""Once is Enough"" seems intentionally annoying. The GOOD: ""I Should Have Known Better"" mixes a gothic sensibility with an almost _Pink Flag_ style minimalism. ""Two People in A Room"" is a great punk song at heart. Musically, ""The 15th"" reminds me of ""Reuters"" and ""I Am The Fly"" on earlier albums. ""Map Ref..."" is one of the band's best songs and is almost worth the price of the album alone. ""40 versions"" is a good, menacing track with well-written lyrics. Several other songs are pretty good too, which makes this an essential, if imperfect purchase, if you have any interest in Wire."
4,Bonus Track Explanation,"According to AllMusic.com regarding the extra tracks: ""The original 1989 CD issue by Restless Retro features four bonus tracks from an experimental EP issued with some copies of the vinyl LP."" I don't know why Amazon lists these tracks on the remastered CD, they're not there."
5,This Is The Standard,"No other record ever made swings as widely as this one: Raw Power (Two People In A Room), Nervous Poetry (The Other Window), Euro Pop (On Returning), Glory (Map Reference) and such a force that sounds like the end of all life, yet you wish it could go on after it is over (A Touching Display). There has never been, nor ever will be, a record quite like this. To describe 154 is to photograph heaven. Lyrically and musically ahead of any other post-punk band by light years, this is the disc I would be stranded with. If you don't have it, get it now, and be ready to re-adjust your views on life."
2,Point of collapse,"This strangely titled album is named after the number of concerts Wire had played up to the time they started recording this piece of avantgarde wave rock. ""154"" is widely regarded as a classic by Wire, but even after several listenings I just don't know why. As the reviewer below said, I also think it's too arty and out-of-focus. The songs are too sketchy, inconsistent, and chaotically arranged. The melodies are often weak and somehow not fully developed. The only song that leaves a lasting impression is ""The 15th"", the rest is hardly memorable and not enjoyable. I think ""Pink Flag"", ""Chairs missing"", and the subsequent 1986 album ""The ideal copy"" are much more rewarding and palatable. Not every snip of music needs to be released, even if it was done by a band called Wire. My advice: Check out the Wire tribute album ""Whore"", featuring great cover versions from bands like Godflesh, Laika, Main, and Bark Psychosis."
3,"Nice, but it's no ""Speak and Spell""!","I don't get this record. I love ""Pink Flag"" and (especially) the sublime ""Chairs Missing"", but ""154"" sounds like it could be a long lost Depeche Mode album. Since such an ""80s""-sounding record was recorded in 1979, I guess I should give it an extra star for its undenible, far-reaching influence, but Wire was never the kind of band that needed anyone's charity. So I won't."
2,A Post-Punk Lowpoint,"I found this album to be both pretentious and boring. Nearly every song begins very slowly and never really gains momentum. Anybody who has made a few dozen mixtapes knows it's a bad idea to have song after song of slow-burners, and this album lacks anything exciting. The songs themselves are not very interesting or catchy and I found the monotone vocals to be annoying and too artsy for a pop groups own good.Track 3 was okay, an obvious single. The album as a whole is a waste of your money and time. Unless you're a real chin stroker, but personally I'd rather listen to Gang of Four."
4,recorded in a tin can,"154 is a disappointing close to wire's relevant period. it's not that the songs themselves are to blame, so much as the production. the only songs that benefit from it are map ref., 40 versions, a mutual friend, & blessed state. it's not as if thorne's production made pink flag and chairs missing, but in wire's case it suits them to have a dry and sharp sound. it pains me to think of what the 15th, single k.o., & once is enough could've been if it weren't for studio overindulgence. all of that put aside, this is a good album. it's most certainly worth buying if you're a fan of pink flag and chairs missing. just be prepared for more goth than you expected."
4,Minimalism gets decorated,"This was the first Wire album that I heard and I was not therefore ""disappointed"" with regards or their previous releases. On the contrary, I found a very rich layered music with very good songwriting beneath the surface. After hearing their previous releases, I begun to understand why some people where ""diappointed"". It is obvious that Wire had probably used-up most of their ideas by the time 154 was released. Nevertheless all the layering of sounds and ambiances where quite an innovation at the time."
4,A Great book for kids.,"This is a delightful comedy that had me smiling or laughing all though the book. For me as an adult, I found myself reminiscing about my days in grammar school and the kids then were no different than they are now. Getting through the day with minimum effort was many students' goal. What makes this such a hilarious book is when the substitute teacher turns the tables on her unruly pupils. I enjoyed the book and think that most kids will relate to this story."
5,A CLASSIC!,"Fellini's NOTTE DI CABIRIA adapted into a Broadway show? Almost impossible! Yet, here it is, wonderfully conceived. The music, the lyrics and the interpreters are terrific. Through the music, you really sense it's Fosse material. This digitally remastered edition is technically perfect. If you have the movie soundtrack, get this theatre version as well because it contains songs that did not appear in the film. Destined to become a landmark in the history of the Broadway show."
5,Superb!,"As I said in my review for the Chicago original Broadway cast, original casts are better than revivals! This is Gwen Verdon at the pinnacle of her career! She renders unforgettable songs like ""If My Friends Could See Me Now"" and ""I'm A Brass Band."" One must also remember ""Big Spender."""
4,Close.. but no Maclaine,"I love the movie, I love the score, so why can't they release the CD of the movie? The songs from this show are classics - Big Spender, If They Could See Me Now. AND, in the movie, SAMMY DAVIS JR sings Rhythm of Life. The cast on this album are talented and peppy, and there's a few songs you don't get in the film. Which is all very nice. But, you know, most people want Sammy and Shirley, surely?"
2,Close but no cigar!,This is an o.k. version of the soundtrack but If you want the complete recording then you have to get the two C.D. version of this musical. This soundtrack cuts off alot of music from the songs alot of the instumentals are omitted from this recording...Shop carefully!
5,Excellent First Aid Guide,"This is an excellent book for basic first aid. The subjects are clearly listed in the quick reference section and are easy to locate. I like the way the book is broken down in sections with corresponding explanations. The section with the Good Samaritan Laws is very informative. The numeration of the required actions when handing an injury are very helpful and easy to follow. The pictures included in the book make the instructions much easier to understand. Like the saying goes, a picture tells a thousand words. The life saving skills summary at the end of the book is an excellent recap of the lessons. I recommend this book to have on hand in case of an emergency."
5,Classical Judo at its best.,"If you've ever wondered just what classical Judo is, this is the video for you. Where other videos just show you techniques, Steve Cunningham shows you the techniques and explains how and why they work, information that is essential to building a strong foundation of skills. Whether you practice Judo as a martial art or an Olympic Sport, this tape will offer you insights into Judo technique that can only improveyour ability. In a genre full of videos that look like home movies, the production values of this video are simply off the scale. Buy this tape, you won't be disappointed."
5,Intelligent look at the Metal genres,"I saw this movie in New York City April 21. I must say that I was refreshed to see a movie that didn't focus on the ""meathead"" stereotype that Metal as a genre has. I was pleasantly surprised to hear intelligent interviews about reasoning, history, folklore and roots of metal. It is good for fans to see their favorite Metal artists talking in an intelligent fashion, which shows that Metal isn't just a no brain, long haired world. Every Metal fan should see this, especially young kids whom think that this genre is all about violence, gore, and satanism. Metal: A Headbangers Journey is the ultimate study in a genre many misunderstand, and many partake in.The movie also features great footage, editing, found footage, and obviously the music featured is spectacular.Great job, I will have the dvd the day it comes out!"
5,the story,"If you were, are or ever wanted to be a metalhead this is a must have. It is great to show to people who have never listened to metal also. A different kind of dvd, watch and enjoy!"
3,Pretty Good,"First of I to say this is a good DVD. However most likely due to time constraits alot of questions are unanswered. I am well versed in my knowledge of metal, but someone who is not may be left scratching there heads at what the hell some of the artists were talking about. My only cheif complaint was the fact that the narrator jumped from genre to genre and left many influential bands off this DVD. To talk about death metal and rarely mention Mercyful Fate..and to not even mention the band Death( the band that started it all in America) should be considered blasphemy in the metal community. I am by no means trying to bash on the narrator, however he should have titled this journey part 1. He then should have focused more time on one or two genres of music instead of trying to pigeon-hole them onto one 96 minute DVD. Overall it is still a good DVD. If anyone wants to agree or disagree with me by all means please email me at manowar200427@yahoo.com"
2,Packaging not as described,I ordered a DVD that was represented with the picture of the store bought DVD case and told that item was used - acceptable. DVD shows up in a clear case.
2,headbanger dvd,the product still has not arrived after a month since order date....I am extremely frustrated. i checked with the post office and they do not have the parcel....how much longer must I wait.Judy Crosby
5,A Brief History Of Metal,"You a Metalhead? Death? Black? Speed or its other variants? Join the author in his journey of the history of metal to its possible future. An eye opener for those who are just into metal, veterans or just plain scared of the word. Get it!"
5,A passion for the subject,"Metal - A Headbanger's Journey is exactly the kind of documentary that the metal scene needs more of. It is intelligent, passionate, and as comprehensive as time would allow. It covers many different subgenres of metal (death, black, traditional, progressive, thrash) and gives you an idea of how they evolved. The interviews are insightful and Sam Dunn does a great job of just sitting back and letting the musicians present themselves and their ideas without guiding or censoring them, really letting individual personalities shine through. I absolutely loved this film and I'd recommend it both for seasoned fans and those new to metal. It's great."
3,"Cute and Whimsical, but.........","I decided to get a small fountain for my desk at work, it's perfect size. However, I had to make several adjustments to the tube that sucks up the water so that the water would come out from the frogs mouth. It does take a little bit of wiggling to get to work."
3,Beware of the Nutcracker re-mastering...,"If you're considering purchasing this for the Nutcracker, don't. Performance-wise, this is still the best of the best, but for this particular edition, Philips apparently re-mastered the recording, taking one of their most brilliant and lucid productions, and muffling it. I did an A-B comparison with the earlier CD immediately upon receiving this one, and it was immediately obvious that the earlier mastering reveals far more instrumental detail and projects a much more realistic soundstage with more air around the instruments.So if you're after a complete Nutcracker, by all means get the Dorati/Concertgebouw original transfer, the one with the Sleeping Beauty excerpts included. You'll be thrilled. This 50th Anniversary edition is an inexcusable sonic disappointment."
3,Dorati competes against himself,"Yes, Dorati's Suites are the most satisfying recorded versions and have been for nearly 40 years.I'm less enthusiastic about this Nutcraker--Dorati bottles up some tempi and the playing is noticeably not up to the Concertgebuow's standard of the period.Both Dorati's other recordings are preferable--the extraordinary London SO on Mercury is full of frisson and more complete, the standard masterly, the conductor at his highest form. You'll have to go to old vinyl for his Minneapolis SO version, historic, still good-sounding, played with involvement and delight.If you still have your vinyl of the London Nutcracker and the Philharmonia Suites, keep it there. Save your dollars for some other great Dorati jewel you don't have yet."
5,The Best from the Best,"Eric Clapton or Slow Hand Clapton really shows off his talents in this great album of some of his greatest hits ever. I still cry when he sings ""Tears in Heaven"". the recording is perfect and I love to sing along with most of songs. Great price for great classics."
4,A good book for Donna Tartt fans,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this - a reader's guide makes it sound like it could be some patronising crap. But it's actually very smart, and even though I thought I knew it all about TSH, it turns out I didn't. Having said that, the author, Ms Hargreaves, missed out a few things, but maybe she didn't have room? Anyhow, she is very good on all the literary references in TSH, especially the Classical stuff. She regurgitates the most interesting parts of DT's printed interviews (shame she couldn't get a new one for this book, but not surprising I guess!), and I came away even more convinced of what a weird, wonderful one-off novel TSH is. Which makes me terrified that DT's new one will suck, but we'll have to see...Definitely recommended, unless you really do know everything about the book already!"
4,office chair,very comfortable...easy to adjust the seat height..wish i could adjust the back height which would allow me to control lumbar pressure too..
4,Kenwood eXcelon KAC-X621,"I purchased this amplifier to hook it up to a 1200 watt 12"" subwoofer. It sounds great. I specially like the digital bass/treble adjustments on the front. I'm not an expert, but I sure recommend it."
5,beautiful,"After 4 years of waiting, still no sign of any new material. Wher are they now? I read on Bellaunion.com in 2003 they were working on a new album and Josh was going to release a solo album. Well, that was 2 years ago, so I am guessing these guys have broken up.Yes, it has elements of Jeff Buckley. Not intentionally. Joshes voice is just similar sounding. Beautiful in fact, but without the range of Jeff. And yes the guitar sound could be similar to My bloody valentine. But there is no intentional plagarism here.Just beautifully delivered music. Perfect infact. Don't let the religious content of the music put you off, I didn'tIt is beautiful. Buy it.Oh by the way, ignore the amazon desription up top. It has nothing to do with this band or or this release."
1,Not worth to buy,This product is not good. Actually it is a thin film not a plastic card. I prefer to keep it in wallet but every time I insert it I am afraid to crease it. Also there is defective area in the center of card that distorts image. Seller is good but product is NOT.
3,Couple of great songs... Not his best..,"Joe Diffie is my favorite entertainer but I think that this albumn could have used another couple of songs to make it complete. It is a good offering of ""Diffie"" and although it isn't his best, I liked it anyway."
4,"""...ya got me pretty good, buddy...""","these guys are great. the self-billed ""Scariest Band In The World"", they put out some awesome, chest thumpin' psychobilly and evil blues. I thought this album had it all, songs about dead hobos, dead women, dead gangsters.The only thing I didn;t get was that this is not an 'edited' version, to my knowledge there's only one version, but they still bleep out all the f-bombs. A strange choice, why include em in the lyrics if your just gonna bleep em?Still good tho... my favorite tracks are ""It Was You"", ""The Hearse"", and ""Someday I Will Kill You""."
4,A hard-hitting relationship chronicle,"In this first book of his, Richard King focuses on the relationship between two young people. What is so original about that, one might be inclined to wonder. For a start, the narration alternates between the two main characters, the guy and the girl, thereby establishing a 'both sides of the story' approach. It is interesting to see how the two characters see the same events from incredibly different points of view. For anyone who's ever complained about not understanding the opposite sex, this is THE book. The chronicle of the relationship is very frank and we see exactly what happens between the characters (from the sublime to the banale) as the relationship runs its course. There is no way that you will not find a part of yourself in this story if you're ever been young..."
4,Great gameplay and graphics!!!,"This is the best FIFA since 1997!!! It has a whole new game engine, and it realy gets close to the real sport. The passing, defending and even shooting is very well recreated. Your player will only shoot if the ball is close to his feet, just the way it is supposed to be! The defense is great, the final scores are usualy 2-1 or 2-3 at the most, like the real sport.The drawbacks: NO COSTUMIZATION. You're unable to create custom teams or custom formations. Also some of the world's best clubs are not available like Argentina's Boca Jr. And also some big absents like Holland in the country teams. It would have been nice to have all of these features available in the other EA titles."
5,"Finally, A Good, Game For, Us Soccer gamers!!!!!!!!!","This Game is awesome!!!! It is sooooooo ccooooool, I defiantly think you should buy this game. A perfect game for Soccer gamers (in coulding myself ). I don't own this game, but I am pretty sure that I am going to get it for Christmas, anyway, the game is soo cooool that if you were a soccer fan you should buy this game, even if you weren't a soccer fan you would love this game..... So I give you two options... 1; Buy this game now... 2: Don't buy this game, and you are miserable, for a couple of years........ THIS GAME IS SSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CCCCCCCCCCCCCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL"
3,Good looking product,"Solid, sturdy, and a good fit for my 2008 Ram 1500. You do have to drill holes to install, which can be a little tricky as the under side of the bed rails don't have a lot of room for the washer and nut.I'm happy with my purchase."
4,A fun read,"I've read every one of Parker's Spenser books since the '70s. Some are a bit of a disappointment, others are a pleasant surprise - but he never fails to entertain me. I thought this book was one of his better efforts in recent years (as most Spenser fans know the first four books in the series were the best - he's never quite attained that level again.) But I actually thought the plot in this one was pretty interesting and he kept me guessing what was going to happen. Also, like every great fictional detective from Philip Marlowe to Jim Rockford, Spenser has his own moral code that he lives his life by. I love that!"
3,"Better than recent average, but still.......","With three series going, it is safe to say that Parker is now writing these in his sleep. His dialogue still crackles, and Susan manages to be less annoying in this book. Still, if you're going to write such a simple plot, at least give us a few Spenser action sequences to enjoy. The ending is far darker than your normal Spenser, but is jarringly so.If you like Parker, give it a read. If you've never tried him, start with an earlier novel."
3,Not the best not the worst,"After you have read enough of this series, you have certain expectations. For me, it is that i will find a book with a very good plot that has not been revisited a million times, a couple of characters besides the main character (of course) that will pique my interest, and very good dialogue. This book has a pretty good plot, but there really isn't all that much going on in this book. The story seems, at times, to lose momentum and become nothing but dialogue. I love the Spencer novels for the fact that the main character is always the redeeming quality even if the book suffers in some spots. I just didn't see the flair I have become accustomed to in this book. It wasn't bad, but certainly not my favorite out of this series. It was a little better than okay."
1,Borrring!,"Okay, I'm new to Robert B Parker's Spencer (other than old TV series with Robert Urich). But this thing was a disaster! Predictable. Too much cutesy dialog. And what's with Susan and her Harvard Ph.D.? So what? Give it a rest! Characters one dimensional and shallow. Seems Mr. Parker was wanting badly to wrap this turkey up but just couldn't find a way to do it. So he plods along with a plot that was clear after the first 25 pages (or sooner). Yeah, yeah he's made $$$s writing for years and has been a top crime writer for years. Taking nothing away, but maybe it's time to do something else. Have a Jessie Stone waiting in the wings to read, but after this one am a bit gun shy (no pun intended) of whether or not I want to waste time. Wasn't knocked out with this one."
2,my last Spencer,I am sorry to say this will be my last Spencer. I don't want to read the next one where Susan is in the hospital for malnutrition and Spencer is on welfare because he never makes any money and Hawk loses muscle tone through lack of action. But it has been a great run - i just don't want to be there when the reviews put it over the cliff. Its' getting close.
1,Hundred-Dollar Baby,"I have this book in audiobook format and was most happy to get it, I though for sure this would be a great book, I have more of Robert Parker books but have not had time to read them, as he is a new author I have just discover, so it came as some surprise that his books read look direction for a play are something I could only listen to about ten mintues of I said and she said before I had to turn it off, I though this would be a great book and I guess it would be if you can get pass the ""I SAID AND SHE SAID"" I mean who talk like this ""Wow"" I said "" a message."" I wonder how many time the word said was used in this book."
3,Please get rid of Susan,My husband and I are both loyal Spenser fans but are so tired of his relationship with Susan and their tedious conversations. My husband wants him back with Rita. I just want Susan gone. Women her age often get breast cancer.
2,Good dialogue - No story,"This is a total waste of your time, IMHO. You know you are going to get three page chapters and lots of white space, but Parker usually manages to tell you a story and often quite well. Not this time.Spencer meanders around and around while everyone lies to him about what he is investigating, he and Susuan have some snappy chat, he and Hawke much less so and then the book is over in a very forced and unsatisfying way. You wait and wait for the story to pick up and get interesting, but it never does.Pass on this one."
1,SAID,"I had not read the other books in this series and I did like the story overall, but one thing that was very annoying and even distracting is the use of the word ""SAID"". Absolutely every time someone talked the word ""SAID"" was used. The whole book even ended on the word ""SAID"". Maybe it is not as noticeable when you read the book, but I was listening to it on the audio version and it was so distracting I started counting the word ""SAID""!! One time I counted 10 ""SAID""s in 1 minute!! I am not sure if the author was going for a ""Guinness World Book"" record with the number of ""SAID""s used in a book, but I am sure if he was that he got the record! I wish the book would be re-written taking out all of the ""SAID""s and using alternate words, in my opinion that would have made the book so much better!!"
2,ho hum,"I lost my first review, so let me try again. I thought this book was tired. Does he really need the money to churn out less than stellar Spenser novels?The plot was not terribly interesting and the repartee was just flat. I also have felt that Spenser's so-called observations about feminist/feminism are the couch potato sort and I'd expect more from someone who usually writes better. Admittedly, the last several RBP books have made some misguided statements about feminists/feminism that read like he has merely gleaned through a newspaper and done no research.I don't know if I'll read the next Spenser novel at this rate. I've read them all thus far and most in my family read them as well. However, this was just a tawdry book."
2,More like 99 Cents,I was greatly disappointed by this novel. There's no surprises and you will not have a hard time guessing the outcome. I have read better Spencer novels. I will wait for the next one.
3,Robert B. Parker - You Are a Better Writer Than This Book!,"Perhaps with your background, you could have explained to the reader why a girl like this would have suddenly started to murder people. This does not seem real. Yes, she was a messed up young woman, but murder? I find this hard to believe. The dialog with Hawk was boring, the relationship with Susan was boring. I hope you get it right next time. I want to read a book that includes Hawk, Susan, Pearl and Spencer. Janet Evanovich has been able to give equal time to her new series. I think you are spreading yourself thinly.I used to be a big fan, I'm losing it..."
2,Hundred-Dollar Baby,"This was not Robert B. Parker's best Spenser novel. Loved the banter between Spenser and Hawk, as I always do, but the story itself was a little weak."
3,okay to read along but not quite exciting,"this one, like all the other spenser series, readable but not very exciting and always so predictable, like watching ants crawling along an abstract path. the edge of this series has long gone. the structure of this one is just like the others, a very formulaic storyline with overly pretentious coolness of spenser and his peers with wisecracking dialogs, sometimes throwing in some spelling bee contest uncommon and rarely used difficult words. again, every chapter with susan is like a quick summary of all the chapters's development after the last chapter when spenser talked to susan to summarize what the most pretentious woman on earth happened in between. actually, all the chapters with susan, like always, could be omitted to speed up the tempo a little bit."
3,"Unchallenging plot, characters (but the pages fly)","Perhaps longtime Parker readers know what to expect in a Spenser novel, and now I do, too. In Spenser's world, every hooker has a heart of gold and every tough guy has a soft spot for damsels in distress (who are all hookers with hearts of gold, in this story.) So everyone who's bad is good...or, not THAT bad. Except the bad guys.The story moves along if for no other reason than there are few words on the pages. Loads of dialog moves the story. So much that it appears Mr. Parker went in after the fact and added some requisite scene setting; usually a few sentences about how much snow was on the sidewalk.This is a book for a sunny day at the beach. I prefer my page-turners to have a little more meat on the bone."
3,The usual Parker,"Spenser, Hawk and Susan. Ought to have everything. But the plot is a little slow and a rehash of prior books.A good read, for a sequal."
2,Hundred-Dollar Baby,"I used to eagerly grab up any book by Robert B Parker, but its getting so, that... if you've read one. You've read them all. Its like he has a cookie-cutter template and uses it to write every book he puts out. They're so predictible, you can read the first chapter, then the last, and not miss a thing in between. The storylines, the elements that motivate the characters...they are all the same. No matter if its Spenser, or Jesse Stone. I bet they are brothers... and have the same ideas about everything!"
3,Technical - For Professionals and Wannabes,"I figured out on my own that rolling on a ball was a very effective way to deal with my back problems. According to the book I even figured out the exactly correct size ball for my size. I figured that this book would provide some great additional info. Frankly, it probably does, but the terminology and assumed knowledge of anatomy is so great that I quickly got glassy-eyed.Bottom line: The technique is great, and the book is informative, but unless you have a technical background in body work, or are highly motivated to learn about this technique on your own, it's too difficult of a read to get a lot out of."
1,Too technical and not user-friendly,very hard book to get to grips with. I gave up after the first chapter
5,Funniest video I have ever seen,I've got pretty high standards for comedy. It really has to be clever and well written to amuse me. I have now watched this video about 6 times and never tire of watching it again - especially sharing it with friends who also generally agree that it is one of the funniest they have ever seen either. Wanda Sykes is the master of facial expressions - and of humor that reaches into the heart of us all. She is truely a comic genius.
1,Not happy!,Not happy with this movie as it does not have closed caption/subtitles. What do people think that deaf/hard of hearing people will not buy this? We will not be able to enjoy and laugh with or like hearing people. All hearing people think of is hearing people only!
4,More Hilarity -,"Wanda Sykes is just hilarious and constantly keeps you laughing throughout. This is her second comedy special for HBO done in 2009 and she comments on Barack Obama's presidency, her new life in a interracial lesbian marriage, Bikini waxing and being a performer on a all gay cruise ship with 3,200 couples. She is amazingly funny, honest and provocatively rough around the edges. Her ability to entertain is enormous and she is a strong and fearless woman. Wanda has much strength to admire, sharp wit to enjoy and it all comes out in fearless comedy."
4,another great scarey kids movie,I bought this movie for my son who loves scary movies. He really likes it.
4,Entertaining,I have always been a fan of R.L. Stine. My children and I would watch the shows when they were younger. We liked the suspence and far out tales. This is not for younger children though.
1,Not recommended,I would not advise wasting money on the $2 kindle version. It does not come with an internal table of contents so you cannot jump around it.
1,Rubbish,Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. You may think it is a work to inform you about the Talmud - but it is really a horrible critique by a rabid anti-semite.
2,Yikes! Stick with the studio recordings!,"This cd is interesting only as a novelty recording. I love The Monkees, but this live show just isn't very good. The sound is bad and unfortunately the boys just can't reproduce the songs on stage (they didn't really play on most of them originally, and they don't have the right equipment set up to do a decent job anyway). It's sort of embarrassing: Mike's eternal chord strumming (no leads or riffs...just chords); Mickey's limited drumming (drumming that he never actually did on most of the studio versions of the songs they cover). It's kinda cool to hear them out there giving it a try, but they really don't succeed. There's gotta be some recordings somewhere from '68 that must be better (I hope!)."
3,Decent concert,"The sound quality is poor, both because of the technical limitations of 1967 and also because of the noise of the fans. For this reason, one is not likely to want to listen to this CD more than once or twice. Still, it's a good historical document that the Monkees did in fact play live and acquit themselves pretty well. They also throw in many lesser known numbers that Monkees fans will find interesting; not all of them are good but they show the Monkees had some variety too. Their sometimes hyper performance culminates with ""I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone,"" a good song that they make exciting with their enthusiasm. So, for big fans, this is a fun period piece. Newcomers to the Monkees should definitely look elsewhere."
2,"Bootleg quality, good performances","The sound quality is awful, worse than most bootlegs. Having said that, the Monkees perform adequately at worst, good at best (although it's often difficult to hear the individual instruments) and they demonstrate professional humour throughout. How about a live set from the '80's or '90's, Rhino?"
4,Summer of 1967,"Live 1967 was released in July of 1987. Live 1967 was one of four Monkees album that came out that and may explain why it did not chart. The twelve songs on this chart are from the 1967 summer tour. Side 2, track 6 is from Seattle, Side 1 tracks 1-5; Side 2 tracks 4 & 5 from Portland, and Side 1, track 6; Side 2, tracks 1-3 from Spokane. Since the songs are from a concert the clarity is not very good. The songs are from The Monkees debut album, More of The Monkees and Headquarters album. Still I am giving Live 1967 a B+.Side OneLast Train To Clarksville#1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#1 CashboxYou Just May Be The OneThe Girl I Knew Somewhere#39 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesI Wanna Be FreeSunny GirlfriendYour Auntie GrizeldaSide TwoForget That GirlSweet Young ThingMary, MaryI'm A Believer#1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles (7 seven weeks at #1)#1 CashboxRandy Scouse Git(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone#20 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#25 Cashbox"
4,Great Energy!,"It was 1967, the technology for recording live shows wasn't very good. Most of the time they tried mixing it down right to a reel to reel, which meant you took what you got and couldn't go back to fix it later.The only thing I could really complain about is the mix. Sometimes you can't hear dolenz's voice, sometimes the person singing background is louder than the lead, sometimes a guitar overpowers the rest.But the performance is great! Classic garageband style glory!This is a must have for a monkees fan.I have both the cd and the LP, and I advise getting the LP, it has a more rich sound."
3,"Well, I've certainly heard worse live albums","and this one does have a spunky, garage-band appeal to it, but at the same time, how many spunky garage bands would you actually want to listen to? The kind of cd you enjoy if you play it just once in a rare while.By the way, was it actually Peter Tork who yelled that ""If you don't shut up there'll be no show"" remark? A few previous comments have stated that, but I didn't think it sounded like him, vocally or personality-wise."
3,THIS ALBUM IS OK!,"THIS ALBUM MAKES ME KINDA DISSAPOINTED. THE MONKEES ARE THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD BUT I THOUGHT THE SOUND WAS HORRIBLE IN THIS CD. BUT OVERALL, TRUE FANS WILL LIKE IT."
3,"Pay for soup, Build a fort , Set that on fire","Pay for the pleasure of this diamond in the rough....maybe, if you are into garage music....Yes, garage music is what this sounds like. It is ""Kurt Cobain"" had he lived. The recording quality is good for its time(1967). the performance is very good but often rushed. The in-between song chatter is witty and slows the pace enough for the listener to build a fort and then the song starts, again into the fire....."
3,fault lines in South America,"If you're interested in something different and interesting, this book is for you. It reads quickly and is an overview of plate tectonics/geology which even a layman such as I can follow."
1,Total rip-off!!,"I purchased this product brand new and was only able to use one of the two licenses supportedly available with it. Then I was able to log-on only once and was locked out with an authorization error. I have repeatedly attempted to contact this company, it appears they are not supportive of their product. The one time I did get into the program it seemed to be vague and very simplistic with prompts for upgrade purchases. To avoid an unnecessary headache, save your money and do not buy this product."
1,Won't run on Win98,"Despite what it says on the box and on the CD jewel case, this software will neither intall nor run on Win98. It requires NT4, Win2K or WinXP. Of course, you have to buy the software, have the install fail, and email Sybex tech support before they tell you that..."
3,"good, but there is a better one","This is the first product of this kind that I searched for and purchased. One good thing is that you can load already built networks and configure them. And it was ok that you could drag, drop, and build your own. After working with it for a while I discovered it had a maximum number of routers, switches, and hosts you can use. You can have a maximum of 3 routers, 4 switches, and 6 hosts. However, when I got deeper into my studies I needed to work with more equipment but you are limited here. I searched around again for a better package and realized that I could upgrade at routersim to the network visualizer program. I wish I would have purchased that first. There are no limits to the equipment you can use to create a network, plus, that program seems to support a lot more commands that match the new cisco curriculum."
2,Buy the CCNA Gold Edition Used.,"This product offers nothing of value over the Gold edition except for drag and drop. Creating my first network, I was shocked that I was limited in adding only two switches and three routers. Not much playing around or building with that limitation!Todd Lammle, the Gene Simmons of Cisco training material, forces you to upgrade for any additional functionality on this already extremily over priced, very basic program.Do yourself a favor and save your money and buy the used Gold version."
1,Pretty much useless,"This has to be one of the worst hundred bucks I've ever spent. Thank goodness my employer reimbursed me for it. Things that suck:1) you're limited to soo few network devices not a huge deal but why? It's kinda lame2) The amount of supported commands and features are far too small. I was able to do basic routing protocols, but even with those the commands were very limited. I was unable to do NAT which really disturbed me. Everything I WANT to do, I cant do because this software doesn't support the features. This is decent at best for the first half of the CCNA course where you only cover the basic basic routing protocols, anywhere past that this is completely useless.3) There's more but this software isn't worth my time to spell it all out.Dont waste your money on this, seriously I'm very disappointed."
5,A-Z,My son and I loved learning about and praying for these Bibleless people groups. He was always amazed to hear that they did not have Bibles in their own language.
3,Disappointing,"Nice product, but the disappointment begins when you try to burn a DL DVD. DL DVDs are not accepted and that is simply ridiculous!"
1,Sony VRDVC30 is an excellent product.,It came within one week of being ordered. It is an excellent product and is as advertised. I received a manual for Sony's Compact Disc Recorder instead of the manual for the VRDVC30.
5,Transfer home video to DVD,"I transfered video directly to the DVD with 15 minutes of reading the manual and hooking up the device. It was easy, with clear instructions. The DVDs paly on any DVD player. I don't see how it could be any easier. Video and audio came through great. I'm very happy with the DVDirect."
2,Not User Friendly,"All information provided for this recorder advertises ease of use. We bought the recorder so that we could transfer video from our harddrive digital video camera directly to a DVD while we were on vacation. Every time we used the recorder it would reject the first disk inserted. It locked up three times the first time we tried transferring videos. I don't trusts the equipment. I had to find a DVD player while on vacation to be sure that our video was transferred before I would erase it off of the video camera. This is a very touching piece of equipment and requires a lot of patience. I think we are going to return the item, since we were unable to get it to work properly."
1,Never got this unit to work properly.,"I had high hopes for this burner, as I had used a VC20 unit at work, and never had a problem with it. The additional quality setting and PAL standard were all plusses for me when purchasing the VC30, HOWEVER, I never got a SINGLE video disc burned on the unit to play properly on my DVD player. I tried a dozen different brands of DVD media, in all formats...+/-R, +/-RW, DL, made no difference. Even with SONY brand discs...all became coasters. Huge disapointment.Sadly, the Amazon Marketplace vendor from whom I bought it WOULD NOT replace it or refund my money, saying it was SONY's responsibility, and SONY wouldn't be responsible for it either, telling me to return it to the vendor for a replacement...(buyer beware, read into every Marketplace vendor's return policies CLOSELY!), so I was stuck selling it to somebody with whom I work, who uses it for PC only.Not what I had expected."
3,NO THAT GOOD,NOT AS GREAT AS I EXPECTED.AFTER ALL I HOPED THAT BECAUSE IT WAS SONY IT SHOULD BE TOP OF THE LINE. THIS UNIT IS SLOW AND YOU CANNOT SEE WHAT YOU ARE RECORDING UNTILL IT IS FINISHED. HENCE IF THERE ARE ANY ERRORS YOU JUST WASTED A WHOLE 2 HRS OF YOUR TIME. ALSO OLD VHS TAPES MAY NOT RECORD PROPERLLY IF THEY HAVE ANY GLTCHES IN THEM.
5,I love this!,I bought this to go with my Sony DCR-SR40 camcorder. It was so easy to burn the dvd's! I just hooked the usb cord up between the camcoder and the DVDirect and pressed burn dvd. It was so simple & easy.
2,Terrariums & Miniature Gardens,"I was very disappointed in this book. I thought it would give tips for making a garden,not tips for making your own garden Container."
3,they are ok,"its an ok set, they are a bit heavy though, i ended up buy some plastic poly ones to lighten my gun up a bit."
5,M&P15a,I bought these rails for my M&P15a. They work as they should and are a great bargain. I recommend them to anyone shopping around.
2,Didn't work on Stag M2 or Colt AR-15,"Holes didn't line up well, and much loser than a standard foregrip and M4 attachment should be. Might work for others, but junk in my book"
5,solid product,This is an inexpensive alternative to the quadrail systems. It was easy to install and does the job very well.
1,Not as advertised,"The rail was not as advertised. The pic showed a swivel, no swivel was sent. When I contacted the company, they said they didn't create the original ad. BS if you ask me. Also, the rail was not tapered. Bad product, bad customer service."
4,Didn't fit exactly,"These work, but the mounting screws and nuts/washers didn't work perfectly. They didn't get tight enough with the use of another washer. Nbd, made it work. Also, some of the reviews said these were tapered to offset the slant of the hand grip... that's not the case. My grippod I mounted to the bottom rail isn't exactly vertical because of it."
1,Item sent was not as pictured,I sent it back and they covered the freight. Not of good quality and different than what was pictured. I would not do this again.Others have stated the same thing. Much smaller in length than I could use. I went by the picture and counted the rails because they dont list a size on the product info....a simple size would be good to list for the purchaser???........
4,Weaver Rails,It fits a little loose but stays put when you tighten it.It is designed to hold onto the plastic part of the grip so time will tell if it is going to hold up or break the grip. Seems to work for now well see.
4,good product,Excellent product. Does just what it says and fits my ar15 perfect. Only reason I gave four stars is because they are not long enough for what I needed. These are only 4 inches long but the ad didn't say how long they were. You need at least a five inch rail for the handgrips because after installing a foregrip I have no room for a bipod or flashligh. Works great just too short.
4,Cheap Way to Outfit an AR,"I was deciding between this weaver rail set and a quad rail system. Since I only wanted to put something on the bottom of my handguard (bipod and foregrip) and nothing on the sides or top, this was the cheaper, better option. I put one of the rails on a Chiappa .22 upper and the other on a standard AR upper. It fit with no problem on the standard AR upper, but I had to add washers for the .22 upper, as it was a bit loose.Pros:- Easy to install- Attached very securely to the standard AR upper- Accessories attach with ease and fit tightly- Solid build and materialCons:- About an inch shorter than the handguard. I wish it was a bit longer to fit a bipod and foregrip at the same time- Was loose on the .22 upper, so I had to add some washersI would definitely suggest this product to others."
5,weaver rail set,Exactley what I needed. Came with screws and nuts to install. Received them when they said I would. Would order from this company again.
2,Doesnt fit quite right.,I bought these rails for my S&W M&P15 sport. The way they are attached to the original rails doesnt allow you to tighten them enough. I attached a fore grip to this rail and it shakes when fired. I recommend you save your money and buy quality rails.
3,Great product poor fit,The material is strong and durable. It would not fit over my gas tube was only able to mount on bottom. I ended up purchasing a quad rail at sportsman warehouse for 50$. Would work if they designed it to fit around gas tube.
5,M4 AR 15 Weaver Rail Set,I got exactly what I wanted at a great price. Great stuff. I would definitely order from them again. It came within a good period of time.
4,As advertised,They fit & work (nothing gets 5 stars). Now I must put in more words to fulfill a silly requirement
1,don't buy - it is too short,"Once you put the bipod on it, there is barely enough space to put hand grip. Also, the installation is not user friendly, I only managed to put two screws onto the rail and for several times it was still kind of loose."
1,Because there is no ZERO star option.,This item sold by airsplat typifies there penchant to falsy advertise. IF you want to get bait and switch merchandise be sure to use airsplat.
5,great piece of gear,I bought a plain ar-15 (M16A2) with no rail system. My son inlaw bought me these. They are great. Very easy to install on your handguards. Put 2 on in 1 min. Took longer to wrestle the handguards off. So now i can buy a broom handle and bipod for my AR.
3,Consider the angles,"If you have a tapered fore-end grip like the S&W; M&P;, these rails will NOT be parallel with the barrel.Apparently, in 2009 this product compensated for the taper. That was then, this is now (2 star deduction).If you do not have that issue of it does not matter, this is a great product for the money. In my case it is for a bi-pod so it does not matter. It comes as two packages of one rail and allen wrench each."
4,good for the money.,This product was easily installed. Seems pretty sturdy. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 was I haven't used it at the range yet.
3,Weaver Rail Set,I mounted these to a M&P; AR-15 and the screws it came with were too long and left the rail loose.I had to create a thicker washer with rubber to make it work.I'm assuming that other handguards would function better than others though.
2,Technical disappointment,"First of all, I'm a Rangers fun. I was looking forward to Messier's 2 disc ""collectors"" version promoted since last year, which was released this year as a 1 disc rehash. What a disappointment.Then this Rangers 1994 15 disc set.As other reviewers mentioned, this is edited game coverage of Conference finals against NJ, and Stanley Cup finals against VAN.I take one star away because of this cuts.Once I started to watch the set, I noticed the video quality of several segments are poor in Game 5 and 7 against NJ.I take another star away.Then the Game 2 against VAN, what terrible footages in 3rd period! Momentary black outs. Worst one lasting about one second.I can't believe they release this kind of poor footages for hefty price.As a die hard Ranger fan, I want NHL production or WB to replace those defective footages and send to us without charge."
4,"I mean, Come on...","Yea good job winning over a decade ago, but you guys gotta stop living in the past. The Rag team is good this year and to bring out a 15 dvd set (15 freaking dvd's are you kidding me?!?!) seems to take away from their good season this year.What's next? A 45 DVD set due out next year celebrating the Rags return to the playoffs this year???"
4,Wrong info,"The product description lists this as having the 7 games of the Western Conference finals. Well, New York and New Jersey are hardly west! It should read EASTERN Conference Finals."
1,Could only watch it once!!,"Like the other reviewers, I couldn't agree more. I went to the concert when he came down here to New Zealand, and the concert still stands as one of the best concerts I have ever been to, and believe me, I have been to a lot!!So I was very keen to have a record of this great concert but this was total [hogwash]. Not the show!! The visual presentation of the show. I can't even watch it, its done so badly. Here's a tip Mr Director, just point the camera towards the stage area - and walk away!! Believe me it would have been better if he did.See if you can rent it first before you buy it."
1,Disappointing,"The song Long And Winding Road is entirely a documentary about the Vietnam war, instead of seeing Paul sing. I bought this DVD in order to let my mum see Paul sing this song. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING."
4,Takes you to the Throne!,"I'm so glad I purchased this. It surpasses entertainment, and definitely leads you to worship the One True, and Worthy God..."
5,Thankful for the words on the CD,"I recently experience Alicia's music through the THRIVE Seminar and was thoroughly blessed. She encouraged me with her music and willingness to bless others with her gift from God. Since purchasing the CD, I have listened to it a lot. It has helped me during the rough times and easy times. I pray that Alicia will continue creating CDs that blesses. This is a very anointed CD!..."
3,uninspired,Most selections were mediocre versions without enthusiasm from band members. Missed the drive of a Buddy Rich.
5,Perfection,"I love this CD for its versatile range of songs. I have always been a fan of Dame Kiri but have never bought any of her CD's until now - what a loss of time and enjoyment!!!Dame Kiri's voice is rich, golden and pure. Each and every song is a treasure to listen to even if you haven't heard some of them before, like me for instance.I will be playing this CD often. Don't make the mistake I did, buy it now, don't wait twenty years."
3,"Eskalation - 'Different Music For Bassoon,Wind.....' (Musea)","Full title: 'Different Music For Bassoon, Wind Synthesizer And Sampled Percussion'. German musician Stephan Kohr more or less IS Eskalation. From what I've been able to find out, Kohr is a bassoon specialist. Never even knew there was such a thing. All ten cuts on 'Diferent Music...' were entirely composed and recorded using bassoons, samples, wind controlled synthesizers and keyboards. Boy, JUST when I think I've heard it all. The only way I could even begin to describe this disc is progressive experimental. Kohr has reportedly played in several Avant Garde and fusion bands before. If you like artists / composers such as Art Zoyd, Magma, Wendy Carlos or Univers Zero, then give 'Different...' a shot. It's decent."
3,Unrealistic,"Playing NBA live 2003 you don't get the feel of a real sim game like you would playing 2k3. First off the play is extremely fast and the fast breaks are ridiculous. The shooting is the most unreal thing on the game. How can a player come down and hit five three pointers in a row? The graphics are the only thing that save this game. Soundtrack is solid but the gameplay is what I pay attention to most. Centers don't block layups or dunks. The only thing you can really block is a jumpshot and that's a problem when small guards e.g.(John Stockton) can block Paul Pierce's shot. Overall though live is much better than last years so EA sports do get points for that. Other than that if you want a ""realistic"" basketball game this is not the one."
4,I've seen better sega genesis B-ball games than this!,"This game is absolutely horrible. I am a big basketball fan and obviously I am going to get a game. I had previously owned NBA Live '99 and '00 for my PC. These games aren't bad but no one plays em anymore. When I got my XBOX I was looking for an NBA game. I thought about NBA 2K3 and NBA IDrive. From the beginning NBA Live 2003 was out. I played it at my friends house, who had rented it. The game play was back and forth every time a fastbreak or a three pointer. One game the score after one quarter was 52-37 in a 6 MINUTE quarter. My friend also showed me his franchise. The minute we got in a screen popped up. The Bulls offer you Jayson Williams (82) for Jason Kidd (94). We were shocked. Why the HELL would anyone make a stupid trade like that? The one good and cool part in this game are the throwback jerseys that the teams wear. Overall I'd rate this game a 1.9 out of 10.0. It is just an all around bad game."
2,I don't like it.,"I originally owned a PS1 and religiously bought every NBA Live game as soon as it came out. So, when I bought the X box the first game I bought was NBA Live 2003. I played it for a month or so. While this game has a lot of great features and game situations, it just is not fun. A video game should be fun to play and after a month I can't play this any more. I have been playing NBA inside drive 2002 that came bundled with the X box. This game is fun to play although it is lacking in the features that NBA Live 2003 has. I will purchase Inside Drive 2003. I have read that they have added better features."
2,Get over yourself,"I'm sorry, they may be sweedish, but the lyrics are in English. The lyrics are also terrible. The music isn't bad but the lead singer is so self-rightious I could puke blood. His arrogance overshadows the whole thing. This cd is mind numbing."
2,Great product but over priced!,This definitely keeps cans cold But I believe that the price is double what it sould be. If money is no object buy it....
5,great coolers,"Put in freezer gell gets very cold, pull a soda from fridge slip on cold cooler and my cold drink keeps getting colder as I drink, what's not to like. Great product"
5,silver can chillers,"Bought these can chillers for my husband, and he loves them. Only thing Is I need to get some morefor when friends come over. This product is great. Very fast shipping from amazon, and product was just as they discribed. Thank you amazon."
2,Liquid inside of the pockets doesn't freeze solid,"These can chillers barely have any chilling effect on warm cans. Maybe, if you have a cold can to begin with and just want to use this product when it is very hot outside to sip your drink slowly... maybe then it works better at keeping it cold for a little bit longer, but I find these can chillers to be almost useless. I had them in my freezer for more than a day, but when I took them out, the liquid inside was not completely frozen and chillers itself were not that cold to the touch. Maybe I got a defective product because the description says ""Sleeves' 6 pockets contain special liquid that freezes solid"" and mine doesn't (?) I guess, I will have to return them."
3,"Okay, but not great","They do work for keeping a soda cold, but they do not make a drink that is room temperature cold. Just a bit cool. Not really worth the money or the trouble unless you like to ""nurse"" a can of soda for long periods of time."
3,"OK, not great.","These can chillers are just sleeves, so the bottom is not chilled; therefore, the beverage does not stay as cold as it could if a bottom were incorporated into the design. Does not take up much room in the freezer. ""The Fridge"" can coolers are 10X better than these."
3,Does work,Does not stay cold very long but does work. Cannot leave on while drinking from can. Would buy again as it does cool beverage
2,Rapid Ice Coolers,"Very disappointed. The discription says it is a two pack, but there is only one cooler in the packaging."
1,JUNK,"Works if you have COLD soda and it's frozen. After 2 cans it's done. Yes you get two of the sleeves, but I'm not pleased. Better luck with a 99 cent foam coozie"
2,Doesn't freeze completely,"I wanted a product that would keep my drink cold at work. I work in an office so this shouldn't be a difficult task. These can chillers keep my drink cold for about an hour, maybe. I think they would work great if they froze solid (as they claim) or if they were insulated. I was very disappointed in this product and will continue to search for a drink chiller that works!"
1,Absolutely worthless,"These are absolutely worthless. Not only do they not KEEP cans cold, they actually suck the coldness out of them. Mine went into the trash fast."
1,All six of my guests we're EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!,"I purchased two sets of the can/bottle holders for an outdoor pool party. Sure they looked sleek & assumed they would do a great job (especially being frozen & all of drinks we're well chilled.) After we all had used them, we all agreed...a big waste of money. They do not freeze solid, do not keep drinks cold longer than ~20 minutes-if fact we all agreed that my old foam drink kozies that I purchased for 99 did a better job. We we're even sitting at our shaded patio table with an overhead fan blowing on us. A real waste of money! I read & trusted all those positive reviews. I want to know what they were using? Maybe they were using them in the dead of winter in Alaska. I want my money back!"
2,Freezes solid?? What??,"These drink coolers do keep your drink cold for a little while. On the other hand, they absolutely do NOT freeze solid. They are thawed completely in about two hours. When I put a cold refrigerated beverage(carbonated) in the drink cooler it makes the drink slush instantly and foam out the top forcing me to pour half of it out. all in all, disappointed."
4,"Four stars, but only because of omissions.","If you must only have a snapshot of this incredible band, then a ""best of"" will do. Criminally, most of their crucial songs didn't even make the cut. Tragically under-represented is the MIND-BLOWING ""Over the Edge"" album, as well as the ""Youth of America"" EP. That's not to mention that ""Is This Real"" ain't even included (rights weren't held by Restless). All bitching aside, this is a taste of one of THE BEST bands of the late 70's and 80's (yah, yah, I know Sage is still around). FIND AND BUY ALL REISSUES. THEY ARE NOW AVAILABLE ON ""GIFT OF LIFE"" RECORDS."
3,Does not live up to the hype,"I had been curious about Greg Sage's work for some time. The near-unanimous critical aclaim, the high profile extollers (Cobain, etc.), the uncompromising musical ethic and semi-recluse life intrigued me. This sampler seemed a good place to start investigating Mr. Sage's creative output.Sadly, I find myself underwhelmed. Rather than criminally neglected genius, I hear rather pedestrian though competent American post-punk with little to distinguish it from dozens of similar 80s groups. The guitar playing so often referred to as bearing comparison to Hendrix struck me as proficient but hardly inspiring. The vocals are indistinct, and the lyrics are repetitive, cliche ridden and at times cring inducing (""speak to me with your soul tongue""? Sheesh.)Overall pleasant, workmanlike and inoffensive, I regret that these tracks, ostensibly among the best of Sage's first 15 years, show scant evidence of the godlike skill and intense urgency so often claimed by Wipers fans."
3,"Helpful in some ways, but in other ways, not so helpful",The College Board Book of Majors gives a thorough and clear understanding of what each major consist of. That was the only thing I found helpful. This book is bigger than it should be. You have to search and search and search for information by weeding out all the other useless words. That was discouraging to me. There are so many other College Board books so look for them before you leap into this one.
5,If I could only give it 100 stars...,Beautiful India.Arie never disappoints me... Her talent and inspirational words and voice carry her throughout both her albums. I look forward to seeing what she has coming next... This album is an absolute must-have!
5,Great from beginning to end!,"There are few CD's that I can listen to from beginning to end. Voyage To India is one of them. I LOVE this CD. Some of the songs you have to listen to more than once to get what she's really talking about, but once you do--you'll be hooked. My 7 year old son loves the CD also. Her messages hit home. This is one to buy."
2,Voyage to India,Disappointing. The songs are undistinguishable. They run into one long momotone music of the same rhytm and not much variety. I heard one song in the art galery and was atracted to it not knowing that one song is over and over through out the CD.
3,Maybe i'm missing something...,"i love india.arie and respect her work, but this album isn't touching me the way her first one did. this album is filled with a bit much of the 'ya feeling' me aspect. the production i think could have been a bit better and as far as india really bringing it to us, i'm not sure thats what the case it. i think this album was rushed. but all in all you got your grammy's right. still much love for you india."
3,New direction,"When I heard ""Video,"" I was shocked. I haven't heard this kind of good music since...well never. It really hit home, and helped me feel better about myself!When I got this cd, at first I was a little disappointed. She's not talking as much about herself, and as a result, it seems very general and less personal. but then again, we can't have her doing the exact same thing, right? I think she's trying a different take to her music.However, some of the tracks on this ""Voyage to India"" are noteworthy, such as ""Little Things.""So for those who are thinking about buying it-Do it!"
4,Growing up,"It's not _Acoustic Soul_, and it shouldn't be. Arie is growing both in the skill of her singing but in the breadth of her songwriting. It's becoming more and more clear that India.Arie is an artist that is going to be around for a long time; she's not a flash in the pan. While her first album garnered more attention since she was an unknown at the onset of its release, _Voyage to India_ is an excellent album that locks India.Arie in as an artist to be reckoned with in the coming years and hopefully decades. Here's to you, India!"
5,An awesome follow-up,"As a frequent music consumer, it is refreshing to hear India talk about positive black men, love for God, and self discovery. I mean how much Jay-Z and P. Diddy can one take before we all throw up? India celebrates life in a way that makes me proud to be a black woman. While the haters criticize India for being preachy, in this time of economic uncertainty, impending war and chaos, it is great to hear someone sing about the important things in life. I actually like 'Voyage' more than 'Acoustic Soul'. I love 'Talk to Her' 'Slow Down' and 'The One'. I think India will be a singer certain to be on the scene for awhile"
4,I love this woman,"It was not as good as her first; yet, I will buy anything buy and/or represented by this talented queen. Her music is good for the soul!"
2,It's Missing Something,"I bought this, thinking that it would be better than her first album, which I didn't like. I have to say, after multiple listens, the songs don't really stick. The production is somewhat better than her debut album, but again the album is lacking a vibe. The lyrics sometimes delve too simplistically; her voice is decent. At first review, I thought this might be a pretty good album. But after more and more listens, I'm finding that this album lacks a certain amount of emotional depth. So I guess if you liked her first album, then you'll like this album I guess. But if you didn't like her first album, then you won't be too impressed with this album either, as I apparently have come to realize. We'll have to see what comes next I guess."
4,India does it again!,"The fabulous underrated India.Arie won me over with Acoustic Soul. Happily, I report that she has done it again with Voyage to India. Soulful lyrics with a gentle guitar and a fabulous voice. This album isnt the masterpiece that is Acoustic Soul but it is a solid follow-up for a rising star. Extremely enjoyable album. Maybe now she will get the recognition she deserves!"
5,Not as good as the first...but still great.,"The first one was teeming with classic material. This one has great, high quality songs, with less classics."
3,"LOVED ACOUSTIC SOUL, BUT......","I WAS DISAPPPOINTED WITH THIS CD - I EXPECTED THE SAME GREAT MUSIC THAT WAS ON ACOUSTIC SOUL. ALTHOUGH VOYAGE TO INDIA ISN'T A BAD CD, IF YOU CAN BURN A COPY INSTEAD OF BUYING IT, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT. UNFORTUNATELY THIS CD JUST DOESN'T GRAB YOU THE WAY ACOUSTIC SOUL DID."
2,We've been let down,"I have a copy of India's Acoustic Soul CD and it is wonderful. That entire CD is good, which is why I found this album so disappointing. It just doesn't seem to pop like the first. It's just a bunch of muttering/moaning that doesn't grap the listener's attention. It doesn't say 'Hey, listen to what I have to say'. The best song I found was the bonus track 'Interested'. Now that song grabs me ... the rest is just back noise."
3,Overrated - It's Been Done Before,"I first heard this CD at a friend's house. She raved about it and listening to it as backround music I liked, it so I bought it. Most of it represents the same music you have heard before - like deja vu all over again. There is no new musical ground broken here. The lyrics are different, but played to the same music. I doubt there are many who are going to buy this CD for the lyrics. I've tried to listen to this CD over and over, but I cannot avoid the skip button. This really is more of a trip to boredom and ennui."
2,What Happened???,"This album is not even close to Acoustic Soul. It had a few decent moments scattered throughout which earns it 2 Stars but you can tell she rushed this one for the Grammy Deadline, it sounds half-assed.""Acoustic Soul"" was one of the best albums of 2001. I personally think ""Voyage to India"" is a waste of money. Hey, everyone has their own opinion. I just hope she takes her time on the next one."
2,OVERRATED!,"I respect and applaud her lyrics and style but please come clean, she can't sing! Everyone rips Ashanti for her vocals but because India has braids and does the earthy thing with limited vocal range we claim she raised the bar?! Don't buy the hype, look to Jill Scott and Heather Headley!"
5,Definitely a voyage...,"I really feeling India.Arie's new album! It's really nice, soothing and it's great to listen to. India's a really nice person, every time I run into her in Atlanta, she's really sweet. It's good to know that there are still good artists out that are good people and make good music."
5,voyage to india a must have,if you're tired of the same old r&b [stuff] on the radio this is for you india's on another level thank you stevie wonder for bringing us this talented sister shine on.
5,Hey I liked it,"I really like this album because it is melodic and fun . Even though Acoustic Soul lyrically may have been better, I enjoy this one better. Grant it there is no ""Video"" or ""Strength, Courage and Wisdom"" on this album, I am feeling the vibe, nonetheless. This album has a more slick R&B vibe. A nice album to listen to on a road trip."
2,I feel like a sinner,"A friend of mine has been trying to get me to review CDs for a while and I've resisted, but I couldn't resist any longer with this release. I really liked ""Acoustic Soul."" It wasn't my favorite of all time, but it was good. With ""Voyage"" I just feel like a dirty sinner. Well, maybe that's too extreme. Just as another reviewer said, I feel the CD is too preachy. It just feels like Dr. Phil, Iyanla and Anthony Robbins rolled into one with musical accompaniment. I enjoy Jill, Erykah and Tracy more because they add a vurnerable, weak side to their music that I feel is lacking here. I like artists who convey a message that they are human beings that falter at times. I just don't feel that genuinely coming across in this release. Not even with the inclusion of the song ""Slow Down."" As another reviewer said, I like the music, but I just can't get past the lyrics. They were meant to uplift, but just manage to bash the listener over the head with faux positivity."
5,She's got my attention,"India Arie is an artist that is obviously overlooked by the music industry. This woman is fantastic. She works with some of the best musicians in the business and she is one herself. India has a buttery smooth voice and her message is positive for women, her lyrics are loving toward men. She is very introspective and spiritual. I will continue to purchase her work."
5,She's awesome!,I love all of her music! Her messages are so positive and uplifting and they help me to refocus my thoughts and to look on the brighter side!
5,its about time,"India.Arie finally got the Grammy she deserved way back when her first CD was released. Voyage to India certainly warranted the Grammy, her voice coupled with the lyrics and the awesome music production turn this CD into a masterpiece. The girl is talented and some of these other wannabe divas can not touch her with a ten-foot pole. India has got it all, hands down. She is a talented sista, she's beautiful inside and out and her spirit is refreshing.Buy both of her CDs if you want to hear good music and you want to feel good about yourself."
5,Wonderful Music and Lyrics,This is one of the few CDs that combine wonderful music with very thoughtful lyrics. I highly recommend it.
3,More when less,"At eighteen songs, India.Arie's second album has a lot of filler, including two interludes with the same backing track and an ill-advised Christmas song. But the good stuff is uplifting. Like her tour mate Sade, her music shines best when it's just her voice, beats, and acoustic guitar."
5,Powerful!,"First, and I have to say this, India.Arie was robbed at the Grammys! Having said that, Voyage to India is powerful, musically and lyrically. She has again opened up the heart, mind and spirit of this listener and lover of her MUSIC. All you have to do is listen, I mean truly listen with your heart, and you will know that this ""Minister of Music"" is a God send.She has brought back to us music with a real meaning. Something that has been missing since the 60's & 70's a time when there was a message in the music, you know, Stevie, the Commodores, Earth Wind & Fire, Marvin, and the list goes on and on.India.Arie, thank you, and please don't ever change your focus."
4,Unlocking Literacy: Effective Decoding and Spelling Instruction,Easy to read and understand. Very teacher friendly.
3,Love West Wing but why no English subtitles?,"The series continues, and Season 6 is better than Season 5, but my beef is that there are no English subtitles. I watch this while I am on the stationary bike and like to be able to catch the dialog on subtitles when the noise interferes with hearing some of the throaway lines. If I were really hard of hearing this would be a total drawback."
4,Subtitle YUCK!,"Since I was overseas for much of this season's run, I have waited patiently for it to come out on DVD. I am sure I will enjoy this season as much as I have the other seasons but I am only 5 minutes in and already under-impressed with the subtitle system. I have always enjoyed watching WW with English subtitles because the dialogue is so fast and rich that I find I miss important information if I don't have the subtext to read. I am VERY unhappy that they do not have English subtitles in this season!!!"
2,West Wing; Sixth season,"The sixth season of West Wing is well produced. But there are changes to the characters, which makes it unlike previous seasons. C.J. becomes Chief of Staff, the President developes M.S., Donna leaves her support position to Josh and Josh leaves to campaign for someone, Charlie is no longer assistant to the President and of course Sam left in an earlier season. It is not the same program in my opinion."
5,The Weathered Storm,"The West Wing failed miserably in the fifth season, which nearly became it's last. The first four were jems and possibly the most intelligent show on television. The sixth season was a marvelous side of the West Wing that had not been fully explored yet: a true campaign. We learn to love Alda and respect Jimmy Smitts more and more as each episode progresses. This season was what saved the show from a embarrassing cancellation, which came only a year later. I miss Aaron Sorkin and Tommy Schlamme, with them, it could have ran through he entire Santos stay in the White House."
2,For UK only,"I bought this ""season 6"" because it was advertised ""with English Subtitles"" but it would not even play in my machine because it is for UK only. So I sent it back."
1,shame on Warner Brothers,"I am sure that I am not alone when I say that before I purchase anything, I will research the item. Thankfully, that is what I did before considering buying The West Wing season 6 . To find that English subtitles are not included is just plain wrong. Evidently people with handicaps such as hard of hearing are of no concern to the corporate decision makers at Warner Brothers. Shame on you."
2,Disappointing,"In this season CJ is promoted to Chief of Staff. It is obvious that her unrealistic promotion (in contrast to her character from season 1) was meant to infuse new energy into the show. Every other scene is about contrasting her womanhood with being Chief of Staff. She seemed authentic in her previous role while she comes off as angry and whiny much of the time in her new one. Her character as a whole thus ceases to be appealing and convincing. The rapid dialog comes off as stale and empty. I also felt that Josh (who still wears a back-pack over his shoulder) is a role model for the show's college-aged viewers and is not exactly role model material (he is completely obsessed with politics and neglects other aspects of life). While it's an overall disappointment, Martin Sheen is AMAZING (as he always is)."
5,West wing ----- excellent,We love the West Wing series and are absolutely thrilled to have all of the seasons on dvd. It's a must have for the West Wing fan.
4,It is what it is,"Difficult to rate something so commercial and shrink wrapped. Basically, it was a good value and shipped promptly. Received in only a couple of days.Best thing is the availability and now I have the complete series."
5,Two more seasons!,"I gave up on ""The West Wing"" at the beginning of Season 5, when it seemed to enter the lame-duck duldrums precipitated by the departure of Aaron Sorkin. However, I recently got to watch the entire sixth season in the space of about a week or so, and I found it to be addictive and rewarding -- it's like watching a novel. The writing isn't quite as sharp as it was in seasons 1-4, but the plot lines and the brilliant refocusing on the upcoming presidential campaign, led by great performances by Jimmy Smits and Alan Alda, reinject the tangy, headline-echoing excitement of the glory years. Allison Janney, and Brad Whitford really shine in these episodes as excitement builds through the primaries, and Janel Moloney comes into her own as she gains independence working on a rival campaign."
2,West Wing Sixth Sub Titles,"Unlike the previous 5 season releases of West Wing and also not following the broadcasts of the Sixth Season, the current release in DVD format does NOT have English sub titles. This is most unfortunate in that some of the dialog is nearly impossible to follow 100% without sub titles. In an informal viewing, not one person was able to catch all of the dialog. One of the actors was even affectionately nick named ""Mumble Blond"" after viewing this release."
3,closed captions,"We've enjoyed this series because of the English subtitles and would rate the first five seasons with 5 stars. Now the 6th season no longer has English subtitles and we miss a lot of what is happening. The box has the closed caption symbol, but we were unable to bring up closed captions. Does anyone know how to do this? Would appreciate your help."
1,The English subtitles are gone starting with this season.,"I love the West Wing, but I guess the makers of this DVD boxed set didn't think that deaf people would want to watch past season 5. The English subtitles that were present on the first five seasons' worth of DVDs have mysteriously disappeared starting with season 6.I guess deaf people have to know French or Spanish to finish up this series. What a disappointment."
2,why are there no english subtitles?,"I have watched seasons 1 through 5 as I walk on my treadmill. The briskness of the language in this series demands use of the subtitle feature, especially over the noise of the treadmill. It is inexplicable why the first five seasons would offer English subtitles and Season 6 leave it out for the english speakers but provide it for the french and spanish. Go figure."
2,Bad DVD,"I have not had time yet to watch the entire season, but it was spoiled by the fact that on DVD #2 the DVD stuck on a scene on the first episode and the only way I could get beyond it was to stop the DVD and go to the next episode and then back into the area immediately after the area causing the problem.This has certainly soured me on purchasing something like this online."
2,West Wing Seasons 6 and 7,Just received the above but disapointed there were no English subtitles available. Just French and Spanish. Will be returning both videos!!!
3,West Wing Dud,"Well, it is the West Wing... but it's not the same show I love. After watching for countless nights in a row, we've hit a lull with this season. But Season 7 still doesn't have a release date, so I guess taking our time with this one isn't the worst thing in the world. It's fine. It's just not the show I've come to expect."
4,Another year in the White House,Not one of the best seasons but still was one of the best shows on TV. Hated to see it end.
2,Not EZ,These pieces are not the EZ version. They are not the style that have the separator the you put the wire in and then Insert the end. These are difficult to use.
1,"Poor design, worse technical support","These RJ45 plugs for Cat6 wires are constructed with a single pin that fails to consistently penetrate the solid wires in our Cat6 ethernet cables.Their technical support was even worse, the response we received when asking about teh inconsistent connections is that their testers didn't have any problems!We are presently using RJ45 plugs that have pins that wrap around the solid wires and come with excellent instructions that detail how to strip the wires, place them in the cable guide, etc.The pins I purchased from Amazon don't have any instructions, their technical support hasn't supplied any instructions.Please don't buy these ends, I don't believe they will work very well with standed wire in the ethernet cables either, the pins aren't strong enough to be stable."
1,Shipped the wrong item,Shipped CAT 5 plugs instead of CAT 6!.. $4.99 shipping for a tiny package and arrived in a week!. Wasted my time and delayed my project
1,rj45 connectors from hell,"These are by far the worst rj45 plugs ever. For years, I used to crimp cables with relative ease, and usually get them to work on the first crimp. I must have used about 20 plugs on just two new cat 6 wires, and I still couldn't get them to work. Each time I tested with my cable tester, I get faults on different wires. Upon closely examining the rj45 plug head after crimping, I notice that the metal teeth connectors are either slanted, or completely miss the wires. Save your money, and buy better rj45 plugs."
2,Cat6 Micro RJ45 Plugs/Modular,"Product came as advertised in a neat small package. Cost of shipping too high. RJ45 plugs/modulars with loadbars fit CAT6 solid cable. However, crimping did not result in a good connection. Tried numerous times but each time the Trendnet cable tester would indicate a faulty pin. It was always at a different cable pin. Finally used ten year old RJ45 plugs/modulars without inserting the loadbar and every patch cable made work perfectly. I wanted to return the RJ45 plugs/modulars but why add the cost of shipping the plugs back. A lesson learned, read the reviews of others, and learn from their mistakes. I don't blame the company but the CAT6 plugs/modulars are not reliable."
4,Tight fit for Cat6,"There are plenty of instructions online, so lack of paperwork was no problem. Definitely leave some extra wire after untwisting the pairs and make your first cut diagonal. This makes it easier to insert the individual leads into the guide block. After verifying the layout, cut the ends off flush with the end of the block then insert for crimping. It was a very tight fit for the unstripped cable to be inserted into the RJ45 plug. Be sure the conductors reach all the way into the plug before crimping."
1,Poor CAT6 ends,"The ends that I ordered were for CAT6 cabling. I needed these to complete a project in my home. The first one I tried did not work becuase the small plastic pice that keeps the pairs separated did not work as it should. I replaced the small piece and I was able to get it to work, but when the pairs were placed in the end pice and crimped, the brass pins that are supposed to penetrate the wire kept missing the wire. Good price, but poor product. I had to go elsewhere to replace the order."
4,Very good DVD,"This DVD was a good source of action. Even though it does not have multi-angles, the fact that some scenes do not include Jenna Jameson made it have good variety. Also it had a lot of things to choose from. This DVD actually shows girl-on-girl oral for the most part, but they cut out most scenes that are too pornographic."
2,cookie cutter blues,"I wish I could say something nice about this CD but, I love the blues too much to endorse this sorry effort. With all due respect to Mr. Dawkins who was very influencial in the day, this CD sounds like it was manufactured, not felt. Besides a very sterile type studio recording, what's up with that guitar tone!!? Anyone who's been playing as long as he has should know how to get a decent guitar tone and even if he's getting older and losing his hearing, why didn't the producer say something? I mean, it sounds like some kid practicing in his bed room through a cheapo Peavey amp. Even the famous and competent backing musicians couldn't save this from disaster. Sorry Jimmy, you gotta do better than this."
5,Makes picking a name alot easier!!,"If you need any help finding a name for a new furry family member, this is the book for you!!! The usual names are listed, but it's the many unusual names that keep you reading...until you find that perfect one!!!!"
2,poor study aid for the PCAT,"I bought this book along with Barrons, this book is a very poor representation of the test I took last week. I won't lie, the information needed for the test was covered, along with every other bit of information in the fields of biology and chemistry. I could have (and did) get more out of outline general chem and bio books. The practice questions are much more difficult than the standard PCAT questions. If you have all the time in the world this book would be fine, but if you are like me and are going to have to work time to study into a busy schedule save the money and invest in Barrons."
2,Preparation for PCAT,I had difficulties reading it; too much information I did not need on the actual PCAT exam...
1,Do NOT buy this book,"I wish you could give 0 stars!I took the PCAT in October 2002 & scored 99th percentile in all categories. Do not buy this book -- it will not help you! The outline goes way too in depth. For example, it suggests that you learn the names & structures of all 20 amino acids--you don't need to know stuff like that. It goes into a lot of organic chemistry you don't need. You don't need to know the taxonomy it insists you do. Peterson's and Barron's are much more representative of the type of information on the test.This book is a big waste of money. Get the other 2 & work some problems from a general chem text book. Take an anatomy course before the test."
2,Poor Preparation,"Overall, this book is a poor representation of the PCAT. The verbal, biology, and chemistry sections are much more in-depth than the actual PCAT. However, the math and reading comprehension section were useful. Explanations for answers were provided at the end of each section but not for the sample PCAT. The answer key contained some errors. Not recommended."
5,Spectacular Sales Insights: Could not put it down!,"I have been a Sales Executive in the Corporate Training & Consulting Industry for 13 years,and have a bookshelf crammed with good books on the topic of improving your skills & results.This book is ""a cut above"": especially for the seasoned professional who wants to consciously work on incremental gains. You know you win by a margin vs. a mile...the true stories, tips & tools in this ""treasure trove"" of a book provide a roadmap to winning important pieces of business."
1,Misleading ad,"When I received the ""supposedly"" high flow air filter kit, it turned out to just be the filter ONLY!!! Why put kit at the end if there is no kit, just a filter. So when I called to ask about the missing pieces to the ""kit"" they informed me that it would be almost double the price!! Basically the three bolts will cost you $24.00, let's do the math here that's $8.00 a bolt!! WOW plz fix your add so that it's not so misleading to the potential buyer, thanks."
4,"Finally I have found ""Songs from the Heart""","My mother has been looking for this album for quite a long time. And I am so happy that I have found it,because now I have a nice affordable gift to give her for Ramadan.This album is very nice, my favorite song is ""Estoy Enamorado"" which means ""I am in love"" and is sung by a married couple from Cuba. I would recommend this album:)"
4,I Bought this CD for Dancing. Realized it was a gem later,"Don't listen to the bigoted editorial about this CD. Yes some of the tracks are not exceptional but many are. Every one is excellent for dancing. And yes there is nothing really new, but if you dig deep enough absolutely nothing has been new for the last 50 years except some nearly unlistenable electronica.The music has a certain heart that I really liked"
5,CKY!!! Awesome.,"This is the best collection of moives you can get. This box set includes cky landspeed, cky2k, cky3, and cky the documentary. These movies will keep you laughing for hours. I highly recomend this box set."
5,Awesome BEYOND Belief ! !,"Ok you have heard of Jackass but have you heard of Cky? Cky started Jackass and to me is way better. This set has all Cky, Cky2k, Cky 3, and Cky: Documentary. They are all great, especially the Doc. The documentary has skits they did before Jackass and Cky. It has Jess, Bam, Brandon, Raab and all of them. Cky is the BIG deal. I reccomend this and i would give it 10 Stars but i can't. It is mostly like Jackass and if you like that get this. It is also like Jackass the movie, Uncensored. It will be like GOLD in your DVD collection. OK, BUY IT! ! ! !"
4,Good box full of smelly pranks!,"If your into the whole tasteless, mindless, ""why when I do that I always get arrested by the cops!"", type of pranks and funnies on other unsuspecting people than this is a 4 disc collection that you should take a look at. I think that these guys had the embilical chord wrapped around their neck too tight before they were born!"
5,Awsome,"if you are into skateboarding, jackass or just sick & funny stunts buy this one. it's an original and worth its' price! all 3 ckys including a funny documentary on dvd! this will blow your mind!"
5,best collection of dvds ever.,"this should get 6 stars.there is not words to describe how good these dvds are. these are the best movies u will ever see. i swear u will watch them over and over. if u like jackass buy these, if u like skateboarding buy these, if u like comedy buy these. its not just the stunts and skateboarding that are amazing, the prank calls and drive thrus in mcdonalds make me laugh every time i watch them. dont forget to pick up cky4 and jackass the movie."
4,This stuff works,"I have two female 50+lb. dogs and they always go on the same spot. I only give them one a day, and honestly, my lawn does look much better."
4,Classic punk rock,"this is about the troubles in Ireland in the 70's. It is classic punk rock. Angry, raw and full of emotion. SLF are still touring. I think it is the best punk rock ever recorded."
2,Non-flammable,"For the best of Stiff Little Fingers, skip the flat studio albums and track down a copy of _Stiff Little Fingers: The Peel Sessions_. There's no comparison."
2,CHEAP~FLIMSY!,"This doll does NOT sit up as shown in pic, its way too flimsy/floppy as head/feet/hands are heavy plastic, but arm/legs are NOT attached but rather filled with cheap stuffing! Its already thinned out after only being played with a few times.NOT worth the money.went through the batteries quickly..the voice in english/spanish works great...just too heavy/floppy for younger kids to carry around"
5,Academy Award Winner!!!,"In reference to the review below, this soundtrack WAS up for an Academy Award and won BEST ORIGINAL SCORE. Corigliano was right in prominently thanking Joshua Bell during his acceptance speech. This CD (and the movie) would just be another soundtrack lost in the racks without Bell playing as passionately as he did. Congratulations on the Oscar!!!"
5,Brilliant Variations on a Subtle Soundtrack,"As a long-standing Corigliano fan, I rushed to see ""The Red Violin"" the week it came out. I was rewarded with a moving and accessible score. Upon purchasing the CD and listening to it several times, the hidden subtleties of the thematic transformations emerged. Rarely does a soundtrack so meaningfully enhance the theme of a film: the search for the perfect union of passion and logic is inherent within the visual narrative as well as the musical progression. Perhaps the best aspect of the disk is Corigliano's variations on the film's themes in the ""Chaconne for Violin and Orchestra."" This work is vintage Corigliano, taking his ideas to their musical exhaustion by alternating poignant meditation with the pure passionate energy. If for nothing else, gut this CD for Joshua Bell's electrifying performance of this well-crafted work of art."
3,Disappointing,"I love Joshua Bell and thoroughly enjoyed Corigliano's composition in the theater. I was even glad the film score got an Oscar, but I'm sorry to say that I was surprisingly disappointed with the CD. I can only conclude that the music was really engineered for the visceral impact of the mega-speaker sound systems in Sony theaters, rather than a home stereo, unless you just like imbalanced and thunderous bass."
4,Accessible and beautiful.,"I don't understand the remarks of the reviewer below! This soundtrack is extremely accessible to anyone, and a great introduction to classical music in general. Corigliano's score is both cinematic and intimately refined. It is equally at home in the concert hall and behind the action on screen. That is an amazing thing to behold.Buy it!"
4,"Great CD, but ...","Corigliano's score is a tad repetitive. It works better when the movie's playing. It is very soothing and relaxing, and great to fall asleep to, however. I still recommend it."
5,Amazing and touching,"Out of sheer curiosity, I bought this CD soon after learning it existed. As a violist who enjoys classical music, I had been interested in Joshua Bell, but I had never heard him play, nor had I heard any of Corigilano's music. Nevertheless, ""The Red Violin"" amazed me from the start. Bell plays the eclectic, emotional music with great passion and sensitivity. As a result, the music is soothing, stirring, and simply inspiring to hear."
5,Corigliano,"Corigliano did a superb job of correlating his music with the story on the screen in The Red Violin. As soon as I walked out of the movie, I knew I had to have the music. I have enjoyed owning it, and have noticed portions of it being used by skaters in recent competitions. This CD runs the gamut of music styles, with everything from cliff-hanger suspense to the children's voices in China. The violinist (Joshua Bell) is one of the great ones."
5,Great History and Suspense,I truly enjoyed the book. I have lived in Butte MT all of my life and have heard many interesting gossip strories regarding the fires in the Uptown Disrict in the 1970's. I read the book in two evenings . I enjoyed the colorful characters and the interesting description of the Uptown Butte. I wonder if Mr. Lee is going to write another novel. I would surely be interested in knowing if and when he does.
1,Waste of my time,"What a mistake! I have read The Breach series by Patrick Lee and thought this book was the same author. I did not realize that The Fire Season was written by Patrick C. Lee... while reading this book I kept thinking how the Breach series books were excellent and the writing in this book was so poorly written, boarding on childish. I'm still not sure why I read the entire book! I'm just very glad that it was in the lending library and I didn't pay a penny for it. I will not make the same mistake again when searching for Patrick Lee!! If I could apologize to him, I would.."
4,A Look at the Ballets of the l930's and 1940's.,A look at the great ballets of the recent past with photographs of the leading dancers of the time.
3,Great for Moms,"I thought the writing was great and hilarious, but not being (or wanting to be) a mother made some of the material boring because I couldn't relate. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone, only with the caveat that much of it is focused around motherhood."
3,"Amusing, but far from hilarious","As a hardcore fan of female humor writers, I eagerly anticipated cackling with abandon over this book. Alas, it's really not that funny. Amusing, yes. Hilarious, no. I was frankly disappointed. If you want to read something that will have you guffawing out loud, have strangers stare at you in public while you snicker audibly, or keep your husband awake at night because you won't shut up laughing at the book, try Laurie Notaro or Jen Lancaster. I practically hee-hawed myself silly over Lancaster's ""Bitter is the New Black"" and Notaro's ""Autobiography of a Fat Bride."""
5,Boring? Whatt???? Try freakin' hilarious!!,"Susan Reinhardt is about as boring as your first french kiss or the first time you jump out of a plane! Every woman will totally relate to this book. Susan Reinhardt is like a funnier, naughtier version of your best girlfriend.Her writing is one-part sassy southern gal, two-parts lovin' mommy and three-parts gal-pal gossip. She says what we've all either thought about, experienced or watched from afar. I mean, really what woman hasn't wanted her husband's libido to go on vacation for a while? And who hasn't shed a quiet tear over the fall of her once perky breasts?I heard Susan speak at the Erma Bombeck Humor Writers Conference, and she was the funniest woman there. Her tales about her double virgin sister who lives in Rich City and the wacky citizens she encounters as a newspaper columnist had us in tears."
2,The Title is The Best Part of this Book,"Maybe I've just become more accustomed to Laurie Notaro's snarky wit and humor, but I found this book incredibly boring and not very funny. Even though the majority of the essays are focused around motherhood (and I'm not a mother), the writing was soft and a little too sweet. My tastes tend towards witty and sarcastic, and I didn't find that in this book, though I expected to based on its title. Definitely too cutesy for my tastes."
5,My jaw hurts.,"Susan Reinhardt rocks. While being raised in a New England influence and then serving an entire adult career in law enforcement in the American Southwest was all great... I still feel a bit cheated that I wasn't at some point a son of the South. The best part would be having some sassy but demure, wicked but proper, and alway bone-cracking funny woman in your life. But that's okay, I don't think my heart could take that."
1,I agree....BORING!,I bought this because it came up on a search for Laurie Notaro. Save your money and buy a Laurie Notaro book...she is actually funny!
5,Never Wanted It to End!,"This book is such a scream but quite poignant at the same time. I felt like I was lying on my bed with my best friend having a heart-to-heart. Once I started reading it, I quite simply could not put it down. When I finished it - sadly - within 24 hours, I felt like a member of Susan's inner circle. What an absolute riot but so searingly honest. Move over, David Sedaris, I know what my girlfriends will be getting for their birthdays this year!!"
2,Boring,Slow moving and boring. The sample was funny so I thought it would be a really good laugh. It was not.
1,Not what was expected,"purchased as a gift, but it was not what was expected. It appears that its almost a help book, to understand yourself and be prepared for ""tonight"" but it turns out it was just a series of short stories"
2,"I tried...I really, really tried.","I loved the title, I loved the description, I loved the reviews but I just could NOT finish this book. I was not funny, it was not interesting it was a collection of random stories from a very ego driven mom. I gave up 1/2 way through."
1,Wish I had the 3 hours of my life back,"...that I wasted reading this book! I hope the author uses the money for marriage counseling! If you are a man hater or just generally are one of those nit picky women who no one will ever live up to YOU this book is for you. I swear I tried to finish it, but the author's vulgarness and constant complaining about her husband did me in!"
1,Full of Herself and Boring,"I wish I could find as much humor in this book as apparently many others have. I found this writer to be incredibly full of herself and, unless you count deriding others who have had the great misfortune of not being Ms. Reinhardt as amusing, particularly not funny. Unless you are also a Southern Belle who thinks she's the cutest little trick in shoeleather this book is probably not for you."
1,Could not even finish it.,I found this book to be very boring. I read a few chapters and gave up. It just didn't hold my interest. I don't know how it has a 4 star rating.
2,Not that funny,"I thought this would be hilarious, maybe along the lines of a Celia Rivenbark; but it really wasn't that funny. In fact, at times, it could be downright boring and being southern, nobody I know uses the P word with such abandon, especially grandmothers. I wouldn't buy it but would check it out of the library."
1,Dumb....,"This book was actually pretty annoying. I was 2 chapters into it and just got so annoyed at how hard she was trying to be funny that i was ready to put the book down. It was a lot of rambling and run-on sentences so i ended up skipping quite a few chapters. She had one chapter called ""The Perfect Mom"" which she literally went on for 3 pages about this ""Perfect Moms"" quality's that she didn't like. That's when i gave up. I really think i was hoping for it to be a lot like Chelsea Handlers books since it was listed under recommended reading if you liked her, so that could be why i was so disappointed. Her books are hilarious and i recommend checking her out. I'm just really glad i got this from the library instead of buying."
2,Not so much!,The book was boring and really not that funny! I ended up tossing it in the garbage at the Atlanta airport when I realized my carry on was too bulky and began getting rid of nonessentials...which I consider this book to be. Never got past the first three chapters. Don't bother to order or read!
2,"Not Tonight Susan, I Have Better Things to Read","With the jacket boasting a Sweet Potato Queen/Fanny Flagg comparison, I was expecting cute/sassy. Or fresh/brassy. Or even cheeky/bold, but I found this book to be, as promised, just crass/raunchy--and not in a good way. Writing good humor isn't easy-- offering this particular crassness instead of real storytelling doesn't cut it with me. (I kept thinking a middle-aged Britney Spears.) As for the essays themselves-- Zoloft in her husband's tea, the irritable uterus syndrome, buying a nursing dog in a parking lot -- these aren't funny, they're just kind of gross. Lacking talent and wit, she slides to the lowest common denominator: vulgarity."
5,mouse on mars never stop amazing me,"this album is incredible. their last release, radical connector, coinsides with this release well. the hooks, and riffs only reveal themselves after many plays, and it is imperative to listen to the entire album atleast a few times. this album has no lyrics, and their drummer is not present in this album. it is pure electronic, and it is very catchy. they keep their base and go crazy with the sound.this release was everything i expected and more.buy this album if you want one of the best releases of 2006."
5,Great tool.,Great for greasing farm equipment or as preventative maintenance. Use with Lincoln Lubrication 1134 Heavy Duty Pistol Grip Grease Gun.
3,"A Fair product, not worth the price","I would not recommend this product, there were several faults I noticed soon after recieving it, The power button seems to be too short, and gets stuck in the off position unless the button is removed and the prong is pressed. Also, if the unit is turned upside down will a dvd is in, the dvd will fall off the spindle and the unit will need to be opened to remove it.Although everything else is good with this unit.I have found a similar product, (the same brand)for the same price that is much better. The unit is much more solid and more stylish. So I'd say that the 727 Coby Unit is a dud."
5,RECEIVED AN ERROR MESSAGE WHEN I TRIED TO HEAR MUSIC,"Sounds like a great CD but due to ""network problems' was unable to listen to samples."
5,Wonderful,"I love this book. I was lent a copy to read recently by a friend of my father, and enjoyed it so much that I bought my own copy. Beverly is a great writer. Her book is a wonderful and entertaining collection of traditional stories, photos, and even survival tips and recipes. I love her own personal stories and introductions, too."
2,"NOT A BOOK, A FEW CHAPTERS","What a disappointment to be in the middle of a story and suddenly the book just ends! Unbelievable. Was it the publisher's decision to split a fantasy novel into a ""trilogy""? I can't believe an author would actually consider this 205 pages a standalone or even a piece of a trilogy. It was nothing more than a few chapters building a story. Very disappointing."
3,Read the whole trilogy at once,"A slender volume of an intended trilogy which reads quickly and well. The subject matter, a young apprentice herbalist sent to India to trade for rare herbs and medicaments in the era of the Inquisition, is fascinating. The book is a little too short, and it is obvious within the first 50 pages that we are being set up for future volumes, which did not inspire me to read on. However, read on I did, and I quite enjoyed the blend of historical fiction and fantastical magic. I would advise waiting for the trilogy to be finished and then reading it all together in one go."
3,Reagans In YES! Get out of my yard? NO!!,"Reagans in was a classic, punk rock record. I can't reccomend it enough for you fans of the old school LA punk. The second record, Get Out Of My Yard only has one good song which is about lesbian nuns. That one was funny. Other than that, like another reviewer says, they changed singers and the newer guy sings with a lisp. I don't mean to sound harsh, but singers should not have speech impediments....at least this one should not.... Reagans In saves this CD"
2,Too soft,"This brush is sturdy and of good quality however, it is too soft to comb even my daughters dolly's hair! I avoided purchasing other brushes that indicated soft bristles however the 'reinforced' boar bristle made me think this one was firmer."
3,So-so,"It has a couple good songs. But they try too hard to give it their own twist and sound and they just can't pull it off. Hey Santa is a great song though, and their version of Let it Snow is cute. Other than that, I would give a mediocre review."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this album because I like Wilson Phillips. This album is very blah and I could have saved my money by just downloading ""Hey Santa"" instead of purchasing the whole album."
3,Christmas music,Carney and Wendy Wilson have a beautiful blend of voices therefore creating great harmony. What better way to display this harmony but in Christmas music. Well done.
5,Does the Job,"BHI - Traumeel Ointment, 3.53 oz lotionWonderful product for any soft tissue damage, recommended by my chiropractor"
5,Best cream for temporary relief,"This stuff really works. I badly smashed my finger, it immediately started swelling, bruising, hurting, etc. I used ice a couple of times and the ointment a couple of times and by morning 95% of the bruising was gone and it was just a little stiff.Also, if you have, for example, a sore back, do as it says. Three times, at least, a day and what a relief. Last, but not least, it doesn't have any odor like ben gay etc.."
3,Not real stable,"When you put bikes in, it slides shut - it does not stay open. I had to put wood in between the bottom legs to keep them from collapsing in order to get it to work."
3,Pretty Good But Not the Best,"Not a bad choice. Thought all of the music is creepy sounding it's pretty good. The ""Don Juan Triumphant"" played on the violin is absoutely beautiful and ""The Jewel Song"" taken from the opera ""Faust"" is sung quite well. There were other songs that I din't really care for but all-in-all I think it's worth the money it costs."
5,worth it,this version is better than the us release its worth 55 dollars just for armpit and let it go
1,Received the wrong book,Amazon never sent me the book ordered. Twice they sent me the bulletin or a summary.. Still waiting to receive the book...
5,Excellent explanations of this important concept,"This is an excellent book that covers a lot of ground in improving a player's bidding. Though the concept is normally used by expert players, Klinger's book is good at helping an intermediate player (like myself) understand these ideas"
2,A disappointment,"I read other reviews claiming that this publication was too brief and not worth the money. I chose to purchase it anyway, hoping that the losing trick count techniques would be updated to conform with current conventions rather than those of 1986. This publication is too brief and the print far too small to be enjoyed. It is not worth the time and postage to return it to Amazon."
5,On Modern Losing Trick Count,"Beyond the counting of high value cards, this is a quick and easy way to further assess the value of your and your partner's hand while in the midst of the bidding process."
5,Berlioz en colores,"Corrijo mi crítica anterior, después de una segunda audición del disco quede totalmente satisfecho con la interpretación de Klemperer. ES BERLIOZ EN COLORES!"
2,Humpty-dumpty a la fantastique,"Unless someone's a Klemperer completist, I can't imagine why anyone would want this Fantastique. It's an odd old schnitzel: the screwy tempi, the Teutonic cast of the orchestra, the somewhat movie soundtrack result are the only things that make half-sense of the Humperdinck as a coupling.For that's all we get: a Hummel-gothic children's story that makes for thigh-slapping hoak. Outside the German repertoire, Klemperer would make real sense in Slavic music, modern and contermporary music, but French music left him pretty much defenseless and we wonder if there is any rationale for perpetuating something like this.For the Fantastique: your best bets are Paray (extraoridinary), Munch, Argenta, Markevitch, Martinon. For the Humperdinck, keep it at a filler level and take your pick or chances, whichever."
2,My Favorite Classical music,"I play keyboard,Cello,Contra-bass and Drums. I love classical music very much.And Fusion,Jass, too."
3,Very different from what's out there....,"NBA Live 2003 is the best arcade basketball game out there. Here's a rundown of the pros and cons:Pros:The most fluid game available. Passes are crisp and dunks are nice.Players look very realistic, moreso than anything else to date.Camera angle choices are impressive.Cons:Read my first line. It's the best arcade game I've ever played. Regardless of what you've read, don't look here for a simulation.Not enough differentiation between players. Everybody can do the dunks that only a select few players will ever dream of doing in an NBA game. Same goes for player movement speed.Summary:When thinking about this game, just picture NBA Live 95 with 10x the graphics. I enjoyed playing this game thoroughly, but it just becomes too repetitive to play an 82-game season with (i.e, to buy)."
2,"Fun arcade game, but very weak overall","If you want a simple arcade basketball game, you'll be happy with NBA Live 2003. However, serious gamers should avoid this game like the plague. The serious negatives include:1.There is no way to play D. Occasionaly you can take a charge, but blocking a drive to the hoop is way too hard, stopping a drive is near impossible.2. Fast Breaks are available on every play. Again this is totally unrealistic3. Your players never get tired. No need to sub.4. In Franchise mode, even if you win, your players always want out. I've played multiple sims with a variety of teams and keeping your stars (or attracting new ones) is very difficult.Overall, this game is so unrealistic I'd avoid even renting the thing. If you want just a fast-break, coast to coast, arcade game though, you'll be satisfied."
4,good game but,"nba live 2003 is a good game but i think it is too easy to score and penetrate of isolations, etc. Also, the dunking is a little unrealistic. But the thing that i like the most about it is the music. Fat Joe, Lyric, Snoop, and Freeway are sweet hip-artists that get you into the game. The graphic detail is solid but stadium detail is lackluster and the old ""generic"" one is used over again. My rating is an 8"
4,is this game good or what?,"let me tell u something,I've played the 2k series and the live series.And the live series is better period.2k has really been gettin worse these years.everything has impoved in NBAlive exept the rosters. This game doesnt even have Yao Ming. Some superstars are on the wrong teams. EXAMPLE: JERRY STACKHOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE WIZARDS! but that could easily be fixed.Everyhing else is GREAT!"
4,An emotional experience.,"I've never written a review before today, but my pleasure with this game made me want to share the good news with everyone - NBA Live is back.For a lil' while, Live has been resting on laurels. But as of this release, the whole category has been shaken up. The introduction of Freestyle control (on the right analog stick) has certainly added to the gameplay and fun.The defensive AI is tons better and it's a pretty fast game now. Also, the music in the game is great. Snoop, Fabolous and Mr Sunshine himself - Busta Rhymes.As someone who likes straight sports gaming, I gotta say that this is a long awaited return to goodness and also greatness. The wait was worth it."
2,WILL SOMEBODDY PLEASE PLAY SOME DEFENSE.......,"2 Words.....DEFENSE PLEASE. Man I thought I liked this game when I first started to play it, but once I got the hang of it, then it sucked. They don't play any type of defense, whether your playing the computer or a human opponent. 3 pointers are too easy to make, it's just run and gun all game long and to me that is not Basketball. I prefer sports games to be more strategy oriented and if you do also, then this is not the game for you."
2,this game sucks vs. computer,i have it for the computer not ps2 but it sucks if you play against the computer.the gameplay vs. computer basically goes like this...you either block there shot or it going in.not real at all.you could block 20 shots with one player in this game on a good night.you could block 10 every game.the point guard from there team could be rated low and dominate a game.this game is garbage but the only reason i gave it 2 stars is cuz it has good moves and realistic looking moves.
3,NBA Live 2003,"I was disappointed that the rosters weren't current. No Yao Ming and Stackhouse is still with Detroit. The game has many flaws. First, when you block a shot your player will often touch the ball as it goes out of bounds. Occasionally when inbounding the ball the player you pass to is standing out of bounds and you turn the ball over. You can also be going for a dunk and the computer will bump you and steal the ball; also, you frequently get knocked down after shots and no foul is called. Alley oops occasionally go right through the glass backboard. You are not able to sign legends to multi year contracts in franchise mode. These are just some of the many flaws and I hope next season's game is greatly improved. If I had rented this first then I would not have spent the money to buy it."
5,As good as it gets,"All of the old has been good, except for the graphic's and now all the new systems have reorganised the controls and graphics its even better.I look forward to the new games from the live,co. and wonder what they might come up with next..."
3,Realistic? I don't think so.,"There is no way that this game is realistic! Players don't run up and down the floor for the full game like they do in Live! Haven't the guys at EA ever heard of fatigue? Whoever says that this game is realistic or moves at the actual NBA speed have no clue about basketball, obviously. There are simply too many fast breaks in this game. Look up any actual NBA game from last nightYou will see that hardly any team has more than 10-15. If you are going to be playing a full season on franchise mode, you'll be dying for a slower pace. This is a good party game, though. Free style control is highly over rated, but still pretty cool. But, if you want an actual simulation of real NBA basketball, get NBA 2K3. If you want an un-realistic inferior NBA game, go ahead and get LIve 2003."
3,Where is D?,"I like scoring 200- 225 PPG but it is boring after some time.It has great graphic and music but it isint realistic at all!If you want very easy baskteball game buy it, if you want something harder more realistic don buy it."
1,This game [is bad],"this game totaly is no good at all.the d is terrible,cross someone out and u got passed the d,the graphics is ok, but 2K3 makes it look better.live u cant play in the rain and fog,like 2K3.this game is just good at advertising,dont waste money on that game if u want the best basketball game get NBA2K3. Enjoy"
1,Good Game! Control Sucks!,I will admit this is a pretty realistic game! But if its impossible to control your players it doesn't make the game any fun! Freestyle and analog stinks!
2,helllllllll naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,you're selling nba live 2003 for 46 dollars nobody on planet earth will buy it for 10 dollars its an old game give it an old price
4,"Great Game, But a Few Flaws","I have always loved EA Sports. In fact, I don't think I've ever even bought another brand of sport games. Although this game is a high step above NBA Live 2002, it does have some major let downs. After the horrendous commentary on Live 2002, I expected this year's to be better. However, it is exactly the same: the commentators repeat themselves again and again. If you shoot a buzzer-beater from half-court, there is no enthusiasm at all. The commentator will just say, ""McGrady drains the 3!"" Also, there is no in-between level. After you have played the game a few times, it is only too easy to beat the rookie and starter levels. Pro will challege the adequate gamer, but anyone seriously into basketball will be able to beat it eventually. All-Star, the hardest level, is virtually impossible. I played out a season and won only three games."
3,Realistic? I think not.,"While this game is fun for playing with all your pals, it gets really boring playing against the CPU. If you're going to be playing a full season on franchise, you're going to beg for slower gameplay. This game is very un-realistic. Players can run as hard as they do in Live for a full game! Whoever says that this game is realistic or plays at the actual speed of the NBA don't know what they are talking about. If you want an actual simulation of real basketball, get NBA 2K3. If not, go ahead and get this one."
2,Sega's Got My Vote,"This game is a HUGE disappointment. I will be the first to admit that I am more of a ""sim"" player than an ""arcade"" player, which made if impossiple to enjoy this game. The new right analog controls make it incredibly easy to go right to the basket, and I would compare this game to the ""NBA JAM"" of the past. If you're looking for a true-to-life NBA sim, looks like you'll have to cross over to Sega's NBA 2K3."
2,NBA 2K3 is a lot better,NBA Live 2003 is the worst NBA game EA Sports has made. I don't like the freestyle mode at all. They have Shaq crossing over on Iverson and Alonzo Mourning swishing threes from half court. The Franchise mode is not deep enough. The salary you get isn't enough. The only thing that NBA Live and 2K3 have in common is that there is no YAO!!!!
4,Chopsticks is Fascinating,"I really enjoyed the way Du laid out the information. I thought she was very objective, which is key for an ethnography. I really think this changed my view on an equal gendered society."
3,Chopsticks only work in Pairs,"Great book, very technical not really an ethnography with a story. I love the fact that it truly discusses the egalitarian lifestyles of the Lahu."
5,Smart Women Think Ahead,"This is one of the most inspiring books I've read in a long time. For those of us in our 50s and 60s, there's more ahead than retirement and taking care of aging parents, aging men, and growing grandchildren. Levine gives us stories of regular women who have tackled brand new careers, learned skills they always wanted to learn but never had time for, renegotiated their marriages and renewed their love-lives. And she also gives us scientific research that shows women's brains have a growth spurt in the 50s that renews our strength and our intellectual curiosity. Keep this book by your bedside and read it every night and your morning will be brighter."
2,Disappointing ...,"I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing. The book was interesting enough but not very useful. I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle."
2,Inventing the Rest of Our Lives: Women in Second Adulthood,"After anticipating the arrival of this book (that I ordered some time before publication after hearing of it), I was disappointed. Although the subject is timely, the writing style smacks of academia and therefore, will not appeal to the mainstream (reader). Because I'm tenacious by nature, I finished the book, but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention. Too bad - it could have been inspirational!"
3,Wasn't too impressed.,"I thought I would try this item instead of a normal brass Hoppe's brush and here's my results. The brush was very tight even with the Hoppe's fluid on it, it was very tough to push through a S&W m&p 15-22 bore. I planned on using this on a .223 chrome lined bore but will not attempt it because it was so tight. It did seem to clean fine and probably was a little quicker vs. the standard brass brush. Overall I wasn't too impressed and will stick with the normal and cheaper brass brushes from Hoppe's."
5,Works Like A Charm!,"When I first got this, I almost sent it back thinking they sent the wrong item. It was so small upon further investigation it was indeed a small (timy) 22 cal tornado brush. I tried it out in my Ruger SR22 after using about 400 reloads and this little guy worked like a charm and held up for future use.I highly recommend the 22 cal tornado brush!Vidimo Se!"
1,No wonder this movie was in the charity shop,"I like Leslie Nielson. His parts in the series of movies ""The Naked Gun"" were very good, and his part in ""Airplane"" was also good, but not as. This on the other hand is a load of cobblers. Leslie tries to play a con man golfer, and gets himself into a bet with a professional golfer. He wins by applying every possible method of distraction to the other golfer, including Clowns and a Mongoose.If you really want to watch this, try not to spend too much money getting it."
3,WRONG MIXER FOR SERIOUS COOKS,"This is a fine machine for many things, but for serious kneading, i.e. breads, and convenience of use, the Magic Mill by Electrolux of Sweden is a much much better machine. The Magic Mill is the compromise to a professional Hobart. You can find them on the web and [they are] worth every penny. Post sale service is subperb. I use this for light duty stuff, and the pasta rolling attachment is a bargain. Do yourself a favor and get a Magic Mill."
3,too big,"I am sure this mixer is great for those who make large quantities, but just for a normal recipe (say, one batch of cookies) it really is too big. The batter clings to the beater in a big ball and doesn't mix, I have to always stop it and scrape the contents back into the bowl to continue mixing. But it did make very nice mashed potatoes."
3,Expensive choice,"Overal, most professional chefs use KitchenAid Professional 6 Quart Stand Mixer. But they are huge for a small kitchen, expensive and hard to maintain. But, sadly, I love the color red. Hopefully, there are some small mixters including hand held mixters made right here in the good ole USA with lots of colors to chose from!"
1,Save Your Money,"What a piece of crap! Save your money and get a $20 hand mixer -- you'll be better served by the results, the cost, and the clean-up."
5,"HAD IT THEN, WISH I HAD IT NOW","I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IN THE LATE 1970'S AND LOVED IT SO MUCH, I WORE OUT ABOUT THREE VINYL COPIES. IT'S STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALLTIME ALBUMS, WITH SOME GREAT BACK UP SUPPORT BY SOME OF MY FAVORITE MUSICIANS, LIKE FLORA PURIM, AIRTO, JOHNNY GUITAR WATSON,BYRON WHITE, AND LOTS OF OTHERS. GET IT IF YOU CAN FIND ONE."
4,Prefer Kissin,"Okay, I'm not adept at the classical music critic's ""lingo"" and so can't and won't go on about all the technical aspects of Argergich's performance. Certainly her virtuosity and speed in some passages was impressive, but missing from much of the performance for me was a sense of musicality. I did not feel moved by her performance as I did with Kissin. For those who want a performance that conveys more feeling and emotion, go with Kissin's performance. If you want speed and flash, get this one."
5,electrifying Rachmaninov,"The concerto performance provides what every listener can possibly hope for. Splendidly idiomatic playing. The feeling after one has been listening to this version is such that most others sounded laboured ! The suite too is well played, although some listeners may consider some of the speed too fast. The recording is faultless."
2,Get Kissin's.,"Anyone who can perform this piece at such a high level in front of thousands is impressive to me, but on a relative scale, it's not even close to Evgeny Kissin's performance. Much of the tempi are simply way too fast for any of Rachmaninoff's articulate and detail-oriented composing to be appreciated. Argerich's level of intensity is great and the high speed can be exciting, but from someone who generally performs things too fast, myself, this is too fast. Kissin's, on the other hand, isn't too slow--there are many passages that I could only dream of being able to perform as fast as him. His tempi are slow enough so that the listener can take in all of the nuances, colors, rhythms, and anything else that might be overlooked with the faster Argerich tempo. If you appreciate controlled performing (without sacrificing excitement), Argerich simply doesn't match up to Kissin."
5,This product rocks!,I asked for this microplane for Christmas and I absolutely LOVE it. I cook a lot and would cringe when a recipe called for lemon zest but now zesting is so fast and easy with this product. Works great with fresh ginger too. I'm definitely hooked!
5,"Like Wood, Like Chocolate","What a great (or grate) idea - take a precision woodworking tool, put a kitchen-friendly handle on it and you've got the best culinary hand tool in a decade! The Microplane graters are absolutely the most wonderful gadgets....easy to work with, easy to clean and good for so many tasks. And the idea of two graters and one handle is terrific! Bravo!!"
5,Fantastic Product--Amazon please offer other blades direct,"I love these graters. They are not overrated by other reviewers. I have used them to zest lemons, grate garlic, ginger and parmesan cheese. Everyone who loves these graters should e-mail amazon.com and ask them to offer the fine ribbon, medium ribbon and other interchangeable blades directly in addition to offering them from partners with high shipping costs."
2,Even the trim doesn't fix it,I am quite unhappy with this product as even after months of tweaking the rudder and trim I still can't get this Microplane interchangable grater system to operate and 100% efficientcy. I have sent it back for an exchange and got a fish slicer thrown in for free. now THAT'S a good deal
5,Sounds great - keeps the iPod dry,"I did a lot of searching for similar products before settling on this one.It's a lot bigger and heavier than I had imaged, but it works great. It has good sound, and I love being able to jump forward and back through a playlist while in the shower.My iPod stays dry.Also, it's plenty loud enough. Put the iPod volume on the loudest setting then use the volume controls on the speaker. Using it that way, I have the speaker volume at probably halfway up."
4,Great Product,I use it everyday during my shower. I definitely feel safe that the iPod's that I plug are safe and the sound is definitely good. It would have been nicer if I could use exactly the same functions as in the iPod (you can't use the shuffle play for example).But I'm happy with this product.
2,It was good...until it wasn't,"I got this for Christmas last year and really loved it in the beginning. However I noticed that if I played it too loud it almost shorted out and the sound would go away until I lowered it a bit. I don't know if I blew the speakers or not but it would definitely have that scratchy sound like a bad speaker. I primarily used it in the shower and although it's supposedly water resistant apparently it couldn't stand up to my showering because it eventually lost all sound quality. It's now very very scratchy sounding and it completely shorts out if the sound is too loud or too much bass is present, it goes to complete static. I'm not sure if it got too much water exposure, was defective, or if I just broke it but bottom line I'm getting a different one."
1,THIS IS JUNK!,"This is a peice of junk and a waste of money!! First of all, it works itermittently, with the Nano and the 60GB IPODs, if you barely move it, it loses it's connection and won't work at all. Secondly, the function control buttons don't all work!! The volume up and down work, but not the pause, ffwd, rewind and stop, they don't work! I also have purchased two of these just to make sure one wasn't manufacturer defective; they both work and don't work the exact same. JUNK!I will be returning these for a refund! Do alittle more research then I did."
4,Waterproof speaker - good,"Got it for my sister, she seems to really like it. Said it works well in the shower and the batteries last fiarly long."
1,Product is not advertised as it says..,"First off the sound quality is not that good. Secondly, if you get a drop of water in the speaker holes the sound gets distorted so bad its useless. I took this with me to vacation in St. John and I got a little bit of sand in the speaker holes. Since then the speakers sounded all distorted. Once I got the sand out it got better, but when I got home and hung the iH20W in my shower and it got drops of water in the speaker holes the sound is so bad its useless. They make this product seem like its great around water and at the beach, but if you get anything in the speaker holes its useless. This product is basically a cheap piece of $h!#."
5,Tub Tunes,"I ordered my ""iHome iH2OW Shower to Beach Portable Speaker System for iPod"" so I could safely listen to music while I take a shower or bath. Not only do I get to rock out to my fav tunes while cleaning up and putting on make-up, but I recently preformed in a show & I used my iHome to rock out in the dressing room while getting ready for the show.The iHome Shower to Beach is travel durable and has a great sound and volume system. I love it!!!"
4,awesome tunes while showering!,"I purchased this for my son who loves music. He is very happy with it, it works easily and well. He says of course it doesn't have the best sound but for the shower is it awesome. He has even figured out how to watch a movie on his ipod in the shower!!! What more can you ask for?"
1,Toxic Stories,"I could get less than half way through the book. The stories were uniformly depressing, and in some cases felt toxic, with violence, cruelty and insanity. Maybe later in the book they got better, but I just couldn't go that far. The good news is that she is an excellent writer, with fine descriptive power, but the subject matter never varied from depressing. Read this book if you want to have a real ""downer"", done with style."
4,Beautiful strangness,"I bought this book having previously read, ""Where are you going, Where have you Been? And more recently *BD*11 1 87 in the Atlantic, which blew me away. So I bought High Lonesome for further thrills and I am not disappointed. I really enjoyed ""The Lady with the Pet Dog"" This story had such subtle genius that it wheedled into my subconscious and I had to finish it by the second sitting.""Fat Man My Love"" is a grim and starkly original tale that takes courage to get through but it's worth it. In fact all of Oats' tales are a little risky because each character exposes our own weaknesses so well.I did not give it a fifth star because the physical characteristics of the book, paper, cover, and the texture seems pulpy, cheap and prone to yellowing.Other than that, an outstanding product."
2,If you like a hot bath don't waste your money,"I was really excited when I received this as a Christmas gift. What a disappointment! I like a hot bath...because this mat blows room temperature air it feels like cool water shooting up, plus it cools your bathwater down to lukewarm in nothing flat. The jets are nice, but if you are really interested in this product I would spend the extra $$ and either get a heated one, or one that hangs on the side of the tub."
4,POWERFUL...But Not Thermal!!!,"If you can't afford a real spa, like me, then this is a fine alternate. If you get the tub surface wet before sticking the mat down, the suction cups will firmly hold the mat in place. I was surprized how powerful the bubbles were. They almost felt like the jets in a big hot tub. The only thing is that this spa is not thermal. Even on the box it said THERMAL in bold, red letters. It's not that big of a problem, though. It's ok if you use soaps and shampoos. You only have to use a little bit of bath gel because the rapid movement of the water makes many soapy bubbles. My daughter dumped the normal amount she uses into the tub and a few minutes later it was overflowing with suds! I didn't believe she only added a little bit. She thought it was funny until I made her clean it up! It's a wonderful spa overall."
2,Winter Wonderland,"At first I was thrilled when my husband got me this for Christmas...he knows how much I like my baths! When I first turned it on I was quite pleased. The jets are very powerful and felt wonderful! However, I soon realized that the air being forced out felt colder and colder until it was really quite uncomfortable.Also, the mat kind of ""floats up"" in spite of the suction cups and sticks against my skin in a way that I find annoying, especially considering that the surface feels cold due to the air being shot at you.Altogether I am disappointed and sad that my present turned out this way. My husband is very disappointed too."
2,i dont like this. like the other bath mat better,conair made another bath mat whcih is better. this one slips and slides. the otehr one for over $100 stays put and relaxes back and legs.
2,not that satisfied,"come on now.... you guys know that this thing wont stick... the sution cups really are uselsess makes you wanna buy or try something else. I tried tape would not work, dont recommend this for most households becasue i live in a recently new home and its notcompatible with my tub."
3,conair bath spa,"A very good product for short money. I would recommend this product to my family and friends, without a doubt."
1,Terrible Item,I bought the bath spa for my wife not only does it sound like a vaccum cleaner running but the mat WILL NOT stay in the tub as soon as you turn it on the mat floats to the top this is not a very good item at all i would not reccomend it for any one
2,A little loud for a 'relaxation spa' simulation,"I bought this hoping it might take the place (marginally) of jets in our garden tub. It certainly is powerful and generates lots of activity in the water, but the air is a bit chilly and the pump itself is loud. I blame myself for not thinking enough about the noise level prior to the purchase (in hind site, it seems obvious). In any case, the kids get a kick out of it, so its getting used plenty!"
3,Kirk versus aliens and mind control.,"Each mini series of Star Trek novels needs its action, romance, and dark mind control novels.Dillard applies her insight into the demented mind to the Lost Years saga. If you like her other books, you will probably like this one."
3,"Some good stuff, but nothing new","If you subscribe to the Mother Earth News, Countryside Magazine, or Backwoods Home -- don't bother buying this book. If you've read your magazines, you know all this stuff already.Otherwise, it is a great compilation of material that a beginner might not know. It's a heavy read, but great if you have a pressing interest in the subject material. It's heavy on the ""getting there"" and lighter on the ""when you've gotten there"" info. I've read better books on the subject -- but I've read worse, too."
3,"Living on Less: An Authoritative Guide to Affordable Food, Fuel, and Shelter",While an interesting read I feel that this publication leaves one wondering if this shouldn't have been a leaflet. I don't believe that certain chapters actually cover the subjects effectively while others seem to be overdone.The chapter on stocking up is fairly strange. Buying cases of paper towells is not really what those of us who actually practise living on less would do.....leaves one wondering who the book is written for.I feel that this was a frivilous purchase on my part.
4,I really agree with Ahira51...,"...although I hesitate in giving this single 4 stars because three of the songs are already available on the 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' OST. You can get that OST for the same price as this, BUT there is one good thing about this maxi CD, which I bought here: 'Green Destiny,' which I don't think is included on the original soundtrack.The song itself was nominated for an Academy Award probably because of the song's strength and how good it was. I don't know about it being a 'sell-out,' but this is a negative viewpoint I won't get into.Myself, it broke my heart as hard as did Nakashima Mika from Japan did with her 'Stars' when I saw her on TV back in 2001. And to think I SERIOUSLY love the latter!So, in the end, if you go out and buy this CD or the CTHD OST, I hope you appreciate it or you can send it back. Later."
3,"Once again, Coco needs a good song!","Although this was a song for the hit movie, it wasn't strong or emotional enough. This girl desperately needs a good song in the States because I think she is actually talented and does have a lot of potential in the future, but at moment her talent is wasted by bad songs."
1,Unimpressive,"I was disappointed with the song. Her voice didn't go beyond ordinary. She can sing but not a competitive singer must I say. I wonder why the song was nominated in the Oscars. And, what's up with the flinging of fingers there? Does she really wanna be Mariah Carey?"
1,a waste of money,it doesn't mean I'm chinese i have to like her. I really don't like her voice. it's too mediocre like J.Lo. The song was ordinary. Don't you think it was a sell out?
2,CD review,The shipping packaging was not sufficient to protect the cheap plastic CD holders. All three were cracked and broke as soon as you opened them. I've have the CD for over 2 months now and they are skipping and missing during the songs. Not good for frequent use.
5,Awesome!,"I love these tapes. If you follow instruction and really follow through, you're sure to learn!"
1,spectra Premium Radiator,"This did not fit a 1987 Toyota as I was told it would. I am going to have to elongate mounting holes. I would not have bought it if I knew I was going to have to work on it before it would work. Tm mounting hole pattern is off by about 1/4""or more."
3,A Little Misleading,"I chose this book over others because of the included CD-ROM that has ""practice exams."" To me this meant that I would be able to sit in front of my computer and complete entire exams to get the feel for the format and to make the scoring process faster. Practice exams in reality means that you'll get to take a look at the format of the test and you can practice clicking on navigational buttons, but you don't actually get to take practice tests on your computer.You can actually download the information that you get on the CD-ROM from the CLEP web site for free.The practice exams in the book are useful, but I'd say that ""Cracking the CLEP"" and ""CLEP Success"" are just as thorough in serving as study guides.If the CD-ROM is what is enticing you to choose this title over the others, don't let it... it's more handy as a coaster than a study aid."
2,Superficial overviews; not real study material.,"This book gives a brief review and one mini practice test for all 34 CLEP tests. You probably aren't taking 34 CLEPs. For the ones you do plan to take, a comprehensive prep book on that subject is far more helpful. For a tight budjet and several tests however, this book definately can be an aid."
2,Overview Book,"This book is not well written, I have two other books from SAMS publishing and was expecting this to be of the same caliber, I was disapponinted.There is no depth of information. At best it is an overview not a instructional tool, certianly not complete by any stretch of the imagination.If I were you I would look to another source if you want more than a basic overview of projection TV repair."
1,Useless for Troubleshooting,"As a computer technician, I expected to use this book in conjunction with my existing knowledge of electronics to perform basic repairs on projection televisions. I was disappointed.Despite the title, this book is not structured as a troubleshooting guide and is anything but complete. At best, it is a broad overview of the components in a typical projection TV. The book is full of sentences like:""If you suspect the vertical oscillator is not working...""without explaining how or why we should suspect the vertical oscillator is not working.If you want a broad overview of concepts and components relating to project TV repair, this book is for you. If you are looking for comprehensive troubleshooting steps, however, you should look elsewhere."
1,adobe premiere,"This excrutiangly awfull program should be avoided at all costs. I have wasted dozens of hours just trying to get it to work. In fact, I have spent more time trying to fix technical problems than I have spent editing video projects. Once the free technical support period expires, you'll have to pay two dollars a minute to speak to one of Adobe's inept technical support representatives."
5,Another gadget stored away,Like everyone else I like icecream. Thought I would make it more than I do. Used it maybe three times. Hard to clean and the freezer container take up a ton of room in the freezer.
2,Trouble in paradise,"I originally wrote a very positive review about this ice cream machine.Unfortunately, on my third use, the machine broke. When making a single batch, the motor would shudder or skip. It was almost as if the motor was binding up against something or was becoming jammed.So I had to return in to the store and exchanged it. I'll keep you posted on whether I have trouble with the second one or not."
1,GREAT - If you want cool cream with chunks,"I started out freezing the bowls for 3 days (much longer than the few recommended hours). I followed all the instructions to make butter pecan ice cream. I let the machine run for 30 minutes, poured the COOLED contents into an airtight container, inspected the mess, dumped the crap right into the trash. The ""ice cream"" was no colder than when I put it in the machine. Perhaps my particular Flavor Duo was defective, but given the contantly diminishing quality of Cuisinart products I would assume this item was working as designed. I cannot recommend this product. A complete disappointment."
5,Best ice cream ever,This cool machine does a great job.The secret is keep everything very cold.Store your canisters in your freezer at the lowest temperature.Keep milk and whipping cream very cold and you will be amazed at how nice the ice cream turns out.The best ever!
2,Reading it on the Kindle is frustrating.,Textual notes and annotations are not easily assessable from the page one is reading. To read a footnote one has to go to the table of contents and click a notes link.
4,Nice snapshot of a great local band,"I saw Agent Orange about 3-4 times in 1986-87, and while this is more power pop than what I remember...IT DOES still have the feeling/guitar sound of what I recall. It does sound like there might be audience track here-but who cares. The band sounds great. Compare with Bloostained Hitz-much more pure Agent Orange. I'd love to see Mike release a live recording from The Music Machine in that later 80's period---Gibson SG and Marshall amps!!!!!!"
4,"Raw, but with lots of emotion.","OK, yes this album is raw and yes Mike's vocals are a little harsh in some places, but it is a great live album for the diehard fan of old school punk. In fact, a lot of the songs are different versions then the studio ones, and sound very cool. For you old schoolers out there Social Distortions Mommy's Little Monster was not that great a recording and Ness was a sloppy guitar player back then, but the album is a punk rock classic. I'm not saying this is a classic but it IS an album to be appreciated and well worth four stars."
2,I'd hate to see real fake sound,"Agent Orange's only live album ""Real Live Sound"" is a sign of the times it was recorded in. 1990. L.A. The Roxy....The first thing that came to my mind just by looking at the cover and liner notes was the pop sound of the moment in 1990...pop heavy metal. And guess what? This is Agent Orange doing its best impersonation of a pop metal act.All the classic elements are here. A Drum solo. Cheerleading by Mike Palm. Half-... guitar playing. What seems to be lots of fake sounding female screams. And an intro by a deep-voiced roadie. As a former recovering metal junkie...I was thinkin' gawd I'm not listening to W.A.S.P. Live in the Raw..Am I? But as I listened more and more I could tell that this was not the band that laid down one of the best albums I have ever heard at the beginning of the 80s. This was something KISS would do...lie down some tracks live and polish them up. The first studio album with warts and all was more ""live"" than this mess."

1,Major Label screws up again,"I'll have to agree with the previous reviewer. I'm not intimately familiar with Agent Orange, but this is anything but ""Real Live Sound"". From the faked roadie intro to the added screaming to the studio recorded between song banter, this is a prime example of how major record labels manipulate perfectly good bands. Given that is was recorded in 1991, during the heyday of the cocaine and glam fueled pop metal era (in L.A., no less) it's a wonder that it isn't worse. Some of the songs are good, however, but to put them into rotation on my pirate radio station I had to do some pretty heavy editing. Is Restless Records still in business? They shouldn't be."
5,my favorite tonique,"love itlancome tonique is always my favorite,wl keep to use. On the same time,l love the pink tonique too."
3,UFO plastics Ghibli review,"Good headlight for the price, i wired mine up to have the high beam work with the 10w running light, so giving me 45w, fit perfectly on my crf230f and gives great light, comes with everything you need, its an older style, but i think it looks and works great.one thing is, you will have to figure out which is ground/running light/high beam and low beam, as there are no instructions, diagrams or anything! and no wires, so you will have to solder them on, took a bit to figure out, but i got it."
3,Great music - Poor sound quality,"I actually rate 5 stars to the band, but only 1 star to the CD quality. I bought this CD because I own the album (33RPM record (yeah, I'm old)) but I wanted to listen to it on CD. The music on this CD is great (the band is great), but the quality of the CD is very poor. You have to turn the volume way up and it still isn't very loud and/or clear - obviously not a fault of Agent Orange. I think the producers could have done a better job re-releasing this on CD. Buy it to listen to Agent Orange, but beware of the poor quality recording."
1,Someone can do better,"This book is frustrating to read full of outdated references and has a terrible index. I cannot believe I had to waste money on this book for my class. Someone please make a better textbook. Trying to read this book is like putting a puzzle together. Each paragraph jumps from one area to the another. Right when you think your about to find the information you need to support your essay the books jumps into an unrelated tangent. This is the worst textbook I have ever had and I could not figure out why until I read the authors' biography. Both authors are from the school right across town. Surprise, Surprise. If you need to take a special education course and it is requiring this textbook find another text book to use. You will be glad you did."
1,"Bogus! IMSI just made a dishonest ""buck""!","I think this product is advertised incorrectly. You do not GET, as in recieve, 1,500,000 clip art images like you expect to. You may (with much struggle) get ""ACCESS to"" at an online internet site. When I buy clipart I want to OWN the clipart -not just a subscription. I'm still on dial-up 56k internet and downloading images is slow. The interface is hard and a typical PC style hassle and I wouldn't let my kids near it. We use Macs also for our graphics and their ""browser"" style application is not compatible with Macs. Don't waste your time or your ""bucks""."
2,Disappointing,"I too have bought clip art from IMSI for many years. Every time I was happy. This time, I'm thinking I'm getting a huge library of clip art. NOT. I'm getting unlabeled CDs (I finally stumble on the file that has the listing - after I went through them all) only to find out that most of these images I got on previous versions of their clip art. THEN I find out the rest of the 1.5M images are only available for a year on line. No, I'm not happy. I'm certainly going to think twice before I buy their product again."
1,Disappointed,"I did lots of research on various clipart software before purchasing this product. I was satisfied with a previous version of IMSI Masterclips (Masterclips 303,000) that I borrowed from a friend. You would assume that the latest version would be even better, of course. Well, I assumed incorrectly. I am extremely disappointed with this software. I gave it a rating of ""1"" only because that is as low as you will allow me to rate it. The software consists of 12 CDs, which are horribly organized. They claim that they are organized in an intuitive manner, but I beg to differ. Previous versions contained a reference book for easily locating a specific piece of clipart. This useful reference was left out of this edition. In addition to the lack of organization and proper references, I was also not very impressed with the clipart itself. If you absolutely insist on buying clipart software from IMSI, stick to Masterclips 303,000."
2,"Walks, not hikes","This book, like others in this series, is really a set of easy walks, not hikes. Admittedly, I am an avid hiker, but nothing longer than 8 miles is present (not a single overnight hike). Also, many of these hikes are somewhat roundabout. While I'm all for loops, these are on not-too-clearly labelled areas with quite a few road walks. It seems like there must be more in Massachusetts than this."
4,Great book! Especially for the beginner in hiking!,"This book is great, especially for a beginner at hiking (which I am). It gives you great spots to check out, lets you know how long the distance is and about how long it will take to hike it. You can find hikes from .6 of a mile to 8.5 miles. There are plenty of hikes for every level. The only thing I wish the book had slightly more detailed trail maps, but usually you can get them easily enough."
5,Heightened Libido,"What are some of your darkest sexual fantasies? You may have some you're not even aware of.That's what I discovered when I read this book. It's an erotic romance that will either compel you to push forward with your own fantasies, have sex, or excessively crave intimacy with another.Never, in my life, have I been so aroused just by reading a book. My libido was at an all-time high.And I have to say it's one of the most audacious books I've come across thus far.Bridget truly knows her erotica. And if you're looking to learn a thing or two, you most certainly won't be disappointed while reading this baby.Within it, you'll be sure to find effervescent scenes, lots and lots of sex, drama, romance, and many things more.It's a very difficult book to set down once you get started. The only reason one might take a break from it would be to have sex."
2,I Was Not Fascinated....,"I was more annoyed. I love Bridget Midway books, particularly when she deals with BDSM. She's one of the best in the game. 'Fascination Street' however, I did not love. I had to force myself to finish. The heroine in this book annoyed the crap out of me. I don't mind a little couple swapping, but the neighbors were just so intrusive. I don't see how anyone could be comfortable with others inserting themselves into your life to that degree. This story was just not my cup of tea."
2,Definitely not one of her best,I had to force myself to finish this book and am more than a little irritated at how much I spent. I have not once read a bad book by her...well until now.Zora irritated me to know end and not to mention Grant.I think a big part of why I didn't like this is because of the couple swapping. I guess I thought they would try it for a while and realize that they just need each other. That was not the case and the part of throwing Grant's boss inot the mix just seemed unrealtistic. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers who said that this book was basically one big sex fest. I mean virtually every page was filled with some kind of sex.
2,DONT BE FOOLED BY THE DVD COVER...........,"......It's not in the movie. So just for the record cover 10-movie 2. The film rips off ""The Hidden"" and David Cronenbergs ""Shivers"" a.k.a. ""They Came From Within"" where a parasitic creature passes from one host to another. To pretend the makers of this film are ""original"" the creature enters the host through the bellybutton. Also the hosts become ravenously hungry and the one funny scene happens when a cop is invaded and he reaches for the donuts.The movies major problem is despite an occassional burst of gore the movie is so lifeless and slow."
1,POS,"Wowee, what a piece of crap this was. So let me get this straight the ""hero"" of the movie witnesses a bloody death and runs away without calling police, 911, and/or an ambulance eventhough he had a pretty legitimate explanation for it all.The ""heroine"" of the movie eventhough she has every reason to believe that the ""hero"" could be guilty of a terrible crime aides and abides his get away.I know, I know, it's only a movie but the plot was to thin and unbelievable for me.The whole movie is riddled with unbelievable scenarios, unbelievable acting, and an unbelievable plot. Too bad. I'm glad I got to see this one for free."
2,Hared to watch.,"I know movies such as this one, is a stagging ground for young or new talent. In this case, I would have to say it's more of a training session. However, I would like to point out that the special effects, and make up artist , did, fairly, good job. The script was not all that good. the actor's, and actress need to learn that they are sale people. They need to learn how to sell their characters.I give this one a two star."
3,Through The Belly Button...,"SpoilersSpoilersSpoilersA Demonic parasitic entity has survived several hundred years and is again lose upon a small town taking over bodies in an attempt to reproduce itself, entering through the victims bellybutton where the victim somehow doesn't even know that it has happened.The movie itself is really just a step above the sci-fi channel movies. In that is is good for what it is, just don't expect a a Hollywood blockbuster. The film has its blood and guts moments but throws in some comedy as well, proving that the movie never take itself very seriously. From the burping and farting of the victims to the doughnut eating policeman feeding the parasite in his belly while rolling on a police chase. A horror comedy that doesn't excel at either genre that well.Just don't expect a masterpiece of a motion picture, and you will be satisfied. If you like sci-fi channel quality movies this will be right up your alley.i"
3,Not Too Terrible,"Well, I think some here are being a little too harsh. This certainly isn't a great movie, it's one step up from a Sci-Fi Channel original. On the other hand it doesn't do anything terribly wrong either.It's a thriller, not a real horror flick, so don't expect too many scares. And it's a bit cheesy. But I watch quite a few new horrors, and at last I didn't feel like turning it off!Nah - not bad, not great. The CGI'd monsters were cool.... Average."
5,Good resource,"This book is a good and accessible resource on the life of Victorian novelist Elizabeth Gaskell. The editor, J.A.V. Chapple is also one of the editors of the full collection of Gaskell's correspondence:The Letters of Mrs. Gaskell. However, that collection is not surprisingly very long and prohibitively expensive for the general reader.This book, A Portrait in Letters, is available at a reasonable price and is short enough to read all the way through. The book is arranged by subjects relevant to Gaskell's life, and it includes excerpts from Gaskell's letters along with editorial comments from Chapple that add context.While serious Gaskell scholars will want to consult the complete Letters of Mrs. Gaskell, this volume is perfect for the general reader, and it serves as a helpful compilation of the most famous and frequently-cited of Gaskell's letters."
5,Railroads' approaches to declining passenger business,"An outstanding history of the decline and eventual end of private-sector rail passenger service in the United States. Veteran railroad author and Trains magazine correspondent Fred Frailey details the varying approaches taken by different railroads to the pressures of competition from the highways and airlines and of regulation by state and federal agencies, all of them ultimately ending with the creation of Amtrak. Well illustrated with black and white and some color photographs, along with detailed diagrams illustrating routes and consists of major trains, this is a well-written look at the passenger rail industry of the 1960s."
4,good stuff,i bought this album when it came out(87or88).i dont know why really as i dont really listen to thrashy metal.but i have to say that these guys can play.
2,meh,"I've never liked death angel and this album proves why. basically this album has ""thrashers"" wich has a great riff and harsh vocals, and though drags on is still a good listen and ""the ultra violence"".....now i will admit ""the ultra violence"" is one of the greatest songs in metal and is a true classic. but the rest of the album is pure filler with bland generic riffs and annoying vocals. Only for real die hard thrash fans, and don't pay more than 5$ for this album."
5,"10 Stars, Death Angel Rules!",See the reviews on the top of this message.They are all true just get this awesome cd!
5,Mandatory purchase!!!,"This my friends in their time, was one of the best thrash albums ever made. The guitar work here is excellent!!! With incredible solos, great vocals and solid musicianship throghout. Back in the day, i bought this on cassette, but now i get it on CD. So, if you like Dark Angel, Slayer, Forbidden, give this a try!!!"
2,Does not operate quietly,"I purchased this dehumidifier because my last one, after 12 years of use, finally bit the dust. I thought that in 12 years there would have been some improvements made in dehumidifiers. This item is advertised as ""quiet operation"". I have this dehumidifier plugged into a wall in my family room that is about 30 feet away from where I sit and every time it turns on I cannot hear the television. This thing is loud! If I had known how loud it operates, I wouldn't have bought it."
3,self congratulatory pseudo feminist psychobabble tripe,"I am still a big fan of the Spenser novels.Always fun to read (and a fast read too); Spenser's repartee with Hawk is still my favorite part. In fact, Hawk is the only character who retains some sense of continuity, but I cannot understand what it is about Susan Silverman that appeals to him. Susan Silverman is a royal pain and loses Parker 2 stars. Who gives a rat's about her self indulgent, quite boring and overly-needy ego? No empathy here. Spenser should dump her and go for Rita Fiore. Even getting it on with Rachel Wallace would make a better read."
2,Is Susan an only child or the youngest of three?,"I love all of Parker's Spenser novels. However, lately he seems to forget the background he's given some of them. Susan is a good case in point. Many books ago(maybe A Catskill Eagle?) Susan tells Spenser she is the youngest of three. Now, amazingly, she was an only child. Which is it? Seems Parker is not interested enough in this character to be consistent. And enough of her whining already. She has become a stereotype. Hawk/Spenser dialogue is the best part of the novels. Not enough of that here. Still, looking forward to the next installment."
4,"Spenser keeps going, fading a bit","We've gone through the entire series and in fact I have them all reviewed. I really admire his ethics, and like the characterizations, but Susan bugs me. She romps through life, treating Spenser unkindly, and he sticks by her. Does she deserve it? In this novel she's not exactly sane. At least she helps him with a brick at for sure that Brad won't come back and kill Susan later! What bothered me most was his train of thought with the ""cheated-on husband"" - it's better to be lied to than to know the truth. WHAT???"
3,TOO PSYCHO FOR ME,"I love Spenser but this novel was way too much psychoanalysis for me. It got a bit boring, too. Why Susan was attracted to bad men and all that baloney did nothing to make me feel for Susan and why was Rachel Wallace in this? The story line had a lot of promise but it just faltered. Won't keep me from reading more of Parker's books on Spenser."
3,Light-Weight But Enjoyable,"After Small Vices, this seemed to be pretty light-weight as far a story line went. I always enjoy the humor that Parker injects into his tales, and there was plenty in this book. The scene where two thugs enter Spenser's office and threaten him...didn't that same thing happen in a recent Spenser book? An enjoyable if light-weight read."
3,Selfish Susan at it again,"Susan Silverman, the pinnacle of the selfish, self-involved (...), strikes again. This time she expects Spenser to save her ex-husband while putting up with her petty bitchery about him saving her ex-husband. The (...) mental. I do not understand why Parker feels compelled to include such a worthless character in all his books. She really ruins the story lines."
2,Good Book - but HORRIBLE READING for audio version,While the story was entertaining- the strange intonations of the reader made me stop listening about halfway through - which is pretty bad considering the price of audio books! Save your sanity - and money and AVOID this audio book.
3,Spenser goes to his class reunion,"While enjoyable most of the time, this book reminded me of a ""This Is Your Life"" episode.Without any real reason, Spenser runs into any number of people from previous books (e.g., Rachel Wallace). It's the equivalent of a class reunion, completed with bored significant-other (Susan).I enjoyed the book because Spenser spends a lot of time with Hawk. The plot isn't very flash (e.g., he beats up thugs in his office, he tries to intimidate various tough guys), but the dialogue with Hawk is fantastic.Susan whinges a bit less than usual. Unlike books where she's carrying on like a pork chop, I didn't have to turn each page hoping for a hostage drama involving Susan which goes horribly wrong (albeit only from Spenser's point of view).If you're going to start reading Spenser books, there are better ones. However, if you like Hawk's comments, I think this one is definitely worthwhile reading."
2,"Save your money, find a new author","Spenser is back. And it's too bad. Better to remember him as he was. Not as bad as ""Chance"", but just about as bad as ""Thin Air"". Parker ran out of new ideas right around ""Paper Doll"" and though ""Walking Shadow"" fought bravely, Spenser is dead. Or should be. Does anybody care about Susan's childhood? Does anyone want to hear the line about Hitler liking dogs again? NO. Spesner fans want Spenser and Hawk in motion. They want the glory days of Spenser breaking Hawk out of jail. Susan's ex-husband shows up in this one, and she sends him to Spenser for help. Appearances by series favorites Quirk, Rachel Wallace, Lee Farrell and Tony Marcus don't do enough to assuage the irritation felt by the long'time fan. Don't even think about looking for Frank Belson.What a waste of paper."
3,I skip the Susan parts,"In reading the past three or four books, I skipped right over the inter-chapters depicting Spenser with Susan. It makes for quick reading and I miss nothing."
3,it's hard not to love Spenser,"but I agree with everyone else... Please get rid of Susan's angst! It seemed to stymie, rather than clarify, Parker's plot in this one. And the way the plot has been strung together... I think he's produced better in earlier novels, hasn't he?Still, we're so fond of Spenser (and not the Ulrich TV version, either! i listen to the Burt Reynolds audio books) that we can excuse a lot, including lame dialogue and weak plotting. Sigh... such beautiful memories of earlier excursions, but I'm sure Spenser will rise again to fight the evils of the world and eat plenty of good oysters and merlot.And it's okay if Susan's there, too. I admire his devotion, but she might eventually annoy me if I ever read all 25 Spenser novels."
5,This book is dark and mentally thought provoking!,"Once again Robert B. Parker has gone out and written a masterful novel in the Spenser series. This time Spenser is asked to look into a sexual harasssment case against Susan's ex- husband, Brad Silverman. As Spenser digs deeper and deeper into the past of Brad and Susan, Brad suddenly disappears. Because Spenser and Hawk found a dead body in Brad's office suspicion is shifted towards Brad and his cloudy and questionable past. When one of Brad's other ex- wives is found murdered that is when Spenser becomes very confused about where Brad is hiding and who killed these two people. Happy reading spenser fans!"
3,Ready for Retirement???,"While Sudden Mischief is better than some other recent efforts, it looks like Mr. Parker and his characters have run out of steam. Not unreasonable since Spenser is a veteran of the Korean War. I have read and enjoyed the entire series of Spenser novels but have becoming increasingly disappointed with lack of energy the recent novels have demonstrated. I'm afraid that Sudden Mischief is the last Spenser novel I'll ever purchase. Guess it's time to find a new author with less focus on the food/beverages and more focus on the action."
2,"Works well, when it works!","Worked beautifully right out of the box. However, it only took the heater a matter of 26 days before it only worked when it worked and the moving parts lodged on themselves. Would not recommend buying this item, just because there are some serious kinks that DeLonghi needs to work out in this thing. Great idea, bad execution."
1,Better sit CLOSE,"After 2 day with heater, it is way too small to heat anything too far away. I have to sit right next to it to feel any heat. Better put it on Max also. My unit for some reason the blows heat on the bottom, then cool air on top. Smart if you want a fan and heater at the same time in the winter. Oscillating doesn't do a thing but make small background noise...You think some kind of insect is in you house. Don't waste you money on this one. Return slip is filled out already."
3,"Not The Joyous Read That Panati's ""Beginnings"" Was","I loved Panati's ""beginnings"" book so I thought, gosh, how bad could the endings be? Well, it wasn't bad - I gave it three stars after all. It was just a lot less exciting and enjoyable than beginnings.To a degree it's because the endings are less joyful as occasions than beginnings. Everyone loves beginnings, but when things come to an end it's usually not because they were still thriving and successful. So, in and of itself this book was bound to be a little darker. Just hoped it wouldn't have been THIS different from the 'beginnings' book."
1,built incorrectly,"The plug is on the wrong side of the unit! It hits the intake manifold and can not be installed! It DOES NOT fit a 2003 Explorer Sport with the 4.0. Either they have their part interchange wrong, or somebody in quality control was asleep when this was built. pay close attention to the plug direction when buying one of these."
3,Wierd movie. Could have been better.,Close to being good. Sound quality poor.Interesting to see russian language used for English characters like roosevelt.Churchhill looks like a monster and had to much makeup.Stalin looks like he is wearing rubber mask.I think the acting was fine for many but not all. Just the script was poor.Hitler was interesting and well performed I thought.Lots of tanks and explosions and lighting good. The gun fire and person to person action is very weak and unsatisfying. The other reviews are very complete and good but wanted to add my 2 cents. Worth checking out once if your a ww2 history enthusiast.
5,Pleasures is delicious,"I absolutely adore this perfume. It's classic, it's clean, it's not terribly expensive. I love that my clothes will still smell like it after I wash them.Buy it!"
4,The Middle Child,"It seems that not only middle children have a unique plac but middle books as well. Spiral Passage is is the second of the first trilogy of the McFadden series. Introducing more characters and storylines Spiral Passage is a link between Stolen Shadows and Level Ground primarily. It is a good read, especially if the reader didn't read Stolen Shadows, on its own as well.While characters don't develop the same intensity as in Stolen Shadows and Level Ground, it is a very nice book to read. Tells about the further adventures of Adam and Philip and Devon and their family. There is a big surprise coming!I highly recommend it to all readers with an open mind."
1,an edition to be avoided,"Great war film but a very disapointing copy: very poor quality of both sound and image. This edition (with no name of film editor on the DVD and whose image on the box does not match the one put on the internet site of amazon) is to be avoided absolutlely: it is no more than a sort of ""pirat quality"" copy. A. De Toth and his great filming deserve much better."
3,Not Much Christmas,"I am hooked on the happenings in Covington. It is always fun to read the next installment of the saga of Hannah, Amelia and Grace and their community of friends. I think the title should have been Winter Weddings. There just wasn't too much Christmas. It was an enjoyableread nevertheless. The mystery woman from Paris; the love revealed and renewed and some unresolved relationships leave the door open for more stories from Covington."
2,Disappointed,"I just don't have much to say about this one. I have so enjoyed the previous books in this series, but was quite disappointed with this one. Everything from the story line to the writing style was terrible. I wanted to read about the ladies that I have grown to love, but this story was about the other residents of Covington with hardly a word about Grace, Hannah and Amelia.The only reason I finished it was because I actually spent money to purchase the book instead of checking it out at the library. Otherwise, I would have put it down and never picked it up again.I hope the next book lives up to the quality of the others before this one!"
5,A superb album!,"A roaring fireplace, a bottle of red wine and good company... let Julio set the mood!"
1,Ao meu Brasil,"Save your money; if you are a Julio fan, you already have 9 of the 13 numbers on this album! I'm angry and disappointed!"
1,A classic psychopath,"I could not finish this book. It's extremely uncomfortable to read - Shyamalan comes across as a self-centered egomaniac hell bent on forcing people to accept his idiotic vison. I guess he's taken his marketing material to heart.He needs to learn to be an adult. Unfortunately, it's unlikley. He'll be directing ""spooky"" informercials for hair care & ab products within five years."
2,made me feel,"icky. I like MNS. A lot. I like the things he says in interviews, I like his movies. I don't think they are perfect, but they speak to me. This book, while an interesting and easy read, is not fun. I can't imagine that he would like how he is depicted in it....he hasn't really publicly commented on it, other than to say the author had his full support. I don't know--it just seemed a weird portrait of someone...it seemed over-dramatic and Vanity Fair article-esque. Or like Confessions of a Shopaholic. Ew. I don't know what MNS is really like or if Bamberger interpreted things accurately. I just try to remember that everyone perceives situations differently.[...]"
1,A waste of time.,I am tired of reading the words from this book by page 10. At page 20 I have to put the book down and throw up. This author sucks. One should have to pass a test before they are allowed to publish a book.
2,An easy fun read with little substance,"I'm a big fan of Bamberger's writing. His prose is still excellent, and if he could have pried his lips off of Shyamalan's backside for a bit, this book could have been very good. Instead it appears as though the author fancied a career as Night's PR director in the near future. A big disappointment. Honestly, the heavy-handed rose-colored portrayals of Night's actions and personality are too much to bear and are as transparent as they are unbelievable. Any facts that contradict or shed a truly critical eye on the director are ignored or clumsily dismissed. Tellingly, Bamberger ends his lovefest before the movie is released...sparing himself the task of justifying what a horrible bomb this ""masterpiece"" turned out to be."
1,save your money,"The one star is for the book's oft-mentioned unintentional hilarity, and because I borrowed it-- so, no zero-star indignation at money poorly spent. As a testamonial of filmmaking, it offers few insights, but as a strangely icky love letter to its subject, TMWHV can be truly cringe-a-minute. Could not put it down, until about 50 pages in, then could not pick it up again, because it gets really tedious."
1,Do not buy this book,This book is a pile of Shyamalan. Boring.......this book will not help us in any way! I am upset that I spend the money and spent my time.
5,From another Filmmaker,"The highs, the lows, the ups, the downs, the anger and the peace... and that's only the first 40 pages.As a film student and someone who has collected nearly 400 pages of essays, articles, interviews, and more on the life and work of Shyamalan, this tell-all tome is a page-turning read that would fit right into the collection of anyone in and out of the film industry who wishes to take a peek into the secretive life of a great Filmmaker.Upon reading this book I have an even more profound respect for a brilliant man who seeks, for better or worse, to test the waters (pun intended) of the film medium and its audience.One can sense the anxiety, inspiration, inner-demons, hope, joy, diary-esque narrative and more within the boiling pot called ""Lady in the Water"". With this book the movie becomes even more conversation-inducing, biographicaly-microscopic, and metorphoricaly-laden than one can ever notice on just one viewing.A great book about a great Director."
4,"Great seller, okay product.","The item arrived promptly and in the condition described. I read the book, it was okay, I guess, but I wont hold the writing quality against the seller."
5,Good Read For M. Night Fans and Film Buffs,"I don't believe there are enough good books out there about directors and how they approach film making. A film buff like me is interested in hearing about the challenges, trials and mishaps in film making, not a glossy promotional hype piece to sell the movie. Whether you appreciate M. Night's films or not, you can't help but at least appreciate his struggles in this book. It has lots of insight into the director as well as just about every actor and stand-in on set to some degree or another. We all know the movie was finished and reached theaters but I still couldn't put it down to find out the details and stories behind what you see on screen. The hollywood talk may bore typcial movie watchers but film buffs will enjoy this."
1,The Man Who Heard Razzberries,"I agree that Bamberger could be the greatest satirist living, if that was his intention. The endless verbal oral sex the author performs on his subject...The abject awe...It is truly hilarious.It's also true that you'll only enjoy laughing at this road apple of a book IF you didn't pay anything for it, as I didn't.Let us all hope that in the future, M. Night Shamalamadingdong does NOT listen to the same voices that told him to put out ""Lady in the Water,"" AND this book."
2,So Bad it hurts (in your funny bone),"This book is a delight to read. Rarely does one come across a nonfiction piece that manages to create such a wellspring of hatred, animosity and overwhelming ill-will toward its author and subject as this.The writing is often atrocious, in keeping with the author's journalistic background. But it is the near-constant and over-the-top adulation he evinces toward Shyamalan that keeps us spellbound. Was there any irony in his comments? Was the potential paycheck too alluring to give him any reason to ruffle Shyamalan's feathers?Or, maybe, just maybe, Bamberger is such a genius that by playing dumb, he manages to brilliantly illuminate what a world-class megalomaniac M Night Shyamalan is. Read the book, but don't drop a penny on it."
4,The First Nafta Railroad,"After Arthur Stillwell built his Kansas City Southern Railroad, he turned his attention to yet another rail line which would tie Kansas City to the closest Pacific port - Topolobampo, Mexico. This was the Kansas City, Mexico, & Orient Railway which later was swallowed by the Santa Fe only to be spit out in recent years as the South Orient. John Kerr's book tells the story complete with illustrations and a KCM&O Locomotive Roster. This book was published in 1968 while the line was securely in Santa Fe hands. A unique book on unique railroad. Hardback, 270 pages."
5,Very Happy,"Beautiful book, very happy with it, and with the delivery, from the time I ordered it to receiving it; it was less than a week. Will be ordering more in the future."
2,Good video for the already experienced,"I bought this DVD for my kids since they are always trying to follow along with my practice videos only to find out they are better off trying to follow mine instead of following this one. In this DVD there is no instruction telling kids how to achieve any of the poses, and they move from one pose to another without telling the kids how to get there. If your kids already have yoga experience, then they should do fine following along with this DVD, but if your kids haven't done yoga before then you really should find another video."
3,Book,"Hi. I'm find this book hard to read. It seems to be going on and on, using out landish words and not getting to the point. But, i'm still reading so well see."
3,Decent price for good storage,"I bought this item for back-up storage of my pictures, videos, music, word documents, and personal files. I have a Mac and the USB port was convient. I wish the item was a little smaller. I've noticed for around the same price of $80, you can get 60-80GB storage drives that are a lot smaller.Also, the rate of download to the drive was very slow. I usually set it out and left it unattended to download files of over 10GB for 15-20 minutes. It's a lot slower than firewire drives or even other high-speed USB drives. There's an option to make it faster for PC and Mac, but once you program it that way you can't use the drive with the opposite brand ever again. Maybe the addition of Bootcamp will help Mac users but I can't be sure.Overall, good for the storage, but I think cheaper, faster, and smaller drives are coming out."
4,Great drive,"A little pricier than other models I found shortly after buying it, but it works great and communicates very quickly with my PC. Fast save times."
2,"commonplace, mundane nostalgia","I was disappointed. I had hoped for so much more. He treads ground already well-beaten by his predecessors Charles Sheeler, Paul Strand, Andre Kertesz, Walker Evans, but without their eye for the arresting perspective or the play of light and form. His compositions are rather flat and banal, more like postcards for the scenes he presents, wrapped in a hazy glow of romanticized nostalgia reminiscent of dorm room Edward Hopper prints.There are a few pictures that rise above the mediocre to reach the level of pretty good, such as his White Castle photo or the nighttime scene of Petit's Mobil Station, but even these seem to rely on a striking, but cheap, play of light illuminating darkness to achieve their effect. Overall, one gets the sense that he's a Thomas Kinkade who wishes he were Charles Sheeler."
4,A good start to a new series,"Alec is quite wonderful; what a dreamboat. Katherine is sometimes annoying, but she's young and badly influenced. She tends to think the worst of Alec and the best of Sydney, who is such a momma's boy. It is also rather hypocritical of her to be concerned about Alec marrying for money when that was her goal, the difference being it was access to her own money. But she had convinced herself that she was in love with her longtime friend, Sydney.Despite Katherine's sometimes annoying and wrong opinions about Alec and her unfathomable wish to marry Sydney, she does finally see the light and all her best characteristics come forth. The set-up for the series is excellent, and the book has a generous share of delightful scenes. I enjoyed it a lot."
2,Too modern,"Since she is well-regarded, I decided to try Jeffries. What a disappointment! The plot was interesting, and the idea for the series great, but the language was appalling. The heroine actually says, several times, that she cannot ACCESS HER FORTUNE! Plus, the idea of a debutante tricked out in red and still retaining any reputation is without credibility. She may be able to write dialogue, but her sense of period was awful. I doubt I will try her again."
5,Whoo-Hoo!,"No need to go into the story (Harriet took care of that), but after finishing this book I had to drop in a quick note saying: BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! You won't be sorry."
5,In the Prince's Bed,It was a very good book. I enjoyed reading it. Most of Sabrina's books are good. Looking forward to reading more.
2,Not as good as I expected it to be,"Before I read a book, I always check the Amazon customer reviews first. This book received a pretty high review, so I thought that I would give it a try. I have to say, however, that I was pretty disappointed with this book. The plot was pretty bland, and I just didn't really care for the characters very much. I felt like there wasnt a great connection with the main characters, and even by the end of the book, I still wasn't convinced that they were in love with eachother!! There were so many opportunities for supporting characters to play a bigger role in the novel, but none of the opportunities were taken by the author. In no way was this a bad book...I just wouldn't say that it deserves the 4 star rating on Amazon. If you are looking for a GREAT historical romance novel, pick up a Julie Garwood novel instead."
4,great reading,"this book was very charming and fun. Really great characters all the way through, after reading this book i read the rest of the series that same weekend. Sabrina Jefferies has a very nice, smooth style of writting that is very engaging."
5,A must read romance!,"In the prince's bed is the kind of romance novel I look for. Very entertaining, wonderful dialogue, & tension filled steamy romance! I liked both Kit and Alec alot! Especially kit as a heroine. She had some smarts to her character (wasn't just a naive virgin). Alec was a hunky seducer & went after what he wanted but was not without feelings. What a gorgeous guy too! (Inside the cover)I have read all of Ms. Jeffries books and have to say I pretty much enjoyed them all. I can count on her books being pretty good & satisfying. Seems like she takes the time writing her books and it shows.In the Prince's Bed had all the requirements, for me, that I like in a romance novel. So much that my life was put on hold till I finished it. (much to my husbands dismay.) Grab it, buy it and enjoy!!!"
3,"I ended up liking it in the end, but I wish it were a modern . . .","I liked the beginning (esp when Alec confronts Kit at the ball and kisses her) and when he takes her riding - the only part that lagged for me was the moments AFTER they decide to marry and he still hasn't told her his secret about wanting to marry an heiress b/c he needs the money...those 3 chapters really lagged and brought down my interest a lot. Then it picked up again when Alec confronts Kit and Sydney and she realizes that Alec really does care about her. It ends happy of course - but I'm really eager to read Draker's story!!!!The character's mannerisms and behavior and attitude in this one seemed very modern - it could've even passed for an early 1900's novel. I also liked the 2nd plot line homosexual love-affair.it was good - but unfortunately it's not in my ""keeper"" pile (hopefully the 2nd book in the series will!)."
5,Rocks,Anyone who knows floater knows they rock...anyone who doesn;t Need to find out... I discoverd them while working as a firefighter the summers in Northern CA where they have a cult following in Chico. Maybe they will spread east eventually. I tell everyone I know here in NY about them and so far everyone has been hooked
3,"Floater is an amazing band, but this CD has poor recording.","Floater is one of my favorite bands. They have a perfect mix of soft and hard beats. They put across strong emotion through thier music. Although I am a diehard floater fan, I only gave this CD three stars because of the poor recording. I highly recommend you purchase their first three CD's before this one. The first three are amazing, and I promise you won't regret buying them."
5,Hexagonal Shafting .. Cuts like Buttah,"From 1/4"" inch, up through the standard 2 1/8"" lockset size, an absolute necessity for anyone developing their wood shop. The cutters are very well made, and the see thru case, with a handle even, rounds out an excellent value. It's too easy to loose track of single cutters .. the case is always easy to find. I shopped around, including a couple of my favorite haunts .. Woodcraft and Highland .. this is as good as it gets. You don't need Carbide, unless you are doing hardwoods on a CNC. The hexagonal shafts are the bees' knees .. never any chuck slippage. Highly recommended."
5,"Good movie for younger kids, about Toddler age..","Most definately a little kids movie. Very cute, but an older kid or adult might find this very kiddy-ish and ""boring"" in my 14 yr old daughters words lol. It IS a cute movie that is child friendly, don't have to worry about language that's not right for your child ect. My 4 year old thought it was just great!"
3,Didn't hold kid's attention,I bought for two grandkids - ages 9 and 5. They saw the preview on a Barbie DVD and asked me to get it. They turned it off halfway through. Just didn't have the attention grabbing action for them. Quality of DVD and animation was fine - must have been the story.
1,never received,My granddaughter loves these videos so I ordered one that she did not have. An attempt to deliver was made on December 13th but today January 5th she still has not received.
5,Inexpensive greenhouse heater,"I purchased the DeLonghi radiator heater for my newly constructed greenhouse after pricing other greenhouse heaters. It's a fabulous value. My 12'x16' greenhouse is glass-walled and I was concerned about the DeLonghi's ability to keep it at a minimum temperature. However, it does a great job! It was extremely easy to set up, the instructions were very helpful in getting it to operate at a set temperature, I like the ability to have it cycle off and on, and it has a useful energy-saving feature. Its compact size is another bonus, as I could tuck it into a corner. There's no need to spend lots of money to heat your greenhouse - use the DeLonghi!"
3,"May be safer, but definitely not without Danger","This heater worked well for me for almost two years, but one night I smelled burning plastic. It turns out that the control mechanism had developed a short and burt the insulation on the internal wires. I don't know if it would have caused a fire. I had assumed a short would cause my breaker to blow, but it just cooked the wiring, and smelled terrible! I would suggest that you don't leave this heater running unattended."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the performance of this radiator. I purchased it based on the reviews from others and expected it to warm up a 600sf room with no problem. It did not. Unless you were sitting/standing within 3-4 feet of the unit, you could not feel heat. I did better with a standard plug in heater! I'm sure this works dandy for smaller areas but not for me."
3,"Good, but electric bill way too high",I had hoped this item would not demand as much electricity as a space heater. Wrong.
5,Delonghi MG15T Magnum Heavy Duty Oil-Filled Radiator,Ordered two. Gave one to a friend who lives in an apartment and I use mine in the lower level family room. Works great for both of us. Heats up the room just great and the thermostat works fine. Very satisfied.
1,Amazon should change the freight forwarder!,"It's a shame that the radiator arrived my apt. completely damaged. It got a major oil leak! Even the carbon box was so oily and smelly - it even damaged the wood floor where I put the box.I really like the radiator but I don't think I buy them from online shops anymore - if I receive the next one, who knows there's another major damage?"
1,Leaks When Stationary!!,No matter what good thing I can say about this itemI cannot recommend it. When stationary the waterleaks back out somewhat and does the same thing whenyou carry it or push it from room to room. Myinvestigation shows that most all carpet cleaners thatare upright do this and the companies know it!Cleans great but if you store it and it is not totallydry you will have a stain where the liquid leaks out.So store it in a place you don't care about! I willseek out a cannister kind or rent... but this problemis a serious one and contact with Bissell shows theyare aware of this. Buy it only if you want to use itto clean up after itself!
1,Beware: Long term test results,"... After only two years my Pro Heat Bissell's water pump just stopped pumping the water/cleaner solution. I would expect more from a model this expensive. We only have a few carpeted rooms in the house, most are hardwood, and we did not use the cleaner THAT much. I would look at other brands for better reliability. Also: When it DID work, it leaked on the floor when not in use! Steer clear of this lemon."
1,Worthless,"Granted, I have had this machine for several years, but I ONLY USED IT TWICE. Now when I really need it, it will not spray. Pump belt was broken and Bissell wanted 7-10 days and a big ""shipping"" fee for a 6-8 inch belt. (we are 200 miles apart) When I told the CSR that I could not wait that long and I was going to have to rent a machine she was very sorry, but offered no other solution. I called the closest authorized repair person (100+ miles away)and they put a pump belt and brush belt in a regular size envelope with 88 cents in stamps and I got it the next day. Now why couldn't Bissell do that?Long story short. Deal with changing the belt and it still won't spray. The belt is moving beautifully. I come to this site and find out not spraying is a proverbial problem with this machine. What a waste of time, money and energy....and I still have to rent a machine."
1,1699 Series Carpet Cleaner,"How I wish I had checked these reviews out before I wasted money buying this! The second time I tried to use it, would not spray, that should have told me something. Sent it back for warranty, they fixed it but never gave answer to what the trouble was. I only have 2 rooms with carpet and live alone, so not used much. Guess what, started to clean today, no spray again. Well going to town to buy another but you can bet it want be a Bissell product. Wasted money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I am writing a review because this product is just horrible. I read the other reviews and bought one because some of the people had good experiences with it. I can not urge you enough to avoid this cleaner!!!! TRUST ME! You will SAVE money going with a better brand. The guy at the repair shop I had to take mine to because it never worked told me to send it back rather than repair it. He took me in the back and showed me at least 30 of the same model that had all been brought to him for repair. He told me that Bissell and Hover are both bankrupt and these products are always breaking down. He told me to go with a Dirt Devil model that runs around $250.00 if I didn't want to go high end with my purchase. Please trust me!! I gave it a chance but after mine didn't work and I saw ROWS and ROWS of them at the repair shop, I felt I had to leave a review to warn other potential buyers. DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!! I had to give it one star in order to post this but it doesn't deserve it!"
4,Did wonders with stubborn pet stains!,"Out of desperation I bought this to clean my carpets before my parents' latest visit. My sweet old cat was never very particular about where he relieved himself, so the carpets in my hallway had become a mess. On top of that, I had stained several areas of my house with foot traffic and dropped food in the year since the steamer guys last took me for [money]. This machine works well, and is MUCH easier to use and clean than my old Bissell Little Green... So check it out! The only drawback is that it left behind several blobs of carpet fuzz and cat hair, even though I had just vacuumed before shampooing. But if you vacuum a second time after the carpet dries, you'll be home free!"
5,A great product!,"After months of carrying Leap Pad books and cartridges around in plastic baggies, I took the plunge and purchased this organizer. I'm so glad I did! My 3 year old finally loves keeping her Lead Pad things organized. There is plenty of room for lots of books and cartridges. The zipper is easily manipulated by little fingers.Finally - no more incessant searching for a cartridge!"
2,Disappointed....,"At first this case seemed like a good idea, but after the 3rd use, the zipper broke. Since the case does not stay open on its own, there is tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart. After fixing it a couple of times, it is now permanently broken. Bad design. Maybe Velcro would have been better."
3,Little ones will have trouble with this,"While I love the fact that this storage case holds 14 books and cartridges plus the leappad easily, my children have a terrible time getting them in and out of the case themselves. I have to help them with each step and that is really annoying. The case does not open flat, it constantly wants to close on itself, even with the weight of the books and leappad. I wanted something that would make my life easier but I am still left cleaning up the books and cartridges myself because the children just can't do it. Plus, when full the case is very heavy to lift. My children can but I worry that they might injure themselves (dropping the case on their feet)."
1,Not a good buy,This product sucks if you only have the leappad. It's as big as my 4 year old. Don't buy it because if you don't like it you have to pay postage to return the monstrosity. Leappad finally came out with a smaller version of a case. Hopefully it will be better than that big piece of purple junk.
3,Waiting for the volcano to blow,"The obvious comparison is to Robert Stone and Graham Greene. Alright, no problem. If you're going to ""borrow,"" might as well borrow from the best. But the author expends too much energy on trying to impress the reader with the quality of his prose and not enough on characterization. I'm impressed, however, with the scope of his knowledge oncultural matters relating to the Carribbean -- he obviously knows his subject. A good book, but next time, Bob, lighten up on the literary pyrotechnics. Go back and read G. Greene and you'll be reminded how simply and eloquently he states his case."
2,Great start then all downhill,After a hilarious opening chapter its all downhill. A long long road with not much to see along the way. I reread the first chapter often and have had many others do the same
5,Great book for Baby Boom Generation - Keep dictionary handy,"Great book about politics in the Caribbean and relationships with 'voluptuaries"" in sun ripen ""decrepitude"""
4,The Next New World.,"""Swimming in the Volcano"" follows in the brilliant footsteps of Graham Greene's library. This book is full of lush prose and novel metaphors, on top of a thought-provoking and involving story. By the way, you may want to have a dictionary nearby."
4,"Searing, Paradoxical, and Riveting","Outstanding work of art. If you are interested in living a life of superficiality, than don't bother seeing this. Otherwise, check out this indie gem that will keep you thinking for some time."
3,Riveting and Quiet Documentary,"It is slow paced and makes you reflect deeper about ""marriages"" and contemplate about the factors which necessitate the institution. Is is worth it to just stay in a ""functional"" marriage and yet, not be fulfilled?"
5,51 Birch Street,"This is a personal documentary of an adult son chronicling his parents' married past after his mother unexpectedly dies. His mother and father were married for just over 50 years and during filming he comes across his mother's diaries which explain in great detail how unfulfilled and unhappy both she and her husband were during their time together. Life then takes another unexpected turn when his father suddenly gets in touch with an old secretary then marries her after 3 months and decides to pack up and move to FL (lol).51 Birch Street is very moving and the documentary takes its time explaining (or trying to explain) the sad but interesting dynamics that took place in the marriage of these two people. I love a good, poignant documentary and this one was very good."
3,Ok but could be better.,This project kit is ok.Everything works and the kit is well designed. The book is big and has good graphics but it really doesn't tell you much about electrons. You sort of end up just learning how to read a schematic and building some pretty lame products. I don't like to be negative but really if anyone is out there like I was I think before you spend eighty dollars you may want to reconsider what you're looking for. Are you looking just for a project kit to start to have a very basic idea of electronics? If so this kit is good for that but the price seems high for just that.
4,Perhaps the wrong approach,"Mr. Baumann's comments on this site are right on target, but there is one point of view that needs to be voiced. Why bother with a reconstruction at all? In listening to ""Turandot"" (say) I always hit the Stop button when Puccini's music ceases. In the case of ""Rodrigo,"" the plot is not so compelling that the public is panting for a complete version. Would it not have been far better simply (or complexly) to record those parts of the score that do not call for flights of imagination and borrowings from the composer's other works? Giving a stage performance is one thing, making a recording another. I am grateful for that part of the work that is Handel's. The trouble is I can never be sure in listening what part that is, except for the instances given in the notes that come with the libretto. Perhaps the producers would consider a single CD without the tiresome recites of just those parts that are undoubtedly authentic. Merely a Modest Proposal."
4,There is always room for more 'Harry',"The untimely death of Harry Chapin robbed us all of the opportunity of hearing Harry sing in person (I only saw him perform in concert, once, in Glasgow, the year before his death. As a result, we fans grab every opportunity we can to hear 'new' Harry songs. I bought 'Storyteller' and 'The Last Protest Singer'(also from Amazon) at the same time and I am more than pleased with both. Apart from the joy they bring, these albums have also inspired me to revisit all of Chapin's other works.I admit to being a completeist and as such, Storyteller is a welcome addition to the Chapin canon.."
3,A good introduction to Melville's works,"Although this book should not be called a complete volume, it is rather a collection of Melville's writings, it provides a enjoyable and interesting introduction to one of the most impressive american writers of the 19th century. It contains a real classic - the novel Moby Dick - and some novellas from The Piazza Tales, such as ""Bartleby, The Scrivener"" (in my opinion, Melville's masterpiece), ""Benito Cereno"" and ""Billy Budd, the Saylor"". There is at least a big surprise inside: the essay ""Hawthorne and His Mosses"", a text from the youth, but full of insights about Melville's friend, Nathanael Hawthorne. A fantastic gift, like most of Library of America editions."
3,Smells!!!!,"This dumbbell looks well made, but it really gives off a strong unpleasant odor. It will make your entire room smell. I've only had it 2 days. I hope the smell eventually fades.Update: 2 weeks later and it still has a very strong smell. I have to leave it outside."
3,quck question,i love how they are exactly the ones i want to get but i have a quick question....do i get both dumbbells or is this just for one of them?
2,"Heats great, but the ""click, click, click"" drove everyone insane","The consistant ""click, click, click"" is too annoying and wakes people up at night. I purchased two of these new, and it is two of these that I am giving to Goodwill. They do, however, heat well."
3,poor switch placement,"I have had this heater for about 2 years. It works great, however, the placement of the controls was not well thought out. I have small children and pets and frequently find that they have been able to easily alter the settings due to the location of the high/low heat switches. They are very easy to step on accidentally for both people and animals. I have now found a place to put it that this is not so much of a problem, but it's something to consider if you are going to purchase this item. Other than this, it works great."
5,Safe and Reliable Heater,"(I edited this on November 28, 2009) I bought 2 of these heaters, 7 years ago. Our home is less than 1000 sq.ft. We don't use any other form of heat except for these two heaters. They don't instantly heat the home. However, it doesn't take very long for them to do their job. Once the area is warmed, the heaters maintain the temperature perfectly. I think this was one of the best purchases I've ever made. I highly recommend these heaters and this brand name."
2,a disappointment for fans of samantha brown.,"samantha brown should stay away from europe. it is not her turf. her asian travel videos are far more entertaining than this one in europe. her personality does not fit the aristocracy, boredom and laid back atmosphere of europe. her vibrancy is fitted well to the asian culture. watch her asian travel videos and you will see the difference. the europe travels are boring and too slow and showed mostly old building of yesteryears compared with the vibrancy and progressiveness of asia."
5,A matter of taste,"Whether or not you enjoy Samantha Brown is very much a matter of taste. My daughter and I were discussing this and agreed that Brown points out some of the meaningful things to do in each city and warns her audience about some of the touristy things, all the while keeping her show entertaining. I've been to Brussels, Amsterdam and Barcelona, and thought she did a terrific job with them. Of course I could whine that she didn't mention the fantastic art museum in Brussels, or the amazing museum of musical instruments; I could be horrified that she said not one word about the fantastic Parc Guell in Barcelona. But why complain when Brown has whetted my appetite for the enjoyment of a place. Perhaps the test for me is her show on Prague: I've never been there. By the time she was five minutes into her tour of Prague, I couldn't wait to buy a Fodor guide and start planning a trip there.My usual travelling companion swears by Rick Steves; I get nothing out of him. A matter of taste..."
5,Beautiful and Inspiring,"This is the best version of Kullervo I have heard. So beautiful, this powerful opus will stay in your memory and on cold winter days will inspire you and give you strength."
4,Fine recording,"This and the ones by Berglund are all fine, have not heard Salonen.Playing is fine. My main problem with the work is that it takes me 3 sessions to finish the whole thing. I give 4 stars to the work. It ranks below the symphonies and also Lemminkäinen for me. On the other hand, it is one of his better vocal works.Singing is fine also, I can make out the lyrics. Take some time to listen, it has plenty to offer. I would like to see it live some day."
3,You get what you pay for,"This vacuum is fine for picking up the dirt in a small studio, but don't expect anything more from it. The main problems are by design: It is not very powerful (but adequate for hardwood floors) and because the engine is on the stick you can't reach under beds and sofas. But it does the job nicely in a small place with no rugs."
4,I love this vacuum,My apartment has all hardwood floors and I have a very furry dog. This vacuum has made a huge difference in keeping the place clean. It does a great job picking up the long hairs and has been a real time saver. Plus it's hard to go wrong for this price.
3,Excellent release with one major glaring flaw,"I've been looking forward to this release for a very, very long time, and it's almost everything I wanted. The packaging is good, the video and audio quality is good, and the show, of course, is excellent.However, Sony, for some reason I can't begin to understand, did not give an English subtitle track for the Japanese audio. They instead have basically captions for the English dub track, which is close in meaning - but only close. If I wanted the English-dub dialogue I would be watching the English dub, but since I'm watching the Japanese audio I want a translation of what they're saying.Based on this I'm very uncertain if I'll bother to buy part two of the series. I almost wish I could return this set, because the discrepancy between what I'm hearing and what I'm reading is VERY distracting.If you're going to watch the English dub, by all means, buy this set. But if you want to watch with Japanese audio, I would really recommend avoiding it."
3,"Different, Interesting, Good","This anime was good - not quite as dark, artistic or intense as Blood the Last Vampire - but still good. The story and set up are interesting and the characters are fine.The English dub isn't terrible, but it has it's moments. The subtitles are a let down. I hope that another edition will be released with complete subtitles rather than dubtitles."
4,Blood,Product arrived with worn packaging & obviously opened yet dvds were fine. Unexpected T shirt in new condition. Product itself is great entertainment.
2,Blood minus,"The fact that it's a great story saves it from a one star rating. Inferior (to the Japanese) voicing and dub titles instead of subtitles detract from this excellent series. I've seen a subtitled version, and it makes Sony's choice of dubtitles rather than a more accurate subtitle translation greatly disappointing."
1,Do not buy this................! -Jult Warfell,Between this and Blood + part 2 I lost over 600 + minutes of my life having to watch this crap. What a waste of time for dub talented actors. Jult Warfell
3,"A great anime, disappointing Dub-titled","I was really looking forward to this DVD Box release... Blood Plus being one of my favorite series. However having seen Blood before (english sub before Sony picked up the show), watching this release now is painful many times over each episodes as the subtitles are taken form the english dub version and at times is ridiculously way off.Dub-titles are a rip off. I can't believe they did that."
3,"Blood, blood everywhere","Based loosely on the anime movie Blood: The Last Vampire. I thought this TV series was superior to the movie only in that here, the director had time to evolve a story. It was engaging and fun, well worth the watch."
2,"""Improvements destroyed it""","I've used PrintMaster for years. The old versions were simple, intuitive, and produced excellent results. Their latest ""upgrade"" is a disaster. It seizes up my computer, has NO online support (not that I can get to, anyway), and it is simply inexplicable. For example, why does the template for business cards have dotted lines that actually print out?Don't buy this!"
1,Worthless,This is the most worthless peace of software I've come across in a long time. I've had Printmaster Premier for over 10 years and it's better than this. It's extremely slow in clip art searches and most of what is there can be found for free anyway with Google and a lot faster. If I could take it back I would. I even had to run my computer in safe mode just to install it. So far every project that I've started with this I've given up on and used other software. IT WON'T MAKE YOUR LIFE ANY EASIER.
1,I would rate it ZERO if i could,"I couldnt even get this garbage installed before it started locking up my computer.Whoever created this mess ought to be forced to go to every household that bought this p.o.s. and get it to run.Almost everytime i have installed new software,it autoruns and the installation wizard makes things easy.Installing this program makes one feel like they need to be a programming expert just to follow the directions.I cannot believe that a company would release something this complicated and difficult.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Very bad product,I bought it in Mexico!!! .... Sam's is selling it (thanks sam's) To bad I couldn't rate it 0 stars.... it is not for a spanish windows!!! It doesn't work at all.
2,Barely does the job,I bought PrintMaster Gold 16 over the holidays in order to make a calendar for my parents but encountered the following 3 problems: 1) the crop function had a glitch and didn't work correctly (cropped my work at a different angle from what I'd designate); 2) I couldn't connect to the online graphics (at Broderbund.com) for 2 whole days and still can't -- keep getting an error message saying sorry for the inconvenience; 3) when tried to connect with online trouble-shooting assistance I got a message stating that the server was down.I was able to pick off enough graphics from the enclosed CD to finish my calendar but next time I'm going with a different software program!
1,Product locks up and does not work,"I purchased this product to upgrade my older versions of Printmaster Gold 4.0 and Silver 10. The product has the same format as Silver 10, but locks up when you change fonts. The computer then has to be rebooted. The projects folder also jams up, putting card and posters, business cards, etc. into the wrong categories and mixing up the titles. This never happed in my other versions. I think there are MANY bugs in this product."
3,blast from the past,"You couldn't get all these disco greats without buying a dozen+ CD's, and that's a great plus. On the other hand- these are not the originals. All the hits are redone by a group I haven't heard of- and while they do a pretty good job of imitating some of the classics, sometimes it needs the original."
1,Get the words right,"I have no issues with a compilation of songs sung by other people, but please get the lyrics right!!!"
2,slow and tedious,"Ugh. Interesting plot that was poorly executed. As others have pointed out, the main character is ridiculously naive and we are forced to endure page after page of her efforts to convince herself of whatever incorrect hypothesis she cooks up next. Usually, it has something to do with rationalism of her spouse's unacceptable behavior and pinning responsibility on some fairly stereotypical bad guy. I liked the Christian message but discussions about this also dragged on interminably. A really good edit job would do wonders. I would have been very disappointed to have paid for this book as is. Luckily, I downloaded it for free on my Kindle."
3,great premise couldn't finish it,"The book started out really well and I inhaled the first 300 pages but then it just started to drag. It took so long for so little to happen, plot-wise. I found it to be predictable at points and therefore a bit of a let down compared to other's rave reviews. I didn't want to waste anymore time reading a book that I had lost interest in."
2,Cross Fire,"This book was enjoyable aside from the occasional underhanded remark about Catholicism. Jeannette Windle demonstrates her misunderstanding about Catholic Christians through her characters' misunderstanding and superstitions. She never offers a single Catholic character who tries to live the Catholic faith. The Catholic family lies, steals, bribes, grows and processes cocaine, do not help the poor, eventually resort to murder, and think a cross is a lucky charm. On the other hand, the several non-Catholic Christian characters are all equated with goodness, holiness, and charity. It would have been better if she had just left out any references to the Catholic Church. It wouldn't have hurt the plot at all, and she wouldn't have demonstrated her bias and her lack of knowledge."
4,Very hard to put down,"At the beginning, I found Sara's naivete annoying. Then again, she was in college and I am almost 40. With patience and perseverence past her innocence and I actually found myself unable to put this book down. This rarely happens and I am very critical. :-) The writing was easy and not exactly awe-inspiring - but the story was interesting enough to keep me engaged until the end. Gosh darn - I only wish I could find my own Doug Bradford! ;-)"
1,A DISGRACE TO A GREAT SINGER!!!,"Ella Fitzgerald has been called 'The First Lady Of Song.' And that title is fitting. Her voice was beautiful and very mellow. There isn't a lyric Ella can't sing. She's that good.Madacy Records has been issuing artists like Billie Holiday and Freddy Fender CDs in their 'Golden Legends' series. They take 14 or 15 of their best songs and put them on one CD for a special low price. Sounds excellent, right?Wrong. The sound quality on this CD is terrible. This does Ella no justice at all.Do yourself a favor and buy 'Pure Ella' or '20th Century Masters.' The sound quality on both is simply incredible, and you can really appreciate Ella. But avoid this one at all costs.Not recommended."
5,"A must have sosurce of information for the serious brass muscian,","In ""Brass Playing Is No Harder Than Deep Breathing"", Mr. Gordon has done an excellent job of describing the physical techniques used in brasswind playing. This book is an invaluable source of information for anyone playing a brass instrument who wants to improve their sound."
5,Great cover! Oustanding arrangements! Top quality live sound,"Just sit down in the sofa, pump-up the volume, close your eyes, and you'll spend an unforgettable relaxing moment with Steve and co! It's a pretty great professional live session, with perfectly balanced instruments. Simply, you'll love it!"
4,Incorrect song listings,"I just purchased this disc, and on the outside liner notes, it only lists nine songs on disc one, when in fact there are twelve. The other oddidy is the booklet enclosed consists only of pictures, with NO information as to the date or location of the concert. My copy is the domestic version on the Snapper label. Other than that, the disc is great."
4,The real spirit of Genesis went with Steve Hackett!,"If ever there was proof that Genesis lost their way with the departure of Steve Hackett this album is it. A mix of original Genesis tracks, with subsequent compositions by Steve Hackett plus offerings from Ian MacDonald and John Wetton make this a great album. Furthermore, for a live album its largely flawless (although a couple of the distorted vocals don't quite come off -hence only four stars). Five superb musicians displaying their art to the max!Compare this with Genesis' Archive #2 and you can see where they went wrong and what is missing from that box set. Power to your elbow, Steve Hackett!"
2,A disappointing live album,"Its a great idea - several major players from the progressive rock pantheon get together and perform live versions of classis songs from genesis, king crimson, and asia, as well as sone compositions of their own. Unfortunately, The Tokyo Tapes doesn't live up to its potential. Instead we get ""by the numbers"" performances. In fact, most of this two CD collection sounds like studio cuts with added crowd noise. The Tokyo Tapes isn't a complete failure - there is, for example, a nice version of ""In the Court of the Crimson King"" (and a ""hidden"" version of ""I Talk to the Wind"" at the end of the first CD), but all in all you'd be better off with Genesis Live (the Peter Gabriel version of the band) or any of the numerous live King Crimson offerings."
