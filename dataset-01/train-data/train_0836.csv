4,clark kent glasses,"These were for a halloween costume and they did the job. They fit a little small for an adult head, and my ears were sore by the end of the night, but otherwise they worked as I expected."
4,Ok for costume glasses...,"I purchased these glasses to complete my husband's Clark Kent costume for Halloween. The seller was excellent and they arrived as promised. However, I think the manufacturer should have made the lenses a little more durable because before we even took the glasses out of the package, the lenses were already scratched. Luckily my husband could still see out of them.You'll really like these if you're into the *new* Superman movie, they're based on the *new* Clark Kent's glasses - not the Christopher Reeve one. I think I would've preferred the old style... but I'm a BIG Christopher Reeve fan. My husband liked them just fine, so I gave them 4 stars for *Fun* quality."
3,Mild mannered super geek.........,"These glassed are grt8!!!.....The scratched Lens suck!!!....They were shipped fast and the order was complete....however........the lens on every pair was scratched...some glasses didnt even have the original packaging on it..It was the best price on the net oonsidering some pairs else where were selling for $7.99......Be super geek, super kool....and look like a chic fool with these glasses......"
5,Holloween?,If your looking for a holloween gun for a pirate outfit this is it. your gonna need a little brown and gold paint lil imagination I posted a picture of what i did and i guess it was just a lil to real to allow as a toy.
1,China crap,Paid little for this gun. Shot it four times and the trigger broke. Made in China says it all! I would say look for something that costs a little more money. You always get what you pay for when it comes to buying Made in China.
3,Keeps you guessing!,"A movie with just enough action, and a spice of romance, to keep both the guys and their lady friends involved in the story. My favorite character was the young FBI Agent investigating his first bank robbery. And I liked the chemistry between the two main characters, James Spader and Leslie Stefanson. (A lady's perspective, but hey, it made watching an action thriller more interesting!)."
1,Minus 10 stars! What a lousy lousy movie!,"Just finished watching this lousy movie. So bad, so unwatchable! Have to use Fast Forward to get to the end. The screenplay writer should be forever banned from writing one more of this kind braindead .... It's a shame to waste Spade and the other guy who played the divorced cop in the small town, since they are both supposed to be good actors. Jesus, what a horrible movie. Don't waste money and time on this ... movie."
4,Great Plot Twist/Fine Acting but oh soo low budget,"Kind of in the genre of movies like Memento and Mulholland Drive that deliberately set out to mislead the mind but not quite as complicated so that you feel you should have been able to have caught on a little sooner if you had only paid more attention - see if you can if you do watch. The witty dialogue between James Spader and female lead Leslie Stefanson is full of sparks that makes this a nice gem. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is entirely due to the low budget cinematography, otherwise its miles better than the [stuff] that usually gets top billing these days."
4,James Spader makes this a good movie,"The script evolves into a good movie. The acting is on and off, but James Spader is the real stand out here. If you're a fan of his, you'll love it. If not, you may get bored half way through it, although the third act twist is a good one. If you're into independent films or low budget ones like I am, then you will be used to the holes and character gaps that appear from time to time."
2,The Stick up - instant video version,"This gets two stars for FULL SCREEN instant video version. I can't believe I didn't notice before I paid to download this. Lots of great reveiws.... but they're for the DVD. The instant video version is FULL SCREEN, which means it's heavily cropped on the sides on a HDTV. I'm sorry, it was unwatchable on my TV. Very disappointed."
3,Great game with its own flaws,"This is a great game. I will stay there. It requires all kinds of thought and mastery of military strategy. Overall the game looks amazong, and the blood & gore is second to only Soldier of Fortune.This game's downfalls however made it nearly unplayable. The game runs absurdly slow on my system, which is currently a 533 mhz system. This really makes for an awful experience. One you get to the later levels, you will have more load time than play time.I really recommend this if you have a smoking system, it really is great, however, if you run less than a 533 mhz, you are not in for a treat."
4,"Detailed, organized, contains tons of practice.","This book is the most detailed one among all SAT II Math review books. Topics covered in this book are classified so as to give an idea on which tests they are likely to appear. There are 10 practice tests different from the ones previously published by the same author, useful graphing calculator techniques, many solved examples and a lot of exercises each of which has its answer at the back. The topics are explained in an excellent manner, for instance the topic entitled ""advamced graphing of transformations"", or trigonometry that is explained in a very logical sequence. I do reserve my one star though for the figures could have more resulution."
5,Excellent prep material for Math 1 and 2,This book is the best because of many reasons: First of all it covers every topic likely to appear in SAT Math 1 and 2 in a detailed and highly organized manner. A person who uses this book will be prepared for every kind of problem that can appear on the test day and the real test cannot be harder than what one will see in this book. This book is the one that must be used when a perfect score is desired. The examples are very carefully chosen and presented in such a way that the reader will caprure every detail with no difficulty. The author uses the Texas Instruments graphing calculator techniques whenever necessary. In every way this book is prepared for the end user and promises great success. The only weakness of this book is its price and the author must find a way out to solve this problem. Nevertheless this book is the best and definitely better than all of the other prep books.
5,"If you love the series, you need to get","Blu-ray so high def right? Cartoons don't have a noticeable difference to me on blu-ray, but whatever, i guess it probably is considerably improved since this series is pretty old. This is arguably not the best season, but probably at least the second best. This is my favorite anime of all time, and a must buy."
2,I didn't feel anything different.,I used these with an open mind and I do not feel like they did anything for me. When you see the dark grime on the bottom of these alot of people don't realize it is the tourmaline doing that not the toxins coming out of you. It may work and I just didn't know it but I didn't feel it either way.
3,"Well, I Loved The First Two-Thirds...","THE CRIMSON RIVERS starts out w/ a gruesome jolt, when an eyeless, hand-less corpse is discovered. Jean Reno (THE PROFESSIONAL) is excellent as the commissioner, and Vincent Cassel (IRREVERSIBLE, BIRTHDAY GIRL, EASTERN PROMISES) is equally good in his role. For the first two-thirds of the film, the tension builds along w/ the mystery. Everything seems to be on course for a classic, dark thriller. Then, in the final third, the proverbial wheels fly off! It's as though the film-makers were in a rush to get to the end, so they could have an explosive finish. Any / all suspense is replaced by a ""plot twist"" straight out of Hollywood! So, what began as a grisly thriller, veers -hopelessly- off into cheeezy ""action"" territory, complete w/ CGI avalanche! I half expected Sylvester Stallone to pop up from behind a snowbank! Ugh!.."
4,It's O.K.,"I like Reno in most movies and thats why I bought this one, I don't think it is as good as some say on here, but it is very entertaining, one problem was the English translation was way off, it may not mean much to some but to my wife it was hard to follow..and then the end was sorta a farce,, certainly could of ended better with more reality."
4,weird ending but great entertainment and great location shots,"This movie is fast paced but not a cheesy one-not action thriller. The scenery is AMAZING. The story was quietly weird despite the opening CSI-type scene. I forgot I was watching a French film because I got caught up in the mystery and the action. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel. The two actors are key to the entertainment value of this movie. Vincent Cassel looks like an Irish guy I went to school with, a lanky pugilist."
2,Very Disappointing--They Gutted a Great Book!,"I know it isn't wise to compare films to the books that inspire them, but in this case, I must. I'd been looking forward to this film ever since I read the book by Jean-Christophe Grange and read Roger Ebert's wildly enthusiastic review. That's why the actual experience of viewing the film was such a disappointment. They took a riveting book and threw out so much of what made it memorable, that the resulting film doesn't make a whole lot of sense (if you watch the documentary included in the DVD, wherein the writer and director talk about some of the changes, you'll get a sense of just what's missing). The reason a film like _The Silence of the Lambs_ was so successful was because the screenwriter and director had such respect for the book it was based on. _The Crimson Rivers_ bears very little resemblance to its source material and it is all the weaker for that very reason. All I can say to those who're raving about this film is: READ THE BOOK!"
3,extreme simplified!,"ok perfect camshots and effects that worth watching but jean reno's and vincent's outstanding play ain't enough to save the film 'cause the scenario has been too much simplified when comparing with author-Grange's book. Well, to tell the truth, i'm a bit disappointed with the film anyway it was gorgeous to see Jean Reno again after his stunning play with ""Leon or The Professional""Cagri/Istanbul-TURKEY"
3,looks good but doesn't satisfy,"Reno is always a pleasure to watch, but this run of the mill serial killer film holds no surprises."
3,Good but predictable,"This was a nice book, but very predictable. The characters fall in love within hours(literally), White shield tries to help Janice find her lost brother and adopted daughter(which is really sweet),and that is the entire book. Although there is not much to it, Savage Devotion was well written(technically). I recommend this book for a ""not-in-depth"" read, and for relaxation."
5,A great book (as usual),"I really enjoyed this book, Cassie Edwards is my favorite author, along with Rosanne Bittner, however I haven't found any new books by her, maybe you cab tell me why, or where to look? Thanks"
1,Savage Predictability,"Ordinarily I really enjoy a new Cassie Edwards novel, but this one really falls flat. Not only do the characters not particularly endear themselves to the reader, they ""fall in love"" much too easily, and from there, the story becomes so painfully predictable that this novel quickly goes from being a so-so paperweight to a wallbanger and doorstop. What a good romance needs is conflict - and there is no real conflict between Janice and White Shield, making their story flat and uninteresting.What the ""Savage"" series needs is either to die off quietly or some new, fresh ideas. Infusing a novel with historical information about the various Native American tribes is simply not enough to keep this slowly sinking boat afloat."
2,What's With the Dialogue?,"Who wrote the dialogue in this book? Are we sure this novel was written by the author who gave us Gone, But Not Forgotten and the Burning Man? Does he have a child in middle school who perhaps came upon the manuscript and decided to have a bit of practice? And where was the editor in all this? I expected so much more from this author."
1,What a disappointment!,"I was disappointed because I very much enjoyed another Margollin book, ""The Burning Man"". This plot was very contrived and pretty silly when you thought about the amount of work that had to go into the criminal mastermind's plot to kill her husband and get away with it. Fret not! She is caught in the end.Don't waste your time"
3,The Undertakers Widow,"It is about a woman whose husband gets killed in the middle of her campaign. She has the gun in her hand when the detective comes in. Her dead husband is lying in her lap with blood everywhere. The detective ends up believing that she did it, to get more publicity. He believes that she hired a hit man to kill him. At first his son believes this and tries to convince every one but they don't believe him until the evidence is obvious. This is a very thick book but the plot is very obvious and menus the explicit detail it wouldn't be a very big book."
2,First Margolin and Probably My Last,"I read this book because it is set in Portland, OR, where I am living. It felt like a book that was intended to be sold for movie rights -- lots of excitement and gratuitous sex and violence, and in 90 minutes maybe one might not see the flaws.And the flaws were many: the judges stupidity and then lack of ethics as he turned detective (at the end I wondered why he didn't sentence himself to 2 years in prison!); the Political Correctness of the author which gives away the ending; a cartoonish cast of characters; an ending that had me hunting for the book recycling bin."
3,A Fairly Good Legal Suspense Novel!,"To be exact, I would give this novel 3 1/2 stars. I liked the whole novel a lot. Good characters, great suspense, good action scenes and events. I felt that Phillip Margolin did a good job describing the scene of the courtroom in detail. But the thing with the novel that I didn't like is the ending. WHAT THE HECK WAS MR. MARGOLIN THINKING? The obvious bad guys who Margolin portrayed the whole way through would have been a much better choice for the killers than the one he picked. Very bizarre! So to sum up, the first 3/4 of the novel was great, but the ending could have been a lot better. But I will definitely give Phillip Margolin another try, because I loved Gone, But Not Forgotten."
3,"Likeable character, easy reading",I have always liked Margolin's style of writing and found this book enjoyable. The main character was very likeable and the book was easy to read. I finished it in 2 days and gave it to a friend. not Margolin's best work but not his worst either.
4,LAWYERS & JUDGES--WHAT TANGLED WEBS WE WEAVE!!!!,"Wham, right off the bat, Lamar Hoyt is killed. Now to find out who did him in. His widow is Ellen Crease, she is arrested and has a hearing. Did she kill him? Judge Richard Quinn gets involved as he hears the case. Benjamin Gage is running against Ellen Crease for Senator, did he hire someone to kill Hoyt and Crease or to kill Hoyt and cause Crease to take the blame? Judge Richard does a no-no with Andrea Chapman or is she Andrea Chapman? The book takes many twist and turns as the police try to find the killer. It will hold your attention. Some of the trial apperances drag on a little long. But wait, the ending will surprise you, it did me, but then I am not as swift on the pick up as some of the other reviewers. I have read several Margolin book and I like this one and ""The Burning Man"" better than any of the others, so far. If you want a book that will hold your attention, with lots of twists and a surprise ending, I think you will like this."
2,"Not awful, but very close.","This book give hope to all aspiring writers. If this kind of tripe can get published, anything can. The dialogue is so bad, it's embarrassing. There is not one believable character in the entire book. The plot twists make you wonder what Margolin was smoking when he wrote it. The book makes Dumb and Dumber seem plausible."
2,"A quick read for air travel, or waiting for baby to awaken.","Pulp fiction, tightly crafted, quickly paced, conveniently plotted with forty-eleven twists and that is one too many. I'll bet it didn't take more than six days to keyboard this cheap thriller, and only then because he added all the conceivable endings. A good read if you're looking for a page turner than doesn't matter, but if you read many mysteries you will predict the entire book after the first three chapters."
3,"Good plot twists, fair characters, OK story","This book was just OK, the story did keep me guessing for the most part, but there was one event with the judge that was so out of character for him that it kind of ruined the rest of the book. But, I guess the author had to make the story more interesting somehow."
3,i won't remember this book a week from now.,"Characters aren't consistent. The plot left some holes. It really didn't ""do it"" for me. I wouldn't recommend this book for friends... and if the ending was consistent with the opening chapter... Well, it would have been a completely different ending, wouldn't it? Maybe that was the point."
2,A big disappointment,"I have been an avid fan of Margolin's work. I enjoyed each of his previous novels, but I found this one to be a bit contrived. I almost wish he would have let the poor judge take his lumps, instead of the sappy ending we were forced to read. I anxiously wait for his next work, because I'm sure it will be an improvement over this novel."
2,would make a great light weight Matlock t. v. fare,"My wife and I are big Margolin's fan having read everything he has written. But, alas, his string has stumbled with this book containing too many characters, too many bullets and not enough of a believable plot to sustain worthwhile chair time at the beach. Methinks, Philip has ground this out to hurriedly and like fine sausage, contents are somewhat tasty but, we long for something better to sink our teeth into!"
4,GREAT BOOK!,"The Undertaker's Widow is a great book. I am new to this author, but his book kept me engaged and wondering what was going to happen next. Even when you think you have it figured out, there are special twists!"
4,widow,"This is a very interesting book about morals.How far will we go to protect our own.From the top of the food chain down ,who is really innocent.Good message to all"
4,A Unique Twist and Turn,"Power and greed are always good motives for murder. How could ex-cop, now senator, Ellen Crease be guilty of murdering her billionaire husband, yet all the evidence points to her?Her case lands in the newly appointed to homicide, Judge Richard Quinn's courtroom. He finds that he conflicted because he is a friend of the deceased as well as of the widow. It is then that the plot starts twisting and turning, challenging the reader to figure out who is the victim and who is the villain."
2,Undertaker's Widow,"This book reads like a movie of the week on the Lifetime channel. Veteran mystery readers will find the supposed ""twists"" in this story to be laughable. I did. The only good thing is that a friend lent me his copy. When finished, I promptly returned it and asked him to never recommend another book to me again."
3,Review by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"A bad guy broke into the home of wealthy Lamar Hoyt and his wife, Oregon state Senator Ellen Crease, killing Lamar. Ellen killed the bad guy. Was it a burglary gone wrong or was Mr. Bad a hit man? Who was he supposed to kill? Soon Ellen is arrested for murder--right in the midst of her campaign for the US Senate seat.Judge Richard Quinn gets the high profile case. He's just sentenced a former judge to jail and is under close scrutiny about this case. But his marriage is not in the best shape and a weekend in the Caribbean didn't help him. Now that he's back in Oregon, the island episode is back to haunt him to the point of being blackmailed to see that Ellen Crease is convicted.Who's behind the blackmail and the murders? It's a quick read that will hold your interest to the end. But how can a judge be so dumb?"
3,"Just light, fun reading","I found this book easy to ""get into"" and it also kept my interest. It made for good commuter reading on the train. I found the characters interesting, perhaps a little transparent at times, but I did want to finish the book to find out ""who did it."" I've read mysteries with a lot more meat to them, but I felt this book was light and fluffy, good for a hot summer's day read."
4,Great use of many characters,"I thought this was one of Philip Margolins' best books. I've read them all. He used his many characters masterfully, putting them in and out of interesting situation. This kept me on my toes and wanting more. I highly recommend this good read."
3,Not quite what I expected,"The guitar is a good size and looks like the pic, but three of the strings and the extra strings were plastic!"
2,This Is Just A Response To A Review Placed Before Me:,"There are many types of guitars. One of those types is a ""Classical"" guitar. This guitar has three steel strings, and three ""plastic"" strings. Some of the very best guitars in the world are made this way...so that isn't a criteria for this guitar being a bad product! (Though I've read that there are other reasons this particular guitar isn't a good purchase!) If you want all steel strings, you will need to purchase a ""steel string"" guitar, which is a different guitar than a classical...both being good guitars."
1,very bad...,I bought this guitar for my daughter. She didn't like it. Then I return the guitar to the seller. But they never refund my money back.
5,A Must Own,"The Good:- Authentic recipes (lots of them). Most of the dishes taste pretty good. The first dish I made was Gong Bao Ji Ding and it was delicious.- Very nicely written. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. Lots of great info and details about the ingredients and cooking method. The author also provides an interesting background for each dish. You can tell Dunlop is passionate about Sichuanese food.- Great organization (separated by Noodles, Appetizers, Meat, Fish, etc.)- No MSGThe Bad:- Lacks pictures. The pictures were great but I wish there were more. I had to use google to compare my results.Conclusion:Overall a great book and easily recommended. Despite the lack of pictures, I still have to rate it 5 stars because of the delicious recipes."
4,Land of Plenty: A Treasury of Authentic Sichuan Cooking,"Wonderful cookbook, my husband & I have become exteremly interested in Sichuan Cooking over the past few months and we were very excited to find a cookbook representing the Sichuan style of cooking. We love cooking with Sichuan Peppercorns and the ""Hot & Numbing"" style of cooking. The first recipe we tried was the Dry Cooked Beef, the recipe was very well written, easy to understand and the end product was yummy. I would recommend this book to any one who is interested in a wonderful and very interesting style of Asian cooking."
2,Good info but way too much oil and salt,"After making some of these recipes, I've come to the conclusion my interest in Szechuan dishes must actually be in Americanized versions of authentic Szechuan dishes. I am abandoning this book because the recipes are way too salty and way too oily for me. I discovered I am more interested in delicious healthy recipes than in the concept that the dishes are ""authentic."" The book does have interesting narrative and helpful information about ingredients and techniques. However, I am going back to the book I already owned (Mrs. Chiang's Szechwan Cookbook) which is more to my taste."
3,Land of Plenty: A Treasury of Authentic Sichuan Cooking,"I found this book to be average at best. What really troubled me was that certain recipes -- the one for Kung Bao Chicken immediately comes to mind -- bore little resemblance to the ones I obtained from the Szechuan Culinary Inststute. The SCI's recipe for Kung Bao Chicken produced a dish virtually identical to the dish served at ""Szechuan North"", one of the first Szechuan-style restuarants to open in NYC back in the late 1970's. The dish produced by the SCI's recipe also is very much like the Kung Bao Chicken served at Tony Hu's ""Lao You Ju"" in Chicago -- another authentic Szechuan redition of the dish. I know that there are no set recipes for most Chinese dishes -- they vary from chef to chef -- but this particular recipe, as well as the ones for Twice Cooked Pork and Chili Shrimp, caused me to question the book's content."
2,Not for me,"I love Szechuan and there doesnt seem to be much Szechuan in my current area and most of is 3, 4 or 5 on the list of the regional Asian cuisines that the restaurant claims they cook - i.e.its not really Szechuan and it is lousy. I'm a decent cook who makes a lot of Thai food and am happy to try new recipes that sound good.Based on the tremendous reviews, I ordered this book and a bag of Szechuan peppercorns and waited with excitement. Drum roll please...very disappointing. There are only a couple of recipes that seem appealing and it is frankly difficult to tell which ones might be good and which of the many specialized ingredients can truly be substituted without sabotaging the dish if it may have been good in the first place.The book seems rather academic and true to authentic Szechuan, which may be what some buyers need. It does not give me what I need to excited about particular recipes and feel I have what I need to execute on them."
2,How to build a watch..................,"Although well written it reminds you of the old adage ""ask an engineer the time and he'll tell you how to build a watch"". I was looking for more of a recipe book rather than a history of Sichuan cooking."
2,I'll Probably Return This One,"I live in a small town in a semi-rural area, so I can't really use this book. It has way too many special ingredients--things that I can't even seem to find online, let alone the fresh ingredients. On top of that, most of the recipes seem very fattening. I try to watch the amount of fat and starch in my meals, and Chinese cooking usually is pretty good in these areas. I was hoping for some soup recipes or reasonably low fat chicken recipes. But there are too many recipes here that I would never even want to try. I'm no expert on Sichuan cooking, but I am a fairly experienced cook. But this one is going back, I'm afraid."
3,"Very informative, in a non-visual way.","This is my first book by Fuscia Dunlop, and I will certainly buy others. It is well-organized, clearly written and sparsely illustrated. Since I like to read a book from cover to cover before trying to cook from it, I found this book to be both entertaining and informative. Unfortunately, the few color photos are clumped together (as opposed to being next to their respective recipes) leaving a vague feeling of uncertainty as to whether you want to try the recipe. Haven't seen her other books, but I hope that she used a good ""book designer"" for them.Anyway - well worth the money, and ""meatier"" than Jaden Hair, but she could learn some lessons from Ms. Hair on how present information."
4,Great book and a very good guideline,"I liked the way she writes quite a lot. It is a very personal book with lots of passion and memories, but not overly sentimental or talkative. I enjoyed reading her stories about foods, restaurants, and people. I tried many of her recipes, as I wanted to re-create some of the things that I ate at my favorite Szechuan restaurant in Minneapolis. Some worked really well (twice cooked pork and water-spice beef for example) but some did not work so well (dan-dan noodle and fish-flavored eggplant). But I think every cookbook is more like a ""guideline"" for serious cooks anywhere. I can change her recipes s to my taste, and her book is a great guideline for sure.(I have no idea what is ""authentic"" Szechuanese, though. I have never been there, and I have only eaten at three restaurants that claim to be ""Szechuanese"".)"
5,Great memories of Chengdu,"I have prepared many of the dishes found in this book and have been amazed at how close the flavors were to what I've experienced while living in Chengdu and other places throughout Sichuan province.The introduction discusses the development of Sichuan cuisine, also its traditions and flavors. Notes on cooking methods, equipment, and an extensive section on ingredients found in a Sichuanese pantry help to highlight the uniqueness of the gastronomical delights found in this region of China.The recipes are divided into the following sections:-Appetizers-Meat Dishes-Poultry-Fish-Vegetables and Bean Curd-Stocks and Soups-Sweet Dishes-HotpotThe book is complimented by the translation into Chinese (both characters and pinyin) of every dish's name and major ingredient found within."
3,Very good concept,"I love the idea of having a worshipful exercise program, but was hoping to find a program that I could tailor for a six-week group session. Also - I'm not happy about the inclusion of a bunch of blank journal pages. It seems a waste of space."
1,Did not like it,Does not mix well with smoothies we make for our kids. Turned clumpy. Ended up giving it away. Would not recommend. And we got 25 lbs of the stuff. I miss read the label for grams!!
1,Piece of junk,"I used it once and then went to use it the second time and had no power. I tried the battery, charger etc. I am returning it today. Hopefully it will be replaced by Tech Scale."
4,This bag rocks!,I was looking for a tank bag that converts to a backback and got one of these and could not be more pleased!Pros:Holds tones of stuff.Stays on the bike at high speeds.Looks great.Converts to a backpack easily via hidden straps.Perfect size on the tank of my VStrom.3 outer pockets for easy access stuff.Won't scratch you tank.Cons:The hemet holder hangs low when you have in on as a backpack and hits you in the butt when you walk.Zippers are lightweight and hard to grab with gloves on.Not waterproof.
2,"Great Color, Poor Quality and Price","The interior waterproof liner started peeling up within 2 months. I contacted Icon via email and was given the ""whoops, sorry! Thanks for supporting Icon!"" speech with no customer service follow up at all, even when I tracked down quality control via telephone. The color is adorable, a perfect bright pink, but I cannot use it any longer because it cannot be washed it due to the peeling liner.Not only would I not buy this product again, I avoid Icon altogether now.Too many good brands with warranties and quality workmanship exist to settle for a shoddy product. RKA luggage in CA makes custom packs in any of 30 colors, incl. pink, and they stand behind their products. They're $40 more, but WORTH IT!!"
2,Cool Bag But Does Not Last,When I got this bag i was very excited because it looked great on my bike and was easy to take on and off. After about 2 months of daily use (commuting to college) 1 backpack strap broke. Within 4 months both straps were broken and the interior lining was peeling away. Now i just use it as a tankbag and leave it on my bike 24/7 with raingear in it. This bag would be the best ever if it just had better quality construction.
5,Fantastic!,"The cover, showing a few profiles overlapping one another, really gives this book's idea: you can study human character by comparing one portrait to another.Granted, human nature is truly revealed in choices and actions, which a bust portrait cannot depict. Yet - there is a lot to be said for the fact that certain life choices and habits carve this person's face... The emotions that are behind their choices make certain facial expressions, which over time create distinctive muscle-tendon-bone structures...So, the face can be said to show not just certain inborn characteristic, but also the sum of this person's life choices, as traced by the emotional marks on their faces.This book is truly remarkable not just for artistic study (and as someone else said, the photography is superb!) but also for the study of human character.So happy to have this - truly valuable!"
4,Photo gallery of ancient Romans,"This is a highly browsable, enjoyable collection of photos of faces from Roman sculpture. It is not a museum catalogue and provides little textual description. The 120 plate photos themselves are artistically done (as opposed to being intended simply to document the sculpture). In Roman times, sculptures served a purpose similar to photographs today. Relatively few of the portraits are of identifiable people, but Cicero and Augustus, among others, are included."
3,runs small,ordered my normal bigger size and still to small. sent it back for next size up. will see how quick it comes. great quality.
2,NO QC by company,"First of all, it is not reliable in that it records spurious data points. An Example is an actual wind speed of less than 2 mph and it records a 44 mph data point. You must use only specific run of the mill AA batteries, no Max or + types. Obviously made in China with very poor QC, if any. Tech support not knowledgeable about product and do not understand how products actually work."
1,Save your money!,"I received the Lacrosse weather station as a gift. It started out working ok for about 4 weeks. Plagued by software and communication problems I do not recomend it to anyone. The tecnical support team is of little or no help.It all goes back to that old saying,you get what you pay for.A Very Dissatisified Customer."
1,Buyer be ware,I received a LaCrosse 2310 professional weather station for Christmas and have been examining set up options for my location.1) LaCrosse's product literature states it has a wireless range of 330 feet. In the manual it states the wireless range is within a 100 foot radius. When this discrepancy was brought to LaCrosse's technical support team they clarified by stating the range is 80 feet.2) LaCrosse's literature states the station is completely wireless. It is not. The rain gauge and anemometer both must be cabled to the hydro/temperature sensor.Because of site limitations I am returning the unit. Because of untruths in the company's literature on range and flexibility of installation I suggest buyers consider another brand rather than support a company who uses partial truths to promote its products.
3,Low Priced Unit,I have had the WS-2300 for about 7 years now. About 1 1/2 years after I got it the wind measurement part died. Then the temp/hydro part died.I bought replacements and they have worked so far.There appears to be two problems with the unit.1- The rain measurement seems to be a little lacking. It doesn't catch enough or report the full amount.2- Second problem is wind measurement. The cables used from the temp/hydro unit to the rain and also the wind unit are unshielded.You get spikes and glitchy data from this. The problem is because of RF and static getting into the unshielded cables. I solved this by replacing the cables with shielded cables. Problem solved!!I have used this weather station for reporting weather for several years and it tracks other official stations well.With a little care and maintenance it does a good job.
3,Very Scary,"I watched this movie when I was a child, and I had nightmares for many years almost every week. It stopped when I got older, and I can't wait to watch it agian when it comes on DVD. I think that I can handle it this time around."
1,ugh...,"I realize this is an older Disney movie but it was really bad. I have seen older Disney movies and most of them insert a bit of comedy in them and some even have a little suspense; however, this one fell flat. The acting appeared stiff to me and the pace of the movie was somewhat slow. The whole explaination as to why the child disappeared was lame...almost as lame as the special effects."
2,Disrespectful of Bette Davis talent.,"Bette Davis had a lot of good performances in her career, her long career. But as she grew older, she began to parody herself more often than desired. And never was it more obvious in ""The Watcher in the Woods"". Essentially, the movie doesn't quite tell anything in particular. We never really understand why this family moves into this house at the beginning, nor their motivation on doing so. Basically, this film has a goal of firghtening the audiance, but it never quite reaches its goal. All the clichés of the genre are cumulated in it. For example, when Bette davis comes to help the young girl from drowning in the lake under the three. It is really unpleasant and disappointing to see such a good actress in such a bad role. This old woman has nothing new to offer as a character. The grief of losing her, which is suppose, to have wounded her deeply, isn't never really shown clearly, except at the end. This movie is just plain old flat. That's all."
4,Worth the vigilance - in the darkling farrest,"Watch for those Eyes - Bette's - she's looking - are you? between the sheets? The Watcher is not always in the wood - I've seen this movie at least 3 times throughout my life and still have not quite figured out (let alone remembered) how it is 'resolved' at the end - and it doesn't matter - it's the Way, The Journey there, the tale told that grips and touches the watcher (on the couch) - having first seen this film in the movie theater when it came out (I was about 12), a distinct sense of nostalgia is there for me when watching it - (and back then, was in the movies with my 2 younger sisters - my Mother was shocked that Disney would make such a scary film... *G* my poor sisters... apparently had nightmares for days/wks. afterwards... *G*) I know I was damn frightened in the big, 'ole movie theatre in Toronto...Enjoy the slowness, the subtly growing puzzlement - a riddle whose answer only the Watcher knows (I keep forgetting it... )"
3,Fun for the Whole Family,"This movie is a bit intense for small children but an excellent choice for family night viewing. Mystery, suspense and a good time guaranteed. The ending is a bit hokey and leaves questions to be answered but all in all it is entertaining and worth the effort."
4,This was so scary...,"I haven't seen this film in a long time, but it will stand as one of the most frightening film experiences I ever had. I don't rememeber how old I was - probably around 8 - when I saw this, and it scared the pants off me. I distinctly remember the part when the younger sister names her dog and writes the name in the window - YEOW! And what about the scene at the river? And the climax was extremely unsettling. I didn't sleep well that night. An amazingly effective film, and I still give kudos to Disney for making it. A creepy creepy ghost story. Much stronger than ""Burnt Offerings"" or this director's own ""The Legend of Hell House""."
3,"thrilling, indeed....","i agree to previous reviews of that title, the only thing i wish was Bette's part was more important; because the other actors although quite good aren't on her level at all. a good thriller, but don't watch it too late at night...."
3,Cozy and odd horror movie...,"As a family movie Watcher in the Woods has a fun and cozy vibe about it. It never gets very scary, except for Bette Davis whose presence is probably most genuinely intense thing about the movie.The ending is awkward and a little anticlimactic, but mostly it's an enjoyable ride.It's a good movie, but if you love it or hate it really boils down to your age (good for most kids), or if you are an adult it depends on whether you want to be amused...or genuinely scared.In other words, fans of Saw might do well to stay away, but those who like other Disney horror/action like Something Wicked This Way Comes, should love it."
3,Wonderfully Enchanting,"Like a lot of reviewers, I saw this as a child with my mother. She was a horror fan so I got to see all the 80s thrillers in the cinema.This film still stands in my mind. It has a great atmosphere about it. The great Bette Davis stars and is as wonderful as always.It may look cheesy by todays standards, but they don't make movies like this anymore. An old fashioned ghost story without gore and violence. Just good creepy fun."
4,Spooky!,"This is one of my favorite Bette Davis movies from the end of her career. (The ones I like best are from the 40s and the 60s.) I love movies that are spooky because of suspense instead of scary because of blood and gore. The only things this movie suffers from, in my opinion, are Lynn-Holly Johnson's whiny voice and the ending, which was just a little bit too quick and easy for me. Having recently seen the alternate endings available on the DVD, however, I am pretty glad they stuck with the ending they did. It leaves a lot more to the imagination and it does make sense, even though I thought it was too simple. In comparison, it made for a much better conclusion.I wish they didn't describe Bette's character on the back of the box as mean and eccentric! In reality, this was one of the nicer characters she has played! We don't know what is going on with her character at first, and she is a bit mysterious, but you can totally tell she cares for the safety of the two young girls."
3,Early Disney attempt at PG-style fare is worth a look,"Creepy, subtle horror/mystery by Disney was a good attempt to produce more mainstream movies (as opposed to strictly kids' fare) back in the early 80's. Though, if you think about it, Disney was always pretty willing to include scary elements in both its animated and live-action movies, so this initiative really wasn't much of a stretch. The great Bette Davis lends additional credibility to this modest but well-crafted film via her fairly small but nicely-performed role as the grieving mother of a long-lost child. The DVD I saw included the two alternate endings described by other Amazon reviewers. They're interesting to see, but the ending attached to the film- though it IS somewhat abrupt- is probably the best of all the conclusions. The other endings spell out too specifically things (the nature of the Watcher, where he/she/it comes from, etc.) that are better left imagined or speculated about by the film's characters."
3,It scared me to death when I was nine!!!,"Picture: Seven little girls, strewn on the couch in pajama'd glory, eyes wide, faces frozen in suspense. Two girls on the end of the couch, popcorn unnoticed, terrified beyond their wits.I don't about the rest of the world, but for two best freinds at age 9, this movie was a life-changing event. For years after viewing this film, we could not stop retelling it over and over to relive the delightful chill. I gasped in horrer when my mother, unknowingly, bought me a large, round mirror for my room, just knowing that one day I would look into it and see a little girl gesturing for help. My friend and I wouldn't go into the woods even during the day, in a group. I still won't go into amusement houses."
2,mediocre acting with a sophmoric plot,"corny plot with hammy performances that even Bette Davis couldn't save. don't waste your money on this stinker, especially if you love scary movies!"
4,This is made by DISNEY?!?,"Ok this movie traumatized me as a 5 year old girl. I can't believe it was made by Disney. I used to have nightmares about it. Betty Davis is by far the scariest character in this movie, especially when you think she's going to drown Jan's little sister in the pond. Also the scene where they show how Karen died was freaky. I watched this years later in my twenties and it was totally corny and cheesy. There were even parts that made me laugh like crazy. Please parents, don't let your young kids watch this. This ain't no Disney Saturday Night at the Movies kind of deal."
5,Still creepy for all ages!,"Watcher in the Woods scared the willies out of me when I was young, and I remember it still being creepy in my teens. I want to report that it has stood the test of time and is STILL creepy in my twenties! Not only that, I watched this with five younger sisters-in-law, ages 11-16, and they loved it! It scared the youngest one so she hid under a blanket for parts, but in a good way! The good thing about this movie is that it manages to be really scary while still being clean--no blood, no gore, no swearing or nudity... The alternate endings on the DVD show that you can explain what happens in several ways, but the original leaves it somewhat to your interpretation, which is very effective. I would try to get the older DVD, as it was done by another company (not Disney) and is more objective about the making of the movie. I hear that the newer Disney version took out some of the extras, and it doesn't have the interviews with the cast that the older copy does."
4,Childhood Memories,"I saw this for the first time when I was 6 years old, and I remember how scary it was to me. Even watching it today as an adult, I get goosebumps at certain scenes. A must see for any Bette Davis fan or anyone who loves a good ghost story. I'm so glad it's on DVD now!!!"
4,Slumber Party Best,This film satisfies the best needs of the 1980s slumber party! I highly recommend it for a new generation of slumber party audiences. It is scary without gore or gratitutious violence. (And Bette Davis is in this film!) Perfect for pre-teen audiences.
4,"Not for the young ones, but good for a rainy afternoon.","Bette Davis gives her usual ""I know something you don't"" performance; Lynn-Holly Johnson is a scream (literally; it's her best line). Not enough of David McCallum as a normal Dad instead of a secret agent or pervert."
5,THIS IS A VERY INTENSE MOVIE!!!,"I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY COOL MOVIE. IF YOU WANT A SCARY MOVIE THAT WON'T GROSS YOU OUT, BUT KEEP YOU GRIPPING THE CHAIR THIS IS IT."
1,Not reading e-mail,I ordered this DVD one day and found out on the same day that this DVD will not be compatible with my DVD player. I e-mailed to cancel my order multiple times and had no answer. The DVD was sent about 3 weeks later and my Visa was still charged for the order. They don't read their e-mails.
4,forever!,"God, I have been looking for this movie forever. I saw it when I was 7 and didn't sleep for a week. closed my eyes through half of it. I havn't seen it in a video store since. I think I'll have to watch it again...."
1,boring.,not scary and boring. Maybe the stupidest movie i have ever seen. Pretty laughable. I would not recommend to any horror movie fans for sure.
5,Awesome childhood film,"I loved this film in the mid 80s and still loved it when I saw it again years later. Could not resist buying it, as I watch it enough! <3"
3,"Works, but there is crosstalk...","I'm using this balun as dual-stereo audio instead of composite video. That said, I don't think it should make a difference, as it is four channels of balanced analog signals that get tied to each of the four twisted pairs of Cat5e wire. It works, but I get crosstalk. eg, if you plug into channels red and blue, you'll hear those channels on green and orange on the other side.Note: This is sold as one balun, not a pair."
5,Great for kids *and* adults,"I must admit--I hate kids music. But we were Sippy Cups fans because they covered 'adult' songs like Bennie and the Jets, I Wanna Be Elated, Bike, and Dear Prudence. But they're original tunes on this CD are amazing! They hook you in so you'll turn it on whenever the kids demand it. And get to one of their concerts if you can, too. It's a great show with lots of kid action and interaction and they're a fabulous band live. Check out their web site at [...]. (BTW, until Amazon starts stockin this, you can buy the CD at CDBaby.)"
1,Beware the DVD translation,"I have read the other reviews and am absolutely puzzled how they knew so much about this film, because the film's translation into English is the worst I have ever seen. They could not possibly have been based on the DVD.It was impossible to watch the DVD: only a few words were translated for each scene thus leaving the viewer bewildered. The English is translated as though the translator only understood a few words, would put those down and them skip everything else that was said.Other reviewers make this film sound interesting. Alas, I will never know because my version is useless."
4,Good World War 2 Movie,I enjoyed Watching this period war Movie because it showed the war through a chez waiter who worked at various hotels and married a German Women.....
5,Great stuff!,"A coworker brought some of this tea to work last year. I liked it then, but found myself craving it recently. I tried some regular green tea and it just wasn't doing it for me, had to figure out that it was the brown rice that made it so craveable! Anyway, looks like none of my regular stores that carry tons of other teas have this kind. I bought a smaller box of a different brand on ebay but this 90 bag pouch from Amazon is a much better value and it's the same yummy tea. There's something very savory and satisfying about the flavor. Smells kind of like popcorn, tastes a little like that too. Great stuff!"
4,On the light side for rice flavor,"I was looking for a nice rice tea to enjoy in the winter months, and while quality wise this tea is rather good, I found I like a little stronger rice flavor in my tea, the green flavor slightly overpowers the rice flavor. I have tried seeping it longer than I normally would, and that helps but still doesn't deliver the flavor. I think I'll try another brand next time."
5,Love Yamamotoyama Genmai Cha Green Tea,I love this tea! I love the aroma of the green tea and roasted brown rice. It helps me to keep my weight under control and I like that each tea bag is packaged individually which keeps the tea bags fresh. Fast delivery. Will order again.
4,Great tea,"This is the only green tea I drink anymore, I make it daily or every other day. This 90 bag value pack was great for sharing with friends. Now they're hooked as well!Yamamotoyama also sells this tea in a box of 16 bags, and you can buy a 12-pack of those boxes on Amazon. For some reason, the boxed stuff tastes slightly better to me.Yamamotoyama Genmai-cha Green Tea with Roasted Brown Rice, 1.69-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)"
5,Genmai Cha in a convenient pouch,While in Japan we were introduced to Genmai Cha and immediately preferred the taste of green tean and toasted rice to plain green tea. Back in the states we found suppliers for bulk mixes until we stumbled upon the Yamamotoyama tea bags in foil pouches. Each serving is fresh and the flavor is great. We heartily endorse buying the 90 pouch bulk pack so you can have this great flavor at any time.
5,DELICIOUS TEA,My wife and I order this tea every couple of months. We have at least to 2 cups of this tea daily! It is delicious. The tea bags are individually foil wrapped for maximum freshness.
5,BEST GENMAICHA TEA,IT'S THE BEST BROWN RICE GREEN TEA IF YOU LOVE GENMAICHA TEA THIS THE BRAND YOU WON'T DISAPPOINTED
5,Very fast service,This product was received very fast.I ordered 4 pieces and was charged only 1 shipping and handling charge.
5,Good Review,"Very pleased with this order. The product received was the product advertised and was received in a very timely fashion (recieved before the estimated date of delivery). Based on this experience, with this vendor, I will not hesitate to do business with them again in the future."
3,Overnight Delivery,"This is a twisted love story, you don't know who you want to pull for the guy or the girl."
4,overnight delivery,"i watched the first fifteen minutes once,and it looked really boring and stupid.but then i saw the rest of it this morning,and loved it!"
5,"An enexpected surprise, this movie is great to watch!","Reese Witherspoon is good in anything, and with the combination of Paul Rudd, that makes this movie in the top ten of 1996!"
5,My favorite movie,"definitely something you should see before purchasing (it's broadcast on FX frequently), as this little movie is described as either abhorrently stupid or sublimely awesome, depending on who you ask.the plot is simple enough, and you have to believe the conceit - that Wyatt can't solve his problem with a simple call to his girlfriend - for any of it to work. but if you ever HAVE had a dilemma anywhere resembling this, the story resonates pretty well, and the kevin smith influence is obvious. HIGHLY recommended!"
3,A hilariously funny teen comedy,"If you are in the mood for a light movie from the same genre that brought you films like ""Better Off Dead"" or the more recent ""She's All That"", then ""Overnight Delivery"" is for you. Paul Rudd is great as Wyatt Trips and Reese Witherspoon is fabulous as usual as Wyatt's reluctant sidekick. In short, it's a good little film."
3,I love amazon,"The DVD got to my house no problem, however the movie isn't that great. My girlfriend loves Paul Rudd and I remember watching this movie on a lazy day in the dorm rooms, at the time it didn't seem as bad, those were the good ol' days!"
2,Didn't Age Well,"I recently watched this film, and while I did get a chuckle in a couple of spots I found it mostly ridiculous... but not in the funny way. Perhaps I am not the intended audience and I can admit that, or maybe it's because I am watching it so long after it came out. If you like over the top premises and absurdity and female prison films, go for it. I don't think I'll be watching it again, but don't take that as meaning ""I hated it""."
3,Unquiet Grave,"The CDs are both quite diverse in the music they present, but lack a certain something. Call it consistency, call it progession from one track to the next, I can't quite place it, but something came up missing for me. While some of the tracks are very, VERY good, those that are not worth the time aren't quite paid for by those that are."
1,Are you freaking kidding me? Not worth the plastic it's made of,This is possibly one of the worst most disappointing pieces of plasticated junk i ever played in my life....are all of you people that are giving this POS 4-5 stars just afraid to admit that you wasted your money and that this album sucks? Take my advice it does suck. Spend your money on some real goth music and let this thing lie forever and die in the landfill where it belongs...not worth your time or money. Uggghhh.
5,night vision rocks,"The night owl night odyssey is one of the best out there in my opinion it works like magic and it is easy to use. It's waterproof so you don't have to worry about getting it wet. When you turn the infared illuminator on, it's like there is a huge flash light that is scaning the object. It really works great."
1,Horrible text book,"If your professor chooses this book, plan on having a bad semester. This book was written by someone that knows chemistry, but lacks the skills of teaching. The example are poorly connected, worst case scenario-it took me an hour of plugging in different formulas and variables to arrive at the same answer."
4,good choice,perfect corresponding between the description and the real condition of the book. really satisfied for the purchase and for the rapid shipping!!
4,great cheap set,"The case in this set is probably worth half the asking price. The chips are not ""casino"" weight, but miles ahead of the interlocking plastic chips. My only complaint is that I wish there were more white or red chips and less green and blue. Overall a very good buy."
4,bargain buy,"The case lacks in aluminium, the chips are a little light, the card decks shouldn't be identical, the dealer button is a bit small. But importantly the chips and the case look professional enough for their price, the quality is acceptable for a home game, and it's cheap. I've already made up for its cost in my winnings against friends so this was a real bargain."
5,Excellent Quality,Replaced a pair of old banged up jacks on my Adcom GFA-545. These are excellent quality. I only wish they came with a small flat wrench to help tighten them up. These are worth the money A++++. Thanks Dayton
2,Overpriced,You'd have to be high on crack to pay $11.00 for two RCA chassis mount jacks. These sell for 20 pairs for $9.00 on eBay! Don't flush you hard earned money down the toilet!
3,Nice if you find it - Don&#65533;t waste effort searching for it,"Morgan is visiting friends in Greece when she goes down to the beach one night for a midnight swim. Before she knows it a stranger is holding her at knifepoint. She doesn't tell anyone about the incident and few days later Morgan is introduced to her friend's neighbor, Nicholas Gregoras. To Morgan's surprise he's the same man that held a knife to her on the beach! Only this Nick is different than the man Morgan had met, he's more smooth, without the rough edges. Morgan doesn't know what game he's playing. Then, when she finds a body, she doesn't know who to trust.This was a good book. It was not one of those books that you can't put down, but at the end I was happy with the conclusion of the story. If I had never read a Nora Roberts book before this, I wouldn't remember the author from this book. This is a nice book if you come across it. It's definitely not worth searching for."
3,Fun read but not real bright,"I was a little disappointed that a supposedly intelligent women wouldn't realize she could cause more harm than good by insisting to be involved in something she wasn't trained to do. Nora is my favorite author. The story was good, but fell short of great because I believe most of us women are smart enough not to go running into a gunfight (unarmed, that is)"
3,I've read better...,"While I did like this book(which was part of the ""Mysterious"" 3-book collaboration) I think it could have been a bit more exciting."
2,A mediocre adventure/RPG,"Being a big fan of the Might and Magic universe, I bought this game immediately. I must admit to being impressed initially, but the more I played the less I liked it.The pros: Combat and movement controls are superb, inventory system is simple, spell effects are neat, graphics are fairly nice, very stable.The bad: Running, running, running, running... restrictive environments (canyons, dungeons, etc), limited number of items/spells/monsters, terrible voice acting, some glitches in the graphics engine, short (20-30 hours of total gameplay), no replay value.Bottom line: Unless you're a die-hard adventure gamer, wait until this one hits the bargain bin."
3,Fun But Uncomplete,"If your experience with 3D games such as Unreal Tournament, Half-Life, Quake 3, etc. you'll find gameplay fairly easy to master. Use the mouse to look around and the keyboard to move. The look of the game is very similar to Tomb Raider (your character even does backflips and sideflips, which is retarded because no one could do backflips while wearing heavy plate male).The main problem about the game is the finale. At the begginning of the game you get a nice 3D video. Throughout the game the characters you encounter have audio speech. At the very end of the game you get an animated sequence with text (no audio). Plus the game really has no plot, it hardly ties in with the Might and Magic series except that it mentions the Mandate of Heaven. This can be explained because the game was created by 3DO (not thier sub company New World Computer) and the creator of the Might and Magic series (Jon Van Caneghem) did not help with the development of this title."
1,A great idea that died by management.,"This game had a good look to it but it was rushed to market and it shows.The quests are completed in order with no side quests. The method of transport is probably the marjority of the game; running! If you like watching marathons, then this game is for you.The fighting is predictable as you watch your opponents attack and easily see patterns.The spell list is ok but most of the spells you don't use. The method of buying and selling is confusing at first. The weapons are ok.The final fight was uninteresting. I found one quest(the ice titans) more of a challenge then the final villan.If you can get it cheap, then what the heck. Otherwise, save your money."
1,it sucks,"While the PS1 was a decent version, the pc is absolute crap. Bad graphics compared to the console, terrible voice acting (you can tell they are in a bad sound room), and overall a worthless piece of s***. Do not buy this game; in fact, avoid this game like the plague."
2,Strange Obsessions,"Good basic information, if you can get past the hippie packaging, but her chapter on weight loss is prejudiced and offensive and the one on douching is downright revolting. It's time for a new edition that reflects some modern consciousness."
5,the 8 Human Talents,I love the book and was pleased to get it shipped in such timely manner!A must read.......as far as I am concerned!D.H.
3,Struggling to Get Through This,"I have 3 yoga books. Two of them are nothing but exercises. It is my understanding that if ""Jesus"" did exist as it is supposed, he was promoting kundilini yoga. Its the star gate out of the planet. It is the temple within you.......its the way to bypass all your problems and find peace. I purchased this book because of the large quantity of positive reviews, but I found it disappointing. I still have not finished reading it. I was expecting more out of it. It does have some yoga exercises in it which I do like. They are much easier than the exercises in my other two yoga books. If your struggling to get started in a routine like I am, these exercises are perfect. They don't require much physical effort and are a good baby step to get you in to a routine."
5,The Eight Human Talents,"I found this to be a great book. Offering insightfulness into some of our most difficult and troubling personal inner conflicts. It has a very powerful healing quality that is easy to follow. Her and the other offerings of advice are given in the most humbling manner, Truly a book worth spending time with."
5,The Eight Human Talents by Gurmukh,"The Eight Human Talents explains each of the eight chakras. I bought this book after purchasing Gurmukh's Kundalini Yoga dvd. The dvd offered simple yet highly effective powerful exercises which I have followed for about a month or two now with good results. My physical and emotional health is greatly improved and I am thrilled to find Gurmukh's book. Gurmukh offers more exercises in the book along with personal anecdotes drawing on her life experience and her experience working with students. As Gurmukh says, kundalini yoga is doable for almost anyone in almost any physical condition and yet you will benefit from this practice in as little as three minutes a day. The Eight Human Talents is a valuable resource and worth owning to refer to again and again.Kundalini Yoga With GurmukhThe Eight Human Talents: Restore the Balance and Serenity within You with Kundalini Yoga"
5,"It'll get you jazzed about doing kundalini, whether you're a beginner or a teacher","This book is not a comprehensive beginner's manual for kundalini yoga, though it does introduce some simple but effective meditations. Instead, Gurmukh shares stories from her own journey into awareness, and those of her students who have changed their lives with kundalini yoga and meditation. Her personal insights and uplifting stories make this book a worthwhile read, whether you're just getting started with kundalini yoga, or if your individual practice could use a healthy and uplifting boost.I've been reading small snippets of this book in the early morning hours before going to group sadhana, and her little nuggets of wisdom help set my intention for my meditations and the rest of my day. I plan to give copies of this book to my families and friends to introduce them to the technology, and help them understand why I have committed to incorporating KY into my life."
5,The Eight Human Talents : Restore the Balance and Serenity within You with Kundalini Yoga,This is a wonderful book which explains the 8 chakras in detail and describes Kundalini yoga excercises and meditations. It was enjoyable reading and offered insight to many areas of this study.
3,High School Level,I bought this DVD for my sixth grade classroom. There was formula after formula and my students were just laughing. This is a high school level program. It was a little corny for high school and too deep for sixth grade.
5,This song just might be one of the dopest this year.,It's about time Sporty Theives get their props in this industry. However as good as they are they might want to find a new subject for their tracks (Cheapskate). Combining whack beats with funny ass rhymes this should get some recognition. Peace
4,Phat and Hot,"This song tells listeners the truth about many of the 90's females. It's funny because it's the truth. I am no pigeon, butI know a few. Sporty Thievez hit the nail on the head, this single is the BomB!!!!!!"
4,A music fan from New York,I think the song is good but I wanna to know whatTLC had to say about it but I love scrubs I'm not afending by the song pigeons but Sporty Thivez just prove to TLC that they are a bunch of scrubs because they were afending by the song it's not TLC fault that guys can't there mack on people enjoy
1,SPORTY THIVEZ ARE A BUNCH OF SCRUBS,I'M a male SPORTY THIVEZ CAN STAND HEARING THE TRUTH ABOUT THEMSELVES I think the album derserve a 0 TLC is still number 1 and sporty thivez is number 16 and no pigeons is getting corny
5,A phat tune,"It sure beats the hell outta TLC's ""No scrubs"" Although i love girls i still think its a phat tune. It's off the hook and Sporty thievez is definitely ill and blazin'"
5,They keepin it real,"I'm tired of hearing girls dog men all the time. It's about time that someone had our back. Pigeons, Chickens they all the same. Us guys ain't takin that no mo. Sporty Thieves is keepin it real for all the brothers in the NYC."
5,This song is tight!!!!!!!!!!!!,I think that this song is so tight because I think TLC thought they were going to get away with calling all men scrubs and this what they get!!!!
4,Beating this game is a snap,"I would have say this game was a little fun, BUT there are some cons. Frist the game is so easy, I've rented it and got though it in a day. The pros. the graphics are good and so is the gameplay. Please, rent it."
1,pong had better controlls,"This game is a very poor game, the controlls are horrilbe and confusing, the graphicks are very undefinate and all in all it is a horrible game, if you want a game like this that is a lot better get 007, the world is not enough. It's controlls are easy to fall into the plot is great and it is a very challenging game. the multiplayer is a million times better than the one in this game and at least you can unlock codes."
2,WAY TOO EASY,"When I first played this game I thought it was pretty good. Going around on the track taking pictures of pokemon is addicting, but the game ends way to fast (I beat it within a day) and offers no replay value or challenge. It's definitely worth a rental, but don't think about buying it until it goes WAY down in price."
4,Couldn't believe how much fun this game is!!!,This game is a little older...BUT is super fun!It made a great time out of gamer date night!Good for luaghs and sport!
4,What we wanted,"I had told my kids about this game and was excited for find it for such a great price. It was shipped quickly and is in great condition, as posted. Thanks so much :) My kids love the game."
4,"Great game, but.....",I really enjoyed Pokemon Snap. I think it's cool that the game never ends. One of the neat things to find different kinds of pictures. Example: if you work hard and get the boost engine; you can speed ahead and see pokemon that weren't there before. I did this in the beach level and got a really close pic of a Lapras! Why i give this game four stars is because it can get boring after awhile. How many times can you take a picture of pikachu? If you get this game don't play it too much right away or else you'll be done it and that'll be it!
4,Gotta snap'em all.Well only 63 but 150-63 same thing,"This game may be really easy to beat but give some credit to it.this game was one of the funnest games i ever played at first.Everybody says its bad because its really easy to beat. so what at least you can beat it some games you can't even get past the first level.but it does get boring after awile,but it was very fun at first.I also think that you should be able to snap all 150 pokemon not just 63 pokemon.it has 7 levels Beach,Tunnel,Volcano,River,Cave,Valley,andRainbow Cloud where you can try to snap Mew.Despite that they don't have my 2 favorite pokemon ''Cubone and Pinsir'' its still a great game."
5,Variety,"This game is great. It doesn't matter if you've ever seen a Pokemon or know what one is. It's fun and has incredible replay value. With over 60 Pokemon to catch, the game is fun and challenging. You might wonder what's so hard about taking pictures. Well, the game is not just about pictures, you must learn to use the tools you recieve to uncover new Pokemon and new levels. When you get to explore places lik a beach, volcano, river, and cave, the variety is wonderful. You'll regret only having seven levels to play."
5,This is a great game!,This game is great! You take the part of Todd the pokémon photographer who has been hired by professor oak to help him get photos for his report on pokémon island. The game is easy to complete and takes less than a day to finnish but your quest ought to be to get good pictures and try to beat all your old high scores for each pokémon picture. Some people have been complaining and giving this game low ratings but they don't put their heart into the game and try to get the best pictures they can. The coolest thing is you can make your own stickers from the pictures you took.
2,not as cool as other pokemon games,"This game may be appealing to the eye and ear. The name Pokemon will sell the game by itself. But after you get the game, you play it for a couple of hours and you're done. There is not much to do in it. The graphics are pretty darn cool but the fun factor is just way too low."
5,A great family game!,"We loved it! This is one game a family can enjoy together. Somewhat tedious for an adult, but still enjoyable to watch the kids take pictures of all their favorite Pokemon. Highly recommend this game!"
2,needs variety!,"THis game was okay, but the whole concept was kinda boring. You just go thru the same worlds and the same exact thing happens, every time. its pretty boring after u play it 4 a while."
2,DONT BUY THIS GAME,"Sure, its fun 4 five minutes, but after that Id rather be taking pics of my bathroom than the Pokemon in this game. I spent $3.95 on this game, but now I wish I would have bought gum or marbles instead!"
3,Pokemon...,"I played this game at a sleep over. I am 13 years old and am not much of a pokemon fan. I have played the gameboy and thought it was fun... but would probably get boring after awhile. When I saw this game on a commercial I though tit was a good idea of the wrong subject. Maybe if the pokemon would attack the player while he lobs blue gob things at him. Say, what a great idea... next time, Nintendo, have the pokemon attack.This game does have good graphics, yet the variety of areas to take pictures at is limited. I thought this game was pretty fun from what I played of it... but I am possitive that I would get bored of it.If the player could walk around by themselves and the pokemon would run away if they saw you (or attack you)maybe more people would like this game. My advice, rent it. If you are crazy about it, buy it. If you aren't, by a better game."
3,Gamer seeking fun from Orange,"Well to tell you thr truth this game was actually a little fun! The graphics were pretty good but it was very dissapointing the fact that it didn't contain all 150 pokemon characters. The levels were pretty creative and the Vulpix's in the Volcano level were totally adorable! The downfall for me was that the rainbow cloud level really was just boring! Mew is my favorite character, but you barely got close to it. So all in all this is a good game to rent but not something that I would personally like to own."
4,Fun for all Ages,One of the few nonviolent video games the kids actually like. Instead of being armed with a gun the character has a camera. The goal is to take the best picture of the moving Pokemon. Their grandma likes the game too.
3,Pokemon Snap,My 5-year-old son loves it!!! He enjoys feeding the pokemon and seeing the various types more than taking their pictures though.
3,Good for the little ones,"I guess I was expecting more from the game. It's a pretty good game for the little ones, but my 10 year old got bored with it after about 30 minutes. The game consists of taking virtual snapshots of ""wild"" pokemon. Once you get the gist of it (about 15 minutes or so), it's pretty easy to master. Good game for kids under 7 or so, and good for beginners into the Pokemon world."
2,Pokemon Snap,"The makers of Pokemon Snap obviously were just trying to earn some money off the Pokemon frenzy. It's way too easy, and only 63 Pokemons are available. The storyline is weak too, trying to take a picture of Mew. Out of my stand point, there are only a couple of things good about Pokemon Snap, the graphics(surroundings,enviroment) and how the Pokemon act. If you're not a Pokemaniac, don't waste your time on it. (Even if it is just a couple minutes)"
3,A challenging game for ages 6-12...,"My kids are huge Pokemon fans. This was the first Nintendo game I ever bought them, when I got the system. Of the several they have, they play this the least (at this time).The game is interesting, and challenging, but not as much fun as it could be. The Pokemon are sometimes hard to get in focus, and the frustration level can get high for younger children. On the other hand, older kids seem to breeze through it, and then are done with it. It does not lend itself to lots of repeated play.I wish that more than one player could save their data on the cartridge, that is a drawback. And it would have been nice to have more diverse kinds of Pokemon. However the graphics are great, the premise is good (I really like the lack of violence) and the different environments are fun to explore. Bottom line, buy this game if your kids are Pokemaniacs, but don't expect them to spend hundreds of hours playing it."
1,A total waste of time and money,"Someone, somewhere decided to play a cruel, cruel joke on the world, and out of that decision came the vile game Pokemon Snap. You sit in a cart, and do the tedious and tired task of photographing overly-cute Pokemon. I think Pokemon Bang would've have been a MUCH better idea."
4,Perfect for the younger set!,"We bought this game for our daugter for Christmas - it was the only thing she wanted! It is, suprisingly, a lot of fun. My husband says I'm addicted and he may be right! There is no violence or any objectional matter. Our six-year old can play it well but still be challenged. The Pokemon are very cute and animated. You do have to pay attention to be able to find them all, we have been playing it A LOT for the last week and still have 6 more to find. Overall - recommend for families with small children."
3,Too short for its own good,"Even being an anti-Pokemon person, when my mom got me Pokemon Snap for Christmas last year, I had already played the game and knew what to expect. The game has dazzling graphics, and no slowdown. The grading system is fair in the sense that it gives the right amount of points, but if you don't get enough points under one section, you don't get any for the rest of the picture, making it kind of annoying for hard to get creatures like Staryu. The thing is, it's not very long. Only 63 Pokemon are in this game and once you beat it, it gets exetremely boring. In fact, the whole Pokemon deal is overrated. I can't stand it anymore and I wish it would all just end. Good for a Saturday night rental, but nothing more."
2,A decent game,"The first pokemon title for the N64 was not the best thing to hit the market. The game was designed poorly. They could have made it better but they just threw it in stores as soon as they could. Mostly for little kids, older children wouldn't like it. A safe game with no guns or blood, just pokemon. By taking pictures of pokemon and earning new gifts like food and a flute to get new poses and reactions for better photos. The game is very easy to beat. Get it for little kids,5-8 years old. Older children would be bored and put it away once they beat it. Not the best game."
3,3 Stars,"I like this game, but it's got no challenge and absolutly NO story like the gameboy ones. There's no surprise ending, no pop up mini games and no rivals(thats the biggest problem). Yeah this is ok for 8 years olds, but the secret paths can get EXTREMELY frustrating to get, espesially the last one. If they added a rival and a mini game or two, this game would be much more fun!"
2,Why?,"Pokemon Snap is just another game with a pokemon title to get kids to buy it. With it's short gameplay and thin plot made me fell that when I finshed the game, one hour later, that I wasted I hour of my life. I can't say it isn't a good game because I don't like Pokemon and there are good graphics, but if your loking for a game for fun and not for pokemon stay away from this game."
1,How Short And Boring Can This Game Get!?,"This game was an extremely easy game that you can beat in 15 minutes. All you do is take pictures of dumb Pokemon. Then when you beat the game you have to try to beat the computers impossible scores. THAT'S IT, DO NOT BUY"
2,"Fun at first, then it's just boring as can be.","When I first got this game I really liked it. Then after a while it didn't hold my interest. I would suggest renting the game, but don't buy t."
3,An OK game,Not that i'm real into Pokemon or anything. But I bought this game along time a go when it first came out. And i just recently played it and it is pretty cool.
2,Easy and Boring,"I got this game two years ago, the first time I played it,I could tell it would be boring.I beat the game in one hour.I was expecting it to be much better.I don't recemend this games at all!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzz,If u like to go about 1 mile per hour take pictures of little pieeces of nothing and hate challenges then this game is for u. Also the game is short 64 guys when there is supposed to be 150 u know 64 150 same thing. If u see this game and u have already played it it would bring back memories BAD memories if u want tose bad memories get the game other wise i dare u to get the game u will probably like it (yea right)!
1,BOOORRRRRRIIIIIIIINNNNNNGGGGGGGGG!,All you do is you move a guy around a track and take pictures of Pokemon. The best pictures get the most points.
4,"This toy is fun . It is not educational, but it is durable.",I thought this game was fun because There is alot of stradigy in it. I also like going through difirent areas and seeing the pokemon.
5,This is one of the most innovative games of all time,"I have been a video gamer for along time, and I have never seena more innovative approach to a game. END"
4,Pokesnap,"It's a good game, really fun, and it kept me playing for a while. However, it's no fun once you beat it and it can only save one game."
3,pokeman snap,"Pokemon snap is a game intended mostly for younger kids. The object of the game is to take pictures of the pokemon you see. You acumulate points depending on how good your'e picture is.There are about 10 levels in the game each with different challenges. sometimes you have to go back a level to get new pokemon that you can only see with flutes or when you throw an apple.If you have not played this game you might think it sounds easy but it actually is not. Sometimes you need to lure a pokemon to get a picute of it. with others you have to use a poke flute, you have to be quick or else you will miss the desired pokemon and yo'l have to try again. little things like that add to the replay value of the game.Over all this is a unique game with beutiful graphics. no multiplayer means it won't be every body's favorite. but if you are a diehard pokemon fan pick this one up."
5,Pokemon Snap,"I think Pokemon Snap is very fun.It's very easy too.When I first got the game it only took me two and a half days to start and finish it!The only problem with it is that it's too short and you can't take pictures of all 151 Pokemon.Well,I hope you enjoy reading this editorial."
3,Not to challenging,"For the games cheap price the game is worth buying. The game was not too bad when it lasted but I beat the game really fast. But still, I recommend this game because its so cheap."
2,Simple Minded and Boring,"I cant believe this game got better reviews then ""HEY YOU PIKACHU"".You ride around on a trolly through the same old boards (i think 6-7 total) taking pictures of the characters. Professor Oak either excepts them or doesnt depending on the ""quality"" of the picture (size, pose, and technique). Eventually, you get a couple of items that help you take better pictures. Big Deal!The only reason i gave this two stars instead of one is because my son can play it, take as many pictures as he wants, and i dont have to ""pay"" to ""develop"" them.This is the most simple minded boring game i have ever bought for the N64.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (Woops i'm falling asleep writing this review)."
4,Not that bad really,"Believe it or not. It's incredibly fun. Yes, it may be pokemon, but even people who don't like pokemon should play through this once. The only reason I'm selling mine is because I've played it over and over and over. There's enough to keep you entertained for days and some problem solving is involved as well. The only draw back is that sometimes I had to look up how to make certain creatures evolve and that you have to play the same levels over a few times. Really though, this game is pretty fun and is worth it for a few bucks for a christmas present for someone! Especially pokemon enthusiasts!"
3,"Lots of fun, but much too short","Considering this game is used and cheap now for a retired system, I'd recommend a purchase just to see a type of gameplay that Nintendo never tried again. You are a photographer, and have been hired by Professor Oak to document Pokemon living in the wild. You ride through levels on a fixed track, snapping photos. You have a few items at your disposal to help spur the Pokemon into different actions, which racks up better photos and more points. The graphics are somewhat average, but the Pokemon animate well. Controls are easy to master.So yeah it's very different and very fun, but in the end much too short. You have six levels and a bonus seventh level (that really isn't much of a level), but you see less than half of the original 151 Pokemon. Getting better photos gives the game some replay value, but you can basically see everything in a weekend. But like I mentioned above, it's cheap now, and the novelty makes it worth a buy for fans and non-fans alike."
3,"Yeah,we were hooked...","for a short time, then it got pretty boring for us adults. kids love it. It's good because it's nonviolent, and can be challenging."
4,not bad,"i bought this game a while ago and was addicted at the beginning. there are numerous challenges, some of the pokemon are very hard to get good shots for. graphics are great, worlds are interesting, and pokemon look very realistic. lots of little extras to gain along the way (pokemon food, poke flute).the only thing wrong with this game is it's easy. i got through all the courses, challenge scores, and filled up my report in a few days. if you love pokemon, this would be awesome. but, if you're looking for a real challenge, look somewhere else."
3,Pokemon and Beyond,"Pokemon for gameboy is alright, but Pokemon Snap is awesome! The graphics are great, but it is kind of easy and it can get boring. Also there is only about 60 pokemon you can take pictures of. I recomond taking pictures in the valley, river, cave, and the tunnel because there are cool Pokemon there. The levels are gerat too. The Pokemon signs are clever. This game (for anyone) is easy to . Good Luck!"
4,This is a very cool game.,"This game is great. I don't mean to sound like a parent, but Pokemon Snap is a good, fun game that doesn't promote violence, like Turok and stuff like that. Instead of blowing up tanks or whatever, you take pictures of different Pokemon. It is a lot of fun to start a new PKMN (probably short for POKEMON) Report and have every picture you take be ""NEW!"", but it gets old after a while. Beat this game once, leave it for a week or so, come back to it and voila! Fun Factor restored. Overall, an exellent game."
3,Best for little kids,"Pokemon Snap is a game about taking pictures for Prof. Oak so he can create the perfect Pokemon report. There are seven levels,three items (besides your camera, of course)and your trusty futuristic-style vehicle for getting around various areas of the levels. It may seem cool at first, but it is actually a very easy game. Each level has a specific goal to meet, whether it is gaining a high score or doing something specific (for instance, hitting an Electrode with an apple in the Tunnel level."
4,I like it.,"It is a really good game and I'd recommend for many people, but after you've gotten all the pokemon, there's nothing to do anymore!"
4,"""Pokemon with style""","You got the game. You got the camera, you got the film. Now, to complete this game you have to snap at least 63 pokemon for your report. Professor Oak must see it first before putting it in your report. If you do not like Oak's results, you can keep your pictures in your photo album! Away from Professor Oak.1.Life Span: Average of 3 to 6 months before getting bored2.Durability: Can last a lifetime3.Endurance: Basically only one player mode available.Overall- This is a 4 star game cuz no multi player and only 63 pokemon. I really like my Mew picture!"
4,Pokemon Snap,"My daughter got it for christmas. She still loves it, even though all the levels have been opened. She is a pokemon fan and loves to take pictures of them still. As for adults, it's pretty much a sleeper after you've opened up all the levels."
2,Poke'mon Snap,"If you are over 10, I don't think you would like this game very much; It gets so boring afer you've played it about 3 times. If you are over 10 and want a good Poke'mon game, get Poke'mon Stadium 2!"
2,Not so much fun,"This was one of the very 1st games we purchased for our daughter, who was 6 at the time. I am an avid video game player, yet I don't like this one at all. I think the game is very monotonous, with very little clues or instruction. The graphics are good but the motion of swinging around to take pix can make one extremely nauseous. My daughter is completely lost playing the game but seems to enjoy it just the same. However, it is the least played game in our house -- maybe 1 or 2 x per year. Kirby and Super Mario are much better choices. Pokemon Stadium is even more fun. I'd skip this one or rent it at (...) -- it's not worth the money. Why are these games so expensive?"
4,Small but beautiful,"I've been a fan of Tanning for 30 years. This book was physically smaller than I expected, however the color prints are beautiful. It focuses on a period when her painting moved away from surrealism and found its own voice. It's abstract, however with far more acumen and ability than most abstract artists could muster - this period really stands on its own. This book is also a limited run of 2,000 copies, so if you see it cheap, you may want to grab it. Twelve paintings in full color, a bunch of family photos and a brief biography."
1,used to be the best 70% chocolate,"Now that the new ""improved"" bar is made in NH, USA they seem to think that it has to have soy lecithan and be made for the so called ""American taste"" as in sweeter and smoother. They really ruined a good thing. When the new version appeared at the local store I bought some and did not tell my family that it was a different ingredient list. The comments went like this: ""This isn't the same"" ""This tastes like a cheap chocolate bar"" ""Do you have any Lindt 70% chocolate?"" and so it went. When my current stash of the old style is gone I will be looking for a new favorite bar. I still find the old style once in a while, but I am afraid that it will be gone for good unless it can be ordered from a European supplier."
1,"new ""smooth"" recipe","This bar used to have the best chocolate flavor for the money, now it tastes like swiss miss solidified into a bar of wax. The closest I could find to what it used to taste like was some 63 percent Valrhona at double the price."
2,Chocolate flavored wax,"The new Lindt 70% tastes a lot like all the other waxy chocolate bars out there so if you like chewing on crayons you may like it, but if you really like chocolate you won't. It's really a shame they ruined a formerly excellent product."
1,Lindt just lost a 20+ year customer; BRING BACK LINDT CLASSIC!,"The flavor is now bland and boring (think Hershey Kiss), and the ""new and improved"" smooth texture reminds me of plasticizers.I spent probably hundreds of dollars on Lindt 70% chocolate bars over the years, but as soon as I tasted the new version, I will never by another Lindt product of any kind until they bring back the old one. Looking at all the other reviews, Lindt has made an identical mistake to Coke of releasing a new version and discontinuing the old one.I wouldn't be surprised if its cheaper to make (soy emulsifier wasn't on the original ingredient list and it tastes like they are using inferior coca), but this bar is an insult to the intelligence of every person who's tried the original."
5,I like it!,"I am not sure why so many folks are so bitter about this chocolate. I might not be a chocolate expert, but I definitely love good Swiss chocolate and I think this product is great (even though it is made in the USA - by a Swiss company). This stuff tastes great, is not too bitter for a 70% bar and gives me my chocolate fix without sending me into a sugar shock. The reason it melts in warm weather is because it is real chocolate - that's what it does. Anyhow, wanted to put in a good word for my favorite snack."
1,They have ruined a great product,I thought everyone was overeacting. I WAS WRONG!!!!!!!! This is the worst chocolate. Tastes like lard. Please do not waste your money. You cannot send it back.
2,Okay,"I'm not sure I'm reviewing exactly the same Lindt 70% bar as shown here, but it's the best match I could find. Here goes:What's good: Silken texture, the Lindt trademark, and strong chocolate flavor.What might be good for some: Intermediate ""dark"" chocolate flavor, richer than traditional ""dark"" chocolate, but without the bite of 85% or 90%. Personally, I like the sharp edge that this only hints at.What's not: Vanilla. I meean, I like vanilla, and the warm vanilla musk fills my nose more than with anything else I can remember - including most vanilla ice cream. When I want serious chocolate, though, I find it a floral distraction.Nice, I'll never turn it down, but it's not at the top of my list.-- wiredweird"
5,Smooth taste,"It is very smooth and tastes great! The percentage of 70% of coca is the right range, not very sweet."
1,So disappointing!,The 70% tastes like cheap Easter bunny chocolate. Green and Black I guess it will have to be. Sad though since the Lindt was very good in France.
1,Bland,"There was a square of this chocolate in a bag of Lindt dark chocolate truffles, a sample I guess. So glad I didn't buy a whole bar of this stuff because it was not very good. Left me wondering ""where's the chocolate""? Not much flavor at all. :P"
1,Does not travel well,Melts and spoils in shipping. Very disappointing in texture and flavor. You're better off buying this locally at full retail.
1,"I agree, it sucks","I totally agree with all of the other 1 star reviewers here. This used to be my favorite bar, but now it has almost no flavor and indeed does have a waxy texture."
3,Does anyone know if this is old or new recipe?,I dont want to order this if it the new recipe. Can someone verify the one that is offerered is the original.thanks
2,Very Bitter,"This applies only to the ""Natural Real Chocolate"" flavor. It's bitter. I did not like it at all. If you are a fan of dark chocolate, you might like it, because it has that same off-bitter taste for those of you with off-bitter taste."
5,Love this Product,"I have been using this for the last two years, i use it to make my smoothie in the morning. It tastes perfect with some frozen berries and banana.Its definitely something i can't be without."
5,FANTASTIC,"Having a physically demanding job, this gives me just the added edge I need to keep myself on top. Favorite Flavor - Natural Ral Chocolate - you can't beat Amazon's price, also!"
3,"strawberry, not so good","This review is for the strawberry muscle milk. I always think it's going to taste better than it does. I love the chocolate and the vanilla cream. If you want a really awesome strawberry muscle milk, use the vanilla cream and drop in about 4 or 5 frozen strawberries and blend it up. Super Yummy!"
3,"Good flavor, but doesn't mix well","The Chocolate tastes decent, only a mild hint of aspartame, but it doesn't fully mix (clumpy) when using a manual shaker."
2,The Rest of the Story,"I relied on the ingredients listed in Amazon's ad, they don't coincide with reality.Quote: Promotes efficient fat burning.How can it do that when it has 6 grams of fat per single scoop serving and 3 of those grams are SATURATED, the artery clogging kind?No mention of the Soluble Corn Fiber that the product now contains. This is listed in ingredients right after Alkalized Cocoa Powder. CORN FIBER!You might want to know, SALT is listed before the good sweeteners Stevia, but after the bad sweetener Fructose.Now for the BAD NEWS: NO CREATINE (that's right, does NOT contain Creatine and is NOT listed onmy label, but mentioned in Sales Ad."
5,Breakfast Wake Up,"I use this for breakfast. I can't wake up in the morning, so I need something strong. It helps me get out of bed and to school/work on time. I wish I had the energy and time in the morning to prepare a nice hot meal, but I just don't. I'm too lazy for all that. Instead, I prepare a muscle milk shake. The taste is typical chocolate. It goes down smooth. The pricing is about $20, which is okay. Overall, it helps to get ready for the early mornings."
1,Weird taste,"I love the banana creme and strawberry muscle milk drinks, as well as the chocolate powder mix from muscle milk. However, the ""naturals"" drink just has a weird, unnatural taste. First time I thought the fruit I was putting in the drink had gone bad, but turns out thats just how the powder tastes. I think its the stevia, and its possible I just have defunct taste buds that dont like stevia, because I know several people that like the stuff. Either way, I would suggest you try something with stevia in it before buying this product. You may love it, and in that case, this is for you."
5,Great Set!,"Supernatural has been one of my favorite shows since it premiered- the writing is good, consistent and always engaging. The acting is really great- this season saw great character development brought to life by two very talented actors. Both Jared and Jensen delivered week in and week out.What I loved about this set besides the outstanding video quality - though I would really like to see Supernatural also offered in HD HINT HINT! - I really loved the bonus features. The gag reel was fun- the episode commentaries were really insightful and the webisode thing at the end with the tons and tons of bonus stuff on practically every epi was something I had not seen done so completely before.Kudos to the team that produced these dvds- this is the kind of bonuses that we buy DVDs for!"
5,Love it!,It was brand new in pkg...the item was in excellent condition! Another extremely happy Amazon.com shopper! :)
5,Good and Bloody Fun!!,"This show is one of my favorites on TV. Lots of humor, just the right amount of ""cheesiness"" and very intense susupense that leaves you dying for more!"
3,Great show just won't always play,"This is a great show, unfortunately disk one wouldn't play on either of the computers I have in my house (both Macs). After reaching the max number of returns I decided to keep it because it would play on my DVD player, which I unfortunately won't have when I go to college in the fall. However, Amazon customer support was great through this and made a poor experience with a product a lot better. Besides the problem this season is great and the show just keeps getting better!"
5,The BEST EVER!!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this season of Supernatural, because it was adventureous, and very comical. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoy's exciting action, and HOT guys!!!!!"
3,DVDs themseleves are great,"The factory packaging is bad. Disc 5 won't stay where it's supposed to because the middle part is malformed, which means I have a loose disc all the time. Won't be long before it's scratched most likely.The set itself is fine and I love having the eps. A good number of them come with commentary as well."
1,disc 1 doesn't play on some blu-ray players,"I gave this only one star not because of the show (which is fantastic) but because of the problems that many people have had with disc one. I ordered two sets from amazon and I bought one set from Best Buy with the same result. I was finally able to figure out that disc one will only play on non-blu-ray machines (at least it won't play on my particular blu-ray player, which is a sony BDP-BX1). Fortunately, I kept my old sony player and was able to watch disc 1."
2,where the hells the gag reel etc?,i love the show...don't get me wrong. but i can't find half of the special features on disc six as they said there were? im i missing something?
4,Great other than minor issue.,"The only reason I rate these 4 stars because I bought these DVDs and received a set coded for Region 2 (Europe) I was not able to play on any device but my computer and was only able to do that by changing the settings in my video watching software to read Region 2 instead of Region 1 (USA) other than that the DVDs were great. This is disappointing but works just fine as I planned on watching them using my computer anyway. If anyone receives this product and cannot get them to play on normal DVD players or other devices, check the back of the box and look for a small globe with a number in it. If the number is anything but 1, then you have a different region code and must do what I did or return them. Otherwise, great show and great product."
4,Excelente...,"Excelente bluray... Lo unico malo es la traducción al españo, es un ASCO, traducción mal hecha, porfavor PENSAR antes de traducir hacer tan mala traducción...Excellent bluray... The only bad thing is the Spanish translation, is a mess, poorly made translation, please think before you translate do as bad translation..."
4,Awesome,"Was late getting here. But great condition. Awesome TV Show. Loved watching the entire season. Ordered season 2 & 3 at the same time but 3 came first and 2 was late getting here, so that bugged me. Other wise my favorite show. Supernatural is highly recommended."
5,Second Season Even Better Than the First!,"I'm counting down the days until the 2nd season of Supernatural comes out on dvd. Being a big fan of the show form day one, I didn't think it could possibly get better than the 1st season, but it just continues to grow and develop. I think my favorite part of this show is the relationship between Sam and Dean, and this season really explored that. The two are so similar in some ways, yet also very different (if that makes any sense). I have so many favorite episodes from this year that it's hard to single out any, but if I was going to pick one I'd say the two part finale. Both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki are incredible actors, and they perfectly capture the loyalty and love the two brothers share. Given the way the season ended, I can't wait for the new season to start!"
4,One of the few shows I record religiously...,"Two brother's chasing Demons???The Demon theme is OK and the secondary characters are good. but the brother's banter and each brother's quirks make the show. I don't know, maybe you have to have a brother (or in my case, brother's) that are really different than you to appreciate the show. Sometimes it really hits the nail on the head on relationships. Enjoy!!!"
4,Thriller Natural,"The second season of supernatural really fleshes out the bond between Sam and Dean Winchester. While the first season has more mysteries in the beginning, the second season introduces more allies and I think more of the episodes in season two stand alone. Overall each season of supernatureal seems to get better. This season is proof of that."
2,Disk Error,"Please be aware that disk one is faulty. This disk holds the first 4 episodes of SuperNatural and will NOT play on either a DVD player, or my computer."
5,Gotta love it..,"We have small kids, so it's impossible for us to catch all shows when they initially air on the CW channel. We also often fail to record them for later viewing - so having the complete first and second season on DVD is our way to catch up on episodes we have missed whenever we want (or can for that matter) without commercial and kid interruption. If you are into spooky scenarios and catchy/snappy scripts, this set (and the first season) are a 'must see and own'.. Enjoy :)"
5,Totally SWEET!,"Exciting, captivating, and a little bit scary...that's Supernatural. The chemistry between the brothers is amazing and drives this thrilling show. Great writing, great acting, compelling storyline. I don't buy TV shows because they get old fast, but I will watch this over and over again. BUY IT!"
3,Scared,Characters are believable and great acting. Very frightening at times with too much blood - especially from those already dead
5,Loved it!,Purchased as a gift along with seasons one and three and my daughter was thrilled to get them all! She loves the series and can now watch when she wants to.
5,Supernatural,"It took me the first series to get hooked, but now after watching all of the 2nd season, I'm hooked. These two are great together. I love the story line versus the out-of-order feel of the first season. This one has a story line that moves along at a good pace. Keep up the great work!"
5,Such a sad season!,"The things these boys do to save each other is amazing! Everything just keeps building, and you start to see why the Dad is so worried about Sam's destiny!"
5,Great,"Amazing price! For all of my Supernatural seasons on dvd I come to Amazon! Where else can you find the enjoyment of seeing Dean and Sam over and over for such a low price! Anyone that is a Supernatural junkie, as we are in the household, need go no further than here for your Supernatural fix at a great price!"
3,Happy but..,"I was very happy when my product came in, the timing for my order was amazing as usual. But, when i opened the new complete season of Supernatural, i found it to be ripped inside, like it had been eaten and there were bends in the flaps and some disks were covered in something sticky. This was the first time this ever happened to me since i've used Amazon, so i am very disappointed.... I collect perfect condition DVD boxsets and now i will have to return it to get one of better quality.I don't like to complain or bag on Amazon because i love it and i recommend Amazon to everyone... but i want to let them know that the New product they sold me didn't seem very new at all. D: Sorry )':"
5,:-D,"This season was well thought out just like all the others.Dean and Sam what I love about them is they decided to stay together and fight evil to find their father.I would recommend this series for anyone who loves the paranormal.BTW their shipping for any of these DVDs are excellent, none of mine have came broken or damaged."
5,ITS THE NEW X-FILES PEOPLE!,"Kim Manners(x-files) and alot of the x-files crew jumped on this show. Directors, show runners, directors of photography. All from X-FILES. And they went back to the same sites in Canada! This is the new X-FILES. And call me crazy- I think it's better. SUPERNATURAL ROCKS!P.S. Where's the classic rock soundtrack disc?Bravo Kim Manners. CW be brave-keep it on!"
1,Supernatural DVD,"I was very disappointed when I received my Supernatural:Season 2 DVDs. The CD's won't read in any of my DVD players, Playstation or computer because it has an error. I was really excited when my order arrived and now I'm extremely disappointed with Amazon."
1,4 stars for show; 5 stars for amazon; 1 star for set,"As I have read a couple of other reviewers write, disc 1 simply is unreadable on my sony bdp-350. All other discs work perfectly. Returned the set and received a second set and.....same thing! Luckily Amazon customer service rocks. I am buying elsewhere to see if problem persists."
2,unexpectedly boring,I was truly surprised how such an interesting theme could possibly become so boring.The only supernatural thing in all the series was the ability of the actors to survive their own selfabsorbance. Pretty faces with soap opera crying (sorry - wet eyes) + that neverending suffering - that manly sorrow deep in characters processing.such a blabla..
3,not bad for the price but one major problem,"ok well picture is quite good, price is good and low light sensitivity is better than on a pcline 300a, it also zooms in a little bringing your face closer to the cam. so in general use itis pretty good value.BUT there is one problem with this camera certainly under winME you may find your computer bluescreens on boot up with the camera plugged in. unplug the camera and your computer boots normally.on my system this happens everytime.The Pcline camera does not do this but has a poor picture quality.I won't speculate on the causes, I know of another camera which causes some computers not to boot, so who's fault is it the Cam manufacturer or the mainboard manufacturer. I doubt either will take the blame. If you can live with a relatively good quality camera that has to be unplugged when you reboot then this cam is ok, if not be prepared to have to return it."
1,Didn't work for me,Short and simple. This product was one of those purchases I wish I hadn't made. For starters the software wouldn't load. After much angst and downloading software from the mfr's site I got it loaded. I bought it specifically for video conferencing with Messenger. It wouldn't do that either. (no video on the opposite end) All tech support could do on the first contact was direct me to a microsoft site. No information there but more help available for $35. Now I'm contacting the mfr again for ANY instructions on use with Messenger. Most computer hardware is straight forward and not too tough to figure out. In the event that a high hurdle comes along it's nice to have tech support and a total let down when it doesn't really exist.
1,Webcam NX is a piece of &amp;*!#&amp;*%,"Software EXTREMELY difficult to install. Hardware crashes computer. If you use WIN98SE, look elsewhere because this so-called webcam is not for you.Yeeccchh!"
1,Works great... when it works!,"Don't bother! (...)Other than [the] critical failing, the camera works fine. Good video, no need to focus, set light levels, colors, anything. The interface is easy to use and intuitive. Easy to configure. If all you want is a webcam that gets your pearly whites on the internet, this will do it for you.When it will do it for you.One other thing... it SAYS that it will E-mail pictures as it snaps them, but this is only if you have some funky Microsoft mailer program. Gotcha!Bottom line: Try something else."
3,USB Compatibility,"This is actually NOT a review & rating was given just on average. I'm just wondering if this device is compatible with a high speed USB 2. Because it says it requires USB 1.1. So, can anybody suggest me on this matter? I appreciate any suggestion. Thanks."
2,Predator ripoff,"This movie doesn't start out too bad, a mad scientist creates some creature out of DNA yadda yadda yadda he starts killing everyone. But the second half - good grief! We're talking Predator ripoff right down to a scene-by-scene basis. There's also this ""heartfelt"" funeral for a character that we couldn't possibly care less about that's about enough to make you barf. Then more scenes stolen directly from Predator.Poor Jurgen Prochnow. He's a really good actor. If I were him, I'd kill my agent with a very slow acting poison, just like he did to Jurgen's career."
2,An Alien/Predator rip-off,"But it's good cheesy fun.It's a low-budget ""epic"" filmed in the Philippines.Too bad MST3K didn't tackle this one.The hero is a likeable,misunderstood guy;of course,he has to engage in an ancient shamanic ritual consisting of body paint (???) to fight the evil creature.The heroine is the Usual Damsel in Distress.She gets to run around&be; rescued a lot.Then there's the Ubiquitous Annoying Boy.He whines so much you end up wishing the alien had him as an appetizer.Jurgen Prochnow gets to overact as the Eeeevil Mad Scientist.He's mastered the cliche.Yay!As for the alien,it looks like it came out of 'Alien.' HR Giger didn't waste his money suing the director.If you want to have a Bad Movie Night,this is perfect!"
2,In German,Thought it would be in english. Subtitles work but better if I could understand.Good flick but not what I expected.
1,Little Lord Fauntleroy,I am also looking for a copy of Little Lord Fauntleroy with Ricky Shroder and Alec Guinness. I have seen all the other films of this title and none comes close to the wonderful feeling you get when you watch this version. I also wish it would come out on DVD. I would buy it in a minute. I lost my VHS version due to a flood and of all things I lost I miss this one the most.
1,Terrible,"A dreadful version of the Burnett classic. The boy playing Cedric is far too old for the part - the only thing that saved Ceddie in the book from being cute enough to puke over was the fact that he was only seven years old. This kid comes off as insipid and painfully effeminate. Other boys his age would beat the snot out of him the moment they saw him, and rightfully so. I felt like giving him a few whacks myself.In addition, it takes away the punch of the Earl's redemption - this version has him sending Cedric out of the house when it looks as though his claim is false (albeit regretfully), while in the book and the other two movie versions he has come to value his grandson for who he is, not for the title he holds - a great leap considering how little he had valued Ceddie's father.Skip this version. Stick with the Freddie Bartholomew or Ricky Schroder interpretations, both of which are far superior."
1,Little Lord Fauntleroy,"I was terribly disappointed when I started watching this movie and realized it wasn't the one with Rick Schroder that was made in the 80's. I felt misguided since you listed his name in the credits.This version isn't ""that"" bad, although I found it too slow, only if you hadn't seen that other one before; otherwise, spare yourselves and don't even try it!"
3,"A movie, not the mini-series","When a book is made into a mini-series, I'd like to buy the actual mini-series. If you're like me, and don't look carefully when you buy...you realize too late that this is an edited version of the original hit BBC mini-series, cut down to movie length. How would you feel if when another classic BBC adaptation of the same year, 1995, ""Pride and Prejudice"" was offered for sale, it was edited down to half its original length? It would be unacceptable, right?Well. That's what's happened here. The ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" mini-series was 300 min. This DVD is 170. Do the math."
4,Excellente,"First came across Tito and Tarantula on Robert Rodriguez's Desperado soundtrack - it kicked [...] and this album is more of the same bluesy rock. Stinging guitar licks and passionate highway rock - very visual, very dramatic, very poetic. Highly recommended..."
5,Hang on to your bottom,Everyone knows when music is good. This CD will make you get up & move. Simply BAD to the BONE
2,"One great song, the rest is junk","The very first song has an almost hypnotic musical element about it which captured my interest. After that, there is nothing on the album I like. Listen to a few seconds of that song and see if you don't agree. (You should be able to do that for free through the net.) It's probably better to just buy the one song rather than the whole album."
3,Menacing,"The 3 stars are a comparison to T&T's other albums (all of which I have except the 2009 release). This album almost sounds like a soundtrack conglomeration and it is co-produced with Robert Rodriquez. That said, it does contain some of the most bluesy/rock jamming that Tito has ever laid out. The production, like the CD ""Little Bitch"", is better than some of his later efforts which adds to the overall likability meter. However, some of the lessers songs sound similar and even the best tunes lack the intrinsic quality of later stuff that makes T&T a great band. Highlights include ""After Dark"", ""Strange Face"", ""Back to The House"" and the slower (but always visceral) efforts of ""Sweet Cycle"" and ""Flying In My Sleep"" (which sounds like a bittersweet lucid dream commentary). A strong first effort for this band (not Tito, of course---see PlugZ, Cruzados and Psychotic Aztecs) with hints of the promise to come. In retrospect, I bump it up to 3.5 STARS."
1,DOES NOT COME WITH CD-R,"Amazon said my item was delivered Thursday, October 6 and did not show up until Thursday, October 13- one week late. That wasn't such a big deal. But for labeling the item ""Keychamp 2.0 with CD-R"" then NOT giving me the CD is the cause for my low rating."
2,24 BUCKS...????,"I can't bring myself to say where you can get these for less that $5 each since I'd rather not promote them, but let's just say it's not Target.It'd need to be made out of solid stainless steel and a whole lot sturdier for me to even consider paying $24...some one got taken to the cleaners.Brett"
2,arrived rusted,"Piece arrived rusted. No time to exchange by Xmas (item is a gift), so I had to search our local stores to find one."
4,"Good Item, price a little high","Product is sturdy and does it's job. No complaints on the function or useability of this. I do however don't think it is worth more than $5. These are readily available at any home improvement store, grocery stores, and big box stores like Target. As a side note, who knew that a regular can open will open the top of a beer can so easily and smoothly? If you have steady hands you can balance your bird on the can alone without needing a rack. However a rack does make it easier and less risk of spilling hot moltant beer and chicken juice on yourself. If using in the oven (or you want a clean grill) then put a pan under the rack while cooking."
1,Greatly Disappointing,"Though well written, Hearn's book adds nothing new to our understanding of the New Orleans Campaign. His bibliography indicates that he did little research in primary sources, of which hundreds are available. He appears to have ""borrowed"" citations from the best book on the subject--Charles L. Dufour's _The Night the War Was Lost_. If you are interested in this campaign, read Dufour and don't bother with Hearn."
2,Too much backround noise.,"I bought this for my husband to watch TV, he sometimes has trouble hearing. This amplifies the sound OK, but it also amplifes backround noise so it was not helpful."
4,Great starter hearing device,"This ""Personal Sound Amplier"" is a perfect starter hearing aide - for the person who is not yet ready to commit to a full hearing aide either in terms of cost or acceptance. It also works well for multiple users such as at the nursing home where I work. It can be use for interviews with seniors or to help them participate in group activites such as exercise groups, social meals, or crafts. Even with those who have severe hearing loss but refuse to wear hearing aides, it can be helpful to avoid misunderstandings and frustration. At this price, we don't even worry about losing the odd one if means independance for someone for a period of time. The easy and cheap battery replacement (AA batteries) also mean we don't worry about having forgetful seniors leave them on and let the batteries go dead. A real sense of freedom and independence with this device!"
2,"Limited possibilities, but inexpensive","The PSA 8000 Personal Sound Amplifier is probably useful on a limited basis.It doesn't help me when watching TV any more than just turning the volume up does. However, it is inexpensive (about $20) and I do feel it can be useful when listening to a speaker in a large auditorium, where volume conrols aren't available."
3,Not bad,"Angel Sales PSA 8000 Personal Sound AmplifierI bought this product for my mother who is 87 years old and has been needing the TV, etc. turned up really loud to hear it. My husband and I were getting headaches, so I thought I would try this. It does work, although you have to expect it will pick up all sounds, background noise, talking, etc. also. It does not differeniate between tv and other noises. But she is enjoying it and so are we. One thing, don't put the ear pieces and the box too close together when on or it will squeal. I am glad I purchased it."
2,horrible technology,"This product is so poorly made that it's shocking. The sound quality is horrible!!! If you make even the slightest noise, such as turn a page in a book, this product will amplify that noise. With all the background noises that are amplified, you won't even be able to clearly hear the sounds that you want to hear, such as your radio or tv. This product is very annoying to use."
2,Doesn't work for me.,"Everything is amplified the same. So, the nosie increases at the same time. Drop a pencil on the table and it sounds like a cannon."
3,Mic too sensitive to plastic enclosure,"This unit could have been a great personal amplifier if the mic would have been ""isolated"" from its enclosure. Any movement against the enclosure creates way to much ""static"" sound.Maybe a rubber case or a thin foam rubber wrap would isolate the scratching sound. Other than that it works fine, especially for the low price it costs."
3,hearing enhancement,Sometimes works too good when there is a lot of background noise.overall a decent product for the money.
4,Angel Sales PSA 8000 Personal Sound Amplifier,"My father refuses to buy hearing aids. However, he will wear this when I ask him to -- which saves my voice from yelling to be heard!"
3,product seems to be good,I tested indoor for a TV program and it looks OK. Haven't tried yet outside.
4,An enjoyable story,"A bit of a change of pace from your usual English historical romance, with adultery not set up from childhood, and the betrayal not as sharp. The plot was well paced, and the characters were well written. I must say however that Malloren was a bit.. well a LOT too trusting in this situation. I found his brother's reaction much more believable and in fact much more of an interesting character. All in all, however, I enjoyed the book."
3,Just Good...,"There's really nothing wrong with this book and nothing that I didn't like. The writing was okay and the characters were average in development. There's was just nothing that jumped out at me to make me say ""Wow, I love this book."" This is just a good reading book."
1,Pain-zer Commander,"This is my absolute favorite kind of WW2 game, but I could not get it to work with my WindowsXP at all, even though the demo download worked pretty well. It locks up immediately so badly that I have to turn off the pc to clean it up. I tried different settings, like Windows 95, etc. and even downloading the latest patch didn't help. I would give it 0 stars, but the review won't allow it, so it gets a faux one."
1,I got ripped off. Don't buy from this person,"The game had a missing file that would not allow me to install it onto the hard-drive. I tried every ave. to find a way to install it, but to no avail. The seller knew what he/she was selling. If I were you, I wouldn't trust this seller."
1,Didn't work out for me,"I did not have very much luck with this product. The dough would stick in the cutter and I was not able to get it out without completely destroying the shape of the dog bone. I thought I needed more flour, but even so, the dough kept getting stuck in there. I would save your money and get the dog bone cookie cutters that are just the outline of the bone. The idea of this product is adorable, but it just didn't work out for me."
4,Bow wow wow,I bought this to make bone shaped sugar cookies for my dog obsessed niece. She loved them. the bonus is she got to make biscuits for her dog to. Nice item!!
1,Invalid Battery - then POOF!,"This battery was great for about 2 months, then the phone gave me an 'invalid battery' message & stopped charging. Now, my phone is dead! I will now start the process for my money back."
3,beware: might not get the listed Lenmar model,"I ordered from ""Accessory Distributor"", and got a Motorola battery made in 2008.The battery worked though, but I worried its reliability and sent it back.Just be clear:I haven't had usage experience with this battery as listed picture."
2,Mzs,"I was disappointed in this battery. It is more expensive than many other ones shown on the Amazon website for RZAR phones, however, it does not hold a charge very long. It lasts less than one day. I have paid $3.00 for a Motorola battery that lasts longer. I have depleted and recharged it several times with no improvement."
5,"Works great - much better than the supposed ""OEM"" batteries.",Battery works great. Took a couple of charging cycles to get up to full capacity but it goes the better part of a week on a charge now just like the original battery did before it wore out. I've bought some batteries before that were supposedly OEM Motorola batteries and maybe they were at one point but they were either old worn out ones or they were knockoffs as they would barely last a day before going dead.
2,Poorly Written...,"This book does have some valuable information in it, but it is a very poorly written book. The information given could have been reduced to about 1/3 what is there. Too many repeats of the same stuff. I would not recommend this for people who are already responsible for taking crime scene photographs. This book does not flow while reading it. It's as if the author is trying to prove he is ""smart""."
3,Just for the test,I think that it is ridiculous to pay almost full hard-copy price for the Kindle version of the book. What am I paying for? The content leaves much to be desired. The only reason I am purchasing this book is because it is required reading for the IAI testing. I read edition 1 and I had to force myself to get through the book because it is so uninteresting.
2,Im Having Troubles With This Game.,"I'm afraid I had many difficulties playing this game. I tried running this on my desktop which uses windows 7 but it didn't work. I ran it on a older system and works beautifully! I love this game and it was a huge part on my childhood but I wish it ran on some of the newer systems.Sincerely,Dgeo200026"
3,Just another record company ploy,"I had to give it 3 stars because I am a huge Collin Raye fan. All these songs are excellent songs, and Mr. Raye is an awesome artist and performer, but this is just another last ditch, feeble attempt by Sony Epic records to make a buck off an artist that is no longer under contract to them. They released ""Superhits"" last spring and now this one after Collin had left them. There are now 3 greatest hits CDs with basically the same songs on them. If you are a Collin Raye fan, support him by not supporting Epic records."
3,Yeah,"Ok, I got this ablum to add up to my collection. I wanted to have all his cd's, and this one and (SuperHits) were a total. I mean come on, you can't do this to a man who created so many great hits. If you do plan to get ONE greatest hits then get DIRECT HITS, it come with a multimedia videos and audios. Only get this record if you can find it less than 10.00."
5,16 Biggest Hits Colin Raye,"Loved the CD!Bought it especially to hear ""One Boy One Girl"" for a potential song for use at our son's wedding in October."
3,Not as good as the review of the Swiss,"Having read the xenophobe's guide to the Swiss, and having lived in England, I truly hoped to get a real hoot out of this book. However, it was not nearly as irreverant as the Swiss book, which was a double whammy to me because that is EXACTLY what is so dear about the British people!! However, most of the points are valid and if you're simply looking for some clues about how to behave when visiting England, this book is probably pretty good for you."
4,Good reference - mostly in black and white,"This is a solid reference work, one of a series, thick as a phone book, and full of information. I was unfamiliar with this book, now being reissued, and so was surprised (and a little disappointed) at the fact that it has precious few color plates. The zillions of illustrations are for the most part reproductions of contemporary 1920's ads and other published materials - and so are in black and white. There is an enormous amount of good material in this book - furniture, houses, and a lot of decorative and/or functional objects - but the casual reader (someone who is not a confirmed history-of-design maven) would be helped by having seen the artifacts in another venue - whether in museums, private collections, or in color photographs. This is a great resource for readers who are familiar with, and committed to, the subject."
3,Good for a 10 year old,"I appreciated that it had enough information without getting too involved with older/more complicated topics. It was cute and easy to read, so it was comfortable for my daughter."
4,Very Good Information,"I remember when I was a little girl and my mom reading this book to me. I purchased it for my daughter so we could have ""the talk"", which she felt was torturous, but I still think that the book is great! Easy to read, relevant information without being overwhelming."
5,Your Kids Need This!,"The likelihood is that kids will not go to their parents requesting information and advice on personal topics such as puberty, no matter how close of a relationship between the child and the parent. Even Judy Blume, someone who gets questions from kids all over the world, says that her own kids are reluctant to come to her. Whether we want to admit it or not, kids prefer to learn from their friends and reading. I gave this and other similar books to my son, instructing him to read them if he wanted to learn and to feel free to ask questions. As a result, my son, now an adult, developed a great understanding of these matters and can discuss these topics without fear of being embarrassed and/or being wrong. It's great if you plan to talk with your child. However, be sure to supplement the talk with books he/she can read on their own. I strongly recommend this book."
4,Good but Old,"I believe this is a good book. It is very helpful in teaching kids about puberty. But the problem is the book is outdated. The ages need to be lowered a little because nowadays, kids are going through puberty earlier. Girls have their period at age 9-10 on average and age 8-9 if they are early. Boys go through puberty on average at age 10-11 and age 9-10 if they are early. I know this because of things told to me from my friends from when they were younger and from myself. I personally went through puberty right after I turned 9 years old. If the book was updated a little, I would give the book five stars."
4,"Old fashioned, yet relevant......","This book is definately meant for the ""tween"" age. This is a good beginning book for the early questions. It is a frank, descriptive book without being too graphic and detailed. It was first written years ago, so some people might think it is old fashioned and/or childishly written; this though, is what makes it good for the tweens."
5,Just what I wanted,"We have ""where did I come from"", and I love it, so purchased this for the next level of instruction. Seems to be just what I needed. Great language, good detail. Didn't scare my 10 year old, so it seems to be just right."
1,Can't believe they still write books like this,""".....best for girls to dismiss the warnings of their well meaning relatives about 'the curse'..... small inconvient fact of life"" - the author quotes Dr. Earl Cooperman. And then referring to menses the author writes ""... those few inconvenient days each month,......... make you .......... depressed and grouchy... ...periods are more of a chore than a pleasure."" Why even write phrases like these? As I read this to my 10 year old daughter I found myself flustered as I couldn't even repeat the words. Finally i put the book down .............."
2,Pick another book.,"Written by the same person who wrote the bestselling ""Where Did I Come From?"" (see Picture Books), this book has fine content, but fails to appeal to its older target audience. At this point, most children have probably outgrown the laugh-out-loud-about-puberty stage, and would prefer a more earnest, straightforward tack. Try Lynda Madras' titles for boys and girls, or ""It's Perfectly Normal."""
1,Hated the pictures!,"If you are looking for a very graphic explanation with crudely drawn pictures, this is the book for you. I like to view the birds and the bees as something beautiful and this book is definitely not that. I did not pass it along to my child."
2,OK,I wouldn't recommend this book it is OLD and out of date.The book was in excellent condition though.
5,Excellent group of plays,"I have enjoyed the plays of Ms. Rebeck over the years and am glad to see them compiled in one book. I was fortunate enough to see ""Spike Heels"" in New York with Kevin Bacon and Tony Goldwyn. My favorite play is ""View of the Dome"" with its uncanny parallels to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Ms. Rebeck's plays are always insightful and thought-provoking. I hope one day to see Volume 2 of her plays."
3,Can be better,"I liked because at least there are explanation before started with the worksheets.As they only issued paperback version, make it heavy, costly and obsolete."
5,Book review,This is a great book. Very easy for my son to follow. Is helping to keep him on track before going into sixth grade and helps retain what he learned in fifth grade. I'd highly recommend this book.
5,Curriculum Book for FTCE testing,These are great books. They have wonderful work sheets and I am using them to better understand what is on the FTCE tests. They will be great books to have upon teaching as well.
5,Great!,Could not have asked for Better! As described! Thank you! Would not hesitate to buy again from this seller! AAA+
5,Great Book,"I love this book for my home schooled six grader. The organization, by subject (math, reading comprehension, etc.)and unit studies is wonderful. It is a great supplement to her online curriculum."
3,Deceptively Simple,"""Notebook of Anton Chekov"" records everyday thoughts that clearly do not reflect the complexity of his novels. Some of the entries are boring, others ridiculous, but to him they were obviously worth writing down. Reading the notebook added to the mystery of how a great writer's mind works."
2,"Great potential, .poorly done","This booked needed an editor. Bad punctuation, missing words/letters -- but most of all, written in a boring and amateurish style. What a shame -- since the story, based in truth, is very compelling. The presentation and style just got in the way of my being truly moved by this story, when it should have been a service to its characters and content. I'm guessing that this was a self-published vanity effort. Clearly good editing adds so much to important novels.This should have been a book I raved about and recommended. Unfortunately, it's not."
1,It [DISAPPOINTED]!!,When I bought it it worked for like 10 mins. I couldnt even figer out how to work it. It came with BAD instructions. It even takes batteries. DONT GET IT!!!!
2,Fun but...,"As a pinball sim, this games falls way short. I hoped that the programers would have been able to come up with a better physics model for the game then what they included. Many targets were too difficult to hit due to the balls tendency to only go in a handful of trajectories no matter where on the flipper the ball was or the speed at which the ball was going. The rumble option ended up being annoying at best. Thank god it can be turned off or yo can pull out the battery).I love playing pinball, but I set this down after the first day."
4,More for older players,"I bought this for my 6 year old. He prefers the red and yellow versions of the Pokemon game (and can now import those Pokemon into the N64 Pokemon Stadium game).However, I started playing this and quite enjoy it. I guess I'm old enough to have experienced hanging round pubs and playing pinball in my misspent university days, so purely on a nostalgia basis, a pinball game is atttractive! This is a good one.The rumblepak feature to me, in all honesty, doesn't add much, but then it doesn't detract either...just a harmless gimmick really.Fun, when you want a change from Tetris or PacMan! END"
3,Pokemon,My grandson did not like this game and it broke within about 4 days from taking it out of gameboy! please people stay away from used gameboy games they break very easy! So if u want to buy a gameboy game please buy a new one this is highly recommended . This is important!! Please don't buy used in gameboy games u will be dissapointed!!!KC
4,If you like pinball and Pokemon...,"Quite simply put, this game is addicting. It takes large amounts of skill to acquire all 150 pokemon and the bonus stages keep injecting fun change-ups into the play. Not to mention there are two considerably different playing levels (red/blue), both of which you have to master to get all the pokemon. Also the high-scores are nice for the competitive player. The built-in rumble pack is a cute feature, though it is nice that it is optional (you can play the game sans rumble withuot using the extra AAA battery). And speaking of technical specs, it was SUCH a nice surprise that the game works fine on my Gameboy Pocket that I accidentally bought it for in addition to the Gameboy Color that is says it is for on the package.Overall: great game to take a step back to simpler times, might not be robust/involved enough to pay top-dollar for though."
4,You may like it or not,"Pokemon Pinball for the Game Boy Color is not the best game in the world. If you like pinball, do not get frustrated easily, and like hand held systems, you will positivly love the game. I love it, but I sometimes get frustrated when the ball goes down the hole between the bumpers. Like I said, isn't the best, but it is pretty good. If you like graphics, you will like it, guaranteed."
4,"Good game, but it does get boring",It makes you very frustrated when you make a mistake that itjust doesn't seem worth playing after about a half-hour.
1,NO GOOD,I think that the game is not that fun because all that you do is just flip the ball up and down on the screen.
1,I bought this game and it was so stupid!,"I bought Pokemon Pinball just because of Pikachu. The box has Pikachu on it and it looks stupid. Anything with Pikachu or a Poke Ball is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid and this game has Pikachu sitting in a Poke Ball. That is even stupider. I thought Pikachu disliked Poke Balls. He didn't seem to care about being in a Poke Ball in Red and Blue or in this game he shouldn't be in a Poke Ball either. I hate Pikachu and Pikachu is on the box for this game! He isn't on the stinking rumble cartridge thank god. I played and Pikachu was on the start screen. I closed my eyes and picked Game Start. I picked a table and started in Viridian Forest. I found a Pokemon in Catch Em Mode. It was Pikachu! I took out the game and sold it! The Pokedex is the worst and Pikachu isn't only on the box and start up screen, he is also in the game itself. I sold this game because of Pikachu and I hate it and always will!"
4,An Enjoyable Title For Everyone,"I admit I am not a fan of the Game Boy but I found that I was constantly borrowing my borther's to play this game. The graphics are pretty good, especially for a handheld, the sound also good for a cartridge game. The most impressive thing about the game is that the idea of catching all of the different Pokemon has been integrated into the pinball. If you're a fan of pinball and Pokemon this is one title you shouldn't miss. (note #1 make sure to read the handbook before playing.) (note #2 this game comes with a rumble pack that is attached to the cartridge."
4,Great game,"If the US version is anything like the Japanese version of Pokemon Pinball, and I'm sure it is, except for those funky Japanese names, this game will be addictive. The Rumble Feature is awesome and adds to the game. This game is definately not Pokemon (except for the characters) and is a very different approach to the RPG game. But, there are concepts like capturing, evolving, and the basic Pokemon-ness of the game.While it's a great pinball game on it's own merits, if the person who's getting this game isn't even remotely interested in Pokemon, save him face and buy him Full Tilt or another Pinball game without Poke-balls and Pikachu."
3,Pretty Good,"It is very changing yet fun. It had choices of red or blue. Blue usually has more common pokemon and red has more rare pokemon. I prefer this game over red, bleu and gold and silver"
4,This is a fun game!,Pokemon Pinball is so much fun! My finace's son brought it overone weekend. He had rented it at Blockbuster. I am now hooked and want to go buy it. The reason I give it only four stars is that I would like to have more than two tables. I would think with today's technology that this could be achieved easily- please add more tables!
1,Disappointing - an unscientific hodge podge,"Mr Heinrich is touted on the inside back cover as a scientist. Maybe so, but he didn't bring much science to bear on this book. It is a thinly disguised peon to Barry Sears' work on the Zone, with a lot of personal anecdote and opinion thrown in. The bibliography is telliing - too many popular articles and not too much science. I have nothing against Sears' work - in fact I'm a fan - but this adds nothing to the genre. And boy did I get sick of the phrase 'pasta, pasta, pasta'!"
4,One of two best.,"Turn of the Cards and Ashes are Burning are the highlight of this band's recording output. Three cuts in particular are standouts, Running Hard, Black Flame, and Mother Russia. Annie Haslem's voice is remarkable for its range and power which she used to great dramatic effect without succumbing to vocal histrionics. The band compliments her nicely without overplaying. The only flaw can be found with the occassional lyric which may bring forth a wince or two from the listener. Renaissance had a unique sound that drew heavily from british folk tradition while allowing for a fresh creative approach. Sadly, as time progressed and they attempted to update their sound they eventually lost that which made them unique. This album is highly recommended...Simon"
4,Top flight Classical Folk Rock,"Turn of the Cards is my favorite CD of Renaissance. Annie Haslam has a great voice and the instrumentation is interesting and quite melodic. Running Hard is the standout cut, with Black Flame and Mother Russia close seconds. My only complaint is So Cold is Being Lonely since it is such a direct classical ripoff. But this is a comparatively minor quibble."
4,The Beast In The Beauty,"Something funny happened on the way to this third album (fifth, if you count the original line-up's two records). The ersatz, chirpy optimism of the first two albums has been replaced by a darker and less circumspect vision. When Haslam sings ""Know you're dying all the time"" in ""Running Hard"" there is no allegory--it's a piece of advice, and the intimations of mortality hit home despite the soaring melody. (By the way, the stately, majestic raga-coda to that song is arguably the band's finest recorded moment. Absolutely beautiful.) Likewise, ""Black Flame"" and ""Cold Is Being"" (what would Albinoni think?) manifest a side of the band the first two albums barely hinted at, a side which renders ""I Think Of You"" irrelevent and gives the lie to ""Things I Don't Understand."" Sound like they understand better than ever, actually, and have left Wordsworth behind, at least for a while."
5,Beautifully written essays convey wide range of emotions,"The author's writings display his keen wit, intelligence and extraordinary insight into our thought processes. Extremely enjoyable and entertaining essays on a wide variety of subjects. Many are very touching and sensitive and others make you laugh out loud at the satirical descriptions of people and events. Highly recommended reading for all."
4,Gold Binding Posts,"I was looking for posts to use in a car stereo installation. The product is very good quality but I was surprised at the small diameter of the post mounting stud...fine for most electronic project needs, not what I wanted for my 10"" woofer wiring."
3,Frontier - 'Sulture' (Perishable) EP,"Frontier is a Chicago based trio whose members include Stephen Wessley-guitar,Kevin Ireland-bass and Michael Tsoulos-drums.'Sulture' is actually a six-track 30 minute EP.But considering the asking price,it's a real steal.Some might label this CD as indie rock or perhaps trance noise rock.Either way,it's a decent find.The tunes that I found most enlightening were the techno like ""Nutley 10"",the somewhat atmospheric ""Aether"" and ""Strong City""(the disc's only song with actual vocals).Just might appeal to fans of Spectrum,The Verve,Spiritualized and possibly the Flaming Lips."
4,Surprisingly simple but effective,"Well it's not mechanical like I somehow got in my mind, but it gets the job done. At first I was a little annoyed because all uses is a ball to make your breaths a little shorter but I refrained from posting a review right away to do this little thing the justice it deserves. I'd recommend it if you're willing to keep an open mind."
4,Gag gift for a friend,"This showed up in my gold box one day and it seemed like a funny gag gift for a friend of mine, so I bought it. We've all had a good laugh about it and she enjoys doing her breathing exercises daily."
5,amazed,"I'm amazed that this is working, but it is. It's only been a couple of weeks, and already my breathing muscles (which, who knew I had?) are stronger. Two thumbs up, or should I say lungs up? Har har!"
4,Convenient and easy to use,"I got my Ultrabreathe a few weeks ago and started using it as part of training for the NY marathon. I found it easy to use. I could feel that my breathing muscles were working harder. After a few times, I learned to breath out slower so I wouldn't build up too much oxygen from the deep inhaling. My only complaint is that saliva drips out of the device. Not a big problem, but I wish it had some kind of containment system."
3,Overpriced,Excellent product. Works as advertised. As a competitive bicyclist it helped me get up from an average of 76 rpm cadence to 85 inj one month. It is way overpriced however and there are other copies on the internet $15 cheaper and with free shipping.
2,broke 2nd day i had it,"This item came missing the middle screw piece. Worked great until the end broke on the second day of use. I really did not expect much so not an overwhelming disappointment, but it was still frustrating. Aside from the missing piece, it was shipped and delivered quickly. I wouldn't waste time on this item again though."
3,Needed this item to help my lungs....,"I've had two spontaneous pneumothorax's... My lung collapsed twice. Cardio has since become difficult. I wanted this item to assist in building my lungs up to be able to run longer distances. So far, not that impressed. The mouth piece makes drooling inevitable. If you're sitting down or facing down, the Ultrabreathe will collect your drool inside the bottom piece... Gross. So you have to be looking forward or slightly looking up to avoid your drool pooling up. Gross. The Ultrabreathe does make breathing difficult, causing resistance.... So it does work."
4,nice product but pricey,"I use if for warming up for sporting events - very small, durable and very effective for breathing exercises. However, seems quite overpriced for a few pieces of plastic."
3,Seems to work if you can stand the smell/taste!,"Like a few reviewers have noted, there is a terrible plastic/vinyl smell and taste to the mouthpiece. I've aired and soaked the mouthpiece in baking-soda/water overnight and the smell and taste it leaves is still bad. I would think twice before buying this particular item again. Hopefully with time this will disipate. I've removed the mouthpiece and used it without for now, still works ok, and time will tell if it increases lung capacity/function. The deep breathing exercises have seemed to help a little so far."
4,Excellent little device,"I'm an athsmatic so I of course have impaired lung function. I bought this hoping for a marginal increase. However I recieved a significant increase in lung function in a little less than two weeks of using it. Now during heavy bag work my arms get tired before I run out of breath which was the exactly the opposite of before. It would've been 5 stars but there is no way to lock the resistance ring. However that's not a problem. If you're looking to increase lung function, buy it!"
5,Great and Durable,"This product works great. It is a great warmup before running or weightlifting. My mile time has decreased by 1:27 faster than just running alone. I say durable because my cats tried chewing it up and it survived unlike powercords, shoes, and clothing. (I know my cats are wierd)"
3,same info,the info in this book seemed the same as whats been printed over and over if you read alot about juicing...recipes the same too...:(.....didnt feel i learned anything new
4,"This book is for novice juicers, but has merit","Jay is the man! Seriously, the dude has gotten million into juicing. That being said, he markets his stuff for the masses and focuses too heavily on fruit juices. Probably because that is what tastes good to people.Most of the hardcore juice advocates will tell you to steer clear of fruit juicing and stick with vegetables only. There is a wealth of good information in this book and some good recipes, but my advice is lay off the fruit and stick with vegetables. Fruits are easy to eat and digest, vegetables are not. You can blend fruits in smoothies, veggies you cannot. Juicers are for vegetables, I think you are catching my drift by now..."
2,Caveat Emptor,"This book is a rip off. I bought this book for the recipes and was extremely disappointed. Entire pages are dedicated to common sense recipes such as Apple Juice (2-3 apples), Orange Juice (2-3 oranges), Pineapple Juice, Carrot Juice, Cantaloupe Juice, etc., etc. If that wasn't bad enough they waste paper by printing one recipe per page, when they could easily fit 4 recipes per page. I suggest saving your money and searching the internet for better tasting and more expansive recipes."
3,Juicey Book,"Jay Kordich's book is a good intro to juicing. I had a copy out from the library for the longest time, and kept referring back to it. Finally, I have my own. Nice addition to my health food library."
4,great information about fruits and veggie's,This is a simple but informative book. I have just about read every page. Although I mix more veggie's than in any of the recipies in one drink and still seem to always make more than I can drink. It has given me a lot of great information about what to do that is important and some really great what not to do things that I never knew. I use it to refer to when I can't remember something about a veggie or mixing things together even though I don't really use the recipies as they are described.
3,needs more variation of recipes.,"Jay knows his stuff, no doubt about it. I enjoyed the part on nutrition and juicing for healing. I mainly juice vegetables instead of fruits because fruits are loaded with fructose (sugar). The vegetable juice recipes lack variation and are all based on carrots: carrot & apple, carrot & celery, carrot & cabbage, and combination of both, etc.. Now, these are wonderful juices and I love them but I'm trying to juice everyday and drinking carrot juice gets to be too much. I wouldn't mind recipes which involve all kinds of veggies. I did agree with the author on buying organic produce whenever possible and he tells you why. All in all this is a decent juicing book with simple recipes."
1,"Their idea of ""good condition"" vastly varies from mine","The book was completely discolored and it smelled. I felt like I should wear gloves before touching it, ugh! As to the contents, Juiceman is an extremist. Well-meaning folks trying to improve their eating habits are left feeling that if they don't drink 10 gal of arugula juice daily, they're bound for an early demise. This guy discourages anybody who wants to juice but take baby steps into the journey. Get the Jack LaLane book instead."
1,The vendor that send this book.,"I WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN. I PAID FOR WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A HARDBACK BOOK. I RECEIVED A $6.99 PAPERBACK BOOK. I PAID 25.00 FOR A 6.99 PAPERBACK. WHEN I TRIED TO RETURN IT, THE COMPANY WOULD NOT TAKE IT BACK. I WAS TOTALLY RIPPED OFF. NEXT TIME I WILL GO TO THE BOOKSTORE."
4,Good for your health,Had this book and somehow lost it so this is a replacement. Love juicing as an add-on to my healthy diet. Jay has some very good and tasty combinations; sometimes I use them as he recommends and other times I experiment.
5,best thing you can do for your self,this book is the most informative book to buy esp when first starting to juice. I had bought one 18 years ago. Then I lost it and bought this one to replace it. He is a living example of what juicing can do & he gives you details of how to get the most from the book.You will refer to the book over & over. You will find that is it the best thing you can do for your self
4,Wonderful,I purchased the book for my husband who has fallen in love with juicing. The book helped him to learn the various recipes to meet his specific needs.
4,"Great price, nice looking glasses",These were a great price and have a very classic look that will outlast the trends. They are a little heavy on the face and sit low on the nose which can be a little uncomfortable when it's very hot out. Overall they look pretty nice and the lenses are large and of good quality to protect your eyes.
5,Nice Separator,This is easy to put together and looks great. Just as pictured. I used it for my parents 50th Anniversary cake. I covered each layer in white fondant and put three colors of pink fondant roses around each layer. I then wrapped the separator with wide gold ribbon and used two straight pins to stick it to the foam. It looked great!
5,Great,ordered this for my sons new sentra. Delivery was fast and it looked better than expected. Silver plate was shiny and expensive looking.
3,The disk opens a window on a great performer and man,"Pablo Casals was a noted cellist of the middle 20th Century, made more famous by his refusal to return to his native Spain while the Franco regime and its inheritors were in power. This disk is important because it opens a window for many who never heard Casals. He has an obvious reverence for music of Johann Sebastian Bach in particular. I never found Casals' cello style equal to his impressive personality in terms of musical excitement - though the limits of recording of his time affect perceptions of his playing today. I highly respect his ethics, and his unaffected approach to music. How many cellists today (besides Yo Yo Ma) feel they can afford to play other than technically demanding works? Casals, as we note, had no problem playing simple unaffected melodies. He did so without sentimentalizing them."
4,Excellent,"This is an excellent resource of information that has lead me to other sources. It was well worth my purchase. It is written in a language that only professionals may understand, but that was the intention. Thank you."
3,Waitaminute...,"I'll start off by sayin although I'm olny giving this three stars, popular music would be fantastic if music of this caliber was the standard. That said, this CD is really kind of a one trick pony. I loved ""Everybody Got Their Somethin'"" and thought it was the best record released by a female that year because she flowed from rock to soul to blues seamlessly without compromising her style. On this CD, she kind of sticks to basicly the same type of thing. That combined with the two throwaways ""Funkier Than a Mosquitas Tweeter"" and (dare I say) ""Fatherless Child"", make a funky but uninteresting record. There is very little replay value because once youv'e heard it, you got it. ""Happy in The Morning"" and ""I Gotta Know"" are great songs, as is ""Swing it Around"" and you get your moneys worth. I guess I just expected this to be something that would be in my CD player for days, it wasn't."
3,A few good songs,"A little diappointing. Sometimes she has the most amazing voice but, on this one most of the faster songs she gets too screechy. Slow songs are nice."
3,"Works great, but they don't last","This lights are great. I am a truck driver and they are very useful and give a lot of light. The only thing is that they burn out quickly. One bulb lasts approximately three weeks, sometimes less."
5,Wow!!,"What an incredible game! While it is very easy to start playing C3, the game is amazingly intricate and has something to challenge any player. If you are able to make it through the career campaign, then you can check out some of the great fansites on the website for literally hundreds of player-created scenarios.If you are looking for a time machine, this is the game for you! Many times I have sat down in the evening for ""just a short session"", only to realize a ""few minutes"" later that the sun was coming up!"
5,beautiful game but,"Hi, i am SRIKANTH from india.I am one of the lover of caesarIII demo game.I allways used to play this game in my pc.But that is not full version.I got that as a free game cd on purchasing of a computer related magzine.To day i visited the official site of caesar demo game .But i found there is no chance to buy the full demo game outside of US country.I was seacrhing every shop in our country for the game.But i am unable to get it.Here in the site there is no chances for BUY the game as an out sider of US."
3,Caesar 3 is a classical city building game that is hours of fun,"Caesar 3 is a classic city building game that is hours of fun, making your city conform to the terrain, avoiding the plague, military excursions, it is all great fun."
5,A classic,"Splendid game. Go back every few years to play it and relive the memories. Another one was Unreal Tournament. Beware, this requires more brain power than your usual 1st person action game."
5,I want to be Caesar!...,"Totally addictive. Gets very hard in the upper levels since when you start planning your Roman province it's hard to imagine it as a huge thriving city. I've never had the money problems other gamers here describe, but the prosperity requirements at the upper levels are extremely difficult. It's a blast though to watch your city grow and to make it a place where people like to live. In spite of its faults, it's great fun deciding where to build things, what industry to get going first, and how to defend your city. The graphics are beautiful and you get a real sense of appreciation for what it must have been like to live in a city with no cars, movie theaters or telephones. And at [the price], you can't beat the value!"
3,"Okay, But Could Be Alot Better","I love studying the Romans and when I heard of this game I bought it. When I played it, it was great! but then it got boring and way to repetitive. All the game is, is making houses, build farms, honor Caesar that is about it. If you love simulation games get this game. If you don't like simulation games don't get it."
2,Too diificult,"I really liked this game at first, but the I got further and further along and found that I couldn't get past a certain level, no matter which choice I took. The game wasn't too expensive, but I upgraded to Windows XP and now it doesn't work. My recommendation is not to buy it."
1,WTFx1000@aol.com???!?!?,"First, the good. The shipping was VERY FAST. Package arived in less than a week. And the game is a blast. ^_^ Now the bad. What I got wasn't what I was expecting. I had placed an order on a NEW copy of the game, but what I got was some sort of reprint from a company in the UK. Putting the disk in the drive caused my firewall to go nuts (I DON'T LIKE HAVING SPY-WARE SENT TO ME!!!) and when I tried to exit the install, it cut off my internet connection. Now why would it want to do that? Also, the boxart that is shown online ISN'T the same box that I got. I liked the game, but was not pleased with all the extra crap that was put on the disk. >=("
4,"If you like simulations , you will love this game","This is a great game for sim fans, it is also great for people who who enjoy games with historical themes. The sound does not work that great on my machine , every so often it will just stop working. I also do not like the fact that when I am playing this game it does not allow me to leave to while it is still running. When they make an announcement it will not go away until you tell it to, so when you leave the action will stop in less then 5 minutes."
3,Fun game,"This could be a great game, and it IS a lot of fun, but as an avid Pharoah gamer, it was hard to negotiate the water supply, which uses a series of aquaducts. Other than that, its fun, historical, and a good lesson in economics."
3,A decent game if you like building cities.,"The graphics aren't exactly wonderful, but if you like Age of Empires style games without having to worry about as much military action, this would be a good game for you. You can determine how much military action you wish to have, and what's also handy is if you don't like any of the scenarios, you can go to sierra and download a map building feature. All in all, for the price, it's an enjoyable game. If you think you might enjoy Pharoah and Cleopatra, check out the bundled version."
4,Very good game,"I got this game after purchasing and becoming adicted to Pharoah. C III is as fun as pharoah. However, you must be a little more careful about fires and the colapse of buildings in C-III.Game is very similar to Pharoah of course, but doesn't matter. The graphics are good and the quality of game play is also just as good.The scenarios are not nearly as difficult as ol Pharoah, but still I enjoy this game very much."
2,immature and poorly set up,"maybe it's because i bought it at the same time as pharaoh.. but i was disappointed with this game's poor design.. it really lacks the potential intricacies that pharaoh has.. .. swap ancient egypt for rome, you'll be much happier."
5,Great Game!,"I absolutely loved this game! Its soooo addicting! And you will always want to do ""just"" two minutes more! Its also very hard which keeps you interested and challenged. Overall this is a very good game and as a bonus makes you want to learn about Rome!"
4,good game,"Graphics are very real looking, the sound is alright. There are many things that you can select to build your very own Rome. It is one of my personal favorite games. It is worth your time and money."
4,A fun game,"This is a very historic game. You can actualy get real cities and after you get done with a few goals its on to the next level but dont get me wrong this is a tuff game. I get discouragedged and feel like beating the crap out of my computer sometimes. If your good enough you can actually get to be caesar. I have never goten to be caesar,hey but nobody's perfect except for God right."
3,So you want to run a Roman city...,"For those of you looking for a great, realistic and HARD game here it is. You are selected by Rome to run a series of cities, each one with problems and needs different than the last. You will have to develop farms, dig clay pits, fill warehouses, design road systems, supply people with food and goods, build houses, set up markets, workhouses and make sure everybody has clean water. THAN you also have to deal with trade, enemy armies, the Gods and Caesar's own demands for supplies and legions! People will want doctors on call, schools for their kids and theaters for their free time. Businesses will need labor living near them, easy to access docks, roads, warehouses and don't forget lots of enginers to keep things in repair!Oh, and don't forget the walls, towers and gatehouses!And lots of roads, gardens, roads, plazas and more roads.Don't worry, there is a easy setting. And you can turn off the Gods too. Try to take it slow and easy."
5,Another brilliant strategy game!,"Caesar 3 is unstoppable! You can play it a million times and each game will be different. The cities in the game can be huge, one of my cities covered the whole map.The game is very easy to play, you have to build a Roman empire, and take care of it's residents. You have to build loads of things, like schools, libraries, theatres, markets, farms etc.A cool effect of the game is that every person says something when you right click on them. I had fun just by doing that in a city. Sometimes in the game, Caesar sends you requests and if you don't fulfill them, he gets angry and chucks you out the city, taking away your place of mayor.You only get 500 in money (i can't remember the name for money in the game) and if you use it too quickly Caesar gets angry.There's loads of disasters in the game - like fires, building collapses, riots and disease.Overall, a jam packed game that you will not get bored of. Play and become Caesar!"
5,Best game Ive ever played!!,This game is amazing!! Its beautifully designed and most suitable for all ages. I guess it develops our organising and managing skills too.
2,Review of Royal Secret Bath Perfume,It dos not even come close to Germaine Montiel's formula. It does not have the basic scent of Royal Secret Bath Oil. I will not order it again.Jeanne Donnelly
2,Not as good as other books on the subject,"I was really looking forward to this book, and unfortunately con not find much to recommend about it. The listings are woefully incomplete and many times inaccurate. Photography is only so-so, and is mainly filled with items from the local Toys-R-Us. A better book to get would be ""The Unauthorized Guide to Godzilla Collectibles"". The one bright spot is the 14 pages on Gamera, which while could be better is finally altogether under one cover."
1,Bad.,"This is not the first price guide on these toys. Sean Linkenback's was the first and much better than this.... Ms./Mr. Cain should research the subject before saying what prices are. Linkenback is a respected dealer of Japanese toys and thus infitely more qualified for an endeavor such as this. Cain, you should take a research class."
4,"Tons of gameplay! Yet, not the greatest.","I can tell you that Jet Force Gemini has lots of re-play value, but not the kind that always makes you WANT to replay it. Sometimes it makes you replay some of the places that you are bored of your mind of, but at least it offers you many challenges: Tribals; Hidden Multiplayer stuff; Floyd Courses; Secret Items (Health Inc.). There is so much to this game, it seems nearly impossible to find all of the stuff. Overall, this game is great and the graphics are beutiful. The choppy controls may give you some uncalled challenge, but don't worry, you'll get used to the straffing and aiming controls. If you have endurance and love adventure games, then strap yourseleves in boys! Because your going in for a...you know...ride."
3,Uakward,I played this game at my friends house. I thought that someone without experience couldn't even understand the controlls. I guess it could be a fun game if you played it alot
3,A 12 year old gamer,"This game has the worst adventure mode of any game I've everplayed, It kind of boring and too fast pace, but the multiplayer is awesome the camera view isn't the best but theworlds are very good the weapon variation is great but theadventure sort of ruins it only buy the game if you havesomeone to play it with you."
4,This is definetly one of the best games i've played in 1999!,"If you like saving the universe from evil and collecting stuff along the way,then jet Force Gemini is for you!"
2,boring....,"if i had reviewed this game 3 months ago,i would have given it 5 stars. what can i say? i lost interest.i mean c'mon!there is absolutely no storyline at all.the point of the game is to run around killing bugs and rescuing teddy bears.fun at first-but wait for some thing better to come out."
1,Do they have any lower ratings?,"Could there be a worse game? Jet Force Gemini is highly overrated, it has bad graphics, the choice range for the weapons is small, and it has horrible control. ...I would rate this gave with a half star if I could!"
2,Jet Flop Gemini,"Jet Force Gemini, a space alien (bug) shoot em' up. In the beginning of the game, you start out slaughtering Mizar's evil forces. Soon the game progresses to nothing but puzzles with little action. Camera angles constantly leave people laying on the ground wondering what hit them. The auto-aim feature is terrible compared to Goldeneye 007's auto-aim. JFG's auto-aim switches camera angles while making your character face a certain way making it hard to explore other areas. To deactivate the auto-aim you must run away from the foe while letting him pummel you just to leave the room. The limited arsenal makes killing the bugs boring FAST. In my opinion, choose a different game such as Goldeneye 007 or Winback."
3,ok game,"This game is pretty cool, but I think the game is way to long. It is also a little hard to control your person. some good things are that you have awsome weapons and things like jetpacks and other hidden items. Overall, I would rate this game a 3 out of a 5."
2,Well it's good BUT....,"After tearing my hair out for several hours, I came to a conclusion. JFG is a good game, but it's simply no fun to play. Unlike other Rare games like Donkey Kong 64, Bango-Tooie and Perfect Dark, JFG seems more like a challenge than a game: a challenge to see how good you are at video games. If you're a pro, this should be a lot of fun. But for everybody else like me, it gets VERY tedious. And unlike DK-64, Perfect Dark or Banjo-Tooie, it offers very little replay value.About the rating: It's a ""Teen"" but that mostly counts for bug 'blood'. There's no human blood or profanity."
5,Jet Force Gemini- One great game for the N64,"Jet Force Gemini is awesome! With impressive graphics, music, and play control, and of course its challenging levels, you'll be kicking bug butt in no time. With three characters to play as Juno, who can walk on lava, Vela, the skilled underwater diver and Lupus, the cool flying cyberdog! With its one player, two people cooperative, and four player battle modes you'll be there for quite a while!"
5,COMPLETLEY MIND BLOWING!,"This game is awesome.It can get frustrating at times, especially at the bosses, but if you don't like bugs and want to blow their heads of with homing missles to collect them... Then you better get this game."
5,The best ever! A must have!,"This game is the best! It has an awesome storyline, superb graphics, and dynamite gameplay! This is a must have game for all N64 gamers out there. If being a crack military unit codnamed Jet Force and killing an evil insect lord named Mizar with everything from a rapid-fire machine gun to a Tri-rocket launcher is your thing, the buy Jet Force Gemini NOW!"
5,Another Amazing Game from Rareware,"Jet Force Gemini, one of Rareware's newest releases, is an AMAZING game! The AI is VERY advanced. The enemies don't attack you without any regard for their life, unlike many other games. The graphics are a bit ""pixelated"" (if that is a word), and the animation a bit choppy at points, but this game is still awesome! I've heard many, many complaints that this game is to long. I guess it is rather long, but come on, you don't HAVE to beat it all at once (but if you do, it is rather gratifying!). I have seen no other game this advanced in a while. If you want a great game (and can afford one), you should definetely buy Jet Force Gemini"
4,Another Rare Hit,"Jet force gemini is a superb game that will keep you engrossed for days on end. The levels are vast , graphics superb and characters involving and gameplay intuitive. BUT it is NOT Zelda ,This is far more shoot'em up than RPG. And it hasn't got the same gritty feel or linear gameplayer of Goldeneye (with JFG you sometimes wonder what on earth you supposed to be doing or where you are supposed to go). It is still a great game in it's own right but if your expecting a Zelda or goldeneye sequel you will be disappointed."
3,Made a good gift!,We bought this for our nephew who was 7 at the time. He had a lot of fun with it and his parents loved that it kept him occupied for long periods of time.
4,I am Sam Fischer,"If only they had the cool green glow of the three dots. These look a lot like the goggle that Sam Fischer uses in the Xbox game ""Splinter Cell"", which is also very good btw.They work very well and will last you a long time. While a bit pricey, they're worth it."
3,Not Carr's best Fell book,"I have seen this book on a Top 100 list online, and now that I've read the book I'm quite surprised at that fact. The story takes place on a small college campus in the United States, which takes Carr out of his usual British location. And although Carr is famous for his 'locked room' mysteries, in this case the locked room element of the story takes a back seat to the more typical whodunnit plot. As always in murder mysteries - and more so in locked room/impossible crime stories - just keeping the plot plausible is difficult. In this case, more than once I found myself losing the necessary 'suspension of belief' and thinking 'no, that's not plausible.' Carr always rides on the edge of plausibility, but in this case, he lost me multiple times.Is the book worth reading? Sure, if you're a fan of the genre. Just make sure you read The Burning Court, The Three Coffins, and The Crooked Hinge first."
5,A Great Read,I loved this book. I purchased this for a class on Leadership. It was very informative and inspirational. I would recommend this to others.
5,Excellent Information,"This is an amazing book. I had read the autobiography of Billy Graham before I read this one and I think that made a great difference. I had the background to relate to when reading it. The book gave great examples of leadership and how to implement them. Using, of course, Billy Graham as an example. Very, very good! I would highly recommend it!"
1,SOUL KEEPER,"WHAT A WASTE OF TAPE AND TIME THEY PUT INTO THIS MOVIE, ANYONE WHO SAYS THIS MOVIE IS GREAT NEEDS HELP"
3,Surprisingly entertaining,"This is the type of movie that sounds like it will be incredibly stupid...and it is. In a good way. A cross between ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""The Exorcist,"" this movie borders on parody. The main characters (especially the perennially confused Corey) provide a running commentary on the bizarre action of the movie that any skeptic would enjoy.Obviously, this is a movie best enjoyed at 3 am with one's best friends - not a cinematic masterpiece. It has no redeeming qualities as a work of art, and the catchphrase (""Do you believe in the power of the human soul"") is repeated more times than I could keep count of. Still, it's an entertaining piece of fluff with a surprisingly sweet ending worth seeing once."
4,Great value for 2.5MB,"Easy to use, cool silver color, and best of all is the pricefor a 2.5MB organizer!... The backup function (which nicely backs up ALLyour data)... and the @ symbol nicely placed as a SHIFT to the ""2"" key - just like on your PC - check out the close up the photo yourself. A nice alternative to more expensive Palm organizers - it has free software programs and other cool stuff like football schedules that you can download via the MyWizard site and has a keyboard for those who don't like teaching a machine how to recognize your handwriting. END"
3,LOVE this organizer... but problem with screen,"Ok, this organizer kicks the crap out of all the others I have tried. Palm, Pocket PC, etc...The problem is the screen goes bad. Vertical lines show up. I believe it must be too sensitive to heat. VERY VERY disapointing as this is by far the best organizer I have ever used.Can anyone recommend a similar device without the screen problems???"
1,Dying display + lousy company response = 1 star,"I used to love this product--I even bought four as Christmas gifts! But never again. As another reviewer has complained, the display on my OZ-750 started losing vertical lines of pixels, beginning about 6 months after the 1-year warranty had expired. Eventually I won't be able to read the entries at all. So I called Sharp's technical support folks. I was hoping they'd say that since this is an ongoing and unresolved flaw that directly affects usability, they'd send me the latest model free of charge. Fat chance. They never even acknowledged that this is a recurring problem. Instead, after implying that it was probably my fault for exposing the unit to extreme temperatures, they gave me the number of a third-party repair center. The repair people told me that if the display is bad, the unit can't be fixed. However, if it's a bad circuit board, it can be fixed ... Forget it. I'm done with Sharp organizers. For a few bucks more, I'll buy a Palm."
4,Russia as it is,"Meier writes about the transition pains that Russians have and are experiencing as he travels there from 1995 to 2002. From Chechnya to Sakhalin to Norlisk, Petersburg and Moscow, Meier meets with ordinary and not so ordinary Russians to get a sense of their new post-soviet existence. His knowledge of Russian history and literature makes the book even more interesting as he commonly draws from the past and literature to explain the Russian character. This is by far one of the best accounts on contemporary Russia, a travelogue that gives the reader a real sense of not only what it means to live in Russia today but a good sense of where Russia is headed."
4,A good bargain...,"These are pretty good workouts, though the host goes from move to move somewhat quickly. The first couple of times I used each of these tapes, I gave my rewind button a pretty good workout. THen again, I know I'm pretty uncoordinated. Also, his directions are ""off"" sometimes (he'll say left when he means right), and the people he has working out behind him are terrible. But, overall, the tapes are fun and challenging-- and you don't feel like you're just doing another aerobic tape, since the host really puts emphasis on how these moves work as self-defense."
4,"""Boy Meets World"" and ""The Wonder Years""","For those who don't know about ""Boy Meets World"" it's a 90's adaptatation of the popular 80's show ""The Wonder Years"". The intersting thing about this is that the boy who played the main character in ""The Wonder Years"", Fred Savage, and the boy who played the main character in ""Boy Meets World"", Ben Savage, are brothers in real life. I grew up watching ""Boy Meets World"", and I find that it's probibly the best acting by a teenager I've seen since ""The Wonder Years"".Both shows were real good. The only thing I think that makes ""The Wonder Years"" better was it's ability to really capture the period in which it took place."
5,Education-5 Laughs-50000,"(...) This show is hilarious. Eric is the funniest guy.(only in the adult series. in this dvd he is girl crazy and rarely does something funny). But still, i say this in the words of mr feeny:take this test............or DIE.The test is buying this item. Yes. expensive. but this is the one show that actually matches up to Yu-Gi-Oh! If you don't like Yugioh, don;t worry because this is completely opposite. YOU MUST BUY THIS. BESIDES, WHAT IF THEY QUIT ONCE THESE DVDS ARE OUT? BUT THIS BUY THIS BUY THIS...OR DIE."
2,Broken Case,"I received this DVD and the case was completely shattered. It is non-functional. The CD's themselves are okay so I didn't return it, but the item description did not specify the case was broken, and it was packaged poorly so I assume that was the cause. I didn't pay 3.99 for shipping to have it slapped in a cheap envelope that will cause it to break on the way to it's destination. Please don't use the shipping fee to put extra cash in your pocket. We pay that for a reason."
5,Such a classic.,"This isn't the best season from this show but it's a good start to an amazing series. This season to me is the writers figuring the whole show out (which I guess is how every first season is really, haha). Not the typical problems that sit coms usually have, definitely different than other shows. Just not a fan of the laugh track! Lol, but still works."
2,Ripped Packaging,"I was really excited to get my copy of boy meets world season 1, but when I got it, the DVD although wrapped in plastic had the outside paper ripped. So now the description has a huge hole in it :("
5,Earlier the better,"The earlier episodes (first and second seasons) were fantastic. Morals were taught in goofy, funny ways- and there was no ""love"" complication like in the later episodes. The first season of this show is a MUST HAVE!!! I CAN'T believe it's going to be out on DVD!!!I grew UP on this show!"
5,Boy Meets World is awesome,"Ok, when I found out that Boy Meets World was coming out, I got VERY excited. So I pre-ordered it, and I am happy with it. I love the fact that I now own these episodes and that I don't have to wait for disney to show them.Now, this item is a bit pricey. It is worth it definatley, but I felt that for 45 dollars, that they should have atleast put some more extras. All they put was commentary which was great, but I wanted to see some bloopers. Still, if you are a BMW fan, make sure you add this to your dvd collection the next time you got a spare 45 dollars.Again, the only negatives were the lack of extras. But I will be purchasing season 2."
5,My fav show ever (and soon yours too!),"THIS IS TOTALLY THE BEST SHOW ON EARTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i recommend this to anyone, no matter what age. As soon as you're into the first 5 minutes you'll be laughing so hard that you can't stop for hours! this is the best show that i've ever seen and i cant wait for the rest of the seasons to come out! Buy it to see for yourself!"
5,Rockin'!!!,"I already LOVE Boy Meets World because it is such an awsome show! Being able to relate to this show and being able to learn lessons from this show make it really special. This DVD set was great, although I am personally more attached to the later of the seven seasons this is still a good way to spend your money. The cast commentary is great fun to watch and so are the episodes. Don't listen to anybody who says that this show is stupid because it is those people that will make this world burn."
5,This is the best tv series ever!!!!,"No more dumb re-runs on the Disney channel! Finally I can have Boy Meets World whenever I want. Watching the characters grow up is the best thing about the show. The first season starts off the whole thing. Boy meets girl, boy makes friends and realizes that there is a great big world out there that he needs to discover. I hope its not long before this entire series is on DVD!!1"
3,Problems to view it,I live in Mexico and I have a multiregion DVD Player but I can not see this DVD on the DVD Player.. I have to see it in my computer. The series is so much fun but it does not include Extra Material or a comentary of the actors.
5,FINALY!,"Finaly,the dvd i've been waiting for for 5 months, is here.(in another 6 months)i'm sure that thousands of people have been waiting for this. Once i get season 1,i'll be waiting for season 2. i'm definantly gonna own the entire series once it comes out. i'm sure that when it comes out, it'll be a huge hit! Until then,i'll just watch it on tv."
5,Boy Meets World series one on DVD!!!,I'm so glad that this has been released. Although i already bought it on ebay. It is very funny and it must be the best American comedy ever to be made. It's what I watched when I went to school. I am just waiting for the other episodes to come out on dvd.
5,Boy Meets World is a classic!,I grew up in high school watching this show. The day I graduated high school was the same day the series finale aired. I have followed this show since I was 6 or 7th grade. This first season set will introduce you to Corey (Ben Savage) and his best friend Shawn (Rider Strong) and they battle through every day things teens face in high school. What I thought was great about this show is that Corey lived next door to his teacher and he became a mentor for everyone on the show as the series progressed. I liked Boy Meets World when they got into more serious matter and when Topanga (Danielle Fishel) became a regular. I have never seen season 1's episodes in order but it will be nice to finally have the show I grew up with in high school finally in my own hands. Boy Meets World is one of my favorite shows ever. This is probably the only show that lasted so long that it was there as I battled the same thing all the main characters battle whenever they are in high school.
5,Wonderful Tv Show!,I had a blast watching BMW season 1!It makes me remember my youth! It's always fun to see the adventures of a eleven years old boy!
5,Great!,This arrived in a timely manner. Actually a couple of days earlier than expected. It arrived in great condition and recommend buying from this seller.
1,painful,"This poet was mentioned to me in a conversation. I hadn't been familiar with her before. Reading it, I thought- The author sounds deeply angry. Not in a literary pain sort of way, in an uncomfortable pair of shoes sort of way."
2,I expected more,I picked up this book after hearing about the poet from a friend. It wasn't at all what I expected. The author came across as entitled and elitist.
3,Kwaidan review,"This book is a very readable series of very short storiesof Japan, followed in the latter part of the book by somereflections on the part of the author, a Westerner living inJapan one hundred years ago. It is of interest to read ofsuch cultural diversity, mythology and relgious views.The author's book, IN GHOSTLY JAPAN, was a much better collection of Japanese lore, in that the stories were longerand lent themselves to greater character development andcomplexity. Nevertheless, I know of no other author who translates Japanese myths, and both books are worthwhile."
3,Spooky Old Tales,"This collection of 17 old stories from Japan was collected and translated by a well-known ethnographer, and first published in English in 1904. The tales are old folk stories (urban legends if you will) mostly dealing with ghosts and the spirit world. Many feature the theme of a spirit who takes a human form to disguise their true nature. Another common theme concerns the uneasy spirit who must be appeased in some form. They are fairly charming old-fashioned stories, which vary considerably in length. The final three sections (""Butterflies,"" ""Mosquitoes,"" ""Ants"") are more like meditations on the three subjects and don't really fit into the ghost story theme of the rest of the book. Four of the tales were made into an excellent Japanese movie in 1964."
1,Cheap,Incredibly cheaply made item. Very poor fit & finish. Very strong plastic odor. Battery compartment does not stay closed when in use.
5,Best I've ever had.,"I've had a lot of nose hair trimmers, but this one is the best yet! I've had the lighted Panasonic and the unlighted Panasonic, both of when tend to pull hairs rather than cut. This Angel Sales trimmer beats them all hands down. It actually trims the hairs painlessly and quickly due to its high RPM."
1,Cheap,"Cheaply made. I guess you really do get what you paid for. Worked a few times, then kaput! Stay away."
5,worth every penny and time spent,"this book is just great. i find it a straightforward and no frills book. yet reading it makes business interesting and encouraging. a truly indispensable reference and guide to management, better than any textbook i have come across in terms of giving clarity to the big picture. for that i have huge respect and admiration for peter drucker.peter drucker is just ""the man"" in management in my book."
4,Great from a Job and Organizational design standpoint,"A very encouraging book. A long read, however extremely straight forward. Great from a job and organizational design standpoint. Great insight into ""non-domain-specific know-how for management."" Learn how to ask the right questions about your company. A must read for business."
2,more suited for teens,"I think lthis is more suited for teenagers as it revolves around high school kids. I was hoping for something more for adults. But, I guess if you area teenager, it would be great. For me, I lost interest after third episode."
3,for adults,"Targeted for pre-teen and teen but the sexual themes, scenes and subject matter make what would be a cheesy but fun series unfortunately not appropriate for teens."
4,Still great but some loss with the music changes,"There's nothing to argue about the quality of this show and especially season 1 but those drastic music changes are really a letdown. Especially episode 10 ""Heat Wave"" has gotten a whole makeover, from the beginning which originally used Santana for the steamy Michael/Maria makeout scene to the party and right on to the end where Max and Liz first kiss and the original Gomez song that played - all that has been changed. Personally I just go back to watching my video tapes although the quality on those sucks. Oh well, buy if you don't care about the music stuff, it's still great watching this amazing show."
5,I couldn't stop watching,"I loved Roswell, and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD, but it was worth the wait. I was a bit disappointed at first on reading on the box that the music had been changed, but the show is so good that I didn't even notice, and couldn't stop watching. When I first saw ads on TV for Roswell, I thought it was going to be like a bad teenage version of X-Files (like a cross between X-Files and Dawson's Creek), but I was completely wrong. I can't wait for the other seasons to come out!!"
5,My thoughts on Roswell,I enjoyed Roswell Seasons 1 through 3. I think it deserves a 5 because of the fact those who have watched it know its a Good Show. It didint get a fair chance to air on the WB but It is in my opinion Completly Worth while.
3,How in the world could they do this!?!,Of all 3 season of the show the 1st was the only one I loved and truly cherished and could not wait to go to DVD so I could own and treasure it for all time. But the fact that they butchered it by taking out most of the original music really burns me. If I had known I would have thought twice or waited until it was a whole lot cheaper. It's just not the same!!!!!!!!!! The music set the tone for Shiri Appleby and Jason Behr to do their magic the music now takes away from the moment not adds to it! What in the world were they thinking were they even thinking! The only saving grace is Shiri Appleby commentaries otherwise so not worth the price! Argh!!!!
5,SOOOO EXCITED!!!,I was HOOKED on Rosewell from the first episode - and SOOO DEVISTATED that it only lasted 3 seasons! I'm VERY happy they're releasing this on DVD!!! I can't wait to get my copy - hope you'll buy it too so they'll bring out Season II and III!!........
2,Watch Roswell on the Sci Fi channel - don't buy this box set,"As many other people have noted the sound for the entire season was remastered to remove almost all of the original music and replace it with totally forgettable crapolla music that was produced just to fill the holes. The cost of creating the new music and remastering the sound for all 22 episodes must have been high, and unfortunately it absolutely trashes the show. If you were a fan of the show you will find it incredibly distracting. The new music at the beginning of ""Heat Wave"" sucks! Right now (7/05) Roswell is being shown on the Sci Fi channel with the original music. I suggest that you save your money and watch it there instead. You'll enjoy the show much more."
3,They Cut Corners At Our Expense,I enjoyed this show when it was on TV. The first season showing promise of what this show could be. I was thrilled when I finally was able to add this title to my DVD collection until I watched the DVDs and read the note enclosed stating that they took out many of the original songs played in the show and replaced them with lesser known songs. They also cut out scenes and offered very little in ways of extras. I was disapointed.If you can catch reruns on TV they still play the original episodes complete with original music and scenes. The only reason I give it 3 stars is that what they originally put out there for us to watch on TV was a good show.
2,"Ah, Yeah, Roswell","You know, I remember when this show debuted I thought:""The storyline seemed kinda interesting."" Although, I could never find anyone who was an avid watcher. That should've been a tip off right there. I found this show to be extremely boring. The first few episodes are a complete snoozefest. I was really expecting a lot more from the writers, actors, etc. It was as though someone said: Let's get a bunch of pretty people in a drab environment and see if we can make a hit show. I was really dissappointed with this one and grateful at the same time, 'cause I was on the verge of buying all three seasons at once. Thank GOD, I said lemme see how season 1 goes and take it from there. I will give the writers credit in one area, they did not take years to get to the bottom of the sheriff finding out whether those kids were what he thought they were. This show was just not for me. But prices and delivery from Amazon is always GREAT!!!"
4,roswell,from the 1st time I saw the show (pilot) I became hooked... I watched every episode of season 1... and can't wait to see season 2 & 3... It was a great show!
5,Even aliens go to high school!,"Despite my sister's vibrant reports, I made the error of dismissing Roswell as just ""another teen drama"", consequently only joining it midseason (in the UK). Fortunately my sister was more than happy to provide a passionate account of the fears and heartwarming ordeals of our heroes. Roswell uses a touch of alien magic to add the spice of adventure to a sweet tale of friendship and the real meaning of home. True to the palate of any Roswell alien!Season 2 adds an extra dash of Tabasco sauce and according to my Mum tastes even better."
2,Includes cutting edge songs selected by the original music team!,"And then,when you watch the whole thing,you realise the songs from the TV airing are still replaced.Don't they forgot to mention these cutting edge songs are NEW or am I just wrong fussing about it?!..."
5,Prayers Answered,"I am walking on air RIGHT NOW!!!! I never missed an episode of ROSWELL and it still stands as my favorite TV show. I have waited since its cancellation, for the show to be put on DVD. I'm sure all of us Roswell fans out there can breath a sigh of relief, our show will finally be on disk and we can now enjoy it whenever we want...."
3,i love roswell,"I love this dvd. i mean i waited so long for this dvd to come out. I love jason behr he acting is so good. My best part is when liz finds out max love her from the first time he saw her.THE DVD HAS GREAT SOUND AND PICTURE AND HAS SPECICAL FEATURES IN IT, THAT ARE EXTRA. I CAN'T WAITH UNTIL SEASIN 2 DVD TO COME OUT I HEARD IT'S COMING OUT IN SUMMER ( I CAN'T WAIT). SO WHAT I TRYING TO SAY IS BUY THE DVD. DON'T MISS OUT. SEE YA"
1,Just saw it this year,I was amazed at this show. They don't have stupid teenagers but real human beings [and aliens ]. I'm sure I didn't watch it because of the title.It is like watching old friends now. Got my sister hooked and several others. I don't believe I'll ever get tired of it. Just something so different about it. Something always happening and keeps your interest. I now own all the episodes. Just wish there were more. A movie about what they are doing now. Cross between the immortal and the fugitive. The Immortal starring C. George and the fugitive starring D. Jansen. What a great series!
4,Roswell very pleasant surprise for all.,"The Roswell series was a pleasant surprise for me from the first viewing on television, nothing has changed from watching it for the second time. Well acted, well written well presented, and full of surprises if you're a first time viewer. Not just for the young, I should know I'm nearly 60."
5,Finally! Roswell on DVD!,"I am so excited about getting my copy of Roswell on DVD. I was obsessed with this show during its short run on the WB, I was even fortunate enough to meet the cast! This show is a really good drama/comedy with just enough sci-fi flair. It has its cheesy moments, which only make it better. You won't be disappointed!"
2,Not Original Soundtrack,"I fell so deep in love with this show. i knew from the fisrt episode that was going on a great ride with a great drama, but i also fell deep in love with its music. when i ordered the DVD Boxset i had no idea that Fox changed every backdrop song and the music director replaced it with an entirely new soundtrack to every episode. I am disappointed muchly.I just wish i had the original soundtrack it brings back so many good memories."
4,Roswell - Season 1 GREAT but without the music,"Well, I can't say anything bad about the series because I like it so much, but as for the DVD set... well, like the producer says, I'd rather have the DVD set than the original music, however, in the second season DVD box, I will be very upset if in ""The End of the World"" the producer changes ""I Shall Believe"" by Sheryl Crow with something else.The DVD set is great and I like that each of the 6 DVDs comes with its own case. Can't wait for the rest of the series on DVD, especially season 3."
2,Disappointed and Confused,"Where is this gag reel they write about??? I knew I shouldn't expect much considering the fact that the show got short changed every chance it could. Season One Roswell was the best by far and I suppose I wanted to have it on discs...good quality instead of the countless videotapes I have.What they don't disclose is that they have changed the music in some scenes. I have only watched two episodes ""River Dog and ""Blood Brother"" so I don't know how much they have ruined the episodes. The originals worked, they should have left well enough alone. Unless they could not get the rights to the songs. Who knows.At any rate. You'd be better off just enjoying your video tapes, unless you don't mind spending $42 on something that has been tampered with."
3,One episode damaged,"This DVD set was fine, except one of the episodes does not play to completion. It just keeps playing in circles without completing the episode."
5,WOW,"I know that there were originbally things which were planned for this which didn't come about, but the final piece was still amazing! The interviews which were used in the area 51 extra were brilliant, you got to see alot of what the actors thought and felt about things, it wasn't just, 'I played Max in roswell, and i liked this episode....'. Bill Sadler was great, really funny, and Colin Hanks, with his thoughts on everyone was very enjoyable to watch. The episodes ae brilliant quality play - better than TV reception! and I would have bought it just for the extras it came with. Highly recommended!"
4,Extras? Different Music?,"I'll be disappointed if all the extras are not there...The music is one of the reasons that they said it'd never come out on dvd, too much to get the rights. I never considered they'd change it! If they aren't playing Sarah McLachlan during those key scenes in the first episode..."
1,"Don't be ""duped""","This is just another way for Fox to suck money from consumers. There is nothing new with these sets, but the package art. Katharine Heigl was not the star of Roswell as this new cover art makes it seem. I feel offense on behalf of the other actors on the show. This is just a way to sucker ""Grey's Anatomy"" fans into buying this.If Fox wanted to spend money on something, they should have shelled out the money to restore the original music to the show."
4,Roswell is like an abusive boyfriend,"At first it's wonderful, then it treats you horribly, but you can't leave it -- because it could change! The first season of Roswell, or more accurately, the first 16 episodes of Roswell, is some of the greatest young adult programming I've ever seen. Unfortunately many of the original writers bailed and were replaced by people who wanted to play up the sci-fi aspects of the series more than they wanted to make it a moving, realistic story of ""alienated"" teens. So I recommend this DVD to anyone who loved the series, but if you haven't seen it, I'm warning you -- you will fall in love with this show, get hooked, and then it will change horribly before your eyes. One word: Tess. Why, Katims, WHY??"
3,Fair presentation. Lousy Music,"The episodes look crisp and much better than most television shows on DVD. As on television, the quality of the show goes downhill with the episode ""Crazy,"" but the previous episodes are some of the best television I've seen in years. The one major problem with the discs is the music. Most of the songs have been replaced with generic pop sounding songs that add nothing. A shame."
4,Roswell isn't a snooze-well!,"I was a big fan of Dawson's Creek in the younger years. I was old enough to remember I had seen quite a few episodes or scenes of Roswell but young enough to only have flashes of them. After Dawson's ended, I looked for a show I could get attached to like that. Two or three weeks ago, I decided to buy the Roswell DVD. It was a lot of money and I hoped for the best. No Regrets.I watched the first DVD thinking the show was amazing. The second disc, to me, took a nosedive into 'okay' land but by three was great again. I'm only finishing up four by now so I can't really talk.The thing about Roswell is that you will fall in love with the characters. My personal favorites are Maria DeLuca, played by Majandra Delfino and Alex Whitman played by Colin Hanks.Go out and get this DVD. You will not be sorry. I hate SciFi and I love this."
4,Roswell Season 1 review,"Love this show. Its great. If you like x-files or smallville, you'll like this. Roswell alien teenagers trying to find out their origins."
2,Good series ruined by bad DVD release,"For some bizarre and inexplicable reason, the producers of the dvd went in and replaced the original score of this series. One of the highlights of this show was that it featured throughout each episode a soundtrack that represented the the time it was filmed...the original music is a part of the series in the same way the title song is a part of the show. To have gone in and altered one of the key ingredients in such a blatant way has done it a great injustice and frankly, it really ruined it for me."
2,Great Album - without the great vibes in this remaster,"What an incredible album, recorded and mixed at the legendary Hansa Studios in Berlin, where Bowie's Heroes was recorded. Oh, wait. This version was mixed recently, using pro-tools, without the wonderful ambience of Hansa... without Gareth Jones and Alan Wilder at the helm.Unfortunately, it shows.However, the extras are worth getting, and I dare say it's worth buying just for an A/B comparison with the original issue just to show how real acoustics beat out convoluted (their word, not mine) reverb algorithms EVERY TIME."
1,Disappointing,I was really disappointed by this book. It was more like a children's colouring book than anything else. The drawings were quite average and useless.
1,CROOKS!!,Zero stars. This seller (TVAC tools) has this item listed as a 3 pack. I received 1 item. I contacted the seller and the basically called me a liar until I sent them the link to their item. They refused to honor the 3 pack but instead told me to send back the item. They refused to pay my return shipping (which Amazon paid THANKS!). Crooks! They have this item on ebay for a buy it now price $5 cheaper!I did buy this product somewhere else and its AWESOME!!
5,Great little torch!,This is a wonderful little torch for basic jewelry applications as well as minor pipe-sweating jobs.
1,Don't buy this product from this seller ReStockIt,"This rating is NOT for the product. Is for the seller.This price is OUTRAGEOUS!!!! You can purchase this some other places for less than $100.Their price: $320.97 as of February 6, 2010."
1,not good,"This is not the ""normal"" buckwheat. This stuff is green. Its either not roasted enough or not ripe (?). Buckwheat kasha with milk is one of my favorite foods. I've enjoyed it since I was like 2 years old. These guys have no idea what they are selling. Probably haven't tried it either. DO NOT BUY!"
2,Weird taste bad smell,"If you are Russian and looking for good buckwheat kasha - don't buy that one, it's totally different thing. It smells like medicine and tastes weird, not like regular simple buckwheat. If you are the person who decided to try a buckwheat first time - don't buy that one, you will be disappointed and never know what a tasty meal it should be."
5,Blown away,"I've been in the manga scene for a while. And although there is nothing new or differant about Darkstalkers Volume 1, it is thoroughly enjoyable from begining to end.The artwork is very well done, the colours, consistency and style of the art just rocks. Plus all the characters are drawn very close to their original concepts.The story line of the comic is not exactly brilliant. It's rather straight forward, but that does not mean it's not entertaining. I don't know how true the story is to the actual video game as I unfortunetly never got to play Darkstalkers.I loved this graphic novel, and would not hesistate to recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading manga's that are beautifully drawn, beautifully executed and are filled with a beautiful lead female characters.I cannot wait for the next volume."
4,Good purchase,"I bought this to replace the cheapo cover that came with the table. It's heavy and well constructed and a big upgrade over the old one. It's on my 8 foot table, and it's not a 'perfect' fit for my table as some other reviewers noted, but it's a nice cover overall, fits pretty well and worth the purchase."
4,Opera Stars,Siepi has long been my favourite bass and Freni one of my favourite sopranos. There is a little irony in this performance insofar as Freni was married to rival bass Ghiaurov. Nonetheless this is a nice performance . Freni is her charming self and in good vocal form. Siepi sings some rather rare but non challenging arias but as he was in the latter stages of his career this is understandable. One can still sense the immense musicality and interpretive intelligence through all of this. Over all this is a worth while item for any opera fan's collection
1,DO NOT BUY this one,I have been waiting for this product for almost 3 months (it was supposed to have been shipped within 1 or 2 weeks)
5,Great Book!,"I bought it for my 2 year old and was thinking that we can start reading it by 3. But since I showed her this book, she wants to go through every single page daily. Now she knows all numbers up to 20 and all letters. This book is good to develop a wide vocabulary and start counting. Very nice images and easy games and puzzles. Now my daughter knows so many new words!! thank you so much for our favourite First Book:)"
1,Not properly advertised,"The product advertised and the product received were not the same. The workbook is the same title, but it is older and a different cover. It is advertised as having over 500 pages but it has under 100 pages. I feel ripped off."
3,Found it kind of boring for my 3 1/2 year old,"I got this to supplement our preschool home school curriculum. I rated it just okay because most of the pages are tracing of words that introduce the concepts instead of more active pages. My son LOVES the pages that have what he calls ""games"". For instance, draw a line to the picture that is opposite of the such and such picture. Those are great and help reinforce the concepts but he loathes the tracing of ""big"" and then ""small"". There is nothing to do on those pages but trace. Also, my son already knew his shapes and colors before we started the book, so that was a little repetitive for him. If you want to use this book for early handwriting skills, then it would be great. There is a lot of tracing and later in the book actually writing of letters and numbers. If you are just looking for some extra busy work, for the price, it isn't bad, but if you are looking for a solid preschool curriculum, I really don't find this that great."
5,Make Learning Fun!,"This book covers all the basics in a colorful, fun, yet no-nonsense way that does not waste either the home teacher's or student's time. I was very impressed with the worksheet format, as the pages are perforated and can be torn out and worked on. Using familiar Sesame Street characters is a big plus too. An answer key is also included, along with many helpful suggestions to the home teacher. This book will give value far exceeding its cost."
4,comprehensive curriculum,The book i received was not the one previewed but i do like the one we got.
3,looks better in the picture,"looks grander in the picture. looks like gawdy cut glass, no color, costume jewelry"
4,love the sparkle,"This ring sparkles and looks great. I can't afford the real thing, so this really works well for me!"
4,Excellent throughout but sparse on ending,"This is a well written book containing a personalized account of pre-revolutionary to post-revolutionary America. Randall does a good job of discussing the intellectual sources (e.g. John Locke) of Jefferson's essential documents (e.g. Declaration of Independence). Randall also is strong in his explication of Jefferson's private and diplomatic life in France. Interestingly, Randall shows both the personal and political events of Jefferson's lifetime.However, Randall is very sparse and fairly week in details after Thomas Jefferson returned from France and became Secretary of State. The author only devotes one fifty page chapter (in a 600 page book) on Jefferson's presidency. It seems as if the editor or author had a deadline to meet and therefore could not devote the same time and effort on the end of this book as was put on the begining."
4,"Though books on Thomas Jefferson, one of the first US Populists..(read rest of review for text)...","...could fill a library, there has long beena need for an authoritative, single-volumebiography that captures both the public andprivate man. This is THE volume to consult!The author, a fine historian and investigativejournalist, lays to rest many of the canardsthat have been bantied about for the lastseveral decades. He was almost an as influentiala Founding Father as George Washington and JamesMadison. This volume is especially good forhelping younger Americans understand the Col-onial period, when I country was young and onthe right path - that of the far-political middleand Populism. Forget the 'political-stupidity'being bantied about today - this book is the'real deal'."
2,A real let down in the end.,This book is good if you are interested in the events of Thomas Jefferson's life before he became Secretary of State. It is poor if you are interested in what happened while he served in the federal government. The first couple hundred pages are devoted to his law career in Virginia and the next couple hundred to his time in France. It is not until page 493 of 595 that the book gets to the year 1790 when he became Secretary of State. There is only 100 pages devoted to the last 36 years of his life. I kept expecting Mr. Randall to tie in the first years of his life to the events that helped shape this nation but in the end I just felt that Mr. Randall got tired of writing about him.
2,Thomas Jefferson: A Life (Paperback),"OUCH!This was a really tough read.I had to read paragraphs sometimes 2 or 3 times as the context was very bland.A lot of information to be sure, but its presentation is less than stellar.Of the first 8 presidents I have read, this book took a couple years off of my life.Not nearly enough about his presidency or his politics in general.I would recommend another book on Jefferson, although I couldn't tell you what one."
3,Too slow in parts - too fast in others,This book has some good points but for the most time they are too few and far between for me. It spends a lot of time in his early law career pointing out inch by inch his learning and growing career. Then when it gets to his presidency it moves too fast for my liking (as a presidential historian). On another note it did spend a good amount of time in his role as sec. of state and his role in the rise of political parties.
2,I felt like I needed to have prior knowledge of Jefferson.,"I was a little disappointed with this biography. I never really got used to Randall's writing style. I think he expected the reader to come to the book with substantial prior knowledge of Colonial American history. This was the first book on Jefferson that I have read, but I think it would probably be more informative to a person who has already read several Jefferson biographies."
3,Jefferson: Influences,"This book could have been better organized. The flow was circular and repetitious. Randall focuses too much on the things that influenced Jefferson, and not enough on his life. At every major (and sometimes minor) milestone in Jefferson's life, Randall takes us back to the passing of some law, or event that happened in the past that had an impact and explains it all in detail. It made it hard stay focused on the flow of time. The sections of the book that involved Jefferson's vacation were the most detailed and best to read. Jefferson's campaign for the 1800 election is given more attention than his time as part of the cabinet and as President. Randall improves over time -- I purchased Jefferson after reading ""Washington: A Life""."
5,A book that shows the soul of Jefferson.,The Angel HunterI found this book engrossing. I have always had high regard for Thomas Jefferson. I thought he was an inspired and inspiring man. Randell's excellent work confirms my deep rooted beliefs that Jefferson was a true leader and patriot in every sense of the word. Were are the Jeffersons for today?
5,"NIce, simple, accurate clock",Attractive wall clock simple to set: it sets itself! All you have to set is the time zone.Can't ask for more accurate time than one that links to the atom clock in CO.
5,Track Info On This Item,Tracklisting:A1 Everybody Move (Everybody's Club Mix) (8:10)A2 Everybody Move (Padapella) (4:59)B1 Everybody Move (Everybody's House Mix) (7:36)B2 Everybody Move (Everybody's House Music) (3:49)
5,Best EVER,We have had a set of these for more than 10 years and grill often. The set we have is so old we have tried replacing it with other tongs several times and each time return to our old grillpro. We have looked and looked for a new grillpro with no luck. We are happy to have found them again!
4,As advertised!!!,"The turner is smaller than I expected but then I bought it to be a one tool solution to hauling multiple grilling tools for my RV. Handles will probably hold up okay, for the price it is what is to be expected."
2,Grill Tong review,Trying to replace a pair of grill spatula tongs I had for years. This one is cheaply made and will not last. Awkward to use too.
5,Best tongs ever,I wore my old one out and had to have another! There isn't anything lacking at all with these tongs. Best ever.
2,Tried it once; we donated this item as it was not sturdy nor large enough for our grilling.,"Lightweight and the ""turners"" were undersized. We ordered this as a replacement for our previous tongs which were more than satisfactory. Definitely did not meet our expectations."
4,hard to find,Just what I was looking for!!Old flipper was broken and repaired! My husband MUST have this tool for burgers on the grill.
3,Big Hands Needed,"I have average size hands, and I found them to be useful for those with large hands. With hot dogs and bratwursts the tongs were no problem, but they became problematic with steaks and the like. While I like the length to keep you farther away from the grill's heat, I really had to stretch my fingers to get a decent grasp on big pieces of meat. It's a functioning product, but I feel bigger hands are needed."
2,Made in China - Need I say More?,The tongs are functional but cheaply made. But what do you expect for less than $5? When you add on $7.60 shipping - definitely not worth almost $12. Hope they last the summer.
2,Looks better than it is..,"It looked like a really good bag, until I got it. First off, it looks reddish on the website and it is actually a bright ORANGE. Secondly the corduroy is VERY stiff and the whole bag feels rough. Returning immediately."
1,For the dogs...,"This is a terrible book. It may have started with an amusing idea- coats of arms for breeds of dogs, but the designs are usually hackneyed, trite, or just plain bad. They are also repetitive, so half-way through the book, there's nothing left to see.Basically, it's boring for those who don't care about heraldry, and insulting to anyone who does."
2,Good for the first couple of reads,This book was interesting when I first read it. I had no idea that there was a coat of arms for every breed of dog. However after the first few times of reading it cover to cover I got bord with it. It really is more of a kids book. But as I said it is interesting only the first few times ( for adults) you read it. I would recommend checking it out of a library rather than buying it.
5,"description of ""Bar Sinister is totally wrong""","Whoever wrote the description on heraldry for canines about ""Bar Sinister"" is out in left field and probably knows absolutely Nothing about the charges, ordinaries, metals, etc. If he/she did the person would know that a bend is an honourable ordinary and the bend sinister is the same thing and does not represent a ""bastard"". That person should know that a regular bend with a baton on the bend is the actual meaning of one of illegitimate birth. How do I know. I've studied the subject for over 25 years. I personally think it is an act of stupidity to put something down like a ""bar sinister"" as there is no such derivation in any research volume on heraldry.Bill Wendeborn"
1,The Proud and the Dammed,"If there was a ZERO to pick from above, that would be to kind for this movie! I only bought it because I am a Chuck Connors fan and he was killed half way through the movie. It was one of the worst movies I now have in my collection. To bad I couldn't have rented it first to watch, but I think the rental places are way to smart to do that!!!! The quality is horrible and the acting from EVERYONE is the worst ever!!! Do not buy this movie!!!"
2,OVER TO FAST,The workout was alright not what everybody raved about. It seemed you just get warmed up and it is time to cool down. Video is not a 32 minute workout more like 20 minutes. Unless you like rewinding to repeat not worth money.
5,Excellent book,This is a great book written from prison...anyone who comments on anything but the book neither has the judgement nor credibility to review this book....ignore the liberals who comment!!!!
2,slow,"Too much beating around the bush here. Good concepts, but I thimk it was written in the old days, Some good info on dealing with mixed kids."
4,Excellent Book,"A must read for all couples planning to get married. There are topics in here that you should definately bring up to your ""intended"" BEFORE you say ""I do""."
1,Not worth even the $10,"Does not heat well enough to curl lashes; connection is bad so you may think you need a new battery, but you don't. I previously had the Emjoi which disintegrated and it was a much better product; however, Amazon no longer sells it."
1,Eyelash curler,"When I received the heated eyelash curler, the curler tip was broken and the handle was dirty (sticky glue). I guess you get what you pay for. I usually don't order items online because I prefer to look at items carefully before buying them. I don't like the hassles of returning items (pay postage to return, drive to the post office and wait for another one). I am disappointed and might not buy anything online again."
3,short and can be hard to use,"this product was bought for my bearded dragon. It can be difficult to get him into it. the tightening mechanism also worries me. I'm always afraid it is too tight on him, but if i put it where the proper tightness should be when comparing to to a dog or a cat collar, he would slip right out. but he moves easily in it, he doesn't seem to mind it once he is in it. the leash is also pretty short. the clip at the end is plastic and could easily break. this design would work better for a larger lizard."
3,Impossible.,"Getting the leash onto my Tegu is virtually impossible. Though when it's on, it works great. Have fun trying to get your lizard used to this."
4,"""EMI""",Good product but you must remember that your Reptile is not a dog they do not like being carried around like a dog.Other than that if you just want to take your lizard outside to Bask great product.
3,The Water Here's too Shallow,"In his second Archer tale, Macdonald attempts to explore family psychology, but the result for me was disappointing. The characters remained pretty surface, with the ending not being all that plausible. The treatment of the homosexual characters is fairly risible by today's standards, though Macdonald in this respect, as in others, was merely following the example of the Master, Chandler. There is some good writing, however. Still, overall I'm surprised this one often is singled out as his best."
5,Truly a mystery classic (but don't let that scare you),"I hesitate to call this a classic because some people consider ""classics"" as dull and out-dated. And there's nothing dull or out-dated here (well, maybe that paying $10 to be driven from Las Vegas to L. A. is a bit out of date).Archer's hired to discover who sent his client's husband a letter accusing her of infidelity. Introduced to the family and friends at a party as a Hollywood agent, he is sensitive to the growing tension and explosive atmosphere. The reader knows of course that somebody's going to be murdered, but these early chapters are among the most skillfully written to build suspense that I've ever read.Written in 1950, the inclusion of a homosexual couple was quite daring although there is not graphic description, and isn't significant enough a factor of the plot to either offend or attract a reader.Read this and I'm sure you'll find it on your own list of crime classics."
4,One of the best fifties LA noir,"I'm not a big fan of detective series because they tend to become robotic in plot and characterization, but the Ross MacDonald/Lew Archer series is an exception. Crisp language, tight plots, and geat dialog make for a gripping story.A sad sidenote. Don't rent/watch the insipid Paul Newman/Joanne Woodward movie 'loosely' based on the book. Instead of LA they set it in New Orleans and they basically rearranged all the characters into pale versions of their literary counterparts. Just thought I'd let you know."
4,Good training manual for Special Ops.,"As a veteran myself, it reminds me of what we ask young kids to do and they do it well."
3,Charlie Rangers,"I was a little less than thrilled with the accuracy of the book. There are omissions from the roster and there are some photographs that seemed to be from Lima Company, rather than from Charlie Company. For a factual book, this has a tendency to taint history with inaccuracies.However to be fair to the writers, I have been told that it was the decision of the publisher to not make corrections, once notified."
3,Iffy,"This book is interesting enough, and a page-turner, but I thought it read more like a silly movie that glorifies war rather than a serious memoir. Although I know these men were there, and it provides some real insight into what they went through and the bond between the men there, it really did not stand out to me as a very good book."
1,Disturbing,"If you enjoy leering, joking depictions of a female corpses being stripped naked by one of the co-authors, then this book's for you.Personally, I felt like I'd gotten the glimse into a mind that was somewhat like turning over a rock and seeing a multitude of bugs crawling around."
2,An o.k movie,It was an o.k. movie not one of my favorites.I have seen many of his movies that have been a lot better.
3,Great Quality!,"I haven't used this yet, but I wanted you to know that for the price this has great quality!!!!Denille"
1,printer cartridge,I thought the printer cartridge I had ordered was new. I pic showed the carton a new cartridge comes in. I received it in a black plastic bag.
4,Good Value,Product was as expected. Original box was pretty beat up but so far no issues with the cartridge. Good price for this item - will use this vendor again unless there are any issues later.
4,Deviant Behavior,"This book gives a very intriguing and exciting look into the world of deviance, for instance what makes a murder a murder or a raper a raper. Good examples, backgrounds, and references. This book will make the endeaver to lecture this course so fun."
1,This book is a disgrace to academia,"This book is a disgrace to academia. The author has yet to master the art of forming a coherent thought or sentence. He routinely writes in the vernacular, rather than a formal researcher's form. Topics are generally discussed by listing a heading, then inserting some ramblings which are devoid of proper paragraph structure and citations. Once you get past the dire lack of high school level composition skills, you find an author bent on slanting his readers toward his own views, which, unsurprisingly, are quite socialist. Rather than begin with premises and present supporting arguments and research, he automatically assumes his own slanted view is correct. I find it hard to believe this book is published and used in classrooms, but I suppose the socialists have to make up for a lack of logical thought with print volume."
5,Great for College Students,"Students that are enrolled in a Deviant Behavior class for Sociology, this is the book you need. If your professor actually uses and teaches directly from the book you better order this now."
2,Required text for a course,"I don't actually believe in sociology and I think Mr. Thio's reasoning is mushy at many points. If you're thinking of paying full-price at your campus bookstore for the current edition, think again. The author mainly updates the pictures each year and tosses in a few new references - if you buy a coffee for the guy next to you he'll probably let you skim his new addition before the exam."
1,Biased,This book is chalk full of biases and fallacies - especially regarding gun ownership.The way the book is written in general is enough to give you nightmares. I don't need to hear over and over that men rape women and all of the various ways. And I don't care to sample every version of suicide on an instance by instance case.The composition of this book is much like a crappy website made to rant - it's a jumble of confused thought.
4,Well Worth the Read,"This was a daring approach that could have fallen flat on its face. However, the author pulls off the task of writing from three peoples perspectives well, especially considereing that two of those people are widely read authors themselves. The pain and frustration inherent in the Doctor at the end are palpable and really topped off a very good book."
2,Unreliable. Cryptic user interface,"My experience with this product:* User interface is not intuitive. Each time the battery ran down, the manual had to be studied to determine how to reset the product, which loses all memory of previous user preferences when batteries were changed.* One of the side buttons completely failed, so I had to take the unit apart and manually ""short"" one of the switches to operate it.* It frequently failed to detected the atomic clock wireless signal.* The wireless connection to the separate temp sensor eventually failed completely.When it worked, the form factor was very nice (low profile, reasonably easy to read)."
1,rip off,Description says (pack of 6) pack of 2 with a price of $30 ... since these sell for $5-6 for a pack of 2 it sounded right that 6 two-packs or 2 six-packs would be $30 .... WELL what you get is ONE pack of two ... rip-off bigtime!!!
4,great book!,"This book is much better than the current older text I have on herbal remedies, however it is also lacking in some regards."
2,Style Match for Pregnancy,"My wife is in her twelfth week of pregnancy and this book was read but not used as a reference for her pregnancy. We tried to figure this out since it got some outstanding reviews. I concluded the style (breezy) appeals to certain people and the reason for the good reviews. We ended up using The Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy as the cover to cover and everyday reference book for her pregnancy. The Mayo was a power pack book of information that was organized exceptionally. If you like a breezy, casual girlfriend chatty type book then the ""Mother"" book is for you. Otherwise stick to the Mayo."
3,"Good info, but not the best...","This has been a decent resource, but not my favorite of the two books I have been reading. I am 21 weeks along in my first pregnancy and I bought this book when I became pregnant. The first 130 pages or so are about trying to conceive, which is great for those looking for that info. For me it didn't apply. Also, this book does NOT have a break down of the developmental stages and what goes on during the pregnancy. It discusses what you will want to do to during your pregnancy, concerns you might have, complications that can arise, prenatal testing, and giving birth. All great info but I also wanted to know what was going on with my growing baby and my body. I recommend this book along with ""Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy"" from the Mayo Clinic, that has been my go to book. Between these two books, I have a lot of great info which has been a big help."
2,Bleh...,"This book didn't do much for me. I highly recommend The Mayo Clinic guide instead. This book is a bit disorganized and has too many stories from mothers, which I didn't really like. I wanted straight up facts, non-biased. I read half of it and stopped reading it...."
4,"Solid, not the best out there","This is a great book, but I found the Mayo Clinic Pregnancy book to be much more informative and better organized."
4,"Good resource, especially when you are trying to conceive","I bought this book and the Mayo Clinics baby book. I used this book the most when we were trying to conceive. It is a great resource book to look up specific things. However, once I was pregnant, I used the May Clinic book more because it has information for each week/month. I only use this book now if I want extra info on a certain topic, but read the Mayo Clinic book every week. If I had to pick from the two, I would go for the May Clinic book. But this is a good resource, and I did buy it for my sister-in-law who is trying to conceive."
4,Informative,This book is very informative. It has good material and answers quite a few questions. It would be nice if it had a more detailed section about the progression of your pregnancy though. But overall a good read.
4,Good overall view,"For someone that has not read any of this kind of book before I found this a very good overview. It has more than 2 pages on pre pregnancy, which was what I was interested in. Not too heavy, possibly could have gone into more detail in some areas."
2,a wierd combination of flippant and terrifying,"I thought this book had some good information (better available elsewhere) but was really flippant about breastfeeding and really scary in its use of statistics. It isn't incredibly well organized, and it has as has been mentioned, lots of typos. I wanted it to be better than it is!"
5,The Pregnancy Book,"I find the book very well-written and easy to read, which is very important for pregnant women which in their actual condition cannot focus on very complicated words and facts."
2,don't bother,"This book looks like it would be a good one but definatly not worth it. It does have some good info about pre conception care and some good info here and there but other wise it basically tells you that your awful if you don't choose to do a homebirth with a mid wife without drugs and if you have a boy you shouldn't get them circumsized. i thought this would help me make choices but instead she pushes only her views and definatly isn't non- biased. I would recommend getting ""what to expect when you expecting"" definatly alot more info on every option and with and non biased view they give you the information and then you can make your own choice it also goes week by week to let you know whats going on in your body!"
3,Water Damage,"I received this book with quite a bit of water damage. The books is bent from it, and some of the pages are discolored. It's still legible, but not exactly what I expected. As far as the book, I haven't read all of it yet, but the information is pretty helpful."
5,Impressive,"As an RN and a hopefully soon-to-be Mom I was looking for an all-inclusive book on pregnancy that wouldn't talk down to me or be over my head. I think this book does just that. ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" claims much and I think gives too much. Even as an RN I thought that book was over my head and not organized well, where as ""The Mother of All Pregnancy Books"" gave great information. It has an awesome section on pre-pregnancy which I think is becoming more and more important as people try to plan the timing of their pregnancies more. I would recommend this book over ""What to Expect..."" any day."
1,Disappointed,"Had read all the reviews - and was expecting something far better than it turned out to be. I will say it touches on a lot of subjects - but that's all it does is ""touch"" on them! There's no more information here than you can find on most pregnancy web sites for free - and it doesn't go into enough detail to offer much help. It's a good book if you don't know anything about pregnancy and want to learn a little bit about a lot of different aspects. But it's not a good book if you are seeking substantial information or meaningful answers to your questions. I think the author just tried to put too much in one book and as a result gave too little on every subject. Think twice about this one - or buy it only if you want simple, basic information."
2,What A Bummer!,"This book was a quick read. I flew through it in less than a week's time. Yet, by the end, I felt miserable! I put the book down with the impression that pregnancy is every worst ailment I've ever had all rolled into 9 months. There is much to be paranoid about after reading about all the problems, issues and things that can go wrong. I've read similar reviews about the classic ""What To Expect When You're Expecting"" -- that it's a Debbie Downer of a book. I suspect I'll refer to this book as needed and glean a couple facts from it, but overall, it's not what I expected. Instead, I recommend something like ""The Mayo Clinic Book"" about pregnancy (for reliable reference and symptom-checking, without scaring you) and ""Brain Rules For Baby"" (for a positive, enjoyable read with lots of scientific studies cited.)"
2,I prefer the What to Expect Series,I was very disappointed by this book. It contains the same information that every other pregnancy book has but the way it's organized is very annoying. All of the pull outs and blurps scattered in the text are distracting from the content and I found the chapters didn't flow with my pregnancy. I was very excited about getting this book because of all the posative reviews and I didn't bother to buy the What to Expect series because so many people thought this was better. Thankfully a friend gave me a copy of What to Expect which I found informative and easier to read.
2,It's not the Mother!,"I just bought this book amongst others and it is average, not ""the mother"". Ironically, the book I was most hesitant to buy ""What to expect when your expecting"" had more information about DHA, supplements, etc. than this one did."
3,Good book but charts are annoying...,"I bought this book on the recommendations of the reviews at Amazon. I agree it is a good book that covers many topics, but I don't like the layout. So much of the book is charts that require you to turn the book, so it doesn't make very good in-bed reading, or in public places. I kept feeling like I was looking at the centerfold of a magazine! I think they could have presented the information within the chapter, and not with a chart. This is more of a reference book than one you can read from beginning to end."
4,Very Informative!,"This is a great book for 1st time moms. It is very informative & realistic & did not leaving me worrying about tons of ""what ifs"". It does give the top 10 worries for each trimester, but is not so overwhelming as some books. This was a good purchase & I would recommend it to any mom-to-be."
1,Mother of All Pregnancy Books,"I am a health professional and I do not recommend this book unless you just want a brief summary of the major topics listed in the title. You'll have to buy other books to supplement the knowledge you're really seeking. It does not go ""in depth"" on anything except the explanation of some prenatal testing in some charts. Some of the info is even incorrect: for example, in the ""nutrition"" section, the sources it lists as the best oils to eat to get essential fatty acids in your diet is inaccurate (the best source is flax seeds, sunflower/pumpkin seeds). The best books I found for pregnancy were at my local half-price books store, at least here I was able to flip through and read the books to make sure they were worth while. The books I bought there were over five years old but had excellent info."
5,good book,I couldn't put it down. I was reading this from the point of view of wanting to become pregnant. I think this book was very helpful and would recommend it. The only concern I had was the statistics were from 1999.
5,My morning sickness survival guide,"As other reviewers have noted, The Mother of All Pregnancy Books is a really comprehensive book. The author knows what types of issues you're dealing with and what kind of information you're looking for at various points in your pregnancy and she consistently delivers the goods. The section on morning sickness is a classic example. The author concisely summarizes all the latest research about the causes and treatment of morning sickness and then tells you all kinds of practical things you can do to try in order to ward off some of the queasiness. I have really found this book to be practical, helpful, and above all reassuring."
2,Some good information between all the sarcasm,"As a first time mother, I was looking for a book that would answer my seemingly endless list of questions. While this book does provide some good information, it is hard to decipher the facts from the sarcastic comments and attempts at wit. Every section and statement is worded in what I assume the author saw as a clever way, but after trying 5 or 6 topics, I gave up trying to get any useful information. If you're like me and are looking for a more straight-forward, well-researched book, try Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis. It is by far the best organized and most clearly worded pregnancy book I have read - having tried The Pregnancy Bible, What to Expect (too cynical and scary), as well as The Mother of all Pregnancy Books."
3,just good,"I got this based on the reviews, expecting something really awesome. I honestly just found it OK. It seems extremely basic, which can be good for an overview type of book, but I thought it would be much better. I wish I had flipped through it at the bookstore before deciding to purchase it. One of the things I like about it, opposed to many other pregnancy books, is that it has a little section on pre-conception, which is what I was looking for. It talks about some things you can do to prepare before getting pregnant, but it doesn't go into as much detail as I was hoping. I will keep it to have on hand, but would definitely not consider it ""the best pregnancy book."""
3,"Nice, Not ""the Ultimate Guide""","Look, this is a nice book, with a lot of interesting information. One thing I really like about it is the charts - well organized. However, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"", which I was trying to get away from, actually gives a better month-by-month description of what's going on during pregnancy.So if you're looking for a supplemental book for your pregnancy library, go ahead and get this book. If you're looking for the one and only book you'll need for 9 months, this isn't it - sorry."
2,Not very useful,I did not find this book helpful or very interesting to read. I suggest What to Expect When You're Expecting.
1,Keep searching for a better book,"I purchased this book along with a few others and this is the only book that I am disappointed I purchased. I would highly recommend completely passing on this book and getting a more informative book like ""What to Expect When Your Expecting"" and or the informative and light hearted ""Pregnancy Countdown"" book. Over all this book is a total waste of your time - pass on this book and take a nap instead."
2,Baby book,"This book was okay. It of course is a ""pregnancy"" book. It touched on several subjects, but alot of the information I was already aware of. This book is okay if you have NO clue about pregnancy or how to prepare for it. It does however have an excellent section on multiple pregnancy or abnormal pregnancy, but that doesn't apply to the average mom-to-be. My husband wanted to read the book with me, but he didn't like it. It was about the yucky parts of pregnancy that he didn't want to know. Husbands need a book about after baby gets here and how their lives will change. That is what a man needs to know."
1,Glaring Error,"For all the experts enlisted for technical review and such, shame on Ann Douglas for not catching an obvious error on pps 86-87: the cervix is NOT high during the beginning of the menstrual cycle.Incorrect information is bad but to place it in context of pregnancy achievement is blatently irresponsible.After catching this error, the book left a bad taste in my mouth.There are much better books on pregnancy than this one..."
5,Excellent start to your baby reading material,"This is the first book i've read on pregnancy, and i'm sure it will not be the last in this vast see of pregnancy books. It is so well layed out in terms of easy to read information, with charts on symptoms, problems that can go wrong and other info. The author writes as if she's sitting down at your kitchen table chewing the fat, in a simple and non alarmist way about the joys and dangers that can occur with births. Excellent resource!"
2,Who deleted my negative review?,"This is my second posted review of this book. Somehow authors or interested parties are able to delete negative reviews, depriving the consumer of information.This book covers the basics, but sorely lacks in medical and nutritional knowledge. The author is a midwife, not a OB doctor."
4,Very informative but not overwhelming,This is a good beginners book! I have since read more in depth (and boring) books but had a better understanding because of the great intro to all things pregnancy from this one. Get this one first!!
5,Storks-R-Us...We deliver!,"I am not a natural when it comes to babies. Until recently I happily thought babies where still delivered by Storks-R-Us. When my husband seriously started talking babies I seriously started looking for some help. I found it in this book. It was perfect for me. The information is serious yet written in a fun and easy to read way that didn't scare me off when I found out where babies really come from! After reading this twice and 'The Mother of All Babies Books' I gave my husband my birth control pills last night. Hopefully we will be delivering soon, too!"
5,loving this book,I am still trying to concieve and I have been reading the first few chapters of this book over and over! There is just so much information! Now I know how my body actually works to have a baby! I've been charting my temperature which I find exciting :) I can't wait to get that possitive test back and delve into the rest of the book!
3,"Lots of info, but not in depth","This was the first pregnancy book I bought. I thought it had a lot of info, but was not what I was looking for. I will keep it around as a quick reference..."
4,Answers all your first-time questions,"... and some you didn't even know you had. The information in the book is very comprehensive. I'm at the beginning of my first pregnancy, and for a person that used to be relatively worry-free, I've found myself worrying a lot about my activities and so on and how that affects the baby. Douglas gave a lot of detailed, sensible answers to almost any question that I could think of, and when there was some discrepancy between women / care providers on an issue, it was noted, and I appreciated that (i.e. it laid out the facts, rather than preached on what a person should or shouldn't do in those circumstances).The only drawback, and this I can't completely see as a fault, is that the book was SO complete that I ended up worrying MORE about things that I never even dreamed would be an issue."
4,Handy reference,"This is an excellent resource which answers the many questions you have. Since it is based on interviews with real woman the questions are about the real things that we worry about. Very user-friendly, fascinating facts, and easy to read. Great to flip through to find out the things you didn't even know you had questions about! I'd also recommend The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night - it addresses the number one issue you'll face during those early months and contains an excellent chapter on newborns."
2,"OK for expecting mothers, but not wonderful","I bought this book, along with What to Expect When You're Expecting and I definitely prefer the latter of the two. The Mother of All..was not put together in a month by month format, which I've found rather annoying now that I'm pregnant. It also has the author's ""humorous"" insights, most of which are cute and unnecessary. It was good reading prior to my pregnancy, but now that I'm 5 months along, I've found it difficult to pinpoint the information I'm looking for unless I turn to the index. I would recommend it for the ""trying to conceive"" chapters, which explain temperature charting and provide a chart which you can increase in size and make multiple copies of. I found that I was referring to the book a lot before I was pregnant, but now that I am, I turn to other books which are more reader friendly."
4,TMI!,"This book is VERY informative. Unfortunately, a great deal of the information deals with ""high risk"" pregnancies and also includes all the things that could possibly go wrong with your pregnancy. It's always good to be informed of such things, but the reader should be prepared to feel a bit saddened, overwhelmed, and terrified but these parts. Just because it's right there in black and white, it doesn't mean it's going to happen to you."
5,Outstanding advice,I have to agree that this is an outstanding book that outlines the principles needed to master your financial life. Definitely 5 stars. This book is especially relevant to those starting in business. Get the book.
5,AWESOME,This is the best book I have ever read on on how to take control of your Cashflow and enjoy Financail Freedom. I recommend you buy it and start applying the principles.
5,Powerful Stuff!! Dare You To Implement It And Stick To IT!,This book is great. I will read it over and over for the rest of my life. Its entertaining and yet dense enough to be used as reference material well after you finish it. Amazingly organized. The subject matter progresses just as it should and the real life examples really bring the lessons to life. Empower yourself and think about your future and that of your children. Plan and never be in want. Not a strain to implement. Good for any situation. Go!!! That you folks at Money Mastery!!! I am now aware.
5,An extremely solid workout for everyone.,"I have to admit, this video can actually compare to Billy Blank's TaeBo. Although I am a diehard TaeBo fanatic, I think that this video is an excellent edition to my Cardio Kickboxing/Boxing collection. Like Billy, Silk has the charm and charisma needed to make one comfortable with the validity of the workout presented. Although this video has an intro and beginners workout, the workout is somewhat intense and WILL give you results. Don't just take MY word for it, check it out for yourself.............well, go on. :)"
4,Excellent workout;Silk is even better than Billy (Blanks),"I must admit I was a little concerned when I first bought this video that it was going to be just another ""Tae Bo"" video, was I ever mistaken. This is more for those who want to learn the actual Art of Kickboxing yet still want an ""aerobic-type"" video. Silk Manning is an excellent instructor. He explains the moves very well and demonstrates just as thoroughly. He demonstrates each move in the beginning and doesn't ""throw"" in any anything that he hasn't already shown you in the instructional. I haven't touched my Tae Bo videos since I purchased this one."
3,"Really good, but not long enough!","The beginning is very attractive, so are the story events, but there isn't much of the real action that makes a (Star Wars) interesting. There is also the absence of a long story line, the thing which makes me angry!For true Star Wars fans, I suggest having this one."
3,Welcome to Munchkinland,"I bought the GoType keyboard hoping to use it to take notes during meetings and classes, but I've discovered that it's just too darn small for my hands.Although it feels well built, the keyboard is sluggish and will sometimes miss a stroke here and there if you're a particularly fast typist, regardless of where you set the key repeat rate. I've never had this problem on my wife's Stowaway or on my laptop; I move at a pretty good clip across the keys and I want any mistakes I make to be my own, not my equipment's.In spite of my initial impression (""yeah, I can use this"") I also discovered that after about a half hour on the GoType my hands and wrists begin to ache due to the unnatural typing position that it forces you into.If you've got larger-than-average hands, or are a 60+ WPM typist, I'd avoid the GoType and try the Stowaway, which is larger to use but smaller to carry, and much more user-friendly."
2,Beam receive MUST be on?!,"I will start this rant off by saying that I only received the product last evening, so I haven't had much time to evaluate the keyboard -- BUT, I must say this now, because I hadn't seen anyone mention this before. Apparently, you must have 'Beam Receive' ON for the keyboard to work.. (Which uses more battery) ..also, you HAVE to make sure the visor is off, before you dock it into the keyboard, or else the keyboard doesn't work. This is a bit annoying. Otherwise, it is a decent looking keyboard. The included software is a nice bonus.."
5,An Extemporaneous Work Of Art!,"I cannot speak well enough about the author or his book! Dr. Fortunato has combined both brilliance and enthusiasm into his book, The Ultimate Assist. If anyone has ever been interested in topics ranging anywhere from the NBA to the mass media, this is no doubt the ideal text to own. Dr. Fortunato currently has a Ph.D. in Communication from Rutgers University, and an M.A. in Communication and B.A. from William Paterson University, and has successfully created a fascinating non-fiction work that depicts the NBA as it is today; the Ultimate Assist is a definite page-turner. With fascinating interviews, unlimited knowledge, and the greatest passion, The Ultimate Assist is no doubt a book that everyone should own a copy of."
5,smooth read,I found the Ultimate Assist to be very insightfull. Fortunato presents the facts in a very smooth enjoyable way. An excellent read for any N.B.A. fan
2,Not funny,All of the material was from Winters' earliest years. Very dated and just not humorous. Video quality was extremely poor. My husband fell asleep twice watching it.
1,Worthless -- only 700 terms!!,what kind of dictionary is this? This must have taken them a week to create. I ended up buying another financial dictionary that I'm much happier with.
5,"Wilson's best, bar none","A group of archaeologists, racing against time to unearth an Indian burial mound before it is immersed in a man-made lake, discover instead the secrets they've buried in their own hearts. As enamored as I am of Wilson's entire oeuvre, this is the piece I consider to be his masterwork. I've worked on his plays as both an actor and a director, and the more you dig, the more they open up -- bottomless wells of depth and perception. THE MOUND BUILDERS is possibly the most exquisite play to be written in the last quarter of the twentieth century. It's thrilling, complex and deeply human, utterly mysterious and achingly sad."
5,Another great book,"I highly recommend any of the Sesame Beginnings board books. My son has loved all of them, they are very colorful with cute rhymes."
5,Best portal book,Best book for learning WebSphere portal (and I have them all). The redbook is also useful but this book is the first one you should read.
1,Get a free IBM redbook,"Is one of worst books I've ever read. Save your money and get the WebSphere redbooks from the IBM website. This book is not even finished, a lot of stuff is left half explained or not explained at all. Either the authors don't know what they talk about or they were just in a rush to put this book on the market."
5,802.11 B from Compaq,"This card is outstanding, not just because it runs like a champ but because the software that comes with it actually gives you reasonable feedback.Also, if you are finding the access point too pricey (it is really excellent), I would try a company called: buffalotech.com. They make a really neet home wireless kit that is 802.11 compliant. Very cheap and available now. Or, you can wait for Compaq's cool looking home access point. Should be available at Radioshack in the next month or so.When you use this thing with a wireless access point, the iPaq Pocket PC and MS Exchange, email takes on a whole new realm. The bandwidth is really there. The Palm just cannot do this and logging into a 19.2 connection and running through yet another ISP is not an option for me."
4,Stable and Seamless! The only Compaq Deive I own.,"Well, actually, I won 2 Compaq products. After buying a Compaq laptop 4 years ago and having nothing but problems with it and their support, I swore never to buy anything form them again.However, I picked up a used compaq wifi card as a test on our wireless network @ work (Cisco 350 Series Access Points) and it worked wonderfully. The software install was a little tricky (getting the correct version etc.), but once up and running it is so reliable that I can't complain.So then what? Well, I thought I would install it on my Pockey PC 2002 iPaq. Again, awesome stability. I can now take my handheld to Starbucks and get on their wireless network there and check email while having my morning (well, afternoon and evening) coffee.It isn't as good as the Cisco cards I have tested, but it is one of the best cards I find that is closest to ""true wired speed"" then most I have used (linksys, xircom).Hope this helps...email me if you have any questions.Kevin"
4,Any cheaper alternatives for a home wireless LAN,"Can anyone recommend a cheaper alternative for a home wireless LAN? The NICs (PCMCIA, PIC, etc.) are reasonably priced but the cost of the base unit is too high for the very low volume of devices that I want to use (ie., 2-3).Note that I need suppported products for NT v4.0 and Windows2000.Peter"
5,Features,it is stylish and makes my little white dog look alot more manly and still fluffly and cute. It is the peect size for a little dog!
1,Don't waste your money..,Like the LATE YEARS ..this DVD is basically a strung together bunch of movie trailers from the films Duke released during these years....and poor quality trailers at that...avoid unless you are a completist collector.
3,"""What do you by HOW MUCH IS THAT DOGGIE IN THE WINDOW ?""","terrariumthemovie.comStarring: Timothy S. DaleyWritten and Directed by : Mike ConwayOkay this film freaked me out.I have claustrophobia and a fear of the dark...The monster was done well,The creepy keepers were well thought out.I saw the extras ,And like everyone else who ever desired owning the Batmobile or Oscar Meyer Weiner wagon ...I wanted that ship and TO FIND OUT it was destroyed makes this fan-boy cry !The set was something, really something and done to its best angles, Can't imagine what place those actors went to bring the fear that is so apparent.Mike Conway has lots more movies up his sleeve and we cant wait."
1,Trash,"I am sorry to say that I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this ""film"". The story does no make any sense, the special effects are laughable and the script/acting crude. Please, do not waste your time!"
2,"yikes, I really should read these reviews Before going to BB","Other reviews are pretty much right on, it's dramatically ..asinine. But funny, so there is one redeeming factor -that's why the extra star.DON'T BUY, Rent for a laugh (you might enjoy if you take lightly)"
2,Wardian case in space,"Original film name is more appropriate ""Terrarium"" (2003). (Filmed in Las Vegas and surrounding area) watch and you will see why.A new planet has been found and looks like it can be colonized. We get the standard mix of colonizers and their backgrounds.Their spaceship has a mishap and the potential colonizers wake up (thaw out) 15 years later to find themselves stuck in their cryo-thingies. But wake they are not alone. Looks like they may be alien munchies. But wait it gets weirder. However I am not about to give the story away. Per-say the original title may give you a clue.Do not let tales of low budget discourage you and think of the presentation as more of a play."
1,RUUUUUNNNNNN!,"Hey, I like bad SF movies. I love bad SF movies. This is not a bad SF movie. This is the worst piece of schlock that I have EVER seen in my life! The worst acting, the worst plot, the worst sets (they spent $24K? Where?), the worst dialog. Period. I have seen better computer FX at the local high school. Avoid. At all costs. Not even worth MST3K'ing!"
1,The worst movie I ever watched in USA,The worst movie I ever watched in USA. It can't get worse than this.
1,"Plan 9 From Outer Space, again","The most artless attempt imaginable. It makes Ed Wood look like a film god..............and sadly, I may need to watch it again."
2,Interesting And Disappointing,"When I received this book I was really eager to read it. The whole storyline appealed to me and I was convinced, based on the first few chapters, that I would enjoy it. I'm not sure when I changed my mind. Maybe it was after reading countless details about historical and political China when I just wanted to know more about the main characters. Sometimes I felt as if the author couldn't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story. While her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative, the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side. I found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts. Also, the ending (which I won't give away) sort of left me feeling cheated. I suppose I could've overlooked all of those things except for one thing. The fact is, the main character just isn't very interesting or likeable. To me, that's a deal-breaker."
4,my review`,"I really loved this book. The story is about two people who meet, fall in love, marry and then suffer the consequences for their love, for they are of different cultures. She is from America and he is Chinese.The story englobes the problems in China at the start of the Revolution and how this couple try to adapt to their surroundings.The characters are very well described and you feel an immediate bond to their struggles. You can really fell their determination, but also their pain at all they have to go through.Very good book and also a good source of information."
2,Great beginning...,"The first half of the book was quite exciting, detailing how a teacher who is fascinated by a particular Chinese student becomes permanently attached to him when he is her savior in the big San Francisco earthquake. Their early trials & tribulations are interesting, but after the familiy's move to China the story centers more around politics than personalities and I lost interest."
3,Didn't Love It,"I ordered this book because I'm in a interacial relationship and was curious about how difficult it was for interacial couples in the past.What I didn't like about the book is I felt the relationship between Paul and Hope wasn't strong enough from the beginning. I felt absolutely no chemistry between them. To me, their relationship seemed contrived. Perhaps, this is because neither character seemed very appealing to me. I couldn't see what either of them saw in each other. I personally think the novel would have worked better if the author built up the relationship in the beginning...added more tension and more romance.Actually, I think I liked the minor character's better...Lin, Sarah, Mulan, the mother-in-law. They were more interesting-in my opinion."
3,"Interesting, yet shallow","The author wrote an interesting story, with a great ability to re-create a very specific time and place. Her attention to detail was remarkable.But...the characters are one-dimensional, and some of the action (especially near the end) borders on melodrama. Hopefully with her next book she'll be able to have plot and character development on the same level."
5,Very Impressive Young Lady,"This book helped me understand that there is an acceptable alternative to the public school norm without endangering the talents or acceptability of the child. I read the book when it first came out when my daughter was in second grade. She has been home schooled since, and is now a senior at BYU, she turned 19 yesterday. I have no regrets and if you are looking for assurance that homeschooling has a chance in your family, read the book for comfort. Not every child will match Alexandra's schedule, but most will thrive when given the opportunity."
5,Inspiration and mentor,"This book was a guiding presence as a teacher/parent in homeschooling our children. What were we to do with a 4 year old son that was reading chapter books at age 4? Public Kindergarten was out of the question, as they were just learning their ABC's. So, with the inspiration of ""No Regrets"" we accelerated our son's education. He was able to proceed in learning following his internal gifts. He began college classes at age 12 and currently holds a college math degree. Thank you Swann family for this book."
4,Inspiring,Very informative personal story. Reading her story has helped keep me motivated with homeschooling my son. She is definitely a positive voice in the homeschooling community.
3,Not a real good start,"Even though this is a very informative book, it has it's drawbacks. The information is true for the majority of the book, but has a small amount of inaccuracies. Given that this is a technical book, the text could be a disadvantage to an individual trying to pass the CompTIA exam. I would not discourage someone to use this book to pass the A+ exam, nor would I suggest it. There are many well written guides that may be less confusing than Mr. Moulton's literature."
3,Doesn't work well with Handspring Visor,"I bought this case to use with a Handspring Visor. Unfortunately the velcro that you use to attach the Visor to the case must be placed high enough to not interfere with HotSyncing. This means it must be placed on the Springboard module cover, which can slide off easily. I suppose that this would be a problem with any case which uses velcro to attach to the Visor, but if I had known I would have bought a different case. Overall its a fine case -- just not for the Handspring Visor."
5,Excellent Protective Case for my Hanspring Visor Deluxe,"This beautiful protective case for my Handspring Visor Deluxe is the most eye catching color that I'd ever seen. People ask me, what's inside? I just blush and show it to them. They love the color and style of this case and so will you!Recommendation: Strong Buy"
4,Does as Advertised.,"Simply, this is a PDA case, and functions just fine as one. Obviously it is larger than your PDA by a bit, as it must protect it, fairly slim, though. Zipper operates smoothly, and the padding works well, protects nicely. The interior velcro will hold the PDA well, but I am not sure what the elastic is for, possibly a pen, but certainly not your stylus. That's about it. A good case for the price."
3,Okay Case,"I bought this case for my Palm IIIxe, but I never really use it much anymore. I wanted something that could fit into a pocket and protect it along with clip onto a belt. I don't like having to take my belt off to put it on and I have velcro on it now. The only time I use it anymore is when I take it to school and it's raining."
2,No Frills,"There is no picture of the inside of this case becase there is nothing there - no slots for businsess cards, credit cards, extra pen, etc. This carrying case is good for a little extra protection and that's about it. But I would suggest going with something that gives you a couple more convinces if you are shopping for a carrying case."
2,Empty Inside,The Sumdex Padded Palm Wallet ia great for protection but where is the wallet where to put money. It is totally empty on the inside. No pockets no nothing.
3,Decent product for the price,"Given how cheap this case is, it's not a bad choice. It's certainly functional and serves as good protection for your handheld. On the other hand, it looks cheap. Definately not for the professional. Further, your handheld is mounted into the case with velcro and makes for a very loud noise if you need to remove it from the case. I very quickly upgraded to Handspring's own slim leather case, which is only a little more expensive but looks much better. As a budget basement case, though, this product is worth a look. Maybe you'll like it's aesthetics better than I."
1,WORST book written under the sun!!,"Disregard my rating because in truth its NO STARS for this book!!!My god, and I thought all those people bashing this book were just doing it to side with Rowling, but no. This is THE worst book you will ever read! That has been published that is. It's terrible, there aren't enough words to express how bad it is. A ten year old could write better than this, during writers block!! It's too bad though because some of her ideas had potential, but they were completly wasted on her. So sad she had to sue in order to get some acknowledgment for her pitiful work. Alas, I shouldn't be so hard on her because you know, there is one good thing about The Legend of Rah and the Muggles, it can be used as a self help book. For instance, if your hoping to become a published author someday, this book can came in handy, just keep it on your shelf under ""What not to do when writing a book!"""
3,"The Origin of the Word ""Muggle""","I'm not aware of the particulars of any lawsuit between this author and JK Rowling, but I am aware that the word ""Muggle"" is not an original creation of either author.""Muggle"" was originally a slang term from the 1920's that denoted a common person, specifically an ignorant person with no skills. In the light of JK Rowlings book, which I have not read, it makes sense that the wizards would refer to ordinary, non-magic people as ""Muggles.""I hope that helps clear up some of the misunderstanding."
1,"Dated. Very, very dated.","Folks, you have to remember that this book was written in the 1980s! This was written in the time of the Care Bears, Smurfs, the Popples. Remember all those weird social agendas pushed by colorful, bulbous, sugar-coated critters? I dare anyone to go right now and read a Care Bears book. It will make you throw up. And yet, you mention Care Bears today, and everyone in the room goes, ""awww...I loved Bashful-Heart Bear!"" or whatever.So, sure, The Legend of Rah is indescribably foul, but it is also an artifact of 1980 pop-culture nostalgia. I can even picture those bright bubbly illustrations screenprinted onto a bookbag or on the T-shirt of some retro indie kid.I read tons of horrid, really horrid books just like the Legend of Rah as a child in my elementary school library. The only difference is that those have faded into obscurity and this one has been thrust into the spotlight of our post-millenium criticism. Poor Mrs. Stouffer."
1,couldn't get through the introduction,"This is indeed a very lame book. Ms. Stouffer's language and vocabulary do not comply with her target age. Also, her plot would be totally confusing for an eight year old being as they do not understand the effects of nuclear war.I couldn't understand most of what I read or had to keep reading paragraphs over and over before they sank in (i.e. the book is extremely boring). I had to do this and I'm a 17 year old honor student who is ranked 3rd in her class."
3,Muggles & Larry Potter VERSUS Muggles & Harry Potter,"I was a child when this book, and the rest of the LARRY Potter series were published. I read them many times. I'll admit the vocab is not for the age group she intended, and the grammar is off.I've also read all five of the Harry Potter books. ..."
1,bad read,"I had difficulty finishing the first page of the introduction. Somehow a very cliched idea of corrupted government taking control, that later turns into a children's story with an undeniably contradictory plot didn't appeal to me. It seemed that, the author didn't work on the story (or editing) at all."
1,not good,"I picked this book up from the libary when I was a small kid and I remeber it confused the crap out of me. Then I re-read it again when I was thirteen, again it was still alittle confusing and plus the characters had no depth and the caracter development (if you want to call it that) was shaky and incomplete.Not good at all Nancy, It had potenital but the grammer needs alot of help and vocabulary needs to be ajusted for the traget audience plus the characters need more edge. Besides that you had a good story I suggest you read Stephan King's ""on writting: a memoir of a craft"" it just may help. and oh...about names ""potter"", ""lily""and ""james""... you and I know there common names in america but just in case you didn't know, there also very common in england and in scotland and in ireland, so it doesn't suprise me you and j.k. choose the same names. it's called a conicidence!"
1,"Rah, Rah, Rah...","All right. I'll admit it. I'm an avid Harry Potter fan, and wanted to see what the hey-diddley-ay all this 'N.K' ruckus was about.So, after finding a copy of this book in a library (which I was amazed to find, really), I had my little brother (aged seven), who, like most seven-year-old boys, enjoys 'action/fantasy' types of books, read it.He didn't like it. He told me, and I quote, that is was 'kinda boring and stupid'. He then proceeded to play with his Star Wars action figures, but that's besides the point.I then had my parents read it, of whom handed it back to me fifteen minutes later with bewildered looks on their faces. Then, I read it myself.I now feel violated.WHAT a WASTE of TIME."
1,"*shakes head* just horrible, really.","I hate bashing any writer, really, but I just can't help myself here. This book is ill-conceived, poorly-written, and, sadly, just plain stupid. Your children *would* be better off in front of a TV set, and trust me, I never thought I'd say that. The only reason for the sudden interest in it is the under-dog syndrome caused by the author's litigation against Rowling and Co. It makes me sick."
1,How is a child supposed to read this?,"That was the first question that popped into my head after reading this book. It is aimed at children 4-8, but there is no way a child this young can fully grasp the horrific post-nuclear land that Rah and the Muggles live in. It's quite depressing really. And any children older than 8 are going to be bored with these creatures in a matter of seconds. There is no substance to the story, no connection with the characters that makes you want to read on. I love reading books, even children's books, but this was a huge disappointment. After all the hype surroundidng it I expected something wonderful...or at least readable. Oh well...winter is coming up and I can always use 'Rah and the Legend of Muggles' for kindling in my fireplace."
1,Do yourself a favour - Don't read this!,"I've got to say this book stunned me. I've never read anything so ill conceived, or poorly written. I can only presume that the publishers are relying purely on curiosity based sales from the current litigation.Do yourself a favour. Read the extract that the author has published on her web site before you even consider purchasing this book. After that, you'll only want to read this book if you have a major masochistic streak."
1,Awful! ::vomits::,"I saw this at a yard sale (wonder why someone would sell it), knew how this lady was suing J.K. Rowling for ""copying"" her ideas, decided, ""Hey, I'll check this out; see if there's any truth to her claim"". The verdict?BLECH!It has no quality whatsoever, and hardly a resemblance to Harry Potter. It's written so gushy-mushy and characters are introduced without any intro I had no idea what was going on (but maybe that's for the best)."
1,"Once again I am reminded of why I tend to avoid the ""literary"" genre","While the plot of this novel caught my eye, and the first chapter or two drew me in, I found that I was quickly bored by the pretentious writing. Purple prose abounds as the author tries too hard to create meaning and metaphor in every simple action or statement. Because of the early investment in the character I continued reading until, only 40 pages left in the book, I was too painfully bored to even bother finishing it. I don't know what happens to the main character. I find that I don't even care. From my understanding, literary fiction is supposed to explore the deep truths and meaning in life, but all I ever see are self-important authors trying to be the next ""great"", demonstrating their enormous vocabularies and their ability to stretch a metaphor until it has lost all meaning."
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations after The History of Love, but this book just didn't sweep me off my feet. By the last few chapters, I was totally bored. Hopefully her next book will be another winner!"
4,Good contemporary fiction,"I really enjoyed this book, as I don't read fiction as often as I read nonfiction, and it was well written. Good exploration of loneliness, interesting twist pulling the opening section into the main plot, and easy flow of the storyline from beginning to end.When I make time to read fiction, this is the kind of book I'm happy to get my hands on. Looking forward to reading the author's second novel soon."
3,Homage to Hunter S.!,"Interesting book.... Had to get it after reading the recent New Yorker short story by Krauss. Nice mishmosh of styles.... the burned out California wistfulness, then you have Don Delillo (not in that order), then, surprisingly, the Hunter Thompson homage, hilarious quest for slides at the hospital: the Mission. Well done. Such a wistful ending, though. I was depressed when I started reading it and depressed when I finished it. Book didn't help. Looking forward to more Krauss brilliance though."
2,Easy to Put Down,"I love the potential story of this book. Someone loses their memory and can only remember up to age 12. There is SOO much one could do with this idea. However, I find myself scanning this book's text quickly trying to find interesting conversation or observations. The book transitions to the scientific side when the main character is implanted with a singular memory from another's life. At this point I lost interest.Though this book does cover some of what could be considered typical responses to losing one's memory after age 12 (you don't know your friends, your wife, you don't remember your schooling, you no longer have the education for your career), I was hoping this whole book would deal with more of those responses. Instead, the choices the main character makes I cannot relate to and then the sci fi event when a single memory is implanted into his brain happens. I guess it is a matter of expectations and I wan't expecting this novel to move to the scientific."
5,A beautiful book,"This is a book that touched me very deeply. On the one hand, I couldn't wait to get to the end to see what happens to the characters, which is a testament to Krauss's writing--she makes us care about the people in the book. On the other hand, the story is so soulful and sad-but-beautiful that I wanted to savor it. This is an intriguing, thought-provoking book that deserves even more attention than it's already received. I look forward to more from Nicole Krauss."
2,Disappointing,"Nicole Krauss can write and Man Walks Into a Room starts very well, exploring what happens when a man loses his memory as a consequence of a brain tumor. The first half is beautiful and captivating but Krauss, in my opinion, made a terrible mistake by choosing a very strange path in the second half. I don't want to give too much away, but the whole experiment set up felt fake, unrealistic and, more importantly, ridiculous and boring."
1,Boring...boring,"I did not like the story at all. I lost the interest in finish it but I continued reading hoping for some changes in the direction of the plot...big mistake. Bad, bad book."
1,Not in my room,"This is easily the worst book I have read in years.While the basic idea had me intrigued I found the book had no structure,wandered all over the place with a class of useless people.I persevered but had to give up when our hero met a girl on a bus ;she gave him her Bible and he gave her his Camera."
2,Amazon service no good for Australia,This was a good book . I had to buy it from another book store as it did not arrive for 3 weeks after being purchased on line . The purchase information said free postage . The postage cost money and was marked premium service. A friend in my book club bought from The Book Repository and was able to get it within a week. DO NOT BY ON LINE FROM AMAZON IF YOU LIVE IN AUSTRALIA AND NEED SOMETHING FOR A DEADLINE
2,A murky memory.,"First let me say that I think this novel had a great deal of potential and the prologue is fantastic -- tight construction, vivid language, and living images. From here things get very murky indeed. The plotline is sloppy, gimmicky, and meandering, and at times the writing is annoyingly self-conscious. Characters are not well developed -- this may be the ""point"" but they drift in and out of the pages uttering wise speeches and then vanish into obscurity or dissolve into vagueness. I was overall left with a very vague impression of the main characters and cared little about Samson's plight as it seemed devised only for the purpose of proving some kind of point (which is never clear and lost in the muddy middle) about modernity and memory loss."
3,Husker Du?,"The best thing about this novel's the slacker kids Lana 'n' Wingate, except the author forgets to bring 'em back at the end. Samson's a bore. The creepy scientist guy Ray reminds me of the Sirk weirdo in Magnificent Obsession. I like when mighty Samson belts him in the face, though. The dialogue's Sirk-like, too. I can't figure out the title or what Charles Bowden's blabbing about on the back cover. The prose's smooth, but too poetic for my taste. The cryptomythoreligious stuff is heavyhanded. The reason for Samson's amnesia seems like something the writer either got off the Net or asked a neurosurgeon about. Among amnesia books, this one's slight, but still a good read. My personal faves are Lawrence Shainberg's Memories of Amnesia and a difficult, mindbending book named Plus by Joseph McElroy."
5,Fantastic!,Everyone in my office is reading this book right now. It is perfect for adults and children. A must have for any library and good enough to read again and again.The cute illustrations add to the charm of an already delightful story.I recommend it!
1,Very Disappointed,There was a great review written up above that listed everything you really need to know (the first one that had a series of titles and then review). But I belive they gave too many stars and was too positive about this cam.This is not a very user-friendly camcorder. The MANUAL MUST be read over and over. It has so many steps to just do one action that by the time you have re-read the manual and adjusted the camcorder the shot is over with. Quality of pics and such was very poor once sent to the computer. The large screen wasn't much good in lighted scenes. I was forced to use the small lense to see what I was recording.I do not recommend this camcorder unless you are not picky about quality and have a photographic memory to remember how to work the camcorder.
1,My first review!,"The is my intial review of the product. After extensive search, I could find only one other review out there. I bought this camcorder today (5/15/04)and rushed home to try it out. I powered it up, opened the ""funky"" tape tray, located inconveniently at the bottom of the camcorder, and inserted a tape. Following the directions closely, I attempted to close the tray. I NEVER applied any undue force, just pushed the ""push to close"" button. Nothing happened! The camera continued to ""whirrrr"" around inside. I pulled the tape back out and tilted to camera to look inside. When I did a small pin and gear fell out onto my countertop. Disturbing to say the least. It is going back tomorrow to Target. I will probably drive over to Best Buy to re-purchase it, along with an extended warrantee! I'll keep you all posted!"
3,Okay,"This film is mainly marred by its slow pace. But even so it's an interesting film about a piece of history I had not known about, with first-rate performances (especially by Peter O'Toole in a smallish role)."
3,Molokai video review,"I watched the film Molokai and did a report on it for school. From the books that I have read the film seems to show father Damien's life pretty well. It is a great historical movie. And it is good to watch it from that point of view. If you were to watch it in the point of view of ""hot new movie"" you would be let down. But it is a very intersting movie in that it really shows the way sickness and disease were handled back then. It also shows how for so long The sick people on Molokai were ignored and forgotten about. Don't be suprised, it is a very sad movie, and leaves you feeling a little disturbed. But it is meant to. It is a movie that had to be made, and I would give it an A for effort. Pretty landscape views too."
5,True Love and great sacrifice,Father Damien demonstrates how to love GodThanks Amazon.comMolokai: The Story Of Father Damien
5,The Heart of the Matter,"This is an excellent portrayal of what the heart of the Christian message is all about; self-sacrificing love and compassion. The acting is first class, the dialogue is vivid and the movie is captivating. It is down to earth but, will lift your spirit heavenward. It will hold your interest and inspire your life with a great Christian hero."
5,"A Special Movie "" A Must See""","This was an excellant movie, was very special and moving, there are so many special people in the world that just do thing to help people and want no reward for it. But the quiet recognition that we give them only when they pass-away. But are so very special to so many people when they are with us. Father Damien was just one of those people. I would say this movie is a Must See. I enjoyed it very much and cry everytime I do watch it."
4,Liked it!,"Great movie. Good scenery, good message. Fr. Damien was recently cannonized so that makes this movie quite relevant for today. Thank goodness for modern medicine; but unfortunately there are still places that have problems similar to this."
5,Wonderful film on this servant of God,Beautiful scenery and great cast. I'm happy that this film was made to shed light on this man of faith who stepped out to love and serve others. Inspiring.
3,Fascinating and revealing...,"For those fans who aren't familiar with Aretha's Columbia work, this collection will be a revelation. I agree with another reviewer that Aretha sometimes sounds uncomfortable and that the arrangements are often conventional and forgettable. Still, within these constraints, Aretha is a force of nature! She frequently transcends the material, especially when she stops trying to sound like Dinah Washington and allows her gospel training to take over. I defy anyone to not get chills when she connects with the spirit. This collection loses points for pedestrian material and arrangements, but it's still valuable as a testament to Aretha's overwhelming talent. Well worth owning."
1,Poor Customer Service,"Our office recently added a fourth computer so it was time to purchase another UPS. We have three APC CS 500 Back-Ups already so I thought I would just go with what has worked so far. Upon reading a review of the product, I noticed that there has been a recall issued for two of our older units. It seems that some earlier units became so hot that the outer plastic case would melt. When I called APC, I was informed that the recall ended in 2008. While I can understand that a company may want to put a time limit on a recall, I am comcerned that I was never contacted by APC to let me know that there was a potential safety issue with their product. I am at the same physical address, in the same company, using the same email address as I was when the units were purchased new from Amazon. It would not have been difficult to notify me of a recall.Even though I was offered a trade-in allowance towards a new CS 500, I will look elsewhere for my next UPS."
3,Looks like the picture,Typical bendy plastic keychain. But its superman which makes it all the more cool. Wonderful little side gift to give to your favourite comic nerd.
3,The S logo is not on both sides,"Would've liked this keychain more if the S was on both sides, it's only black on one side. Also the material is kinda cheap, like rubber, a hard plate would've been better."
3,colonix,I did not like that it contained cellulose therefore I did not take it.That was money down the drain.
5,The Product Works,"Used as suggested the product works. I have used this product for a number of years, and find it more tolerable than other fibers. I mix my fiber with water using my Magic Bullet blender, which makes it smoother and easy to swallow. And yes to ""LOTTE81"" the formula has changed slightly from over the years. I had one of my older containers and noticed a difference in the taste of the fiber when I ordered a new batch, and after comparing the labels I noticed the change. But, the product still works. One might consider allowing the tea to steep 10-15 minutes if the bowels are difficult to move. I permit my regular herbal tea to steep 10-15 minutes (covered) as it delivers more flavor that way. I no longer need the KleriTea to steep so long to be effective.One should expect some discomfort during first-time use as the body is trying to rid itself of toxic matter. Once eliminated and with regular use there should be less discomfort. Good health to all. Colonix is a good product."
4,Nothing Wasted,Great product and very gentle to the system. I recommend it to anyone who hasn't cleansed the colon. It works as advertised.
1,Colonix,"I have not used it because in the instructions it stated that I need to use it for 90 days. When I was doing the research on it, it did not state that. I will probably be returning it. If I would have known the time frame from the beginning I would have not ordered it."
4,Great Product-Removes The Toxins,"Hello. I have been using the Doctor Natura and have been absolutely delighted by my results. I have used other products before but this one is certainly the best. No complaints and no embarrasing untimely trips to the bathroom. It just keeps your body ""regular"" and removes the toxins. I am so delighted that Iam going to reorder it again."
1,No result for me,"I purchased one month supply, in the hope to help my bowel movement. I have been having problems for as long as I remember. I do have more bowel movement initially but after a week, I am back to square one. I faithfully continue the product but it really doesn't do much for me. Same weight, same bowel problem."
1,This came in all stale and moist!! did not work,This came in all stale and moist!! did not work like the first time i did this last year.The product was realy old or stored improperly
1,not worth it. Rip off!,"I have been using the product exactly as directed for 2 weeks now. So far NOTHING has changed, not a thing, not my bowel movements in any way, there is no effect at all from the tea no matter how long I leave the bag in. I am not sure where people come up with these great reviews.... the product is a high-priced rip off."
2,Not for me,"Think this product is over priced for the effectiveness, at least in my case. Took it for about two weeks and wished I hadn't invested the money or time researching. However, my daughter had purchased it a couple of years ago and felt it was a good formula so guess it's a hit or miss situation."
4,Happy User,"I've used this product before and planning to buy again. I have friends and family that have also been happy with the results. I've read some poor reviews but it seems they aren't entirely attributable to the product. Everyone is different and if you are constipated you need to drink MORE water. If you have slow bowels, a problem my daughter has, you may want to consider probiotics and vitamins."
2,didn't work for me,"I have a lot of fine, wavy, dark hair, and this product didn't seem to do much for me. I was hoping this product would subtly darken my hair and also nourish it and make it softer. This product did seem to remove some of the red undertones in my hair, but didn't make it thicker or softer. This product is mainly mineral oil with dye and a bit of amla mixed in. For my hair, I prefer natural coconut oil or olive oil, so now if I wish to darken my hair I mix pure amla with either of those oils and get great results."
2,What is in this?,"I used this once. It works. My hair is stronger, slightly darker and softer. My concern is what is in this product? What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs? How pure is the oil? The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell. What is in this? I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use. The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients. Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products. I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent."
4,Cheap and effective,Had problems with hair. Now it seems that this oil is working. Just do not forget to use it periodically.
5,RICH AND WONDERFUL AMLA HAIR OIL,This oil is wonderful for the hair. Especially when you're using henna. Amla helps to keep the hair from becoming brittle and hard when using henna as a conditioner. I love it!!
2,It's very green!,"I didn't realize that it had so much artificial color in it and mineral oil. These are things I try to stay away from. However, I have used the product for about a week now. I plan to throw it out. I really haven't seen any difference other than my scalp itching like crazy and green residue everywhere. I am disappointed that it is not an all natural product."
3,Okay product,I didn't really see a difference in my hair with the product. I've been using it as a prepoo for a month now along with emu oil.
3,Stinks like a furniture polisher,"I heard a lot of good things about amla oil in general and Dabur brand in particular. I only used it once, so I can't say to what extend it helps hair growth.I doubt that I'll be using it often (if ever) though, because the smell is horrible. I used to have wood furniture polisher that had absolutely same stench."
4,Great Sticker Set,Overall I really like this sticker set. The quality seems good and the design is nice. I was in between giving it four and five stars. I think I wish there was more stickers but that may have made the product more expensive. I think it was the price that made me give it 4 stars. I think I expected to much or more for the price. I would still recommend this product.
2,Boo!,"Ms. Moore: unfailingly brilliant. Penguin's editors? Not so much. This edition has only the first three lines of Moore's excellent poem ""Poetry,"" and those three are printed inaccurately -- at least in my copy. So much for complete."
4,Xerox Quality,"Xerox copy drums, cartridges, and copiers produce high quality copies for the home and small business. We use ours for Cub Scouts. Every month we reproduce hundreds of handouts for the Pack. Our Xerox copier is fast and easy to use, and the Ink cartridges and drums last a long time."
3,Giant Redskins,These were not as flavorful as the plain nut. I was dissappointed as the old time red skins were so full of flavor.
1,My kids were horrified!,"I allowed my older kids and a friend (4 kids, ages 8-12) to watch this movie on their own. When they came upstairs to tell me about it, they were ""horrified, saddened, traumatized, and infuriated"" by the experience. They could not believe that this movie showed moms being killed (""incinerated - turned into dust"") right in front of their eyes. What could this director have been thinking? My kids state ""Kids under twelve should not ever watch this movie - they will be traumatized and will say 'Mom I want to sleep with you tonight'."" Mary says that any kid that watches this will be scared forever - kind of like the third Star Wars movie. Max feels that the animation was creepy, that it was so near to being human that the characters almost looked real, which was especially terrible when the moms were being incinerated.Please do not show this movie to your young children!"
5,Great movie!,We all truly enjoyed this movie! The picture quality was beautiful and I know I will watch it again! 3d is Awesome!
2,mars needs mom,Movie was fuzzy Not up to standard. Looked like a copy. Was not good enough to give for present. have bought many films fromamazon that were better quality
1,Earth doesn't need this movie!,"After watching this thing I wondered about what audience it was intended for. Adults will find it largely preposterous, and I'm afraid most children will be frightened- particularly when they are led to believe that their mothers could be snatched away to another planet. The movie is visually impressive- particularly in 3D, but unfortunately it's 1D plot can't sustain it."
1,More Disney Formula Income,"What has a large head with large almond eyes and long arms and long weirdly articulated legs - you guessed it, the most stereotyped shape in all of filmdom. MARTIANS!Who lives underground and has watched humans for centuries with eerily very similar technology, only more advanced because they live underground and have big heads - human writers and directors who have no imagination and keep copying the same formula over and over again.Who underwrites a formula script emphasizing largely white middle class family American values (no single people of color here) - producers who are educated in demographics and purchasing power.Who consistently does all of the aforementioned and in addition has consistently been a black hole for incorporating anything resembling the tiniest factual educative substance into their films - DISNEY!Need a real Martian in your life - watch ""Paul"" (unless you're younger than approximately 15)."
1,Disney Exec Who Approved This Needs To Be Fired,"Disney movies are generally very well-done, and very entertaining. Mars Needs Moms is neither. None of the characters are really all too likable. And it's kind of creepy how Seth Green plays the voice of the little kid. Moms tell us to throw out the trash and eat broccoli appear to be the main value of being a Mom. Really?"
3,"Not Disney's Best, But Not Bad Either","Mars Needs Moms is about a boy named Milo (Seth Green) who finds himself on Mars, trying to rescue his mother(Joan Cusack) who has been taken by aliens.There he meets Gribble(Dan Fogler),a human who has been on the planet for years, hiding from the aliens, while playing video games and some how eating and getting fat. Gribble knows his way around and has plenty of technology to help Milo on his mission to get his mom back. An alien named Ki(Elisabeth Hamois) who has learned how to speak English by watching 70's sitcoms,is also on Milo's side.The movie is sweet and charming despite some plot holes and the not too special animation. The animation kept most critics from liking this movie. I think the voice acting and charm are enough to keep viewers entertained though. The movie is touching and I found it hard not to get into it emotionally. Mars Needs Moms is occasionally fun as well. The 3-D, though I admit is surprisingly weak and hardly noticeable."
5,It's Gribbletastic,thyis movie is a2wesome. i love the story and the characters. i don't care what anybody says this movie was great. you know why it's a great movie because disney made it. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
4,Surprisingly good - 3 1/2 stars,"This is more like 3 1/2 stars than 4, but there's no option for that.When I saw the previews for this picture, I thought it looked bad. When I actually saw the film, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was (not great, but good). I saw it twice - once with my 4 year old daughter and once with my 7 year old son. Both enjoyed it and so did I.The film was quirky, entertaining and visually impressive. It did have some gentle fun with its pro-family message. Any mother could do worse than spending a couple of hours watching this film with her son.It seems a travesty that so many paint-by-numbers children's films rake in the cash (Gnomeo and Juliet?), while this film was an historic flop at the box office. It deserved better."
2,Mars needs Moms Blu ray,"What the second reviewer overlooked is that the Martians KILL yes KILL the mothers after they suck the life out of them. This plot point was not needed. This movie is NOT about family values. The reason it failed is because it's a bad movie. John Lassiter, what were you thinking?PS I would be horrified if I had a kid there at the movies who had to witness a Mom getting the life sucked out of her until she explodes(dies). Think about it. If you liked that I bet you liked Eight Below where half the sled dogs freeze to death. Another Disney non Family values movie."
2,38 Inch White Acoustic Guitar with Gig Bag and Accessories,"The bag doesn't look big enough to fit my acoustic, the strings were rusted, and it was dirty on the body. I could see where it had been spray painted white as well. It took forever to get to me as well. It's very light which I like. I would say you get what you pay for. This had a very cheap price and I don't think it's a very good acoustic guitar."
4,guitar for nephew 8 yrs old,Nephew LOVES this guitar. It was available at a very good price. He plays it everyday in hopes of becoming better.
3,Be Prepare to Change the Strings by Yourself!,"If you really want this guitar, please be prepared to change strings by yourself!Overall, it is good for beginner, but there is a serious problem on mine: there are 4 strings completely out of tune, even can't be adjusted. I am 100% sure that if I don't spend another amoung of money to change the strings, this guitar will be a trash. I wish I could have fun with it as soon as possible."

SO BUY SOMETHING ELSEOn the plus side great for smashing on stage!!!!"
1,Bad Guitar,"This guitar is horrible. $50.00 I wish I didn't spend. You cant tune the guitar, it wasn't the right color. The g string snapped 2 times, and the strings slip on the tuning device. Never buy. Buyers beware. Fraud."
2,Buyer beware.,This guitar had large scratches in it. It also doesn't stay tuned. Spend more and get a better guitar even if it's for a beginner.
3,get what you pay for,"For the price, you can't complain. Yes, it was cheaply made, but great for a child wanting to have something to play on or practice with for a starter."
3,Not all that glitters is Gold!,"Although beautiful on the outside, one of the strings broke just the second day when my daughter tried to practice with it- very disappointing. She was very sad but her guitar instructor tried for few day to fix it with replacement string."
5,How typical!!!!....,"Without the perfect cast, this movie could easily be a flop.But Patricia Arquette is here so beautiful and Woody Harrelson had never played better. Buy Buy Buy!!!!!Finish... (:"
2,NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED,"This movie is advertised as being CC, closed captioned, it is NOT. I bought this for a Chrsitmas present for a young adult who recently lost all his hearing, after searching & searching for a CC version. What a disappontment and false advertising, as well."
4,Producers need to tell the truth,"This is a good movie, great actors/actresses but the film producers need to tell the truth and give credit where credit is due. The town in the movie is Pritchett, Colorado. SE Corner. Some of the locals are from Baca County, Springfield, Pritchett, probably Walsh, Vilas, Campo. The Plainsman Herald Newspaper in Springfield, Co has a front page dedicated to this movie. The producers or scenery people went in and paid to have the restuarant made over as well as other store fronts. With all the money spent there and the locals used there, I think it would really be nice for them to get some kind of credit. I will buy the DVD, especially after buying a VHS that was so bad couldn't hear or see it, and hope the DVD is better. I know where it was filmed and know the landmarks in the movie so it is an interest to me since I lived there. And Sam Elliot is in it and I don't care if he is a bad man, he is still Sam Elliot."
3,The fragility of friendship.,"Hi-Lo country's plot has already been summarized here a few dozen times, so I'll get right to the element that followed me after I finished this film. The principle friendship, between Crudup's and Harrelson's characters, appear like many of our own at first glance: rock-solid, inseparable, and fixed upon the strongest loyalties. They fight for one another and watch each other's backs like hawks; and yet, when a woman comes into play and divides them, the wheels of their loyalty come unhinged and a crashing course of events takes place.I found this to be the chief factor of the film, and one that has essentially been the downfall of many friendships in my own circle of influence. Hi-lo country doesn't show us the way it should be when faced with divided loyalties; it shows us the way it actually is, and I applaud the film for that, if nothing else."
1,A Real Must-Miss!,"The Screaming Skull had been mentioned in Hallmark's promo video, Creepy Classics. We attempted to rent the video, but it was not available. Now we know why!While the B&W; lends a bit of creepyness to the flick, the story line was pathetic. 68 minutes was way too long! Even Elvira would not have had this on her sci-fi Saturday creep show!We had some good laughs and ... this is a must-miss video. Oh, well - nothing ventured, nothing gained."
3,"Historical Fiction-Oslo, Norway during the German Occupation","This book was originally written in Norwegian and features two Norwegian girls during the German occupation of Norway. Miriam's father was a scientist at a research lab in Oslo until her family went into hiding. This book details part of a year spent in Norway before Miriam's family escapes to Sweden. Early on in the book you meet a girl who later befriends Miriam. Both of them feel the pressures of a society that fears the Gestapo and doesn't approve of Jewish/Christian friendships.I thought the book was well written, though not exactly a challenging read, and it did manage to hold my attention."
4,The best of the Grand Finales volumes,"Of the three plated dessert books that Boyle and Moriarty made together (the other two are Grand Finales: A Neoclassic View of Plated Desserts,and A Modernist View of Plated Desserts), I would say that this one is the best. The pictures here are as gorgeous as always, but the presentations and recipes are much more feasible than the other two. Unlike a lot of the dishes from Modernist View, these ones are actually servable in a restaurant, or at a dinner party. They are not over the top dishes that are just for show. I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. The one thing that prevents it from being a 5 star book is the lack of glossary and the constant use of 'non-edible garnishes'. I am not a fan of huge sugar garnishes that no-one is going to eat, or if they do it would break their teeth. Don't get me wrong, they look really pretty, but I believe that everything you put on the plate you should be able to eat. Just difference in styles, I guess."
4,heavy on elaborate presentation,"This book is great for presentation ideas, but really is only for accomplished pastry chefs. The recipes are given only in weight, and the presentations are so elaborate that they are really unpractical, even for most restaurants. Other books give more specific directions for some of the garnishing techniques. The biographies of the pastry chefs are interesting. A nice picture book."
1,Platon's Mistake,Thankfully this book is not too expensive as it is really bad. The paper and layout are both questionable but the photos are worse than that. About three of the photos are really great and the rest are not even good.
1,a-v-r-age yawn,"a second to the review above, may be a bit more realistic at the cheaper price..but still cant understand how this got so much hype..this guy sure has alot of confidence tho, gotta hand it, I mean, Plato is one of the greatest, who is this other small fry anyway? Rather peruse the Enquirer thanks."
4,Star is fluff,"If you have time to waste, like at an airport, then I recommend this rag. It is cheap entertainment. I like that this rag downloads to my Kindle Fire, and I do not have to carry the actual magazine. It is embarrassing to be seen with this magazine, and at least on the Kindle no one knows what I am reading. Yes, I am addicted to this Hollywood gossip, but I don't advertise it."
2,Kindle version needs some work!,"I get that the Kindle version is a free add-on, but seriously--throwing up a PDF of your magazine does NOT make it a Kindle version! It is horribly hard to read and lacks any kind of functionality people are used to when reading e-magazines on Zinio or whatever.As for the print subscription, it comes a week later than the current version is at the checkout at the supermarket--I guess their strategy is to get you to start thumbing through the new issue then impulse buy even though you already have a subscription. Way to reward subscribers. Not. If my husband were not addicted to the crossword I'd cancel this magazine in a flash."
1,Tabloid!,"This is a tabloid, so most likely the stories you're reading are not true. Why would someone spend there hard earned money on a magazine that prints alot of unfounded rumors that alot times turns out to be just that, a rumor?"
4,Glossy and Enjoyable,"I have been a faithful Star reader for the past few years and sometimes their stories are right on the money. Now that Star is glossy, they really try to give Us Weekly a run for their money. I love the new glossy star, but don't like the higher price tag, so if you can afford a subscription it's worth it. They tend to cover the usual suspects as far as celebrities, and rarely do they cover human interests stories that don't have to deal with tinseltown, but if you want to read about -Kirstie Alley, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, Angelina Jolie, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, The Olsen Twins, and the usual suspects you will enjoy this mag."
3,Great exclusive pics with lies.,The one thing like about this magazine is that they have exclusive pictures on stars but what I don't like about this magazine is that they would start up rumors and make all kinds of lies.
3,Unhappy with Subscription,I am a new subscriber and I ham very unhappy. I will not order again. I get the magazines late and also I get duplicated. Where is the magazine from this week? They are in the stores but I never received mine.
3,Star Magazine site MIA,"I have subscribed to Star Magazine off and on for quite awhile. It can be entertaining as long as you don't take it too seriously, but I also love to do their crossword puzzle. This time when it came time to renew I tried to go directly to their website as usual but it doesn't seem to exist anymore. Every time that I try to go to starmagazine.com I am redirected to Radar online. Therefor I am not renewing this time until I find out what's going on."
3,"I was interested, but---","haven't we heard this interview before, say, a billion times? Kevin Smith, though brilliant, often puts words into Stan's mouth. It was ok. I got it free when I bought Spider-man, though, or I wouldn't have bought it."
5,Stan is the MAN!!,Stan Lee is the ultimate of Comic genre. He has deveopled so many comic charcter's that we have admired for a long time. He is the GOD of Comic book fantasy's. Keep it up STAN!!!
2,It's OK. Right. Uh-huh.,"These interviews were kind of interesting, but my time could have been spent better watching something else. I'm glad they were short.Kevin Smith asked a few interesting questions and Stan Lee had some fairly interesting answers. All-in-all, there was nothing on this DVD that I couldn't have lived without knowing, and I'm a comic fan.I only give more than three stars if I would watch a show again. I would not in this case. I also take away one star for Kevin saying ""Right"" and ""Uh-huh"" after every-single-sentence that Stan Lee uttered. It was annoying to the point that I almost stopped watching!"
2,Unfortunately nothing special,"I'm a big fan of Stan Lee and his comic creations. This interview covers stories about Stan and the early days of Marvel comics that have been told many times before. (In fact one of the more interesting stories -- Stan's creative breakup with Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko -- is not covered at all). There are also a few strange inaccuracies. Interviewer Kevin Smith remarks that when the Gwen Stacy character died in the Spider-Man comic she ""stayed dead"". (An odd comment since Gwen Stacy was brought back as a clone AND is featured in the current ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" title). Another disappointing thing about the disc is the frequent mentions of the Spider-Man movie. It makes the whole thing seem like somewhat of an infomercial for Marvel movie properties. Also, don't be fooled by the DVD extra -- ""the never released Fantastic Four movie"", its just Stan talking about the film, there are no clips. All in all, its not bad, but Stan deserves better."
4,"like a 20/20 for Stan ""the Man""","Marvel fans have been waiting for something like this. Stan Lee, in a sit-down interview, 20/20-style, telling about his life, his love and his work. And instead of Barbara Walters, we get the much-more-worthy Kevin Smith shooting the questions.Stan is very candid and honest and really draws the viewer in with his histories, insight and commentaries. Smith asks the questions that fans want answers to, and plenty that most of us wouldn't have thought to ask, including the issues of co-creatorship, genesis of ideas and generalities about the beginnings of Marvel.Stan Lee is as interesting a personality as anyone could ask for - he is proud of his body of work and views it very earnestly and in context.The DVD has plenty of extras, most of which are pretty short and sweet. The interview with Joan Lee (Stan's wife) is AWESOME and gives a great perspective on him as a person, and Stan's poem recital is excellent.A great DVD for comic fans that want to learn about a legend."
3,COMIC BOOK LITE,"Stan is the Man, but..Kevin Smith provides more fan appreciation than inside conversation.Fans expecting a hardcore documentary will not get it here, but they will get a nice sit down interview with Stan Lee.No great insights abound here, mainly because Stan is a charming guy - and he isn't about to dish the real goods on the industry. He remains the peerless diplomat. What you get is Stan the Man in conversation, but not Stan the self-introspective creator.This complements Stan's book biography well - which provides slightly more detail about Stan's life. I didn't learn that much about Stan and his work here, but it's fine to watch nonetheless."
5,one of the most amazing travel journals,"Stumbled onto this small work on a back shelf and bought it for a quick read 15 years ago. I have never stopped thinking about it. It is the personal journal of a young romantic on a personal quest seeking a rumored city lost in the desert of Morocco. The danger, pain and ultimate loss of his life to illness far from home is punctuated by his momentary view of the ruins, which to the true romantic, overshadowed all else. You can put yourself in his place on every page and feel his pain and exhiliration. The book is testimony to his brother who followed his trail to find the truth after his failure to return, and found the journal with the nuns who nursed him till his death. It is truly a gem in the travel book genre."
3,Nice thought but narrow,"I was excited about these shoes as I have tried the reebok kinds and nike and liked them both. I ordered a size 9 like I usually wear but it was too narrow to be comfortable. If you have even the slightest wide foot, don't go for it. Otherwise it looks like it would be comfortable."
4,"Good Sandal, nice price","The sandals arrived quickly. I've searched a long time for a basic sandal at a reasonable price. I have a wide foot with a high instep. These were a bit snug when I first wore them. Probably due to my wearing socks,too. I kept wearing them around the house for short periods. They haven't stretched out, but they've conformed to my foot, so to speak.The only problem I had is with the packaging. The sandals were shipped inside a plastic bag (and box of course). The bag had some light blue blotchy stuff on the inside touching the sandals. Kinda looked like paint. I purchased a black pair. Luckily the blotchy stuff didn't affect the sandal. So the only bad thing is that the packaging people should use better plastic bags."
3,I think they are not 100% silver/gold,The earrings are cute but they changed color very quickly (faded into some strange grayish color) and I think they are not 100% silver/gold because I got nickel allergy and I reacted on the earrings very badly.
5,The Natural Pregnancy Book,I read quite a few books while pregnant but this one stood out the most and was one of my favorites.
5,Great Advice,Very comprehansive book for those of us who want a natural approach to self care during and post pregnancy.
2,Natural Pregnancy Book review,"I consider myself something of a naturalist, but this book was a bit too obscure for me. If you are looking for more concrete advice during your pregnancy - it may not suit you. It is also helpful to have your own midwife to compliment some of the suggestions given -which I was unable to access - since the book doesn't concur with popular medicine.The section on use of herbs is very helpful."
2,Not as much information as I was hoping for,"This was an okay read, but a lot of it is common sense or things I already knew, and it's not very well written either (for instance, it contradicts itself several times). It didn't give me as much info as I'd have liked, especially since I'm trying to read the most books on pregnancy/childbirth/childrearing as I can in the time before my baby is born. There are lots more useful books out there...wouldn't recommend this one."
2,Reads like it belongs in the 1970s,"I found this book really preachy, like the authors think their audience is dumb and they need to teach readers about how bad the medical establishment is to women. I know that historically, women have been treated abominably by their own doctors, but we're living in the 21st century now, and many (most?) women are educated about how to watch out for good and bad treatment from their doctors. I felt like portions of it read like an early 70s feminist rant. (And I proudly consider myself to be a feminist.) I found all of that preachy attitude to be really unnecessary and unhelpful. Huge amounts of the book are dedicated to this, rather than towards how to actually maintain a healthy pregnancy and make natural choices. Plus, this book definitely takes the position that if you aren't doing it the author's way, you are doing it wrong."
5,Natural is the Best,"For those wanting to research natural birth options, this is the book for you! It is very concise and thorough about all phases and steps of your pregnancy, using natural remedies and methods. I especially enjoyed the sections on nutrition and herbs. Amazing! Finally a book that doesn't just rely on medical drugs and such. And there is even an appendage in the back that instructs you on how to make your own herbal teas and tinctures, for optimal health for both you and your baby. Women have been having babies for thousands of years successfully, so I definitely think we are perfectly capable of having them in this time without medical intervention."
5,vital!,i can not tell you how important this book is.......aviva is filled with wisdom.all of my friends have borrowed this book-the nursing tea is absolutly vital- whilist you are pregnant and so important to help keep up with my milk supply now that my son is 4 months old....and a huge eater...i am so pleased to find it on amazon i am sending it now to a dear dear friend!
5,Can't Beat This,"I bought this to hold my Compaq IPAQ, and it works great. For the price you can't go wrong with this case. I leave the protective jacket in the case and pull out my IPAQ when I want to go light weight. It fits just right for my IPAQ. I bought it so I can hold some business cards and have a bit more padding."
2,Not as handy as you might think...,"I ordered this because I needed to reduce the contents of my purse and I *thought* this would be a nice way to combine my wallet contents and my Visor, and reduce fumbling when I'm trying to enter info into Quicken while checking out at the store, noting return dates for video rentals, etc...HOWEVER... The space allowed for credit cards and cash in this is minimal. If you carry more than 3 credit cards and a driver's license, forget about it. It needs to be thicker (or expandable?), and the leather isn't quite as nice as I expected."
3,Looks good but does it work?,"For the most part I love my Sumdex Wallet. It hold my Palm IIIxe perfectly, I use the spare battery holder for my stylus which fits ok, and it has just enough room to hold a few business cards and a little cash. Here is the draw back... my batteries keep going dead! I am not sure if I should blame this problem on Palm or Sumdex but the power button seems to get bumped somehow when in the case and I am going through batteries like crazy. I think I am going to try another style of case and see if this resolves my problem. Too bad though, I really liked this case."
1,Not for a Handspring,"This product is advertised as being able to fit any Handspring model, wrong! While it does fit, barely, it is too snug and applies too much pressure to the PDA screen resulting in battery drain. The loops for the pen work great if you want an average size pen to stick out of your case 2 inches, and the loops are too big to keep a stylus securely stowed away. I don't care for the velcro on the back, makes it hard to write cause the pda rocks back and forth on the velcro. I bought this case to use while I searched for the perfect case cause of the low price, wish I hadn't now."
3,"Good, but not for me (and you, may be)","When I looked at this case on this site and on the manufacturer's site I really liked it. It has everything I sought except one thing - it is too small to accomodate my Pocket PC (Cassiopeia E-125). It fits too tight to put anything else but the PPC inside, and all these handy pockets become unusable. Otherwise it is great item and if you have a device smaller than 3.25""x5""x0.75"" you will enjoy this case to the maximum extent possible."
2,Nice organizer,"This is a nice Palm Organizer. Leather is nice, yes, it's also really professional looking. The only problem for me is that it didn't fit my philips nino. But for the other palm pliot users, it should be fine. The price is very resonable too."
4,Good Case for IPAQ,"IPAC 3635 fits nicely with expansion pack sleeve. Good quality leather. Only down side, velcro belt loop."
4,Amazing pianist,"Perahia did an amazing job with Chopin's Etudes. I loved every minute of this CD, in that hes an absolutely amazing technical player, and is almost as good at emotional playing. The only thing I didnt quite like was the way that he played parts of Revolutionary. I'm playing this piece right now, and my teacher insists that I use less pedal, but he still does an amazing job. Not sure if there should be a big bang at the end of the song or not, but I assumed there should because its marked forte or double forte depending on version, and didnt really hear that. Overall, though, this is an amazing CD"
3,Lacking emotional impact,"Here is a CD with brilliant technique and an emphasis on structure. However, as with other Perahia CD's, I find these readings to be emotionally detached. Try Rubinstein or Biret. OK for those who like fleet fingers at supersonic speed. Good sound"
5,Christmas Stories,"These were very good stories - well written - in fact my personal opinionthey would make great made for TV Christmas movies.""A Christmas Gift""definitely had humor and ""Winter Wonderland"" well a couple of times I wanted to ""take Barnaby Traherne"" in tow - to hold a grudge so long- butit was good to find out he did have a ""forgiving heart"". Very good."
4,Great stories to read in winter,"These are 2 short, clean and fun books to read in the winter. The price is just perfect.I gave it 4 stars because I just wished her regency books were a little bit longer. She is so talented and could have easily expanded on the characters to make them even better."
4,A thorough and interesting study of getting married!,"I found the book to be wonderfully researched, entertaingly written, and quite a resource. The writer has a flair for making the most mundane quite fun. She took the tediuousness out of the wedding process. Kudos for such a nice job."
2,Not as good as the others in the series,"I've used the unofficial travel guides for years and I usually love them so when I was getting married I decided to give this book a shot. Unfortunately, I just didn't find it very helpful. It's full of very practical suggestions but these are all common sense items which most people figure out on their own. I didn't find anything that made me feel this book was worth the read."
2,"Pots are adorable, but not functional","I ordered these pots 9 months ago. They arrived & were so adorable. After 9 months, they faded, one rusted thru. No drain holes which is poor. They're very small, perfect for tiny plants. Very disappointed that these did not hold up."
5,I wish I had found it sooner!,Great resource! Very well laid out. This should be an essential book in pre marital counseling. Super easy to follow.
4,Helpful Insights,"The Boundaries in Marriage Book & Workbook have provided invaluable insights for me. In a society where marriage and commitment are under attack this set provides information on how to be proactive in sustaining marriage, and how to be healthly while participating in transforming a struggling marriage into a strong one."
1,Overblown with purple prose,"Perhaps it is the sickly hedonism of these books that make people look past the college-student level writing and proclaim it as ""dazzling."" I don't see it, personally. The crashingly bad language juxtapositions give me headaches [""love as thou wilt"" in contrast with the ""Phedre's boys"" chant.] It is treacly and cutesy, the prose fraught with purple yuck.If you want perverse sex [which personally doesn't bother me] disguised as art [this part DOES bother me], then by all means read these books. I am hoping that this is just a passing phase in fantasy, one that will be over and done with quickly."
4,Almost as good as the first.,"Although I enjoyed the first and last of this triology a little more, I thought this second part was vital in understanding the growth in all of the main characters, especially Phedre and Joscelin, and their heartbreaking relationship. This second book really explores the challenges Phedre must face with the burden of the entire nation of Terre D'Ange on her shoulders. The word smithing is once again one of Carey's greatest strengths. With this installment of Kushiel's Legacy, expect a slightly slower plot line, but an ending segment that will leave you on the edge of your seat! I highly recommend it."
5,A Fascinating Sequel,"Kushiel's Chosen is of the same calibur as Kushiel's Dart! I absolutly LOVED it! Jacqueline Carey is now one of my favorite authors, her books just bring you into a believable realm that makes you never want to put the book down. Her vivid imagry and compelling style of story-telling is so captivating. This book was truly excellent, there are so many plot twists, that even I couldn't figure it out until I read what truly happened; it just keeps you guessing. And, I have to admit, I was so worried about what would happen between Phedre and Josceline! The emotional reactions that Phedre has are so believable, and you know the characters so well that it almost makes you cry when one of them is lost. All-in-all, this book kept me enchanted until the very end, (very suprising end indeed!) and I can't wait for Kushiel's Avatar to come out next year!! Trust me, if you loved Kushiel's Chosen, you'll love this one as well."
5,A great adventure!,A terrific read and nail biting to the end. Jackie's world of Terra D'Ange is vivid and alive. What kind of world would have happened had Jesus and Mary Magdalena....
2,Loved 'Dart' hated 'Chosen',"Having read and loved the first book, it pains me to say I barely made it halfway through the second book before giving up in frustration. I just found some of the characters just too incredibly loathsome I couldn't be bothered anymore."
4,"A great book, but it didn't live up to my expectations","The first book in this series, Kushiel's Dart, was a beautifully written beginning to the Kushiel's Legacy series. It left me eager for her next installment, and I probably built it up too much to have it fulfill what I was hoping for. It moved slowly in the middle, and the intrigues were not nearly as interesting for some reason. I think it was that there were unfamiliar names or that the book began in the relative peace of Ysandre's rule.It is a mark of how beautiful Carey's writing is that I was disappointed by this book and still give it four stars. Her language is amazing, and the settings she's created are amazingly detailed. The plotting in this book, although just as intricate, was slightly more difficult to follow. Overall, it's my least favorite of the three, but still well worth buying and reading, both of which I have done."
3,"Good, but not great.","Kushiel's Dart was brilliant, no question there. But the sequellacked in a few ways that left me happy but disappointed.Primarily, the framework of the story is nearly identical to theoriginal. Phedre in the service of Namaah, searching her assignations for any clues of treachery against the crown. Aquest to search out her most hated enemy. Captured, escaped,travel through a strange and exotic land...Even the sequence of events is the same! Regardless of thesethese flaws, I managed to hold on to enjoy the story. I hope ""Phedre's Boys"" like myself, did the same andhad a good time revisting old friends and the world of Terre D'Ange."
5,"Blessed Elua, she is safe!","Phedre continues her adventure in her search of her nemesis, which she will find in the last place she will look. (as the oracle predicts for her)Though with somewhat less events than the first novel, Kushiel's Chosen beautifully continues Phedre's story in the race against time to save her Queen."
2,Check it ouf from the library instead.,"To be honest, this book could have been a lot better. As its predecessor could have been as well.There were times where I thought to myself: ""Did an editor really let that slip? Did that grammatical error really mean to be there?"" Answering yes or no doesn't take away the lack of fluid writing one should expect of this genre. Thus, this book is sadly disappointing because it makes the story less than what it could be. It could've been brilliantly engrossing.Let me reassure you-- the plot basis is actually quite good. Yet, I felt at times that I was reading some paperback romance instead of fantasy. It was not as original as I had hoped, with a very predictable set of scenarios.I wouldn't buy it. Get it from the library if you enjoy the idea of an anguisette. Your money is better spent elsewhere."
2,Disappointing,"Kushiel's Dart was a book deserving of most of the praise it got. Kushiel's Chosen proves that, more often than not, lightning does not strike twice in the same place.What in Dart was dramatic, in Chosen is melodramatic. What was sexy in Dart is overdone in Chosen. What was interestingly evil [Melisande, one of my favorite villianesses of last year] is now flat and screechy, reminding me of Rita Repulsa in the old Power Rangers cartoons.Some stories are epic enough to nake into series or trilogies. Some do better on their own. The Terre d'Ange is one of those. Harsh as I know it must be to tell a writer who has poured as much effort into world development as Jaqueline Carey has that she should move on to bigger and better things, Jackie, move on. Characterization is not your strong suit."
3,Not Bad,"The book was not a bad read, but I found the main character to be quite Mary Sueish. She's just a little too perfect for my taste."
4,Excellent,A great series. I am completely addicted to Phedre and her adventures. Jacqueline Casey has mastered the art of taking her readers into Terre d'Ange and keeping you there. She writes as if she has actually seen this country and known the characters personally.
3,"Compelling, but very similar to the first book","I found the book entertaining, a compelling read, hard to put down. It keeps the reader interested and it definitely has its moments. The main characters go through a few new experiences and learn new things about themselves.On the downside, there's both re-telling of the first book, and the second book follows very closely around the pattern laid out in the first. Throughout the book, there's a lot of Delaunay this, Selig that. A bit of retelling is great to provide context, I think it's tedious if the same thing is repeated over and over.I wish it had a better ending. Why use the same cliffhanger twice?"
5,Spellbinding,"I wouldn't agree that the novel seems hastily written, I found it cohesive and completely addictive. The development of the characters from Kushiel's Dart is believable, and very enjoyable. Melisande continues to be a formidable adversary and one wickedly enjoyable to read about."
5,Who says sequels can't deliver,"Kushiel's Dart was GREAT! Kushiels Chose was equally GREAT!Once you pick up this book, you may find out just how quickly you can read a 700 page book. This is truely a great storyline, with well developed characters in a fantastic setting. Phedre and Joscelin of course return in this book (right on the heels of where the first book ended). Will they find the elusive Melisandre? Read this book and find out, you won't be at all sorry."
5,Fantastic Sequel leaves you begging for the conclusion...,"This book was the first sequel in a very long time which I've read and enjoyed so much. The intrigue, the suspense, the love, the terror, the faith, of humankind are amazingly captured on each page by Carey. I look forward to reading Kushiel's Avatar..."
2,"Flabby and overhyped, but still an interesting read","Phedre is back in her ongoing pursuit of sex and power in the sequel to Kushiel's Dart, one of the most praised books of last year. The early review copies drip with praise that has always been over the top in my mind, but there was no denying that Dart was a startling read. Kushiel's Chosen is a decidedly less impressive. The character of Melisande has gone from menacing to annoying, while Phedre is suffering from Honor Harrington Syndrome; is there no trial too great for our heroine to overcome?The excessive praise heaped on this series is just that--excessive. Which is a shame, because it ends up meaning that the praise that IS deserved--this is a mostly interesting, though not earthshattering book--gets lost in the great hype, which only serves to make the experience disappointing..."
5,Second Book Even Better,"This second in a series of three novels featuring the heroine Phedre is even better than the first. Ms. Carey has come up with a practically seamless story that is complicated, vivid and fascinating. Her writing is so sensual and detailed that the reader becomes lost in her exotic universe. To any complaints about this novel and this series, I would say, ""It's a fantasy!"" It is exactly what it is supposed to be, and a masterful example, too. Highly recommended."
4,none,"Countinuing the saga that changed the face of fantasy, Carey gives us another, nearly poetic novel of myth, mayhem, intrigue. Beautifully written and a sheer pleasure to read. Gary S. Potter Author/Poet"
5,Very Good Stuff!,"The second book of the trilogy.Once again Phedre takes us on a mind blowind adventure. This book was just as good as the first, and gives us more of the same igredients like suspense,intrigue,action,love,and last but not least sex. Phedre is thrown into yet another twisting plot of deciept,the tale unfolds before your eyes in an intricate pattern that will have you turning the pages like an addict. The new characters are great, Joscelin is still a hottie, Phedre still loves/craves pleasure with pain. If you loved the first, you'll adore the second.Recommended indeed."
2,Could have been a lot better...,"Wow-I couldn't put this book down, not for lack of trying. There was a great plot here, but the characters (other than Phedre) lacked consistency. The writing was over dramatic for my tastes. In my opinion, Carey should have taken out more of the meaningless characters and elaborated more on the important ones."
2,Never really read it...,I think I read a chapter of it for my grad school seminar. I was bored and never really picked up the rest.
1,Short lived scale,"I had this scale for about 6 months, and it was very accurate, but this morning my weight was down by about 20 lbs. I figured it was just weak batteries, but it went even crazier after I put in new ones. Guess it's just a piece of trash now, plus I'm out the $4 cost of the new batteries, which aren't useable in anything else. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in the quality."
2,Skip this unless you want a scale that looks nice but doesn't work.,"It looks nice, reasonably priced ($20), but is completely worthless for what it's for. Most of the time it fails to measure your weight (returns with the result of ERR). I find that standing completely still for about 7 seconds (approximately the amount of time it takes to give you a reading) helps avoid the dreaded ERR result. Unfortunately, when it does return something, it returns measurements that can vary by as much as 2 pounds for the same person. Maybe I have a defective product or just expecting too much for a $20 scale? YMMV."
1,Dont buy this item!,"I am recluctant to write something that is such a bad review, but I feel that I must warn people. The battery they say is good for the life of the product, but after a few months, the display screen keeps reading ""error"". Also, according to this scale, I can change my weight in one day as much as six pounds! One time I stepped on and it read one thing, and not more than 20 seconds later, after letting the screen clear, I weighed 5 pounds more!my mother also owns one, and hers does the same thing. She was trying to lose weight and this discouraged her so much she ended up chucking it out."
1,Inaccurate - weight can vary by up to 3 pounds; sometimes refuses to get a reading,"This cheap scale gives me a different reading by a pound or two or three if I just move it to a different spot on the floor.Even more annoying is about 25% of the time it can't get an accurate reading and just says ""ERR"" then I have to shake it and try again."
1,Terrible,"When this scale arrived, the battery was dead. I called the company and they sent a new battery which took over a week. Now with the scale ""working"", it takes almost 10 seconds for the weight to show up on the screen and further, 8 times out of 10 the scale reads ""ERR"" and I have to get off and get back on. In addition, this scale reads over five pounds more than the scale I weigh in on at Weight Watchers. I would NOT recommend this scale to anyone else."
1,I would give it no stars....,"I bought this scale because I figured the price was right. Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.First of all, it is flimsy in construction. I am under 200 lbs., yet when I step on it, the cheap plastic bends down. You can just feel how thin and unsubstantial the plastic is.Next, the first time I weighed myself, I found that I had lost 7 lbs. overnight! If only this were true. I didn't believe it. I stepped off and got back on and I had gained back 5 of the lost pounds. Off and on again -- and I was up another 4.If you like to just kind of average your many readings, then this scale will work for you. Otherwise, take a pass.BTW, and I was using it on a flat hard surface."
1,Taylor 7000 EXP Precision,"This scale worked exactly ONCE. It broke almost immediately. The readings are way off now, when it offers up a number at all. DO NOT BUY."
3,Difficult to read dial,"Be aware that this DOES NOT have a lighted dial and is therefore very difficult to read the weight. On the plus side, it registers in half pounds which is a boon for anyone trying to lose weight."
2,Silly,"Don't expect to be scared unless you are under 10 years old. Silly movie that is laughable at best. The set looks like it was made in 6th grade art class. I laughed at it throughout and then I wondered why I actually bought it! But if you collect silly B horror movies, you just might like it. No where near the B status of The Blob!"
1,Crazy Mist Movie,"One of the most simple and stupid movies ever but just like a car wreck you will slow down to watch. If you like ""B"" horror movies then this is right up your alley. If you need suspense or a plot that just keeps you on the edge of the seat then pass on this one."
3,I started to give it a thumbs down.,This one came up short of entertaining. Must of been pretty desperate back then. But hey you got to make a livng somehow.
4,Good Movie,"This is a movie that I had been trying fo find for years. Saw it a long time ago, and finally found it. Good job by Forest Tucker."
4,"It still scares me, even though I'm not a child any more....","Okay, I first saw this on TV and it really creeped me out, especially the foggy cloud. Over the years, we rented it a few times, so I finally bought it and found I still like it a lot. The eye itself is a bit silly, but the overall atmosphere, the psychological aspects of a compelling force and the scenery make it a winner."
4,Enjoyed.,"I like this movie since I first saw it when I was younger. good story line, but special effects are typical 50's."
1,Crawling Eye unexpected Disappointment,"I like to collect old horror movies. I'd seen this movie several times and was looking forward to seeing it again. When it arrived, I was shocked to see that the movie on the cd was something else entirely. The packaging said the name of the movie, even the writing on the cd said The Crawling Eye. I returned the movie and ordered a replacement, investigating the company Image Entertainment. Same thing happened again. The case was for the Crawling Eye, the writing on the CD was The Crawling Eye but on the CD was another movie entirely, Night of the Ghouls, just like the other. Now I had two let downs. I returned them both very upset. I still do not have The Crawling Eye to enjoy like I hoped. I'm hesitant to try and order it again and have no idea how I'm going to find this movie. I was unable to change the star rating when going through this process so definitely no stars on this product."
4,Better then you would think,"Psychic. Dead men rising to kill. Mind control. Decapitations. What more could you want? A very good 50's sci fi entry. They get it right most of the way through by building dread about what is coming down the mountain in the cloud. Forest Tucker and others lend better acting then often seen in these movies. I'm not even going to cite them for the appearance of the monster as some do. It was the 50s. It was made on a shoestring budget. What do you expect? My only beef about the movie is the americanized title (and the DVD cover). They should have stuck with the Trollenberg Terror as the name. They spend the majority of the movie building the suspense of what is coming after them, however with the title of ""The Crawling Eye"" the suspense is muted to the first time viewer. You know what is coming."
3,AN OLDIE,"THIS MOVIE IS NOT TO BE WATCHED AT NIGHT, ALONE. IT'S DONE IN BLACK & WHITE. IT'S SCARY AND IT HAS A LOT OF KICK TO IT. IT'S AN OLD ONE, BUT A LOT OF THESE ""OLD MOVIES"", BLACK & WHITE OR COLOR CAN PUT A LOT OF THESE NOW MOVIES IN THE TRASH CAN."
3,THE CRAWLING EYE (TROLLENBERG TERROR),"Perhaps because I wasn't expecting too much I was pleasantly surprised to see and enjoy this old film after all these years. I believe I first saw this film on New York television featured on the Million Dollar Movie, and am quite certain that I did not catch this film in the theaters. While not the most memorable film it did include some nice features like the good model work, very fine painted backgrounds and beautiful scenery.The story held my interest and entertained to the end. The creature effects were accomplished with model work and props supported and animated by wire. Here it suffered a bit but not much more than similar movies filmed within the limitations of a small budget. It is definitely worth a look and gets three stars from me as decent early sci-fi which took advantage of lots of stock footage."
1,Be advised,"Watch out purchasers of this fine classic horror film... I, like a few others received DVD titled ""The Crawling Eye"" and got ""Night of the Ghouls"" instead. Hopefully, Amazon will check for other missprints of this disk to avoid future mistakes."
3,Eye like it anyway,"Much is made of the ""quality"" of the creatures in this movie, but when I saw it as a kid I gotta confess, I LIKED the eye creatures! That image stayed with me for (ahem) years... Seeing it more recently, I think the main problem in terms of effects, is not necessarily the design of those unblinking beasties, but more the look of the miniatures, particularly the fire. You know, where it looks like someone's kid threw a match onto the landscaping of their Father's train set?... Be that as it may, I still have fun with this movie, as I think most weirdo's who love 50's sci-fi will...<HM>"
2,Well-Acted but Hampered by Poor Special Effects,"The Crawling Eye (1958), directed by Quentin Lawrence and starring Forrest Tucker, is a film about alien creatures residing in the Swiss Alps with the ability to disguise themselves in radioactive vapor. The action is slow-going throughout much of the film, which centers around a human female discovered to have a telepathic link with the aliens, as well as a series of murders in which the victims are decapitated. Later, however, in one of the film's more interesting subplots, the aliens decide to possess the bodies of their victims rather than decapitate them, for the purpose of killing the aforementioned female (they don't want her exposing them with her telepathic ability). The big eye creatures themselves, with their long tentacles, look ok, but film plummets in rating from good to fair because of below average special effects. Adapted from a British tv series The Trollenberg Terror."
3,Fist class film transfer of a terrible but funny classic!,"This movie was really scary for us kids back in 1958... but pales by todays standards of a convincing horror film...... HOWEVER... this movie and the DVD is an EXCELLENT wide screen transfer and looks terrific. And quite honestly, the movie itself is so bad, its REALLY FUN to watch with your friends. The acting isn't bad, except for the professor, who is really forced in his role..... but Tucker saves the film along with Miss Monro, who is convincing as the girl the monster wants to quiet. This DVD is also very reasonably priced..... I hope the DVD company (Image Video) gives us more like this title in such creative and impressive transfers!! Thanks also to Image for the extras and cool menu montage!"
3,"Cheesy, but entertaining","This film is somewhere betweeen classic sci-fi and the sea of driftwood cheeseball 50's monsters. It has a dreadful giant eyeball with tentacles, a ridiculous story that makes the science on Irwin Allen shows look intelligent, but it is entertaining and it has Forrest Tucker. The story is bad, but somehow interesting and I think that is just because the cast seem so convincing about their fear of the monster. The main standout is Forrest Tucker, a good performance can make an average film good, as is the case in this film. Tucker plays an adventurer-tough guy to the hilt. In this movie and the Abominable Snowman he is like the sci-fi version of John Wayne. This film is worth seeing at least once."
4,Singularly Underrated,"Why this movie is considered some sort of ""Golden Turkey,"" worthy of Ed Wood's imprimatur is beyond me. It's not ""Gone with the Wind,"" to be sure, but it's never pretended or claimed to be. ""The Crawling Eye"" is an entertaining and engrossing film. Everyone does a good job, particularly the always underrated Forrest Tucker and the absolutely bewitching Janet Munro. Want a movie you can watch numerous times over the years? Then ""The Crawling Eye"" is your baby."
1,MISLABELED!,"Although the packaging of the DVD box and the DVD itself says that this is The Crawling Eye, it is mislabled. The DVD is actually Ed Wood's ""Night of the Ghouls"". There is no ""Crawling Eye"" on this DVD. Be warned!"
4,Chilling terror,"In the style of 'you don't see the monster until it's too late', this is a very chilling setup. Adapted from 'The Trollenberg Terror', everything takes place on a lonely mountain far from help. The monsters are never seen until the end, only spoken of. You see the effects long before you see them.Look for Forrest Tucker (of 'F Troop' fame) in the lead.And for the Adults, look for a scene involving a couch and a woman bent over that, incredibly, escaped the notice of the censors. 'Nuff said."
3,ONE EYE POPPING MOVIE,"Story takes place in the mountains, when strange things begin to occur. Shroud in a blanket of fog a monster lurks.I thought the movie was good during its time. I loved the eye, its great."
4,"A fun movie, almost a minor classic.","This movie is a fun, scary time . From the first scene with the mountain climbers to the final siege at the Alpine fortress this flick will keep you interested . While the effects are not what we are used to today, they were good for their time,and the acting was quite good (Forrest Tucker's in particular). If you like 50's Sci-Fi, you will like this movie."
3,Not as good as I hoped to remember. But it was ok.,You dont really see the eye until close to the end. And you do see the sarge from f-troop playing the leading role. I guess the atmosphere was ok to make this a time killer. But I have seen better.
4,crawling eye on you,The Crawling Eye is fun to watch if you have a few hours to kill and notch another old but goodie sci-fi movie on your list. The wait for the monsters is worth it when you see them for the first time well into the flick. One nasty looking creature and maybe the most unusual monster in movies period. Forrest Tucker is great in this little gem. watched on 16:9 wide screen and the image was superb. There are a couple of enjoyable goofs in this film that includes a crew member visible in one scene! But I strongly recommend this movie.
5,Excellent copy.,"This is such a flawless copy that I am amazed by it. If you compare the movie to the trailer you really appreciate the difference. However, it is NOT widescreen. This did not matter one bit to me, most of the action takes place indoors any way. It is an excellent addition to my ever growing collection of '50's Sci-Fi and I wish all my collection were such excellent copies."
3,Fun to read but not always too accurate,"Scalp Dance tells the story of the Plains Indian wars from 1865 to 1879 making extensive use of first-person accounts. However, please be aware that most of the quotes in Scalp Dance are from secondary sources, not the original documents. Yes, it's fun to read, but I wouldn't recommend referring to it if you are writing your own book on the Indian Wars. Just spot checking what I was reading today, I came across two errors: 1) Washakie was not in the battle of the Rosebud (he didn't join with Crook until July 11), and 2) one of the quotes was not used properly. Again, the book is fun to read, but I wouldn't depend on it in my own research. Best to go back to the original documents that he quotes."
4,The Indian wars from the participiants view,"Tells the story of the indian fighting the decade after the Civil War. Much from letters and diaries. Gives some insights in the fighting but no analyzis, no tactics nor a good discussing summary. But you get the feeling of being at the ""frontier""."
2,To one sided,"This may be factual but does not present both sides. It favors the white mans side only. Showing the terrible things the Indians did, but not what provoked them. It gets boring after awhile. The white man commited many crimes against the Indians. The book basicly only showes one side."
5,America's First War on Terror,"If you want to understand the dynamics of the plains indian wars, you MUST read this book. Scalp Dance gives you an up close and personal look at the atrocities and danger that frontier people lived with daily. One of my favorite subjects is the Indian Wars (both in the east and west), but anymore it is virtually impossible -- and I mean IMPOSSIBLE -- to find books that aren't extremely PC and insultingly one-sided. This book is the antidote. Before you cast aspersions on the people involved in these conflicts, read this book, and ask yourself, ""What would I do in the same situation?"""
1,Incompatable with HP Jornada 568,Purchased for use with my HP Jornada 568. Because of a raised bevel on the front of the card - it will not fit in the CF type II slot on the Jornada 568.
2,"Does NOT work with Ipaq ROM update, Zero Support from Xircom","This modem does NOT work with the Ipaq ROM update. While Compaq hopes to resolve this issue, Xircom has provided ZERO support. This modem is priced at premium level, and Xircom's most recent web page highlights the Compaq Ipaq SPECIFICALLY, yet there has been no software/driver update for over a year. Not a satifactory choice at this point."
2,Disappointed in workmanship,"I was disappointed in the workmanship, since I had only worn the gold ones for about 4 hours and a portion of the front piece broke off. Haven't tried the pearl ones yet."
1,Broken Earrings.,"One of the earrings is fine and the other one the magnet is in wrong or something, they won't stick together."
4,Well done indie flick!!,"I saw this movie at a film festival in Los Angeles and was pretty impressed. I don't know what the guy that hated it was looking for but he's off the mark on about all of his critiques. The director spoke after the screening and mentioned all the awards this won (for himself, the cast, and the movie).If you're looking for an original, thought provoking, well made movie, I've gotta recommend this one...if you're looking for the latest cookie cutter, multiplex, by the numbers movie, then stay away."
2,not worth the time,"hate the way this movie ended, and the message was never really a good message that was put out by the movie"
2,Broken Fences,"This film had the potential to be great. I didn't really like the direction the story took. Oh well, but a sound track could havereally added some depth.The scenery was nice."
3,May be best of the type,"But it still will test your patience if you already have any knowledge about automobiles. Some of the material is digressive, and I could not fathom reading the whole thing for enjoyment."
3,Best of The Monogram Chan,Meeting at Midnight has the honorable distinction of being called(at least by me) as the best of the poverty-row Monogram productions. One good thing about this one is Sidney Toler. I have never had any interest in watching Roland Winters play Chan!
3,Trim candles base,I had to trim the candles base to fit in holders. I really like the look and craftmanship of the holders.
4,"Fun to Read, but you need a score card for all the names.","I am a fan, so I can honestly say, this is not the best book the author has written. However, it is an interesting one, and after a few chapters you have made friends with her new cast of characters. The only problem is keeping track of them - since they all seem to have 2 names, their Irish name and their Italian one. Gets a little confusing at times, especially if you can't read the book straight through. It lived up to any expectations you might have for the author's books and certainly was entertaining."
2,Don't enroll in classes based on the text of this book!,"I am one who eagrely purchases every Maeve Binchy novel before the ink is dry. This novel proves my past experiences - that Maeve's books are either excellent or boring.If one bases any desire for new experiences on what one reads in books, I would say that the idea of travelling to Italy definitely will be a wonderful experience. But, having myself sat through the endless drudgery of night classes, I think Maeve's depiction of this situation is about as believable as meeting a Martian on the front porch."
4,another few chapters please!,"Binchy's books are always a great and comfortable read, full of chat and colloquisms from Ireland. I loved this book, and found it all plausible and entertaining right up until the party and the trip to Italy. At this point I felt the coherency of the book started to unravel - just how did Lou get on with Robin? Would it be that easy to lose those underworld connections? And what about Connie and Jacko? Did they meet up or not? Did Liz calm down her excessive spending? Did Bill come to terms with the Olive situation? Usually books by this author are great in they way they are all neatly wrapped up at the end, and while it's easy enough to imagine happy endings for these characters, slightly less harsh editing would have improved this book immensely. Read Copper Beech - an example of this author at her best!"
3,Light reading,"This was my first Maeve Binchy book---both this title and the author was recommended by a friend. I enjoyed the book very much. I would call this light reading with a happy ending for all. There are a lot of characters (maybe a few too many)that are easy to like and sympathize with. The only criticism I have is that a couple of them seem a little one-faceted, and the storyline of Signora I felt to be too implausible. (What woman would really follow her lover home to Italy just to be near him, content to watch him and his wife and children from a room across the street for twenty years until he died? ) But all in all, this is a good book to check out from the library."
2,This book reminded me of a bad soap opera,"What a piece of drivel! Maeve Binchy is such a good storyteller; what would possess her to write something as contrived and predictable as this? The characters, the plot, the dialogue, and the setting were so ""calculated"", it seems as if the entire book was written for the Hollywood screen. The only thing this book had going for it, was that it moved at a quick pace, and didn't drag on. I couldn't put the book down, but all I kept thinking was 'when is this going to end'"
4,My review,"Maeve Binchy has a special gift for setting up plots that have you totally engrossed in them.In this case, I could almost feel the loneliness and pain that Nora feels when she has to return to her native country. Just to feel close to her previous life, she turns to teaching her favorite language, Italian.Great plot, great characters that you learn to love and hate. It will keep you up at night just thinking what may happen to them!"
3,Left Me Feeling Incomplete-Could Have Been Better,"Evening Class was interesting enough to keep on reading through it to see what happens. Each chapter begins with another character telling their life story.Aidan Dunne is the first character in the story. He is unhappy in his life with his now two grown daughters, and distanced from his wife. When the evening class came along, it brightened his spirits; especially with the instructor Signora.Signora is quite an eccentric. The instructor of the evening class, she makes italian fun and exciting to learn for the students.Other characters are Bill, Laddy, and Connie. All have lives that will intertwine with one another in different ways. The story on each though, is incomplete. That's what made the book not so good."
4,Should we start our own Italian Courses ??,"This is a very good book about foreign language courses. I participated to many of them in Ankara in my past. I feel that teachers will find good clues how to make their courses productive, exciting and full of fun."
5,IT was as if she was writing about OUR evening class!!!,"I read Maeve Binchy's book Evening Class well before I actually went to an evening class, where I too learnt Italian. It was bizarre that the book could be so close to real life! Our Italian class brought together people of such different backgrounds yet by the end we had formed such a great group. Maeve Binchy, for me, is the consumate author - she writes beautifully and tells a story, taking you on the journey. And yes, my Italian teacher had read the book but no, she didn't take us to Italy on a holiday!"
5,"mysterious beginning, normal ending","Maeve Binchy demonstrated the different perspective of a personality in Nora's character. Like most of her books, this one raised my suspicion to it's highest peek, but the end was normal. Still..a great book and highly recommended."
3,reveals to much,"as many state Maeve Binchy has a possibility to describe complex characters and create an atmosphere you never forget. However, in doing so she brings out a feeling of misstrust as se never leaves anything unsaid. Even what is obvious is spoken of, instead of leaving this to the readers imagination."
3,Not the typical Binchy,"Maeve Binchy is becoming one of my favorite authors. Evening Class is the 4th Binchy book I have read, but it is not the typical Binchy book compared to Circle of Friends, Glass Lake and Echoes. I was left not really knowing the characters. Because there were so many characters, Binchy was not able to fully develop them. I did not walk away feeling like I really can relate to any of the characters. The storytelling part of the book is very grand. Binchy is truly a master to interweave so many characters together. My next one will be Light a Penny Candle!"
2,Binchy's WORST...,"This was the second Binchy novel I read (I have since read them all) and have noticed a pattern. Binchy's books, as one reviewer pointed out, are either wonderful or horrible. This particular publication falls to the latter. The characters are plastic, the situations boring and the whole of Signora's background histrionic. The subsequent romance is forced and - once again - Binchy's male lead is an adulterer. Worth skipping. Instead, if you want a good Binchy novel, read Tara Road or The Glass Lake."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Pretty good book. I do love how Maeve brings minor characters from her other novels to the forefront of new novels. I remember hearing about Nora O'Donoghue in other works -- Quentions, Tara Road, Scarlett Feather. So it was nice to hear her story. But I felt like there were one too many characters -- Laddy's backstory and contributions didn't seem to contribute much to the storyline, and I found Lizze to be the most obnoxious character. But overall, in typical Maeve Binchy fashion, as the book progressed, their stories became more and more intertwined, eventually intersecting at the end. Good story over all!"
4,Great story!,"I have read many of Maeve Binchy's novels and am always inspired at her amazing ability to weave a story that involves many different characters, their lives, and their personalities in such a real and thought-provoking way. She is an amazing storyteller!"
2,This was a drag at times,"This book had so many characters, some interesting, some not. I enjoyed reading about Fiona, Lou & Connie & but not Signora or Laddy. Signora's story was extremely long & boring. The idea that Aidan can be satisfied with the creation of this Italian evening class instead of getting the principal position is absurd. There's a HUGE difference between being responsible (principal) for a school & being responsible for setting up ONE night class (Aidan)that meets 2days a week. I didn't think the ending was great either."
5,"She writes about ordianry people, with simple plot, but real","Again, again, and again Maeve Binchy has keep me sitting reading her books for hours. If you are a type of person who doesn't have much time I suggest you not to read Maeve Binchy's books, because once you get hold of it you will never put it down. In her latest she has again succesfully mesmerize me, I read it from cover to cover in one night. Although it is already expected that she has ordinary people in her plot, she still amuzes her readers. What is scary about her books is that these things can happen in real life. If you wanna laugh, cry, have a little suspense, read her books. Maeve Binchy I don't easily cry, but you made me cry in the last part of the story when they all sang a song and had tears in their eyes."
1,Wrong product description,The item description was for audio cd's and I received cassette tapes and had no way of listening to them. Something needs to be done about matching the item to its posted description before mailing.
3,"not satisfactory,but i've seen worse...","when i bought this book,i was filled with anticipation,but i was disappointed later on. it had so many characters that you'd probably need a list of them, and the whole plot was sort of out of reality. i mean, endless happy endings,almost everyone gets out of their former depressing life... but,it was pretty good,too. the taste of real life here and there, and in a way it was heart-touching;giving us the lesson of love."
3,"Priced right, but leaves a lot to be desired","While attractive in appearance, this leather case has one fatal flaw; the magnetic ""snap"" closure is all but useless, coming open at the slightest touch. Since there is currently no real alternative, I can recommend this product as long as the price stays (where it is). However, I expect this model will disappear from the market as soon as other manufacturers catch up to the needs of Jornada 720 users."
5,Very pleased,"I had read all the books in the Joe Grey series except for ""Cat Raise the Dead"" and couldn't find the title anywhere, not even at my local library. I decided to try Amazon and was pleased to find the title I needed. Thank you."
5,Cat Raise the Dead,"I highly recommend this book. It is interesting, keeps your attention, and you can't put it down. I am reading it again."
1,What kind of sick mind wrote this garbage????,"I was shocked and dismayed when I read this book. I have read several of SRM's books and enjoyed them tremendously. How could any author, who writes about talking cats, clearly targeting animal loving readers, think it would be a good idea to REPEATEDLY include graphic, sadistic, lengthy descriptions of cute, furry, innocent rabbits being terrorized, mutilated, tortured and devoured with glee by her main chacters??? And, as further insult to animal lovers everywhere, harp on it throughout the book??? I can't imagine WHAT SRM was thinking...oh, wait...SHE WASN""T!!!! Maybe she let a cat write this book, except a cat would have likely produced a better product. HATED IT, LOATHED IT, DESPISED IT! I may never read her work again.j"
3,Engaging read,"As a cat lover and a lover of mystery novels, I'll read anything that combines these two fascinations. This is the first book in the Joe and Dulcie series that I have read. However, the cat sleuth theme is not handled as convincingly here as in stories written by, for example, Lilian Jackson Braun and Rita Mae Brown. While I can suspend disbelief and accept that cats may communicate non-verbally with their owners, or with each other, I was not able to suspend my disbelief and accept that two cats can speak and read English. Nevertheless this is an engaging, rainy-day read."
5,Sand Pirates pulls you in to the story and won't let you go.,"Sand Pirates is not only a romance, it's a breezy mix of suspense, mystery and thrills beyond ones wildest dreams. It takes you far away to a land of fantasy. I was intrigued by the characters that were well developed and interesting. The story moves fast and keeps the blood pumping. The twist and turns of the plot and the island of Sava made me feel as if I were there.by- Kim Sandford author of Secret Fears"
4,Thoughtfully crafted examination,"Shelly Zegart has a deep and abiding passion for quilts and it shows. With her series Why Quilts Matter, Zegart delivers a thoughtfully crafted and insightful examination of the history, community and scholarship of the American quilt. This series could just as easily serve as a primer on the subject as it could springboard detailed and layered discussions deconstructing and analyzing the aesthetics and politics of the American quilt. I would recommend this series for both academic and public library collections."
5,Well done and informative,"This series does a wonderful job of covering all aspects of quilting. It was well-edited, and the supporting documentation available from the project enhance its value. Highly recommended."
1,A grim overview of quilts,"Shelly Zebart has as much business being in front of the camera as a tree. Her appearance, presentation and delivery are gruesome. She is matched by most of the other tedious, pompous, self-important people who populate this series.I have been quilting for over 30 years. I was looking forward to this program, and I was horrendously disappointed. The film is grinding, ponderous, gritty and just plain sad. The producer has managed to drain all of the fun out of quilts and quilting.If North Korea produced a documentary about quilting, this would be it."
2,Mixed blessing,"Very tight. I stripped out the padding and replaced it with headliner material to get a Canon XS and strap in it.The picture that I saw with an SLR and a spare lens must have been a mirage.The belt material is too slippery for the buckle. It was constantly loosening and almost got dropped. It had to be sewed.I am not happy with it, but have to live with it, having found no alternative."
4,Great Stuff,"I am using it for more than 6 months. Have to admit its a great one, preety tough, very well designed and easy to use.Not that of a good option in rain though. It is not a water resistant case, although it can take little rain without any issue."
3,Tight Fit,"I bought the pack to use with a Nikon D50 and a medium size lens. It works, but is a tight fit. I had to modify the padding to make it work. Otherwise, I was pleased with the quality and workmanship."
3,Small But Mighty,"I bought this to house my Canon XT for hiking trips and short distance travel. While it held the camera well, and protected it from the elements, its small-size made it hard to physically fit the camera in the bag.I then broke my Canon XT and purchased the newer Canon 60D, which is a much larger camera. Sadly, it doesn't fit very well in this bag. The bag is too small to accommodate storing both a body and a lens in this case.So if your camera is small, I highly recommend this product because Kata makes some very fine bags. But if you have a modern DSLR, it most likely will not easily fit in this bag.-Joey's Reviews"
5,My 18 month LOVES Lori!!!,"This is our second CD. The first one being the ""Best Of"". I tried to make the second purchase to have as few repeats as possible and songs that I thought my daughter would love. She simply can't get enough of Lori and honestly, I don't mind listening to it. We make up silly dances as well as sing along in the car. A must if you have a toddler!"
5,Perhaps Laurie Berkner's Best Album Yet!,"We are big fans of Laurie Berkner's entertaining lyrics and folk-singer musical style in our house. Under the Shady Tree is probably her best album to date. She varies slower, quieter songs with fast, jumpy songs. Her lyrics continue to be amusing and clever so mom and dad are happy to listen to her again and again and again and again.... If you are buying just one Laurie Berkner album, this is the one to get. (But it is better to own all 4!)"
5,Really Great Music for Everyone,"I am so happy to have discovered Laurie Berkner! This is made for kids but--it is SMART, SOPHISTICATED, QUALITY kid's music. My daughter and I love this mostly up-beating easy listening CD. The songs are very well written and performed. Berkner's positive and well-adjusted attitude really shines through in her lyrics. This is a delightful collection of songs that both child and parent can enjoy together. It just feels good!"
5,Keeps My Three-Year Old Happy in the Car,"After seeing Laurie on Noggin, we were hooked on her catchy tunes with positive messages. Her music has a great sound combined with fun lyrics for the kids. A huge smile comes across our son's face EVERY time he hears ""I'm Gonna Catch You."" I highly recommend this CD to anyone with kids. In the house, you'll dance and sing along. In the car, you'll bop along like you did before you had kids."
2,Boring!,"I'm sorry! I would love to leave a glowing review about this cd but I just can't! As a new fan of Laurie and friends, I just purchased her DVD and loved every song on it! Since the music cd that came with it only has a few songs on it, I thought I'd purchase this one (based upon 5 star reviews) and was sorely disappointed! No where on this cd is the energy and upbeat tempo that comes with her newer songs. It's more, slow,hippie, folks-y kinda music that my daughter couldn't even dance to! Granted, ""I'm gonna catch you"" is on it as well as ""Song on my Tummy"" and ""Who's That"" which are upbeat, happy songs, but I really find that most of these songs are played on the ""Low chord"" side which to me is kinda dark (Do the Dragon) for example. Not at all a favorite of mine and I will be taking it back. My advice to you is to listen to the clips provided on this site before you purchase. You may like them! Other than the three I listed, I don't."
2,DISAPPOINTED,Not up to the standard of Laurie Berkner's previous CD's. Skip this one and buy any of the other ones.
1,Got a wrong CD!!!!,"Just got the order of the CD from Amazon. Both the cover of the case and the cover of the CD is right: Under a Shady Tree. However, when we listen to it, it is totally different songs from different language!!! What the hell can that happen?! I don't even know if we can return it: since it is opened! But it is totally wrong songs!!! Could somebody help me here? How to contact Amazon? Thank you!!!"
1,What I feared about music when we had kids,"We'd heard so much abut Laurie Berkner's music when we had our first child. Our fears of what kids music would be were assuaged by many friends, and Laurie Berkner seemed held aloft as the torch-bearer for all that is good for kid and parent. Then we heard the music. It's the same shallow-melodied, clumsily phrased stuff that we remember from our youth, only worse. Even our 18 month old, who loves almost all music, gets bored in a nano-second when the songs start playing. We'll be sticking to The Beatles, They Might Be Giants, Prince, Arling & Cameron and our own guitars for a long while."
5,My 4 year old loves it!,"I bought this CD mainly to get free shipping and knew that it had song in my tummy on it. My 4 year old son has not stopped listening to it since we got it (and his baby sister smiles when she hears it too), he sings along to every song (especially drive my car) and even sings the songs without the CD on. It is pleasent and fun listening for the parents as well. Go for it."
5,Great for Kids!,My daughter loves this CD the only problem is that the songs are cute and stick in your head all day long.I would recommend this CD - it's a lot of fun to sing along with my daughter.
5,"like spinach to a child, so good for you, so hard to read","The most comprehensive system to understanding the physical world, from kindergarteners who are able to understand nuclear level inter-transformations, to adults who barely know what happens to a sphere when it's bounced on the ground; this book will enlighten you to some new inter/outer working combination you never thought of EVERY time you open it. I suggest a light pass, a medium pass, and a heavy pass in that order, just to shock you as to the amount of substance this book has, you will not walk away the same."
5,Go Bucks!,"What better way to support the Buckeyes than wearing this ""Fear the Vest"" shirt! Top quality shirt with lifelike features of OSU coach Tressel's gamewear. Any OSU fan would love this as a gift--my wife did!"
3,More Like 7x7 = Toy Size,"First, quality is fine - better than expected. The finish and connectivity of the poles has certainly been improved since the last one I ordered. Super tight top is still a feature, which is important for the occasional rain. These are the only arbors I've had that can handle the occasional storm without the covers collecting water, and we use then for garden canopies.But it's tiny. The so-called 10x10 measurement is a mystery, with the legs spread I get 9.5x9.5 and top where you expect the coverage is a merely 7x7. It looks like a toy arbor for kids. The people they show sitting inside in the picture must be wee little people - very misleading. Unless you need a small, toy-like arbor you'll have to find bigger, a real 10x10 or 12x12."
3,Worth the money,"Quick delivery.Directions were clear & easy 45 minutes to put up with one person, light weight material stands up in light rain & wind. Poles and cover are very light weight, sping retention. Worth the money for short nice weather camping or picnic shelter."
1,NOT 10 x 10 AT ALL!,NOT 10 x 10 AT ALL! Shy of 10 Feet on every side by 1 Foot! Poles are flimsey!Green is not ONLY green-has two green and two white top panels.Really was looking for ALL green! Misleading.
5,A pageturner,My husband couldn't put the book down--read it in 3 days. A friend he lent it to says it's excellent.
4,Tom Clancy without all the unnecessary pages,"This one fits the mode of military operations with political intrigue on the presidential level, a la Clancy, but the focus is really on the military operation and the team of Marines. It is a good book, a very good book. I take it from the author's Vietnam and Pentagon background that the way the Marines talk, fight, and deal with orders is realistic, and I found it very intersting. None of that secret, hush-hush stuff that fills Clancy and his wannabes pages. The characters are fun, not too deep, but you don't want them deep. The action is what moves this book along, but the undercurrent of heart and emotion that ran throughout my reading is what caught me by surprise. You start to really care for this group even though they're a modern military dynamo. A real keeper. Any ex-miltary personnel (note- I am not one of them) will flip for this book."
2,Disappointing,"I began writing book reviews recently and bought this book in order to educate myself and in order to learn how to write a quality book review. This book was not very helpful in this regard. I also purchased ""The Slippery Art of Book Reviewing"" and found it far more helpful."
1,Totally lame,"I did not enjoy this CD an all, and I usually love this kind of music. Not worth the money. Stay away. Ask your local music store for other suggestions."
2,Follow The River,It showed as a audio book which has alway been used on a CD player but this was a gift for a shut in who doesn't have a special player
5,Survival story,"I love survival stories, and this is one of the highest quality. Like what everyone else said, I couldn't put this book down. The descriptions were great, and I felt like I was traveling with them along the banks of the river. Mary Ingles, also rings strangely true, her character came across as different to me from so many other fictionalized characters, as more honest, human, like James Alexander Thom actually took some time to think about her and what she was actually like. I admire Mary's good cheer in the face of so many odds, and everything she did to get home. I also like the fact that this was actually a real person, and I felt like I had learned a small, valuable chip of our nation's history. The author should be congratulated, I'm definetely going to read more of his books."
2,Boring!,This is the most depressing and overly descriptive book I have read in a while. I kept waiting for something to change but it never did.
3,An OK book,"Surely not on my top 10 list, but I always like reading a ""true story"". Was kind of long and had to skim a little in the middle. It was interesting to see what these ladies would do to survive though and was very graphic. Was ok."
2,Follow the River,"Book was very old looking, pages turned dark beige. It was legible but not pleasant to read. It was evaluated as used-good. I would judge it to be fair condition or less."
3,Brutal,"Too brutal for me, whether real or not. American history, strength of a woman, but a little tedious and too brutal"
1,Ick.,"I know this is based on a true story but I couldn't get past the violence in the first 50 pages or so. It just seems to set the whole book up to be a conflict between the horrible Indians and the sainted pioneers. Yeah, and the reference to the hairy man in Mary's life was just...ick.The true details of Mary's story will never be known. What the author has created here is all speculation. Indians bad, pioneers good. Sorry, they were here first, we were just taking away their land and their game. (And you know what? They were right. And white people got to write the hostly books.) I would love to read the same story from the Indian's point of view.Too many adjectives and too much sensationalism ruin what could have been a pretty good story."
5,Follow the River,One of the most interesting books written in a long time. The way it was written you would think it was the person who all this happened to was writing a book. I have a very good library in my town so I rarely buy a book unless it is for a gift. I purchased this book because it is one I will reread often.
5,alm on Kindle,"A wonderful, exciting, excruciating, painful and hopeful tale. i didn't realize it was true until i finished it! Mary Ingles was and AMAZING woman! on kindle"
5,Love it,I read this about 20 years ago and I am returning to it. A wonderful story with Mary Ingles surviving capture from the Indians and her love of family. I would recomend this book.
5,this book was memerizing,"I can't say enough good things about this book, spellbounding, mesmerizing, I just couldn't put it down. This was one of my first kindle purchases and i would definitely buy a kindle book again. It is so convenient and since my phone goes everywhere with me I could read whenever I had the opportunity."
5,New fan,This was the first book by Thom that I read. I since read FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA and have ordered more of his books. History buffs will enjoy his style.
5,gripping,"The story was gripping without being too graphic. I enjoyed reading the story of his research at the end, also"
1,Not here,"I have never received this book. The seller sent me several emails stating that it was sent, but no tracking number was available. They said they would send a new one if I didn't receive it, but I haven't received that one either.Filed a claim with Amazon and haven't heard on that either. Not sure what to do now"
5,It's SOOO good you cannot believe it is true!!,"Everyone who likes non-fiction MUST read this book. I could not put it down. Your kids should read it to appreciate what the early settlers dealt with. This is an amazing adventure that leaves you thirsty to know more. There is a book shop by my home that always keep it in stock as a MUST READ. Also, this book is about a woman and her incredible journey. There are few books about women's adventure like this, but the story appeals to all."
5,I've read it twice and will probably read it again!,"I'm a fan of James Alexander Thom and have read most of his wonderful historical novels. This is my favorite. Can you imagine the pain and anguish Mary Ingalls and her family suffered? Can you feel the numbing cold and even more numbing hunger as she walks and crawls her way back home...following the river? The courage, strength and bone-basic will to survive described here are hard to imagine. Few would have survived this true-life ordeal and very few could bring this story to life as well as J.A. Thom does here."
3,Follow the River,I purchased this book as a gift for my mother. She said it was a very good book but some of the letters on the right-sided pages were cut off so she kind of had to guess at the words. Almost sent it back but didn't because she read it in a matter of a few days. But I'm sure it was a big aggravating at times!
2,Couldn't Read....,"Read about 25 pages of this book but could not get through it. It is definitely not for the squeamish. I skipped ahead and found out Mary had left her baby behind and the idea of a mother leaving her baby behind was disturbing. Also, the treatment of the captives was graphic so if the reader can get through this it could be a good read as other readers indicated. If you are not one for graphic and horrific desciptions you may want to skip this read...."
5,Enthralling.....Fascinating......A have to read,"Being a lover of history, this was definately a fabulous book. Sometimes writers try to sugar coat our country's history, as if it was a perfect time; But it was not! James Alexander Thom does not sugar coat the truth, which makes the story all the more better."
5,Nothing Better!!,"I read this book about once a year and am humbled each time. I recommend this book to anyone with a beating heart, you will love it."
4,"Heartfelt, wonderful book...","Captivating and well written, this book was extremely hard to put down once I picked it up. Centering on young wife and mother Mary Ingles, this book follows the story of her capture by the Indians, and subsequent trials as she attempts to find her way home. To give away more than that would be a terrible slight to this wonderful book; it's one you just gotta read.The author describes everything perfectly; with enough in depth language to really give a feel for what's going on, even the horrifying stuff; but not enough to really gross me out. The accents were a bit overdone, I thought; while they did add some authenticity that wouldn't have been there otherwise, it was awhile before I could puzzle out what anyone was saying. This book deals with some disturbing subject matter, such as infant murder and child abandonment, among others, so I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone younger than 15 or 16."
5,The best of the best...,"If you read only one book this year, them let it be ""Follow the River"" by James Alexander. Send the kids off to school and put the dog out, because you will not be able to put this book down. I love to read about history and this book has it all history,love, tears, and fear. I wish I could be just half the woman Mary was. Thought it all she keep the faith and the need to go home again. Please read this book and you will not be sorry...better yet BUY this book and read it over and over again like we all have....."
5,CAPTIVATING,"This book was impossible to put down....I felt the fear, the uncertainty, the tears and even at some points the laughter....A must read!!"
5,The best book for Objective-C programming,This book is the best one for novice objective-c programmers.
5,Impeccable work!,"I am a huge fan of Danielle Steel. I have been reading her books for 15 years now and I just finished up on called KALEIDOSCOPE. OMG, this is the best one I have read yet. Danielle Steel is a magical woman. I have never read anything so wonderful before. To me the characters are so real. In this book you laugh a lot and you cry and you get really angry. I could not put this book down. I read it in a week. I wish I could go into the book and meet the characters and live in their world. I am looking forward to reading more of Danielle's works."
4,Kaleidscope,"This is an amazing book! It was very addicting. It starts off kind of slow, but once you get pass the first few chapters you will just want to keep reading. I couldn't put the book down I had to find out what happens in the next chapter. A muxt ready you will be very pleased!!!"
1,should be no stars,Uninvolving and unbelievable (especially the ending). I've tried several of Steel's books so this isn't a single dud. She can't write to save her life.
4,Good book!!!,"What a beautiful story!!!! The tree sisters are separated after the death of their parents, and the only one who remembers anything is the oldest. The story tells of how Hillary gets her sisters back together after so many years apart."
1,not a winner,another book to add to your danielle steel pile of trash. i haven't been impressed with any of her books yet. what was up with all the rape scenes in the begginning of the book?
3,It is not my favorite,Danielle Steel is a wonderful author and I love her books. This one is just not one of my favorites!
2,Slow and Plodding,"I found this book to be slow and plodding. I really wanted to like it but had to force myself to finish it. I love reading pure history books which can be a bit dry, but when it comes to historical fiction I like more ""action"" with my history."
4,Don't want to end..,Severin knows his subject matter and more importantly is able to create believabl and moving characters that are aproduct of ther times and not creations that have been placed their from our own. Above all it makes me want to read the sequal which i am going to do. Enjoy...
4,Great Book,I look forward to the next installment of the series. I've read all of Tim's fictional works and really enjoy his stories.
4,Good read,"This was an enjoyable read - although a little short. It certainly is worth picking up as a way to spend a lazy afternoon. My only issue with this series (not any one book in particular) is that it kind of defies belief that this one person could have participated at so many key events across so much time and distance. However, if one suspends belief for that point, the story is enjoyable. The book is well written and it flows smoothly."
3,Slow to give birth,"A little slow and at time tedious, but none-the-less a reasonably good read. Since I purchased all three books in the trilogy, I am hopefull Kings Man moves a bit faster. I'll let you know."
5,AN ART NUVEAU FAIRY !!!,"This fairy is different from all the fairys I've seen out there. It has an Art Nuveau felling to it. Doesn't have a bail so you slide the necklace chain throughout its wings and it looks like she floats aroung your neck. It looks exactly like the picture, really pretty!"
5,Oven mitt,I have been looking for this mitt for along time. I like the fact that it is a mitt . I use it under hot dishes on the table as well.
1,Mighty Mouse VHS,"Thought there were four Mighty Mouse cartoons. Turns out to be one Mighty Mouse and three older cartoons without Mighty Mouse. Quality poor, EP mode. Not worth the few dollars spent."
1,deceptive trade practice,I did not receive the three rolls of hose that was discounted from $135.15 down to $1.59 a savings of $133.56.What I received was a 5' peice of hose.This is a deceptive trade practice that should not be allowed by Amazon and I fell that as a result of these practices by That Fish Place I should be fully refunded of all cost and That Fish Place should cover all shipping and handling for the return of the product orSEND ME WHAT I AGREED TO PURCHASE AND HAVE PAID FOR!Water Hose for Fluval 303 403 Filters - 14 mm
4,Another funny one from Sands ...,"This cute little romance reads quickly. It seemed the plot was Aric getting over his distrust & jealousy more than either of them being in danger. Lots to spice the storyline: her work with animals, everybody trying to keep Aric from flying into a rage, and debates over what sexual acts are sinful -- LS creates constant amusement for her readers."
5,Wicked cute!,"Another great book. Some giggles, some gasping, and some tears. It has all the elements of a great love story!"
4,Another winner!,"You've gotta love the lengths to which Rosamunde will go to not ""disobey"" her new husband. Being that ""to obey"" is a pretty important wedding vow, and we all know how men feel about being obeyed.....Once again Sands delivers a charming and bright story about two who go through some interesting changes in order to become one. Aric has just enough stubborness so that we're sure he's all man, but put the threat of being drawn and quartered on his plate and...... Well, he's no dummy. And what can we say about Rosamunde? Sweet, intelligient, easy to get along with, undercover rebel (that kinda thing happens when you're raised in a convent) and well schooled in the art of mating. Animal mating, that is. Makes for some interesting lovemaking, you think? Enough said about that.I don't know how Ms. Sands keeps coming up with these great stories; I'm just glad she does. It's always such a pleasure to be surprised, amused by and truly interested in the characters."
2,Simple and Average,"This story had some good laughs but other than that it was very average and simple. The first part started out very good and was promising, THEN, it became unexciting. The intimacy was well described but for some reason was boring after the second time. Maybe there wasn't enough chemistry depicted between Rosamunde and Aric and, therefore, the well described intimacy just wasn't moving to the reader. Story was just too much on the simple side.Very average."
3,Mei ruins it!!,"I mostly base my stars on the singing. I can tolerate a lot if the singing is good. Mei is totally wrong for this role. Her singing is very poor. She must have practiced a lot for the last scene as she was more together vocally there. Still, nothing about the way she acts or looks or sings evokes any sensuality. In fact, very much a turn off. I guess that's why our stage director shows so much nudity, to try to get some sexual feeling to the audience.I always thought Dessay would be perfect in this role with her ethereal singing and heart wrenching acting. The perfect, fragile victim for AthanelIf you can stand Mei its an interesting, often very pleasing production to watch. Me??? I went back to the Kirsten/Merrill duet to recover."
2,Not An Original HP Product (HP C4150A),"Ordered this product thinking I would be getting and OEM HP C4150A Cyan cartridge. It is not OEM but an alternate cartridge manufactured for Universal Brand (P/N UNV 83150) by some unknown manufacturer (it is not noted on box or instructions who makes it.) Although the cartridge looks fine and does not appear to be a refill I am uncertain of the pedigree. It may be fine or it may not work out. Time will tell. Hope the description of the cartridge under the seller ""Restock It"" gets changed so the buyer knows exactly what they are getting."
4,"Great product, for a greater price","This is a nice add-on to your PS2, is really cheap and it works really nice, i have a lot of fun playing with, i have been able to make my mon and even my dad to dance with this.You can beat this for the price."
2,Lousy dance pads,"I bought the game and the dance pads after playing it at a friends house. These were inferior quality pads, compared to the ones my friend owned. I slipped all over the place and couldn't feel where on the pad my feet were. Fun game... but don't buy these pads."
3,Not up to par,"The company only sent one dance pad even though it was supposed to be a combo pack, but they sent me the other one after I wrote to them explaining that only one had arrived. Then, a few days later, one of the dance pads started malfunctioning, but I don't blame the company for that."
4,"Great game, but the mats curl","The game is fantastic but the mats themselves should only be purchased by the casual player. We've had trouble with the mats curling upwards and the sensors migrating, which can cause missteps even when the player actually got the step perfectly. Very annoying on Dance Master mode! We remedied the problem by weighting the corners down with hand weights and storing them flat but it's a bit of a pain in the butt to keep them like that, especially since we sometimes play more than once a day. Other than that, these mats are just fine!"
4,great fun!,"Both our kids (11 and 15 years old) enjoy this. Even for my husband and me, it is a fun exercise game. You get to sweat in no time but not feel the bore of run or walk. Because you want to get a better score and to the next level, you keep trying. The only draw back is that after a month of usage, one of the pad doesn't respond well."
1,shouldn't have buy it,"The kid were so happy when we got it. After we plugged it in and start to dance the mat just go all over the floor, we try to put that sticky pad we use under the rug and it still moving around. Now it's in the corner no one want to use it, since it's too late to return..sorry to say, it is a piece of junk..waste money only"
3,DDR Player - yay,This game has some pretty good songs but it seems like an older version. I think a lot more could have been done with the graphics. It really sucks that a lot of the good songs don't even play all the way through. It was worth the $10 bucks I payed but I definitely have more fun playing the newer versions at the arcade.
4,Great Product!,Was shipped fast! Product is just as expected! I use the dance pad just about every day. Just remember not to crease them or the arrows will work funny!
3,Fun? Yes. Good deal? Hmm...,"For what it is, it is a very good deal. Both pads are exactly as they have been marketed, and work with the PS2 and DDR games. Although I do think this is a good and fun way to play DDR and/or lose weight, keep in mind that the button which correspond to the arrows slide around inside the pad, making it difficult to play with after a while.Mine have already begun to have this problem, and I bought it less than a month ago, playing it four times a week, two hours everyday.So, as a beginner, it's a good deal, but if you have a little more experience under your belt and want to practice DDR hard-core, I suggest investing your money in the Red Octant 2.0 or something similar."
2,Cheap Pads,"I love DDR, and I have been playing for a few years now. These pads were sold for a pretty good price, they shipped fast, and I received them within a few days of my order (which is the only reason why I gave them a two star rating). I took VERY good care of the pads, but within two days of playing with a friend, the up button on one of the pads broke (when he stood in the center of the pad it used the up button which gets VERY annoying). We play on heavy mode, but we DO NOT stomp on the pads. They just weren't made very well at all. They slide all over the place too. After about a week, it seems as if the pads are almost completely broken. DDR is an amazing game, but I suggest that you shell out more money and get better pads."
4,.,"the pad was good, but very light, so it ended to slide around on both carpet and tile floor. also, the corners would warp upwards, making it hard to hit some of the buttons. it's cheap, so what would you expect?"
5,"FANTASTIC DVD !!! THE ""LOST OUTLAW CONCERT"" IS HERE !!!","I already had the 1 hour WAYLON JENNINGS documentary, but the expanded running time on this DVD caught my eye, so I took a chance and ordered it. I'm so grateful that I did, because the bonus feature here is ""THE LOST OUTLAW PERFORMANCE"". I've been waiting and hoping for this great concert video to come out on DVD. It's a complete Waylon show from 1978 at the Grand Ole Opry !! Waylon is at his peak in this performance, and the show's songlist is a fan's dream come true !! There are no cutaways, no interviews, no annoying distractions - just a superb concert by a legend!! It's on this DVD, complete and in beautiful sound and picture quality !!"
2,Bummer,We purchased this to HEAR Waylon sing and see his performance. Instead we got 90% tiresome interviews. Too bad.
2,Hot Wire Replacements,"Hot Wire Replacements without the connectors...get real. I ordered replacements for an Uchida Hot Wire Foam Cutter, but they came w/out the end connectores .Again not worth the money!"
3,Cuts poorly.,Don't expect the foam to evaporate in a puff of smoke before this cutting wire! You have to drag it through with an effort. In general the device is underpowered and the wire tends to break because of the effort required.
5,It Works Well,I used this wire to create my own hot wire foam cutter. I am using a train transformer as the power supply. Results have been good in my initial trials.
3,Bruce Lee style! funny,"When two Hong Kong buddies become rivals for the same woman, their friendship ends, and they join rival tong gangs. Later, a tong boss cleverly conspires to use a motion picture company to cover illegal drug trafficking: Actresses are sent to Amsterdam for film roles not realizing that they carry cocaine shipments. Once in Holland, the actresses are sold into prostitution. Soon the faux film company shanghais the woman who put the two friends at odds. To save their beautiful damsel, the two ex-buddies must join forces and go on the offense."
2,When size matters...,"When I recived the Sumdex ""travel"" wallet I decided to return it that same day. The wallet, depite how it looks in the picture, is *huge*. I was hoping for something that would fit in the purse I currently carry, and this doesn't. The PDA slot is big enough for almost two, it's stiff, and just plain large. Look for something else unless you are looking for a purse replacement."
1,Not a wallet!,"Don't be deceived by the name. This is not a wallet -- it's a purse. In fact, it's bigger than my purse! The compartment for the PDA is much bigger than a Palm device, so if that's all you have, expect it to slide around. It's also quite thick. The leather is not high grade, although within acceptable limits, and is stiff.Buy this if you want a not-fancy, hold-it-all purse. Don't buy it if you wanted something that held just a bit more than the slim palm wallets."
2,Be Aware of What You're Getting Here! And NOT Getting...,"The main point about this book is that it is not really a book at all! It consists of about 40 pages of short chapters on various aspects of handguns, followed by about 150 pages of product listings taken pretty much entirely from the analogous sections of Gun Digest-that is, pictures of handguns with brief specifications and a list of prices. If you are interested in 40 pages of VERY elementary articles on handguns, this might be the book for you. For the rest of the book, you'd do better to get the most recent Gun Digest from your local library."
5,"Great watch, accurate and tough","I have owned this watch, with black face and titanium band, for almost four years. It is the best watch I've ever had, including the Seikos and Pulsars and Wengers. They are all good timepieces, and frankly more elegant, but for daily wear the Momemntum outshines them all.Very accurate and durable, I have done sports wearing the Momentum ranging from sea sports to shooting sports to aviation and a lot in between. Not a hiccup from the watch. The crystal is particuarly admirable. It's had and tough and even after these years and activities, not a scratch on it.Only problem - the clasp of the band is now loose and sometimes opens itself for no apparent reason. I guess I'll send it back for a service, but definitely it's a keeper.These watches have risen a great deal in price since I bought mine (I paid $120) but even so, knowing what I know now, I still think they are more than worth the money."
3,not so bad,"I purchased that to my daughter, 9years old, and I can say this is a very good, fantastic metal cover for her fragil ipod, BUT when you put the ipod inside the jacket you loose your ""necklace"" (because the ipod's bottom must goes out). I'm also concern about the ipod ""USB connection"" is exposed (the jacket's bottom is opened-I just dont know why!!)."
3,Always Wait For New Hitchcock,"So glad to have a new Robyn Hitchcock recording. Especially one that bears resemblance to an actual pop/rock record. It sounds good and it sounds like Robyn. It is enjoyable. But it lacks any real ""drop your jaw"" tracks and doesn't rank among his top LPs.(To me.) I hope he will continue to mix his acoustic and electric material in the future and continue to make new music. Ole Tarantula confirms there is plenty left in the tank. Now Robyn,let's fill 'er up and actually GO somewhere."
4,"Old dogs, new tricks, etc.","Probably the most energetic album in a decade from this prolific songwriter whom I will not hesitate to call a genius. That energy no doubt is due to the presence of longtime pals Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey, among others, who bring the Rock to Hitchcock's game. As a result, songs like ""Adventure Rocketship,"" and ""Ole Tarantula"" take us back to the Soft Boys universe. ""Belltown Ramble"" is a guided tour through a typically Hitchcockian landscape that is somewhere between the steppes of Uzbekistan and the streets of San Francisco. Fans who lost interest in his work after the Egyptians broke up will find much to enjoy here."
1,NOT GOOD,Dud Album. The sound was tinny and whiny. I tried to like this artist. Some compared him to Lennon......DREAM ON.Gave my copy to Goodwill. Just aint my scene. I tried.
4,Robyn Hitchcock's most obscene album yet,"Robyn repeats the F-word several times during the song The Authority Box. If this is the type of thing that you enjoy, then you might enjoy this album. I'm not offended by obscene language, but I'm not impressed by it either. Previously, Robyn never used foul language in his songs. I guess now he is trying to appeal to a younger, more foul mouthed audience. If so, he should've titled the album Hella F'n Tarantula.Robyn's lyrics have always been subjective, so you probably won't agree with my assessment. But to me, his last several albums have been attempts to rationalize terrible behavior. He seems to be refusing to stand up for what is right, and is trying to argue that it's okay to not stand up for what is right.Nevertheless, this is a pretty good album. So I have to give it a four star rating."
3,So-so Robyn,"Has its moments, but not up to snuff with earlier works. For anyone not overly familiar with RH; just get his greatest hits album. This is a superb sample of his work and has 10-12 shining nuggets that won't leave your head. As for this release the first half is quite strong; Underground Sun is my favorite. However, I am hard pressed to recommend anything after song 6."
2,It covers,"The only thing this pool table cover does is cover the pool table. It is however, not strong enough to last any length of time if you take it off and put it on frequently. It rips very easily, so I give it 2 stars only because it does fit and covers the pool table nicely."
5,A Great Cover for the Price,"Looks good, was well priced, and does its job. You can't ask for more than that."
2,Destroyed in days by the cat,"This product would probably work well if you have no pets, but our cat completely tore this up within a couple of days."
2,Does the job.,"I am updating this review. It lasted about a year then started tearing. It is a cheap cover, so if that is your goal, it is perfect. I recently bought a nice leather one.For the money this cover does the job. Only thing I don't care for is the color. It is a turquoise green and it kind of clashes with the green cloth of the table itself. I would have preferred a grey or black cover. It looks a little wrinkled also but smooths out a little with use."
1,Broke under light use in less than 6 months.,"At first this scale looks like its build with a lot of quality craftsmanship. Then after 6 months with light use (I'm 180lbs and girlfriend is 130lbs) it suddenly stops working. The exterior seems to have a heavy steel frame, but the area with the weight dial (w/ numbers) and the arm that gives you the weight reading must have cost about $.10. It seems that the weight is written on a piece of card paper or plastic. It just came out of its setting and the arm doesnt move anymore. I couldn't figure out how to open it up and fix it either. This scale is not worth the money and completely misrepresented as ""quality"". I'll never buy Taylor again.Additional Information: I emailed Taylor about warranty information and they will replace the scale free of charge without a receipt. They only require you to ship your broken scale to them, which isnt cheap. At least they stand by their product even though mine broke so easily."
1,worked for a few months,"felt like it was a strong product, well built, but after 6 months or so, arm that pointed to weight came loose and did not turn anymore. very light use, maybe checked weight once a week."
5,cute cute cute,"Got this doll as a christmas present for my four year old.....love it! I also purchased the giraffe carrier and the changing pad/diaperbag, well worth the extra. I tested everything before giving it to my little girl and I hated having to put that doll back in the box til christmas morn! What a fun little baby...sweet and just interactive enough to be entertaining without getting too high tech. I really recommend this baby."
2,Not very educational !!,"I got this oy for my daughter thinking she will learn something from the toy and also spend some time. However, I was not very impressed by the toy, because it is not an educational toy. My daughter also tossed it away. I am very disappointed.."
1,Filler & not Widescreen,"First off, this is a filler arc that isn't worth buying seeing how it does not even slightly contribute tot he over all story like the Bount arc. Also, this set is not in widescreen. These episodes originally aired in 16:9 in japan and were cut down to 4:3 for Adult Swim. When the box said uncut and orignal, they must be referring to the Adult Swim tv releases and not the actual orignal episodes.In addition to all that, there's nothing special to the box, not even a cardboard sleeve."
2,Filler Box Set,"Skip this boxset.I own every boxset and movie except for this one and Fade to Black.Honestly, try and find the few episodes related to the Souske Aizen story line on the begging of this set on Adult Swim.The episodes about Youricio are stupid and boring. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.If Viz would make the boxset 5-6 discs long like they used to for about 40$, then it wouldn't be bad. But this is just stealing your money."
4,Mixed Feelings but It's still BLEACH!,"When i first bought this set i was expecting to see what happens after the battle of Ichigo and Grimmjow but oddly enough the episode started with a different story line. Its about a rich girl Rurichiyo that comes in the world of the living with her two bodyguards and are being chased by a group of assassins. Now Ichigo and Rukia have to protect this girl.The first 2 discs are just plain talk and the background of Rurichiyo but Bleach shines on episode 175 and disc 4 where Uryu, Chad, Ichigo and Rukia are challenged by the group of assassins that are after the noble girl. Fights are pretty good with lots of action.So if you are a true fan of Bleach you won't miss this set. It's not on the same level as the Arrancar Arc but it's still BLEACH!"
5,Bleach Uncut Box Set 11,Bleach Uncut Box Set 11; A continuation in the series and a wonderful addition to my sons Bleach video library. I just wish they would release the seasons a little more timely
5,My Hopes for the awesome title,Firstly I hope this release is as awesome as all the others.And secondly I hope that Viz releases this with the same high picture quality I always get from them.hope everyone buys this it holds many a great episode....
2,Fair Warning,"I suppose that, from a purely artistic/stylistic point of view, I can see why people like this movie, but the one thing that really struck me about ""Audition"" is the amount of graphic brutality and sadistic violence. If you don't mind seeing a movie where people have limbs severed, eyeballs stabbed with long, sharp pins, etc. then, by all means, watch this movie. For myself, however, it was way too much. Way, way too much.Is it an artistic accomplishment to make the audience so uncomfortable? Perhaps. Certainly the makers of American horror films don't seem able to do it. ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was a light-hearted romp compared to ""Audition.""Personally, however, I wish I hadn't seen it. There's nothing positive or thought-provoking that this movie leaves you with... just a lot of images that will make you squirm uncomfortably as you watch it."
4,A good package deal for the avg user,"You really cant beat the price considering it is everything you need to get going with digital pictures. The memory card included is a great feature! The camera and printer are both very easy to use. Being able to print straight to the printer without a computer is very nice! If you are a basic user and want goo quality pics, check this one out!"
4,Wanted: More John Miles.,"For those that don't have turntables anymore, this is about the only thing by John Miles you can get on CD. This and his first album ""Rebel"". Will the powers that be ever re-release his best albums ""Zaragon"" and ""More Miles Per Hour""? Meanwhile, my 20 year old tape of these two albums just broke. I need to find someone with an operational turntable who can re-record my vinyl copies for me."
2,CASIO PC unite experiences,"I found this product to be useful but not reliable enough to take on overseas trips away from the computer that loads it. Every six months or so it spontaneously reboots or ""hangs"" depite sending back to local agent. This can be quite annoying. This manufacturer has a very nice idea that I like and I look forward to a new model as I cant live without a wrist reminder but it should be more stable than this version."
3,Could be better,"Although a PIM in a watch is a great idea, the Casio one is less than full featured. Another product, the OnHandPC from Mitsucom, has many more features. However, if you just need a basic calendar and address book on your wrist, this is a great product."
3,Not intended for highschool kids,"Jules Roy ""Battle of Dienbienphu"" reaccounts the French's flaw and soon after defeat of the Vietminh. Though wordly and confusing at times, it seemed that Roy nailed all spots in historical context and the emotions released by Navarre as well as the communist Giap. As a Vietnamese H.S. student it seems that this book is for those who want to relieve the battle through the heroism as well as its saddened defeat."
5,WW2 from a different POV,"This novel brings up so many new aspects of the WW2 experience. The perspective of Indians and ethnic Brits, the issue of interracial relationships during the war, the political implications of the use and sacrifice of agents. I felt that Baldwin's descriptions made me feel I was right there on the scene. The structure of the book kept my emotions at high pitch. Not an easy novel to read, I had to at times, put it down for several days to get away from the incidents described. The scenes of Noor in jail were heart breaking. And I'm so pleased that the author resisted the Hollywood ending to the story. I read this book a year ago and it's still with me. Fabulous read."
3,Second Favorite Baldwin Novel,"If you like this book, you'll LOVE Baldwin's earlier novel, ""What the Body Remembers"".The Tiger Claw has the author's characteristic emotional sensitivity and poise, and is a very satisfying read. If it were the first Baldwin novel I was reading, I would probably give it more than 3 stars. However, her earlier work - What the Body Remembers is just SO much better, that I couldn't help feeling somewhat disappointed with this book."
4,Good. Not the best grip.,Good picks. they are .96 mm which is not in the discription. they are sturdy but yet they have a little bit of flex to them which is pretty nice for electric playing. The only complaint i have is that grip is not the best. it's not too bad but when you play for a little bit and your fingers get a little moist from sweat then it might get a little slippery.
2,The worst bi-lingual dictionary I have ever used.,"Probably the worst language dictionary I have used so far.I am attempting to learn my 2nd asian language and find this dictionary to be of almost no value whatsoever.I have some major issues with this book:1) For starters, there are no ""Chinese"" characters in the book, making it nearly impossible to truly learn the language.2) The publisher of this dictionary claims to have ""15,000 of the most popular words and phrases"", yet a majority of the words are obscure deriviatives of common words or will never come up in daily conversation.- For example, how often have you used the following words: ""Cogent"",""Elf Land"",""Quayage"", or ""Trepang""???3) Worst of all, there are various spelling errors in both the English and Cantonese languages.Not a bad reference, but not very useful for the beginner."
3,half way there!,"The dictionary is a great step for learners of Cantonese. However, what would help would be separating each word so for each word it is not a complete string of roman letters. For example, the word ""computer"" is two characters in Cantonese but would appear as ""xyzasb"" in the dictionary. Chinese is character based so separating the pin yin words would greatly help. Using the same example, then this would be ""xyz abc"". Furthermore, why not just throw in the Chinese characters to make the dictionary complete and appeal to all levels of competency and learning styles?"
3,An unchallenging cozy read,"Based on the rather sloppy writing, I thought it would be a lot worse, but it was cute and, as they say, ""cozy."" True to the show in that respect, I suppose, though not terribly clever or challenging. Nice though.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
2,Big Disappointment,"I have read several of the other ""Murder She Wrote"" books by Donald Bain, and I must say that this was the worst. There are so many inaccuracies in descriptions. For instance the so-called Indian food that Jessica's friends prepared is actually Middle eastern/Moroccan/Greek. Information like this is very easy to verify. Just go to an Indian restaurant and look at a menu or do a Google search.Jessica is also a big busybody in this one. She sticks her nose where it has no business being. The murderer makes no sense or at least how Jessica arrives to that conclusion is implausible.I loved the television series. It was one hour of relaxation after a hard day of studying. The books, on the other hand, disappoint. Give me Miss Marple any day. I realize that these books cannot be compared to real mystery novels, but a little more attention to detail would be appreciated."
2,A Little Yuletide Boredom,"I have read almost all the Jessica Fletcher-Donald Bain ""Murder She Wrote"" mysteries. Of all of them thus far, I have found this one the most boring. I was looking forward to a Christmas mystery set in Cabot Cove, but found this one not up to the usual standards. The characters (apart from the continuing ones-- Jessica, Mort, Seth) are not interesting or original. It's a ""darker"" mystery than some of the others."
4,Who killed Cabot Cove's Santa?,"Christmastime in Cabot Cove and time for the annual Christmas Festival. But where's Santa? Why, he's been shot dead out on the farm! And Jessica (J.B.) Fletcher is on the case. This continuation of Cabot Cove capers is a comfortable visit with old friends.The ""Murder, She Wrote"" book series is ""based on the Universal television series"" ostensibly written in the 1st person by Jessica Fletcher, with a little help from Donald Bain. This series could have been just an effortless knock-off capitalizing on the TV show - but it is, actually, quite good and could be a standout stand alone series of its own. More's the better that it offers the opportunity to continue the Cabot Cove characters we've come to cherish on TV.It's a (quaint little cozy and) Wonderful Life! (and death.) /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer."
4,Okay.,"Jessica is finally back in Cabot Cove for Christmas. Every year an annual Christmas festival is held, and the santa clause is played a local called Rory Brent.But when Rory is found murdered, the whole town goes into a state of shock. Who could do this to such a sweet man? But when Jessica does some investigating of her own, some of Rory's dark secrets are revealed. Will Jessica solve the murder before Christmas?While this is an okay book, the plot can move some-what slow. You do not want to read this if you are new to the series. But to a old fan, I can reccomend this."
5,barnyard a learning lesson for all ages,"the music is awsome, the storyline is great I love how they tell a story on how one should be in life, I love this movie I can watch again and again if you are one that love animation and love a feel good story then this movie is for you."
3,Barnyard,I was fun for the kids to watch. Watched it twice and the artists did a beautiful job. I enjoyed it.
4,Barnyard,I really liked the movie - I just wish there would have been some indication that a death scene would be present - I made my nieces cry.
5,Super funny,My whole family loves this movie. I am a movie snob and don't easily sit down to watch a movie because I don't appreciated the rude humor in most kids movies. I found this movie so funny for our whole family. It is a must buy for good laughs!
5,A hilarious movie that speaks the truth!,"I first saw Barnyard when it came out back in 2006, and thought it was super funny! The humor might be dry to some, but that's the beauty of it. Ignore the males with the udders, though. Also, it's from the creators of Jimmy Neutron! If you love(d) Jimmy Neutron or animals, watch Barnyard: The Original Party Animals! You'll laugh from beginning to end."
3,Udderly distracting!,"Like many of the other critics, the good fun in this movie is a bit overshadowed by the ""guy cows with udders"". Of course, I do have to agree that real bulls standing up would have been just as, if not more, objectionable......! It is still a very funny movie but parents, don't be surprised when your kid, upon seeing a cow - with udders - in the field, ask you ""Is it a mama cow or a daddy cow?"
1,Third Gender Cows,"Anthropomorphisation is only funny to a certain extent and when an animal's original character is preserved. In this movie, you see some mutants that you can't even guess what they are (neither from their appearance nor from their behavior). A good animated movie about animal life (e.g. Over The Hedge, Ice Age, etc.) involves thorough observation of fauna prior to attempts of recreating it on screen. Poor, poor plot line."
1,this movie is terrible,this movie is the worts movie ever made. very boring.and the jokes doesn't meke sense.it is so forced.
2,it was ok,"the captions,picture quality&Direction were cool,but where was the actual story? I caught this film recently&it took well to the film was almost over to figure out just what was meant to be within the context of the film. the voices were alright,but this film felt like a film without actually being a film about anything. just kinda there."
5,Barnyard,"Great animation & subject matter. The big screen is getting flooded with really good animations. Many have weak story lines but this one has a ""purposeful"" story behind it, reminding us to look at our own lives and how we live them."
3,For Younger Children,"I wasn't all that impressed with this one. It lacks detailing to make the plot worthwhile, kind of skims over things. It's geared more for toddlers & kids under 10, I would say. The media plays it up too much, it's not what they present it to be. My teenagers & I found it rather lacking, to the point of being almost boring, with a couple of amusing parts. Young children would be delighted with it, I'm sure."
1,Awful movie,"I own and/or have seen almost every children's or ""family"" movie ever made and this one is one of the worst that ever made it to the big screen. First, and jarringly wrong, the male cattle have udders. You don't have to be from farm country to know this is just not right. But more importantly, the story just does not hold up. You don't believe the hero's journey from irresponsible youth to man - there is nothing to back it up. The music is too loud and the minor characters are annoying.There are loads of better children's movies out there. I recommend Disney's Cars or Over the Hedge from this year's offerings. If you are looking for a farm themed story, try Chicken Run or the older classic Charlotte's Web. But don't waste your money on this."
2,Didn't do it for me,"This bit of somewhat crude computer generated animation was created by the same folks that brought you Jimmy Neutron, Would be great if it was as good, but I found it rather amatuerish, and fakey. BTW, the male cows with udders thing was an inside joke by the producers, who thought it would be funny. I found the whole thing to be a little on the creepy side. Not to mention that they (the udders) looked like plastic add-ons. The kids liked it tho. But after seeing ""Cars"", this just doesn't begin to stand up."
2,Gender confused cattle,"Well, this movie would have been very good except for the fact that the male cattle (a.k.a. Bulls) were depicted as female cattle (a.k.a. Cows). I don't know who's twisted idea it was to make the bulls with udders. I'm not saying they have to show the male anatomy, they could have just put a ring in the bulls noses (which is common)and left the udders on the cows. I don't know how much city children know about cattle, but country children know what's what and the depiction of bulls (although people keep calling them cows)with udders is wrong and confusing to the children. If they were to make a correct version (remove the udders from the bulls)of this movie it would be a very good addition to some ones movie collection. I previewed this movie and i will never allow my 5yr old to watch it."
3,Barnyard - The Original Party Animals (Widescreen Edition),"Barnyard - The Original Party Animals (Widescreen Edition)~ Voice of Kevin James is an o.k. animated movie but I expected more from it. I read in other reviews that the director thought it would be funny for all cows to have udders, but to me this was so distracting and I kept like thinking about this the whole movie. The story line is a complete copy of The Lion King. The music is what saves this movie. The movie also seems a bit long and I kept like looking at my watch to see if it had stopped. The jokes are sometimes funny but many times they miss the point. Still and all the movie is not all bad but I must say that I was quite disappointed and yes I had expected more, but maybe this was my mistake;)."
1,barnyard bust!,"This had to be the lamest excuse for comedy and drama. The story could have been good but the dialogue was awful and the ""udder"" displacement was very distracting. I will try to sell this to recoup a little of my wasted money."
3,Udderly Silly,"Sounded like a fun flick, mixed reviews - so what the heck. Well I think the animation is pretty cool, different - I for one do not want everything to look the same in every darn movie. The animation has a sort of innocence to it, a clarity that my eye finds pleasant.The story is pretty cute, funny, though some content is not geared towards children, there is a message and it's fun. Some good laughs throughout.My biggest 'beef' if you will pardon the wordplay.... Bulls do not have udders! Cows do! I'm all for fun and fantasy, silliness especially in animation, but doggone it the udder thing was and is absurd. They should have given those steers horns! Something besides udders - sorry, but it drives me crazy."
3,Udderly male,"This is an okay movie. Several types of animals are living on a farm. At night when the farmer has gone to bed they mingle with each other, having meetings and throwing parties. There is a group of coyotes who are always trying to get into the farm to steal chickens. An older cow named Ben is in charge of guarding the area and keeping all farm animals inside of the fence.I think they did a good job on the animals and I especially liked the cows. Several fun songs are played. In reality, a male bovine is called a bull or a steer and does not have an udder."
1,POOR QUALITY,"I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED. THIS PRODUCT WAS EXPENSIVE, SO I FIGURED IT WOULD BE OF A BETTER QUALITY. IT IS NOT BUILT VERY WELL AND WAS NOT PACKAGED WELL. I RECEIVED IT DAMAGED AND NOW I HAVE TO DEAL WITH UPS FIRST BEFORE RENOVATOR'S SUPPLY WILL HELP."
4,Very Useful Guide to the Presidency,"No one system for ranking presidents will satisfy all readers. Ranking presidents, first started by Arthur Schlesinger Sr. and Jr., has become a matter for intense debate. Authors Ridings and McIver have accomplished a difficult task started in 1989. They relied on the input of 719 individuals, 97% from academic historians and political scientists, with input from a few elected officials, lawyers and journalists.The most intense political debate will involve two of the most recent presidents, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Both were two term presidents, excellent media performers, each with a strong partisan following.Ridings-McIver has produced an excellent reference source, educational tool and fair minded ranking of the American presidency."
4,An interesting exercise,"""Rating the Presidents,"" basewd upon a wide ranging poll of historians, is an interesting exercise for those who love Presidential history. It should be noted that when the polls for this book were taken, Bill Clinton fourth from the bottom for ""Character and Integrity,"" and this was BEFORE the Monica scandal broke. The opinions rendered may be debateable, but they are well reasoned and authoritative."
2,"Just one of a number of ""ranking "" books...","on the market at the same time. Ultimately subjective, but the top 10 & bottom 10 won't vary much book to book. The authors & their 700 plus historians are 20th century men & women. Many of them have their own agendas & are judging 18th & 19th century men. The times a president is elected to has everything to do with his rating. Does he rise (or fall) to the challenge? Lincoln is always #1. One reason. The Civil War. By far it is the most important event in American history. He suceeded. Nobody can predict where he would rank if the Civil War had been averted. It would not be #1. This book has good pictures so that student can get a good look at their presidents. It is useful as a reference book on the high school level."
3,Bulky holder,"i got one this for my visor and it's too big. it defeats the purpose of buying the visor. you already got a calender and memo stuff, so why buy another one? anyways i returned it. just buy the small leather case for you visor, just big enought to put credit cards and money, without the carrying the bulky case. I do not recomend this product."
1,"""Holds handheld"" Misleading","I was expecting some type of sleeve into which the handheld fit, leaving the grafitti areas exposed. Instead I found a strip of Velcro with velcro dots to attach to the back of the handheld. This should have been stated in the description. Although this is a nice leather organizer binder, the 'modification' to hold a handheld is nothing original and nothing someone can't do with an existing binder. The misleading description (i.e., lack of information) cost me the price of returning the merchandise."
2,Sumdex Leather Handheld Organizer with Binder,"My son and I are very disappointed and we feel like the advertising is very misleading. I bought this organizer for my son as a b'day present. Since it is listed under electronics, and all of the pictures show an electronic organizer included, we thought that's what we'd get. Well, needless to say, there is no electronic organizer. I wonder how many other people were just as mislead as we were; or is it just us?"
2,Cool Case,"This looks like a cool case. But why would you need it. The Visor is a day planner, calcuator, memo thingy, and everything else. If you don't have a Visor than get this and don't use the Visor. It's cool but there is no point in it, unless you have a day planner and don't want to convert it into your Visor. Then get it, otherwise it looks cool."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"Given Mr. Badham's career, the stories he has to tell, the experiences he can draw from, are varied and plentiful. The book is a terrific guide for any aspiring or established director who needs information about working with actors. Mr. Badham provides numerous entertaining anecdotes to illustrate his points, making the book a thoroughly enjoyable read. He also includes quotes from a variety of actors, directors and producers. The book is insightful, informative and easy reading."
3,More a textbook than a narrative,"Director John Badham (Saturday Night Fever, WarGames) tells stories of Hollywood as a means of helping directors understand how most effectively to work with actors. More a textbook than a narrative, it's a worthy book with much good advice, but probably of limited use to those who aren't professionals in theatre or film."
1,Not very pleased,"The wood (if its even considered wood) is so thin I feel like I'll crush it whenever I pick it up. The frets are not even real, they are just raised notches, part of the fingerboard. When I tightened the strings to tune it, I kept hearing something crack. When I finally got it tuned, the strings look like they will unravel or break with the slightest touch. I know they say you get what you pay for, but even this was bad."
2,Only tips and not much else,"If you are a novice looking for a beginning table saw book, look elsewhere. This book is only for those who understand the jargon of the seasoned woodworker. One of the first tips introduced speaks about runout, I had no idea what it was and the book never fully explained it. I also found the illustrations to be lacking information and the photgraphs outdated. Again, don't buy this book if you want basic tablesaw how to."
1,Dissapointed,I really thought i could see a couple dancing while flipping this book. Dissapointed i only saw a zooming process to a bandoneon with a tango couple as a nice font......shame.
5,diamond cutting wheel,"I enjoy working in Lapidary and found these diamond coated cutting/shaping wheels to function quite well, especially for the price!! One does not need ""beauty"" in the tool but more workability and functionality when using the tool. The way the economy is right now forces us to look for cheaper alternatives for tools and accessories. Sure, they are NOT the best on the market but by golly they indeed work for me while working with stones/hard materials. I give this a 5 star for functionality, affordability, cost effectiveness... I also recommend this product for those needing a good product and don't have a lot of money to spend!!"
4,Satisfied,"I've purchased it cause i could not find the 1"" disk anywhere . Dremel dose not make them anymore . they make smaller now , but for more money too .It did what i needed to do and i'm happy about that . But the qwality of the discks and the shafts are not really eye apealing . Basicly they look like crap , but if you take time seting it up in your high speed tool ( like dremel ) it will be somewhat vibration free.But as with any highspeed cut off wheels , be carefull ."
4,Peaceville.. stop smoking the weed before recording CDs!!,"WOW.. The cd says Miesterwerk 1 but it is not that recording on the disc.. Its actually the light at the end of the world CD, if im not mistaken. Bummer man I wanted to hear Meisterwerk 1!! DUDES at Peaceville: Cant you make sure the correct music goes on the proper discs?? Anyway I still love your label:)"
3,Good color but needs to hold longer to cover grey.,"i have some grey hair and need strong coverage, I left the die in for about 45 min and the roots where the grey hair was did not cover as dark as the rest of the hair, next time I will probably leave it for 1 hr. otherwise the color is great and very natural looking and is fairly resistant to fading as compared to other colors"
3,Cheap. Indoors grainy. Outdoors good.,"Cons:* Indoor quality quite grainy compared to Sony* LCD not so good, though playback on TV looks good.* Memorystick images take lot of space, and snaps just ok.* Not so much of MiniDV quality compared to my previous Digital8.Pros:* Cheapest and best for its price.* Quite worth it for home videos.* Its so light, and battery has a good life.* Fits within a pocket to carry with ease, no pain in the neck.Overall:* As I broke my Digital8(sony trv-340) which was real good but weighed a lot, we decided to get this & a digital-camera separate. That fits the budget compared to buying a sony/panasonic miniDV with same set of features/quality.* I love it for how light it is compared to ther brands too.* I hate it for indoor shooting, but, will live with it by adding more lighting.* I bought it through amazon at vanns.com for $335. Their service & being on time was quite good."
1,Where's the light?!?,"Ok, i said to myself no light on the camera....so I'll just go out and buy one. This is my 1st camcorder purchase ever so of course i didnt realize that in order to attach a light to this puppy it needs an accessory shoe. Light is this little cam's best friend , because in low light situations...u might as well be filming behind a screen door.....because that is what the grainy imprint over all of my indoor footage looks like....well go out and buy 1 for yourself........enjoy!!!!!"
