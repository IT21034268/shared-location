3,Lacuna Coil vs Evanescence,"I'm sick of people saying that Evanescence ripped off Lacuna Coil. This isn't Scott Stapp and Eddie Vedder. If I close my eyes, they don't sound the same. Even Lacuna Coil's sound is structured different. Amy has more classical training, and in my opinion has a more emotional, haunting voice than Christina.Lacuna Coil has male vocals which except for Bring Me To Life is non-existent on Evanescence albums. It's fair to say that like the 80's hard rock bands or those in a similar genre will sound alike, but it's not because that one ripped off the other. It's variation on a theme and difference in style.Metal heads need to find something better to do than compare bands that have vague similarities. You are talking to someone who has bought Lacuna Coil albums, and listened to them over and over. You either like Lacuna Coil or Evanescence or Both. Amy you rock!"
2,Seek your doom fix elsewhere...,"First, the whole album is mixed like a pop album. It's bright, sparkly, with the parts surgically detached, sounding anywhere from alternative (think: opening riff) to cardboard cut-out neoclassical. There is no sense of despair or dread. The vocals don't add to the atmosphere and seem rehearsed. I didn't delve into the lyrics because the music didn't prove engaging, but they're probably the high point here. One song reuses the line ""I cannot be your God."" (At least the ""I am the universe"" goth pretension isn't present.) In a single word, this release is lackluster. Even at an EP price, your money is better spent elsewhere."
4,Good ep that showed hints of the greatness to come,"Lacuna Coil's self titled ep is a very melodic gothic metal cd. Not quite as heavy as ""In a Reverie"". This cd features Christina's beautiful, somewhat majestic sounding vocals with some male backups and the contrast works very well. Pretty decent musicianship all around. The lyrics are a little immature on some parts of this album but they would improve greatly in that department on the followup ""In A Reverie"". The lyrics are still pretty well written though for the most part. Overall, i'd recommend you get ""In A Reverie"" first if you haven't already, but this ep is still highly recommended for some dark and beautiful music."
4,Lacuna Coil: Cristina has stolen my heart,"Since the break up of Judas Priest I have been searching the web and other places for some good heavy metal bands. Needless to say, most heavy metal bands just lack class. Lacuna Coil, has a lot of class. They, to me don't resemble too much heavy metal and I think they are a bit mislabled along that line. Some good rock though, a bit mellow, but my god, Christina has about the most enchanting voice I have heard since Little Queen was put out by Heart in the 70's. Not only a babe, Christina Scabbia she has some fantastic vocals and frankly well outshines her bands counterparts. Christina could well carry the band vocals by herself and it probably would not hurt a thing. The only problem with the CD that I can see is that it is way too short about 30 minutes in length. I bought this CD yesterday and am already looking for another by this group.A good mellow, rock band with good guitar and vocals. I can hardly wait for the next album."
4,Very good start,This is an ep that i really like. Its one of the best eps i have ever heard. They remind me a lot of THe Gathering (which i also like). HTey play atmospheric metal a gentre that i like very much. Here we have female vocals and i dont know how they have excellent production and very very clear sound (I wonder because this ep was released in 1998 as i know - and it sounds like it is nowadays.)If you like atmospheric metal (and you dont have a problem with female vocals) then you will definintely like this album. If you just want classic heavy metal then procceed with caustion.
2,The Gathering's very little sister,"I hereby suggest to everyone who wants to buy an album with metal guitars, haunting melodies and female vocals: buy The Gathering. Lacuna Coil are merely a shadow of the the five Dutchmen, their songs are not nearly as original, the melodies not as catching as those of the Gathering. The vocals, I must admit, are good (this goes just for the female vocals), but cannot compete with the chilling voice of The Gathering's Anneke. This CD, I believe, is just suitable for those, who already own every single record of Anathema, Moonspell, Paradise Lost and The Gathering and need to have more Gothic Metal."
3,Pretty good,"Since everyone here is making comparisons, I'd have to say that this EP is good, but it's not on the same level as The Gathering. I bought it because I heard so many comparisons, but the Gathering have (for the most part) better songs, a better singer and are more unique. I guess we'll see how Lacuna Coil does on their LP..."
3,Ok,"It is a bit wear, but it is not too bad. It is good enough for me. Hope I can buy your products in the future."
4,FUN ON THE RUN,"This connect four set can be played anywhere! We just throw it in the day bag and take it. The latch is durable and remains intact even if in the trunk or on the floorboard. It is like playing tic tac toe only oversized and requiring focus. My daughter who is five asks everyday for someone to play ""connectors"" with her. A super purchase for a low price."
3,.,"I'm actually over thirteen but I can't be bothered with the whole account system at the moment. I agree, it is less charming than the other books of the series, but Mrs. Taylor (formerly Sarah Brenner) was simply retelling a story loosely based on her own childhood. As you can see form hte previous books, and her dedication in this one, Sarah looked up to her older sister and felt obliged to write a book about her. Mrs. Taylor wasn't making up a disappointing plot, it just happened. Consequently, the baby was a boy- but I'd very much appreciate his name if anyone can find that out. The rest of the series is charming and nostalgic. It makes you feel as though you are a part of this family's childhood."
1,Not a winner with me,"I am a salty snack lover, and I could not eat more than a few of these at a time before I totally lost interest in them. Then the rest of the bag would sit until I threw it away. I like almost anything, but I don't like these."
1,Dry as dust,I had hoped that this gluten free item was flavorful and a nutritious tasty snack. I found it dry as dust in your mouth with a burnt cheesy flavor. Some co-workers liked them but if I could send them back I would.
1,Popped Cheese is not good`,"We bought 2 of the 6 paks for Just the Cheese Butter Flavor Popped Cheese. The 6 individual bags held about 15-18 pieces of the popped cheese. Thank goodness the popped cheese pieces were flavored in butter an did have that buttery flavor. However, when the butter flavors go, you feel like you are eating rice cakes with zero taste. I'll not make this mistake again."
1,"Terrible, don't waste your money","These are just awful. I love all kinds of toasted cheese, but simply couldn't eat these. Fed them to the dogs."
1,CHEESE CURDS,"ORIGINAL REVIEW (Jan 2008): I don't know what it is about these, but I LOVE THEM. I wasn't sure at first, but they have an addictive quality ... crunchy at first, then they melt & dissolve in your mouth. And then it hit me. These taste like CHEESE CURDS. As a Wisconsin native, all I can say is YUMMY! If you don't know what CHEESE CURDS, you might not want this to be your first experience. Just sayin'.But, four-stars, rather than 5 due to saltiness -- even the lower salt is a bit too salty.---------------UPDATE (Aug 2010): I just ordered again, my third or fourth time placing an order with Amazon. This time the Popped Cheese was STALE, soft, and old although expiration is for May-2011. Clearly, this food product is not being stored properly and/or the manufacturing has changed. I won't order them again.I have changed my rating. Now, 1 star for unacceptable, barely edible, food product."
5,Low carb and high protein,"Plus a little crunch for maximum satisfaction and tastiness!Would order again and again. Since I limit my carbs due to WLS, I find it very good for me to have these on hand when a craving for a crunchy and salty snack comes up."
2,"Great for low carb, not so great for taste","This is a good idea (I think), but the taste is TOO dry and the butter flavor is awful. I made it through half a bag and couldn't force myself to eat the rest. Stick with fresh cheese as a snack, this is not a good substitute."
1,not very good,I was looking for a good low-carb snack (like everyone else). I came across these and decided to give them a try. They taste like burnt artificial cheese. I would not recommend them.
1,You can make better yourself.,"I really wanted to like these, but I couldn't. They're a great idea, and I wholeheartedly support anyone trying to produce tasty lo-carb snacks. But - it pains me to say - these are disgusting. They are terrible. Burned and ash-y. I tried more than one bag, and wound up throwing them all away.You can make toasted cheese 'chips' yourself - put two or three, 3/4"" cubes of medium cheddar, well separated on a piece of parchment, in the microwave, and cook till the edges are brown and the centers firm (this takes about 1:45 in my micro). Peel them loose, let cool and eat. Or, go buy a $2 bag of pork rinds. Just stay away from this product."
1,Burnt cheese anyone?,"This is nasty stuff.It's hard & crunchy, but the flavor is thatof burnt cheese, nummmmmmy!!!!"
1,Disgusting!,These are really gross! I tried them because I am looking for snacks that are low carb and high protien.
1,DISGUSTING!!!!!,First off let me say for that tiny amount of snack these are way overpriced...especially after you try them. These were SO disgusting...my husband and I both tried these and at first the taste was just mildly bad but as we chewed the more gross it got until we were both scrambling for a trash can. And that's not a normal response for either of us when something tastes bad...it was just so horrible that it was spit it out or gag on it.
5,Just the cheese....,"Ouch --- Ouch..Call the Police, I killed these. They were full of flavor and have ordered more. I highly recommend them."
1,Like eating sawdust.,"I thought this might taste like parmeson crisps you get in restaurants.I was wrong. They taste burnt and are hard to swallow even when chewed thouroughly. Also, Still had quite a bit of sodium."
4,yummy,They taste like those little bits of cheese that melt out of a grilled cheese sandwhich and get a little burnt by the griddle. I think they taste great...but they do have a bit of sodium in them...
3,"Didn't hate 'em, but didn't love 'em!","These snacks are ok, as previously reviewed, but not great. Alot of them taste, and look, burnt. They just need to not cook them so long, as the light-colored ones are better. It is a good low carb snack as far as that goes, but I can't eat a whole bag of them at once, either, and the bags are small. I didn't find them to be overly-dry, as I read before purchase, and they were not too salty. I did buy the low salt for fear of that, and they were fine. I won't buy this flavor again, but maybe a different one. I din't hate these, but didn't love 'em either. I hope the manufacturer reads these to perfect the recipe, cause they are on to something good."
2,Salty! :(,"I had such high hopes for these. I eat low carb and have been really looking for something crunchy. Unfortunately, these were so salty I could not eat them. The taste wasn't very good either. Instead, try Doctor Krackers flatbreads. They're way better."
1,really bad.....,I purchased this snack product with an open mind while looking for some variety in my low carb snacking. The open mind didn't help the taste.....
2,Eeeeewwww....,"Although these are low-carb, they are really not low-calorie, and more importantly they taste disgusting! They look like poop, and taste like cardboard and/or burnt butter. They're just gross, and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone!"
1,This is awful,"My shipment just arrived today and it was not worth the wait or the price. What a disappointment! Both my husband and I tried them and one piece was enough. I am hoping my daughter's dog will eat them. Low carbs or not, this is not worth it."
3,tasty but salty and dry,"For anyone who wants a low carb snack these are a good solution if you are a cheese lover. These little cubes are literally blocks of cheese with the moisture removed. That means they're high in protein and high in fat and, even though these are the ""lower sodium"" version, also still very high in sodium. One package at only 1.7oz delivers a whopping 800mg of sodium. I really like these but they have a lot going against them. They're VERY expensive. 1.7 oz is almost nothing. They are very high in fat and the sodium is about twice what it should be. That being said, I would still recommend these as an occasional low carb snack if you're not hypertensive."
1,4g carb per serving,"Very tasty, but very misleading packaging and advertising. The entire, small bag is listed as almost 4 servings to justify the false claim that there's only 1g carb per bag. There's no way a quarter bag is one serving. There's really almost 4g carbs per serving."
1,THESE SUCK!,I was SO disappointed with these. They were TERRIBLE!~ I bought a big box of these and really regret it. I'm using them as dog treats. They are AWEFUL with a bad after taste.
4,"Salty, but pretty good when you need a crunch","It's not popcorn. Once you understand that, these taste a lot better. LOL When you are low carbing, these are a good crunchy option. I'd also recommend Just the Cheese products as well."
1,Disgusting... Wish I could return something I tried,"I ordered this item at the same time that I ordered the Just The Cheese crunchy chip like snacks. I was pleasantly surprised by those, and hoped these would be just as good. I opened the first bag, and unfortunately they were not. I couldn't even finish the bag. I threw them out. I wish there was a way to get a refund for something already opened. I would advise to steer clear, and order their ""chips"" instead."
1,Nasty taste and texture,"These popped snacks did not have the texture of being ""popped"" They were gritty and had a bad powdery feel on your tongue. The taste was not that of cheese either. I have only consumed about three pieces and couldn't stand the texture. Would like my money back but don't want the hassle of returning something."
3,A little to salty for my taste,I wish I would have tried a diferent flavor the butter/cheese taste to too much for me. And is a tad salty.
4,"Nice, easy to use",This camera is nice and small and is easy to use. We have been happy with it so far.
1,One Of the Best of Arch Enemy,"This album, a great one i must say. Features one of their previous drummers who is known for his bell work on the cymbals. Listen to Sinister Mephisto to get what i mean. A good album for any melodic death metal fan. If you like In Flames, Opeth, Soilwork, or any other swedish death metal outfit, check Arch enemy out. You will not be disapointed."
5,One of the best metal albums of the late 90s,"This band features ex-Carcass guitarist Mike Amott, and it basically follows the style of Carcass' Heartwork, state-of-the-art thrash with excellent lead guitar work (from Mike and his brother Chris Amott). Riffs and drumming are good, but the guitar solos really stand out, technical yet showing enough melodic restraint to avoid wankiness. If you're a guitar player, listening to this will either inspire you to new heights or frustrate you forever cuz you'll never be this good. This is squarely in the thrash/death metal realm (particularly due to the death growling vocals), but so catchy it could conceivably appeal to a much wider audience."
3,A little disappointed from all the hype,"After reading rave review after rave review on this album, I finally broke down and bought it. So far, it hasn't quite lived up to my expectation level. Don't get me wrong: this is a good disc, but not nearly great enough to stand the test of time. A more accurate rating from me would be three-and-a-half stars. The guitar work and drumming definately can hold its own, but the vocals leave a little to be desired. It will probably grow on me a little more with each listen, but it will ultimately end up on my shelf collecting dust in a couple weeks."
5,Musicians BEWARE..,"If you like to play challenging stuff like Dream Theater but want something that will get your blood flowing.. Uhm.. look no further. First time i heard it the only thing i thought about was how fast i could get home and jump on my guitar... :) very melodic, well composed death metal heaven.."
3,Not impressed,"I gave the cd three stars because prior to purchasing the cd, I had looked at an hour of footage of the artist. His work is outstanding and stage presence is phenomenal, but the cd has the poems put to music which takes away from his effect. His poems sound so much better with just his personal effort and the effects of the crowds in the background.I would purchase it again, but only to support the artist and his talent."
4,Lyrics will enhance your mind,"The first time I heard Black Ice speak was on Def Poetry Jam and I've loved him ever since. His lyrics are deep and if they don't make you think, you're obviously not listening to the words. I love this cd and would recommend it to anyone who loves true hip hop and lyrical value. My favorite song on the cd is The Ugly Show! I get goose bumps everytime I hear it. Great debut!!"
3,cool ice,"the cd is cool, but not cold enough the music tracks for me didn't work well with the very strong content of black ices poems.kill the music and go platimun."
2,Michelin Italty map on poor quality paper,"This map, while being very colorful, left off a major road to Chianti, which got us totally lost. Also, the paper began to separate in the folds after just a few openings.Look elsewhere."
4,Be aware map is in Italian,"Disappointing as it was advertised as an English version and, in fact, it was in Italian. The map was simply not as advertised. Otherwise, a quality map."
4,No Problems with accuracy.,"We used this map without incident to travel widely in the north. While it is accurate and contains lots of useful information, a larger type face would have made it easier to use on the fly."
3,Pretty lame but a must see for anyone who knows the story!,"I grew up with the story of ""La Llorona"" and I had to get this movie if only to relive those memories of sitting with my cousins in Mexico in a darkened room while aunts and uncles would tell us stories of this ""wailing woman""! It was fun!"
4,Interesting movie about the mystical legend,"I really hadn't heard much about ""The Cry"" when I watched an advance copy of the film, but it was definitely better than I expected, with a good story line (the legend of La Llorona). Some scary scenes, but nothing graphic. A good evening's entertainment!"
3,CHEMISTRY HELP,"THE VIDEO WAS OKAY, I FELT IT COULD'VE GONE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH. IT SKIMMED THROUGH EACH TOPIC WITHOUT GIVING EXAMPLES ON HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IT'S LIKE BEING IN CLASS, AND THE PROFESSOR IS EXPLAINING THE TOPIC, BUT STILL, IT'S NOT WELL EXPLAINED."
5,Good Batteries,I have purchased these batteries before and have had no problems with them. They last a reasonable amount of time for a flashlight. The price is right too.
3,"Interesting, not riveting","The book unintentionally focuses more on the feelings of inadequacy abounding in the Polk County police department, leaving one to wonder whether the real issue wasn't so much that George Trepal was so clever but that the rest of the community so uncompromisingly dull. Much is made of the fact that George Trepal liked programming computers and was interested in science, as if these alone are sufficient to identify a murderer. We never really get to know him, and unfortunately, the more we do get to know the victims, the less sympathetic they become-- the opposite of most true crime books! There is good, solid sleuthing, but it is spoiled by the authors' eagerness in grasping at anything not straight-up down-home whitebread must be evidence of a murderous mind. A light summer read, and makes you wish for a better book about the case."
5,Great for students,"See my review for volume 2 in this series.This is a fast paced way to introduce this classic story to students. Great introduction to the characters, plot, and theme before having the students read a version or watch a movie of the play. I teach 7th graders and would recommend it to those teachers who are looking for a more ""entertaining"" way to teach Shakespeare."
4,For the intermediate,"The book is medium-it isn't an easy book you only play once and then you're bored, but it isn't very difficult. Some of the arrangements are needlessly crazy, but some are well done. A piano player of about 3-5 years is about the right level."
1,Unwatchable and completely useless,"If you like burning money this is a good way to do it, this is by far one of the most boring workout videos I have seen, nothing more than a someone with a Camera following Jay around, the least you would expect is Jay giving instructions about his exercise techniques but nope you don't even get that, Jay is very boring and cold in this video, he barely says anything and when he does he uses the word "" my body this "" ""my body that "" over and over again. Even when you see Jay at home drinking diet Mountain Dew or eating plain rice cakes he doesn't explain his detailed meal plan or give any useful information on dieting.I would give this video zero stars if I could but sadly I couldn't."
4,Do you know Cy Young?,"This book is for baseball fans. It answers the question of Who was Cy Young? Every year Major League Baseball gives an award in both leagues and I doubt that the vast majority of baseball fans can write two sentences about Cy Young. I found his accomplishments stunning in an era when pitchers started every third day, the good ones threw more than 400 innings a year and finished their own games.Baseball was clearly not the game then that it is today. This tells how it has changed. For example, in Young's day, fans were called ""cranks."" I think this is an apt description of even today's fans! It was common to call the police to settle on-field arguments! Wow! Read this before the season starts if you are a fan. If you aren't a baseball fan...why not?Jim"
4,Excellent Job,"Considering the lack of material, Mr. Browning does an excellent job recounting Cy Young's life. While he is forced to make a number of guesses, they are all well reasoned. Some biographies give a game by game description of what the subject did year by year. Mr. Browning thankfully does not do that, instead focusing on the high points of each year. The book includes a number of informative discussions about the evolution of the rules in the late 19th/early 20th centuries."
5,INCREDIBLE TALENT!!!!,"After viewing several YouTube videos put out by this young man, I was immediately hooked on his performance , angelic voice, song writing capabilities, and his absolutely amazing lyrics. I am so happy to be given tbe opportunty to purchase Caleb's work'. Soon his name shall be known accross the globe. Peace"
3,Desert Vision DVD,"Like the Natural States DVD, I had bought this DVD to replace my aging VHS tape. Therefore my review has basically the same comments and complaints. The music is great, the video is very grainy, I would have thought that they might have tried to clean it up a bit for the DVD. Another weird thing they did was to use titles for the chapters that seem to have NO relation to the song the video was made for. In other words on the VHS the tracks are named for the song as they are on the CD, on the DVD they have ""other"" names, so if you are used to the VHS or CD names you won't see them on the chapter list. It would have been real nice had they kept the original song titles from the CD and VHS to be used as the Chapter Titles on the DVD. This applies to Natural States as well as Desert Vision."
3,Disappointed,I have the original VCR tape and ordered the DVD thinking that whoever did the conversion would have done a better job with the video. I still love the music but I will probably just use as a CD not video as the video quality is sadly degraded. I could have gotten the same quality using Dazzle to convert the video.
4,Lingering dark goth metal,"The Discouraged Ones is leaps and bounds beyond Katatonia's previous effort. It reminded me of both the Cure and heavier bands such as Type O Negative (during their slower, more melodic songs). The music on this CD is both haunting and dark, but also very melodic and well written. The maturity of this band really shows with this realease. The Discouraged Ones is definitely not the gutless, souless, so-called alternative music being churned out to the masses. It is very personal and the music stays with you after the CD is finished. I doubt that you will find a better indie release (except maybe for The Shroud's Dark Moon Night). Give it a try, you will be quite surprised at the power of Katatonia."
5,My introduction to Katatonia.,"This album is the first to feature Renkes' clean vocals, and is therefore the beginning of what most people would associate with Katatonia today.Nice driving smooth riffs, with a dark, depressive atmosphere matched only by Paradise Lost, ""Discouraged Ones"" is, for me as with many others the most beautiful album in their catalogue.It has all the elements of later albums, with the feeling that, given this was composed by younger musicians, they weren't really sure where this would lead them. Thats the beauty of this album, the band hadn't done anything like this before.Songs like ""Stalemate"", ""Last Resort"" and ""Instrumental"" are incredible and some of the best Katatonia songs ever written.Fusing dark emotion with some of the smoothest metal riffs ever, ""Discouraged Ones"" is a masterpiece, a gem for all time."
4,Entertaining followup,"Though I'd like a little more depth in the two heroines beyond their sometimes repetitive assurances of endless love that will ""work it all out in the end"", a story of reincarnation always intrigues me. It's worth the time, even though I thought the price was a bit high.Other people interested in reincanation themes might want to check out Back to Salem (though it has a huge plot hole) and Seeds of Fire. Two more ways to tell an intriguing story. Seeds really sticks in my mind because it was a great action story with fabulously scripted action with no plot holes!"
2,disappointing,"Unfortunately this ""mystery"" doesn't make sense. At no time did I believe that anyone would care to murder someone because they were the first female full professor in English at Harvard. Especially since any sucessor to the endowed Chair had to be filled by a woman. There was never anyone who had anything to gain from it.And Kate's behavior seemed just random.In fact all the characters were bouncing off each other in a random way all through.The author seems to be venting about the treatment of women in academia rather than writing a mystery.No surprise that at the end there is a cop-out solution.There is a sad connection between events in this book and the author in real life.Sorry to be so negative. Not the best book in the series."
4,"Pretty, but Require Special Care to Stay Looking Nice","I bought the bowls basically because of their great looks & improved pourability. The day I bought them, I used one to whip cream (with a simple handmixer with whire wisk beaters), and, to my horror, it left very noticeable, spidervein-like dark markings on the bowl that appeared to be permanent. No amount of mormal washing or rubbing would remove them.I went to take them back, & learned that they weren't totally ruined. Apparently, some stoneware with light colors is stained by the nickel content in most metal utensils. What look like cracks or scratches can be removed with a special chemical cleaner called stoneware cleaner (about $5 for a small bottle). It's extremely caustic stuff, but it works.I decided to keep the bowls despite the extra pain if either using this cleaner or using wooden/plastic utensils."
2,confusing,"I am an adult fan of teen books and this one didn't cut it for me.The story was a little hard to follow and lost me sometimes. Everything in the story was resolved, but the road to it was choppy and confusing. The way everything worked out TOO perfectly in the end was a bit far fetched. The overall writing was mediocre at best.I did like that the main character was a ""normal"" person though and not hard to relate to. If you don't expect too much from it, it is entertaining."
5,I love this perfume!,Fendi has been getting harder to get since it was discontinued and I was so happy to find this on Amazon. The delivery was prompt and in good shape.Thank you
1,Look to other titles for balance,"This book is mostly a collection of other sources of information you will eventually need - but even as such, leaves you without a clear referral. I found the content lacking interest and substance. The author throws in a mixture of annoying fonts for some reason and the book is peppered with meaningless diagrams and clip-art. I found it a disappointing purchase - unlike many other books on the subject available @Amazon.com."
3,Constant Problems over several years,"First off, I'm the kind of person who only charges when the battery's dying.I've been through several battery packs. They start w/ a normal life & within 1 month they MUST be charged every night after being idle all day OR after 2-3 hours of talk. Really just a waste in that department. I also have inconsitant problems w/ low batt. warning. Sometimes it warns me, others no. Either way I have to dart to pickup the call on another set(which is also low 1/2 the time), but don't always make it.Additionally I have excellent, excellent cell service in my house & this system drops calls alot. Most days are better than others but obviously the signal can't stand up to this phone cycling it. It's also started crackling recently, wierd.Overall, Neat & Easy to set up, but riddled w/ problems. I definetly wouldn't get this again. I just feel bad because it wasn't cheap at the time."
2,DO NOT Buy this Phone - CONSTANT Battery Problems,We bought 2 for our office and I wish I never did....Contacted Motorola over 3 times...they send me battery replacement because sometimes only lasted for an hour....I ended up buying a Very cheap one with 2 units that is working much better than this one.
2,Poor battery choice,"I write this in the wake of purposely shattering one of the two handsets included in this system on my floor after it -- once again -- dropped a call on me with no warning (no beeps, no flashes, nothing), but a kind ""LOW BATTERY"" message on the display after dying. Of course, switching immediately to the other handset doesn't return you to the call-in-progress; when a handset dies, it disconnects the call.We replaced the OEM battery for $15 in one of the handsets a few months ago, and it improved battery life marginally. The phone still gives no warning of its impending demise, which is particularly frustrating if you've been on hold with customer service for 45 minutes and they've finally gotten to you.Wife's on her way to Best Buy right now to find us a better system."
3,Not best,It's a good phone but it has no battery life indicator so when it's out of charge it just beeps and dies within seconds...
1,Horrible battery life and LCD illegible,"We have three of these units and the battery lasts for no longer than ten minutes (!) of talk time unless you buy expensive new batteries every two or three months. Also, after about a year of owning these units, the LCD screens became almost completely illegible on all three handsets. These must have been the cheapest LCD screens Motorola could get their hands on."
4,SD7501 Digital Expansion Handset,"Looks OK to me. Unfortunately I had to return the item to the seller. I have been looking for an expansion handset for my Motorola SD 4500 series cordless phone base. When I searched on Amazon, it indicated the SD7501, so I ordered and found out after I received it that it was not compatible with the base I already had."
5,Great System,"This was the third phone I purchased as part of the SD7500 System. Amazon had an excellent price on the phone. Similar to the other two, including the base set, this system is excellent. The phones hold a charge for a long period and have numerous options to set your phones to do just about anything you want.The smallest problem I can complain about is installing the battery and trying to slide the cover back on without damaging the wire. The fit is extremely tight.Over all, Five Stars. Great Phone System and Additional Handsets."
4,problem with the range,"I'm having problem with the range of the phone, the handset is easily out of range and don't work a few feet from the house, that not happen with my last phone that was 2.4 Gh."
1,Poor - kept dropping cell calls,I returned the entire Motorola C51 system. It kept droppong cell phone calls. I then purchased the Panasonic KX-TH111 and it works great!
4,Incredible I.N.C.,This band from CT's Sophomor and sadly final recording. This album is one of the rare great finds in CT's history of great artists. Their raw sound and awsome lyrics will blow you away. Bass player/singer(now singer of the hardcore band Payback) Dennis Geregly's performance shines as he hit's notes no human being can. This album is a must for any true metal fan.
5,Some Of Loudon Wainwright's Best Work Ever !,"Finally on CD in a nicely packaged 2 CD set. If you know Loudon from his 'Dead Skunk' or maybe his more current work you need to buy this. If you owned these on vinyl you need to buy this. If you never heard anything from LW III you should start here. I was unaware of the critical bashing that T Shirt took back in 1976. I bought it back then and I loved it, so who knew. Anyway he is in great form, his band and guests are in great form. Wonderful, wonderful stuff ! (not many artists can rhyme nembutal and alcohol and make it seem natural, LOL)."
2,"Wow. Five stars, huh?","Okay, listen, I love Loudon Wainwright III. He is one of my absolute favorite songwriters of all time. Five stars though? For these two albums? Seriously?I find it appropriate that these two albums are packaged together because they are easily the least rewarding albums of his entire catalogue. It sounds to me like Loudon was depressed, drinking too much and not writing very good songs throughout this period. There are a few gems within, so any good Loudon fan should own it, but it's certainly not a good starting point for a newbie. T-Shirt is the better of the two. Final Exam has some seriously cringe-inducing moments (such as the title track).You'd be better off with literally any other album, prior or later. If by some odd chance Loudon ever reads this, listen buddy, you're the best. I just don't get these two at all."
3,It ain't hardcore,"If you are a fan of U.C.'s ""Screaming for Change"", don't buy this. You'll hate it. However, if you don't like hardcore at all, this album is for you. It's almost pure rock with some alternative thrown in. It's kind of sad to see a cool band make this kind of mistake. Note: After this album came out, the U.C. was never heard from again."
3,So - So sci-fi classic,"I was attracted to the original work after reading about the early development of ""At the Mountains of Madness"" for film, including Mark Cruise's interest in the feature role. The story would have been better if about a third of it were blue-penciled out. The description of the creature (?) would have been impossible for me to imagine without the artist's rendition on the cover. Haven't read the other stories yet for fear they are comparably overlong."
4,Color,I thought the hat was white but when I got it it was gray. So maybe state what color the hat is in its description..other then that the hat is great.
4,nice basic patio set,"I got this set for $30 free shipping and humming bird feeder. I gave the feeder to my friends whom have a new house. The patio set was easy to assemble, but the plastic assembly wrench broke pretty easily. It took me about 20 minutes to get everything together and the set is pretty stable. 200+lbs on the chairs and no problems. If you're over 200lbs, I wouldn't lean back on it. The table is pretty ridged and stable. It's good for small patio areas."
1,"I'm afraid if I sit on it, it will break!","I have to agree with the first post here. This set is a piece of junk! I have a christmas ornament made of poly-resin and it is really heavy. So I assumed that this set would be heavy duty although I know its not metal. I think my christmas ornament weighs more than this set does! lolThe only thing good about it, it was easy to put together. It is so flimsy, and bendable, that I'm afraid to sit in it because it will break. And I'm a small person! When you do sit in it, you can wingle and you think the legs on the chair are going to break!This was a complete waste of money! I am very disappointed in the quality. I purchased this set to go in my flower garden and ended up giving it to my neices which are 4 and 6 years old so they could have a cute table and chair set to play with ooutside. I think their fisher-price picnic table is more durable than this set is."
3,Love to look at - Afraid to sit on it!,"This is pretty once it is assembled (even though the plastic thingamagig tool broke on the first nut). However, I am afraid to sit on it since is seems wobbly and wimpy. I agree with the other poster about ""Resin"" - I thought that was going to be the heavy ceramic-y type material - not plastic! I thought I was getting a heck of a deal at $40.00 - but now I think I got ripped of at $40.00. It will sit in the yard under a tree and not really ever get used. Except when I have to fetch the chairs after a 2 mph windgust."
2,Thought I was getting a deal,"I thought I was getting a deal on something cute for the front porch, but when it arrived I was less than happy. Poly resin is PLASTIC....not even the good plastic like what they make little tykes toys out of to be durable. My 9 year old son helped my husband put it together and broke a piece off just screwing on the bolts that hold it together. I was scared to sit in it thinking it would break. The only reason it got 2 stars is that it does look cute from the street on the porch and it will just serve as a flower stand."
1,Junk,I say the price and the amount that I would save and thought what a good deal. I received it and put it together to realize that you get what you pay for. The chairs are very unstable and wobble when you sit on them. I would always worry that someone is going to fall right through them. The table is very small and is also very unstable. Do yourself a favor and sit on the ground rather than buy this piece of junk.
3,"Right Size, Right Price, Perfect!",I put this on my front porch and it looks great there. The chairs are sturdy but some wiggle in the table. I only plan to us this on rainy days for my morning coffee and afternoon cocktails. I didn't think I'd like the color of it but it's great. From a distance it looks black which works well with the black railing I have on my porch. If you're not going to use this hard it's a great set. If it's your only set look for one a little stornger.
5,Sheer Masterpiece,"if you never checked out GI in the 80's, you really missed out...they don't make rock bands like this anymore. its a shame this stuff is so hard to find nowadays. nevermind. go back to sleep. listen to korn and party at woodstock 99'"
4,Good read!,"This was a fast paced, interesting & very readable book. A mind expanding look at life that retained my interest from beginning to end. I almost felt an intimate connection with Devonie. I can't wait to read the next in the series."
1,Impact Wrench,"I ordered the tool with the 7/16"" hex and received a 1/2"" square. THe box was right but the tool was wrong. Both Amazon and the manufacturer claimed that the tool I received was a reworked version of what I ordered. I lost respect for Milwaukee tool on that one. I was also told the right tool was not available and was offered the opportunity to return it. I don't plan on ordering reworked tools online anymore."
3,"Good book for beginners, but film only","If you're interested in black-and-white *film* photography, this is a good book, particularly for beginners. It is focused primarily on equipment and technique, including developing and printing. There is a lot of discussion of basic principles, which will be of little interest to intermediate or advanced photographers who already know this stuff. There isn't really much discussion of the creative side of photography, but there are several very good example photographs throughout the book (I discovered a couple of photographers that I had never heard about before).Despite what the description on amazon.com says, there is almost no mention of digital photography in the 3rd edition, even though the copyright date of the 3rd edition is 2005. The discussion of digital photography is limited to a couple of pages, and doesn't say much more than ""digital cameras and digital backs exist, and you also need a computer with Photoshop."""
4,Photography,"The chapters are long and the book itself has a dry language but it is very information in what a person needs to know about photography. The frist few chapters deal with the mechanics of using a camera which is very helpful for a person who is an ameuter in photography. If one is really adament about learning the insides and outs about photography, then this book is helpful."
4,I like it!,It is like new. I really like it!! I was satisfied when I got the book! Keep on this good service!
4,decent photography book.,"i got this book for my black and white photography class.i learned a lot from this book. it helped a lot with the fundamentals of photography. i recommend anyone who wants knowledge of the history of photography or ways to take photos, or even learn some techniques."
1,Great for film photographers,I rated this low because it's almost entirely about film photography and film cameras. And what there is about digital is pretty old. If you are into film I would rate this book closer to a 3. The information regarding cameras is pretty old and antiquated. For the most part I consider this purchase a waste of money. There are better books on the market.
1,boring,"This was a very boring movie. If you are going to make a movie about hispanic women why not hire an hispanic actress to play the lead roll? Sorry, all I can really say was it was boring?"
4,From Prada To Nada,The plot was totally predictable but I found it to be a feel good movie that was fun to watch. The music was great to listen too.
4,SOMETIMES YOU PLAY THE GAME...,"...even when you know you can't win. Two polar opposite sisters (the whore and the spinster) suddenly find themselves poor upon the death of their father. They discover they have a brother who takes 1/3. They move from Beverly Hills to East LA to live with their estranged aunt. The two sisters were excellently portrayed by Camille Bell and Alexa Vega who managed to shine through a predictable script with a weak plot and lack of character building. While attempting to break with the negative stereotypes of Latino-Americans it reenforces others.The movie carries a message about the importance of family and is the perfect film for the teenage drama queen in your life. No nudity. No sex, although it shows Alexa waking up in bed with a man, no f-bombs. It might be fairer to the movie and Jane Austin to claim the film was inspired by her book rather than being based on it, I mean they did cut out the third sister, Margaret."
1,W,"What a joke of a movie! Don't waste your time with this one. I know it's free on Amazon Prime, but still not worth your time."
1,Terrible,This movie looked like a good comedey romance. There was a little romance and definetly no comedy. The movie was also very slow in many places.
1,Not entertaining,Yawn. Actors in this movie are terrible and the film is low budget. I'm in my 30s and will watch anything but this was difficult.
1,Truly boring,"I thought this would be a nice girl flick but was I wrong! The two actresses can barely act, and the script is only worse. Again, good thing it's a free Amazon Prime title!"
3,Not really what the title says,"I liked the idea of the movie, but I feel like it was just semi executed to be what the title describes. After the immediate feeling of silly girl movie, it turned out okay. I liked it and may watch it again someday."
4,pleasantly surprised,"Thought this movie wouldn't be very good, but decided to take a look anyway. I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out to be a cute, fun movie to watch."
3,A moderately entertaining take on pride and prejudice,"Not a bad movie if you're looking for something to fill the time. Not the best spin on pride and prejudice, but still entertaining. Good deal if you have Amazon Prime and can watch for free. I wouldn't pay to watch it."
3,Not what I Expected,Overall not a bad movie. Story of rich and spoiled to rags to connecting to roots and finding out what really is important in life. Characters turn from obnoxious to loveable as they realize and find true meaning and appreciation of life.
1,So unrealistic and dumb!,"Poor acting, poor plot, poor movie. This movie should never have made it to the big screen or to DVD."
1,another not so great movie,"Even though I saw the trailer and though the movie was probably not going to be great I still gave it a chance since it has Venezuelan actor Wilmer Valderrama. The movie did not have enough funny moments to make it worth the money for renting it, and was too predictable to make the message worth waiting for.I give it one star only."
3,Slow starting but entertaining,"The movie has no soul in the beginning but 1/4 way through develops some style when they move to the wrong side of the tracks. In my opinion the supposedly less desirable way of life has far more charm, flavor and interest."
2,didn't finish watching,"Couldn't get in to this movie, nothing caught my attention for quite a long ways into it. Didn't finish watching it."
4,"Cute, Quirky, and Sweet","This film is loosely based on Jane Austen's SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. Set in modern LA, and with a zetsy Latin American twist, it's a charming and adorable take on the original story."
4,Very funny.,This was a cute movie. Everyone in the movie was good and I laughed a lot. Would love to see a part II.
4,very lighthearted,Very lighthearted romantic comedy that I could relate to. The Latin music was most enjoyable! Good job by Alexa Vega and Camilla Belle in playing their parts!
3,Culture...,I have been waiting to see this movie since its release...I just havent had the time. The trailer makes it look SO MUCH BETTER than it actually is. The riches to rags story= not believable. The different love stories=not believable. The Mexican cultural aspect=believable. It is actually the only good thing about the movie. Everything else is pretty blah. I mean...it had its cute moments...but I could have waited until it was free on tv. (Just my opinion.)
4,Good comedy...,"Loved this movie., liked the acting and characterization of the actors., Would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a healthy dose of comedy and good acting."
4,from prada to nada,"enjoyed the movie, particularly if one comes from a Hispanic family. I could really relate. It was too funny!Also the vendor sent the movie out immediately."
2,Horrific,"If I were Jane Austen, I would sue. This movie is BEYOND boring and quite frankly, a waste of the $3.99 I spent to watch it. I lacks depth and fails to give much insight into the cultures and society it attempts to portray. It's a superficial glance at the worlds of Mexican-Americans, corporate lawyers, romance, and just people in general. I urge you to save your hard-earned $$$."
1,Terrible Acting,I normally like cheesey movies but I couldn't get past the first 20 minutes of this one. The acting is terrible. Don't waste your time!
1,Really???,"Should've known better ~ the reviews made it sound like it might be that sleeping-kinda-good movie... NOT!! The make-up was awful... an obvious line across their foreheads, fake color... ewwww... not to mention the dialogue, acting... plot, ha... don't bother unless you're babysitting and want the kids to nod-off out of boredom."
3,A No Brainer,"This isn't ""mental giant"" viewing, but then, not all can be. It's a cute movie that you can watch while doing other things and still keep up. It takes no thought to watch or understand."
4,good american movie,"It was an interesting movie that we watched with the kids with the happy ending. There were a couple of unexpected themes, but basically, the ending was predictable. We did learn a little about Mexican culture."
4,Good Saturday afternoon movie,Was funny and we enjoyed it. I like that it was included for free in my Prime membership. Will be watching more Prime movies in the future.
5,Excellent Reference Tool,"As a medical transcriptionist, I need a complete and easy to use reference book....I have never found a better one. I like the way it lists the medications, their generics and what illness the medication is used for. My choice of drug books for 14 years. Do not hesitate on this one."
4,Adobable. My daughter love it,This is good DVD. My daughter loves Dora. This is cute & has lots of singing. Catchy songs that my daughter loved. But still classic Dora with all the characters you've come to know.
5,Very Charming Movie!,"Very enjoyable, charming movie starring Glenn Ford and young Ronny Howard who is seeking a new wife for his recently-widowed father. Many touching moments as well as some charming scenes. A must see movie that you will enjoy. END"
4,The Original Courtship,"The film version of The Courtship Of Eddie's Father is not as well known as the television show it spawned, but it is an enjoyable film. The film stars Glenn Ford as recently widowed New York City disk jockey who must raise his eight-year old son, Eddie played by Ron Howard. Shirley Jones co-stars as the family's next-door neighbor who develops into a love interest for Mr. Ford (this is the second film in row that Mr. Howard & Ms. Jones starred in together after 1962's The Music Man). Jerry Van Dyke provides comic relief as a fellow DJ who is the typical early 60's swinging ladies man. The film's best moments are the interaction between Mr. Ford & Mr. Howard. Their relationship is lovingly depicted and the sense of loss and coping that they go through is quite realistic. The Courtship Of Eddie's Father is a good, family friendly film."
4,Victorian Rock and Roll Masterpiece,"I've always loved Kusworth. Anyone not familiar with him should probably start by picking up the albums he did with Nikki Sudden in the Jacobites. Nikki is usually the guy who gets top billing on those albums, but Kusworth's ballads shined far above most all of the other material. His rugged, beautiful voice cold carry any band out there, and it's a shame that his output hasn't been widely distributed in the U.S.Anyhow, on to the facts: This is a great non-Jacobites rock and roll album. I'd love to sit here and try to compare it to anything else out there, but you can't. Kusworth's approach to music is quite varied. If you love folky music, you'll love it. If you like ballads, you'll love it. If you like straight rock and roll, you'll definitely love it. This IS the English rock and roll!"
4,The Psalter : Psalms & Canticles for Singing,It is a beautiful book. It is better if the Optional Descant printed above the Refrain than after the verses. I expect each Psalm has its Optional Descant since my voice is suitable for Descant.
4,Great Watch,"The ONLY negative comment I have concerning this watch is the size. Were it not for that I would give it the full 5 stars, but that is simply my personal preference. It is a little large for me, though I do have a small wrist. It is not, however, too large. It is a nice looking and versatile timepiece and was very easy to set using the interactive CD that came with it. I like the colors of the roman numerals (blue) and the hands (navy). I have also heard from professionals that Citizen is a good company to deal with, particularly when compared to Seiko which does not have a good reputation."
2,Plot Overboard!,"Unless you are looking for a lame mystery which insults anyone even loosely related to the Jewish faith or the cruise industry, forget about this offering from Sharon Kahn. I do, however, give her an extra star for handling Ruby's emotional dilemma about trust and dating after widowhood in a sensitive and believable manner."
3,maybe if I'd read the previous books in the series....,"I found most of the characters in ""Don't Cry For Me Hot Pastrami"" to be one-dimensional (or worse, no dimensional, just a flat out stereotype) but maybe if I'd read the previous books in the series I'd know better who was who and what made them tick. Maybe. Ruby's narration style is abrupt and leaves a lot of what motivates her to the imagination, and the other characters are even less clear. The description of the cruise the Temple Rita group is on is unbelievable to the point that it's not really funny, people on a cruise with the food described would be performing a mutiny of epic proportions! This is all too bad, because the mystery plot is pretty good. Fortunately, the writing itself is decent, no dumb grammar or usage mistakes, just too much improbability in the setting and rather weak support on the characterization front."
1,avoid reseller dudjung,please be VERY CAREFUL ...DO NOT ORDER from reseller dudjung...he sent me a defective CD and refuses to acknowledge my emails about it...BEWARE..AVOID
3,It's alright,I bought it for a tea party in case anyone wanted to be tweedle-dee or tweedle dum. Hat fits just right on my head(I'm 25). Little spinning thing is pretty. It looks like it will spin well in the wind.
3,"Cute, but big","The hat is cute, but it is quite large. DH and I wore this for Halloween. It fit him quite well, but I needed several pins to secure it to my head. Would have liked a bit of elastic to held hold it on. Other than that, it was a great addition to our costume."
2,Not worth the money,"This is a fun and cute little hat. The spinner will bend and not spin without hitting the child's head unless it is straight. To straighten it, you need to reach under the hat and find the spot in the middle of the underneath side and try to straighten that. It is a bit on the smaller side and doesn't stay on easily. Would not recommend buying this unless you don't mind spending the money for something that won't likely stand up to repeated use."
5,Hat's Off,"This is a great book. It covers virtually the whole history of the ""modern"" game, from the early teens to (almost) the present day, and does so from the perspective of the baseball scout -- the keenest evaluators of talent in the game. Here are a series of larger-than-life characters, each with a silver tongue it seems, and an endless reservoir of anecdotes - often amusing, sometimes tragic. It is one of those books that is a pure pleasure to read and sink oneself into, filled with earthy but incisive baseball talk and analysis.This book reflects a huge amount of research, but comes across with an easygoing quality, wearing its scholarship lightly.It's unfortunate that it's out of print, and that used copies are so expensive. But if you can find one for a reasonable price you wouldn't be disappointed."
5,A masterpiece,"Dollar Sign on the Muscle belongs on any short list of the best baseball books ever written. It has the ability to change the way you look at baseball by taking you inside the fascinating world of baseball scouts and their never-ending search for the ""arm behind the barn,"" the ""good face"" and the many other phrases that you'll never forget after reading this book. Kerrane is a marvelous prose stylist but one who never draws attention to his own felicity for words -- instead, he uses that gift to effortlessly draw the reader into the scout's world (especially the bygone era of scouting before the advent of the amateur draft). I can't recommend it highly enough."
2,Can be skipped,"Let me confess that I couldn't go beyond a few chapters...this book was funny in parts but the author does not know when to stop. A hallmark of a good satire is that it must be short and this book is anything but.Am a big fan of 'English, August' and was thoroughly disappointed by this sequel. Instead of picking this, go read 'English, August' again."
5,The best (and most underated) album of 1998!,"Looking back on all the releases of 98, for me this was without a doubt the most enjoyable, most rockin' release of the year. With the exception of the song ""Back in the saddle"" (which really drags on), this album is ALL KILLER and NO FILLER.Every song is catchy, the production is excellent, the musicianship is good, great song variety, and all in all this album ROCKS!!!The highlight track for me is ""Southern Pride"" , incorporating harmonica, organ and a choir into what was possibly the song of the year.I've got friends who quickly dismissed this album, but after listening to it on and off for a year now, it's still one of the most enjoyable CDs I own.HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!"
4,Rising to the top,I was first introduced to Stuck Mojo on a certain Monday night program also. Ever since then I have been hooked on their music. It's something different and unigue. I mean whoever thought that rap and certain musical intruments would blend so well.
3,Nothing Special,This album is inferior to their previous efforts by far. Be sure to check out Pigwalk and Snappin Necks if you want the real deal. This just sounds like someone doing a bad job trying to be the Suicidal Tendencies.
1,Former fan from western Mass,"Crap, crap and more crap! if you like their old stuff dont buy this album! It will only disappointment you. If you havent checked their old stuff do it, you wont be disappointed!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I wanted a book about Southern's development and selection of motive power for freight trains in the steam era, or at least the 1900-1953 era, with a good number of pictures. I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, it is mostly just a picture book.Yes, it has some nice pictures, but it has very little real information. The specifications for each major locomotive type are repeated, almost verbatim, many times. I realize that there were minor variations, even within the same nominal class, but it would suffice to list the basics specifications once and then discuss the variations. There's very little in the way of history, development, operational characteristics, etc. Much of the text seems to be filler.If you just want pictures of a several locomotives from most of the major Southern freight classes, buy it. But if you want detailed information or in-depth analysis, look elsewhere."
1,Sorry I Bought It,"Even at close-out price this was not worth it. The stories are not sensual and don't make a whole heck of a lot of sense. In fact, they don't rate the term 'story' for the most part. Don't waste your time or your money."
1,very depressing,"I found this book to be very depressing. I got it when I just found that I was pregnant with my second and I wanted some advice and support - and it doesn't give you any. Most of information is a common knowlege, some is controversial, and what was probably intended to prepare you to all upcoming difficulties makes you think ""What the hell I was thinking that night..."".If you read something in your first pregnancy and if you have What to Expect the First year and Toddler Years (that have chapters about siblings), you already know more than this book can offer."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book in eager (happy!) anticipation of my second child. However, after only reading the first 7 pages of the book, I stopped. The Author seemed to hyper-focus on all of the negative aspects of being pregnant and took the attitude ""why would anyone ever do this again!"" I find that pretty silly and immature. You're a Mom. Being a Mom is tough. Get over it, honey.I wanted a book that talked about some serious differences between my first and second pregnancy - not a book that talked me INTO having the second one. I'm already pregnant... and HAPPY about it!If you were one of those women who complained about every aspect of being pregnant and then complained about every aspect of being a new Mom, this book is for you! You will be in good company. If you are a strong woman who is confident in your mothering skills and family planning choices, you will find this book negative, trite and immature."
1,Tell Me Something New,"I am expecting my second child in the fall, and I had really hoped to read a book that would give me practical tips on ways to prepare myself and our family. This book was just a very general conversation about things any parent would already know. I was disappointed and do not recommend the book."
3,Twice Blessed,"I picked this book because I wanted a realistic, non-chemically/hormonally driven view of what it would be like going for it one more time before my husband and I sail into that long good night.I assumed it would not really (I mean come on - my first baby is so darned adorable, I want another and ain't nothing going to change my mind!). Fooled me. I was surprised by the sound of screeching brakes in the background as I got into this book.Frank and honest to a fault, unsullied by rose colored baby glasses, a make-no-bones about it, this is what your life's going to be like book that was like a bucket of cold water in my face. If I go down a path, I want to know the worst and the best of expectations based on others who have gone before me. I know what I'll end up doing but this book is a good glimpse into the consequences of the choice my husband and I will make. Recommend it highly."
3,A bit disappointing,"As I was reading this, I kept waiting for the part where I was going to feel better about having a second child. Instead, I was laid in bed with eyes wide open. It seemed to be all truthful, but I was looking to set my mind at ease and it never happen."
5,Great book when expecting your second child.,"This is such a good book. For anyone expecting their second child, it really provides insight and advice. Highly recommend it."
4,Good book for considering second child,"This book takes an honest look at adding to your family. It's an easy read which is important when looking after even one child, time is short! Most of the advice is for preparing your child and marriage for the arrival of a new family member. It is a bit short on sibling issues, but I will get another book for that. Overall, I recommend this book and would buy again."
5,"Walk, Don""t Run","Delightful comedy starring Cary Grant, as Sir Rutland, who travels to Tokyo, only to find that he has no where to stay due to the Olympics being there; manages to share an apartment with Christine Easton, (played by Samantha Eggar). He further complicates the arrangements when he invites Steve Davis, (played by Jim Hutton) who is a member of the Olympic team. Grant with his subtle, charming mannerisms has solutions to all problems that he creates for the three of them. Saw this as a teenager; loved it then and still do."
4,Great for everyone,"Funny, smart, a picture into the era and a great remake of a classic. The original - The More the Merrier - was wonderful, but this is a great update of that story. The more I have watched it the better it gets, especially the dialog between Steve (Jim Hutton) and William (Cary Grant).It does take you back to the 60's and gives you a look at that time, but the humor is timeless."
4,check out the original,"This movie is very funny, and I love love love Cary Grant, but you should also check out the original called The More the Merrier. It seems to be lesser known, but it's even better than this one, and it stars one of Grant's previous costars Jean Arthur (from Only Angels Have Wings and The Talk of the Town), the handsome Joel McCrea, and Charles Coburn. Coburn is great as the ""silly old man"" type, and Jean Arthur's explosive crying is hilarious. It's black and white, which I know turns some people off, but I promise, if you liked Walked Don't Run you'll enjoy The More the Merrier.The More the Merrier"
5,Unexpectedly Hilarious,"Walk, Don't Run was a delightful surprise. It was Cary Grant's last movie, in which he proves that he's not only gorgeous and charming, but also a king of comedy. Whether searching for a pair of elusive pants, playing with an ubiquitous couple of Japanese children, or ""dropping by"" one of the Olympic races, there's no one funnier than him. A very good movie and an unforgettable star."
4,When will this great comedy be released on DVD?,"On of my favorites films, using a wide asortment of comedy techniques, that's sure to entertain you. What a way for Cary Grant to close his film career!"
5,Baby Boomer's Classic,For the baby boomer this is a classic. Cary Grant is suave and comical in this 60's movie. I grew up watching this movie with my sibs. The TV network must of showed it often because it became a popular favorite with our generation. This movie is entertaining without the harsh languages or violence of today's movies. Very sweet movie.
5,Fantastic,My grandson received a barn for his birthday and needed animals. The animals are great quality and he really enjoys them. I didn't like the way the ordering turned out. They came from different sellers so arrived sporadically so watch for that.
4,"A good figurine, but the dimensions in the description are off","A well made product, but the product size is misleading. I was looking for something that was under 1"", and the description of this product said that it was. And it is, but only at the base. From nose to tail it is definitely more than 1""."
2,Will stick to less expensive pots that don't stick,"We were really impressed with the things we read about All-Clad but now that we've purchased three expensive pieces we are disappointed. Why do I keep saying ""we"" when I'm the only one who cooks?? Anyway, the pots are too heavy, the handles are hard to use due to being so long and thin and offer little help whie trying to fill the heavy pot with water. Also, so many recipes call for non-stick surfaces that I'm leary of using the fry pan for frying!! My thick old Purdential set of pots is about fifty years old and all but one pot are still in great shape."
1,too heavy,"product too heavy to use for pasta, etc. the pan is too heavy so after you put in water it is almost impossible to lift off the stove because it is weighted all wrong. also the company thru amazon that I bought it from was terrible so I was not able to return it since they never sent me the information for returning it. terrible purchase."
5,for the young at heart,"A wonderful book, and not just for children! Charming illustrations by several artists and 70 beautiful prayers from around the world. Anyone interested in spirituality should love this book."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a fabulous book that shares spiritual words from many worldwide religions and uses beautiful illustrations to accompany them! As a person who embraces different aspects of many religions, I found this to be a valuable resource for teaching my child. And after reading the book, you get a sense of how all religions are very similar and striving for the same things - peace and harmony with all that is around us and with our Higher Power."
3,Skimming the surface,"As a student, I am hungry for a richer and more clearly explained method of working with the calendar(s) within the context of TCM. I was hoping this text would provide me with simple, clear and full explanations of astrological acupuncture. Instead, I am left with a taste and the hope for fulfillment of my wish elsewhere.I did find myself enjoying the list of Taoist Chinese Medical contributors as it was a lovely historical remembrance and a deepening of my respect for the elders and ancestors of this healing path.I would not recommend this text unless you have no information regarding Taoist applications used in Chinese Medicine. Otherwise, it will be redundant, as it was for me, a third-year Acupuncture student."
5,The good and bad girl,"I love these bratz!!!They are soo cute,I have them,but I love Pheobe the most.Roxxi is also cool.The themes of good and bad girl are cool.Pheobe comes with light blue capris with diamond decals,a pink faux fur jacket,a pink angel shirt,a pink purse,black high heels,make-up, angel keychain,pink and black striped one sleeve shirt,and earringsRoxxi comes with ripped jeans,a leather jacket,a red devil shirt,black high heels,red and black striped one sleeve shirt,earrings,black purse,make-up,and a devil keychain"
4,A Very Nice Collector's Addition!,"I've been collecting dolls for a while, and just began collecting Bratz this year. The Twiins are very nice. They are a nice theme that no other company has come up with. (as far as I know). They will also be a hard one to mimic, if Mattel's My Scene's come out with one, it will be blatantly copying. They are both much more beautiful than they look in the box. I highly recommend this, for a child or a collector. I've decided this will be my last Bratz, though, because of the prices. $35? Ouch. If you want the cuteness, but also want to be economical, collect or play with the My Scene. They do not come with as much stuff, or quality stuff (i.e. you can't put stuff in the purses...) but still, they are a lovely fashion doll and are very durable. However, I've learned you just can't beat the Bratz if you're wanting a pretty, collectible fashion doll. Highly recommended."
5,Phoebe and Roxxi Rock!!!,"I recieved Phoebe and Roxxi for my eleventh birthday and I was extremely pleased with them. The keychains that are included with them are very cute. They are definitely worth the money you pay for them. Along with being extremely durable and lots of fun, they teach you that you can have your own style and attitude, and you shouldn't care what other people think of you. Both phoebe and Roxxi have beautiful, soft , long hair. You can keep your Bratz in perfect condition by combing their hair regularly, being gentle with them, and storing them in a safe place where your younger siblings(If you have any) can't reach them. I cannot wait until the new twins, ""Orianna and Valentina"" are released in stores. You can see them, along with all the other Bratz to be released in Fall/Winter 2005 on www.mgae.com! I hope my review helps!!!"

1,unite,"Bratz haters, we are being challenged by dumb***, retarded bratz slaves. We will show those bratz-obessed idiots who REALLY ARE the great dolls: My scene. They really rock!!!! And who would want a snobby doll with a swollen head, teeny tiny anorexic bodies, and evil Satanic style??? FIGHT, FELLOW HATERS"
3,That's odd,I was watching a commercial for this toy. And then my brother (Who was watching it with me) said he heard a swear (He did'nt know which one) in the background. Is it a subiminal? I don't know.
2,Big Letdown,"Although, I think these dolls look like little tarts, my daughter begged for them so I relented. She seems happy enough with them...but their feet keep falling off and they are extremely difficult to put the tops/jackets on. With the fingers on the hand jutting out, the pink furry one is impossible to put on the doll. A grand waste of money."
5,twiinz rock!,my brother got these for me! they are great i love them so much!2 twiinz2 collectible key chains1 poster2 glasses and more!10/10 for these twiinz spectacular!
1,GET BARBIE TWINS!!!,"Honestly, Bratz copied BARBIES ideas of twins. Bratz rwiins are tacky hoochies but Barbie twins are loyal and loving! Barbie rules and always will! My brother hates Bratz too! Not all girls like Bratz! Most of them like BARBIE!BARBIE DECLARES VICTORY!"
1,SHUT UP,"I can post my own opinions. You are a BRATZ slave, that's 4 sure! Why don't you kiss and marry BRATZ you B***h."
1,BRATZ.... suck,"Why are BRATZ bad?*The BRATZ WORLD series offends other cultures.*BRATZ teaches girls that fashion is your only true friend.*The BRATZ movie was superficial and annoying.*BRATZ SPORTZ says on the back of the box: ""It's not about how you play, it's about how hot you look when you win""* BRATZ BABYZ all look MUCH older than a baby should.*The Valintine's day box says: ""Celebrating their ONLY true love... FASHION!Hope that changed your mind."
5,Cool or what????????????????????????????????????????????????,This toy so (...) diserves 5 stars i mean truely this is so (...) comin from my heart these dolls are amazing fun you can play with them until you get board but you know what it is so awesome and so much fun to play with that i don't think that you will get board. Now you should so buy these dolls roxxi and phoebe are the best and i hope that this reivew was great and enjoyable and most of all i just hope who ever reads this will love and buy the dolls!!!! I am a total bratz lover! Good night everbody!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Feeling and groove from Brasil !!!!,"This album captures the jamaican irie feeling mixing with brazilian reality and critics to social system and its problems. Great lyrics and powerfull vocal from ""Dionísio"" are the main points. Tracks with feeling like ""Bom Dia Jamaica"", ""Reggae Paradise"" and social problems on ""Negritude Gato"" and ""Nao"" are my favorite ones!!"
2,Conference Proceedings,"`Epicurus: His Continuing Influence and Contemporary Relevance', is a brief anthology of essays stemming from papers presented at the 2002 Rochester Institute of Technology Conference of the same name.The essays are in large-part centered on rather narrow and niche topics such as; the relationship between Pierce's ethics and Epicurean thought, Marx and ancient Greek atomic theory, the inscriptions at Oenoanda, etc. While not entirely uninteresting, the contributions are of modest quality and are probably only of interest to a very limited academic audience.Overall, while these types of texts provide an excellent opportunity for lesser known academics to publish and gain exposure, they often have little appeal to a broader audience. Readers looking for a broad discussion of Epicurean thought would be best served looking elsewhere."
3,"Interesting, but not exactly what I was looking for","This book is a series of academic essays of current scholarship surrounding Epicurus. My hope in purchasing it was to get a better sense of what Epicurus is saying in his (surviving) works. I did get that to some extent, but mostly indirectly, in that an understanding of Epicurus is partially assumed by most of the essays and their main points are more technical and less general. For example, two of the essays focus on the question of how friends/friendship can be an end in itself if your philosophy is hedonism (pleasure for one's self). And several of the essays compare Epicurus in relatively obscure details to other philosophers. Nevertheless I did learn a fair amount about current interpretations of Epicurus' philosophy."
3,"Not Bad for the beginner, but not too good either","This book is fair for the beginner; it does teach some easy sleights and vanishes. For those who may be starting out in magic but are fairly serious about it, Modern Coin Magic is a much better value."
4,Really impressive for something that is essentially unprovable conjecture,"An intriguing premise, Freud uses his theory about the origin of Judaism as a way of showing how his conception of the consciousness can be transferred to humanity, writ large. Historically, it seems far fetched (which he openly acknowledges), but what Freud really succeeds at here is showing how any attempt to really examine the history of a major abrahamic religious figure means reassessing a great deal of what we think about how monotheistic religion works and how its developed since it first came about. I was confused by some of his terminology, but overall, I found it to be a fairly easy read."
4,fascinating but very speculative,"This is a fairly obscure and especially speculative work of Freud's, published originally in the year he died. The argument is fascinating. Its exposition, however, (as Freud himself concedes within it) is repetitive and at times tedious. There were two particular sticking points for me: 1) It assumes one has read Freud's ""Totem and Taboo"" (I hadn't). 2) The larger argument is contigent on (extra-somatic) racial memory, a biological impossibility. Defending this notion Freud makes several remarks that tarnish his philosophy and psychology as a whole, and this is unfortunate.I'd prefer you read Freud's ""The Question of Lay Analysis"" (a lucid and engaging account of the basic tenets of psychoanalysis), his ""Civilization and its Discontents"", and his ""The Future of an Illusion"". (And while I'm recommending things, there is also, for musicians, ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"" by Jeff Burns."
2,A violent book,"This book contains much violent material and may not be suitable for children. Monkey King, an impulsive supernatural being on a quest for some Buddhist Sutra texts, thinks nothing of killing whole groups of people on a single occasion. Here's a quote: ""Why would I want to eat a baby? It's not even a time of famine."""
4,Great Teaching Tool,I use these DVD's to help put Shakespeare into perspective with my theatre classes. This fast-paced humorous approach gets the information across and the students enjoy watching the MTV style.
3,Entertaining,"An odd one, this. Members of Redd Kross, White Flag, and other L.A. scensters pay homage to various Beatles tracks... the results are both funny and melodic. As the 'track listing' on this page would indicate, the actual track-listing on the CD is all-over the place. Worth checking-out for Redd Kross fans."
4,telling anecdotes,"The authors give insightful explanations of many government subsidies that ultimately act to create waste and, often, lobbying for more subsidies to remediate the effects of the first. Nothing in the book is particularly new. But it brings together many details often omitted in shorter explanations.Apart from the many tables of numerical data, the book also has telling anecdotes. One is how in the California Central Valley, overhead irrigation is often done at midday, when the temperature might be over 30, or even over 40. Likewise, in Cairo during an international conference, the lawns were watered at such times, in similar temperatures. A dreadful waste. Often, half the water is lost to evaporation. Yet in both countries, government subsidised water is so cheap that profligate use is encouraged."
5,MEMORABLE AND HONORED TO HAVE MET HIM!!!,"I truly enjoyed the book! I met MSG Roy P. Benavidez in 1990 while stationed in the Air Force at Dyess AFB in Abilene, Texas. The book is a must to read. It's an inspiration to all mankind. Unfortunately, on 11-30-98, he passed away. I attended his funeral services along with hundreds to pay our respects to a man whom I met in my lifetime and will never forget. The book has been written. Now, the movie must be made..."
2,"Sent me the wrong book, but I'll give it away to someone.","I really wanted Benavides' book. I met him and loved his stories. He made me laugh, he made me cry. What an incredible man.BUT you sent me the wrong book! Grrrrr!I'll give it to a retired Air Force general, and I know he'll like it.AND I still want that book.I will look elsewhere.If it is out of print, maybe you could have told me that instead of sending me the wrong book."
4,worth reading,Good story of courage and deternination to succeed. An inspiration to everyone that reads it.
2,SD7500 PHONE SYSTEM,"I like the features this phone system has with blue tooth cability to place and receive calls from you cell. Also the ability to get notifications if someone calls and leaves a message on the phone and then the phone with call you anywhere you have programmed to review you answer machine. Now the downfall, the blue tooth feature is great but drops you in the middle of a call with no reason. Also the battery life is a joke, if you get the phone with the non-color display the battery last maybe 40 minutes talk, and thats after lifting it off the charging stand. The Color display, well you might as well limit you call to half that. And I even bought differnt rechargable batteries (Energizers) with the listed talk times. I thought when buying Motorola I was buying quality. The Cell phones I don't have problems."
4,Nice smelling!,"I'm satisfied with the smell ,very fresh & good for everyday use.It quickly disappear though but if you put it a bit on your clothes it stay longer than in your skin ,otherwise I enjoyed it as well as for the great price!"
4,Nice Smell,"Nice smell,however you need about 12 to 15 sprays to keep the aroma on you all day. I would have given this 5 stars,only if they improve on the chemical that would require less sprays."
1,I think I got a fake,I don't know weather to trust amazon anymore with perfumes and cologne. I bought nautica twice and they were genuine and smelled great. I ordered this thinking it would be good plus it had so many good reviews. But I got ripped off. I don't think I'll ever buy cologne from amazon ever...
1,Fake!,"I wanted to give this cologne to my brother as a gift, and received a fake Ferrari cologne! It rotted (started to stink) in a few weeks! I am surprised that it is sold by AMAZON.COM LLC.....I"
4,"Yes, you should","I have gotten numerous compliments on this eau de toilette. It has a light, almost woodsy smell. Reminds me of a laid back saturday at the country club or something. Classy yet sporting."
4,smells good,smells good...got it for a good price...would recommend if you get it for a reasonable amount
2,i got,i chose this product beacuse of a recommendationi also like the smell but the product i received doesnt smell the way i expectedi dont like it doesnt even lastdoesnt seem to be an original product
4,worth your money,"Hi Guys,I bought GUCCI perfume for $88, I thought it would be good long lasting. But I was not satisfied with it and than I bought this product. Long lasting and very nice flavor. I wear it everyday and I liked it. I can sense it even after 5 - 6 hours.I would recommend it, and rate it better than GUCCI perfumes."
4,helpful,"For a teacher who hasn't much time for useless reading, this was a quick, easy, helpful read to help manage paper grading. I have used much of the advice and it has made life with essays less stressful. It was also encouraging as the author was honest and open about the second thoughts we all have about teaching, wondering whether what we do is all worth it. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is."
2,Leaves much to be desired.,"I've been a huge fan of the Sylvers since their 70's hey-day. The material here isn't bad. Not by any stretch. But this is the FOURTH Sylvers compilation to be released in the last ten years or so and they all seem to have the same tired songs on them.Perhaps it has something to do with licensing, but there are significant Sylvers tunes that have been left off these hits packages.Just last night I dug out 1978's ""Forever Yours"" album and put it on the turntable. The title track and ""Swept For You Baby"" (written by Smokey Robinson) should be included on any true greatest hits package. (I remember the songs getting some airplay in Chicago that year!)With the exception of ""Don't Stop, Get Off,"" this most excellent Sylvers album is generally overlooked with each compilation CD. I don't mind ""The Roulette Wheel of Love"" and ""Ain't No Doubt About It,"" but come on! Let's delve a little deeper into this family's catalog and give us fans something more!"
3,big fan of the Sylvers which for a Box-Set,I've always dug the Sylvers&wished the Record Company would drop a Full Box Set on them.a Very Talented Musical Family.Leon Sylvers went on to Become one of the Baddest Producers in the Biz.I like the Cuts here but hope one day for more than the Usual fare that is released from them.
5,Our herb garden references,"As part of our on-going learning about how to grow and use herbs in cooking, canning, and teas, we bought this book. It is an excellent cross-reference manual, augmenting or contrasting nicely our other books."
1,"Herbs, etc",Not relevant to my needs. This is a book written at the beginning of the 1900' s - I was looking for something much more current.
5,Stunning,"The best movie about HH XVI Karmapa on the market, full recommendation for everyone - buddhists and non-buddhists."
5,Dharma King Visits America,"His Holiness Rangjung Rikpe Dorje, the sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa, supreme head of the Karna Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism performed the Vajra Crown ceremony publicly in Burlington, VT during the late 1970s. I was one who attended this extraordinary Empowerment. This film captures the essence of His Holiness' stunning presence."
3,Man people lighten up.,"So it lacked in plot and character developement. These guys simply ran out of money. Anyway the opening sequence you can't deny was chilling. This is also semi-based on a true story, and it has great special effects. Definetly a must see for die hard horror fans. This is a decent movie. It wasn't terrible, but to jaded horror fans, I'd suggest seeing The Ring instead, but to people that just watch horror films every now and then, this is the one for you."
1,One of the worst horror films of 2003,Darkness Falls is a film I skipped seeing in the theater because honestly horror films like this shouldn't be rated PG-13 as a matter of act they should go staright to video. I rented this video hoping for a good horror film but alas I was upset. The lead actor Chaney Kley gives a terrible peformance but the worst performance comes from Lee Cormie I was wishing the whole movie that he would bite the dust. The only thing that makes the film worth viewing is hottie Emma Caulfield other wise skip this one.
1,SUCKS,"This movie really sucks because, first off, who would really name a town DARKNESS FALLS? This movie did not scare me, really, it does not""circle around The Ring."" The Ring was so much scarier than this hunk of crap. It's obvious what will happen next. Seriously, Scream scared me more than this. What's your problem? People who think this movie sucks, you better be reading this. Sign up on Amazon and say how much this movie sucks compared to a piece of crap.This movie was totally pathetic, it's screwed, wrong, and not scary. Even when someone rings the doorbell, surprises me more than this movie. Thank god I watched it on Movie Central, or I would have wasted $9.99!"
2,1.5 Stars,"Darkness Falls is a monotynus, random, incoherent, and stupid movie. It's not scary, it has terrible acting, plot stinks, pacing stinks, almost everything about this ""movie"" is bad! Don't waste your time with this load of crud, it's a waste of time and money. The only remotely entertaining thing in this ""film"" is that the Toothfairy is the killer. Othere than that, this is a lame excuse for a movie!"
1,dont waste your money on this flick,"it was cheap, disapointing and not scary at all. i'll give it a good pointer, there were a couple parts that were starteling, but not scary. dont waste your time"
2,You will pay for tooth decay,"No molar is safe. The tooth fairy is coming for your soul...BWAHAHAHAH!!!! Aquafresh will not save you!Yeah, this is as ridiculous as it sounds. A demonic creature comes to collect its prize while the youth are sleeping. But this demented fairy gets infuriated when it finds out that little kids don't have grillz?!? The little buggers keep sticking rotten little baby teeth under their pillow, which have no trade in value at the pawn shop. WTF?I kept expecting this to be a movie about bad dreams or mentally deranged children or something. But no, it really is about a tooth fairy (sigh). In all fairness, this was the best tooth fairy movie I have ever seen."
3,Good Start...Bad Finish,"Darkness Falls is a horror movie directed by Jonathan Liebesman. It is a dark take on the story of the tooth fairy. The movie started breathtakingly with sheer terror...but fell off as it went on.The movie did start out great however. Chaney Kley plays the older Kyle, the boy who originally saw the tooth fairy. Years later, a friend's (Emma Caulfield) younger brother has also seen the tooth fairy and it's up to him to protect the boy.The DVD includes both the Widescreen and Full Screen Versions of the film, which is always a delight to have for those anti-widescreen folks out there.It includes two audio commentaries, a ""Making Of"" featurette, The Legend of Matilda Dixon featurette, and a number of deleted scenes, including an alternate ending.This DVD still gets a solid recommendation from me, for those of you who are fans of horror movies."
4,kinda scary,There are parts of this movie that are pretty freaky and scary. I know it got some bad reviews but I have watched it more than once and like it!
2,"Just another horror movie, not so bad !","Not the worst I have ever seen, but not the best. You don't have to wait half an hour to get into action. The movie itself last an hour and fifteen minutes ...On a good home cinema, I must say that the sound is pretty good, prepare yourself to jump a few times ! The filmmakers had succeed in creating a tension that is almost omni-present. Not that bad but not a masterpiece to add to your DVD collection eighter."
5,DARKNESS FALLS IS ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FLICKS OUT THERE!!!!!!,Darkness Falls is one of the best horror flicks out there and it has its jolts and chills within the movie!!!!!! A tooth fairy witch is out to kill everyone in Darkness Falls!!!!! The only way to stay alive is to be in light and you have to stay out of darkness!!!!!!! If you want a really good scary movie then go check out this movie!!!!!!
5,"GREAT, SUSPENSEFUL","The movie was very suspenseful, scary but not gross, I've watched it numerous times since I purchased."
1,Scary to think it was called scary,"One word.......HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope you don't waste your money on this worthless peice of junk. It is not scary. It gets so old when the stupid ""Tooth Fairy"" does the same thing over and over again! She kills people in the dark and that is the whole stupid movie. It is barely over an hour. Only 75 mins. It is a disgrace to mankind. Who ever thought of this movie should be put in jail! Don't Buy this. I beg of you.......................Save your money for halloween or an actual scary move. It is so bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,In Sheer terror it raps rings around the ring.,TALK ABOUT FALSE ADVERTISING! The only scary part was the beggining and that was it. The rest of the movie was cliche after cliche! If you want true terror see the ring or the exorcist.
1,'Darkness' Falls,"This movie was a crime. I never saw The Tooth Fairy when I put my teeth under the pillow. I got cash, not chocolate coins. Aren't those bad for your teeth anyway? How can a kid pull his tooth out in a public restroom? That's filthy. Well anyway, in the town of ""Darkness Falls,"" an evil grandmother likes to terrorize little children and get rid of anyone who looks at her. Yeah, I'd wear a mask too if I was that hideous. The first ten minutes are pretty spooky, but once the kids grew up and became even more inept adults, the film fell short of being just alright. What a terrible movie. Watch ""The Ring"" instead if you want a good jolt."
2,We should be safe here,"How many times in this movie did a minor character say the words ""We should be safe here"" about 1 second before he or she is wisked away by the 'tooth fairy'? At least 6 times and it became so tiresome to hear that line and know what was coming before he or she finished speaking. This movie stunk. I gave it 2 stars because the 'tooth fairy' was something of a well done evil creature. None of the main characters had any redeeming value."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I had low expectations, but was still disappointed.Competent acting and direction can't save a derivative script. These guys aren't writers; they're Hollywood cut-and-pasters. There's no plot to speak of. No surprises, no reversals, no revelations. Not a scintilla of inspiration.If you waste your time on this one, you'll feel bored and cheated."
1,Darkness Falls DVD,I love the movie Darkness Falls so much I bought this copy for myself and another for my cousin (who also loves horror movies). Unfortunately I've never been able to watch this DVD. When I put it in my DVD player I received an error message telling me it couldn't be played. I switched it to another player and received the same message. I don't know if this copy is just a bad copy or what's wrong with it but I won't buy another DVD from this supplier again.
4,The punkrockerkasumi chick,"OMG, this movie is very suspensful and frightening. I just saw it and i nearly wet my pants. I stayed up all night and clung to every friend i had at school the next day. It's about a boy whos mother was killed by a woman who is like the toothfairy but if you look at her hideous face she kills you when the lights go out. The freakiest part is a kid saw her and 12 years later she's still after him. I couldn't calm down and the little kid is a good actor because nowadays most child actors in horror movies just plain suck. Anyways I recommend this and if you don't watch it then you just killing yourself inside. Mwahahahah!"
4,A NICE LITTLE CREEPER,"If you're looking for lotsa' gore, gratuitous sex scenes, and the usual cliches that seem to drive the so-called plots of most horror movies don't bother watching DARKNESS FALLS. There are some nice thrills, plenty of atmosphere, and some genuinely decent acting by the leads. Liebesman did a good job pacing the movie as well. It's certainly not in the league of CARRIE, HOLLOWEEN, or THE EXORCIST, but it's far from boring."
3,Not So Bad......................,"For being rated PG-13, I thought this movie was fairly good. It's a thrilling movie filled with alot of suspense when Kyle returns to Darkness Falls after many years. When he was young, he saw the ""tooth fairy"" . We find out that this ""tooth fairy"" is the ghost of a woman who many years ago was hung and before dying, she put a curse on the whole town. It goes like this....after ""darkness falls"", any child who sees her ends up dead! Kyle must figure out how to destroy the tooth fairy ghost before she claims more victims. Her fear........Light. Good suspense film. I'd recommend suspense/thriller movie fans who have not seen this film yet, to rent it."
2,Stay in the car (oops) stay in the light,"Yep it is your standard ""if you do not believe me you're dead"" story.A nasty spirit poses as the tooth fairy. A complete series of situations where two people Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley), and Michael Greene (Lee Cormie) that saw the fake fairy and are going to get theirs; in the mean time there is lots of collateral damage to friends and foes alike. Not much more to it. Do not expect any originality or plot twists.Weird Science - The Complete Seasons 1 & 2 ~ Emma Caulfield"
2,Don't watch if you want to be scared....,"To me the only thing that made this movie worthwhile was the CGI 'Toothfairy'. While there are some moments that will make you jump, you spend a lot of time rolling your eyes at the too numerous to count ""Stay in the light!!"" references. First off, the age differences in the children she's attacking is amazing. There's a 12 year old and a, um, 7 year old both losing their last tooth......O...K...... Then, they introduce characters into the story but don't reveal their names, plot devices, importance until 15-20 minutes later. You miss the scarier stuff trying to figure out who the latest idiot is. All in all, DON'T buy the DVD, you'll hate yourself in the morning. But it's worth a rent as long as you don't like movies to make you think."
2,Not As Good As I Thought It Would Be!,"A reviewer recommended this movie, as 5 stars so I thought it would be pretty good. It was predictable and the acting and special effects could have been better. It had a lot of potential since it was based loosely on a true story. It did make me jump a few times, but not enough to make renting it worthwhile."
1,Ugh,"I was excited to see this movie after seeing Donnie Darko and The Ring recently. The movie started out great, then quickly turned into a boring made-for-TV movie. Very disappointing.It's so bad that it's not even worth writing a review."
2,Darkness Falls with a wimper,"Although not as bad as it could have been, ""Darkness Falls"" is most certainly not as good as it could have been. As directed by Johnathan Liebesman, we are served a non-stop plethora of rapid fire editing and gloomy visuals. While the idea is generally creepy, and the Tooth Fairy is quite scary to look at, we never really get to see the ghostly apparition because of the dark settings. The problem is simple, since ""Darkness Falls"" is like the billionth horror movie to be released in the last 10 years, the visuals are usually their saving grace. I'm sure the visuals are there, but the darkness that falls over this film won't allow us to see them."
2,Meh,"If this movie made anyone jump, then please stick to Disney movies. Again, this was more cheesy than scary. The tooth fairy appeared way to often , and snatched people so quick that I lost count.This would be an ok film, for an amateur director, someone out of college maybe, but not a hollywood production.The only thing that I liked was the beginning, after that it gold old, really fast.Very predictable all the way through."
1,My choice for worst horror movie.,"I like good horror movies. This is not one of them, however. It highlights pretty much all that is an insult to our intelligence in American horror films. Predictable, full of cliches, and often just plain dumb. Skip this one."
3,tooth fairy reeks havoc!,"A phantom who takes the last baby tooth of every child in the town....and if you make the mistake of peeking at her, you're doomed!There are only two good things about this movie:1. Plot -A demented tooth fairy out for blood!2. The mask worn by the demented tooth fairy.I loved the idea of taking such a pleasant child hood tale and twisting it into a demented story, but the movie itself was bland. It might have been a bit better if they expanded to it cover more victims....and not had her only chasing a small group of boring people. It almost seemed beneath her to keep chasing the older guy. I kept thinking, ""Just kill him and be done with it already! There are so many more people to terrorize."""
2,Tooth Fairy Strikes Out...,"In the small town of Darkness Falls looms a Tooth Fairy legend where young children who lose their last milk tooth and peek at the Tooth Fairy will be killed by her. Kyle Walsh loses his tooth and during the night finds himself being haunted by the Tooth Fairy, whom Kyle glances at over his bed sheet. The Tooth Fairy attacks Kyle who escapes, but Kyle's mother is less fortunate. Years later, when Kyle has grown up, the Tooth Fairy seems to stalk another young boy and now Kyle has the opportunity to face his fear in the town of Darkness Falls. Darkness Falls begins with an interesting and haunting premise, however, after several turns and bends in the story the overall experience becomes a farce and not a true horror film. There are occasions where the audience will feel frightened and get startled, but the film becomes a repeated failure to its own demise through the overkill of attempting to scare the audience and the obvious use of elements of past horror films."
1,TERRIBLE,This movie was so terrible. The idea for the movie is actually retty good but the special efects and plot are terrible. Don't see it.
1,Darkness fails...,"Goooosh, I think the Golden Raspeberry should creat a new category: ""Worst Horror Movie"".This movie trespassed all the barriers of the mediocre and badly executed movies: acting, directing, screenplay, suspense... nothing, absolutely NOTHING works here... It's amazing. It's not even in the category ""so bad it's fun"". No. It's just bad."
2,"Another failed attempt of Hollywood ""Horror"".","First they try and make pinnocho into a horror story, now the tooth fairy...This movie is the reason I avoid mainstream horror flicks. enough said."
2,Super Cheesy,This movie started off creepy and then just went down hill from there. This flying masked ghost that looks like one of those Halloween monsters you hang from your tree flys around killing people. BUT you can stop it with a flashlight! Totally horrible.
2,Dullness Falls...,"I don't know what it is that drives hollywood to crank out movies like this. Well, okay, it has something to do w/ corporations making zillions of dollars on whatever they decide we ""must"" see, but I digress. DARKNESS FALLS is another generic spooker that starts out fairly cool, then descends quickly into re-tread territory. It could have been a very original ghost story w/ a terrifying ghoul. Instead, it's a kid-vid w/ a few ""bad"" words and some minor blood tossed in. I have seen some well-made PG-13 movies (The Ring, The Grudge, Disturbia, etc.). DARKNESS FALLS was a bland movie that I wanted to enjoy. Alas, I didn't..."
1,Cliches after cliches,"All the cliches are in it..even the black cat ! The story is nothing else than kind of Jeepers Creepers .. It's even laughable ! Nothing really new in this flick. It's boring and you know easy what it will happen next one more time. A pity ..The beginning, the 5 first minutes are cool."
3,A life for a tooth?,"So what ever happened with the nice little tooth fairy that is suppose to leave you money not kill you if you see her? this movie scared me and my friends out of the party at another friends house because all they have there is those glow stick thingy's. Half of my friends are sleeping with nightlights still. So the tooth fairy cursed the town and kills who ever she see's and goes to another house why dosen't she just get a better job. Kyle Walsh must have fun in that jail cell because that is where he is most of the movie instead of with ""Cat"" and her brother who has also seen the toothfairy. All I have to say to them is KEEP YOUR DAMN EYES CLOSED! tsk tsk tsk. The plot was ok and the acting was great but the special effects were dull."
1,Really Awful,"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a big horror movie fan and I was laughing at this movie. You know it is a really bad movie when you begin to desperately wish the main characters will hurry up and die. The acting is bad. The script is poorly written. The sound effects sound like the ""tooth fairy"" is congested. I just kept wishing someone would offer her cough medicine so she would shut-up and kill the rest of the cast. Don't go see this. Wait until it is out on video, watch it with your friends, and have a good laugh."
3,It's better than Scream!,"The January doldrums just keep on trucking with this tedious [horible] flick that enjoyed a surprisingly successful opening weekend, but will probably be gathering dust on the shelves of your local Blockbuster come spring. A young boy claims to have awakened from a sound sleep to see the Tooth Fairy--trying to kill him. Years later he returns to confront his troubled past and save his hometown from an unrelenting evil that has plagued it for over a century... The story is completely hokey and sparse on details, but it is guaranteed to scare...anyone--even the most faithful horror aficionados..."
3,darkness falls,"i first saw DARKNESS FALLS in the theater with two of my friends. We were a little scared at the beginning. but as the story unfolded, it got more and more predictable. it was so predictable by the end that we all decided on how it would end and what order the nurses would die in.but then, yesterday, i rented it just to make fun of it. i watched it and i watched it straight through. i stll lauged at all the parts that were predictable, but it wasn't half bad. i almost considered buying it. but thn i got over m urge, and i realized that it wasn't worth it. the special features are good."
2,Darkness Falls Falls in almost every place,"Now,don't get me wrong here,i thought this movie wasn't so bad,but it's just...another generic,tasteless today's scary Kubric wanabe films!The plot,let's face it,stinks,after the kid loosing a tooth,at night,come a simple,generic monster with a mask after people that can't see the light?????Gimme a break,as generic as possible!But,that's not only that!The worst part,actually,is in the final part of the movie when the guy is about to be eaten by the demon in the lighthouse, WHEN HE PUTS DOWN HIS ARM ON FIRE WITHOUT SUFFERING AND PUNCH THE MONSTER!!!!!COMMON,THE GUY SHOULD GET THE ARM BURNED!THAT WAS STUPID!!Go watch another horror movie ."
1,So this is better scarier than The Ring? Yea right!,"I'm sorry to all the Darkness Falls fans, but I was laughing at how bad this movie was. I mean, I've seen scarier things under my bed! Everyone kept saying how creepy her face looked... the Orcs faces on Lord of the Rings are scarier (which aren't even scary!). The acting isn't all that bad but the consept is kinda stupid and it's so predictible. The Ring scared the crap out of me, literally, so if you say that Darkness Falls is scarier, you can't decipher scary from comedy."
2,"Clever, but a real waste of time","After the first 20 minuets of Darkness Falls, you'll never want to be in the dark again. However, this film really loses its at-first cleverness for the rest of the movie, and nothing exciting really happens, thanks to [weak]acting, no plot, a draggy chase sequence for 50 minutes, and a total of 75 minutes in length (what can you do with that?). The Ring of 2002 is way scarier and is a much better movie all in all with the most clever writing in a horror movie since the sixth sense. Darkness however, needed more time for writing, much better actors, a plot, and atleast 100 minutes in length. However, for anybody whose in the mood for some chills and thrills and hasn't got anything better to do, this film's a keeper."
1,How anyone can praise this movie is beyond me.,"This movie is awful. If you're a horror fan, I suggest staying away from this truly gawd awful film. This movie is not scary. This movie is not horrifying. It is predictable, has one of the worst plots, and is not worth the film it is printed on. Stay away at all costs. Later... much later for this one."
2,Darkness falls short,"Darkness falls' whole story rests on the fact that at one time in our life (preferab;y childhood) we were afraid of the dark. The Idea is a beautifully told urban legend. The story in the beginning was great. The general idea of an kindly old woman exchanging teeth for coins in the 1800s is good. But one day she falls victim to a fire, which severely burns her face so She begins to wear a mask. One day, when children mysteriosuly disappear she is blamed and is executed. Now she returns to collect teeth in revenge and spite. Any child that looks at her face dies. This story was good. Then something went wrong. The movie's main character was introduced. We learned that as a grown man he was still afraid of the dark. The movie virtually fell apart. It was not scary at all. It was sad. They truly ruined this. They didn't take advantage of it."
2,begins well then thins out and goes dull,a horror movie like this didnt give me the creeps at all. I saw it because of the beautiful Emma Caulfield and Mr. Chaney Kley who both were in tv's buffy together. the ending is really the stupidest part with the tooth fairy showing her face and it let all the suspense drop. I really wasnt thrilled with this. it shouldve been a lot more scarier and they shouldve gaving it a R rating. the beginning starts off well and then in the middle it wears thin and goes nowhere
2,A very dissapointing Movie........,"When I first saw the preview and the review that Darkness Falls is scarier than ""The Ring"",I knew this had to be a great movie, I was wrong. First of all, its so predictable because its that same recycled "" Im Not Crazy!"" story line . Second when ever some one gets killed its so fast and dark that at some scenes, you don't even know what your looking at. I must admit, the begining was scary and made me jump but from there the movie gets more boring and less scary. Most importantly this movie is definitly not scarier or better than "" The Ring"" because it dosent even come close to the suspense of that great movie . Lastly, the movie seems so short since every scene goes so fast. It just seems like a bunch of people came up with ideas and just thrown them together with not enough detail or terror.If you really wanna see a scary movie, don't rent this because this dosen't even belong in the horror category"
2,This Movie Isnt What I Expected,this movie really wasnt horror it was borror it was so boring and laughable at how the plot was i thought the begining was good but after that it seemed to only go down hill this movie is about an old lady who dies and gets even with the people that killed her so she playes as the evil tooth fairy killing children on the last night of their last tooth the plot had some intresting points but i must say through out all of it this is not a winner its a loser
5,Excellent,"Excellent, I always like this movie, i did have it in regular dvd but now I want it the blue-ray and I got it. I'm very happy about it."
4,Darkness Falls (Special Edition),"A GOOD LITTLE HORROR STORY IF YOU LIKE WITCHES AND HAUNTED LIGHTHOUSES, AND WHO DOESN'T? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FLICK FOR A DARK OCTOBER NIGHT."
1,Darkness Fails,"I once met Emma Caulfield at a Buffy/Angel convention and she was a walking stiff, no personality, barely smiled, ate a huge piece of chocolate cake without looking up once. She acts in this movie just as she did at the convention...lifeless and dull. The story could have been so good, but fell into that rigamorale that terrible horror movies sometimes step in. A story goes bad either because a)the cast sucks b) the effects suck c) the writing sucks or D) the bad guy is ridiculous. In this case it was all of the above. Everytime I saw the Tooth fairy i wanted to bust out singing phantom of the opera."
1,Stupidity falls on the eyes of the uninformed...,"I guess I must be in a supernatural mood today, since this is like my third review in a row of a film in this genre, but this is also going to be the shortest. The less said about this laughable disaster the better. When a film is so unintentionally funny that you realize the `Scary Movie' franchise wouldn't have to doctor scenes to get a laugh then you know that the film has failed in a LARGE way. Seriously, cut, paste and laugh your backside off; that is how ridiculous this film is. The final scene, when the `tooth fairy' is exposes in all her preposterous glory, I did a barrel laugh that shook the bed and then nearly peed myself it was so horrifically hysterical. I don't even want to attempt to explain this film's `stupid' plot. Just do yourself a favor and skip this trash altogether."
2,Beware of vengeful phantoms and lousy horror movies,"Slick production values cannot save a script that's vapid and that's insulting to the viewer.There seems to be a horror subgenre which could be called ""Promising Beginning But Rapid Descent Into Stupidity and Unoriginality"".Spare yourself 80 irksome minutes and skip this; it's a bland action flick with a supernatural villain. Even the big reveal of the demon's face behind the mask is hardly worth sitting through all that nonsense."
1,god-awful!,"This was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Any movie with an evil tooth-fairy as it's villain should never have been made. This movie was not scarey, the acting was crap, and the movie was just so stupid that I was laughing most of the time. Do not see this unless you find humor in corny movies, which I do on occasion."
3,Plastic Toilet Shim,"I use these shims, together with the level tool, as part of the business simulation game I have developed. As part of the game, this shim has nothing to do with a toilet anymore!"
5,"La Zorra, The best hip hop hardcore in Brazil","Soulfly: La zorra!!! Planet Hemp: This guys kick ***, like Calavera en los albunes de Sepultura.Brazilian's music the best"
4,Brazilian rap at its best,"Planet Hemp is one of the greatest rap bands here in Brazil, and this CD kicks a**, totally.. One of the best tracks I've ever listened is here, and it's called ""Hemp Family"". This song talks about a group of bands who wished that marijuana was legal in Brazil. ""Hemp Family"" is quick, makes you feel both great and angry. Another great track is called ""Queimando Tudo"" (which means ""Burnin' It All"") who talks about crime and marijuana. And the other track who deserves respect is called ""Zerovinteum"", who talks about Rio's dark side (crime, drugs...). Marcelo D2 and his band kick a**!This song has lots of drug contents, violence and cussing, just like the american raps. If you like rap, this CD is a must for your collection, even if you don't speak portuguese."
2,Do not send the product they offer ....,Do not send the product they offer ....Do not send the product they offer ....Do not send the product they offer ....Do not send the product they offer ....Do not send the product they offer ....Do not send the product they offer ....
5,"Mature, easy on the ears, and still KICKS!!!","Sin Pecado is quite a bit different from Wolfheart and Irreligious, due to the fact that it is something even the parentals won't be screaming about every ten seconds! The bass for it is very hypnotic, and through that, and Fernando's own voice, Moonspell has added another chapter into their already impressive musical diaries. If you like the deep throatiness of Type O, and the deep bass of most goth-metal bands, this album is definitely worth the listen!"
4,Moonspell,"Moonspell has had many wonderful albums in their career so far, and as ar as this one goes, it is one of the best. I was going to try and tell you what songs were the best, but I can't. They are all incredibly good."
2,2 stars for 2 good songs,"Except for HandMadeGod and 2econd Skin, this album is a huge disappointment. Thankfully Moonspell learned quickly and improved greatly with Butterfly Effect. I wish they'd return to their roots, like Wolfheart and Irreligious. Those were two of the finest albums ever."
2,"Charmless Imitation of the ""Soup"" Books","My mother got me this book as a gift...and it is a truly interesting idea for a book. This book lacks the charm of the ""soup"" books...most of the stories are drawn out from the one sentence in which they could be summarized. It seems as though Ford, in trying to solicit stories, accepted the first 101 and did not edit or improve any submissions at all. Some of the stories, granted, are interesting, engaging, and even a bit spooky. Unfortunately, the majority seem contrived and more the fare of late-night campfire chats or urban legends than genuinely inspiring stories of the ""other side"". In future editions of this book (which I am sure there will be), Ford could, should, and for her own integrity as a writer, must be more selective in choosing her stories. And.. just *perhaps* she could make the parody title a tiny, tiny bit less obvious."
2,The title is deceiving,"I bought this book with the intention of giving my teenage niece something spiritually inspiring and interesting to read. She has many questions about spirituality and eternal life, and she loves the sensation of goose bumps on her neck. I wanted to reconcile these interests into something healthy for her soul and psyche. At first this book appeared to fit the bill nicely, touting its stories of ""Angels, Miracles, and Healings,"" but the old cliché ""never judge a book by its cover"" holds true! Having read a few of the stories myself, I can only conclude that this is NOT the gift to give my impressionable and daring niece. While many are first or second hand accounts with angels and miracles, several others revolve around experiments in the occult (ouija boards, witchcraft rituals, etc.) that are not meant as cautionary tales. If this book is a gift for a teen in your life, you might want to think twice about buying it."
4,"Nice, but not for everyone","If you're thinking of switching to waffle-weave towels, I'd suggest buying one to start with. This is a well-made, handsome product, but it's definitely different from a terry towel. My wife says, ""It's fine. I'd prefer a regular towel."""
4,bath towel,"It is great, great cuality, durable. Easy to wash and dry. The only thing I did not like is, that the border wrinkles and waves. So it needs to be ironed."
3,A Good Reminder of Going to the Cheetah Concert,"This CD is recorded live at a Cheetah Girls concert--so it makes a nice collector's item for those who attended this last year. There's only one new song (""Falling for You""). They sing all the hits from the two movies.The sound quality isn't fantastic with some very hallow-sounding microphones. Plus the fact that Raven-Symone isn't singing with the group means that the sound in the live concert is a bit different from the movie soundtracks. But this album is successful at what it's meant to be--a recording of a live concert where people can relive the experience."
3,Same or not as good as other brands,"I usually bought small, powdered, vinyl gloves at a local health products supply store. They are now $9.00 a box, so the amazon price was better.These gloves fit well. They tear easily if I am in a hurry, or my hands are damp. Some brands my local store sold were made well, but I did not get good gloves for over a year at my store. The quality varied, as with these Dynarex gloves: some tearing or ripping problem with some gloves in a box.I am ordering different gloves, but they are still made by the Dynarex company."
4,Always Enjoyable,I find Lewis Black laugh out funny. He is such a good commentator on politics and daily life goings on.
1,Jimmy Pardo - I turned this off after about five minutes,"I've watched a lot of Improv (both taped and live), and I was willing to give this guy the benefit of the doubt. By the time he's done busting the crowd's chops, the ""comedy"" he started doing was really lousy. Bad delivery of average concept jokes...nothing impressive. I'm so glad I didn't waste 30 minutes of my life with Jimmy Pardo's Comedy Central special."
5,"Classic economic drama, poetry, and prose","Compiled, edited, and with an informative commentary by Michael Watts (Director of the Center for Economic Education and Professor of Economics at Purdue University), The Literary Book Of Economics is comprised of seventy-eight selections from classic drama, poetry, and prose written by thinking men and women through centuries of history, all chosen for the particular vibrancy of expression that they give to twenty crucial economic concepts and themes. The citations range from William Shakespeare and Benjamin Franklin, to Ayn Rand, Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut and much others, each of whom contribute to a deeper understanding of market principles through literature. The Literary Book Of Economics is a unique and highly recommended addition to Economic Studies reading lists and library reference collections."
4,A blend of literature and economics,"College-level collections strong on either literature or economics will welcome a blend of the two by an economist whose purpose is to blend economic education with literacy. Economics are best absorbed when blended with other disciplines, studies show: and Watts shows how to achieve this, using over seventy selections from classic and modern writings to link over twenty major economic concepts to themes and modern times. A unique, cross-disciplinary approach."
1,Trite,"Trite crap. Inspiring? Maybe if seeing a beggar makes you feel like your own life is OK. Reads like a contract fulfillment with a publishing company. Pointless details leading to existential flat-lining of a seemingly creative spirit. I've just espoused more meaningful ideas than this book. Eno, stick to sonics. Ambient reading is a dead avenue."
4,"Much like his music, it is pleasant and goes nowhere","Excellent, a book which applies Eno's principles of ambient music. The book goes nowhere, establishes texture and tone, has no drive, is holographic and can be read in any order, and offers consistently good and occasionally brilliant insights."
5,"Inspiring for Any Creator, of Anything","Caveat: I read this book back in 1997. I am just looking at buying it again, and re-reading it!So, that means I don't remember the specifics that well! What it ALSO means, though, is that it was SUCH A GOOD BOOK for me, that I still remember it, and want to read it again!!Regardless of what you think of Eno's work, this book is JUST so inspiring becuase he is a relentless creator, curious at all times, and always trying new things! Just constantly experimenting, and continually belives in himself, what he wants, and what he's working on. And this makes him a charasmatic figure, and his work interesting simply on those merits.This book is really inspiring for all creators of anything."
4,Eno's Swollen Appendices,"Eno's diary is as compassionate, opinionated, and clear as I expected, but the reader is still left to wonder about this guy. I know it's not an autobiograpy, but Mr. Eno just doesn't tell us enough about himself. Nothing is heartwrenching, he never gets depressed, he's never extremely sad or extremely happy; he's quite robotic on paper, in fact. As odd as it sounds, nothing is peculiar about his remarkable day-to-day life, and I find this more than a little suspicious. Luckily, his unique observations, extreme opinions, and exposed fetishes (including his well-know affinity for extremely large women), generally keep the reader's interest.The appendices that follow the diary are quite detailed expositions on his thinking process, views about art, and include several letters to his well known clientele. Somewhat oblique, but interesting nonetheless."
3,Interesting when it isn't Dull and Slightly Pathetic,"Eno is a great musician and thinker. He is also a middle-aged, middle class British man. One is far more interesting than the other. Too bad they both showed up for this ""diary"" that in its later sections loses steam and credibility as spontaneous ruminations of a day."
4,Great saw on sale,"Runs very quiet. Compared to the old Sears contractor saw, this is a 1000% improvement. Wing extensions are about a 1/32"" low from surface of table. Not a huge problem but it did require grinding the mounting holes to get a level surface. Shorted some parts but Delta quickly supplied. Only hang up I have is with Delta and their instructions. These are the worst instructions, particularly the fence installation, that it has ever been my misfortune to use. The instructions are particularly confusing because they try to cover an installation on a uni-saw, a contractor saw, hybrid, or another manufacturers saw. The pictures are not accurate, instructions are not sequential, and I ended up discarding them. Complete set up took about 4 hrs and should have taken 1 hour at most."
5,Great full featured speakerphone.,"Full duplex speakerphone sound has to be experienced to be believed. Headset lets you dig through files with both hands or keyboard without hindrance. Caller ID and call-waiting caller ID gives you a full time paid for receptionist. Call logs and auto dial from call logs makes it easy to get back, even to people who don't leave voicemail messages (or forget to leave their phone numbers). Second microphone on back of unit for conference calling is also impressive.... mine worked fantastically right out of the box and has continued to do so for the past 18 months. Great company with great design - check their website for occasional product rebat offers. I got [some money] off on my phone."
2,Flawed product from a first rate company,"I found the Soundstation product I use in the office to be so good that I decided to get this product for my home office.I purchased the 2 line version of this phone. I had two problems immediately. The light on the mute button stopped working. Also, there was this annoying intermitant hum on the line (which all others on the call could hear as well). I called their customer service and they were very helpful. They apologized for the problem. They told me that the hum was a design flaw and that new models shouldn't experience the problem. I asked them to send me a new version of the phone so that I wouldn't have this problem going forward. They gave me a return materials number.I received a replacement phone in the mail within a week and found that phone to have the same problem with a hum. I am very disappointed that they don't stand behind their product. If there is a design flaw then they should replace the product or refund the purchase price."
3,I was disappointed to find information 20 years old.,"I purchased the book with excitment only to find out that Dr. Atkin's had published an updated version in 1992. The covers, titles and dates are confusing. As I understand from my research, the newest copyright date is around 92-97 and the title is ""Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution"". While reading the old version I purchased from Amazon (which said it was reissued in 1989)I found it was the 1972 copyright book titled on the cover ""Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution"". Be aware if you are looking for the newer version to start your diet off with the latest book. Santa, please bring me the newest book."
5,the best ever,This book is better than any that have come after and the recipes are the best. I was so pleased to find it still available.
4,Dr. Atkin's Diet Revolution,"It's a great start on a lifetime diet. However, it is dated (recipes call for products that are not available today) and I have now bought ""The New Atkins for a New You"". And I've lost 12 pounds already!"
3,Losing weight but sick of eggs,After 3weeks on this diet I have lost 11 pounds. But I am getting tried of eggs and meat. What do you do? I am not hungry at all but I am getting sick of the food we are suppose to eat. I am glad I am losing weight but in the long run is it bad for my body? This diet is good for a while but I am afraid it like all the others. You get tried of eating the same stuff all the time. I must said my son has lost 5 pounds and feels good. But like I said before is it good for your body in the longer run?
3,"Two, the magic number.","I wasn't aware until I received this book, but I already had one. At least I now have no excuse for not getting it correct."
5,The Dr Atkins Diet is Unbelievable,"My friend told me about the diet, she had lost 28lb in 2 months - so the 1st day I started the diet without reading the book, the 2nd day I bought the book and found it very informative, especially about carbs and insulin. (The book doesn't really go into detail about exercise). Now I understand more about the way our bodies work with the different types of foods we eat. Everything he wrote was true, by the end of the first week I had lost 8lb and without no side-effects. Three weeks later, I have lost a total of 21lbs - I have been trying to lose weight for the last 4 years and for the first time in my adulthood I am able wear a bikini. I always keep the carb counter with me at all times and love the Vanilla carb drink. This book is worth more than its weight in gold. I have passed the diet on to my friends who say I look fantastic. Thanks Dr Atkins."
4,very informative interesting view of medical information,"The information was very easy to understand. Every thing was explained in detail. Great ideas on adapting this diet to yor lifestyle. Good supply of receipes, easy to folow directions. I am a little skeptial of trying the diet because of the lack of fruit and Vitiman C. I am not a big believer in vitiman pills. Natural food is better, why not eat fruit? I can see if you cut out all man made foods breads, cereal, pasta ect and sweets why you would loose weight. Actually the food piramid that the government issues for humans is quite similar to the food groups used to fatten hogs for market. Think about it."
3,"Unhealthy plan, please be careful.","I was able to lose 10 lbs. in 3 weeks, however, I had pain in my kidneys and feel this diet is really quite unhealthy. Our bodies need a full array of vitamins and minerals to work efficiently. Dr. Atkins would like you to take supplements along with your diet. This says to me that he knows there are critical nutrients missing in this plan. A quick fix but a bad eating for life plan."
2,"might work for some, but not a good general diet","I tried this diet for awhile. I was skeptical as I think atkins resorted to hyperbole when discussing the negative efffects of carbs, it didn't seem to match my life. I did the dit for just over a week, and:1) Didn't lose any weight 2) Didn't have any energy, so I couldn't work out 3) Had dizzy spells.This might work for some, but you first must determine if you have a carbohydrate problem. The book seems to sugest that every person who is at least a little overweight does. This is not true. I also question some of his ""studies"" and ""facts"" as well as the long-term health risks of eating this way.david"
2,Atkins Diet Revolution,"I ordered the original ""Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution"" book, but I received the ""Dr. Atkins"" New Diet Revolution"" cassette. There wasn't a return address on the envelope, so I was unable to return the item."
3,My Husband Lost Weight - I gained,"For some reason this diet seems to work much better for men than women. My husband quickly lost 20 lbs. (but I am not convinced that a diet that high in protein and low in fruits and vegetables etc. is good for you for any length of time. I gained weight and many other women I know claimed the same result. I would have to say that for some of us, this diet just doesn't work. Counting my calories and eating from all food groups has worked much better for me."
5,Great Buy!!!,"Brake disc arrived promptly (3 days) and was in brand new condition in the original box, unopened. These brake discs have always performed well and I will continue to use them."
2,Engelbert is good...DVD quality is not,"It's a shame such an excellent ballad singer as Engelbert was only capable of having such a low quality DVD produced. For starters, the picture quality is the worst of my entire DVD collection. The lame 2-channel sound is not much better. There is constant feedback through his microphone while he is singing, which is often annoying, during the show. Although he sings decent on most songs, he is far too often goofing off with the audience, in a manner not becoming of a superstar. Perhaps his other DVD release is a better production and provides a better representation of what Humperdinck show is actually like. This one is not a winner."
3,nursery rhyme,Nice board book version of the familiar rhyme. I bought it for the interesting way the pictures were made.
5,Absolutely delightful,The illustrations are amazing. The scenery and characters look like they are made from cloth. My children wanted to read this book over and over and over :). The last page was especially fun with the lamb hiding under the little girls school desk.
5,Feeding Time On Monkey Island Must Live On!,"Much, much better than the Backstreet Boys. This cd must be heard! It should be required listening in all universities! It rocks! It rolls! The Saw is family, fer cry sakes!!"
3,Very Disappointing...,"While growing up, I watched the movie at least eight times and still remember most of the scenes and dialogs. I was very excited when I found a copy of Zorro (with Alain Delon) on the Amazon and bought it right away. To much of my disappointment, the movie was cut mercilessly, and as one of the reviewers correctly noticed, to a person who had never seen it before, it would be very difficult to follow the plot. It's confusing. But it's confusing ONLY BECAUSE someone took the liberty to `EDIT' it."
2,ZORRO RO ZERO,"You must be a Die hard fan of Zorro to watch this movie. it is like watching a Sword & Sandal movie in the sixties. the lighting is bad, the dialog is Bad, the sound is Bad, plus they keep playing this Awful Song Zorro is Back by some Dude named Onions. I don't see the Big Deal about Alain Delon playing Zorro. I'm a Great Fan of Zorro. I have all the movies made of Zorro. I got this to add to my Collection. If U are not a Die Hard Fan of Zorro, Leave this one out. U will be alot more Happy. and your Wife, Family & Friends will not look at You and say When are You Going to Grow Up."
3,Not the complete movie - too much cut out,"Even though this movie was panned by critics we Love it! It is a fun movie for Zorro fans. However the original movie that we have was recorded from T.V. and is on a VHS tape so we were hoping to upgrade to a DVD. This is the second DVD we have seen of this movie and while this is the better one it is still NOT the complete movie. Much of the beginning was cut out, scenes in the middle as well as much of the all important dueling scenes near the end. The DVD itself is of good quality as far and picture and sound, it is just that the movie is not all there.Very disappointing.Jeanette"
5,fun!,"This is a very enjoyable zorro movie, although somewhat removed from its original roots, it makes it all the more better. I like how colonel Huerta suspects the Governor/Zorro from the begining and every attemp he tries to catch him he fails. Alain Delon is the perfect Zorro and Stanley Baker a good villian ""only real danger and actual bleeding can teach a man to fight.""The only problem is trying to find a good copy of this movie. I have had 3 different copies, all from different companys, and each either leave out a scene or two or have betters or worse picture quality. I ordered the DVD in hopes of the better."
1,Missing pieces,"This DVD is simply a digital copy of the VHS tape that was released, which is missing several scenes, most notably the opening scenes where Diego rides into town and bumps into his old friend, Miguel, at the inn. It's about 15 minutes without which the story makes little sense, at first. Don't pay more than $8 for this, and only if you're an avid Zorro collector."
2,"Zorro, with Alain Delon more of a spaghetti western,","The film seems more of a spaghetti western then what you'ld expect from the Zorro seen on television and the 1940's & 1950's. Alain Delon, even with his chisilled looks as the protaganist, seems more like he should be the Commedante, then Zorro. He acts like a patsy in his alter-ego, rather than a man that was an intellectual, and someone that was in control of his emotions. This Zorro, did't act like he could control himself when things got close boiling point. The fencng scenes were put together rather well though. END"
3,Still not right,"This vhs version is probably the most complete version available. That's what's so sad. The TRUE complete version is NOT available and runs about two hours. There are several scenes that have small pieces missing. One scene in particular is completely gone. That's the part after where a diguised Governor sneeks out through a secret passage and sees what's happening to the people first hand. It is then and only then that he learns about the legend of the Black Fox when he sees a young boy marking a fence with a "" Z"". He didn't arrive with Zorro already in mind. It's a critical piece of the story that I have not seen since 1975 and have yet to see in any version since.This version jumps from him finding the secret passage right to his first appearance as Zorro. The package claims it is 124 minutes. It's not.It's more like 87 minutes."
4,Foxy Masked Avenger,"I enjoyed the movie, even though the VHS film clarity was questionable...more like a copy made from of a copy of a copy. This older version is action packed. Alain Delon's portrayal of Zorro is outstanding. I particularly enjoyed the scene where Zorro brings the vilain general down to his knees and forces him to apologize to the fair lady. I understand that the original 2 hours version was ""butchered"" down to only 1 1/2 hour, ... still the plot could be followed, if one doesn't ask too many questions about the unexplained caracters that pop in & out...but please a note to the film editors...get rid of the backgroung music and song. It is the most obnoxious theme ever....la-la-la-no-respect, la-la-la-Zorro-is-back. God please spare me the pain of ever having to listen to this awful song again! I rated this movie 4+ Stars and the music ""Minus"" -4 Stars. Buy it, I promise you, you'll enjoy it. And when the theme song is played, simply mute the volume and rest your ears."
1,Don't waste the Money,"DVD is simply a digital copy of the VHS tape that was released, which is missing several scenes. Not really worth the money unless you just want it. movie is not the 120 min. version, which really fills out the story line. For the money keep checking the Wal-mart bargain bends and purchase it for 5.00"
4,Zorro but missing some footage,"I love this Zoro with Alan Delon. But was disappointed that scenes were cut out of it. What happen to the scene at the beginning where the little black boy explains the legend of Zorro. The scene at the bar or pub before the death of the real governor. His cousin which becomes Zorro goes to the town in disguise first, this all is missing. It should be 2 hours long --- Please provide the whole length of the film."
2,Alain Delon's ZORRO needs a visual and aural upgrade!,"This item, a spirited film version of Zorro starring gorgeous French actor/icon Alain Delon, was apparently produced by the French in the 70's, but the copy sold on Amazon is of very inferior quality. The transfer to DVD seemed to have been made from a poor theater print, with lines and color dropout all through the video. The film itself is fun, and Delon makes one forget Tyrone Power, since he is so much the better (and better-looking!) actor. Additionally, Amazon neglected to mention that it is dubbed, passably, into English. Very jarring effect! Shame that Lionsgate or one of the other foreign film distributors hasn't gotten hold of this and issued a more respectable looking copy, with its original French soundtrack and subtitles. Let's hope for this!"
3,Nice Film,"Transfer not the best but a delightful version nonetheless. Light and entertaining. If you want to have some fun, good to watch."
1,"""ZORRO"" great theme lousy transfer","Alain Delon is a favorite actor, whom I was once going to work for in Paris. I had never seen his version of ZORRO but the reviews seemed fairly good. So, I bought it at a reasonable price. But, it looks like a transfer from a 16mm print. Scratches, patches and faded colors. I had to throw it away. I don't hold it against the seller. They only sell product, and don't produce it."
5,Satisfied,"I purchased this as a gift, they were very happy with the product. All aspects of the purchase were handled professionally!!!!"
4,this edited version is as good as the latest full version.,"this movie is so good and large scale that it takes two or three viewings until you realize that it has been edited. Delon plays the title character as world weary warrior, who's passion is rekindled by the assasination of a close friend. The action never devolves into the cartoonish, but stays focused on the Zorro's ultimate purpose. The unveiling of power hungry and evil men."
5,"Zorro - if your into these types of movie, you will love it","When the governor of Nuevo Aragonia is burtally murdered, the little town falls prey to corruption. It is the responsibility of one man, Zorro (alain Delon), to clean up the town, and bring the criminals to justice. This swash-bucking epic shows us the many sides of the famous Zorro, from the charismatic Don Juan to the fearless swordsman, and is a feel-good classic family adventure to be enjoyed by all."
4,For the Samba collector! Great sound for an older recording that has captured time in a bottle!,This is hard to come by but worth seeking if your are a die-hard Carnaval-lover. If your not a the biggest Carnaval fan it may not be up to par (intensity wise) with the Samba schools current recordings of today and might sound like just any other Samba school recording. I liked it because I was able to see how far these schools have come by gong back to older recordings and because I cant get enough of Carnaval!
5,Sambas de Enredo 2001,"In the lead up the Rio Carnival, all the major Samba Schools participating in the main parade release their samba-enredo (samba theme song) on cd and radio. The object is for people to become familiar with of the songs' lyrics and so on. These songs, like those on this cd, are professionally recorded in a studio.I bought this cd simply to get a hold of the opening track by the Imperatriz school, a song about sugar. However, all the tracks are fast, fun, joyous and a wonderful example of the bright music which accompanies the Rio Carnival.This disc comes with the lyrics too.As a lover and player of samba music, I recommend the 2001 cd to all. However, if you're not familiar with samba music, it's advisable that you shop around a bit more. Though samba-enredos are the prime of samba music, they're quite unlike Bossa Nova or other slower samba tunes. Samba-enredos are heavily percussive."
2,A Poor Anthology. There IS Better Out There,"This anthology failed to impress me. Most of the stories were truly poor not worth the time to read. There are a couple of exceptions. Most notably where Denise M. Bruchman's ""Lesser of Two Evils"" and Edo van Belkom's ""The Rug""; I would readily give these two stories five stars each. The two worst, most dissapointing works in the collection were Richard Christian Matheson's ""Help Me"" (a true waste of space), and--brace yourselves-- Stephen King's ""Autopsy Room Four""; both of these works were pathetic sensationalism--I've not read any other R.C. Matheson (though I'm a fan of his father's), but I KNOW King can do much better.Don't waste your time or money. Check it out from the libary to read the contributions of Bruchman and Belkom; bother with nothing else."
4,Pay attention to size!,I should have paid attention to the size of this toy. I sent it to my daughter for her first round of finals as she is pretty far from home. The dog looks like ours at home so it was a nice gift. I was pretty surprised at how small it was compared to how expensive it was. Next time I will pay more attention.
2,A very cute overpriced little white fluffed up bean bag.,"I agree with what some of the other reviewers stated. It's cute, but very small. I didn't notice, but it is part of the Beanie Babies collection. Seems to be overpriced for what it is. $25 bucks for a little white fluffed up bean bag. Very quick shipping, but it was crammed inside a plain cheap first class envelope. I'm not impressed at all with this transaction."
4,The City that Never Sleeps,A well shot amateur flim. Captivating with its surreal and spellbinding imagery. A defiant and uncompromising vision.
3,Too many recipes call for heavy-duty mixer,"The book I received did not look like the photo, so I'm assuming it's the same with a ""new"" cover. I understand this is a reprint of an earlier favorite book. This version however, requires a heavy-duty mixer for many of the recipes. I do not have one and was looking forward to ""hand-made"" bread. I am not sure how to translate mixing and kneading times from mixer-time to handwork-time. The extra copy I bought for a gift I am no longer sure will be as appreciated for the same reason. A bit disappointing."
4,Good but needed better editing,"Having seen the suffering and failures of conventional treatments, I was very interested in this DVD. Mr. Anderson has an axe to grind given family history and at times his biased views takes away from the facts & info presented. He could have shortened the DVD or included different content if he did not spend so much time repeating the same point(s) over and over.On the other hand, the info and references presented offer an enlightening picture of how the American approach to food and medicine have created a truly dysfunctional health environment.There are choices in how to prevent cancer and treat it...........the DVD clearly presents them.As a result, I've picked up a book from one of the guests on he DVD in my own pursuit to improve my diet and cancer fighting strategies."
2,Healing Cancer from the inside out,"I purchased this for my parents, because my father was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphoma. He had already gone through 4 rounds of chemo when my mom watched this. It is very anti-chemo. If someone has not tried chemo yet, this may be helpful, but for those of us who have chosen the chemo route, it was very scarey and borderline insulting in regards to the choices we have made. I"
2,Curing Cancer From the Inside Out,"""Curing Cancer From the Inside Out"" - DVD takes the approach that western medicine's reliance upon medication, invasive/toxic cancer treatments and surgery are totally wrong-headed. The various presenters take to task the pharmaceutical industry, doctors who use radiation and chemotherapy to deal with cancer and invasive surgery. Instead they move to the other side of the spectrum promoting adoption of very specific plant-based raw food diets to avoid and combat cancers and other chronic diseases. My wife, with a BS in nursing was put off by the extreme views. As a vegan for over 20 years, I can appreciate the concept but the message was delieved too heavy-handed."
5,VALUABLE INFORMATION ON TREATING CANCER,"This video is the most comprehensive presentation of an alternate treatment for cancer I've ever seen. The information is very valuable for everyone, but especially for someone who has been diagnosed with cancer, before he / she chooses to undergo chemotherapy or radiation treatment."
5,A DVD Everyone Should Watch,"This truly is one DVD everyone should watch. Instead of believing all the lies we are fed on a daily basis,seek out the truth. It only makes sense that you can't poison the body to heal it!!! If you have cancer or know of anyone who does, you would appreciate what this DVD teaches. Life is about choices. Choose this DVD."
5,Great movie!,I really enjoyed watching this movie! I hope to impliment some of these ideas in my daily life. Great information!
2,"the book it self, awesome..","This book is awesome.. however, the one that was sent to me marked ""good"" condition is so old that its yellow-orange, the binding is half way off, there are bends and rips all over it. The middle section is half way out.. This book should should have been sold for 5 cents.. I am very disapointed in the condition of this book."
4,Just what I wanted,"I was looking for an easy care tablecloth and this fits the bill perfectly. the color (ivory) is perfect, and it's just dressy enough without being too fancy. i recommend it"
5,"Elegant look, yet stain resistant","This tablecloth is a nice combination of elegant looking cloth with stain resistance you're more likely to see with plastic. I liked this so much that I bought another one. Now, when one gets dirty it's tossed in the laundry and the other one comes out to take its place.These are holding up nicely after numerous cycles in the washer and dryer. They're not losing their stain resistance, and that's a big plus.We usually only have adults in the house, but my 2- and 4-year-old grandsons were here recently and they gave the tablecloths a good workout! I'm happy to say the cloths held up just fine.If you're looking for a pretty tablecloth that looks elegant, but also one that can hold up to daily use--including spills--this is a great choice."
4,i like!,am happy with it. wish i could get it in vinyl also. i am pleased that i found one that was oval
5,great tablecloth,"I needed to hide a (sturdy but) table with many many blemishes, and wanted a durable tablecloth. I registered for this - didn't buy it. I got the white one, and I wasn't sure it would be heavy enough to cover everything (I think someone left a wet cereal box or something on here - I can read the whole thing). It covered everything so our guests will never know, AND the stain resistant properties are as reported. It even resisted honey! It beaded up just like any other liquid. I'm washing my placemats today... and just shaking out my tablecloth :)As for it's casual-ness or formal-ness... I think it can go both ways. Just depends on what else you use to dress your table. I use it as both."
5,Alien technology.,"I'm not entirely certain how they did it, but a full glass of juice spilled on this tablecloth didn't sink in. It beaded up and waited for towels to sop it up. If anyone is old enough to remember playing with mercury blobs in science class, that's exactly how the spilled liquid acted.I highly recommend this. (And it's a really pretty shade of blue, too.)"
5,liquids just roll off of it,this is the best table clothe I ever bought - liquids just oll off of it - no stains to sink in and ruin it
3,No answers,The stories and the exercises in this book appear fairly simple and I think achievable by a newish student of French but there is no answer key. As someone who is doing a self giuided study programme I find this a little frustrating as I cannot correct myself. I will probably use this book but I think I will wait till my French is more advanced. I would recommend this book to someone who wants to supplement classroom learning and can ask a teacher for assistance.
1,New York's Alright if You Like Saxophones,I honestly did not care for this video. I don't know whether its a post-feminist statement or high class porn but either way it doesn't work. I would have been more interested if the women went into more details about their life rather than staged banter or the video footage was not so stylized as to be almost anti-erotic. Now if Richard Kern had directed it that might be another matter.
4,Goth Girls making good...,"This is pretty fabulous. It's a documentary about a troupe of Goth Girls moving out of the shadow of society's norms and making their own rules and following their own paths through life. These are young women in touch with their own bodies and souls, and using their sexuality to carve a niche for themselves. Pretty inspiring, actually. This DVD is for adults only, but don't expect the usual adult fare..."
1,Do people here realize what a scam this whole thing is?,"Suicide Girls was started by a guy named Sean, and a lot of punk and goth girls saw it as ""empowering"" but it's just porn. Missy is the visible face but this is not a feminist enterprise. Wake up. Google them and read some of the stories of how they've screwed over models, faked diaries, self-censored themselves and taken pictures down, then lied and said they were targeted by the FBI. Sean has become a multimillionaire pornographer but there's nothing ""alternative"" here. I've seen the whole thing from the start."
2,Boring,"I saw this DVD and I thought it was boring. I also noticed that there were no black or hispanic suicide girls. There was one black girl and she wasn't featured. All it is is thin girls who have tatoos and piercings, no full figured women."
4,Minus all the flesh it's still fun.,"What initially tempted me to buy this was that after becoming a member and then being able videocast suicide girls to my ipod I needed a closer look. The dvd is great and what I thought would be an hour show was actually more like a two hour documentry on the show, the girls, the concept and generally why they do what they do. Makes you wish you were there."
5,Suicide Girls - The First Tour,The DVD arrived in a timely matter and the DVD was a gift for a friend who enjoyed watching it.
1,What is this?,How incredibly disappointing. Not what I expected at all. It was boring and incredibly immature. I thought these women would have some amount of sophistication or intelligent/interesting things to say. I compare this to listening in on a locker room or a sleep over. More than half the time me and my friends were questioning why half the stuff was put on this disc. Just wasn't worth it.
1,Do not buy it,"A very uninspiring DVD on what should have been a story about a very exciting group of individuals. No message, no vision, nothing to remember."
5,Outstanding,The story was put together very well and so was the directing. These beautiful women don't only look interesting but they live extemly interesting lives. You can tell that they love how they live and they are compfortable with who they are.
5,Incredibly packed with information,"After watching this tape a few times, I decided not to enroll in a college nutrition class. I can't imagine any class being as informative and entertaining as this tape is. If I needed to take a course in nutrition, this tape would certainly be a valuable asset to review for tests."
1,SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE!!!,They try to cover too much and don't go into each important topic as they should. They talk way TOO fast and I was VERY disappointed with it. NOT WORTH BUYING!!!
1,Zizzi Bossa Nova is your THING!,"Singing in Italian language or Napolitan Dialect is not your thing woman. Singing in those two languages you sound more like Amalia Rodrigures (the Portuguese Diva) singing her old melodic FADOS. The difference is that Amalia does good work singing FADO and she does it with her soul, because Portuguese is her language and FADO was her life. Come on Zizzi, Italian or Napolitan are not your first languages and Portuguese is. So do what you do the best: Singing Bossa Nova and do it in your first language that is PORTUGUESE. I love you in Portuguese but I detest your voice and accent in Italian or Napolitan. Like said before you sound more like Amalia Rodrigues singing old FADOS when you sing in Italian. I wish I could give ZERO STAR to this CD."
4,Great image... but just one little detail,"I've purchased the portable DVD/ DivX player for my kids and it hasn't disappointed us!The only problem that I've found is that if the subtitles for the DivX movie come in a separate file, they are not played at the same time.This is not a problem if the movie is in your language or if the subtitles are incorporated to the movie file."
4,Bought this for my 3 year old grand daughter,"This has the clearest picture I have seen on anything in a long time. My grand daughter watches Cinderella III and Swan Lake Barbie on it and they really come to life. The only complaint I have is that when the dvd loads it makes an noise but it doesnt have any other problems and that is probably just part of the whole loading process. It is pretty easy to operate and we keep it in the box it came in while she watches it (just leave the screen open and slide it back into the box, I made a little slit for the cord) that way she cant play with the buttons or put her feet on it. :-) All in all, so far so good and it was a good price."
4,"I love it, but...","I agree with the other reviewers (well, with the exception of the guy who's machine died) and just want to add one thing.I wanted a portable player that plays divx and this one looked the best. It does have problems with some of my divx files (I don't know why just some files). These files work fine on my Philips dvp3040 player or in the divx software player on my computer but some of them have problems in Windows Media Player (with the right codex) as well. Very odd.It does work with most of my AVI/MPG/MPEG/DIVX files, so I'm still very happy for the most part."
3,Just ok.,"I'm a big fan of Pern, but I have to say that this is one of my least favourites. I just couldn't get into it."
2,This book was really not that good.,"I'm going to keep this short because this book doesn't warrent that much of my time. Nothing really happens in this book. I've read the prior Pern novels and they were good enough to enjoy for a light read. This book, yes, pertains to the history of Pern but does not add much to it. Nothing is really accomplished, except that this is a start of a different era of history. I kept waiting for something to happen that is notable but nothing really did. You get a few small tidbits of imformation about the origional colonists but not much. This book really makes me reconsider weither or not I will read anymore Pern books."
4,"Interesting, and different from other Pern books","Some descriptions of situations are a bit too long, but it gives a different wiew of this strange and interesting society. Here the hero is a weyrwoman who has a not so good relationship with the mate thas has been imposed on her by the queen dragon. It has the same problem of other Pern books. Lot of people with strange names come and go, and you have to go back and look ""where did I see this personage before?"" (For that the Kindle is perfect)."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Moreta is supposed to be some sort of mythological figure in Pern history, of some sort. She is the rider of a queen dragon, and while at a festival she discovers the outbreak of a disease, along with some others.Some of her fellows take the ostrich approach to the situation, and her queen is pregnant, so to try and get the cure to areas ahead of the disease wave she has to borrow someone else's lizard."
5,intriguing,"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful, well written, and perfectly characterized. All of her series are great but the ones that take place on Pern are the best of all."
5,"Moreta, Dragonlady of Pern","I have probably read over a thousand books in my life and I have neverhad a reaction to a happening in a book as I had to this one. When Irealized what had happened I found my self sobbing as hard as I did whenI put my Great Dane down over 15 years ago. This book was one of herfirst Pern books I believe as it was published in 1983. It was so wellwritten as far as emotions for the people and non-emotional/logicalthoughts of the dragons. I also have never written to an author but Idid try to send an e-mail to A. McCraffrey after I finished as I justfelt I had to tell her of my experience with this book. I hope she rec'dit. If you want to start reading the Pern books this is a great one, ofcourse they are all very good. Her creations are the best, she thinksof everything and why. Have a great ride!!Maggie CollinsThousand Oaks, CA."
4,Beautiful Book,"Beautiful poetry from a wonderful person whose life comes through radiantly in her poetry. I can not read her poems without thinking of her connection to her husband Donald Hall - their poems cross back and forth , even after her death. She uses her/their life but stays far from the ""confessional"" mode. This book, like the title poem, brings me great peace."
5,I must have!,This is a wonderful cd. I searched everywhere for it...was thrilled when I found it on amazon! The vocals are amazing!!!
5,m o r e a l b u m s l i k e t h i s n e e d t o b e m a d e ..... v e r y i n s p i r i n g,m o r e a l b u m s l i k e t h i s n e e d t o b e m a d e ..... v e r y i n s p i r i n g
4,Not a novel,This is reading of an Essay written by Fuentes which tells the story of Fuentes' parents from about the time that he was conceived. It is not a fiction novel.
4,Love it,"The T-Buddy is absolutely wonderful - I saw a coworker with one and had to have it! I love that I can carry my freshly brewed tea wherever I go. One downfall might be that you're stuck with the tea bag or leaves in there the whole time, so it just keeps brewing which can lead to a very strong flavor or too much bitterness in some teas, but overall, I'm really happy with it."
4,The album that introduced me to dark metal.,"I love the Identity series, and I have to admit that this one is the least consistent I've heard. Still it's got at least 7 great songs and a few other good ones. That's a great deal for less than five dollars. Even if you don't know anything about Black metal, and the other musical styles represented on this disk, it's worth a little cash to hear something that could change your life as it did mine. This album made me discover Theatre of Tragedy, Moonspell, Lacuna Coil and other brilliant bands. I reccomend Identity 5 to start out, but this is also a fine compilation."
4,La noche vigilada,"Recomiendo altamente este libro que no solo es ameno y esta bien escrito, sino que constituye un verdadero testimonio de la desgarrada situacion cubana y sus alienantes circunstancias"
2,Badly structured,"Very frustrating organization. It is supposed to be a workbook format but does not stucture lessons for easy learning. Has too much coming at you too quickly....you have to jump back and forth through sections to piece together the information you need to successfully complete the exercises.Generating frustration (rather than starting small and buidling on early successes) is not a good way to go....especially for a book that is trying to appeal to those ""idiots"" amoung us that expect a simplified format. Not happy with this book at all."
4,Well worth a listen,"Bob Dylan's son-in-law and one of the most underrated singer-songwriters around. Himmelman writes the most intelligent and uniquely original love songs as illustrated in the song 7 Circles on this CD(another example is ""Love of Midnight"" on the From Strength to Strength CD). There are several radio friendly songs on here, but it is definately not ear candy. He can be tender and he can flat out rock. ""Eyeball"" and ""Million Miles Wide are perfect examples. You will definately not be dissapointed in this selection. The above mentioned ...Strength... CD is Peter Himmelman at his best."
4,When well this guy finally make it big!?!?!?,"Short and sweet, Peter Himmelman is the greatest musician never to make it ""bigtime"". Bottom line is, this guy is a true artist and should be seen where ever and whenever he performs. Hey Pete, the 'Himmelheads' love you!! ""LoveThinketh No Evil"" only reiterates these points."
4,One of the better road trip albums to have,"I own TONS of electronica tunes and compilations. I must say this is one of the best all around chill albums. If you find you liked this one, I suggest checking out the K&D; Sessions by Kruder and Dormeister to start.My only beef with this album (for the mp3 downloaders) is that track 3 ""Die Halbstarken"" does not exist. It is the coolest song on that album."
2,Shaolin flop,"This movie wasn't as good as its label appeared. It was a poorly written movie, with unconvincing characters. The storyline was quite disappointing."
5,Basic PED-Basic,"It is a very basic software - all you can do is to change the size of images from 90% to 120%,preview and download them on your design card.If you have windows 7 do not use the CD software that comes with it. It's too primitive for it. [...]The software works great and is simple and basic. You'll be very happy with it unless your expectations exceed the software's capabilities."
4,works well just should've been more clear about windows vista,I ordered this card last week and received it over the weekend. I went to install it and was having problems. It wasn't until I went to the brother website that I learned you are NOT supposed to put the included disc in your computer if you have vista. NO WHERE in the advertising or package did it say this. I understand that vista is quite new but Amazon should make sure those who purchase this need to go to the website to upload the upgraded file for vista.
1,Beware Windows XP x64 Users!,"I really can't rate the product itself because I can't use it! I have Windows XP Professional 64-bit Operating System and no matter what I try I cannot get the drivers to work with my OS. Have tried Brother support and they just keep telling me to do the same thing over and over to no avail. I am not computer illerate but have had absolutely no luck with this product with this OS. Beware, if you have XP 64-bit OS!! I will have to get my computer guy over here to try to install the drivers, if he can't get the drivers installed, I guess I'm out the money for the product, even though Brother says it will work with my system. What a hassle!!"
1,Sucks!! I tried and tried to get it to work. :(,"This program SUCKS!! DO NOT BUY it! I bought PED-BASIC for my Brother 150 embroidery machine so I could transfer files from the internet to my machine. My computer is a Dell with Windows 7 on it. We just bought this computer brand spankin new ONLY about a year ago. I open the PED-BASIC, can't click on the icon to view or upload any files. The program opens fine in my computer. That's about it. I installed the programs that every website recommends, still DOESN'T WORK. I'm going to try to return it. Major disappointment."
2,thought it would be easier to use.,"i'm a geek, but this thing doesn't do what i thought. i can't seem to put designs on a card. it's ez to install the software, but not the panacea I'd hoped for, at this price. I'm also miffed that a multi function card reader wouldn't have worked. Ah well."
4,BASICS,"GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE CONSIDERING A 4MB CARD ALONE COSTS MORE,LETS YOU SEE YOUR DESIGNS & BASIC EDITING,STORE YOUR DOWNLOADS IN YOUR PC & TRANSFER TO RW CARD AS NEEDED EASY FAST COOL NEED MORE CARDS BUY PED BASICS GET CARD & READER AS BACKUP BETTER THAN 149 FOR CARD ALONE ONLY READS PES FORMAT"
2,install?,It is still sitting next to my computer because I can't get it installed. Very frustrating. I am unhappy that I can't download new designs.
5,Brother PED,I am new to embroidery but this little progam is great for a beginner and advance. I just wish the blank memory cards were cheaper.
3,Not what I thought it would be,This is not what I thought it would be. But for those who are interested it would not be the right place to start go directly to Brother ask lots of questions... get help understanding which one is the one you will be able to use.
2,Not What I Needed,"There was nothing wrong with this item, but it was not what I need. I returned it and have purchased a more extensive PE-Design program, so that I can do more than just download designs."
2,"He tenido problemas con el Harware, nunca lo pude usar desde que lo compre// I had problems with the hardware. I never used sinc","Hola, desde que compre esta pieza para usarla en la maquina de bordar, nunca la he podido utilizar para copiar imagenes, solo he usado una unidad USB que ha funcionado bien.Hello, since I bought this piece for use in the embroidery machine, I've never been able to use to copy pictures, only I used a USB drive that has worked well."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this product from Brother. The PED-Basic does not allow you to do anything except view embroidery designs on your computer put them on the reader card and take the card to your embroidery machine. I can do that directly from my laptop. Spent $100 on a worthless accessory. What's even worse is the card that comes with it is not usable in the much more expensive palette program reader I wound up buying so I could edit patterns.
1,Could not figure out how to use it with my new brothers machine..,"I didn't realize that I only had 30 days to return these products...With Christmas, my friend that came to show me how to use it just came to my house yesterday and she told me I ordered the wrong program...I needed the brothers pe design 7 for my machine...All you sell is the lite version.. and I wanted the other version...I do wish you would refund my whole purchase price for these products...I do order lots of stuff from y'all and really love all the things y'all have to offer us customers...Thanks for all the stuff y'all do have...I wish y'all would sell the Brothers PE Design Ver. 7....I will be mailing back these two products..I even ordered the other one for my friend that has a machine just like mine..And she couldn't use it either...I will pay for the return shipping..Will be waiting to see my refund credited to my card...Thanks"
5,WOnderfull product,"Have used this itemt many times and enjoy it very much. The price was very good, the item is also very well made"
4,"Was a little hard to install, but after installation I like it.","This software is hard to install correctly. Needs to have drivers updated on the CD so it will install on a newer operating system. Once installed it is working to save my embroidery designs, then easily use on my machine."
1,"Got the item, card won't read!!!!","I received this card reader and card and was able to easily transfer designs from computer onto the card, but when I plugged the card into the machine it says ""This card cannot be used on this machine"". Only had 30 days to find this out so now I guess I'm screwed."
4,Embroidery!,I bought this when I was doing embroidery. It is not too complicated to use. I just don't use it that often.
3,Too Expensive,It does what it has to do.But nothing more.I think it is too expensive for what you can do with it.
2,Brother Embroidery Card Writer,"I purchased this item from Ken's Sewing and Vacuum Store. Unfortunately, I had to ship it back to them because it stopped working. But, they have a 30-day policy where they agree to check out the item and/or replace it. I am waiting to hear back from them. Barbara in their customer service department was very friendly and helpful."
3,Can't get it to work with vista,"IS this a problem with software or microsoft? I don't know, but wish the amazon advert was clearer.... I now have sheets I can't embroider for christmas, a $120 piece of software that's not working....and a headache...off to the brother site to see if there is an updated driver....if not I'll be REALLY upset! IF you have VISTA or Windows 7 be sure to do your research before buying and make sure you can find a driver!!!!!Ok, i upped this a star, there is a driver on the brother website, so DONT use the disk, but go get one offline to use. IF you accidently do download the disk first, uninstall it, then reinstall from online. A bit of a pain, but otherwise, the software seems to work ok..."
3,"OK, but not great.","It's high in price for all you get. It works OK, but you only get a one MB card. So it won't store to many designs. For the price, my Wife should have got, the 5 MB card."
5,tres pratique,"Très bon achat,très utile lorsque l'on possède une brodeuse brotherFacile d'utilisation et d'installation.Je l'utilise avec le programme embird pour créer et modifier les images."
1,Defective,"I loaded the product on my machine but I could nt get to work, so I took it to the sewing machine shop and they tried it in one of there machines and it still would not work. So I am returning the product an unsatisfied customer."
1,Ped-Basic software,"The problem that I have is that it does not work with windows 7. I have tried every thing no luck, so it cost me $97.00 for nothing. Very sad."
1,Not good with Vista Windows for me,I ordered this for my Brother PE-770. My computer has Windows Vista which presents a challenge for the PED Basic. I followed the directions on the separate paper that was sent. I couldn't download PES files to the PED. Then I uninstalled everything and went to the Brother site and followed their solutions for installing on Windows Vista. I worked for 4 hours trying to get this installed and to download PES files but never could. I am somewhat tech challenged although I have used a computer extensively for 14 years. I finally gave up and returned it. Amazon was easy to do a return and refunded my money immediately. For me this was a disappointment. I am sure there are many other people who enjoy the PED but I can't recommend it.
1,Don't Buy!!,"Sorry I bought this item!! ""Don't waste your money!"" Totally recommend AMAZON & company I purchased from-just not PED-Basic!! I wanted to use different fonts other than on what's on my machine-took me 2 days to figure how to save, unzip, and view files in the PED. Uninstalled and downloaded drivers off of internet and everything! NOW can't use but one font at a time on machine-won't let me use whole name. Keeps deleting font I've adjusted. I've spent $30 on different fonts to get different sizes-kept getting error ""embroidery card can not be used with this machine"" I so wanted to learn how to embroidery using a beginner machine-didn't want to put a lot of money in an expensive machine if it was something I really didn't enjoy-wish I had gone and bought a more expensive embroidery machine (with usb port) because I've probably spent in total as much as one would have cost me."
1,Can't get it to work and Brother won't help,"All seems so simple, except it simply won't work. At first the issue was that it wouldn't save the designs on the card from my computer and it kept crashing. I had to reload the software several times from the Brother site. (And that tooks hours and hours because it continued to crash and reloading software means deleting it, restarting, downloading, uploading, restarting....) Finally it works from the computer end for the most part- crashes sometimes but not always. And now? No matter what I do, the sewing machine won't recognize the card. I've gone back to the brother site and followed all their directions. I've emailed Brother several times. Their solution? Follow directions on the website and don't bother us. Nothing we can do.What a total waste of money and worse- a total waste of a LOT of time. What I'm going through is not an isolated issue- I've seen tons of reviews and questions on the web asking what can be done to fix this issue."
2,Will not work with Windows 7,"This would not work with my computer. Windows 7. You are supposed to be able to download an update from Brother's website but that didn't work either. No help from Brother' website available. I can't see where this would be of any use to anyone really. Have purchased embroidery cards that work fine and other software but see no use for this item. Of course Amazon is great and I was able to return it for a refund, which is why I love Amazon. Best place to buy anything. Amazon 5 stars but this software not worth buying."
3,only fair,seller is great. item is limited to basic. needed a card writer for PE Design software and thought this would work but it does not.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"The most important thing to know about this card reader is that it is only compatible with ""Brother"" brand cards. Any other card with designs that is not made by Brother, even if it is the same type of card and IS COMPATIBLE with your sewing machine, will NOT WORK in this reader. Amazing BOX cards or any other 3rd party embroidery card of the exact same format WILL NOT WORK. This means.... unless you buy the more expensive ""brother cards"", You cannot use any purchased embroidery designs written on cards. You must download them from the internet and write it to the card that comes with the reader. If you are buying this to replace any other embroidery card reader system, such as Amazing Box, none of your cards will be readable!!!"
3,Brother Software for se400,"The package comes with a 4 meg card, reader, and software for downloading patterns. Lets start with the card and reader, 4 megs is a small amount and the reader is on the larger side. The software is for down loading only patterns that you buy or get. Putting this all together is the cost that comes out to be $95 to $100. The cost for current stuff is too high and should no more than $30. There are more cards with more memory, readers that are smaller and with more capabilities, while the software is for ONLY down loading patterns is limited. To end this, it is too little for too much money and should be better priced.On the good note the item did arrive very quickly and as described."
2,"Works, at a price!","I gave this product a low rating more for its value than its performance.The product does what it is supposed to do, it allows you to transfer designs to your machine and in that respect you just can't do without it (Brother got you by you know what...).The software that comes with it is at best 'primitive' and offers no editing capabilities what so ever. The user interface would be considered state of the art around 1990!It only organizes your designs, and then very poorly.Transferring designs to the card is also primitive. You can not add designs to the card cumulatively for it erases the card every time prior to writing to it!Al in all, at its current price, a serious ripoff. Unfortunately it is all you got if you want to load new designs into your machine.I feel that at $100++ it is way overpriced, the package's true value should be somewhere between $25 and $50."
3,Product works. Proprietary product is customer rip-off,"Product works as advertised. I am able to transfer embroidery patterns from computer to the card and put it on the machine to sew.I consider this proprietary stuff from Brother is a very expensive solution for the work it does. After all it is just a 4MB memory card and a card writer. Millions of devices in the world use open standard like a USB drive, SD cards or CF cards which cost only pennies per MB, and you don't need any special card writers. You have no choice after you bought the embroidery machine if you want to make use of your machine!"
5,Great product,This is a great product. Basic. Easy to use. Helps you take your embroidery designs from the computer to your sewing machine. I was having trouble finding the software to do that with my used Babylock Esante ESE2 and when I found this I knew it would be just what I needed. I had an older model of Esante and had used the older Pallette system. This was tons easier. Works better with extra software though. I use the Buzz embroidery software to move designs around and convert formats. This product will only move them for you. It does not convert.
5,Excellent Card Guard,"This card protector is a good weight, about 1.5 to 2 times as large as a poker chip, and feels very well made. I get a lot of compliments on it when I'm at the table. Its metal is exposed along the edges, but the enamel interior is protected by some sort of plastic with a rubber feeling to it that will keep your cards well secured below the weight when it's on top of them.Once again, it looks good, it's well made, and it's definitely worth the money."
2,oops,Thought this was Pink Floyd's best. Wrong! I listened anyway and returned. This is an accomplished guitarist who need more innovative material.
2,"good for ""very beginning"" level or a book shelf collection","The book does have tons of color pictures, but the contents are only good for elementary level. It shows you how to install performance spark plug wire! That is how elementary it is. For turbo or supercharge, it has only a few pages of color pictures, not very informative. There is nothing in the book you cannot find from the Internet. Good for book shelf collection. defenitely not a book for any garage warrior. I regret the purchase."
2,it shows you how to insall the pedals...,"does anyone not know how to screw the pedal set onto your car? this book will show you how to turn the screw drive illustrated with color pictures!!! I bought both this book and the Haynes compact sport performance, and regret the both purchases. I was looking for something with more creative ideas in customizing one's car, and this book is nowhere near my expectation. This book, imho, in nothing but a chronicle of installating parts (such as the pedals). There is only one valuable section showing you how to custom build your own speaker box, but still far from considered informative. I was thinking of purchasing Haynes entertaining manual, but after reviewing these 2 books, I am having different thoughts."
3,Worse than beginner level,"If you know anything about cars, you know more than this book. this is for people who have never looked under the hood of a car. its that basic. Like other reviews said, it does have tons of cool pictures, but if you need something more advanced, ask a tuner shop, and make sure they have good knowledge. They will help you out more than this book can. If you think you need this book, get it. But its not even worth the three bucks its being sold for."
4,Easy to Read and Follow!,"I am a beginner to all aspects of automotive care and customization. I found this book extremely easy to read and follow through the steps to achieving the end results shown in the examples. The photos helped me ensure I was on the right path because I could see what there was to work with, and provided an easier way of checking to see that I was on the right track. With several months of working my way around my car, I can see how I will eventually outgrow these books, however if you are someone who is just starting out and enjoys do it yourself customization I recommend this series."
5,Looking Back at the Highlife.,"I bought this album in 1986 and became an instant Winwood fan. I think High Life is his best work because of the 8 tracks there are no losers. This is a tight album intrumentally and lyrically and vocally. Steve came out of nowhere with this in '86 and never again reached the success he had with High Life. Sure, Roll With It was a good cd too, but it lacked what High Life's authenticity. Steve sounds personal on High Life whereas Roll With It sounds more manufactured. Refugees of the Heart and Junction Seven are okay but have even more musical flaws. High Life is definitely the cd to own from Steve. Arc of a Diver would be my next recommendation. The box set The Finer Things is also quite good. Buy Back in the Highlife and you won't be disappointed, it's worth the money."
4,Replacing analog copy,"Bought this to replace an analog copy (tape) that I no longer use, because well... who listens to tapes? I have 4-6 mp3 players as small or smaller than a tape cassette and they sound better. I will definitely enjoy having a better quality version of this album."
5,Stevie,I was looking for a greatest hits album but this one has several great songs that don't appear on his compilations so I just had to buy it. You can't go wrong with a performer of his stature.
5,Great album,"CD was well produced, and had great tracks.If you like Steve Winwood, this is a great album to buy."
4,"Excellent, if not a little dated","The album tracks are equally as good as the radio overplayed singles. My favourites are ""Freedom Overspill"" and ""Finer things"". The release of this album in 1986 cemented what a great year for albums that year was. Not only did we get ""Graceland (Paul Simon)"" but this album which put Winwood right at the top of the charts. Listening to it again the other day, makes me very happy but I do think it is a little dated in sound. Has 80s written all over it, ie. the saxophones. Steve also had a love of synthesizers which unfortunately have not dated so well. The success of this album saw the record company quickly release a compilation of sorts called ""Chronicles"" but it was not quite a greatest hits. It was aimed to present a snapshot of his earlier stuff and remixes of ""Valerie"" and ""Talking back to the Night"".""Back in the High Life"" is worthy of your collection - it does need a digital remastering though. OVERDUE!"
1,The Minority Report,"I realize I'm alone here, but Steve Winwood's voice reminds me of a cat trapped in a burlap bag with a mouse stuck in its throat. This may have been a good album for the mid-80's, but it was this kind of drek that gave rise to the ""alternative"" scene a few years later. There's one song I like here, ""The Finer Things,"" but listen to it interpreted by someone who understands it, like Linda Thompson or Delores Keane, and you may see what I mean. If not, by all means enjoy!"
3,"Have a listen, but...","After 3 albums where he played virtually all of the instruments, ""Back In The High Life"" expands to a full band. Whatever revitalizing effect this may have on Winwood's music is mitigated by Russ Titleman's glossy production, which goes down easy but doesn't hold up to repeated listening.The songs are memorable, and unlike on most of Winwood's albums, there is no obvious filler. ""Higher Love"" still manages to be rousing after 20+ years. But ""The Finer Things"" and ""Wake Me Up On Judgement Day"" suffer from trite choruses, and ""Split Decision,"" despite Joe Walsh's input, shows none of his trademark humor."
4,"This album got him ""Back In The High Life Again"".","There's only 8 tracks on this album, but half of it is some of his biggest hits ever. Included is ""The Finer Things"", ""Freedom Overspill"", ""Back In The High Life Again"", and the huge song ""Higher Love"". Plus the other tracks are good too. Overall a good listen, but what he needs to do, is release a best of his solo years, including the hits here, the hits from ""Roll With It"", and then some. Then he could call that collection ""The Finer Things"". I'd buy it."
5,Excellent pop songcraft,"Just a few weeks ago, I listened to Higher Love again as I have many times, and thought about this album from 1986. This is one of the best pop songs to come out of that decade, and 20 years later it still holds up! This album is such excellent pop songcraft, a strong emphasis on melody, song structure and dramatic landscapes. And I recognized Chaka Khan's voice singing in the song! Along with Higher, I still love The Finer Things (though cutting 2 minutes of it for the single sounded a little tacky--they took the best parts out of it for the radio single). The title track is wonderful. Freedom Overspill sounds a little bit like Higher, though with a slower groove. I love the horns as well as Steve's keyboard playing throughout the song. It can be industrial at times in the sound, and even hip enough to compete with young artists like Janet Jackson's hit album Control that same year. One other favorite is Wake Me Up on Judgment Day. It is still a dynamic album to this day!"
3,Pretty good movie except for the acting by the extras,"This movie was decent, but I have to give it 3 stars because of the horrible acting by some of the extras, one in particular named Gaydos. He ruins every scene he is in. From what I understand, he walked around the set all day in a banana hammock, except his twig and berries were so small the other male actors kept mistaking them for those little grapes. And he giggled and liked it."
3,A true period piece,"Very ephemeral, with some nice tunes and memorable lyrics. Appeals to children of all ages. Borders on being a succession of stories, but well told. Very short for the format (36 mins). I found ""Miles From Nowhere"" and ""Wild World"" Moving when I was a student and, after playing the disc more than 25 years later, still did. Give it a try, it's worth it."
5,Cat Stevens Best!,I was introduced to this album back in the late 80's and had been hanging on a old cassette till now. How nice to have it on Cd now. Every song is still just as good as the first time I listened to it.
4,STANDS THE TEST OF TIME,"I loved Cat Stevens when I was a teenager in the 1970's, and hearing his music again today, it really stands the test of time. What more can be said? Oh yeah---the artwork is cool as well."
5,Essential music for this baby boomer,"I consider Tea for the Tillerman ""desert island"" music, as in survival music.I have to admit that I tend to hear ""Mona Bone Jakon"" through ""Catch Bull At Four"" as a continuum in my mind and heart, but this is not to diminish ""Tea,"" which was my opened window into Cat Stevens's 70s journey. To this day, any one of these songs can stop me in my tracks. ""Father and Son,"" ""Hard Headed Woman"" and ""On the Road to Find Out"" are tragic, spiritual, joyous all at once. You will see.Regardless of what followed for Cat, this is music that shaped my soul and will always be a part of who I am. I still have the vinyl of all those albums! I cherish them like heirlooms to pass down to my family as part of my heritage. Maudlin? Not if you were there in the 70s, in love or in touch. Even if you weren't, you'll find much sensitivity, insight and genius here. Wholly recommended with all my heart."
4,The second coming,"After returning from illness Cat Stevens produced 3 magnificent albums, with this, his second, being the defining moment in his career. At his peak with songs like ""Hard Headed Woman"", ""Where Do The Children Play?"" and ""Father and Son"", Cat Stevens's star burned brightly for two years on the strength of this album and ""Teaser and the Firecat"".Even now those two discs represent music which has seldom been approached for its poetic lyricism and melody. The gentle instrumentation, perfectly recorded and mixed by ex-Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith, adds to the ethereal atmosphere."
4,Don't Leave Tillerman Out,"If you're rebuilding your Album collection, don't leave Tea for the Tillerman out just because you have Cat Steven's greatest hits. Here are some gems that don't get bundled with anything else.Tea for the Tillerman was Cat Stevens at a point where he was most creative."
5,Tea For Cat,"This is such a great album.Mona Bone Jakon, Tea For The Tillerman, and Teaser and the Firecat are all perfect LP's, just get them all. You can't go wrong with Cat Stevens!Where Do the Children Play is my favorite Cat songWild World is probably his most listenable songMiles From Nowhere, Longer Boats, and On The Road to Findout are some of his best as wellI think this is one of the coolest albums to be a fan of, everyone should give it a chance"
2,Good not great,"SACD is stereo only. I have very high end playback system and audio is indistinguisable from CD to me. Save your money and buy the CD or high quality digital download, no advantage for the SACD.I do love the music - one of my favorite albums - I am refering to the SACD recording only."
5,man that brings back memories,"I havent listened to this in probably 35 years,I cant remember what happened to my vinyl,guess we will never know,who cares,the CD is better.Cat is like the Eagles,Doobies and Bee Gees,timeless.Do yourself a favor,buy it!!"
5,A Classic!,"This is a must for any collector. Cat Stevens is an excellent songwriter, a poet creating a window into a very special time when communication through music was clear and to the point! I'm sure that if he ventured into releasing a new collection today, it would be embraced and appreciated, now more than ever. The songs are sweet, unpretentious and honest......enjoy!"
5,A defining moment in many lifes,"This album will bring back many memories of a much simpler time. Most that will remember this album were probably in their teens or early twentys when they first heard it. The song Wild World which is still heard from time to time on many radio stations can still bring back thoughts of young love and how much we miss those times. Without going into each song, I can say that listening to this album again, takes you right back to a place and a time you wish you really could return to."
5,The best!,"An avid Cat Stevens fan, I always find his music uplifting. The CD recording of Tea for the Tillerman was way better than the old LP that I had. Yep, just dated myself."
1,Sound quanlity is abominable,"This is the worst CD recording I have ever listen too. They must have had absolutely no clue how to mix. Do NOT buy this CD, purchase the Gold instead.P.S. This album is awesome, and I give it 5 stars, its just this particular re-recording that is crappy."
5,Cat Stevens-Tea for the Tillerman,Very talented artist whose early work was pretty amazing. A must have CD.
3,Tea for the Tillerman,"Though Cat Stevens is a remarkable song writer, the selection of material for the bonus CD was not good. The singing was off his best performances, and was audibly dissapointing. Save your money. If you need to get the original Tea for the Tillerman as a backfill for your collection, just buy the original. You will not be dissapointed, and you will save money."
5,"After all these years, still one of the greats",I bought this when it first came out and then haunted the record stores for any subsequent albums issued by Cat Stevens. When he converted to Islam I was broken-hearted only because he gave up song writing. I wore out several records and was very happy to have all of his works come out on a CD and now as Digital releases.
2,RFID ruins album art,The music is Cat Stevens. It's as always great.The RFID tag that is stuck to the album art will ruin it when removed.Bad Move whomever had the idea of putting RFID tags on album artwork.
2,Tea,"Just wasn't impressed by this album. I don't know where to begin, just no songs I liked, but I can't put my finger on why I didn't like them"
3,Peace train . . . yeah right,"I used to love this album, but ever since the Cat converted to Islam and calling for the death of people with opinions that differed from him I've been unable to listen to it or any other CS album. What an incredible shame. He used to fill my heart with joy. Now my heart runs cold and fills with the hollowness of evil.But if you live under a rock or can otherwise remain unaffected by the man's religion or politics, this album is beautiful."
5,A Masterpiece,"I can't add much to the other reviews, except to agree that, yes, this is Mr. Steven's definitive masterwork. This has definitely stood the test of time. As a philosophy major, I can't agree with his narrow religious fanaticism, but his early works show an open-minded seeker with a gift for inspired lyrics and great music. I would also recommend Teaser and the Firecat, along with some great works of literature such as Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, and Why I Am Not A Muslim."
2,NOT THE GREATEST BOX SET!,"I'm not a big Doris Day fan, but I thought I give the set a shot. Thought Love Me or Leave Me was excellent, Calamity Jane was very good and even Lullaby of Broadway and Young Man with a Horn weren't bad, but the rest were sickenly sweet. I thought Jumbo and The Pajama Game would NEVER end. Even Jimmy Durante couldn't save Jumbo! And The Glass Bottom Boat wasn't even worthy of the Three Stooges. The good news was I was able to sell 5 of the movies on Amazon, kept three and even made a profit by selling them individually so the box set didn't cost me anything and I made a few bucks on Doris too!"
5,Doris Day Collection 1,"If you like Doris Day, as my mom does, this is a great set to own. They are very funny and entertaining."
1,too bad they don't track,Great movies purchased as a gift for my dad...too bad they don't track.We went through two sets and found the second set no better than the first.
4,Doris Day collection,"This set showcases Doris Day's versatility. She has proven her ability in drama, as well as musical comedy. Day shows new levels of emotional depth. We can relate to her vulnerability, as well as her strengths. She has always given 110%in every performance. She is to be commended for her courage in facing her personal difficulties head-on. She remains a beloved and respected personality."
4,Dangerous Music,"Hooker is one of the most unique and unabashedly dangerous players/composers existing within the free jazz idiom. The only thing I can think of that somewhat compares to this is Sonny Sharrocks Last Exit forrays. This cd recorded in 95' is just as relevant and challanging today as it was 5 years ago, high energy avant garde that slaps you in the face and kicks you in the stomach. No one is making music like this. Free jazz that packs a punk rock punch! Enter if you dare."
5,Hot Story,"I really like this book at first I thought I was not, but I did great. There was a lot of great scence.. hahaha. I came through to really like the charcters and the storyline.. I guess because I am a former wallflower myself... Smile, Smile.."
3,pretty,"it is beautiful, but got dirty very fast! I'm still trying to clean it with the right stuff, but it's worth it, b/c it's gorgeous and a wonderful size. And too adorable."
4,"Women, Islam and Gender Relations","This book is a collection of various article and essays on Islam, Muslim women and gender isssue. Discusses how Muslim women negotiate their public space within the Islamic framework with various strategies. The veil or Hijab is a symbolic piece of clothing that not only perpetuates women's resistence but also the ability to redefine gender roles order to claim their rightful place in society that had been denied them."
2,"Save your money for Paul McFedries ""Idiots Guide to HTML""","This book absolutely bites! DON'T BUY IT! It doesn't deliver what it promises, and the author presumes too much prior knowledge."
1,barely decent,"""Recover your Soul"" is dull. This single is not like ""Something about the way you look tonight"" by a longshot. The other two songs ( I know why I'm in love"" and ""Big man in a little Suit"") are just as dull, with no meaning. If you want to waste 3.99--buy it. In other words, don't get it."
5,Just wanted you to know:,I love this fragrance. I found it four years ago by accident and I have been using it ever since.I received it in a very timely manner.I sing it's praised to all who don't know.
3,Expected a better read,"The book was originally published (or at least written) in 1944, by a friend/colleague of Tesla, who inserts himself into the storyline a bit too often. The author obviously idolized Tesla, and even in pointing out his flaws does so in a way that largley minimizes them. The story of Tesla's life, achievements, and oddities is truly remarkable, but I had hoped for a much better written account. The writing style seemed rather awkward to me, especially early in the book, and I found it to be distracting. The author engages in a good deal of speculation and moralizing, presents a very partial and stereotyped picture of Tesla.It's certainly not all bad, and the personal insight of the author is at times appreciated. But, to sum it up, it is (and feels like) a book written by a science editor, not a biographer."
4,Pretty fascinating stuff,"Once I got by the romantic flair of the first pages, I really enjoyed O'Neill's biography of Tesla. The subject of Tesla's life is certainly fascinating. He was a true visionary and a man well before his time.Minus one star for the romance (Is this typical of biographies of the era? I don't know.), for some circular logic (punishing Marconi for not seeing the potential of wireless transmission but lauding Tesla generating the first X-rays even though he did not grasp their potential).Over all, an informative and enjoyable read.P.S. I recommend Googling up Tesla's patents while progressing through the book."
4,The Original AC/DC,"Chapter 1 reads like the author is presenting Tesla with a lifetime achievement award. After that it's down to business. This is probably because the author actually knew Tesla. He relates some interesting stories, but he also speculates and reaches personal conclusions on aspects of Tesla's life instead of just relating the facts to the reader. That's the reason for the 4 stars.The book explains events Tesla saw growing up which piqued his interest, leading to some of his projects later in life. The book concentrates on his inventions, taking them from his incredible visualizations to finality, for the ones that made it that far. The descriptions of their electrical functionality are probably going to be hard to follow for someone without a science background.The author also shows how Tesla was a ""big picture"" guy and a poor business manager, resulting in his lack of funds throughout the later years of his life... but what a life it was."
1,Horribly written,The writing quality of this book is abysmal. It reads like a middle schooler's class paper. Not worth the money.
2,Hardly prodigal,Tesla was not prodigal by any definition of the term. He was a genius-fool with severe neurological problems. Omitting the real Tesla makes any biography of less worth than it could be.
3,Fascinating but take with salt,"The account and the subject are fascinating, but the work is of very questionable veracity. Legend, mystery and unsubstantiated claims form the basis of the factual content of the book. If half of what it claims for Tesla is true, he deserves a better biographer - for example one who knows what a footnote is...."
3,"Tesla and O'Neill, sitting in a tree.","This book reads like a verbal masturbation of Dr. Tesla's career. I am a huge fan of Nikola Tesla's research, but O'Neill really takes it far beyond ""doting fanboyism"". The first half of the book (especially the War of the Currents chapters) was a terrific read, the latter half became quite a chore as the author started getting into the more technical details of Tesla's projects. What was most frustrating, is the almost apologetic nature of the author's tone towards Tesla's shortcomings. This combined with O'Neill's tendency to defer to ""TESLA DID IT WITH ALL THE HAND-WAVY MAGIC THINGS FIRST"" as an explanation for modern technology really caused the book to suffer."
5,The Best Biography of Tesla Written,"Because this was a contemporary account, there is more of the real person and his real inventions than in later, more lurid accounts."
2,Salty Dog,Let me start by saying the first ingredient on the label is salt. We have tried both the ham and chicken flavor of LB Jamison's soup base and both rendered a very sodium laden broth. What's worse is that with the ham flavor you are generally adding it to other sodium laden ingredients so the soup comes out very salty. We ended up throwing the remaining product in the trash. I gave it two stars because I guess it kind of tastes like chicken if you can get past the salt.
5,Most BEAUTIFUL bag EVER....a *MUST HAVE* for Mommy :),"If there is such thing for love at first sight for a diaper bag,then I have fallen hard....I just saw this bag at BRU and couldn't believe how gorgeous this was.I have a 21 month old but we're trying for #2 and I knew I had to have this for when my hands are really full.I left the store & read about it on the website.It seems there is sometimes a wait for this, so I went back right away & bought one!Besides being such a fabulous design and color, it is SO roomy and will hold much more than a regular diaper bag.I have one I bought when I had my little girl and it harly fits enough and it's pretty big too. But this one is ROOMY and has a place for EVERYTHING and then some.There won't be a need to carry a purse either when you have this.This is a little more than most diaper bags, but this a spurge I would not pass up.This even gives my high end bags a run for there money, move over gucci & louis... there's a new bag in town!! :)"
2,Not worth the $$ ??,"I gave this bag for a baby shower gift (mother had registered for it). I have children also. I looked through the bag to find out what all the fuss was about. I'm still wondering..... My diaper bag that was a third of the price has all the same pockets, snaps, etc. Is being brown and trendy looking worth the extra $$ ??"
5,great diaper bag,"I went through several bags before getting this one, and it is the best by far. It has pockets that are labeled so you can tell what's missing at a glance. It's also made of very soft material, has plenty of room, and is stylish enough to not just look like a diaper bag. It's a little heavy, and the interior is the same dark brown so sometimes it's hard to see down in there, but overall I think it's great and would highly recommend."
2,"Could have been the BEST diaper bag, BUT...","it's just too heavy! I registered for this diaper bag after falling in love with the look, feel, many compartments and much more! Unfortunately once I started using it, I realized how heavy it is. At first I thought it would be ok and I'd try to fill it lightly - still no luck. I went to Target and spent about a 1/2 hour carrying it around & I seriously got a sore shoulder from doing so. If this bag had a shoulder strap it might help distribute the weight a little more. All I can say is this could have been the best bag I've ever owned (I have 3 little ones and tried many bags already!) but the weight ruined it all. I hope this helps you decide before you spend $69.99! Wish I would have known :) Maybe these diaper bags should have their weights listed like strollers do?"
4,So far so good,This is a beautiful bag that holds everything! I do agree with a few points that others have made: 1. it needs a shoulder strap (I'd like to hang it on my stroller) 2. it needs 'feet' for the bottom so you can set it down without it getting dirty and 3. it is a little bulky. This bag is the best I have seen in brown and very pretty. Oh and if you can't find it---ask at the store. They had a whole box on top of a shelf even though the space was empty.
5,"awsome bag, very stylish","I fell in love with this bag when I saw it in my local babies r us store and they were sold out. A few weeks later I was in another store and they had one left. I bought it and I'm glad I did. I can get about six to eight diapers,a travel container of wipes an extra set of clothes,a few burp cloths, a recieving blanket or two, my wallet, cell phone, and my keys and I'm set(I don't have to carry a purse anymore which I love). The only draw back about the bag is that the straps don't fit over the handle of my stroller. It fits perfectly in the basket."
1,I loved this bag - but had to return it,"This is a really pretty bag and it is large enough to hold everything for both mommy and baby... I ordered it after reading the reviews posted. I wish I would have listened to those who had reservations about the bag. My one and only reason for returning it is because once filled, this bag gets very heavy. To lug this around (does not have a shoulder strap to throw over stroller bar) all day long with a toddler, is just too much. I returned this and bought the Pink Camouflage Messenger Bag by Wendy Bellissimo instead... Its just as beautiful and has a ton of room for everyone's stuff, but it also has a shoulder strap so that you can hang it on your stroller when you are out and about."
1,Impossible to print,"I have ordered (and received) the paper/label set to print pictures in small format.I have also ordered the paper tray that goes with it otherwise it is not possible to print. Unfortunately, the paper tray seems unavailable - I've now been waiting several weeks, and have the feeling that soon, I will be told it doesn't exist. So, I'm stuck with the expensive paper and ink and won't be able to use them."
4,What is religion?,"I really liked the first half of this book. In fact I was saying to myself, ""Boy, this is a GREAT book!"" The second half I found boring.I bought this out-of-print book because I had read the obit of Ernest Gordon and thus introduced to a bit of what occurred in the prison of war camp. It seems like if you get within an inch of death and manage to survive, then you get true religion. This phenomenon interests me and for some reason I like to read about a person's real experiences. I guess it lessens my fear of death. When Peter Sellers died and was revived, I recall that he said he would never fear death again. But when someone tries to extrapolate these experiences into some sort of philosophy it always -in my mind- seems to fall flat. The purpose of life is to get on with it, no matter how purposeless it seems, but near death experiences seem to help me deal with the getting on with it."
5,"Roy, ""You've Got It"" still","Some pop icons fade away and are gone forever. Others stage comebacks, but end up embarrassing themselves. Then, there's Roy Orbison.Mystery Girl is as good as anything Orbison recorded in his 60s heyday, actually better than most. The songs capture that special early 60s flavor, but have just the right amount of modernization to keep the album from sounding dated. After all these years, his voice was still strong and clear when this was recorded in 1989, and the songwriting was excellent. Of course, having producer/musicians like Jeff Lynn and George Harrison on the project certainly didn't hurt any.If you are a Roy Orbison fan, if you still love ""Oh Pretty Woman"", if you think ""Running Scared"" was the best rock & roll love anthem of the decade, buy this album."
5,ELVIS WHO??,What a voice and underappreciated talent. I am 56 years old and followed Roy Orbison in his career from day one and was delighted when his career had a rebirth with the Traveling Wilburys and then his final release Mystery Girl. You will not be disappointed with this music.
5,A Fitting End to a Legendary Career,"Roy Orbison had a rather tragic life when it came to his personal life. Much of the pain he sang about through his career came from actual pain he had to endure. However, his last moments on earth produced what probably is his best work ever. Roy's talent had such an influence on so many artists and those artists let him know that, by producing these wonderful cuts. Although each song is great and the Big O at his best, ""Mystery Girl"" is truly the masterpiece. Thanks to this great album, a new generation was introduced to one of our greatest musical artists, that is something I am sure brought happiness to Roy."
5,"Stunning, MUST haver album!","Orbison fans will be hooked instantly. Those who aren't familiar with him (from another planet maybe) will take about 30 seconds to be hooked. Of all Roy's music, this album touches me most. Every song rings with his magical way of expressing his music.It makes you wonder what music could have been if he had lived longer!This album is a must have. Treat yourself to the beautiful sounds and movements of this album. You will thank yourself."
3,Koontz Fan,It was ok but just not the thriller that I expect from Koontz. Read where it was one of his earlier books previously written under a pseudonym.
4,Not Bad at All .......,"Koontz tries his hand at the spy and detective genres in this wild, twisting yarn about a detective who takes a job for a sleazy Senator and blunders into Things Better Left Alone. While its no *Manchurian Candidate,* its quite a bit better than average paperback paranoia stimulator; featuring a scary top-secret research foundation dealing in government corruption, mind control drugs other nasty things. It was the Soviets in the original version, but since he updated the plot for the 90s, he had to make it a former KGB project turned private project with lots of political and financial clout worldwide. I'd give the story itself 3 stars, but the excellent writing and realistic international settings push it well into the 4-star range."
3,Great ending but.......,"This is an interesting book becouse it shows Koontz going off in a different direction. As he states in the books Afterword, this is his only novel in the Acion/suspence/romance genre. Actually I thought it was trying to be in the same genre of most of James Patterson books. The probem I found with the book was that it developed too slowly. We have the same unanswered questions on page 360 as we had in the beginning. It's not until the book has as few as 50 pages left does it really get going. Descriptions of mundane activities is fine. It ads color and depth to the charactors but I thought it was excessive here. They got out of the cab, went to the museaum, checked into a hotel, made a phone call, blah blah blah. Thankfully the whole story gets turned around and it reallly has a stunning conclusion, but it was hard for me to get there. Interesting read, but I found books like Intensity, and Sole Survivor much more interesting."
4,Hitchcock In Japan,"This is standard Koontz fare, elevated by wonderful local color in Kyoto. It reads very much like a Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn intrigue/love story, the sort of thing Stanley Donen or Alfred Hitchcock would direct: the heroine is suffering from inexplicable amnesia, and the hero is a spy whose loyalties are in doubt. There's just enough suggestion of kinky weirdness to float it through - a bizarre character with metal hands, for instance. It's a bit long for what it is, but it satisfies."
4,What's not to like?,"An early effort (1979) by Dean Koontz, updated and more contemporary. It is in the suspense/thriller/cat and mouse category, rather than the more supernatural, atmospheric novels he is known for.It reads well, the pages fly by, the pace is always building and the flow logical. It is a book with strong momentum. You won't get bored.Strong characters, good action and a satisfying resolution.It gives one a glimpse at DK at an early stage, and is worth reading for that alone. More importantly, it works. I feel he does this genre quite well and wish he would give us a couple more like this and ""Dark Rivers of the Heart.""""The Watchers"" is still my favorite DK."
4,DIFFERENT...BUT STILL COOL BEANS!,"I didn't think I was going to like this book at first (which is exactly what I thought about my favorite book so that says something right there, hint hint: my fave book is 'Dark Rivers of the Heart;' if you haven't read it ya desperately need to) but this one was pretty cool! All the psychological stuff was neat but the dreams were kind of freaky! You can tell Koontz has considerably deep pockets (duh!) 'cause the way everyone always orders the quote/unquote 'proper' this and 'proper' that. But anyways, I LOVE this book and it was event the inspiration for one of the books I'm currently writing."
2,Audio version,"The audio version of this book read by a woman, I don't know who, is horrible. The woman has serious problems with inflection and I feel compelled to go to the library to finish the story. She is very irritating.The story itself, does not come up to the quality of DK's better books. It's OK but seems more amateurish than what DK is capable of. I guess it was one of his early books and he decided to dust it off and re-sell it instead of working on something new."
3,"His name is Koontz, James Bond Koontz","This book is unique for Koontz. The style is more like that of a screenplay, fast to read and filled with short paragraphs and dialog. The content is an international spy thriller, involving, and tying together, Vietnam heroes, Soviet spies, brainwashing science, the Manchurian Candidate, and scenes in Japan, London, and St. Moritz. This is not a horror novel, anymore than The Boys in Brazil. There is no supernatural element here. The story is good, and you will like it. But you will realize that Koontz is no Fleming, Le Carre, Clancy, etc. You can see why he went on to what he did. There is a good TV movie here, no blockbuster starring Harrison Ford."
3,Magnum Opus Vol. 3,"Didn't give this volume 5 stars because the full twelve inch versions are not included for every cut. The liner notes state the 6 minute plus version of Quincy Jones, ""Stuff Like That"" was suppose to be included. That didn't happen! The version that is included is only approximately 3 minutes long. Disappointing!"
4,From the knows-all-tells-all school of Fish-ology!,"I found this at a tag sale in Brooklyn. I had to buy it because of the subtitle ""His morals and manners"" and indeed the book knows all tells all from how the fish evolved to how it sees in and out of water to whether or not a fish can feel or remember pain.Anyone who liked Alan Davidson's (Encyclopedia of Food) writing will like this book. It's all hard facts and research, but Curtis has a sense of humor. I'm no ictyologist, but being that this book is about 40 years old I'm sure some of it is out of date. Still, there's plenty to learn as a layman without your eyes glazing over. In the section on how fish see, he suggests you lie down on the floor to look at the diagrams and if you still can't understand them, just skip that part!Good stuff!"
5,GLORIOUS MUSIC,"ONE OF MOODY'S BEST ALBUMS, EVERY TRACK IS GREAT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE AWESOME SHM AUDIO FORMAT. MUST HAVE FOR ANY CD COLLECTION, BUT DON'T PAY THESE RIDICULOUS OVER-INFLATED RIP OFF PRICES, I BOUGHT MINE FROM THE MUSIC SPECIALIST ON E BAY, SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF CASH.CHEERS!"
1,Chemical Taste Coffee,"I purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks. It has very little 'coffee' taste, and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate. Similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking.I will not be purchasing this coffee again. My suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else."
1,Alison,I am big coffee lover. This was some of the worst coffee I have ever had. It smells wonderful but the taste is horrible. I would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all.
5,A tremendous first novel tackling the question of identity.,"Powers' tackles how we look at ourselves, at others, and at history in this wonderful novel. Using the inception of photography, and one photograph in particular, as a reference point, he winds three separate tales that culminate not only in a varied cast of characters but in a fine understanding of how 'image' and the twentieth-century have become synonymous. A galley-full of historical references makes this not only a wonderful read but a lesson in the meantime. One of his finest"
3,Music A+...Arrangement A....Production B-....Mastering D-,"Produce-it-yourself albums have become more and more common since record labels have become more restrictive and technology becomes cheaper...This is a prime example of excellent talent, impressive performance history and a recording which falls short of the quality proven to be the standard from Dada.Dada is an incredible trio - Gurley's ability to rouse a crowd with his distinct Strat sound and style; Calio's Sting-like bass and vocal prowess, all backed by Leavitt driving the music forward on drums... None of that comes through on HTBF.What happened in the production, mix and mastering of this recording? Take it back for another try at the desk and let it shine for what it is...the 4th great album from Dada."
1,A fan's disappointment,"I've been a fan & have listened to their music since the early 90's. I got all copies of their studio releases but this is the worst to crash in to my collection. It seems the magic's gone...the vocal harmony & catchy guitar lines(how i wish i could play the axe that way!). For starters, I'd recommend ""Puzzle"" first because for me that's where my addiction to their music started.To the ""greatest roady trio"", you got yourself a filipino fan...but my heart just sank on this latest release you had but still...more power to you guys!!!"
5,just what I needed.,"My daughter came across this product, she had paid twice the price( at a beauty supply store) She had it for years and loved it . When I went on line and found it and ordered it, I was very happy I did ,It does the job better than any pumice stone and I believe will last longer. It is worth the money!"
3,Wish I could give a better review!,"I really like this Clover foot file, and this is the 2nd one I've bought as a gift. The one I bought for myself earlier this year is starting to have the black file part peel off. This is the same kind my professional pedicurist uses, so I'm not sure if I'm not doing something right, but I expected it to be longer lasting. I still continue to use it, I may try super gluing that part peeeling back on, because it files beautifully!"
4,Realistic Betrayal,"Richard A. Canterbury's ""Snapshots on Hell Street"" is just that, brief vivid poignant images of realistic human experiences. It will make you cry, laugh, shout outloud and leave you wanting more! A good read!"
4,A Painter of Words,"Richard Canterbury is a painter of words on paper. A gifted writer, he takes slices of everyday life, mixes in shades of emotion; and creates a collection of heart-warming short stories. Read ""Snapshots on Hell Street"" and discover a delightful picture of yesteryear.Maggie Oliver Anderson, Author, ""Murder by Prophecy"""
4,Definitely a talented writer,"Richard Canterbury is like a living camera, taking pictures with his mind and his words. After reading his book, I feel as if I've known these stories before, like well worn street legends shared among neighbors on the bus or in the laundry mat. Reading ""Snapshots"" is like looking through someone else's family photo album and seeing vaguely familiar scenes on every page; you get the feeling that you know of these people, you've seen this place before, you've heard of these events from someplace. Only now Richard gives us a peak behind the curtain and fills in some of the details, to our imaginary delight. I hope Richard decides to write an autobiography someday. I'm looking forward to seeing more of his snapshots of life. Anyone who enjoys short stories will like ""Snapshots."""
4,"After a couple others of their CDs, this - -","As noted before, almost orgasmic. They were known as The Girls From Bahia when I was playing them on a jazz radio station some 35 or so years ago; unable to speak/sing in English, they sang phoenetically written lyrics -- and they KNOCKED ME OUT as they continue to do today. The only differences are that they were kids back then with the tightest harmonics -- and now (so MANY years later) they're probably grandmothers. Still love 'em!!! They'll often start a song in unison, then, POW ---- they split = super-tight. It ain't ""jazz"" per se, BUT, much like OsCariocas, dynamite.When we return again to Rio, doubt if we'd go out of our way to catch them ""live"" if they were performing -- they seem more a studio group for records - - - but, truly, to my ears, they are magnificent!!"
3,It works ok.,"I tried this deodorant and I think it generally works to help with odor.But the thing is, after awhile for me, I smelled a collard greens kind a smell.It is clear and dries quickly but I was hoping to smell no smell at all and for much more hours.Other than that from my under arms, I smell nothing and that is a good thing.Just wanted to say that, there may be a slight smell of b.o. trying to come out but the deodorant tries to stop it from coming out or really getting out of hand to a very terrible smell!"
1,It does not work to stop odor,"Due to medical reasons, I am stopping the use of harsh ingredients in my products. This deodorant glides on well, smells nice - but it does not work. I am not the type that has to wear deodorant each day, and I do not have active b.o. .. until I started using this product. I smell off-putting. It does not work for me."
3,Brought back memories...,This is an older souvenir book. This genre tend to be poorly written but enjoyable. These photos are a bit oudated as much work has been done in Ephesus since its publication. This however is all the more reason to get it if you can find a copy. I wish that I had read it before my tour of this ancient city. Michael Barrett/Baltimore
3,"Better than the first. Still flawed, though.","...P>A quick synopsis...I liked this much better than the first...the characters weren't as dull or paper-thin. There was more going on in this movie. It was not just ""let's see how fast we can get to the next scene with guys in their underwear"". The plot is flawed by silly dialouge, and bad direction. Not really a horror movie...it still delivers on a small level...7 out of 10"
5,"Heard it, liked it, where can I get it!",I only like a small portion of techo/trance music and this CD is great. Unfortunately I can't buy it!
1,Should have read the other reviews before wasting my money,"First problem is that there is no seller contact information. Even Amazon doesn't know how to get a hold of this company, which is unfortunate because I would have loved to have someone explain to me why they thought that it was fair to rip people off.The case itself is much much smaller than it looks in the picture. It's about half the size of a standard piece of printer paper. It only comes with 12 dividers, which is nowhere near enough to do anything with, considering that there's 21 slots. The dividers are flimsy and don't stay down, so if you put beads next to each other they are bound to mix together causing massive amounts of frustration [happened twice while I was trying to set it up with 2mm beads.]If you need bead storage, I strongly suggest something is attached dividers.Bottom line, this item isn't worth the money and isn't very user friendly, and neither is the company."
5,DS Game Case,This storage box is perfect for storing Nintendo DS games. It can fit up to 150 games. (less if you use the dividers). I am very happy with this product.
4,Just Part of the Blueprint for Nirvana,"There is roudiness in here. Black Francis coos and snarls in a way in which Kurt Cobain would just do. Cobain played along with Francis' way, as shown in his band Nirvana. Such wonderful and raunchy tracks include the Spanish introduction in ""Vamos"", ""Isla de Encanta""(you can hear Mrs. John Murphy singing softly in this one as background vocalist), and ""I've Been Tired"", the song featured subtly in M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" in which ""Mr. Glass"" is down in mood at a comic book store. The song is heard over the intercom."
5,More like five-illion stars.,This is to rock'n'roll what the cantata bwv 82 is to classical music: the one work that dwarves and runs circle around any possible contenders.
5,Math On Call,Best suplimental math book ever. I use it all the time in my math class and I recommend that parents buy it for my students to help their children at home.
5,What a great resource!!!,Math On Call is simply a great resource that every teacher that teaches mathematics at any level should have on their desk. It is very easy to use.
5,Justice,"An enjoyable read! A timely story that may remind one of actual characters on the national scene in the recent past. The ending leaves you with a feeling that justice was done. If you like mystery and politics, you need to read Fatal Impeachment."
1,wrong product,I keep ordering the large post card size and keep getting the very small teeny business card size. I finally just gave up and choose not to spend any more money on this product
2,It's no North Dallas 40,"Having enjoyed both North Dallas 40 and other titles by Peter Gent, I was surprised to find this particular title somewhat lacking. Of course, it is a reprisal of the characters we met in the original ND40 but quite a few years have passed and the lives of the main characters are not quite the same as they were. I would have prefered if the last impression we had of them would have been from ND40. The follow up wasn't needed."
1,A pedantic work to be read with a dictionary or just skip it,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I thought it would reflect some information useable in the daily application of the advertising or PR trade as I am a consultant. Although it shows ""Advertising, Public Relations...""as part of its subtitle on the cover, very few chapters actually pertain to either. And those that appear are merely historical tracings of people like the author's pet, Bill Bernbach and his agency. The use of hightened vocabulary was not necessary. It was as if the authors were showing off their linguistic prowess rather than reaching their general audience. I should have known better than to buy this book when I read the reviews from MIT, Princeton...need I say more about ""ivory tower"" scholarship."
3,NICOLAS IS OK,CAGE IS AN OUTSTANDING ACTOR AND SHOULD PICK BETTER MOVIES TO STAR INWHY WOULD ANY ONE WANT TO DRIVE ANGRY?
4,3D-elicious!,"Okay, You about to see some SPECTACULAR 3D effects! I have a collection of 3D Blu-Ray movies, and this one was the best by far. Beside the 3D quality, I enjoyed & loved the movie too. The massage was ""hella"" good, ha!Drive Angry [Blu-ray 3D]"
4,Good 3D Movie,"Drive Angry, good movie if you are looking for a 3D movie,the story of the movie is ok,Mr.Cage has done better movies!,but the 3D is worth it,not the best 3D,but good enough..and it has some scenes that are so dumb that it's funny!..it's like a grind house movie,if you like Robert Rodgriuez movies or Quentin Tarantino...you will like this!..and don't forget the 3D!..makes it better!..I give the movie 3.5 stars and the 3D 4 stars."
4,Gotta Love Nick Cage!,I just love Nick Cage in just about anything he does. I liked the story line and movie. A man escaping from Hell to avenge his daughter and stop the murder of his grandchild. Gotta love it!
4,good action,"3D home theatres are new, and hard to find suitable movies to view with them. but this movie was well suited to the 3D format, with lots of action to take advantage of the 3D capabilities...stuff flew out of the screen at me, i like it."
5,Out of the typical...,"Open your mind and let this movie give a different experience to you;explosive,dynamic,espectacular and Nicholas Cage giving one of his best perfomances of his career.This movie could be classified as a combination of ""Gone In 60 Seconds"",""Hell Ride"" by Grindhouse releases with no imagination limits."
3,3 stars = it's okay,"Yup, that's about it... it's okay. Love cheesy horror flicks, B movies, car movies, etc so this is watchable. Is it a movie I would watch again and again... um nah, just didn't hit me that way but hey it was alright.... Just so you can have a reference to my tastes: Army of Darkness is one I could watch again and again so if your tastes are like mine then go ahead and spend the buck to rent it from Redbox... wouldn't buy."
2,Drive Angry,Im a big movie person this one caught my eye. keep it short acting was bad. story plot good but the acting did not cut it.
2,Good / Ok Movie But Not So Good 3D,"If your getting this for the blu ray 3D save your money. I have a Samsung 55"" Led 3D un55d7000 240 hz TV. This movie didn't look so good in 3D. I enjoyed the movie but the 3d was bad, There where some cool scenes with some good effects but over all I was disappointed with the 3D. I really hope the studios can start making some good live action films that pop, I know it can be done I watch the imax river 3d movie and the opening scene with the bubbles blew my mind, if only other studios could make scenes like that."
1,Beyond Redemption,"This movie was GOD-AWFUL. The characters and script were shamelessly over-the-top. The special effects were sub-par. The ending was only matched in caliber by the joke of an introduction. Cage must really be regretting this film, but given his performance he deserves regret. The only (I can't say 'redeeming' because the film is entirely beyond redemption) element was the performance by the ""Accountant"" sent to reclaim Cage's soul."
2,seriously poor movie,"Good 'ol Nick Cage is out there making any movie he can to pay off his enormous debt and this movie is proof of that. Poor script, his acting in this movie is down and its really a very cheesy movie overall. They throw in some nudity and car scenes to attract an audience. But if you over 30 I doubt you'll like this movie."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution --SPOILER FREE REVIEW","SPOILER FREE REVIEWI'm a Nicholas Cage fan and despite very solid performances by Nicholas Cage, Amber Head, and William Fichtner, they could not save a bad script and horrible direction.I think this movie is a great example of having a good idea but being unable to execute effectively.The premise and plot are very interesting however the script was not cohesive and the direction could not quite find the right balance between being bad ass over the top and being grounded enough to connect us to the characters.Some parts of the movie come off as cartoonish, some as if it should be on Jack Ass, some as if it should be on Airplane... basically the movie is just a giant mess.But even with all that, I think the actors did a phenonmenal job. So IMO, its just not their fault, but rather a bad script and horrible direction.amnightus"
1,A waste of time and money for both the studio and you!,Not even the hotness of Amber Heard can save this turd of a flick! DO NOT see it! You won't be missing anything!
1,Worst 3D movie-EVER!,"Besides the fact that this was one of the worst 3D movies I've ever seen, it was the worst Nick Cage movie I've ever seen!! Totally pointless story. I'm normally not bothered by nudity and violence in a film, if there's a point!!! Don't waste your time!"
1,AWFUL!!!!,My title says it all....Cage ought to hang his head really low for agreeing to do this one..It stunk....the trick is if you don't have a plot or just want to tantalize...then make a film like this. Hang down your head Tom Dull....oh wait...Cage!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I did and turned it off after about 10 minutes
1,"3D fine, Movie not garbage? Invite mom & dad and gram to watch!",I bought this movie to watch 3D action. It did but the movie was garbage.Try inviting parents and grandparents to watch with you!
1,Don't do it,"I hoped I had found a gem, Boy was I wrong. This should be labeled a horror movie. Because it is a horrid, horrid, movie. It makes no sense it deserves to be placed in hell where the main characters go in the end. The chases are dumb they waste some great cars for no good reason. The plot is crazy. It could have used more sex and less pretense that way it could have been classified as porn. This movie is an insult to porn."
1,"One word, YUCK!","Being a huge Nic Cage fan I was disappointed that he would make a movie this bad. I mean yeah, he's had some stinkers in the past but this one surpasses it all of them in the ""awful movie"" genre. I did read some of the reviews on the rental site and knew it had a mostly low rating, but really figured I'd get past the blown off limbs, afterall, I did all watch Saving Private Ryan with all it's bloody limbs. This one had bad acting, bad script, it's just plain bad, ugh! Guess there will always be some who will like trash like this, those will find this review ""not helpful"" just to defend this horrid mistake of a movie. Believe the majority of reviews for this one and stay away unless you're an 18-26 year old guy who relish the type of violence gaming companies put out these days. It was so bad I to turn it off after the first 15 minutes, what a waste."
1,Pretty Sick,"This is a really sick movie. Lot of gore, foul language, limbs torn off, offensive in more ways than you can count. Pointless destruction from the beginning to the end.Nicholas Cage is a good actor and has made many good movies, just one example being Lord of War. In this movie he is good, but just about every person in the movie gets killed before the end of the movie. It is a fantasy, but why is the devil Accountant? What is the devil worship anyway? Why are they trying to kill the child? Nicholas Cage's character kills countless number of people in order to save a single baby. How does that make any sense?Each to his own I guess. For me I just did not like this movie."
3,It made me fairly happy,"Drive Angry definitely has some problems. The plot has some large points I feel should have been cleared up and the pacing is a bit uneven. But Nick Cage does a good job of kicking ass and Amber Heard created a surprisingly likable character. I had my doubts about her role in this film but she kind of impressed me.Also, the movie is silly and over the top. I like that. There is one particular shootout that had me laughing the whole time - you'll know it when you see it. Fire this one up on one of those nights you have nothing else to do."
3,"Movie is okay, 3D is solid.","If you're looking for a vendetta movie where Nicolas Cage goes cross country with his beautiful co-star, with plenty of decent driving, stunts and gun fights, and a cool William Fichtner as a matrix-like special Agent sent to capture Cage, then this is worth checking out. The story is bare bones though, and nothing to get excited about, but the pacing and action deliver a decent experience with some neat moments. The driving, for all of Nic Cage's supposed skill behind the wheel, is only average at best thanks mostly due to its slower pace.The 3D is the real star here, and is executed as well as one could hope. The 3D stands out, so the foreground, mid and background pop out from each other, creating a very convincing illusion of depth. This was filmed with two cameras, not post converged (though post converged 3D can be just as good if done right).So if you own a 3DTV and could use a gritty, decent action movie with great 3D, this is worth a look."
5,GREAT GREAT TWISTED MOVIE,"Pure Fun In A Very Twisted, Bad Ass, And Funny Way. Nick Cage Rules This Film And He Will Stop At nothing To Find His Daughter.What's Not To Like About That.It's Entertainment At It's Very Best. So Let Your Mind Go And Enjoy The Ride!No Seat belt Required"
5,"""Effing Awesome"" and Raw","Wow - The story is fantastic, the acting is good overall, and phenomenal by Nicolas Cage. Amber Heard plays a fabulous tough girl with a heart - and she's a really good badass chick, IMO. There's a couple of scenes that definitely entitle this to its R rating, along with the language. The action just keeps on going, with a few short moments of back story. There's enough twists to keep strong interest, and enough predictability to make you right in your anticipation, enough craziness to last all night long. While I don't know how to write reviews, I really love the movie and strongly recommend it to people who like action and some darkness, nonsense and wonder."
2,Stay Away!,"from this film.This is the worst Nick Cage movie I've seen,yes,even worse than The Wicker Man.The only good thing about this movie was the cool cars.Hollywood seems to have this stupid idea that if they throw in sex,pretty women and hot cars,they don't have to worry about anything else and this is one of the worst if not the worst 3D movie I've seen.Hollywood needs to stop making these type of movies."
4,DON'T TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY & IT SHOULD BE A GOOD RIDE,"This feels much like a ""B"" movie on a ""A"" movie budget. It's a tried and true supernatural tale with lots of gore, swearing and driving and the action is pretty good as well. Amber Heard's spunky character is fun to watch as she gets into fist fight after fist fight with men but her rationale for continuing with the main character is hit or miss at best. But, to be fair, you can't take this movie too seriously and enjoy it at the same time so you have to just roll with it. Old automobile aficionados will appreciate some of the rides in this picture. The blonde in the motel with Cage during the gunfight was cleverly hilarious and the Devil's Accountant was arguably the most colorful character. WHEN WATCHED: mid June 2011; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; ACTION: B to B plus; HUMOR: B; OVERALL GRADE: B."
4,Great Movie!,"I love this movie. Sure the plot is a little light, but this movie is highly entertaining. Action, adventure, limited special effects. I am also a huge fan of ""The Accountant"". The part was played very well. This is just an overall good time guy flick."
1,beware,"Many of the older DVD's are Subtitles with SDH, which means TV Guardian will NOT take out the fowl language-this is a do-not buy for me and after recieving I threw where it belongs,,in the garbage"
3,good action-good 3D-good price,"Full of action,plus Nick Cage is pretty good in this one(he has made some stinkers recently),all in all, a good b rated thrill ride.The 3D was good,not great and the price is right.I enjoy the good animated 3D movies(Coraline being the heavyweight champion)but I also enjoy a ""real people""3D movie,and this one is pretty good.)"
2,not for prime time,"If you enjoy 3D views of extreme gunshot damage, you may be in luck. Throw in a liking for some general low class behavior scenes by the leading woman, and general violence from start to finish and this movie might be for you. If you think it is a high speed driving movie in 3d.... it's not. It's closer to a combination of some of the recent vampire fare coupled with an End of Days tweak. I didn't expect much, but bought it because it was 3d. I still was disappointed. Cage probably did what he could with the part, but it was an uphill battle that he couldn't win. Oh, well, it was selling at a discounted price."
5,Movie Received As Stated.,I received the move as new in the package. As stated in the details of the selling page. I was happy with the price. The price was very reasonable. I was very satisfied. Thank You
3,Drive Angry Blu-Ray,Fantastic visual effects but not the greatest movie ever I am afraid.Lots of action and I am sure will be loved by some but I did not really find the story on message.
1,Ugh!,"I've always been a Nicolas Cage fan but now I must reconsider if he continues to do flicks like this. The acting is beyond hammy. My husband loves shoot 'em up movies and everything in the movie's description. However, after about 15 minutes of sheer agony, we turned the movie off and promptly returned it to Redbox. My husband was laughing and kept commenting on how ""stupid"" the movie was and wanted to shut it off. It fell very short of even being entertaining. Laughable...yes. Sad for Nicolas Cage to have his name associated with it....Definitely!Don't waste your money! After reading the other comments, I'm very glad we didn't get past the first 15 minutes. Evidentally and unbelievably....it did get worse."
1,Nic Cage Needs Paycheck,"...and I understand that he is in deep financial trouble, but why this? This is a shameless, violent and unnecessary piece of trash that is by far, THE WORST FILM OF 2011. Run away from this!"
2,drive angry made me angry,"I will not go into too much detail about the movie except that it made me angry because the story line is awful. The acting was awful. The gore shown in this movie will keep you interested at best. The actor's performance was less than stellar. I would recommend you spend no more than a buck to rent this flick. The four bucks I spend on this on-demand rental would have been well spent drinking an ice cold delicious ale instead. Well good luck for those that do not heed this recommendation it is your money, your choice, your opinion so good luck fellows and fellas."
1,Would not call this entertainment,"In every movie, Nicolas Cage has seemed to act in the same monotonous, boring way. In this movie it was even WORSE. As others have described, if you're looking for a movie with nudity and blood you should waste two hours of your life on this one."
1,Kick-Little Toe,"(1.) Still another example of an aging actor not role challenging himself but declining towards the money.(2.) Ripoff storyline of someone coming back from the dead with a revengeful stalking of the representatives of evil (i.e. Satan with his always present alternative names). Can't they be a bit more creative than bon fires and baby sacrifices? And, the usual cheap money maker of flying bullets, pointless sex scene and the getting-old-fast 'n furious driving. Then we have the typecast human looking types with God like powers always showing them off in trivial pointless ways. (Why? Just to have filler visuals for the film.) They always seem to lose anyway. You would think that with their superior capabilities that they would just do the job and leave but then there wouldn't be a movie.(3.) For some reason older cars must bring in a lot of nostalgia money because they always show up in abundance in these type of movies. If you ever drove one you wouldn't want to again."
2,Cant believe it was not a good movie.,"How do you have a movie with Nicholas Cage, loads of nudity, tons of violence, deamons, shot guns that shoot deamons, and a Dodge Charger be such a horrible movie. I work in brazil, and as there was nothing else on in english i had the privledge of watching this whole movie. ( which i would not suggest ) The effects were decent, and it did have action in it, but the dialog was nothing but horrible trash talk, and i think it was directed by a 12 year old. I would rather buy a box of salt to pour into my eyes than be forced to watch this movie again."
5,gave it five stars even though the story sucks,This movie couldn't have been more corny. But be because I have a 3d TV now I am willing to take risks to enjoy some 3d action. I don't regret purchasing Drive Angry. It's now part of my 3d collection.
4,drive angry,"Not a big Nicolas Cage fan, but I absolutely loved drive angry. Very fast paced with enough action for any adrenaline junkie."
4,A must for Cage fans! (only?),"Lots of action, very typical, outrageously ridiculous and unbelievable plot for Cage & Company. Total entertainment with no thinking involved! Excellent for what it is! If you are a Cage fan with an open imagination to fantasy and Cage silliness, you will like this movie. If not, don't buy it!."
1,Wished I would have seen the bad reviews before watching!,"No Stars if possible. This movie shows no Morals what so ever. I like NIcholas Cage's acting but this movie is horrible. If you have no morals than you probably would like this. But me, it had too much I don't give a f#** attitude, which I don't like! Is this what the world is coming to. I wish they'd make some good clean action movies that wouldn't be bad if the kids walked in the room."
3,good but...,"Overall I thought this movie was good, but it had more nudity than I cared for and the usually bad language that I have gotten used to excepting. Still the avenging angel from hell has been done before by him...ghostrider."
2,Expected better,"Nicolas Cage can be hot and cold. He has some great movies like raising arizona, but has some realy duds too. If your getting this for the blu ray 3D then its not worth it. I have a Samsung 53"" Led TV. This movie didn't look so great in 3D. I watched the movie but the 3d was bad, There where some cool scenes with some good effects but over all I was disappointed with the 3D. I really hope the studios can start making some good live action films that pop, I know it can be done I watch the imax river 3d movie and the opening scene with the was a big suprise, if only the movie could be more consistanly good.."
2,Why did i buy a other Nicholas Cage movie?,"I don't know but I think this time I learned my lesson. This movie is a waste of money and time, both of which I will never get back. Stupid cheesy 3d effects, terrible special effects (explosions superimposed, being able to easily tell it was shot using the green screen) don't waste the time with this."
5,dr,"Action packed, typical cage movie. the acting was good could have pick a better person for female lead, but a good movie, enjoyed it."
3,Hmm,"Seller was awesome, but had this listed in 3D movies.... It's not! DVD in good shape just not that good of a movie. Will do in a pinch though"
4,Non stop action.,"Entertaining, a bit on the graphic side at times but its the movie that just keeps on giving! A few absolutley gross scenes aside I would rate as a cool movie, just plain cool."
5,works for us,"I have a 5, 3 and 6 week old and have been really happy with this stroller. It maneuvers well, my 3 year old really enjoys it and overall we are really happy. I had a double before this and I wish this had been available 3 years ago. I've only had it a couple weeks so I hope it continues to work as it has already."
2,Does not last long and Hard to Push,"Within a year of using this stroller a metal bar completely broke off of the bottom which helped attach the front seat belt. From use it has become very difficult to push. My children are not even that big for it to have worn out so fast! Not good for long term or extensive use. It really is very, very difficult to push on regular flat surfaces for even a very short period of time."
5,Love it! Worth the extra money!,"I love this stroller! I spent a lot of time researching all my options, I have a 1 year old and a 4 year old. My 4 year old is so happy with it too! The stroller folds up and down easily, is pretty lightweight compared to the other sit-n-stand strollers, and I love all the pockets in the parent organizer. It moves and turns so smoothly too! My opinion is don't buy the Baby Trend or the regular Caboose - this one is the best of the three! Great stroller overall, my only complaint is that the bench itself does not seem to stay in place very well. My child's feet also slip off the platform when she is sitting on the bench, I'd like to see a lip on the outer part of the platform, not just the inside. Great buy though, I am very happy!"
1,Try it out before you buy,"My wife read all of the reviews for this stroller prior to the birth of our second child and decided to purchase this stroller online. It is, by far, the worst stroller that I have ever used. The dimensions are such that it is rather tall and skinny so it has a tendency to be difficult to turn when you want to, but driveway slopes tend to force you down into the street if you are not holding on very tightly. As far as looks, ease of folding, and overall features are concerned, it is a fine product. I am a healthy 34-year old dad who finds this really difficult to maneuver. I wouldn't even think of trying to take it to a crowded place or store. Who knows, maybe I just got a dud, but I would recommend trying this out at a store before purchasing."
3,Groovy Joovy?,"We purchased this item on a ""gold box"" sale and got a very good price through Amazon! While I was concerned that it might not fit our Graco Snugride baby carrier due to earlier reviews (whew - it does!), I guess I should have also been concerned about the lack of room for my toddler who rides along on the back. When the baby carrier is affixed to the front, my poor toddler literally has to bend forward in order to sit down on the back! I can't wait until they are both able to face forward so my toddler isn't robbed of precious room! Other than that, I think my 2 year old is a little young to grasp the stand / sit concept..."
4,Easy to use and strong,"I got this to replace my Graco Duoglider. I have an almost 2 year old who sits up front and a 3.5 year old who sits or stands on the back. I have found it to be light and the kids like it. It is easy to steer and push. It folds quite small and easy to open/fold and transport.The only things I don't like are, that you need to put the brake on both back wheels, it would be much better to have one brake. Also with folding you have to lift either side therefore needing two hands. The basket underneath would be easier to use if the back of it was also elasticated (the sides are). I often have my 5 year old ride on the back aswell as my 3.5 year old. They squish up together to sit on the seat. It is still easy to push like this as the weight is on the back. It feels very sturdy and safe, the children are certainly putting it to the test as they are all always climbing in and out."
5,Great product for a large family,"We have five children from nine years down to one. We purchased this product because of it's ease of use and ultralight weight. Any one of our children can ride in the rear seat making it an enjoyable experience where ever we go. The front seat allows our one year old to sit high, making him feel like he is always part of the group. The basket has been great at holding anything we need. I especially loved the hidden feature on the upper part of the bar. The wide black band that goes across the top is actually storage compartment with two drink holders, a zipper compartment for small things like hotel keys or cell phones, and the center of the band can hold a wallet that is well tucked and hidden. I was pleasantly surprised by this stroller. Strangers have approached me asking and I tell them great things. We ordered the ""Sunset."" My only worry is that we won't be able to keep it clean, although, cookie messes have wiped right off so far."
4,Love this Stroller,"We purchased this stroller for our 3 1/2 and 1 year old. This is the best stroller we have owed. My 3 1/2 loves the option of sitting, standing or walking. The weight of riders is evenly distributed making pushing this stroller a breaze. When both children are on board, you do need two hands to push. We purchased this stroller in Sunset and what a great color- easy to identify/find. The canopy is great and the fact that it covers both kids is even better. The downside to this stroller is the basket underneath is small and you are not able to store much. The stroller is definitely lightweight and can easily load in the SUV."
5,Great stroller for travel,"We had to travel several times this winter, one of which being Disney World. I normally use a side-by-side double stroller, but wanted a smaller, easier, more convenient stroller for the airport and the park. This stroller was so affordable, and so lightweight!! My toddler loved her 'big girl' seat in the back, too. Definitely worth it!"
5,Amazing!,"I have never written a review despite shopping on Amazon for years but this stroller is so amazing I had to share. This is the fifth stroller we have bought and so far the only one that has met expectations. We have a 2.5 yr old and an 11 month old. It is very easy to maneuver, and shorter than a traditional tandem. The sunshade is brilliant, it actually covers both children completely--something no other stroller we own does. The Ultralight is worth the money and extra features in my opinion. I cannot say enough good things about it, a great buy!"
4,great product..only 1 complaint,"We really love this stroller - it makes taking our 2 month old and 3 year old out easier. There is plenty of room for both of them. It is pretty lightweight for a tandem and there is plenty of storage space. The parent caddy that comes with it is a great idea! Very easy to open and close and easy to maneuver. The only complaint is that it is quite bulky and long when folding with the canopy and car seat attachment. We end up having to remove both of these each time before putting it in the car, so it becomes a bit of a pain taking them off and putting them on each time...Otherwise we highly recommend!"
4,Excellent product,We absolutely love this stroller with only one exception.... it desperately needs more storage. Our prior one-child stroller had nearly twice the underneath storage area.The construction seems solid and our 3 year old loves riding in the back while her sister's car seat/carrier fits perfectly in the front.
3,Average,"I must have the exceptional children. This is a great stroller but my youngest is 20 months and the front seat is too shallow for him, he's a tall guy. His legs dangel out almost touching the ground. The foot shelf is too narrow for him to use. My older son is almost 5 and he loves to sit or stand, but sitting his head touches the canopy, so he has to duck down. When they are both in it, it does strain to one side, especially if the sidewalk is a little slanted, as most are.I use it every day for the school run. It is perfect for that but I don't use it any longer than that."
1,Very poor construction! Not enough storage!,I bought this stroller when I was expecting my second son. My older son was 3 at the time. After having it for less than 1 year it has completely fallen apart. I have to hold the hinges together with cable ties which frequently break. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who has a son (or daughter) who can get out of the back seat on their own. This was obviously not design for typical wear and tear. I still have my single seat Graco and it is great condition.
4,Great stroller but could use some improvements.,I really like this stroller however the basket could be a little larger and easier to get too. It does not have a standard cup holder but mine came with one and it would be great if it had a harder one. I understand that it needs to be soft for your little one but they could put it to the outside of the stroller towards you that way it won't get in the way of your little one standing or getting in/out of the stroller. Very light weight stroller and that's great. We recently took it on a weekend trip and I have no complaints about the weight or how it handles. As explained before it could use some improvements with other things.
3,"Its great, but...","I agree with all the reviews, it really is a nice, solid, well-built, easy to fold and store stroller. However, I was disappointed after using it for 1 year, because my 14 month old outgrew the front seat. She was a little large for a 14 month old, but not gargantuan. The seat isn't very deep, and she tends to slide forward. We put the foot rest up to help with that, but her legs are getting too long for that now. When I bought it, I though I would use it until she was over 2 years old, but I only got one good year and a few months out of it..."
3,Not so great for tall toddlers,"I am a little disappointed with the stroller after having read so many great reviews. I bought it for my 21 month old and 3 year old. I have to agree that the stroller is light for a double and easy to maneuver. However, the front seat is shallow and the foot shelf is too high and narrow. My 21 month old daughter is tall for her age (maybe the size of most 2 year olds) - her feet dangle past the foot rest and drag against the front wheels. My 3 year old son does NOT fit in the front seat at all - his feet drag the ground. He does like the back quite a bit - it gives him the freedom to sit or stand, and get off and on whenever he likes. Also, the tray is hard to attach and detach. I was really hoping that this stroller would last a couple years till my son can/is willing to walk everywhere, but I'm not sure how long we'll be able to keep it since the front space is so limited."
4,Anekdoten - Another Strong Release,"It has been several years since there was a new Anekdoten album so fans have been waiting for this one for a while. The sound is similar to the band's earlier albums with a King Crimson meets early Pink Floyd sound to much of it. All of the tracks range in the three to seven minute range so nothing stretches out too long. The mellotron is ever present as is the crunchy guitar and atmospheric keyboards. The vocals have never been Anekdoten's strong point, but they do have a certain charm to them and after a while you get used to the style. Highlights of the album include ""The Great Unknown"", ""A Sky About To Rain"", ""In For A Ride"", and ""Prince Of The Ocean"". If you are already a fan of Anekdoten, this album should be a must purchase. If you are not a fan this album won't do much to change your mind. Overall this is another strong release from one another bright light on the Swedish progressive rock scene."
4,Good relaxing album,"I like this music alot. It is mostly mellow with a kind of jam band vibe. Kind of like Opeth's gentler moments. Anyway, the only reason I'm deducting a star is because this music makes me sleepy and I can't listen to it in my car or I'll die."
1,"""mickey mouse"" quality","We also bought this at Target. Bulky, cluncky, and cheap dvd player. Picture was ok on main unit, on the second unit the picture was too dark and the controls for the brightness and color were only on the second unit and did not effect the main unit. This does not come with a battery! Must be plugged in to use. We looked at this for taking on a upcoming long road trip and this will not cut it. :( Also packaging states that it comes with 4 different interchangeable graphics. It only comes with 2 patterns (x 2 units) made on flimsy cardboard. One design is tinkerbell and the other is the pirates of the caribbean skull. We returned this."
1,Broke after 5 months,"Do not buy this portable DVD player. I have called Disney, Target, and Disney event transferred me to Memorex customer service for help. Memorex doesn't even make these players and never has, so that was 2 hours wasted on the phone. I bought this player online and did not know about the extended warranty, otherwise I would have bought it. We have only used this thing about 5 times and it has been well cared for. This was a special treat for my kids to finally get a portable DVD player and now it is broken and I feel like Target and Disney have ripped us off. I would feel better shopping on ebay from a seller with a 5 star rating than I would buying another expensive product from Disney. I am very disappointed and feel let down by Disney Corp."
2,Don't buy this piece of junk!!!,"I bought this at Target June 2008 because it was on sale. I thought$147 was a great price. I got it home and it looked like a quality product. I set it up and the picture was great. However, the remote control stopped working the day I bought the system. I took it back to Target, they exchanged it and brought the 2nd one home. The remote worked on this one, however, the 2nd screen jumped evertime the voices spoke and then the first screen stopped after 15 minutes and had strange vertical lines on the screen. I will take this back tomorrow!!! Don't waste your time!!!"
1,Disney Quality? No Way!,"I am on my 3rd portable DVD player and I am not happy. The 1st Emerson lasted 1 week. The 2nd Emerson lasted 4 months (warranty was only 3 months). This Disney player, which I was hoping would be of better quality, lasted a whopping 6 months (warranty was only 3 months also). We really liked this player from the start. Picture was fine, sound was fine, seemed durable, everything I was hoping for, especially for the price. What do you really expect for $139? I did expect it to last longer than 6 months though. The second screen went blank. The sound is still there, but no picture. I'm not happy, but at least we still have the main player left. Maybe that will last a few more months. This set was NOT abused in any way. It was very well cared for. I doubt if I will buy any more Disney players."
1,Piece of Junk - Don't Buy!!!!,This thing is a piece of junk!!! We bought this at Target 2 years ago. We've used it maybe 10 times on 3-hr car trips and the thing just quit working. Won't read the DVD. DO NOT BUY!!!!
3,Very dissappointed,"I first bought the Jim Shore Nativity Snow Globe about four years ago. After two years, the light would no longer turn on even after I tried several sets of batteries. About three years ago, I bought the ""Magic Takes Flight"" Musical Masterpiece and last year the spring in the battery compartment broke of and now it cannot no longer light. This year as I put it away, the antler came off. The same year, I bought the tall sitting Rudolph of the Red Nose Reindeer with bells which the nose flashes with a photo sensor. Needless to say, after many battery changes, it works randomly at best. I emailed the company and the best reply they could come up with is they would notify their marketing department. That was it. I was not happy, This is not a complicated function on all three of the items I purchased totaling approximatetly $300.00. I'm done with Jim Shore products."
3,depends on your preferences,"pros:-great value, for $20 including S&H;-easy access countdown timer with alarm, no other watch has thiscons:-buttons are hard to press-the looks could be improveddepends:-the screen is very small and hard to read for someone with poor eyesight"
5,excellent product! I love it!,"I'm manager in a fast food restaurant, and this watch have been very helpful to me, I use it to set the break-meals of my employees in it, in a fast way. It's very convenient because I have a lot of things to think about in my position, and thanks this watch I don't have to worry about the breaks."
1,Slow and expensive shipping,"The watch was fine - but I checked out using Amazon one-step checkout and found - after having the order automatically submitted - that this company charged 10.95 to ship a 5 ounce watch that cost $9.95. Not only that, I placed my order on December 7th and received the watch some time around December 21st - two weeks later. I will not purchase items from this vendor again! Be sure and check shipping charges before you order!"
4,Not a Bad Movie at All,"Playing like a chilling short story, an intriguing central relationship between the leads makes up for what it lacks in pace or impact. Could be better, but could've been MUCH worse."
3,"""Pretty Good Supernatural Thriller!""","Anthony Hopkins, Colin O'Donoghue and Alice Braga starin this 2011 supernatural thriller based on true events.A seminary student loses his faith and questions itwhen he's sent to help an exorcist priest. This ispretty good and Anthony is terrific as usual. Thisdvd has nice picture and sound, but only deletedscenes. I still recommend this."
2,Disappointment,"As to whether he movie's true to the book, how many adaptions really are? This is strictly or the movie: The Rite is one of those films that starts out very well, laying the groundwork for what could've been a scary,atmospheric, tense nail-biter. Unfortunately, a little less thnt halfway through, it reverts to using a few updated tricks/nuances from The Exorcist, and ultimately slips into a confusing morass that simply doesn't make any sense and frankly, becomes close to boring. A shame, given the quality of the actors. It would be nice to see this re-done as the kind of film it could've been, but it won't happen. Worth missing, or watching only for free. with the FF button handy."
4,Awesome Movie,This is a very entertaining and thought provoking movie about a young man who is close to taking his final vows into priesthood who is sent to the Vatican to take a course on exocism. He soon hooks up with and accompanies a very well known and experienced priest (Anthony Hopkins) who shows him what it is all about. The main character Michael is unsure of his faith and very stubborn on his beliefs. I wont ruin anythng for you but this is a very good film for both the believer and skeptic. Also this is based on a true story.
2,YAWN!,"There was never any suspense or excitement in this movie... At the climax of the film, I kept expecting something else to happen... It never did... it just ended... The prominant review on the back of the cover said it was ""The Best film about exorcism since The Exorcist""... To even compare it to ""The Exorcist"" is a crime. I think Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors, but despite his skills, the film was a failure.. Not worth the purchase.."
1,"Recommending ""The Rite"" is Setting the Bar Too Low","Despite claims to the contrary, this movie - inspired by Matt Baglio'sThe Rite: The Making of a Modern ExorcistDOES sensationalize. The real life, middle-aged priest learning about exorcism of the book becomes the mid 20ish, GQ-looking seminarian of the movie. The character of Matt Baglio himself has become a female journalist, with whom you're wondering if the seminarian will become inappropriately involved. This sort of a plot line is standard, insulting Hollywood crap.PERHAPS, this movie treats Catholicism with a bit more respect than other Hollywood fare. Yet to recommend it is setting the bar entirely too low."
2,Could be better,"Anthony Hopkins is a good actor, but he has remained the same for quite a few movies, including this one. Story-line was weak. The supporting actor was actually good; I expect to see him in more movies. In general, you won't miss much if you pass this one."
4,"Very Good Movie, An Anthony Hopkins I havent seen since his Hannibal movie series days","Id like to start out by saying idk why youd see this if you don't beleive in the paranormal or demons. This movie was very good I liked the detail of just because you don't beleive in the devil doesnt mean it doesnt exist mentality, great acting and storyline. This is a great movie about exorcism and belongs right in there would recommend to anyone into these type of movies."
4,Thumbs Up!,This movie was so much more than I had hoped for. The acting was fantastic and the story did put a scare into me. Who better than Hopkins for that? Thumbs up.
4,I BELIEVE,"This film is very frightening to me, because, I believe in the struggle of good and evil... God the Father and Satan and his legion, the fallen angels. This is a top notch film with the always excellent Anthony Hopkins, who once again acts his ass off! He takes this movie from a boring first half hour to excitement the rest of the way through. Not because there are a landslide of explosive special effects, but because his acting is an open pit of roaring flames! He is passionate and believable. This film deals with demon possession to a level of frightening belief. The film boasts based on true events, and always with that boast, I'm sure there is a boat load of untruth... However, being that I am of faith, there is plenty here to agree with and come away thinking and pondering my faith and lack thereof in the end. Unless you have nerves of steel or can just laugh when it comes to the thought of heaven and hell.... God and Satan. I'm sure you will enjoy."
3,Anthony Hopkins is always a pleasure to see,"This film is a good thrill. Anthony Hopkins fans - like myself - I think will enjoy it. Technically, a seminarian would never be performing an exorcism. Usually this kind of stuff is done by priests with experience and a lot of discernment.The story is interesting, but I wouldn't say there is any spectacular plot, etc. No - I think the subject is interesting, even if all of the theology is hardly brilliant: but not a bad film to watch on a Saturday afternoon."
3,No Breaks Allowed,"Mi esposa y yo siempre hacemos un intermediodespues de 45-50 minutos de pelicula.Sin embargo, esta pelicula nos capto laatencion desde el inicio ...Aun, comienza un poco lento ... pero yadespues se convierte en muy intrigantever el desarollo del cuento ...El actor principal es de mis favoritos yaqui se destaca."
2,Not nearly as good as expected,"I was mostly disappointed with this movie. They seemed to copy a few ""ideas"" from The Exorcist, such as the older and younger priest and a few other things, but none of the great parts. I think Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, but not so much in this movie, which could have been the role he had to play. I expected it to be more on the scary side and more possessions, but was very disappointed. There are a few funny parts and a few good parts, but overall, I wish I rented instead of bought."
1,Hopkin's should be ashamed,"I can't believe this movie is getting any positive reviews...Anthony Hopkins should be ashamed for even having his name associated with this debacle. I love horror movies and the Excorcist made me sleep with the light on for a month...this movie just made me sleep. ""Inspired"" by true events, much in the way Donald Trump was ""inspired"" that he had a full head of hair, the movie is based on a factual book about a priest training to be an excorcist (factual from the Catholic point of view anyway). I happened to have read the book just before the movie was announced and found it to be interesting, but couldn't see how it could be made into a good movie...I still don't see how it could be made into a good movie...a lousey movie?...yes, point made...but certainly not enjoyable in any sense of the world. Still, if you're into stupid, unbelieveable plots, this could be your film...the only thing I enjoyed while watching the Rite was the popcorn."
1,"Wow! So, so very bad","I guess Anthony Hopkins has reached that point in his career where quality no longer matters. What a shame. He's so good. He's the reason I rented this awful movie. I love horror flicks and have a pretty big collection; and I'm not that fussy. It doesn't take that much for a horror movie to entertain me. This one, The Rite, is the exception. I rented it on demand video, then even after they offered me a big chunk of money off to buy it, I turned it down. I don't need this reject in my horror collection. This is just plain bad. I'm sure Hopkins is just counting his $ and doesn't care what I think. Too bad. He was one of my favorites."
3,Rituals,"I loved the cast. Anthony Hopkins is always an excellent actor. I was excited about the storyline, but the movie just fell a bit flat. I don't feel the story was well developed, skipped around a bit and I lost focus in the characters. I usually love exorcism movies, but this one I really can't recommend as story was not scary, did not keep me involved."
4,Good Demonic Thriller,"I read the book first. Anthony Hopkins delivers a powerfull performance. The movie foloowed the book closely till the last 10 minutes. And then artistic freedom intervined. But the end was still very good and a real thriller. If you like a good demonic thriller, this is the one."
2,Time to retire,Anothony Hopkins has grown very tired. his character was pretty burned out in this bad pick of running out of good film materialscript. Who else would play his part? the Pope if things got slow at the Vatican.
3,Kept waiting for the movie to start,"I appreciate much of the work that Anthony Hopkins does. This is no exception. I think, after all the previous excorcist themed movies and AH's flair for the dramatic this was a let down, or more accurately an up that never got there. There are a couple of creepy scenes with a girl AH's is trying to help but overall the movie seemed uncommitted to whether demons can possess people or not. Colin O'Donoghue is pleasant in his variable belief and you want him to make it, whichever way he decides to go but, again, he just seems to glide through the movie bumping into the other characters in the movie.Worth renting if you've seen everything else but I won't be adding this to my collection."
2,The rite.,"I thought that this movie would be good, and it was not horrible. I liked that there was a change up for who had to have the exorcism. That was great. But I would not watch it again."
4,"Good, But Not Scary","Although Anthony Hopkins is a phenomenal actor and this movie was very engaging, it was no where near as scary as I had hoped it would be. I would have also liked to have seen more demonic images. This movie is not campy at all, it is a very intellegent and mature film about the true story of a Priest who lost his faith (if he had any to begin with) and suddenly got it back during a confrontation with a high ranking demon in the devil's heirarchy. As I mentioned before, Anthony Hopkins is an incredible actor and this film is just one more to add to my collection of his brillant performances."
4,Very good,"Great movie, hits all the areas desired for supernatural and is a good watch ! Anthony Hopkins is awesome and I even liked that the movie is set in Rome"
3,Hannibal and the Devil,"I love Anthony Hopkins - it's actually required for anyone who lives in Wales. I caught this film by accident. Nothing else was going on and why not?It's okay - but it could have been better. The film is shot and edited well - and the cast gives their professional best. The script and direction ruin it for me. Characters need better development and it's difficult to engage with the main characters. You don't feel for them - you just watch them. This is based on a true story - but it's difficult to make the ""leap of faith"" required."
5,great,Product great quality...thanks love it love it love it love it love it love it love it yesss yes yes
3,Anthony Hopkins saves this film......Barely,"If not for Hopkins this would be a 2 star affair, not many thrills, not much of a story, not much of anything, kind of like this review cause not much to review....Rent it if you must. I will always tell it like I see it. Scott M"
2,Exorcism for Atheists,"The main character is a yuppie bum, whose family parks him in the church to get rid of him... He is an atheist but pretends to believe in the church to get by..The exorcism exercises leave much out and really is just yuppie nonsense.. They had to enlist Anthony Hopkins in the movie otherwise nobody would waste their time to watch it. Anthony must be hard up for money to take a dumb part like this...The better name for this movie would be ""Exorcism for Atheists"".I watched it on Netflix and it was really just a waste of time...Don't bother..."
2,This Doesn't Have The Rite Stuff,"The main problem is we've basically seen it all before and that makes it boring - a religious man questioning his faith and being confronted with exorcism...wow. And please, enough with the 'Emily Rose' school of back-bending - it doesn't have to be a contest which subsequent movie can do the best fake contortions. 'Hollywood' is really trending towards churning out lame movies regardless of 'names' or budget."
5,An excellent novel!,"Austen Andrews is a man of talent and, obviously, hard work. It takes a lot of both to write a novel as intricate and arguably beautiful as this. The world and characters fairly leap off the pages at you, regardless of any knowledge--or lack thereof--of the world and setting of the Ultima series of games on which the book is based. I found myself unable to set the book aside, and irritated by interruptions. This is not only an excellent first novel by a talented author, but a marvelous beginning to a trilogy. I can hardly wait for the next book!"
4,"Excellent book, would recommend to anyone","Believe it or not this has been my first glimps into the world of Ultima. Being a player of fantasy games I had heard of Ultima but only now have I been inspired not only to play the games, but wait with great anticipation for the next book in the Machinations series. The author deserves kudos for this effort, having a great ablity to describe, to bring the reader into a world where such fantasy is possible. The characters are well rounded, and each are a joy, I have found no part of this book boring, or dragging."
5,Black Moon Rising: My thoughts,"At first, I had reservations about reading a werewolf story; the genre has been done to death. But, as a favor to my friend Damien, I began the journey into the lives of his characters. By the second or third chapter I was hooked bad. Withing three days I'd finished the book and discovered I'd done myself a favor by reading DMR.Do yourself a favor and read this fine tale."
5,Best book I've read in a long time....,"Finally, a horror novel that actually scares the [crud] out of you. The character developement was touching and believeable and then when you get to know and like them (the characters), horrible, horrible, violent things happen to them. The dialouge read like a Quinten Tarantino film; very hip, cool, and on target. The story is faced paced and reads like a movie, if you can understand that. (sorry I'm rambling, I just finished reading it and I wanted to share my thoughts somewhere)Bottom line, this is one of the best reads I've had in a long time. This book should be in the ""Terror"" category. I recommend it to any fan of horror. I hope the author is working on a new book, I'll be the first in line to get a copy."
1,Awful,These are paper thin cotton and feel rough. They may soften if washed a few times but the fabric is so thin they may also disintegrate! A big thumbs down from me and I'm usually a CK underwear fan.
2,Don't like it,The seams of this bra iched my skin. I actually thru it in the garbage it bothered me so much.
1,Big Secrets and Misunderstandings overwhelmed this book,"I tried to finish this book, but could only make it halfway through. There was no reason for the big misunderstandings and secrets to keep going on and on the way they did. After awhile I decided that if these people couldn't act in a mature fashion, then I didn't want to read about them anymore. Instead of talking and trying to work things out they would lust after each other and lie, or get mad, or simply not believe the truth so the supposed conflict would continue.I've enjoyed many of the other Bouquets, but unless you like stories based on misunderstandings, this isn't a book I'd recommend."
4,I'd definitely read her again,"Cute, well done, if not terribly suspenseful. I'd read her again though. I like the Jewish deli references everywhere. And at least there was an attempt to fill in loopholes like why the amateur sleuth is sleuthing in the first place, rather than going to the police, even if it did end with the ""and now here's exactly what happened"" expository chapter.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
5,Best Book Available,"This is the most extensive collection of agricultural knowledge over the past 100 years! Although much of the information seems quite dated, it is relevant seeing that many farming procedures today do not differ in techniques of the past. A good reference read as well for all of the ""hobby farmers"" and ""professional farmers"" alike"
1,Recipes my Husband hated,"Although the reicipes in here were low fat and easy to follow, etc...We found that no one in the family would eat the ones I tried. I ended up donating the book to our local library. If you have a picky family this book is not for you."
3,Grape Tigger,"The item itself is very cute. It's scented like grapes, I have one myself. However, the price is unreasonable. I bought mine new from the Disney Store for $3.99."
2,Buyer beware!,"I do not own this recording nor have I ever heard it. I do, however own the CD by the original Quarteto and am taking the time to let less informed buyers know that this is a completely different group. The original Quarteto, comprised by Hermeto Pascoal, Airto Moreira, Heraldo do Monte (a world class guitarist who declined Airto's invitation to join Return to Forever) and bassist Theo de Barros only recorded one album, and while it tempts hungry listeners buy this recording based on the name alone, it definitely ain't the real thing. I've always been leery of groups who choose to name themselves after other groups anyway.Anyone want to join me in starting a band? I already got a name: The Beatles!"
3,polarizing,"You're either going to love it or hate it. The influences are obvious - Cure, Gang of Four, PiL, etc. - so I wouldn't call them ""groundbreaking"", but if you like the above mentioned bands, you'll probably like this.... that is, if you can stand the lead singer's voice. To me, he sounds like a drugged out Tiny Tim mixed with a pubescent Robert Smith, and for some reason I kind of like it on some tracks... but others I can't even listen to. House of Jealous Lovers and some other similar tracks are worth the purchase, though."
2,Ordinary,"This album is definitely all hype. I've been listening to it a lot and I still don't get it. Maybe its just me but none of the tracks stand out, None at all."
4,"hey, not too shabby!","i like this just about as much as i thought i would, which is a tiny bit more than daft punk and half as much as joy division. not exactly what i expected in terms of sound, but i like it...i like that it's subtle in its ass-shaking-ness. i.e., they don't have to go the andrew wk / bobby conn route. so they're making dance-punk? disco-punk? whatever you want to call it, they do it with class. a very solid, emotionally poignant dance record. and yes, ""house of jealous lovers"" is easily as amazing as everyone says it is."
1,Like the Cure? Like very bad Cure,"Oh dear. Another style over substance band has gotten hyped to high heavens by desperate music 'critics' who desperately want to be read, and want their field of journalism to matter. For previous examples, see The Strokes, The White Stripes, The Vines and many other not-as-good-as-the-groups-they're-ripping-off bands. The sound of The Rapture has some superficial resemblance to that of The Cure - or even P.I.L. on one track of this album - but they forgot something that their precursors were masters of: the tunes, the hooks, the melodies. There's nothing here to hold your attention, and quite a lot of pointless shrieking that should drive you away. Avoid. Or, if you already have this, burn."
3,"Good pop album, but not one for the ages",Band? Tight.Singing? Slightly Annoying.Singles? Catchy.Lyrics? Lame.Dance? Fever.Depth? Little.Originality? Some.Pastiche? Plenty.
1,What utter suckage,"What are these people thinking? This stuff sucks! It isn't even worth listening to as a gag. I'd rather be gagged. For some quality music DO NOT TURN TO THIS! All you people that like it, need serious psychological evaluation."
2,Like nails on a chalkboard (almost),"The Rapture is a group with a lot going for them, but they have one major problem - the singer. It's not clear who does what on the album, but the credits make it appear like Luke Jenner is the primary singer. He has a voice that sounds like a cross between quavery Robert Smith and off-key Johnny Rotten. It's minor torture listening to him sing, which is a shame because the band has written some very inventive, original, and rockin' tunes. They've got the funk, the cutting-edge rock, unique production and instrumentation, etc. But the singer can get really bad at times. Just listen to his screeching on ""Infatuation"" and you'll hear what I mean. It's like those auditions on American Idol where somebody is just AWFUL, but people around them have been afraid to tell them how bad they are. I'm sure these guys will be proclaimed as The Next Big Thing, but they have no chance of wider success unless they find another singer."
2,My Ears Hurt,"Pretentious, irritating ""music"" that even a goth would shun. If you want to listen to the sound of nails on a chalkboard....then please be my guest and buy this compost heap."
5,The Rapture,"The raptures cd Echoes bring back such sounds as the cure, depeche mode, and the clash (those are just to name a few). If you like eighties new wave or punk rock you should deffinatly check out the rapture they arent the typical band of today."
4,"""Echoes""","There are many so-called ""dancepunk"" bands lately, but nothing like this one we have here. The Raptures relys heavily on synth and creates trance sound with old school punk. The combination may sound a bit wacky, yet it works.You might have some hard time controlling your body when you listen to the 4th track, ""I need your love""."
4,Genre Busting Great Music,"This is a Great album. The tracks go well together to create an album, instead of a bunch of singles tossed together.I hadn't heard of the band before a friend recommended this album. Now I'm recommending it to you.It's not radio friendly, so you won't see its tracks on a top 40 list. It is very ear friendly though. The music is a very cool blend of dance floor beats and early 90s angst rock.Highly recommended"
1,The Cure? Not even close!,"I just saw these guys perform on tv and thought ""What the..?"" Upon researching the band's identity/buzz/reviews, I constantly came across comparisons to Public Image Ltd, Gang of Four, and THE CURE. While I can't profess to knowing much about PiL or Gang...I know the Cure...and honey, this ain't no cure! To compare this singer to the Great Robert Smith is blasphemy. And their junked up sound reminded me more of the Dead Milkmen on crack than anything else. I gave them one star for fooling New Yorkers into thinking they rock. They most certainly do NOT."
3,It gets worse everytime I listen to it,"Lets start by saying this is not a bad CD by any means, just a disappointing one. I bought this album 3 months ago, not expecting much of it. I was quite surprised when I put it on. It was not an amazing album, but it was very good. Unfortunately, it grows old really quickly. Each time I listen to it, it gets worse and worse. That's why I don't listen to it much. Sure, it's a fun listen, nothing more nothing less. I bought this because of the single 'I Need Your Love' wich is at first listen really annoying, but the second time you're hooked on it, it's so damn catchy. Also the other 3 singles 'House Of Jealous Lovers', 'Sister Saviour' and 'Love Is All' are quite good. Actually every song is quite good, but it just doesn't work for me that well. Buy on own risk.."
2,"Rapture... err, uhh, Rupture?","Fresh off the heals of seeing The Rapture live at the Curiosa festival I was curious enough to want to hear the band produced and clean. There are a few songs that are OK but over all I just can't hang with the blending (and not well either) of so many different genres of music. The Band did show some passion live but there is no excuse for the inclusion of the cow bell as an instrument. Perhaps, Echoes, being the first true release of the band deserves a little sympathy. The band is lyrically weak- apart from the music the songs do not hold up well. The CD was $9.98 so I did not break the bank on these kids... I hope that they got a piece or two of my coin and keep working at it- The band shows some promise."
1,Put these guys out of their misery,"I consider myself well-schooled and very open minded as far as music goes. After reading the rave reviews of this album on this site and others, I decided to give it a try. I'm am so sorry I wasted $15 on this piece of crap. This has got to be the worst album I have ever listened to. The lead singer sounds like someone has him around the neck! The lyrics are beyond annoying. Stay far away from this one!!"
5,Needs more cowbell.,"The Rapture is a fine band, but if you ask me, they could use a bit more cowbell. Trust me, more cowbell is never a bad thing."
2,music=good / voice=bad,"although i havent heard much from this band aside from the little demos amazon offers online, i feel like i have heard enough to formulate an opinion. This band could benefit well from the idea of addition by subtraction. The lead singer may be a friend of the band, but his voice negates any cool music these guys can put together. To be brutally honest he sounds like a tortured cat. Maybe i just dont ""get it""."
3,some New Wave,This sounds very new wavish and even the guy who sounds like pinky from pinky and the Brain.This has the 1980s Dance feel to it and this is an okay album in general.Heres the RatingsLyrics 6/10 Production 4/10 Music 9/10 Style 6/10 Voice 8/10Overall=33/50 wich is 66% enough for 3.5 stars gets 3
2,KILL THE SINGER,"this album is very VERY good other than the singing; this guy sounds like a very VERY lame robert smith wannabe. i thought maybe several listens over a long time would change my mind but alas, no: the songs/sound/feel/vibe of this record are awesome, but i can't help but to LONG to strangle the vocalist several times during every song ..."
5,Ah the sweet smell of music,"The rapture is the best music to come in a long time and boy are they awesome. There style is both electronic and pure rock. Alot of people are comparing them to the cure, but those are just big fat lies and they know it. Those people should listening to the whole album. The album has so much catchy tunes that they will never leave your brain. The CD is well worth the money you will spend. This Cd is Without doubt the best of the year. Go and get it. You will listen to it for the rest of your life."
1,Hong Kong Knock-off DVD,"Other reviewers have already nailed this as a great Japanese samurai movie for many reasons which I need'nt repeat.However, having just made this purchase, I would like to WARN any prospective purchasers of this release version of ""Hunter in the Dark"" that the quality is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! First off, this Panorama(HK) version over-compresses a 2 hr. 17 min. movie into 3.82 GB of a single layer disc resulting in grainy, blurred visuals. Secondly, the editing from original widescreen to this full screen version is horrendously flawed abounding with stretch distortions and badly positioned & overblown pan/scans.Widescreen version DVDs are available, but unfortunately they appear to be bootlegs."
3,Bad Print,"3 stars is kind of a cop-out, maybe I should give it 2 or 1. The fact is I don't know if this is a good movie or not. This is a Chinese edition, I believe, and I don't know but it looks like it was transferred onto dvd from video. In any case it is just dark. Too dark. I doubt that Gosha intended it to be like this-murky. Furthermore, the subtitles were a Chinese person's English subtitles. Not as awful as I have seen elsewhere, but a distraction. This might be a really good movie, it seems like all the other folks are saying so, but as is it was a little hard for me to follow. I have seem better Japanese historical flix. Same director- Goyokin- is a good one, and the transfer is good and subs are by Americans. i thought hunter in the dark was available from a US maker, but I just did a search and couldn't find it. Wait for someone to do it before buying this."
5,Perfect for any Guiding Light Fanatic,"What an awesome way to celebrate the longest running show in broadcast history. Sixty years is really a long time, and this is the perfect way to enjoy all those special moments with the Bauers, Marlers, Chamberlains, Spauldings, Lewis, Reardons, Thorpes. Look through the romances of Reva and the schemes of Roger. Look through the most spectacular love Stories ever told on daytime TV. This is perfect for any die-hard Guiding Light fan.I personally enjoyed this book, because I have only been a fan of the TV series for about 5 years now and since reading this book, I feel like I was actually there when the show started on the radio."
5,IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!,"If you are a Guiding Light fan this book is for you. It will bring up days long gone by, and will help set the ground work for the future.Remember the first episode you ever saw? I sure do, and now I can relive every episode since. The pictures help you relieve the moments from the radio days to the present. The complete cast list will help you remember the actor that played your favorite character.This book is well worth the money, get it and enjoy. And as always Be Guided By Light."
2,Dun think its 925 sterling silver.,My ears are really sensitive and can only wear gold and silver earrings.Had infection after wearing these. So I dun think they were made 100% 925 stealing silver.
1,yuck,Do not waste your money. I depend heavily on reviews when making purchases from Amazon.com therefore I had to take the time and let shoppers know that these earrings are not worth any amount of money. After wearing them for two weeks the posts were black. Yuck! So they went right in the trash.
3,Nothing Special,"I thought these would look like real diamonds considering the diamonique name. However, when compared to my older $5 studs, I didn't see much of a difference. If you really want nice diamond earrings, I suggest you go real."
1,Didnt work out for me,"They gave me a rash, I never has this issue so I am not sure what material they are made of. I will be returning them."
1,Cheap stuff,The stud broke off one of the earrings. It was bent and I tried to straighten it. Bad idea huh?
2,"Educational, not interesting!","Although the book teaches you many educational facts about Communism, I felt that it was not worth my time. Every time I sat down to read it, I found myself drifting asleep. It may be good for one thing, but definitely not worth the time of reading."
2,Animal Farm,I read this as a school asignment and I did not enjoy it. I did not really understand the meaning of the book. I guess it aplied to the world a while ago but I can't aply it to life today. It was rather confusing for me.
1,I thought that the book Animal Farm by George Orwell was bad,The book Animal Farm by George Orwell was very childish and there was not a good plot to it at all. I would definately recomend that you do not read this book.
1,anti-communist novel by former british secret service agent,Animal Farm is George Orwells anecdote-like tale about what happened in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Many people think that this book deals with the human condition. Quite the contrary: this book builds lies and more distorts the potetial that humanity(in paticular the working class) can achieve. Orwell's vision is cynical and dismisses the millions of workers who struggle and fought to end not only Tsarism but Nazism.
4,"Excellent book, imaginative plot",The book was excellent. It showed how Orwell used his imagination in writing this children and adult book.
4,"good, but probably could be better","The author equates Old Major with Marx, Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky. That's interesting, but isn't there more to say about Animal Farm?"
2,A give away,"Although this book helped me comprhend the symbolism of Animal Farm, i often found that it gave away future parts of the book. For example, i would read the comentary of chapter three, and it would give away a critical event that comes on much later in the book. In addition, i did not think that it interpereted all the symbolism that Orwell used. My advise if you are going to read Animal Farm, is to try a different source of notes."
2,So-So,"A rather dull story, to tell the truth. I guess you get what you pay for (free, in this case). As is the case with Gutenberg titles, its not always formatted so well."
5,A very uninteresting and dull book,"This is a very uninteresting and dull book, full of trivia and tiny things. I needed great patience to finish reading this book."
5,bassman,THIS IS A TOP OF THE LINE PREAMP!! REALLY GREAT WITH PASSIVE FENDER BASSES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT MG
3,"nice book, most projects are above my head.","I had seen plans of a medieval chair from this book. I loved the chair and found the directions understandable. So I ordered the book. I found several great projects for me to do as an amature woodworker. All the projects are great and accurate to the region, however, I'm not quite up to buiding the bedrooms sets and other ""projects of epic size"" that take up about half the book."
3,Okay.... But Need A Little More effort....,"I got this single and I think there needs to be a little more effort the next time this kind of song is hung. I think he just sings as if his voice is about to crack sometimes through the song. Don't get me wrong, I like this song. But over time you get bored of this song as it is played over and over again. I tried it. it doesn't at least I can say. But I give him credit for the effort put into this song. Good work Justin..."
4,Good but not great.,"If you haven't read Touching the Void...read it first as Joe makes several references to it. I read Touching The Void...and couldn't put it down - outstanding book, and a must read for any climber!I bought this one hoping for the same. The book was good by all standards but Joe seemed to lose focus on what he was writing about in several places. I think it would have been better if this were divided into two books: one about the flying and one about climbing.If you're in doubt, buy it...its worth the cover price just for the Eiger history and Joes attempt on it; and Joe is such a talented writer that he can make some mistakes and still create a great book."
2,Stop Whining,"For a guy with the true grit to drag himself out of a crevasse and down a South American mountain in ""Touching the Void"", he sure does a lot of whining at the begining of this book. His attempts at existentialism really bogs the book down. Once he gets down to doing what he is good at, writing about climbing, his description of his attempt on the Eiger is gripping stuff."
2,They tried,"I'm sorry Orlando Bloom, but your accent was terrible. Keep at it, you'll get it right.Kirsten Dunst was doing the heavy lifting in this movie; charming as usual, she stole the show. There were a lot of good elements, like the family scenes, the town, and especially the soundtrack, but the plot was a bit dispassionate. The main character, Drew, goes from wonderkid to huge failure in a very short span of time, then tries to kill himself. (This all happens within the first 10-20 minutes or so), but personally I felt nothing for him. I think the problem was that Drew was drifting aimlessly, so the plot did, too. But unfortunately, he wasn't an interesting enough character make this strategy work."
5,Best Movie on The Planet,"Elizabethtown is the must-see movie of the year. Tickets have sold out, the line was too long! Who cares about the the popcorn? Now it's on DVD and VHS! Buy it now, while it's still in stock. Kirsten Dunst is as fresh as ever, her acting skills gaining! This movie is her one true sucess! Have you seeen the Virgin Sucides, Spiderman, Interview with the Vampire? Well, here's the same stunnign actress with some of her best work yet. Then Orlando Bloom, those Bloom boy fans out there will scream when they see the dark skinned, curly brown haired hunk in this movie! Troy, Lord of the Rings, anything ring a bell? well, here's a big ring on Elizabethtown! A love story, a comedy, a true classic! I'm just one of the fans trying to get the word out! Get it now, and Amazon is the perfect place to get it!"
5,Elizabethtown,"If you're a chick you'll love it. If you're a guy and ever met a really special woman you'll love it, and If you love good older music you'll watch it over and over again."
3,"Good, but not great.","I'm a sap, I love that mushy falling in love type movie. While this movie is one of those, it just failed to take me on that whimsical jourey of falling in love. The movie is held together by some hilarious one liners and comical scenes. And what I would have considered to be the climax (Drew's breaking down and finally crying over his father on the road trip) wasn't all that great. What actually got me teary eyed was a combonation of great music and personal experience in that scene. The soundtrack is fantastic. I don't even know how long I listened to Tom Petty's Learning To Fly after seeing that movie (while not on the soundtrack, it was on the jukebox on the Elizabethtown website). The movie's soundtrack, filled with music that just fits that Midwest region feel (being from a Midwest state) and the quirky one-liners/comical scenes do make this a good movie for the regular sap, but not a great one."
2,Watchable,"When I saw the preview for this movie, I was interested in it. I'm originally from Louisville, Ky and had worked in the Elizabethtown area at one time (locals call it E-Town). I was really looking forward to seeing the movie. I thought it was watchable. The two lead actors Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunsdt both had very good performances in it. I thought that the movie meandered all over the place, and never had a theme to it (or a plot). I expected more out of Mr Crowe."
5,elizabethtown dvd,I am very happy with my DVD purchase of ElizabethTown.... I have searched and searched for it... and on top of that... I bought the DVD for a great price !
3,This movie grows on you,"The more I see this movie the more I like it. Not your typical romantic comedy. It has some dark humor but at the same time is sweet and fun.It make take time to get to like this movie and some of the character's in it, but give it a change and it/they will grow on you."
3,Average,"I have to agree with most of the reviewers about this film. It'a a movie that tries too hard. Orlando does a decent job for what is presented, but Kirsten (and I'm not sure it's her fault) is an unbelievable character from jump street. There's bubbly and then there's CLAIRE. Nothing about this woman seemed real. Even at the end: was there a BEN? I mean I was begining to think we were dealng with mentally-chanellenged woman. And we know NOTHING about her. We know everything there is about Drew's character and next to nothing on this woman. Therefore, I wasn't exactly rooting for the romance. Sure there are cute moments--but overall-it's a movie that tries to hard with very little."
5,One of my favorites... Deep in every respect.,"Honestly: This is one of m favorite movies to watch over and over again. It's funny and captures a lot of deep heart stuff. The music rocks. The chemistry between Bloom and Dunst is fantastic. Both are brilliant. This is the best romantic drama comedy life movie I have seen in a while. I loved it! I recommend it to everyone. It just movies me (his road trip home with deep felt music, story and emotion kills me every time.) The end is awesome. It tackles loss of life, restoration, romance, courage with life pursuit, nostalgia and more. All in one movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!"
5,Awesome Movie. Elizabetown,Enjoyed it from the beginning to end. Everything about this movie hit home for me and it seemed so real even though it was just a movie.
2,Aimless at times.,"Though I really like the actors that were in this film, I am quite surprised that the Producers and Directors didn't take better control of it. Some critical points were terribly underdone and others way overdone. It's like there was nobody in charge on the set that had any sort of barometer. Sorry guys. Film was disjointed and sorry again, but lovely Mr. Bloom underwhelmed me this time. Either his heart was not in this film or he was simply not directed at all well. Would really like to see him dig much deeper inside himself. Whatever the case, it was a great idea for a film, but execution of it just flopped."
1,Avoid!,"Cliche-ridden writing and plot makes this immensely painful to watch. Very predictable. I've seen reviews questioning the acting of Dunst and Bloom but no one could save this one. Lester Bangs, one of Cameron Crowe's supposed heroes, would turn over in his grave at this one. The last scene of Dunst and Bloom finding each other in a fair and rushing to meet each other in an embrace makes this movie so bad, it's right up there with Showgirls."
4,"Very good film, disappointed DVD","With a wonderful film (from Carmeron Crowe with Orlando Bloom & Kirsten Dunst) we've got... NOTHING in special features. No cut scenes (and there's a LOT of cut scenes), no interviews, no picture gallery, no making of... Only three videos... No documentary of Cameron Crowe and how did he live this film. Really... nothing in bonus.BUT !!! This film is still absolutely wonderful, as I loved it in cinema. So, from the moment I've got the film in DVD, the bonus don't matter at all...... but still... Well I'm in condition for waiting an extended version ! (still hoping...)"
4,paula deen,"bought this movie just to see how Paula Deen did in her acting debut. although she played only a bit part, she did very well. the movie itself was definetly worth viewing."
5,Love!,"I love this movie. I'm not a fan of a lot of chick flicks, but this one is just so good! I think it's a little quirky which is why I love it!"
3,not bad,"Dunst is hot and Orlando Bloom is a good actor in this movie!The movie can be funny at times but it can also, as they say ""tug at your heartstrings"" and yeah like that. Susan Sarandon is in this also but you know why I like watching her...mmmmm! She is so hottie! This movie has a soundtrack you might like as well! At least there was no NIN on it!"
3,"Cute, relaxed movie","Greetings,I think this is a cute, relaxed movie. It's not all up in your face, edge of your seat material, it's a good movie.I thought Clare was cute, and Drew's moodeness, and lathargic ways, was reflecting a depressed, lost man, who has no passion for life. He is suicidal, and with the death of his father, his only goal was to make sure his fathers wishes were met. I think it would have helped if they had shown some of his childhood relationship with his father, or a regretful moment with his father he wished he could change, that Clare could have helped him overcome, and a bit less of his great failure. It starts out good and slows down a little in parts. Both Bloom and Dunst are talented in their profession. This movie at the end it gives you a good feeling."
2,Boring and slow,"I like Orlando Bloom. I like Kirsten Dunst also. This movie was just boring I'm sorry. I disagree with some of the negative reviews blaming the actors. I think it was more the subject matter and the story that just didnt give them anything to do. It was just mind numbingly dull. And there were multiple parts I was sitting there thinking see this could have been completely cut out and nothing would have been lost because nothing happened.The editing was terrible, way too many things going on and not enough actually happening."
3,"Average, had promise but fell flat","Not a bad movie--Orlando Bloom was actually pretty decent, but Kristen Durnst seemed pretty unidimensional & her character didn't come off as very likeable. What I want to know is how long before they buried Drew's father? If it is the normal 3 days, then they sure did a heckuva lot in 3 days--Kristen puts together an entire album with maps & homemade CD's in how long? And the mother learns to tap dance, be a comedian, etc. in 3 days? Her whole funeral speech just seemed so cheesy Hollywood--could have been so much better..."
1,I only lasted 20 minutes before my head exploded!,"I waited two years to give this film a chance and boy do I regret it. This movie killed me. I'm dying right now. Don't even look at the DVD box, this movie's lameness is that lethal. We should start flogging criminals again and Cameron Crowe should be the first to be lashed for creating such a waste of resources. Oh, my god! Don't, even get me started on Orlando Blooms' accent. Arrggghhh!"
4,"Weird, awkward, quirky, but surprisingly nice...","I went into watching this movie with mixed feelings after reading the reviews, but I was bored and couldn't sleep so I watched it. It was strange at times, a little unusual, and maybe a tad unbelievable but you know what, it worked. With its sometimes goofy, slightly comedic, a little disturbing and even heart warming moments, the movie just worked. I ""walked"" away from this movie feeling like I need to go on a road trip and take the ""long way"" way home. It reminded me that sometimes I can get so focused on the details of life and miss out on the big picture and the small enjoyments or the people who I enjoy those moments with. So over all it wasn't the conventional movie, but it was pleasantly nice."
5,great romantic comedy,"If you're going to have the male lead in just about every scene, Orlando Bloom is very easy on the eyes. Enjoyed his comedy as well. Kirsten Dunst plays the oddball amazing women perfectly. Crazy, but loveable. The roadtrip was very well done and of course Cameron Crowe's soundtrack fantastic as always. As with most of his movies, I danced out of the theater."
4,A NICE LOVE STORY,"A nice love tale about love in hometowns and getting back up from massive failures. The lovers match nicely in this tale, too. MY GRADE: B to B plus."
4,A very nice love story,"And the acting on this one is not at all bad either...It is sort of a ""low impact"" love storywhere friendship flowers into something more.I liked it... it might even become a classic?The family and the failure of his shoe openthe hero to a new way of seeing his life.What he thought was the end, becomes theirbeginning."
2,So-so,"Should've listen to my friends about this one but since we are Garden State and N. Dynamite fans thought I would have to see this one as well. Well, were they right! Yes, the music selection is good (I own the volume 2 which I recommend since you do not hear many of those songs in the actual movie). However the funny parts are far and few. Frankly it is boring and the love story is cliche and overly sugar coated. However, Dunst did a fantastic job, she is the only thing that makes this movie. If you are an Orlando fan, skip this, since he is horrible in this pick. Overall I would save it for a rainy day... maybe."
1,Awful,"this movie is so poorly done...there is no plot....the acting sucks...the dialogue is poorly written...even the music is so-so...the movie is about 45mins longer than the genre tends to be....overall, its 2hrs 15min longer than it needs to be...SAVE your money"
2,One of the larger disappointments of its year of release...,"Way too long. Boring. Wasting a fine cast and budget. I've been to Elizabethtown, Kentucky (Abe Lincoln was born not far from there) and this film is less interesting than the town itself."
3,If only they gave the starring role to someone else,"Im a huge Cameron Crowe fan.""Elizabethtown"" in some ways reminds me of ""Vanilla Sky"" which I thoroughly enjoyed.I dont want to disrespect Orlando Bloom but he was miscast as the lead in this film.His character was responsible for losing his company almost a billion dollars but he didnt carry himself as someone who had to suffer this burden.His portrayal for the most part was soulless unlike Ms. Dunsts' which was a shame because this was a very well written film."
1,"Don't waste your time, even my wife hated it!","This movie had a very slow pace that served no purpose. I felt compelled to fastforward throughout the entire movie and at the end, I wish I had; I would not have missed a thing. What a waste of film!"
4,Elizabethtown,Not a bad flick. Good purchase. I first watched this out camping in my trailer in the mountains. Passed the time by in a good manner!
3,I give it 3 Stars,"I didn't think anything great about this movie. It is a chick flick, that is for sure! It has some funny parts, and I think the love story was sweet."
3,"Ok film, confusing HORRIBLE DVD PACKAGE","I bought the DVD to see Orlando.I found the movie to be very confusing.Going off in different directions.Some great songs in the soundtrack. Film CAN NOT be all bad when you have U2 in the soundtrack.I did not care for scenes with Orlando & Kirsten's characters playing around when his characters deceased father in the urn. Disrespectful.Kirsten's character? As a diabetic, I CAN NOT TAKE THAT MUCH SUGAR.OK, the DVD package.I have 2 pet peeves with DVD packages & this films package had them both:1. The flip down hatches to open the plastic package.2. NO CHAPTER SHEET.Paramount apparently did not want to care about the package since the film did not do that well in theaters.Poor way to treat any film let alone the people who purchase this package."
2,Didn't quite work for me!,"Director Cameron Crowe, who successfuly did other films in this formula(Almost Famous, Jerry McGuire) doesn't gel the same magic in this one. This film had potential. The cast was top knotch and entertaining. But, while I thought the musical soundtrack blended exceptionally well with the film, overall, I was left wondering, ""why should I care about it?"" Possibly the two hour run time may have worked against it. Didn't quite work for me!"
4,"Fair plotline, but good actors","A somewhat of a disappointment, but Elizabethtown was still pretty good. Orlando Bloom's performance was fair (I felt very let down) but Kirsten Dunst really shined. The plot was alright too, though somewhat confusing and the ending did somewhat leave me hanging. I wouldn't buy the DVD, but I would suggest renting it from Blockbuster."
2,elizabethtown,"Oh my God, this movie shocked me. Truly terrible. Awkard, long, boring, stupid and there are way too many songs crammed into this. Everyone loves a good, warm 70's number every once in a while in nice dramatic scenes, but Cameron Crowe crams in about 4 different songs per minute in this overlong, badly, badly acted pointless bore. I am a fan of some of his work and have enjoyed the actors in other movies, but I am warning you. Unless you are a big Orlando Dunst fan, back away from this idea of seeing it."
5,Like Coming Home,"Elizabethtown is a beautiful town in Kentucky, and I will admit it rented the DVD simply for that reason. I visited there once, over 25 years ago, and fell in love.Put simply, the movie will touch the heart of people who enjoy stories about family. It isn't a silly comedy, nor is it a tear jerker,although I did get a lump in my throat once or twice, and I laughed out loud now and then.Elizabethtown is a movie that shows the value of family, and the soundtrack is simply awesome! I sat, enthralled, for over two hours, and when it was over, I wanted to go out and buy copies for everyone I knew.I am a simple person, with simple tastes, and Elizabethtown is my kind of movie. I am buying it so I can watch it again and again."
4,A great film that makes you love life,"A great film that makes you love life and at the end make you mile. The begging of the movie was a little slow but it picks up and it gets really good. The acting is great from Orlando Bloom, Kirsten Dunst, Susan Sarandon. Bloom and Dunst have great chemistry one of the best chemistry in recent film history. Dunst is great in this film and shines from start to finish. I loved the story it makes you aprechiet life. I loved this movie just loved it."
1,"Bomb, zinger, wow. can't believe it's so bad with that cast.","Histrionic performances and horrible soundtrack, 20 minutes into this bomb I was laughing. And this is supposed to be a thriller?Embarrassing, overwrought performance from Rod Steiger, camp goofiness from Alan Rickman, woodenness from Harvey Keitel and seemingly satiric Boy Scoutishness from Kevin Kline...If you're in the mood for a laugh, turn down the sound and do your own soundtrack to this incredibly lame flick."
1,Worst film i have EVER seen in my whole life,"January Man is a film is a must see if you need to to update your film evaluation measurement scale. It is the absolute worst. You can then use it as a benchmark to reconsider other bad movies you may have seen.As I assume many others, I was attracted to the purchase based on the superstar cast. If one were to read the fine print, however, you could get a hint that something is wrong when you see that the film lasts 1 1/2 hours only. Unfortunately I did not read the fine print.This film is so absurd and bad that you truely need to wonder about the people who have posted the other reviews. Probably friends and family of the filmamaker."
4,underrated and underappreciated,"This movie got savaged (and continues to be) when it first came out. I think that with all the talent involved, people were expecting something a lot more... mainstream. This is one of those oddball detective/crime thrillers a la The Long Goodbye or Trixie that just doesn't fit in anywhere. It blends genres together and this bugged a lot of people who just wanted a by-the-numbers story.Everyone in the cast is fantastic but the real standout, for me, is Alan Rickman cast totally against type as the slightly effeminate artiste (and computer genius), Ed. Rickman gets most of the best lines and steals every scene he's in. He and Kline play well off each other and it's a shame this film tanked because I'd have loved to see more adventures with these two.The DVD is a real disappointment. No extras. Nothing! Just dumped unceremoniously on DVD. Oh well. At least it's letterboxed!"
1,Disappointied,"I could not use the video because it does not play in my VCR. It is for use in European VCRs. I had no idea there was a difference. When I ordered the video, I did not scroll down to the bottom of the page where this info was given. In my opinion, this info should be in the description of the product."
1,Should have been better,January Man was big disappointment. It could have been much better with a better script and some tightening of the plot. I agree with the other reviewers who gave it a one-star rating and don't feel it is necessary to repeat their comments.
1,Intended First of a Series? I watched in complete disbelief.,"In watching the movie, I began to wonder if it was supposed to be the first of a series. I kept thinking that it was trying to be an updated version of ""The Thin Man"" series and so this movie was trying to establish the characters. With that reasoning, it makes sense the there a number of sub-plots that remain undeveloped and that the characters have strange relationships that go unexplained.However what I mostly wondered about was what they were thinking when they made this movie. This movie has done something that is truly unique. It has found ways to be bad that I have never seen in any other movie. The script is preposterous. The characters are artificial and their relationships make no sense. it is a comedy that is not funny. It is a mystery that is no suspenseful. It is thriller that is not exciting. Like others, I watched this movie in complete disbelief."
1,Even a great cast can't help a bomb,"Wow, what a stinker! Kevin Kline, Harvey Keitel and Alan Rickman can't save this movie. Poorly written, poorly directed, and terribly acted. One would expect Rod Steiger to go over the top, but Danny Aiello is just as bad. Stay away from this. I paid about $2 for the DVD and felt I overpaid. Hard to believe I wasted perfectly good electricity to witness this drivel. Did I mention the movie was lousy?"
1,A major disappointment,"It's obvious that Kevin Kline was trying to capitalize on his success in ""A Fish Called Wanda"" when he signed on to play the lead in ""The January Man.""Sadly, the success isn't repeated.Kline, inspired as the crazy hit-man in ""Fish,"" is singularly uninspired as the offbeat cop in ""January."" This is a cast with tons of promise, but with little plot and less script to aid them. Alan Rickman's character is potentially the most interesting, but even he lacks dimension.After flopping in the departments of comedy and romance, the only possible salvation for ""The January Man"" is its potential as a thriller. Kline does have just enough charisma to possible keep you watching all 97 dreary minutes. But beware: the ending is a complete disappointment and left me angry -- both at Kline and Co. for producing this mind-numbing junk, and at myself for wasting both time and money on such a bad movie."
3,January Man,"It was a good thriller, didn't care for K.Klein so well, but I was watching it for Alan Rickman's performance. As quirky as ever."
2,Buyer beware,"These are decent exercises that seem to raise my metabolism, but for $60 and 6 discs that contain 6 workouts each, I was expecting to get 36 individual/unique workouts. Instead you get 12 unique workouts and 24 repeats. That's entirely too much money for what you actually receive. The extra content was really just a few thin pamphlets that provided a brief overview of this program and some basic eating and supplementation tips, but nothing you can't find for free on his site and others. I just feel that the company was not being completely honest about what you actually receive for $60. This set should be priced at no more than $20 and really only needs to include the first and last discs, which would have the added bonus of letting them put it in much better packaging."
3,Not sure yet,"I don't usually write reviews but I thought I would because this is a big issue for me.I'm a vegan and this diet is strictly about eating MEAT. I am not impressed that they don't offer a vegetarian/vegan version.And I'm not sure I appreciate the One sided information about the history of men and meat. He only mentions research pro meat but fails to inform you that there is a whole other side that believe over consumption of meat is unhealthy. Research done by Dr. Campbell who has been doing such research for 20+ years now.I'm going to do the program, i'm just saying it would have been nice to have a Vegan option.I'll let you know if a week if my stubborn fat has started to go away."
1,Still waiting...,I ordered Dr. Sears e-book a ton of years ago and have followed the exercise recommendations...they are great. I was excited to see this whole system launched and ordered it from the pace express website not realizing it was offered through Amazon. I am still waiting for them to ship it. My first email inquiry went un-answered and my second email got a response from customer service saying they were still waiting for product from the manufacturer but would mark my inquiry and order urgent. Who cares!? If you don't have product something should go up on the site saying there has been a delay. Instead it still says your order will be processed in two or three business days and you should get it in 10 business days. What a crock! This might be a great product but how would I know?
1,Look elsewhere,"While the seller shipped this very quickly, the construction of the set itself is not very good. I am not an overweight person, but leaning back in the chairs even a little bit is a precarious exercise at best. One chair has already broken into two pieces when the back separated from the seat portion completely when I sat in it. The screws should screw into the seat portion from the back of the chair, but instead go in from the inside of the back legs, which is not very stable. I found this out the hard way as my rear end met with the floor when I should have been sitting in a chair. If I had the option to give zero stars I would, since I will be returning this item as soon as I can."
1,some assembly required ?????,"this is not a sturdy set at all - the table is NOT 33"" high as described but is 29"" - the set does NOT come with pre-drilled holes in the wooden sections (also noted other reviews) - and the wood is in fact very hard - so it is impossible to put together unless you have the strength of a man's hands and/or an electric drill - we've all learned in Civics about the Implied Warranty - in other words - put together furniture, should be able to be put together by most - so SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED ??????"
2,Appalled at the price for this short read!,"I read a LOT of books by this author and, while a little shocked by the $8.09 price tag, purchased what I thought would be a reasonably lengthy novel. Imagine my fury when I found the length to be 2149 locations (less than 150 pages) !No book that short is worth that much money, especially when you can usually buy an excellent used paperback version on Amazon for much less.Please price these ebooks fairly! Also, it would be great if Amazon Kindle books included the number of locations or pages in each ebook's description, so customers won't be surprised or feel cheated."
2,Menage a Magick,It was the WORST work that i have read by Lora Leigh. It was also one of the worst books that i have ever read. I'm ashamed that i bought it. I LOVE most of Lora Leigh's books but this book was horrible.
2,Boring...,"I normally love books written by Lora, especially if they involve menage, but for some reason this book did not work for me. I think a lot of time was wasted in detailing the setting of the story and too little time was given to the characters. If you are looking for a good series, try the August brothers or the Bound Hearts series instead...."
2,Spoiled Consort Gets Two Men,"Brianna is to be the consort of twins. She doesn't want to know them, be around them or be with them. In her mind, they are not good people and she wants nothing to do with them.It seems that she is spoiled, selfish and only thinks of herself. The twin brothers that are betrothed to her seem to only want to care for her and pleasure her beyond belief. But, it isn't until they are joined inside her that she begins to care for them... The sex in the book is good, but the story leaves something lacking. I would suggest going with one of Lora Leigh's other series."
4,"Gorgeous Pictures, Not-So-Great Writing Quality","Fun books for their illustrations and not their writing quality, the Billy and Blaze series were always at the top of my list growing up. They smack of great wild west adventures and the fun that can be had on horseback.Although poorly written, the Billy and Blaze series was fascinating to me as a girl and fed my imagination. Any young horse lovers will eat up the vivid black and white drawings that tell the quaint stories much more eloquently than the rather dry words.To read more of my children's book reviews, visit larsenreviews.org."
2,"If you love the Beatles, don't buy this album","This is one of the cheesiest albums I've ever heard. I heard the cut ""And I Love Her"" on my classical radio station and loved it, so I ordered the CD. That turns out to be the only good cut. The other arrangements are so cheesy, I'm actually thinking about throwing the CD away!"
4,This book was excellent because it makes you think.,"This is a book that I would recommend to my friends, but not many people are into Nancy Drew anymore. This book made me very anxious. I could not put it down. I squeezed in a page every minute I had. I had the greatest urge to turn to the back of the book to see what happened."
2,Nancy Drew #34,"Don't get me wrong I am a HUGE fan of the Nancy Drew series. I have read a little more than half the series. But this one is probably one of the worst. It's just my opinion. I found it hard to make it through the first chapter, but I finished the book. It was just too confusing there was so many mysteries, characters, and events that you just got bored and confused. I quickly solved the mystery though. I wouldn't want to read this if I was you."
4,A much needed book but the movies of the forties are awful,"No problem here in recommending this book as a ""must have"" for any Laurel and Hardy fan. The author doesn't claim the Boys' films of the forties are ignored gems, contrary to what has been implied in various reviews of this book. He confirms that these films are awful, in varying degrees of awful (even the most ardent Laurel and Hardy fan agonizes when watching the horrible Atoll K). What the author does do-that hasn't been done to date-is shed more light (much more) on what transpired during this period of time in the Boys' professional lives. As I stated previously this is must reading for any Laurel and Hardy fan."
1,No reason to buy this!!,Halo 2 is a very easy game and this guide will not tell you ANYTHING you won't find in about 3 minutes.
2,no so much...,"I really dont use guides that often. My friend purchased this guide for me and it is really awful. Bad layout and small fonts fill this cheating device. POint less screen shots show awesome graphic but, you could play them game and see awesome graphics. if you buy this cheat guide you cheat your self. the idea is not to finish as fast as you can its to have and tons of fun. I used the wrong gun a enemy several times and each time i was dis membered. But as my limbs where ripped from my body on my computer animated me the real me was laughing my head. Dont get this. If you really want to cheat use the web you get it cheaper and theres not shipping involved"
3,Helped Me... Just not alot,"This guide was okay. Plain and simple. If you are stuck and don't know where to go don't use this book. One of the levels of Halo 2 the directions were so confusing I got lost for three hours, not knowing where to go (I know that your thinking ""How can you get lost in a video game?""). However I would recommand this to you if you are one of those gamers with a good sense of direction. This would serve to you as a constant reminder of what you are going to do, not where. The multiplayer section is pretty cool but I don't really like the maps at the beginning of the level. They are incredibly confusing. My advice: Pick the guide up if you can't find a guide online. This guide although confusing has some helpful tips."
3,Good for starter box but.... Broke after one month of use,"This product is good for use with starter boxI do not know that was luck, or it is poor qualityBroke after one month of useSpecifically The pins Broke (one of them)Starter box linkT-Start Revo Nitro Starter Box"
3,"Not her best, but still well worth reading.","Iris Murdoch's books aren't for everyone: they are written for sensitive, intellectual, and introspective readers. The Black Prince is a very intelligent, well-crafted book. However, I think the 2 Forewords would have been better left out, as they refer to characters and events we know nothing of yet. Moreover, I found it regrettable that the novel only seems to really begin at about half-point. The first half tends to lack intensity and direction, but then the story finally takes a decisive - if no longer expected - turn for the more interesting. The second half is vintage Iris Murdoch, with several strong scenes. There's an abrupt surprise in store at the end, but the other surprises lurking in the Postscipts may be perceived as a bit unpleasant and excessive. Not Murdoch's best (I prefer The Sacred & Profane Love Machine), but still well worth reading."
4,A DISTURBING STUDY OF MANKIND IN ALL ITS CUNNING,"""The Black Prince"" is a repelling page-turner. I often found myself reaching to pick it up, then reaching past it for almost anything else. It is a mordant study of the psychological tennis match that constitutes so much of human interaction. It is a novel with not one likeable character, and yet one can somehow relate to all of them. I found it disturbing throughout, but was quite taken with it."
3,the black prince,self absorption and its consequences was a major theme in my perception of the characters with the strong exception of one character Julian. Lunacy Idiocy and general carryings-on covered hidden depths of emotional failure.
5,One of the greatest and most entertaining novels ever.,"I've read about half of Iris Murdoch's books, and I believe this book represents the pinnacle of her achievement. The book is deeply satisfying from beginning to end. The plot, which revolves around an older man's obsession with a young girl, echoes a classic theme which goes back as far as Plato's Symposium. As the author interweaves her meditations on art, beauty, Hamlet, and book-a-year novelists into this standard plot, the book achieves a level of self-consciousness found in the greatest literature. And like her earlier works, it is fun to read. Having the main characters comment on the story at the end is a wonderful device, both profound and entertaining. This is one of my two or three favorite novels. Over the years I've loaned my hardcover edition out to friends so often, it now looks like a well worn library book."
4,A Good Read,"Regarding a previous review: Perhaps some of the characters are a bit prolix but this is not necessarily a defeat is it? And thank God Murdoch was no Dostoesvsky, should she have been? I think one was quite enough. Bradley Pearson is a pleasant, at least pleasantly readable, incarnation of some of Murdoch's philosophy without being overbearing or esoteric. One need not always read about self-castigation and repentence to know that suffering has variegated coats and one need not do away with one's landlady to find guilt, perhaps it accrues. Bradley Pearson is a certain type of protagonist. Perhaps some will relate and others won't, its not necessary anyway. The dialogue and inner-dialogue is enough to pique and provoke. The ""Black Prince"" is a good read and should be taken as such, I recommend it highly."
3,Hmmmm???,"Ok so I got these lights for the the under dash of my integra.. When I read this was 10 in. I imagined the bulb was 10 inches long but unfortunately I was wrong.... The whole thing is 10"" the actual bulb is around 6 inches... I could've gotten actual 10"" in auto zone for the same price... These are still kinda good though and my car does still look better with them so that's why I did 3 stars... Not too good not too bad..."
4,"Cute Book for the Very Young - a review of ""Happy B-day, Biscuit!""","I am so used to the ""I Can Read"" Biscuit stories that I was surprised by this one which features more words and longer sentences. In fact, it wasn't until I checked and rechecked the cover that I realized it was a read-aloud book (lol).That said, it could be used for a practice reader for advanced kindergarteners or first graders. Three pages of text follow so you can judge for yourself:""Now it's time for birthday treats,"" said thelittle girl. ""Make a wish, Biscuit.""Woof!""Funny puppy! You want to open your birthday presents!""Four Stars. Nice Read-aloud that should appeal to older babies and toddlers. I wouldn't purchase it for kindergarteners or older children unless I was going to use it as a practice reader. In general, the ""Booklist"" review does a very good job in summarizing the book."
3,Didn't Read the Description,"My daughter has a Biscuit Easter book. It was one of her first books...and is really worn out b/c she's flipped the pages so many times. I was very excited to find this book as we approached her first birthday. I was expecting to get a board book, possibly with some ""touch and feel"" like the Easter book. Instead I received a hard cover book with standard weight pages. I returned it. The book would have been demolished in less than a week.This is not so much a negative review regarding the book, more of a word of caution."
3,A Little Too Short...,"Biscuit is a perfectly adorable puppy and this is him and his little owner girl celebrating his birthday with a pack of his friends from his other adventures. Unfortunately the story seems a bit short, since they included some ""activity"" pages in the back instead of making a larger book. Such once-offs as activity pages should be kept to disposable mediums as coloring books and not included in a keepsake item like this. Once the kids take the markers and crayons to it to do the ""activities"" the rest of the book is only asking to get colored on as well, and it made the book shorter as well.My daughter likes the title but it seems too short in comparision with others, and the price. There's just not enough to it. A Biscuit birthday should be a bit more exciting than this."
1,One of the most ridiculous books I've ever read,"The book describes alleged intelligence connections of the author. Unfortunately, the author is blinded by hate, of both Israel and the ""Zionist satan"". As well, the author subscribes to a number of conspiracy theories that evoke the golden age of blood libels. Finally, the writing style is simply awful: the book may be a translation from another language. For example, consider the following passage:""I thought to myself how awful and perverted the Zionists are; how disgraced their society and how corrupt their souls"". Ugh."
3,Very Insightful!,This book was very well written. Very imaginative and keeps you wanting more. I could almost feel as though I was traveling with Joseph and Mary.... You could feel the struggles they were going through.....
5,HIGHLY Recommended!,"This book is an excellent way to get to know the real Beethoven, rather than a biographer's possibly biased opinion about him, such as Solomon. The more one looks into Beethoven's life, the more interesting it becomes. He was such a controversial, often misunderstood composer. We often hear of his moodiness, temper, and idiosyncrasies yet this collection of writings and personal remembrances will help you to better understand why he was perceived that way. You sense the utter despondency he experienced as his one gift to the world (his music) became such a challenge for him as his hearing decreased. Hard to pick a favorite remembrance - Probably the friendship that developed between a French speaking messanger and German speaking Beethoven! - Jonna Lambrosa Statt"
5,awesome book,"If you love Beethoven you have to have this book. It gives you a deeper insight into the Master's mind and music, a clearer picture of the whole man."
3,The foam inside too thick,I was looking for a small pouch to put very minimum stuff. The size is perfect but the foam inside is thick that made this very bulky when I put a couple of credit cards and 2-3 quarters. Either the foam is thiner or no foam at all would have worked for me better. I kept it anyways but not using this at all at this time.
4,Practical,I don't like to carry a bulky purse when riding my motorcycle. This allows me to carry just the essentials. It's waterproof.
3,Not that functional.,"I bought this to replace my old, ugly Vera Wang wallet which was made of cotton, and falling apart. The Chums wallet has no ID window, no internal segmentation, and it's awkwardly sized so that everything fits snugly in there, but it's REALLY hard to put stuff in/take it out. So I'm fumbling with it for a minute whenever I want to buy something.Also, the keyring that it comes with is impossible to put stuff on. I even tried using a knife to pry it open so I could stick my keys/bottle opener on the ring, and tuck them into that open external pocket, but to no avail.The only saving grace about this wallet is that the penguin is cute, and the fabric seems very durable and can definitely take a beating.I'm searching for something that's easier to handle."
2,Stays with you for a while,"but not in a real positive way. It is such a depressing movie-watching these two march to their death. Kitano's comments reveal his intentions in this movie; namely, that immersing yourself in love is stupid, selfish and destroys both lovers. It's way over the top-which Kitano loves doing, and it's also a statement that he abhors the old Japanese custom of attempting suicide if one loses his or her lover."
4,Creative...Different...,"This is an extremely creative movie; although you have to really pay attention, and take into consideration the metaphor with the old lovers being referred to the dolls.I do not want to spoil it, but the imagery is absolutey gorgeous!"
5,Ladies Pulsar Watch,I ordered the ladies Pulsar watch PXQ388 and I think it's just beautiful! The photo on the website doesn't do it justice. The quality and craftmanship are in a class by itself. And shipping only took 4 days with the watch arriving in perfect condition. I've always wanted to own a Pulsar watch and now that I do I'll never own any other brand!
4,Good book,This book is easy to read and very practical. I enjoyed it and although is is written by a minister the principles of what NOT to do is applicable to business as well
2,This is not a secular discussion of leadership,"What none of the reviewers mention is that this is NOT a purely secular discussion of leadership. Finzel takes a Christian approach to leadership effectiveness. For example, when discussing why people tend to rely on an autocratic leadership style, one of the explanations he gives is, ""It reflects the depravity of man. Satan began the problem when he wanted to get out from under submission to God the Father. So he rebelled and led his own band of rebels to bring rebellion to the world"" (p. 26). Passages from the Bible are used in support of Finzel's advice and many of the examples are drawn from his personal experience in faith-based organizations. I don't have a problem with this per se but I would have preferred to know this in advance. This is not a text that I would be able to use in my organization where religion is considered a personal and private topic."
2,I'd rather play with my dogs,"This book juxtaposes photos of dogs with Zen quotations and sayings. The photos are quite good, and the selected text was chosen with care and thought.I'm not, however, able to make the required leap and see any real link between the words and images in this book. Perhaps I'm being way too literal here in wondering if dogs possess the sort of consciousness prone to contemplation, but I've never thought that Zen was prone to cuteness. Also, the typography used for some of the text pages is jarring, even irritating, when a simpler, cleaner arrangement would have sufficed.I appreciate the merits of Zen and of dogs but yoking the two together does not yield a compelling message or insights. I'd rather play with my dogs."
5,dog gone great book,"I loved this book! As a dog lover, it touched my inner spirit and made me realize how much I have learned from my dogs. The zen quotations and the fabulous photographs made me laugh and really think about how smart it can be to just be simple and straightforward -- like a dog! I can't wait to give this book to all my dogloving friends for the holidays."
5,Dog enlightenment,This book presents in both funny and profound pictures and Zen sayings the wonderful qualities all dogs possess. Kept me in the moment as I read it.
4,Why edit a beute?,"I hate this version of the title track. If you want to hear the song the way it was meant to be heard, get POP. They let me down. That song is the only reason it's not a 5-star.I saw POPMART and The Edge solo on Sunday Bloody Sunday nearly made the entire section weep. I bought this disc for that song only, but was very impressed by the others, so long as I skip ""If God Will Send His Angels."""
2,Not as good as original version,"This one contains four tracks: ""If God Would Send His Angels"" [single version]. This one is not as good as the version on 'Pop' - the lyrics are cut, and the arrangement is a bit less daring (interesting) than the original. ""Slow Dancing"" [with Willie Nelson]. Although originally written for Willie Nelson, the attempt to duet with the famous country singer (as they did quite successfully on 1993's ""The Wanderer"" with Johnny Cash) is clearly inferior to the all-acoustic version of this song can be found on the ""Stay"" single. ""Two Shots of Happy, One Shot of Sad."" Originally written for Frank Sinatra, this is not one of U2's strongest b-sides. ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" [live]. This version of this song (with Edge alone on vocal and guitar) is the sole reason why the CD-single is a must for any hardcore U2 fan."
2,Didn't fix all XP issues,"I am a huge fan of this series. When I found out they were releasing all the games for XP I was extremely happy. However, King's Quest 7 has a problem in chapter 5 with the firecracker exploding when it is picked up causing an endless loop and forcing you to restart the entire game. This was only a problem on XP with the previous game and I expected it to be fixed on this release. However, when I got to that point in the game I picked up the firecracker AND IT EXPLODED RIGHT AWAY. I could not believe this. The whole point of this release was to port the games to XP and they didn't even do that properly. This was a known problem and they didn't even fix it. This makes me extremely catious of buying anything from Vivendi in the future."
3,not quite what I expected,"The advertising for this collection led me to believe I would be getting these 7 games in their original formats... but I was disappointed to find not the original version of KQ1, but the SCI version released in 1990. KQ6 has voice commentary instead of text, but you can switch back to text if you like--I haven't found any such option for KQ5, so it looks like you're stuck with the voice (and no supplemental text, either, so it gets annoying fast). I haven't had a look at KQ4 yet but everything else seems to be the same. I'll be glad to play these games without having to wrestle with our old Tandy, but I wish they didn't get messed with. Especially disappointed with there being no text option for KQ5."
1,Lies,"My gripe is about KQ6. One customer said that there were no differences between the cd and disk versions. This information is false. At the time of its origional release, I was fortunate to have a high end computer (for its time) that was able to run the Windows CD version of KQ6 which had much better graphics and Character Illustrations. I was beyond upset when I found out that this was nothing but the DOS version. I bought this to play the windows version that to my knowlage does not work in any way on any OS past win95 (maybe 98). Those who have played and have been waiting to play the Windows CD version will be very upset."
1,Never buy a product,Because of vivendi shutting down kqix I will never buy one of there games! in fact the most devoted fans to the kings quest series have promised never to buy another vivendi game again because of there greed! And because of this they will lose millions and millions if not billions of dollars! millions of fans around the world are turning there back on vivendi because of this! visite this site for more info [...]
1,kings quest,"poor quality ,out of box you can only play KQ7. almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is."
1,Won't even play.,Crashed XP service pack 3. Made me need new computer. Never got a chance to play this. Not worth a dime.
1,"Oh, that's lame.","What a pathetic product! All they did was repackage the series, exactly as they were. Works on Windows XP? Yes, but only because they included an OUTDATED version of DOSbox, a DOS emulator, on the CD.It should be noted that DOSbox is a free download anyways, so if you already own the games, you have NO reason to buy this. You are getting nothing new.I'm very disappointed. I had expected them to actually put some work into this. Instead, all they did was slap everything together and used some else's work to claim WinXP compatibility. Pathetic.I suppose if you don't own copies of the original games, this might be worthwhile. If you do have them, don't waste your time with this.[edit] Let me clarify: The King's Quest series is awesome. You cannot go wrong wanting to play any KQ game. But this review isn't about the series as a whole, it is about this specific product, and how unbelievably poor it has turned out to be."
2,Great Game/ BAD EDITION,"I loved this game as a child and I spent many hours playing it. I was incredibly excited to be able to play it on my Laptop. OOPS they didn;t update any of the drivers for the first two games (Kings Quest 1 & 2) so after about 15 minutes of playing you can't see the screen due to all of the graphic errors. There are no patches available as of yet and it dosn't look like any are on the way. I feel pretty ripped off. It says on the cover in big print. ""Runs on Windows XP."" Barely, and not very well when it does. If you are interested in this game check to see if Vivendi has done any patches before you buy it or you will be disapointed. Better yet download one of the fan-made editions for free online. They work."
2,You can never go back (At least on XP),"I remember the King's Quest series with fondness. It was the first set of games I had for my first computer. I played it over and over again. I loved the fairy tale aspect.I was ecstatic to get it when Sierra released it for XP systems. But I just wish they had actually fixed the games to work with today's graphics cards and processors. Having my graphics at the lowest level, having to play in a window instead of full screen, having the timing go way too fast for the game (I don't know how to describe it, but a character has to carry a firecracker to a tomb. But my processer is so fast, the character would blow up immediately each time she picked it up). It was all too much and I wound up uninstalling it. There's only so much frustration I can take.I loved the games, when I had an older computer. Now, they just don't work for me. They may work for others, but for me, King's Quest will have to stay a memory."
2,Slight Let-down,"As other reviewers have said, this product ""runs"" on Windows XP- if you download an additional program to allow it to run. The KQ6 is the original version rather than the more attractive second version, which was disappointing. The games are worth playing mostly for sentimental value, and they are fun, but this isn't the best release of these games."
2,big dissapointment,"I was a huge fan of Kings Quest, and getting this for Christmas was so excitting, even though we could only get KQ7 to work, because it was my favorite. Then I got to chapter 6 and keep dying from a firecracker and can't finish the game. No support, no answers as to why. I really hoped this would be a ton of fun, but I'm running into nothing more than walls now."
2,Kings Quest Collection,"Disappointing. I remember playing this when it first came out. Now, I cannot save a game anywhere...something is wrong."
1,not compatible unless you have window 3.1 or 95!!!,"DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE AN OLD SYSTEM!!! I loved these games back when they came out! I wanted to play them again..however, they are not compatible if you have a Windows system. only KQ7 works enough to actually play. i am so sad!"
3,My Review,"I ordered this game because me, my brother, and my father used to play two of the games when I was young. Being able to play the games again brought back so many memories. Easy to download and very inexpensive!"
3,Kings Quest Compilation,"I eagerly awaited receipt of this game only to be somewhat disappointed. First off the graphics don't look as they are portrayed on the game box. The game graphics are 8 and 16 bit for the first three or four games, which if you've been playing games for any length of time you will remember those were the graphics associated with 286 and 386 intel computers of yore. Second, without a hint guide getting through the game might be an exercise in patience. Having been an owner of each of these games at their original release, I recall that some of the puzzles were solved with the most obscure solutions possible; and without the hint guide, I wouldn't have solved them at all. Needless to say, I have not finished any of these re-released versions yet. Unless you enjoy not finishing the games you buy, pass on this one."
3,a good book,"I enjoied this book, but I feel it is a bit unrealistic. I liked the dancing descriptions, but the superiority of the main charachter compared to the other charachters was annoying. Maggie's scornful attitude to an overweight dancer was just mean. And her mothers helpless attitude just got on my nerves. This book did not live up to my expectations."
2,Awkward to use. Doesn't fit larger/smaller wine bottles,Good only for use in a wine bag or other enclosed bag. The velco strip is too small so it doesn't wrap properly around many wine bottles.
4,Just what I needed,"Okay, it's a steel bracket, but it's just what I needed. I have limited space in my townhome and really had nowhere to hang a heavy bag unless I bought a stand but again, space is limited. My garage has become my gym and I didn't have anywhere to hang this other than from the steel beam that runs across the garage. I didn't even know they made these for heavy bags until I did a random search. This is an extremely sturdy bracket and it does what it's supposed to do. I have an 80 pound bag hanging from it. My only thought about this is that it might have been a good idea for this to have a nylon locking nut, rather than an all steel nut that I think will eventually wiggle itself loose. Otherwise no complaints. Very sturdy and heavy gauge steel and I would highly recommend this item."
3,Does pretty well,This will hold a heavy bag. My issue is that it doesn't clamp tightly enough on the i-beam that I have to keep it from sliding up and down the beam. So you basically have to hit the bag so that it won't slide sideways. I'd prefer to be able to work around the bag 360.
1,STOP! Don't waste your time!,Unless you are completely clueless on timeshare sales this book will teach you NOTHING! I have only been selling one month and still did not benefit from reading this book one bit. Ninety percent of the methods for overcoming objections are ridiculously silly and would probably make your tour laugh in your face. I sent it back. Save yourself the trouble.
1,haven't bought it but check this out..........,"go to page 5 and look at the word ""tention"" towards the bottom of the page. When a book has misspelled words in the first 5 pages I have to say BEWARE!"
2,Don't Stop The Carnival [ENHANCED CD] by Jimmy Buffett,"If you like ""live"" music with all the background noise, it's about a ""5"" at best."
1,PLEASE STOP THIS CARNIVAL,"Ahh Mr. Wouk, what have you done, allowing one of the best pieces of Caribbean literature to be stripped of wit, charm and rhythm by JIMMY BUFFET? This CD is wrong on all counts. It is surely one of the worst stage-musicals ever written since it doesn't evoke a mood or a character through the music and the lyrics read like they were carved with a sledge hammer. A prime example is that the dance of love- the Tango-was chosen to introduce the classic boor, Lester Atlas! On a purely 'musical' level, even the steel drums are passionless and the rap leaden. Jimmy Buffet chose to work within his own rum-soaked framework of the Caribbean and never once approached the mood of Harry Belefonte's ""Don't Stop The Carnival"" which the main character constantly hums to himself!He never once EXCITES us. I'll wait for a collaboration between equals to bring one of my favorite books to the stagebecause Buffet isn't capable!"
2,"Long anticipated, but falls short of expectations","An avid Parrot(t)head, I continually marvel at Bubba's literary and musical efforts. This time, I was disappointed. The music, in and of itself, is evocative of The Man, but misses in spirit. I think a video of the musical would be a better stand-alone effort. Unless you're a huge fan of the Wouk volume, or have to have this to complete your collection, don't bother. Sorry, Bubba, but this one didn't do it for me. Too commercial.Note to other reviewers: buy a dictionary. (this IS a bookstore!)"
1,"the worst Buffett, ever.","This is the worst music Buffett has produced. Have the CD, took the family to the concert, awful. When compared to ""Floridays"" and ""Off to see the Lizard"" (both 6 stars!), this shows how commercial Buffett has become."
5,There isn't a word in the dictionary to describe it!,"This is, without a doubt, Jimmy's best album. After listening only once, I had all the songs memerized and was annoying my friends with my interpretations of the songs (I, unlike anyone in the cast, have a horrible voice). Because Jimmy and the cast portrayed the story with such emotion and reality, I knew the entire story just by listening to the cd. I am excited to see it on stage when it comes up North (is it?). A great all around album."
4,"Study music, but darn good","Before buying the CD, I read the book by Herman Wouk. The book made me laugh and almost cry(lol). A great story. So Jimmy and Herman get together, yadda, yadda, need a soundtrack for the play. So what does the buyer of this CD get in return for the hard earnest money they pay? Music that reminds you of the characters and events from the book. Music that was made to be performed on stage. This is not movie music, this is stage music. If you haven't read the book, don't buy the CD. If you have read the book, this is great music for relaxing, studying, and reading. And you'll ever find yourself singing to the music."
5,Love It!,"Herman Wouk and Buffett collaborated on a musical which, from what I have heard, may not have been seen by a broad audience. Unfortunately, I never saw the musical but have been playing the album for years, over and over. I live part of the year on a Caribbean island much like Kinga, and so give a copy of Wouk's novel of the same name and a CD of the musical to friends who are coming to the Caribbean for the first time. The lyrics and scores of the songs tell the story most visually!"
4,"You will love it.... But, first ""Read the Book""","I love it, my wife loves it, and my 2 daughters love it. Face it, the CD is enjoyable. However, without having read the book (after the purchase of the CD, for me) it makes much less sense. When you look at the origin of the CD (creating a musical) it becomes more clear. Some of the lyrics threw me (Like in ""Fat Person Man"" what is ""I will keep him on the beach at the barbaque""?). Like I said, Reading the book helps. Reading the book puts everything in perspective. ""Time to go home"" is wonderful. ""Calaloo"" makes you want to move. My personal favorite is ""Kinja Rules"". I don't know if it is the beat, the running diolog or the humor of the situation and how it is presented. Yet, I know I like it. I think the characters from the book were well represented and I enjoyed ""getting to know them"". All in all, I feel this is in keeping with Buffett's other works. The theme remains the same.... Have some fun, have a drink, have some more fun!!!"
5,Buffett meets Wouk and the result is a Carnival,"If you like Jimmy Buffett and have read Herman Wouk's ""Don't Stop The Carnival"" then I think you'll love this CD. I know I do. As only Jimmy Buffett could do, he has taken his band members and cast them into the various characters in Mr. Wouk's novel. As the CD moves on, I can see Jimmy as Norman Paperman, Mac McAnally as Hippolyte, Tina Gullickson as Iris, and Nadirah Shakoor as Sheila. The rest of the Coral Reefers also do a wonderful job. I truly enjoyed hearing each of them sing while playing the role of their character. The CD moves along with the flow of Mr. Wouk's novel perfectly. I can't stop listening to it, but know I will soon, so that I can read Mr. Wouk's novel once again. Hopefully the musical will make it where I live someday. Thanks Jimmy, The Coral Reefers, and Mr. Wouk. This is incredible!"
3,I would like to see this on the stage,"I'm not a Parrothead and have often found Buffett's music to be repetitive and trapped in the Island sound, but he puts that sound to good use here in this adaptation of Wouk's book. Lively songs carry the story well and the occasional bad lyric (""I never acted like some nervous rookie/right from the start I was hot as a cookie"" Huh?)is forgiven in this easy going look at the difficulties of adjusting to the island way of doing business. The stage version of this must have been fun as these songs lend themselves to an interesting evening of song and dance. Maybe someday."
2,Poorly engineered,"The stool leaves a lot to be desired. It is fine in the open position, stable and comfortable. But trying to fold it is ridiculously hard. The bracket that secures the folding leg grips it very hard, and a significant amount of force is needed to release the leg for folding. Also, in the folded position the stool would not stay upright in the shower stall, it fell over constantly. I gave up on it in the shower and now keep it in the garage to sit on when washing the wheels of my car. I replaced it in the shower with an excellent folding teak stool I found at Bed, Bath & Beyond, it takes up less room, folds easily, and does not fall over when leaned on the shower wall."
2,I Should Have Waited.,"It Waits? I can think of a similar, but more appropriate title for this film: ""It Sucks."""
4,At least the monster was scary looking!,"lol, this movie was a hoot! The actress was the worst. Luckily, the actor who played her boyfriend, Dominic Zamprogna is so hot! He's the reason I purchased this dvd. Luckily, for him he's now on General Hospital and doesn't have to act in horrible movies like this. I think the parrot acted better than the actress.Even the sex scene couldn't save this movie. When Dominic(Justin) gets killed, I lost all interest, but at when they finally showed the creature, at least that was pretty good. the ending was so stupid. If only the stupid woman could have thought of it before Justin was killed, maybe this movie could have been saved! lol Anyway, sorry, but I really can't recommend this movie to anyone. LIke I said I bought it because Dominic was in it."
3,"The best ""B"" movie I've ever seen",I was expecting a totally laughfest and it turned out to not be so bad. You know it was predictable as most horror flicks are but was a fun hour and a half spent with my older teens. The special effects weren't bad either. Not so bad....
5,This documentary is awesome...,"Yes, it's a documentary hosted by a comedian. While he doesn't actually go 5 days with no sleep, he does go a while and then get piss drunk. The effects are awesome and the comedy flows. I love it!Although, when I purchased...it was NOT 80 bucks!"
5,Know What your getting into,"If you're a fan of Gavin and StreetCarnage you'll love this.If you're not a fan, than you're a dweeb. Get outta here, dweeb."
3,It's time for a revision!,"This book has some good information, but much of it is now outdated, and no longer accurate. I would hope that there is going to be a reprint soon. This book is no longer the help that it was five years ago.THere"
1,Too Pessimistic for Women in My Situation,"I ordered this book after being put on bedrest for pre-term labor and found the chapter on this subject to be anything BUT encouraging. The author makes it sound like pre-term labor is a death sentence for your unborn baby because of the experience she had, and according to her, there is virtually no hope of having a baby anywhere near term if you have this condition. There are other subjects in the book such as Gestational Diabetes, PIH, etc, which are less drear, and I'm sure they are of help to women experiencing these conditions, but as a whole, I was disappointed with this book. After several chances, I stopped reading this book because of it's bleak outlook on a common pregnancy complication."
4,Awesome!,"This book is a wonderful, comprehensive source of information for many of the complications of pregnancy. Each complication is explained well. I ordered this book and I also ordered the book ""Days in Waiting...A Guide to Survive Pregnancy Bedrest."" This, too, is a great book, and the two books are very complimentary. These two books are essential for understanding complicated pregnancies, and coping with them, especially if you're on bedrest."""
5,Great Genes,I would never miss a book by Barbara Daly. Great romance and humor...she keeps you reading.
1,"astonished; no verbal cues on 2nd disc - buy ""Yogi's Companion"" by Lauren Petersen instead","i wish i'd read all the low reviews before i blew the cash on this DVD set. it is astonishing that there are no verbal cues at all on the 2nd disc. to have to look up at the screen to see what she's up to next is extremely bad for the neck and thus blows the whole zen of the practice.it seems that people are IN LOVE with seane corn -and that's OK- as she's a very good technician. her vocal tone is a bit abrasive at times but she definitely knows what's proper alignment and breathing.gaiam should be ashamed. the DVD set is just bad. if you want a great challenging audio practice (but no visual) try ""the yogi's companion"" by lauren petersen. it's excellent."
4,Simple and beautiful DVD,"I have practiced yoga for aroung four years and bought this DVD because it is vinyasa. I expected it to be a little more challenging than it is, however. Seane Corn does an outstanding job instructing and her philosophy and articualtion are beautiful - this makes it perfect for a beginner. I'm not quite sure what to do with the second DVD that is just Seane doing a complete vinyasa without ANY instuction or cues. This would be great if I had the sequence memorized so I could follow her without having to look at what she's doing or going to do next, but then again, I might as well just do my own in that case. Some simple sequence cues would be nice. All in all, it is a well done, very strategically taught beginner's vinyasa video. It is also helpful for teachers who teach a beginning yoga class since her instructions are insightful and explicit."
3,disappointed advance student,"I was looking for something to fill in the time after the birth of my daughter before I returned to the gym. My yoga instructor suggested Seane Corn, but this is not the DVD for me.From my pov, this a very beginner DVD, an excellent beginner DVD, but as an advanced student I was frustrated. There is a lot of explanation and her theory (her attention to detail is excellent), and a verrrrry sloooow flow. Too slow for me and while I suppose I could breath slower, I'm looking to really warm up and give the body a work out, which this didn't do for me. Plus the lack of audio on the second disc is a huge negative. For me, once I know a routine, the audio is the most important part, cueing me to move from pose to pose. This forces you to constantly look at the screen to follow, which takes you out of alignment and out of the moment."
3,Best for beginners,"Intermediate to advanced yogis should stay away from this one. It is excellent for beginners as Seane goes into great detail regarding each pose. As you will read in previous reviews, DVD #2 is befuddling. All it encompasses is Seane going through what would probably be an excellent series if only there were some verbal cues to follow. It's not practical to keep your eyes on the screen while doing poses, it almost seems anti-yoga. Why would anyone do this? Unless you are into just watching someone perform a yoga routine, the second DVD is a waste.I would recommend this to beginners who want to learn correct postures which you would then be able to incorporate in other guided work-outs."
2,yoga review,The tapes demonstrate good technique and form. The poses are good for beginners and similar to what I have experienced in other beginning classes. The beginning of the first tape has too much talking and then the second tape has no talking at all. It is very difficult to participate in the yoga poses using correct form and breathing to get the desired benefits when there are no verbal cues as to when to change poses. You have to constantly turn to see if she has moved or not. I have use many excercise tapes and have never had one without at least the option for verbal cues.
3,"It was ok, not a great one for practice, just guidance!","I do like Seane Corn; she is inspiring and very beautiful to look at and listen to. I just found both of these DVDs to be very slow, and not intended for the best practice. They do have lots of guidance and tips so it is nice to watch but I really wanted something to practice to. I ended up selling them to someone who will hopefully make better use of them!!"
1,No voiceover! Hard to follow,"With no narration on the 2nd ""flow"" series, the dvd is useless. You have to keep looking at the screen instead of moving through the flow with verbal cues. Don't bother!"
2,"I love Seane Corne, but find this video a little disappointing.","It would be so great if the second video provided some spoken guidance instead of just being a silent vinyasa routine. There is no way that I could follow this without stopping, pausing the video and watching the sequence over and over - which defeats the purpose, I think. I don't really understand why there's no narrative. I purchased this after listening to a beautiful interview with Seane Corne via On Being."
1,not a vinyasa practice,"The two DVD's have nothing to do with each other! The first one is instructional and it is ok, but full of incorrect directions, she is inconsistent with giving you the names of the poses, & it is not a vinyasa flow. But, not a bad workout so, you move on to the next dvd & think she'll put it all together for you.... you are wrong. The second dvd has no instruction, no pose names called out,....nothing but silence. How are you supposed to follow along, breathe, find yourself in the poses and watch? I was so frustrated by this expensive set. Save your money."
2,not the best yoga dvd,"I wouldn't say I didn't like the practice itself, but the way they introduced it on the dvds doesn't make much sense. DVD 1 has too many instructions (would be ok if Seane didn't speak too fast, it's just distracting). So I tried DVD 2 - their breathing practice, and this one is absolutely useless. No verbal instructions at all - I don't know who could use it - unless you have extra pair of eyes on the back of your head, or you first learn this practice by heart:)"
4,great for beginng yogi's!,I would recommend this DVD to those who are new to the practice. It is a bit slow if you have been practicing for a while.
1,INFURIATING,"I really wish someone had avised me against buying this DVD. It was the most expensive on the rack but looked more appealing than the others, which should have tipped me off. I just want to know, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE WORKOUT PORTION OF THE DVD (DVD#2)??? There is absolutely no voice or voice over and you have to keep your eyes glued on the TV the whole time!!! I really would like to know how you're supposed to meditate with your eyes closed, do downward dogs and child's poses while you have your face glued to the TV. This is a ridiculous and amateur mistake and anyone who buys this should be refunded their money. It's a darned shame. I feel truly ripped off."
3,Hoping for more ...,"I was expecting a really envigorating routine when I decided to purchase ""Vinyasa Flow Yoga"". Seane's reputation is of top quality, but I get a more challenging and fun practice from my local park district teacher than from this DVD. It's great for beginners and really shows Seane's deep dedication to this practice, but it does not challenge intermediate level students that are looking to go deeper into advanced yoga asanas.Seane, when will you come out with an advanced DVD?If you're looking for an evigorating Vinyasa routine, try Shiva Rea's ""Yoga Shakti."" It really develops upper body strength and deep flexibility. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to strengthen their practice."
2,Second DVD very frustrating,"While I enjoyed Seane's instructional DVD (part 1), the second DVD was ridiculous. I understand the appeal of a lack of verbal instruction, but this was lacking cues, as well (i.e., ""dog pose, upward facing dog""...etc) so you have to keep your head turned the whole time to see what she is doing! It is impossible to fully embrace a pose when your head is turned to see what is happening next. That was a huge mistake to leave out the cues. I feel as though I did not get what I paid for--very disappointing and frustrating."
4,"Good Solid Vinyasa Workout, No Surprises","Once again, in her second DVD Vinyasa Flow, Sean Corn provides a good solid workout. There definitely are no surprises to the routine, which places its foundation on basic Sun Salutation and Down Dog movements. The flow of this DVD is consistent and each posture flows very naturally into the next, nothing feels unnatural or overstraining. Corn is one of the best when it comes to good flow and breathing. My only complaint, as it was in her first DVD, the actual 60-minute ""breathing session"" workout has no verbal cues, just the sound of Corn breathing. Beginners especially will find that somewhat irratating, because they will have to keep looking up at the screen to see what to do next. Seasoned yoga practitioners, though, will adapt to non-verbal cues more easily after a couple of sessions."
3,Needs a few words,"I was a bit disappointed with this DVD. I'd been doing yoga for about a year when I received this DVD. The Instructional Session(disc 1) is diffenately for beginners. Sean gives excellent instruction, but I was quickly bored with it. The Breath Session(disk 2) has ZERO instruction: she doesn't speak a single word! I would have liked her to tell the name of the position to move into. Eventhough this is excellent for the breathing portion of your practice (you actually hear Sean's breath), I found that I had to look at my TV too often(which is not too great for yoga poses). I often find myself in a twist too long or not long enough when I look back at my television. I felt as if I were spying on Sean Corn's private yoga session."
3,children of the corn - revisited,only joking with that title - everytime I searched for Seane Corn that title came up first!I am giving this 3 stars for the Seane Corn fans out there who will probably enjoy anything with Seane in them.I guess I agree with the other reviewers who stated their frustration at having to turn their heads to look at the screen for the advanced version. And the basic part too slow and a little boring.I felt there was nothing new here and no chaptering?To end on a positive note: The production quality was good and Seane herself seems like a pretty good yogi.
2,A bit disappointing,"When I Seane's DVD, I was very excited to do the practice. I have read such good things about her in magazines, and heard great things from those who have been in workshops with her. But as I was previewing the DVD, I found myself getting extremely bored. I guess it would be okay for beginners who want a hardcore breakdown of EVERYTHING, but for someone who has been practicing for a few years, this DVD isn't anything special. I wish she would've added a more advanced workout on the DVD as well. I know she's amazing because I've seen her in the Bryan Kest videos, so what's the deal Seane?"
4,Great beginner's yoga dvd for vinyasa flow,"This dvd is a great introduction to vinyasa flow. Seane breaks down the postures in a way that makes them accessible for beginners. However, some beginners may have difficulty in holding the poses for the length of time it takes for her to talk through the alignment. Having said that, I love Seane's style of teaching, she seems very approachable and authentic. I also appreciate her no-nonsense, direct approach without any weird esoteric baggage."
2,Too much talking,Too much talking on Seanne Corn's part. I wished for more yoga and less of her adding her own voice and commentary. I do not enjoy this DVD.
2,Good for beginners BUT very slow for other,"This is a good DVD if you are a beginner. Seane takes the time to really explain yoga and go over correct alignment. If, however you are adv. beg or intermediate level yoga practioner it is a very slow DVD and not very challenging."
3,"so many yoga DVD's, so little time","The breathing and prayer sequence at the beginning of this DVD is great and something that I continue to practice before using other DVD's for asana sequences. I would recommend this for beginners to yoga because her instruction on proper alignment is quite good. I find that the asanas she chooses are not very challenging and do not flow well, and she either talks way too much (regular session) or not at all (breath session; don't do it unless you either memorize it first or don't mind constantly glancing up to see what she's doing, taking the focus off your practice)."
2,could have been sooooo much better,"Love Seane Corn and was super excited for this dvd. The breakdown of basics first disc was great, but wanted so much more from the 2nd disc which was breath centered...Ok Seane, how am i supposed to follow you in motion & breath if you're not talking?! I don't practice yoga so that I can sit & watch you do it...I would have loved for a little narration & direction in the second disc, what a bummer!"
4,Good for beginners,"It hurts me to give Sean Corn less than 5 stars because I can feel her enthusiasm and love for what she is teaching and she is obviously totally genuine but I, a beginner, have fairly quickly outgrown the DVD. The session spends too little time on each pose (three breaths rather than five) and the yoga ""workout"" is not what I wish it were. On the other hand, no Yoga DVD I have is as thorough at explaining the postures and the modifications as this one. If you are a true beginner, this is a great DVD to start with. When Sean Corn comes out with an intermediate DVD, I will be first in line!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"I gave this start 3 stars. 5 starts for the instructional DVD. (This is a 2 DVD set) I think it's a fantastic place for beginners to start. Seane Corn gives you plenty of time to learn and feel the pose and lots of verbal cues . Some people don't, but I also appreciate the spiritual side which is left out in many DVD's focusing only on the ""excerise"" side of Yoga...Okay for the 2nd Vinyasa flow DVD...only 1 star. With absolutely no verbal cueing, those of us who have a TV above 12"" on the ground must constantly look up to see what the instructor is doing. (Ironically, the very first pose is done with your eye's closed)I bought this DVD because I have number of instructional DVD's and wanted a pure flow DVD to follow....this one isn't it. Just a cue that the move is changing would have made a huge difference in my score."
2,"Unless you are a beginner, Skip this one","I purchased this DVD after reading the wonderful reviews, however I was really disappointed.While her form is great and she provides excellent tips throughout the workout, it is very easy and she talks just way to much in my opinion.The second DVD is the identical practice but with no speech. I am sure there are people who can do it this way but I'm not one of them.If you are looking for a beginner workout with a lot of talk then this DVD is for you, otherwise invest elsewhere."
3,"Call it ""Bait and Switch""","I have heard about Seane Corn for years and was very excited about starting her program. As a novice to Vinyasa Flow yoga I was inspired by her excellent cueing and precision on the first DVD (I even bought blocks). However, the second DVD had me looking up her contact information to inquire how she expects practitioners to follow her without verbal instruction. I'm open for advice on enjoying my practice like she is. It's so frustrating lifting my head in down dog to find out she's already moved to the next step. I totally wasted my money."
5,Excellent,"Fantastic program by Sean Corn. She is an amazing teacher. Really simple to follow, so you can just surrender to her instructions. Loved it and highly recommend it."
4,Love Seane Corn,"I have been doing this DVD for quite awhile now and find it GREAT for a beginner. Seane explains each pose very well and goes slow enough for beginners. However, I'm no longer a beginner anymore and tried to do the other disc which is included and I found it very difficult simply because she doesn't say one word, so you never know when to change poses. You have to look at the TV continuously which does not work. I got a great practice from this DVD while I was a beginner, though, Seane is a great teacher."
2,Beginner's Program,"The pace is slow, postures simplified. I hate some times only the instructor's face is filmed on screen and you lost track of the flow. The music and studio background is very soothing."
5,An enchanting adventure story,"This is a translation by Philippa Pearce of a story wriiten by George Sand a famous French writer. The story is set at the end of the eighteenth century. It's all about a boy Clopinet who is doomed to become an apprentice to a cruel tailor. He manages to escape this fate & has many adventures before becoming a naturalist who travels around by sea, fulfilling his dream to become a sailor. Part of his adventures involve his discovery of the sea, learning about the abundance of birdlife on the shore & surviving like Robinson Crusoe. The story was originally written during the nneteenth century."
5,"as always with LIW, a great read","This is the third book in the ""Little House"" series but is a radical departure from the others since it chronicles the yearly events of LIW's husband as a young boy on a 19th century farm in Malone, New York (as opposed to pioneer life). There isn't really much of a plot, but if you are interested in the details of daily farm life during this period from a young child's point of view, it is a fantastic read. It gives a lot more detail than the other Little House books and, along the way, describes such things as butter-making, ""breaking"" horses and cattle, Sunday dinner, clothes-making, shearing wool, ice-cream making, planting crops, going to school, etc... While this may sound boring, it's actually quite colorful and entertaining. I highly recommend this for people of all ages (I read my first LH books in 3rd grade and still re-read them occaisionally), especially children."
5,Still great after all these years!,I loved this book as a little kid and had the pleasure of reading this to my third grade class. They absolutely loved it! Wilder makes her characters come to life in a way that few authors are able to do. She created a mental picture of every detail of little Almanzo Wilder's daily life that you felt like you knew him. My students couldn't get enough of it and some have started to read the rest of the series.Although references to Native Americans seem outdated (we live on a reservation) this book is still relevant for today's modern child and I will continue to recommend it to readers young and old alike.
5,Farmer Boy and the Little House books,"I grew up on these stories and wanted the hard bound books to last longer. I have read them every year and know them by heart. I just wanted to be able to share with my grand-kids what it was like during the time of my Great Grandparents. When one of my boys had trouble with reading, I made him read the books out loud to me. I knew when he was skipping every and, the, a which made it hard for him but finally he began to see the pictures in his head. Once he got that, the reading was a breeze because he got what books were supposed to do, peek your own imagination."
4,farmer boy,"When I read this book, I got interest for pioneer life. I get suprised, because he, Almannzo, do all of his work and helps his family. And he went school that is far away from his house in snow days and in hot summer. I also impressed that his toy is the sled that made out from tree, and it is all hand maded. Today we usualy uses sled, but we don't use sled that are made out of trees. I thought he lead a full life solid. I don't want to live back that time, but I want to play with Almanzo and I want to ask more about his life in farm."
3,this book was okay,I didn't like some parts much. Some parts were more interesting than others. My teacher gave me this book to read but I never got to open it because I moved to a new school but the book was really boring so I read it really quick to get it out of my way. I liked some parts but not all of them. like the part when the foal attacked them that was the worst part. don't read this book for a report take my advice people. It got a little better at the end.
2,don't make me read another word!,"Except for the historical accuracy of pre-1900 farm life,this book is just really hard to read with the baby wordingand situations that may be autobiographical, but couldbe made at least readable.I don't know exactly why I hate reading this one,but it just turns my stomach.Maybe it is the complete acceptance of an outmodedset of values that would have allowed a set of bulliesto kill a school teacher in ruralNew York ( and admitted by the author that the previousschool teacher died from his beating).I don't think the values assumed in this novelare ones that one would want to raise up in your children."
5,book purchase,The book was just as advertised and I have enjoyed it very much. It took a little time to arrive though.
5,Sweet story,"Farmer Boy was the last book I actually read of the series as it did not involve Laura. But once I read it, I as charmed. Almanzo is so adorable as a little boy and I like his spunkiness. Great book for boy or girl."
5,best little hose book ever,"SPOILER ALERT! I loved it! The book begins with Almanzo going to school but mostof the book is about his life on the farm. At school Almanzo saw some big boys (as Almanzo called it) and they planned to drive out the teacher. The teacher went to Almanzo's house and Almanzo's dad gave him his black snake whip and the teacher whipped the ""bad boys"" because they did not come in when the teacher told them to. I can relate to Almanzo because I used to live on a farm. The only difference is that his farm is much bigger than mine. My favorite part was when Almanzo got Starlight (a colt). that was the end and when I got to the end I wanted to read some more. I like this book better than LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOODS."
5,SKYLER'S HEADLINE FOR FARMER BOY,"This is Skyler from cathy's 4 grade . All the boys in my class are reading farmer boy . I think this book is funny , and old fashioned . I've read all the way upto chapter 20 . I like the part when Almanzo give's the pig candy and the pig's mouth get's stuck shut . I learned you should never give a pig very sticky candy !"
3,Good series but............ -Jult Warfell,"I enjoyed the series series, mainly the first half of the season. Buy the complete series. Its still worth owning -Jult warfell"
2,Very disappointed!,"This series is described by having an unlikable main character as an unusual hero. That could have been bad or different. The show comes to be mostly bad. You expect this is a mecha series, which would mean plenty of action. Honestly that is included, but it feels like everything else comes first. Going back to the show's first season it would have been better if the 2 or 3 main characters, Hayase, Emi, and maybe the Juda Corporation president were almost the only ones. Instead a team of more annoying Juda members make this a series of odd humor where robots should be. Although you could still say it has it's moments. As bad as it is, it's not bad enough to rank in the worst I've ever seen. The point is this is really bad, but short of the worst.The animation is good, what you would expect from a recent show. This is almost certainly a show to avoid. I was so hopeful it could be the next great series, and it turned out to be everything else."
5,This Sampler is available for FREE at AIX Records site,I'm the producer of this particular demonstration disc (done 5 years ago in conjunction with Intel) and thought people here would want to know that we give this disc away for free at our AIX Records website.
5,"One of, if not the best movie I've ever seen!","One word. Three letters.WOW!This movie has it all. A great cast, an explosive story, and wonderful plot.John Leguizamo is absolutely amazing. And David Caruso has never been better.Now if it were only available on DVD."
1,This movie was awfully violent!,"Well it sure lived up to its name!Great cast,but a completly visious movie!!!And to top it off, John Leguizamo's hair looked horrible.He looks good any other time. (I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS MOVIE)"
1,Worthless,"Take a look at that web site dedicated to law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty to experience the true 'body count' behind this dispicable picture. The film makers want you to sleep easy knowing that the families of these murderers got their 'cut'. If you want to find out just how low American cinema can go then grab a shovel and dig up this video. Take a friend though, you'll need to work in shifts."
5,A Beautiful Debut,"I loved every word of THE MIDWIFE'S TALE because each word was carefully chosen because the author seemed to care about this story and about these characters, which become real flesh-and-bone people by the end of the book. I loved them all (but especially Lauren) and will carry these people with me a long time. This is a quietly lovely book, one of those that doesn't holler out for praises but is instead subtle and careful and luminous. It has a haunting quality about it that I haven't taken away from a book in ages. Highly recommended."
5,My year's best,"The year isn't even half over yet, but this is one of the best books I've read in 2004. I wish I were eloquent enough to say how good this book is. The dialogue and the characters were perfect, never a parody or a stereotype of hillbillies, the sense of place so strong, the plot always turned in unexpected but appropriate directions....While reading this wonderful book I felt empathy for my unpleasant grandmother, who was of an age and background with Elizabeth. So, to the author, thank you for opening my heart and my mind. A good, and a beautiful, read. Whatever she publishs next, I'm awaiting eagerly. Anyone who hasn't yet read this is now ordered to do so immediately. (Obviously, my order doesn't have any power, but I'm looking forward to being able to say ""I told you so"" to whomever ignores this advice)."
3,Is it real or fantasy?,"The story flows well, giving the reader a sense of another time and place; how it might have felt to be a woman back then in the mountains of West Virginia. Though writing of a time long past, the author seems to know whereof she writes and you, the reader, feel secure in her knowledge.Then, without warning, you find that you are reading a fantasy novel. It is a jarring switch. An unbelievable fantasy romance allows the author to bring the book to a happy ending that is satisfying on one level while also being false."
4,"a good read, excellent storyline","the author draws us into the lives of three women who are midwives in the early 1900's and on. Not wanting to give away the plot, but Elizabeth should not have settled for someone who did not love her. Lauren's gift is woven into the story beautifully. Some of the births were hard to read. very sad. I wasn't sure what was going to happen when Elizabeth suddenly meets David. but the author kept me wrapped up and the ending was just what Elizabeth needed."
2,I really disliked the main character,The main character Elizabeth is not a sympathetic character.I relly disliked her and it took away from teh rest of the story.Some of the other characters were far more interesting.Skip this book and look for another.
3,"Good read, but....!","""The Midwife's Tale"" left me a little bit...""hmmm, well...!"" I found myself getting kind of tired of Elizabeth Whitely's self-loathing, bad-love-seeking ways, and other characters, especially Lauren, seemed much more interesting. I would have loved to have seen her storyline and perspective developed more. Why did such a fascinating character end up playing such a small role in the storyline, while Elizabeth's almost infuriating devotion to Alvin was the main focal point?On the other hand, I did enjoy a lot of things about this novel. There are some beautiful descriptions, striking analogies, and raw emotions, almost too human to bear. The author has a lot of potential, and I would be very interested to read more."
4,A wise and insightful book.,"I picked this book up on a whim at the library and I was quickly surprised by the in-depth, insightful, and profoundly wise prose of the story. This is the kind of book that makes you sit back and think ""wow."" This author is truly gifted at weaving intricate emotions and deep thoughts into beautiful words. However, I do not give the book 5 stars because I didn't like the way the story jumped around and went off on tangents. At times, the story didn't feel focused and I wasn't sure how one point lead to another. But, other than that, this is a must-read for people who revel in the inner emotions that drive us all to live our lives and do the things we do."
2,imitating old style writing is not enough,"The style wont appeal to many people, and copying an old style doesn't make the story better. Under the guise of 'authentic sounding' dialog its a bit juvenile and phoney. Asside from the style, the story is mediocre, but nothing you haven't seen before.I rate the story a C, and the style a D-."
5,A wonderful voice,"With a distinctive and engaging voice, Laskas tells the story of one West Virginian woman who touches the lives of many women around her. Through Elizabeth's eyes, we see life in a relatively isolated section of West Virginia. Laskas's well-crafted prose brings to life the spring winds on Denniker's Mountain, the cool waters of Kettle Creek, and the swelling bodies of the pregnant women Elizabeth and her mother served. An excellent read."
3,A blender of music,"I am brazilian, and I got the chance of watching Quintanilha on stage. He is great, his music is great, but this album is not as good as he is on stage. His second album - Quinta - is way better. His music has layers of inspiration."
3,Home spun history,"While I did enjoy this little book written with a hometown bias, I found it was not nearly complete enough for my taste. There isn't as much history as there is retelling of local myths and stories. Although, there are many great old photographs that show how much the area has changed. The book is written by a man who is local and loves his subject matter and this little book is a must for anyone thinking of visiting Raton NM. It will put you in touch with a little local flavor and it underscores the western mindset and feel of the town. If, however,you are a serious history buff you may be disappointed with the lack of historical fact and the shortness of the volume."
3,Charming!,This is a little charming tale. Very enjoyable. Colm Meany is a wonderful actor who deserves more recognition.
2,2 Stars for scenery,"I enjoy all types of movies and I have a great ability to stretch my imagination. This was one of those attempts to have a serious background in a fantasy movie but the fantasy is so stretched that when the moment it first appears you can hear yourself moaning "" oh geeze "". There are many movies that can bridge this gap especially movies like the Secret of Roan Inish. The scenery is beautiful."
1,Immediately failed,"I got this model because a popular cooking magazine gave it high marks as 'best bargain'. I DID select a 'Used-like-new' unit, so the rating I gave it should be considered in that light. When I received it, I discovered the vacuum cycle did not work, no matter how much I fiddled with the gaskets and the bag position. Kudos to Amazon, however, for immediately giving me a return authorization and promptly refunding my purchase amount. I did subsequently purchase a different Foodsaver model, (V3825) which seems to work just fine, and is very easy to operate."
5,happy customer,"My FoodSaver arrived quickly, in perfect condition and exactly as described. I'm very happy with this seller. This replaced my old FoodSaver, which died of old age. This model is simple to use. The built-in bag cutter is actually quite handy."
5,Very Practical!,"This is my second Foodsaver.After reading many posts regarding different models of Foodsavers, I opted to go with this particular one.I was looking for simplicity but yet practical. This model fits that description. We wore out our other Foodsaver and did not replace it right away. We were tired of freezer burnt meat. Having this once again assures that we won't be dealing with that issue for some time to come.Having the roll placed internal to the machine was nice. Our first unit did not have that capability.When I received this kit, there was a Styrofoam spacer which goes into the drip pan to keep the lid from closing completely when NOT in use. This is very handy. It appears that the manufacturer has been paying attention to the consumers as far as their frustrations in dealing with the sealing or lack thereof."
2,Ok but weak vacuum,"This unit works fine as long as you don't have many bags to vacuum. After a few seals, the motor overheats and won't pull a vacuum and you have to let it rest for 5 minutes before it works again. Perhaps one of the larger models doesn't have this problem."
5,Great buy,"Bought for my daughter as a Christmas gift because I have had one for years - great money saver - works extremely well. Checked the reviews on the top sealing model and went with this one instead, which is almost exactly like the one that I have."
1,Just didn't work,"There will always be lemons among otherwise good products and I got one this time. I have no idea how the product works. Mine sounded like a train roaring through my kitchen and didn't vacuum the air out of my package. Disappointed and sent it back.As with everything else they do, Amazon made the process fast and simple. Thank you Amazon!"
4,no freezer burn,"After having to throw away a huge amount of freezer burned fish, which my husband packed in ziploc bags, I will always use my foodsaver from here on in.I had a Deni brand vac sealer, but didn't care for the light weight sealing film. I also found problems with seals failing with the Deni.After giving up on the Deni, my husband took to using Ziploc Freezer bags, but because of the size, he put too much in and I would end up defrosting 3 pounds of fish at a time, and wasting half usually because nobody here likes leftovers.I was given the FoodSaver and lots of extras by a friend. The Film is waffled and extra heavy. I have sealed lots of fish and meat since getting this product and have been very satisfied with the performance. The bags can be made to accomodate any portion, the film can even be washed & reused.I have not yet tried the canister, but after recently tossing some expensive nuts, I think I will soon!"
1,Poor Product Life,"We bought a FoodSaver VAC 550 and it failed after one use. Replaced it with a V2440 and again it failed after one use. Customer service tells me it is my fault for letting moisture pass through but we were so careful not to let moisture enter. We bagged ground beef, partially frozen, and wiped any hint of moisture with paper towels. We simply can't justify buying a third FoodSaver because they are so incredibly delicate. Bad design, bad build. I am told by a chef you will never see one in a commercial kitchen."
2,food saver v2460,"It did not work and they had no others so I got money back, it was awful loud but would not suction air out of bag at all ...so not happy I had to end up getting another product and not the food saver brand"
1,Did not work,and the company forces you to pay the postage for returning the defective machine to them. So if being played for a sucker appeals then this is the product for you.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,Definitely a waste of money because they are not reliable. A product that cannot be relied on to function and perform as advertised is not worth the Chinese junk it is made of. Works pretty well for the first few months then the trouble begins. Even after double sealing both ends you will find that the air has leaked in and you food is freezer burned. Plus the bags and jars are EXPENSIVE! My Mom used to stick a straw into a ziplock bag and suck out the air. That works MUCH better than these pieces of junk do. Their vacuum jars are the same way. They cannot be relied on- so DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON FOODSAVER PRODUCTS!
3,reviews,"lets review reviews,one star and fivestar reviews are worthless,WHY,one star reviews deal with doa units that never or havent worked since inception, out of thousands of products shipped some dont work,5star reviews deal with units that worked when bought over a period of time but have no history, so when reading reviews forget the stars and concentrate on the timeperiod used,what everyone wants is a product that lasts over time,and works as specified,if not post your review not days but months after the item was purchased and used,only then will w be able to stop the proliferation of ill manufactured goods from flooding the market!!!!,please comment"
2,Loved it but!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased a FoodSaver a little over 2 years ago and really loved it until a couple of days ago. When I went to use it, it was very noisy and wouldn't work. I called the company and they said they were sorry but it was out of warranty. They offered me 10% off a new one. Not a lot of help, they said it was the motor and not just a gasket."
1,Very disappointed!,"Ordered one of these in late March after mixed reviews on this site and others. Received promptly and then was unable to test/use it for a few weeks. Tried it out earlier this week - unit will seal fine, but not vacuum whatsoever. Read all enclosed directions and went to their [...]and checked FAQs & Tips: no help there. Tried their Customer Support line - what a joke! Either you get a recording advising that they're closed for the day or that they're experiencing high call volume and to call back later - then you're disconnected! Item being returned for a refund tomorrow as vendor has no more in stock. Never had one before, but had high hopes for it. Buyer beware!"
4,V2460 Foodsaver,"Replaced a small foodsaver that was broken over a year ago. Got this one and it is much larger than I anticipated. Works well nice that the drip tray come out for easy cleaning. Having the bag roll compartment was not a necessity for me, makes the maching larger. But I have used it and it works great also. Love having it I am single and it helps me to save food and eliminate freezer bite.The reason I gave it a 4 is because of the size takes up a lot of room on the counter top."
2,Worked well til it didn't,This is my second model. They both worked well but stopped sealing after max 2 years. Thats a lot of money to not work longer. No customer support except I am doing something wrong. Seems to be a common problem that should have a FAQ.
5,Great product,Such a wonderful invention. Love this FoodSaver. It was mainly used to vacuum pack fish we caught. We had to throw away so much of the fish we caught before we bought this. Now we cut up steaks of tuna and salmon and vacuum pack them. We've saved so much money. I'm so sad to have parted with my FoodSaver. I gave mine to my mother. Now I'm looking to get the upright FoodSaver.
2,VE706,"Picture quality and color is very low. Most stations would not receive on an antenna. Cable connection is much better, but picture is only fair."
3,Graf,I had two of these units... the fist one the display started to just go black after only a month or two of use. Still had sound but no picture. Returned and had a different one shipped but was damaged in shipping. Figured it was a sign to not purchase another. I bought another name brand - the picture quality is not as good and sound goes to a loud preset after turning off but the picture works. I saw the reviews with the black bars on the side. This can be fixed with this unit by pressing I think TV on the remote control. I had this same problem and called Audiovox and they told me how to fix over the phone. I asked why this was not in the book and the person did not know why. So for those that gave this info in their reviews - those bars can be removed and the picture will fill the screen.
2,Sound Quality,The tv was fine in all respects except the sound quality. The sound was tinny and garbeld. This model did not have external speaker capability. The picture was great.
5,gold recording,i bought this disc when it was first released. it is neat to see the gold disc and the way the disc is showcased. the dics lifts up when you open the case. pretty cool. it sounds good the hear the org. recording on this compleation. i hope richard realeases others like this one.
4,Fresh modern country rock,"If you're a fan of Steve Earle you shouldn't overlook this album. Reckless Kelly have adopted the Earle style and the singer even sounds very much like the old country rebel. In the booklet, Robert Earl Keen writes an introduction in which he really praise Reckless Kelly and I'm bound to agree. The album starts with two very catchy and melodic alternative country tunes with a fair amount of rock. The rest of the material is a mixture of faster and slower songs with hooks and melody in common. The country music style is always present but it doesn't sound as slick as modern acts like Shania Twain or as old as the Nashville tradition. I believe Reckless Kelly is the perfect bridge between the old and the new sound. If you like Steve Earle, Joe Ely, Robert Earl Keen among others, I can almost guarantee that you'll also find this album enjoyable. Dedicated fans of Jayhawks, Scott Miller, Whiskeytown and Ryan Adams might also like this attractive effort from Reckless Kelly."
5,An Incredible Triumph,"Under the Table & Above the Sun gets my vote for CD of the year (2003)! It is really that good. It's the kind of cd that once it finds it's way onto your player, you never want to take it off. You'll want to hear it over and over. The sound is uniquely real and alive, great writing, musicianship and production. Not a clinker in the bunch.Highest recommendation and a request to radio program directors everywhere to give this a listen and some very well deserved airplay."
3,Counting is For the Birds,"After sharing this book with 2 kindergarten classes I wish to contest other reviews by saying my students loved the simple, rhyming text. The format helped my students practice numerical order and rhyming while giving just enough factual information to hold their attention. They enjoyed the illustrations and could identify several of the birds featured."
1,CAPONE SOUNDS LIKE A TRAILER TRASH WHITE BOY,CAPONE DEFINATLEY DOES NOT HAVE ANY TALENT. HE CAN NEVER COME TO SPMS OR FROSTS LEVEL. CAPONE NEEDS TO GIVE IT A REST AND GET A JOB AS A JANITOR.
5,the best latin rap cd i have heard yet,"slamming beats and capone's lyrics have you opening your eyes to some reality type stuff, i read the post about capone not being on frosts or SPM's level, but come-on homie, capone is way ahead of the times. im being honest, and if capone ever reads this, please know that all the homies from Inglewood California love your cd ese."
5,Capone- Chicano world,"capone is hella firme! hes straight cholo and he aint no fake. His rappin is tite and his beats are gangsta, thats why i love Capones music and most importantly he reps tha Chicanos. Keep trucha for the haters Capone theyll only try 2 bring u down."
5,One of the Best Mexican Rap Artist,"Great Job CAPONE! to the one who wrote the bad comment, stop hatting. Seems like someone put u up to this lol."
3,heartbreaking story,"there is a possiblity that this is a hoax. thousands of irish children did suffer at the hands of those there to care and protect them. this book shows how this was achieved, with fear, excuses, lies, control and hate by members of the catholic orders. whilst this book may or maynot be true, the fact is that the nuns, priest, christian brothers and those charged with doing their works, did abuse, physically, mentally and sexually, children in ways that the 21st century knows nothing about.the real sinners are those that ignored it, those that instigated it, those that did nothing, because, real or a hoax, these things happened in institutions run by the catholic church. there were above the law, and the vatican knows. do they care?highly recommend the god squad by paddy doyle, this is not a hoax.The God Squad: The Bestselling Story of One Child's Triumph over Adversity"
1,Truth or Lies???,"Author's family say abuse memoir is cruel hoax.Doubt has been cast on the 'childhood hell' in a Catholic institution recalled by an Irish writerIT IS a harrowing story of a young woman's life destroyed by nuns and priests, and it has raced to the top of the bestseller list. But now a chorus of voices, including those of the author's own family, claim that the ordeal described by Kathy O'Beirne simply does not ring true and is nothing more than a cruel hoax."
1,For baffled parents only,"The title says it all, it's a book for baffled parents who know nothing about indoor soccer (or soccer at all) and are wanting a superficial overview of the sport or coaching in general. If you are a coach, a player, or know anything at all about the sport and are looking for drills and tactics to use when coaching or on the field, you need to look elsewhere."
1,Light on information,"I coach outdoor soccer and the Baffled Parents guide for outdoor is very good and I highly recommend it. This book was very light on content around actually coaching indoor soccer. There was a lot of general info, but not much I could actually take to the field. Instead, I'd recommend, ""Indoor Soccer: Strategies and Tactics"" which is filled with tactics and tips for practice, games, conveying information to young players, etc.So for what it includes it is decent, but for if you are used to the outdoor guide and is expecting the same kind of content I'd take a pass."
5,The Best Baby Book EVER!!,"My sister gave me a copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child care in 1986 when I was pregnant with my first child. Three children later, my edition is dog-eared and falling apart!! It was such a great reference book for all kinds of situations--from colic to potty-training to whether or not they should attend daycare to how to help children through divorce.I have given and will continue to give this to every pregnant woman I know. Dr. Spock's book is truly a blessing."
3,A good basic resource to be combined with others,"Spock always has a good basic resource, but I found it useful to combine it with another book that is very contemporary. ""Our Baby: The First Year"" covers the first year of life in a comprehensive way. There is a chapter on nursing which is written by an authority and gives practical solutions to problems. The book values both parents in parenting--something that is lacking in many of today's books. I recommend this book with Spock."
4,"""Just the Facts,"" M'am.","Dr. Benjamin Spock's classic child care compendium is a tips & tactics guide for people who are both serious and sensitive about their parenting. Dr. Spock's books -- 1st edition to this last one -- have always filled in for that missing aunt, mother or grandma who doesn't live in our nuclear households anymore. The Doc says, ""Just the facts."" Which is why I find those who diss Dr. Spock -- for example, ""farrar"" - the lawyer at Columbia -- to be so laughable. According to these Spock Opponents, poor Dr. Spock can be blamed for EVERYTHING, from self-absorbed Yuppies and 1960s free love to [no doubt] Ebolla Zaire, the Plague and Budget Deficits. ""Farrar"" and Company should take it to the right wing of the GOP ... not THE Baby Doc."
1,It's time he retired - QUIETLY!,"Dr. Spock positioned himself, with the help of mothers in the sixties and beyond, as the guru of child caring and psychology. He was wrong on so many counts, it's embarassing.Embarassing to me because I have to admit I was one of the lame-brained amoebae to follow his every word. And embarassing enough to him to have him recently apologize to all us lame brains and our children.Just take the book off the market and let our bright young women of today read direction, if they need it at all, from other bright, strong self-esteem producing authors.I can't take back the number of nights I let my babies cry themselves to sleep because he said I'd spoil them if I cuddled them to sleep! A mother's instinct is bound is be better than a male doctor still trying to earn money with outmoded ideas"
2,Classic work doesn't translate to the 21st century,"As someone who selects parenting/childrearing materials professionally, and the mother of 2 preschoolers, I am sorry to say that many of the areas covered in this classic work by the famous doctor are sadly out of date. A stronger editorial hand should have updated feeding and other everyday techniques to allow for today's busy parent's schedule. This material was fresh at a time when postwar American wives and mothers worked fulltime at managing their homes. It would be better for today's new mothers to pick up Penelope Leach's YOUR BABY AND CHILD, a wonderfully complete guide for new parents; any T. Berry Brazelton book; or an older series that has been reprinted by the age of the child, YOUR CHILD AT (YEAR), orginally by Ilg, if emotional or social behavior is a concern or you would like to anticipate the terrible twos! I have not received a specific request for this ""classic"" in over 4 years as a library professional"
2,"Come on into the 90's, Dr. Spock!","There were some good points, certainly, but overall I found it to be very outdated. The update revision seems to consist of a few mentions of ""upcoming"" vaccines, like one for Chicken Pox - which is already available. It talked about sterilizing bottles and making formula from evaporated milk just to give a few examples"
5,A Must Have in the Collection,This is a classic book and it's been updated to include lots of new issues as well. I probably would also buy another of the more recent books to come out such as Penelope Leach's Birth to Age Five to go with it. Both of those books together can ease a parent's mind. Spock's on target with the medical questions and Leach is helpful with the emotional issues. All things ocnsidered Spock's is still a timeless classic.
3,"sometimes useful, sometimes not","Spock's book includes a very helpful section on breastfeeding, and the first piece of advice, ""Trust yourself,"" is always good to hear. However, the pages and pages of ""harden your heart"" and feeding schedules and letting baby cry it out are worse than useless: they are heartless and out of date. Western cultures are the only ones who try to fit babies into rigid schedules and make them sleep in cages. It's time to move on."
4,For any new parent,"The most comforting book on parenting ever written, great 40 years ago & still grow ing strong. Great shower gift."
3,An oldie but a goodie after four kids it still gets used,"I receive this book at the shower for my first child which was 9 years ago, over the years I have used it many times for answers to my parental questions especially ones dealing with medical problems. The most usefulness of this book is the quick reference on subject matters as I have always found an answer to my problems."
3,A good basic,"There have been times when reading this book has been very helpful to us, and I do recommend it as a basic source of information. The main drawback I found to the book is the overly agressive (to my vantage point) emphasis placed on a vegetarian diet. I like vegetarian dishes, but I am not a firm believer in vegetarianism and do not appreciate the way the book speaks about nutrition and foods only in terms of what a vegetarian meal should contain for an infant, toddler, etc."
1,"This was ""Americas Pediatrician""?!","I almost gave no star to this book. However, it does give sound nutritional advice, and Dr. Spock went out on a limb to state ""there's no solid medical evidence to support routine circumcision"". He also states the obvious, that breastfeeding is best. For those things I give him a star. As for the rest of the book, I might reccomend certain common sense chapters on safety and hygene to teenage parents but the rest is dangerously out of date. That parents of today are still buying a book that advocates letting a child cry ""it"" out, and suggests that it is possible to ""spoil"" an INFANT by giving it attention and affection is disturbing. This book was given to me by a relative who's parenting style is downright abusive and she swears by it. I wholeheartedly reccomend THE BABY BOOK by Dr. William Sears and Martha Sears RN over this one any day."
4,GOOD book to have on hand.,"I got this book used on amazon and it was worth the money. I looked in it all the time when my daughter was just born, I found answers to all my questions. I use it now and then now for things, when I don't know what's going on. I would get this book, but try buying it used. It's worth having on hand."
1,Is this REALLY Guava Jelly?,"My being a Florida native, I KNOW Guava Jelly. The contents of the jar is jelly, but without the label, I would not know it to be Guava Jelly."
5,Orange Range is Awsome!,"If you haven't listened to ""Shanghi Honey"" yet, what are you waiting for? This is, by far, one of the best songs I've ever heard! Even if you don't speak Japanese, this song will still make you smile. It's very upbeat and fun! I highly recomend this song for all fans of J-pop. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Bryan's greatest album,"""Reckless"" is when Bryan was at his peek.There still playing songs everyday on the radio from this album. From the beutifull ballad,""Heaven."" To my favorite hard rocking song of all time,""The summer of 69,"" This record will be remembered forever.I love Bryan's voice,especially on the Tina Turner duet,""It's only Love.""They should do a whole album together.""Run to You"" is a classic.Bryan Adams is still turning out great records,but ""Reckless"" is his best."
5,Bryan's Best Album,"""Reckless"" is still one of my favorite pop-rock albums. It's one of those rare albums where you can tell the band is having way too much fun, and yet the songs are really good and infectious. The opening riff to ""Run To You"" always make me shiver, it's that cool. I'm suprised the opening track, ""One Night Love Affair"" wasn't a big hit from this album. probably because there were already so many singles and great songs. From ""Summer Of 69'"" to ""Heaven"". And then to top all of this off, B.A. shares the spotlight with Tina Turner on ""It's Only Love"", and the song just kicks. A definitive album from a great pop-rocker. This shouldn't be missed."
5,this guy can rock,"this guy can rock,and this is the album to prove i'm right,with rock bangin' tunes and good looks,it certinly will make u dance on the table.the tunes are pure rock,this albyum made hima international star.here are the best songs in the album.i love the 80's.run to you-a rock moody balled with husky passionate vocals,then becomes a giant rock song.kids wanna rock-a kick-... song that'll defintly make u crazy,with loud guiter rifts and aggressive vocals,thats more like it.summer of 69-this makes me think of good times,a easy simple rocksong with cheerful vocals.it's only love-a duet with tina turner,they both can rock,incredible song and incredible music."
5,A first class pop rock album,"This album stand the test of time, it contains no less than six hits, as far as I can remember they were hits !""One night love affair"", ""Run to you"", ""Heaven"", ""Somebody"", ""Summer of 69"" and ""It's only love""I don't know if ""She's only happy when she's dancin"" and ""Kids wanna rock"" were also played on radio at that time, if so, the total of ""hits"" is eight ! Can you imagine ? For sure, one of the best from Bryan Adams, if not the best.A must have for any 80's pop rock music lovers."
2,beauty only skin deep,"superficial, improbable, predictable ... this movie brings nothing to the lgbt milieu except two attractive actresses. many much better titles out there."
3,Good story but....,"This was a ok story of young woman goes to university but had prior fame and fortune from being a child star on TV.She has to work hard to be a 'normal' girl. Then she meets a tutor who is any thing but normal, shes just simply extrodinary. They enter into a relationship and life looks harmonious.BUT the tv cameras lure the girl back to Hollywood. So a visit home and then back to uni the girl has to sday goodbye to her partner. She does this with more comfort and ease possible in 'real' life.I was disappointed in this movie and the actors looked like too young school girls. Maybe Im getting too old.The story was 100% hollywood so totally unbelievable and fiction to the extreme.Must have been written by straight folks I thought not queer enough!"
2,Great Characters but weak plot....,"I enjoyed this movie but it's something Iwould rent not something I would buy had I seen it priorTo purchase.... Don't get me wrong it a great film from Wolfe VideoI love all if their productions but it just fell a little flat for my taste...It started of amazing, held me at intrigue during the middle but just lostMe at the end... It's not your typical love stories but it's good to see at least once...The only thing that saved this movie for me was Allison Mcatee!! She is just a suburb actressAnd did an amazing job in this film..."
3,good start...disappointing ending,"lots of potential in the way the film began...attractive main characters, decent acting (by them both at least), interesting plot...then the last 45 minutes felt disjointed from the character development and existing plot outlined by the first half of the film...developing the characters fully and exploring their love would have made a great film...instead the movie took a tangent at the end that was implausible and simply irrelevant. oh well, the professor was especially talented; the child actor seemed too young for the casting and too short for the costar but she made up those challenges with her solid acting talent too."
4,Good movie,Enjoyed this movie. It was well written and produced. I appreciated that the professor was a unique character. Sweet love story.
5,The ending threw me!,This was a good movie. I'm always hesitant to watch films that reflect teacher-student relationships. I had to try and remind myself that the student was probably older than she was portrayed in the movie. The story line was good and the acting was too. I would watch more from this writer.
3,Okay movie,The story line of how they met and hooked up should have been more detailed and not rushed. The middle of the movie starts to get better and the ending isn't what I was hoping for but to each its own. Over all I feel it could have been better.
3,A little disappointed !,"The plot was great but the Jackie actress was not right for this part, It seemed as if she was just a child to young and I was waiting forthe police to arrest the teacher for seducing the student.... Maybe she just looked to young for this part.."
5,Wonderful movie !!!,"This movie has it all. Great story, beautiful actresses,superb music ( Ani !! ).No reason to compare it to any other movie.This one stands on it^s own.Love it !!"
2,weak and static storyline.,"don't waste your money. this movie is painful to watch. and what a shame because there are so few lesbian films. the characters are one-dimensional. the story line is static; in the first 6 minutes of the film, you will now how the rest of the movie will turn out. there is bad chemistry between the two protagonist. Also, the college kid seems like she is 15 years, which make one really uncomfortable bc the teach looks to be in her mid 30s. I kept waiting for the film to get better but it did not."
4,GREAT !!!!,"THis is LOUDNESS't third album, and it is one of their best ever!!! THe songs shine, real metal classics. Altough the song tittles are in English, the album is sung in Japanese. Fantastic piece of metal, much better than everything they released when they tried to go pop-glam."
4,Should have been one hit wonder (or two hit wonder) band.,"One of the better albums of the 1990s that you have never of. And perhaps you have may have heard it all before, You can hear traces of Semisonic and Del Amitri to the alternative vibe that was so 90s. Can't Stop It is a nice little noisy lead off to the album leading up to Shining Shirt as one song ends and goes into another song. Highlight of the album is failed hit single I'm Alive which does sound like The Sand Rubies. The album kind of runs out of steam after that, but if you like a good pop record, there are worser stuff out there. But Mach Five was one of many bands that fell through the corporate cracks, and made their one album and then disappear, and their only album is one of the better unknown pop albums of the 90s. Still rates a A minus in my book."
5,Andy at his best!,Andy Stanley continues to amaze me with his ability to make me understand how Scripture applies to my life. This is a great series of teachings.
5,Ah...the memories,"It was so much fun playing these games again. It brought back found memories when I played these years ago. As with other reviews, I wish they had the EGA version of PQ1. I am not found of having to print out my own manuals and the copy right protection charcters are hard to make out but since I loved the games so much, I still gave this 5 stars. I would recommend getting Space Quest and Kings Quest as well! Sierra had the absolute BEST games back in the 80's and 90's! Buy it!"
2,My nastalgia itch is now scratched,"I played the heck out of the police quest series as a teenager. When I saw this box set on Amazon I just had to pick it up. Somehow I had forgotten just how annoyingly difficult these older games can be! Don't get me wrong, I still appreciate these games for what they are, but I much prefer modern gaming over these dinosaurs. Still I'm glad I purchased this item. Sometimes you forget just how far along games have come, and a product like this will make you appreciate your Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto that much more!"
1,Classic collection Police Quest,"It's probably a great game. The problem is that when it was put onto CD-ROM, it would have been nice to have the Police Quest Manual attached, Instead it comes complete with manuals for Kings Quest and Space Quest, but not Police Quest! As the game's copywrite protection has clues in the manual it renders the game absolutely useless.I will be returning the game back to amazon and don't recommend anyone purchasing it until they get this mistake sorted out as you are wasting your money."
5,This is an excellent compilation overall,"The games are really top quality. I grew up playing PQ3 and 4, and not only did I have the opportunity to play the prequels, but to relive the games I enjoyed as a kid. A lot of fun overall. If you are a PQ fan, this really is a must. It's like being a Beatles fan and owning the ""White Album""."
5,Great Game!!,I'm a huge fan of the Sierra games this is no exception. I loved all four of these games. The only think I didn't like is the packaging seemed pretty cheap. Just a box with a cd. The manual is even a pdf so you have to print off any pages you need. For the game I give a huge thumbs up for Sierra's cheap way of packaging I'm not as pleased.
3,Just like I remember!,"This game is so much fun. Very challenging if it is your first time. The game colors were all messed up when I tried to use it with Windows 7, but I loaded it on an older computer that had Windows XP and it played fine. The other way around it would be to temporarily tell your computer to use Windows XP, since all computers have earlier versions of Windows already installed on them. Consult a computer tech, if you don't know how to do this."
3,Police Quest Collection,"I have only installed the first police quest game so far but I am not very happy with it. I grew up playing this game (the original DOS version). This version has the mouse point and click feature instead of having to type all of your commands in. Part of what made this game so challenging was knowing what you wanted to do, and then figuring out how you needed to type it in for the computer to recognize it properly."
5,Beautiful!,"This is a very beautiful book! The illustrations are breathtakingly lovely, and the story is warmly touching -- we follow a wonderful hand-carved chair as it travels through history, attended by the shade of the gentle monk who carved it. A piquant footnote is the addition of a timeline that stretches page by page, from 1492 all the way to 2001, running parallel the chair's adventures.As a grandmother and sometime schoolteacher, I know that some picture books stay in our memories all our lives: Tenniel's evocative drawings for ""Alice,"" John Neil's magical portraits in the Oz books, the d'Aulaires' magnificent drawings in ""Abraham Lincoln."" The pictures in ""Ignacio's Chair"" belong in that company."
5,Sweet and delicious music,"Just check ""From only you"" and tell me if you agree or not. Greg Trooper is a discovery for me."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE,"As I sit on at the computer a lot and have issues with my tail bone, I was looking for something that would not go flat! Everything I tried before this, would go flat and *stay flat* This, at least refills itself with air after the night or a long time passes where I am not sitting on it, but.......it still goes flat and has very little thickness to it after I have sat for awhile, but is still better than the chair itself with little or no cushion and does help some, so I will use it until I can find something better...."
2,Wheelchair Gel Cushion,using it on a desk chair with wheels and cushion leaves only a little gel at front of cushion making it so that you slip forward after a few minuetscausing you to have to get up and sit back which works OK BUT again only for a few minuets. Top of cushion is very slippery.
4,A fine bathtub,"There's nothing exceptional about this bathtub, but we like the shape and size and it has worked out great in our remodeled bathroom."
3,Where's Steven and Christina?,"Verrrrrry dissapointed that ""Cryin"" feat. Christina Milian wasn't on the cd."
3,"Buy it for The Rock's solo, if nothing else","If you need a little pick-me-up in the middle of the day, you can't miss with The Rock's rendition of ""You Ain't Woman Enough To Take My Man"". It was worth the price of the whole CD just to hear that hilarious send-up, complete with the Rock's ad libs. Add to this the fact that you've got a FABULOUS collaboration between the Black-Eyed Peas and Sergio Mendes, and it's money well spent. Those two songs alone make it worth the money."
2,"It works, but disappointed","I ordered this hoping to have a flash drive small enough to put on my keyring. This is exactly that; it's small & thin. However I'm disappointed that the description-included strap was not actually included with the item. The plastic case other customers have mentioned is a miniSD case the flash drive is crammed into.Several times it has crashed the computer immediately upon insertion, while no other flash drive I own has this feature. However a reformat seemed to solve the problem. The read/write speeds aren't anything to write home about, but they're not terribly slow either. The data seems to store just fine so bonus there, but I've only had this item for ~3 days. We'll see how it holds up.All in all, it works, it does what it has to, but I wouldn't buy another."
5,Very satisfied.,"After having never-ending, compatibility problems with SanDisk U3 on my Window XP Home 2000, I took a chance and ordered this simple-to-use little guy for a great price with a surprising 2GB capacity. I inserted the Mobile Key Drive into the USB port, copied my files to it, and was able safely disconnect using Microsoft software, without a hitch and no need to spend a wasted hour plus with tech support. Yes, the Mobile Key Drive is tiny, and I'll probably keep it in the little plastic cover it came in to avoid damage."
2,2 for gore,"The gore was the ONLY reason i gave this 2 stars. The acting sucked, very very low budget filming. It's like it was done with JoBlows video camera. Take some good advice and stay away from this terrible home-made movie. Trust me, i have probably seen amost every horror movie ever made since 1970, and with the exception of Zombie Island, this has got to be one of the worste i have seen."
2,Sophomore attempt,"I believe the genesis of this movie went something like this,""Hey Mom! Can Andy and I borrow the video camera? We want to make a monster movie"" And with the help of the local high school drama class, that's exactly what they did. Very poorly, I might add. I'd like to see one more copy of this movie sold and that's the one I'll be offering up for sale. The one bright spot is the fairly decent demon, slash 'em up effects other than that don't bother. Sorry guys, but I call 'em as I see 'em."
1,its mostly in tagalog !,To someone that does not understand tagalog this dvd is a waste of money. I am disappointed that I bought a dvd I cant understand....
3,Could've Been Better,"I really enjoyed the scenes filmed in the Philippines. The American side made me think that the film's producers think that only a loser from a dysfunctional family would consider marrying a Filipina. I liked the lead character in spite of himself, but come on, hasn't he heard of introduction services on the Internet? Someone didn't do their research. But I'm glad the subject was considered, and anyone interested in marrying a Filipina might find after watching this film that the smart thing to do would be to move to the Philippines. I plan to!"
5,Walk a mile in a Filipino's shoes,"Closer to Home is a high quality, award winning movie with a great story as well as much about life in small towns in The Philippines. I highly recommend it!"
2,Mans search for himself by rollo may,I did not expect a top rated used copy to be filled with the former owners personal comments and notes.i am extremely disappointed !
4,Amazing,"Really makes you think a great book for everyday man going through hard times. In time like this, this book can really open your eyes wide to alot of things."
3,Can we relate?,"The first review of this book is a little slanted-this is a good book, but is very dated. One finds oneself questioning the pertinence of a book which blames our existential anguish on the cold war fears of atomic annihilation. It is interesting, but do not expect to relate to it."
5,One of the best Albums of the year...,"This talented singer has proven once again why she is one of the best singers outthere. Not only does she writes and interper great songs, she has a voice that many of today's singers envy.This collection of songs are not only fun and enjoyable they speak about everyday life.Jenny Rivera is one of the best singers of today. She is also a good example of a working talented female artist.Buy this cd you wont regret it. Number 6 on Billboard Charts in just three weeks classified as Greatest Gainer.. Find out why.."
4,Solid Bench for the Price,"Good stable bench that's relatively easy to put together. I didn't have the problems with the pin that other people did though i suspect they may have put the rod for the pin in backwards (it's not very clear in the instructions). Gave it a 4 because as other people mentioned, it can't go vertical for military presses etc though I was kind of already expecting that. Also foot positioning can get a bit awkward for some exercises on decline though this may just be because I am a bit tall."
1,Bob Vila's Home Design,"not to be bought they are not saying that this software is for Windows ""95not worhted."
2,16 hours on your wrist,"Nice watch, got it fast in shipping!But, you need to be active for 16 hours to keep it wound up, so that it will have the correct time for you in the morning.I have found that this watch, should be labeled for active tennis players only. It has been dead on me in the morning, & I say what happened? Maybe I should hook it it up to a vibrator or something to keep it wound up?I wouldn't buy it again.Amazon recommends that you buy some sort of watch-winder that rocks the self-winding mech. while you sleep.In my days, back in the 50's a self-winding watch had a winding-stem, this doesn't but you never had to use that stem, because they stayed wound up!"
2,Broken,"I really liked the watch except, if I didn't wear it for a day the time got off, and it broke the 12 o'clock mark fell off when I was wearing it."
5,love it,"i love automatic watches i wear this one every day. casual yet nice enough to be warn when dressed up. the links are extremely difficult to get out yourself, there is no pin to remove, i would suggest getting it professionally done"
2,Tales of a lost soul.,"Reading this book was like spending time listening to the girls in my dorm talk about their endless, repetitive breakups, except that the narrator is middle-aged, not nineteen. After a while I started to wonder if all these men are really such jerks or is there something fundamentally wrong with the narrator's personality? I mean, there must be a reason why every single one of them leaves. Maybe it's best that Lucy's alone at the end. Maybe she's not meant to share her life with anyone at all."
1,a terrible disappointment,"Ms. Houston seems to have fallen for her own press, and perhaps to have written some of it. This thinly veiled autobiographical material is as overblown as she is; uninspired, a mishmash of poor story telling and self aggrandizing."
1,"An inferior follow-up to ""Cowboys Are My Weakness""","I had a hard time mustering up any sympathy for Lucy, the protagonist of this book. She seemed self-indulgent and egotistical. I got the feeling that this book falls into the new category called ""creative non-fiction."" Nothing wrong with that, but I just didn't like her. I felt as if I was in a bar with a really insecure, drunk person who was telling exaggerated versions of her adventures, and not listening to anybody else. Pick up ""Cowboys"" for some strong, well-crafted stories and heroines you can care about. Skip this weak sophomore."
1,Self-indulgent drivel,"Why do we need one more collection of stories narrated by a ""heroine"" from a dysfunctional background with so little self-esteem that she allows herself to be abused or treated badly by virtually every person in her life while simultaneously droning about her terror of growing old alone? Lucy's sense of worthlessness is appalling. Enough already."
1,It's getting very old,"Even the reviewers (such as the girls from Colorado) seem to think that there is something cute about picking creepy, non-committal men. ""Cowboys"" was fun, but can't Houston grow up and move along to something else already? When she writes about her adventures and her life-threatening situations, it comes across as bragging. Her insecurity is so obvious, it's painful. I feel sorry for her."
2,Is this the same Pam Houston who wrote Cowboys...?,"I was pretty unhappy with this book. I read it BEFORE I read Cowboys, and almost skipped reading anything else by this author. I was appalled by the fact that she uses REAL NAMES of people who live in Creede Colorado. Even if they did give permission, it made me feel that all the characters in the book were real and if I were one of the ex-boyfriends, I'd be very upset! A photographer?? Please, the story is so autobiographical it's ridiculous!!! Can she not come up with anything any more creative than her own life? This book reads like the author has writer's block and was simply trying to pump something out to keep her publishers happy. The only redeeming parts of the book are the descriptions of wilderness outings. In that area, Houston shines, and that's where she focused her writing in Cowboys....I hope she goes back to writing stories like that, because I was very dissapointed in an author I've heard so many good things about"
3,"If you're Looking to buy, start with Cowboys...","Houston is an amazing writer of stories. Her personal experience is vast. Cowboys are My Weakness is superb however, this second book has disappointed me. It is less compulsive and exciting, and doesn't pull me through to the next story. I HAD to read Cowboys twice, and nearly died waiting for this second book, which has let me down! If you like Houston... pick up Raymond Carver's short stories some time, they'll thrill you."
4,"Keeps you just as engrossed as ""Cowboys Are My Weakness.""","Pam Houston has a real talent for writing about the search a woman goes through to find herself and love. Her writing often stops me cold in my tracks, smiling and shaking my head simultaneously. I enjoyed ""Cowboys"" slightly better because ""Waltzing"" has too much nature writing for my taste. I prefer Ms. Houston writing about relationships rather than rafting or birds. Nonetheless I loved spending time with Lucy and all of her friends and was sad to see her stories end."
1,Get Over It,"Why doesn't she find a new subject? This book is such a disappointment--the fine sense of story is gone, replaced with self- help and psychobabble masquerading as characters. A HUGE disappointment."
1,"Excuse me, but haven't we read these before?","Houston is back, carping on about the same subjects--the river, the tranquility, the men who disappoint her. This time, though, it looks like she's put in some time on the couch--there's an eerie, Stuart Smalley feeling running through these stories--""We're smart enough, we're good enough, and gosh darn it, people like me!"" Her observations, the sly humor, everything that made ""Cowboys"" the great read it is seem dull here, and I think it's because there is nothing new in any of this--it's merely more ""Cowboys,"" and frankly, this reader has had enough."
2,Repetitive and Disjointed,"I enjoyed her first book, as it seems everyone else did, but it seems that Houston forgot that the Waltzing stories are supposed to be related to eachother--that it's not just a collection of short stories. In the first few tales, we hear that Lucy's happiest moment of childhood was when she was in the hospital, that her parents are extremely dysfunctional and alcoholic. But when you reach the ""Waltzing the Cat"" chapter, all of a sudden, Lucy says how close she and her mother are, there's no mention of alcohol, that she and her mother have grown closer over the years...huh? Did I miss something?The writing is repetitive, and Lucy seems to go nowhere. It's all well and good to write about one's struggle to overcome the abuses of childhood and toxic parents, but this is a book and I expect something to be happening, not a continuous whining droning on until the end. Nothing happens, Lucy doesn't grow or change or anything...dull dull book."
5,"scary, it's so good","Sometime in 1990, while driving at 2 a.m. on Rte. 138 in Rhode Island, this album kicked into my brain (I believe it was ""All Over the World"" that did it) and really hasn't left. This is not just the Pixies finest, but one of the Great Records. I have it in three formats and am looking for more."
5,Only those with a nut for a brain would not buy this album,it is time for stormy weather. no better album provides it.
5,The start of it all,"Nirvana and Pearl Jam are given so much credit for starting the whole alternative rock scene, but these guys were the true pioneers. ""Dig for Fire"" is the best track ever. In fact all the tracks are good and all the Pixies discs are killer."
4,This album is almost completely enjoyable,"This album is the one that made me discover ""The Pixies"". I can remember very well the time when I selected it with a friend at a local cd shop and how we both flashed on the violence of a song like ""Rock Music"" or at the catchy side of the incredible ""Velouria"". And by the way, I heard that ""Doolitle"" is probably the best cd of this band. ""Trompe le monde"" is also one of the lamest that ever came of this band. Don't even ask yourself why it is their last official album. I'd also recommend the 1998 compilation ""Death to the Pixies"" to ever pop-punker in the world."
4,Surfin' the galaxy,"From the opening of ""Cecilia Ann"", a surf cover, it's obvious this isn't the ordinary Pixies record. This is California dreamin' meets Roswell meets Dali. When it didn't sell well Black Francis couldn't understand why no one else liked surf music. ""Allison"" plays to the fast crowd, ""All Over the World"" to the mellow. I had heard other Pixies albums before this, but got this when it came out and it remained my favorite.""Dig for Fire"" is a great song and ""Rock Music"" is a beautiful scream-along! But this album really is not about stringing hits together to make an album. It's like an aural postcard of a time and place, and best listened to as a whole. That place may be somewhere between the desert and Mars, but it's a great place for the Pixies!"
3,"Entertaining, but unimpressive after its mighty predecessor","BOSSANOVA, released in 1990, was the third album by the Pixies. Musically it continues the style of their previous release DOOLITTLE: a harsh tone matched to lush production, surf-rock allusions, lead vocals by Frank Black with all his weird lyrics and most songs lasting well under 3 minutes.The instrumental ""Cecilia Ann"" is a fine opener, two minutes of power chords. ""Rock Music"" introduces Frank Black's vocals, but it's a bit of self-parody, as his hoarse screaming is unintelligible. ""Velouria"" is the sort of Pixies song that invites singing along. ""The Happening"" has an unusual amount of variety for a song from this band, withI find BOSSANOVA slightly less memorable than its predecessor. The group was getting a little too polished and technically proficient at this point, and the passionate DIY vibe which somehow persisted through DOOLITTLE is missing here. Still, this is an entertaining enough album."
4,rock music in outerspace,"this is their 'cleanest' album.Black Francis' singing is smoother as opposed to the other albums' more psychotic screatching tendancies ( which is so great too, deliberate ) there is a great feel of interstellar travel here. i dropped it a star because i think the execution of Pixies guitaring isn't their calling card and their drumming is too simple. but if the description 'controlled psychosis' sounds good to you, + u like rock, then explore this band or you're missing out on the best."
4,Much maligned by critics,"This release was much maligned by critics when it came out. In fact it is in many ways melodically superior to Doolittle, and has a fantastic diversity of musical styles and sounds. A great album to crank up on the car stereo!"
3,"Runt of the Pixies litter, still good","Following up Doolittle, Bossanova sounds like the Pixies were trying to smooth their sound out and get a big hit (that's just my impression, I have no idea). However, the Pixies sound is best rawer and louder. The songs of Bossanova are pretty good, and the album is good to listen to. If you have the other Pixies albums, I recommend getting Bossanova."
3,not their best work,"I'm a huge Pixies fan, but this album has never really appealed to me as a whole like Surfer Rosa, Doolitle, or Trompe le Monde do. Maybe it's beacuse those albums seem to work as a whole - Bossanova just seems disjointed to me. There's plenty of good songs on this album, but as a whole it doesn't match up to the rest of their catalog."
2,Boooooring.,"I like the Pixies a lot, but I found this disc to be dull and boring. It has none of the dynamics of their earlier material."
2,Two and a half for a pleasant listen,"The Pixies are a protest band. They want us to know they're not cool and they don't care. Which makes them cool.Their music, whether commercial or not, is 'ok'; Garbled sounding alternative rock with touches of Hawaiian.The gorgeous ""Havalina"", ""Velouria"" and the catchy ""Stormy Weather"" comprise the highlights.While it's cool to say you're 'underground', (which doesn't really make sense does it? Perhaps mining was their day job), and perhaps it's cool to say you have half-baked, poorly mixed music, makes you 'anti-commercial', it doesn't necessarily mean you make great music. Rating 2.5 (**1/2)"
1,Misprint,There was a misprint in the book. It's missing the last 2 chapters and it has the ending of a totally different book in it.
4,Intimacy and Solitude,I read this book a few years back and it helped me a lot. I thought it was such a good book that I recently purchased it for a friend.
5,A+ in my book,"Elton John's Tumbleweed Connection is one of my favorite albums I own and with good reason. This album is just a joy to listen to. Songs like Ballad of a Well-Known Gun, Country Comfort, Talking Old Soldiers and especially Burn Down the Mission are just the cream of an exquisite crop of songs that you will experience when listening to this spellbinding album. Burn Down the Mission in particular is outstanding and just soars beautifully. What a majestic way to end an album that truly is simply perfect. A+ indeed!"
5,Come down in time,"I am so grateful for discovering this Elton John classic recently. I have most of Elton's albums but failed to listed to any of his material before 1972's ""Madman Across the Water"" album (of which the original version of that song appears on this album). This 1970 album is a masterpiece in every sense. From the haunting ""come down in time"" to ""my father's gun"" this album demonstrates the very young Elton John with his glorious voice (before it went bad in the mid 80's). Other treasures on this album include ""southern comfort"" and ""burn down the mission"". Probably the only weak song is ""Son of my father"" which I always skip.This album proves that Elton was a star long, long before ""Goodbye yellow brick road"". Buy it."
3,Nice album for Elton collectors not his best,"Tumbleweed Connection is okay. I think this was his best album at the time but, nowhere near as imaginative, well-produced, or complete a vision as his best, Yellow Brick Road. What seems to unite all the 5-star reviews here are people who don't like his pop hits, and those who like to believe they hear a connection to Dylan and the Dead with this one; nope. It isn't even remotely connected to country rock or bluegrass, unless you count the one Floyd Cramer lick he uses in all his songs; the American wild west motif was the lyric base only. Still, it's a pleasant listen."
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...fans and critics alike think this is a masterpiece, and although there isn't a bad song on the album there also isn't anything classic that stands out. Hence this country-esque album just doesn't rise to the top of ""best Elton albums."""
4,some great tunes on this one,"His third album and one with some great songs on it. Nice ballads and very easy going stuff. If you like the man's songs, you have to add this to your collection."
1,Boring old fart,"This is one of his ""hitless"" albums, and for good reason; nothing on it is very good. The opening track is dull. and the rest are not much better. Drab cover fits the drab mood on these songs. Bernie Taupin's lyrics are very weird, and an acquired taste to be sure. Personally, I'll eat something else."
5,A great E.J. album(CD)!!!,"This is one of Elton John's best!!! Includes some of his greatest songs including:Country Comfort,Amoreena,Love Song,Burn Down The Mission,and Where To Now St. Peter? Great remastered sound!!! A clasic album(CD these days)!!! Five stars!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+"
4,"great songs, great sound","Every song is a winner and the remastering job is top notch. I have only one small gripe. On the vinyl version, the vocal track during the chorus of ""Where to Now St. Peter?"" was doubled but on the cd there is only one vocal track. What gives?"
5,Come down in time,"It was 1970, I was 15 years old, it was Christmas and a future beau arrived at our door (London) with 28 lbs of brown rice and 21 albums, and one of them was Tumbleweed Connection. You had to have been 15 in London in 1970 to appreciate the phenomenon that was Elton John. We saw him in a packed Pub and he played a white piano and danced on a white stool and blew our minds. Then he went to America and became BIG. To me Tumbleweed is and will always be the breakout album that it was never meant to be. ""Come down in time"" aches with expectation of a passionate meeting while ""Where to Now S. Peter"" contemplates the state of the soul. Amorena is a light as air love song in contrapuntal to the father and son bonding that pretty much defines the rest of the songs. But they are all great. They were a gift in 1970 and they have stood the test of time."
4,His best,"Great melodies, great piano, tight band, good lyrics. If ""Burn Down the Mission"" was two minutes shorter this would be a five star album. This was his most cohesive album; what followed was an unbelievable outpouring of hit singles."
5,Great Music,"Each of his albums represented stages in his personal evolution. Growing bigger with each new release, flamboyant costumes and platform shoes fl. His almost classical style, he just plays piano and sings I love this album. Always been my favorite"
5,Elton Connecting with his talent,"This is a fine piece of work it's one of the best albums ever recorded by anyone. This album should be on every 100 best albums list reviewed by any serious reviewer.It's remarkable that it was Elton's third release, and his second world-wide major release. It wasn't a top 40 best seller, but the songs are so finely written and well crafted they stand out today as lost treasures.Elton clearly made a connection with his talent on this album, and it was only a question of time before he became the biggest selling artist of the 1970's.This album is equal to (The Beatles, SGT Peppers) and (Pink Floyd's Darkside Of The Moon).Each time I play it I discover something new, overlooked, or forgotten, and for a album that was released 27 years ago that's really saying something."
3,one of EJ's finest early albums,"elton and bernie taupin really explored taupin's interest in, from a ""english point of view"" how the the ageing wild west of old could be interpreted from a foreign perspective. most of the tracks are rarely included on a greatest hits package or a retrospective of the artist but many of them hold up well nearly 30 years on,personally i own a old, very weathered vinyl copy of this album and if you're a fan of EJ like myself it is ""a must have copy"" for any collector,almost unavailable on cd in my neck of the woods ,i intend to get a copy of this great example of 70's music that stands the test of time as soon as i can."
3,depends on your interest.,"The first half of this book are general chapters on ecology, propagation, uses, folklore, etc.; the second half consists of about 100 treatments per species. To start with the latter: if you're looking for a guide to identify tropical ferns, this is not your book. Contrary to what the title suggests the area covered is Malaysia only. Then there are too few species with too concise descriptions.However, as an introduction to tropical ferns, especially to the Malaysion region, it /is/ a valuable book. It gives a lot of background and facts you won't easily find in other books. It's easy to read with good colour pictures. Read it before you go to Malaysia, and again after your return. But in the field you want a completer guid which, admittedly, is hard to find (try to get a copy of Holttum's Ferns of Malaya)."
3,Mediocre at best,"Although I was feeling the title track the wry musings off this band seem hard to take by non fans.This album when compared to other brit-pop acts of the mid 90s such as blur,elastica,supergrass and charltons uk is a big letdown"
2,HERE COMES ANOTHER PANIC ATTACK,"The novelty of Different Class and even Pulp's previous efforts is missing here. While the album flows nicely, the songs are not easily distinguishable from one another without very careful listening. And it just sounds pretentious or stupid for Jarvis Cocker to say in a song that he has the same initials as Jesus. Someone thinks he is a bit too clever."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"OK, I've looked through all the other reviews on here, and I know that anyone who does the same will probably go with the looming majority vote and get this album but PLEASE DON'T!!! About a year ago I first heard Different Class and thought it was great. So much fun, excellent lyrics, and just really great! the melodies, the instrumentation...amazing. So recently I heard This Is Hardcore. A few of the songs are pretty good (Dishes, The Fear, The Day After The Revolution) but for the most part it's just plain BORING!!! Where did the fun go? This album is sad, dreary, and dull. Yes, it is a darker mood, and I realize that Jarvis Cocker probably had a reason to write such melancholy songs, but after hearing Different Class, who wants to listen to them? Many of the songs sound the same and, while not being terrible, were completely uninspiring. Buy Different Class instead. It rocks."
3,new to pulp,"but i really, really like this cd. help the aged and hardcore are my two favorite tracks - the lyrics are killer and the melodies are somewhat soothing to me..i'm not sure that i'll run out and buy the others they've put out, but this has been a great purchase for me so far."
2,"This is hardcore...yeah, hardcore rubbish!","There seems to be a new trend that's been happenning with great English bands. This trend is changing from being a great British band, to being a mediocre American sounding British band. It happenned first to Blur, whose 1997 self titled release more closely resembled Pavement than the witty, often anti-Americanism of their previous four albums. Now Blur's mates Pulp are at it. Pulp, who have been together for over 15 years, but just gained notoriety in the past few years, had just reached perfection. The last album, 'Different Class' was absolute genius. But after the departure of Russell Senior, their guitarist/electric violinist, they appear to have lost their charm. Of course the American press loved the album, because it is radio friendly, unoriginal material. Any true fan of Pulp is let down by the change of direction of a great band. Let's just hope they get back on the right path (do it for the fans, Jarv!!)"
3,Hmmm...,"I dunno...it's not bad, but it's not great, either. I mean, if this had been the first I'd heard of Pulp, I don't think I would've been moved to buy their other stuff. It's good in its own way, but it's not as good as what came before. I don't WANT irony to be over, okay? The title track, Sylvia, and A Little Soul aren't bad, and some of the other stuff's half-decent too, but the album as a whole is a bit of a letdown. This would be fifth on my list of preference for Pulp albums, after His'n'Hers, Intro, Different Class, and Separations. Still worth buying, though."
4,Jarvis VS. the world?,"Not that I was disapointed by Pulp's latest record, but it seems like the guys (and girl) from Sheffield have entered a new phase in their musical creativity. As an old time fan I can hardly admit that Pulp (who've become part of my own private universe) want to invade pop music and become ""masters of the univese"" (!!). Now Jarvis, come back to your roots, remember the time of ""His 'n hers""!"
