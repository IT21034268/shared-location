4,Easy to set up and use,I bought this HDD about a year ago and have faced no problems.Pros+ Easy to set up on Windows+ Good read-write speedCons- I have not figured out a way to access it both on a PC and Mac simultaneously.
2,Worked for about a year,I backed up my laptop about 4 or 5 times over the past year. Now the Seagate FreeAgent doesn't seem to power up at all. No lights. No action. It's just dead. (I must have gotten a bum unit. Apparently most others haven't had the same problem.)
1,Worked about 3 hours then died,"It only worked about 3 hours properly. Then It shut down all on it's own. It would then shut down in the middle of coping files, or shut down sitting idle. Sometimes I could get it to turn back on by unplugging it and replugging the wires back in, and sometimes this wouldn't work. Sitting dead and plugged in, it would turn itself on sometimes after an hour or two. I had trusted Seagate, but not now.Also it does not have an on/off switch. I prefer to turn it off when I'm not using it. Having to unplug the wires to turn it off is inconvienent."
1,Horrible Warrnty Support,"Two of my Seagate hard drives have gone bad in in about a year. Seagate expires your warranty after one year so you need to send an email to them with the copy of the original invoice.After several emails (their communication is just terrible, I wished I could talk to an automated service than a live person), they told me my warranty was honored. After a week, I checked back on their website and it was showing still out of warranty.All in all, it's taking me more than three weeks just to verify that my hard drive is under warranty. I don't know how much longer they'll take to ship a new drive to me once they get the broken one, but my advice is:STAY AWAY."
5,Free Agent 250 External hard drive,Great external hard drive. Easy setup No problems at all. My only complaint..... I wish I had bought this same drive with greater GB storage.Larry
2,Great 'Til It Crashes !,This external hard drive has quality issues. Read the numerous bad posts. I had it 4 months until I plugged it in one day and my computer would not recognize it. I lost some music I hadn't backed up yet on my other hard drive. The power cord had issues from the start. That's too bad because this hard drive has good transfer rates and it looks cool. I had no problems getting a replacement and they did send me a Desktop Pro model. So far so good on that model. That is the only reason I rated the hard drive two stars instead of one. If you plan on buying a Seagate make sure you backup your files on another hard drive that isn't a Seagate.
5,gk,"Worked perfectly right out of the box,sits quietly right next to my cpu.Just drag and drop.This was a simple plug in and forget it."
1,Failed within a month.,"Failed within a month of standard use.Easy to set up.Easy to use.Easy to lose all that data.Just glad I hadn't yet entrusted it with my photos.Once again, you get what you pay for.NEVER again."
5,Excellent. No regret,"As a totally non-techie, I found this a great product. I set it up and backed up my iTunes and Photo Album in under 10 minutes. I agree with those who felt it would be good to have some kind of on/off switch but that's no big deal."
4,Fast and great warranty but a few gripes,This is a nice unit overall. It quick and has an awesome warranty. The location of the power and USB jack is great because it makes things less cluttered. The styling is ok but they should have made the front wedge uniformally centered rather than offset to the left but thats simply a personal opinion.The one thing that is missing is a power button. I think that should be a feature thats a nobrainer to have and Seagate really dropped the ball by not including one. Hopefully thy se fit to include one on the next generation of these.
3,Works most of the time.,"It works as expected most of the time. Copying files to and from the drive is nearly as fast as my internal drives.What drives me nuts about this drive is that sometimes my computer doesn't recognize it. I think it has something to do with having too many things plugged into my USB ports, but I haven't been able to isolate the problem. When it stops working, I just have to unplug the power supply and plug it back in to get winxp to recognize it again. An on/off switch would have been nice.I wouldn't buy it again because of the connection problem, and there are other choices out there for around the same price."
2,User Unfriendly,"I have yet to back up all the files on my computer due to the fact that certain files are not supported and can't be downloaded.I thought it would be a simple process,however I was sadly mistaken."
4,seagate external hard drive,"i have used the seagate external hard drive for a short period of time only so far but it seems to do what it is supposed to without any trouble. of course, the amazon online store was easy to shop at, and the product arrived as promised."
1,LOUSY TECH SUPPORT,"Product is easy to set up and install. However - BE FOREWARNED - if there is any issue, the Seagate tech support is, in my opinion, as worthless as any I have seen. A two-hour phone call, unknowledgable / rude / condescending personnel, no follow-up phone calls as promised. I will NOT purchase any other Seagate products."
5,This hard drive is great!,This external hard drive was super-easy to install and setup. It automatically backs up my hard drive daily with no interruption to my PC. I love it!
1,Arrived DOA,"Ordered from Amazon and it arrived with a non functioning power supply.It was an easy return to Amazon, but ended up buying another at China-Mart.Seagate must not have a final inspection point in their factory."
1,High rate of defects!?,"I've twice ordered this product, and both times I have had the same problem. The device wouldn't even turn on due to some internal defect, and from what I've seen in previous reviews, this has been an issue. I'm sure this would be a great product if it actually worked.Buyer beware."
1,Doesn't work out of the box. Don't buy!,"Just purchased and it didn't work out of the box. Doesn't even turn on. Very hard to get support - there is not even a phone number for tech support in the manual, and the troubleshooting guide on the web site has dead ends with a 404 Error Message! I'd advise getting a more reliable product from a more customer friendly company."
3,Amazon Fixed the Problem,"When I got the FreeAgent 250GB hard drive it was dead. I contacted Seagate support and they just sat there on the phone after telling them the problem. I could here people in the background, so I just hung up. I contacted Amazon to return it and literally the second day a new one was on my door step. Before the broken one got to them,lol. Now that's sevice and support!!Now the drive is nice. The back up his really nice to have but the software on the drive with a back up takes up almost 80GB. What I really like about it is the sleep mode, so when your not using it you don't have to shut it off because of it wasting energy. Like other hard drives there loud and don't go into sleep mode if not using it. This one does. No loud noise and no reason to shut it off. Very happy with the speed of file transfers and navigating the folders, where some lack. I have now 3 external hard drives and this is my favorite on by far. 1) sleep mode. 2)automatic back up. 3)slim quite design."
1,thought is would be better,"After connecting and I started to use as a backup, Seagate wanted to act as the primary HD, couldn't shut down or boot up my computer, had to pull the USB cable to disconnect, after getting the computer up I tried to backup but after about 5 mins it said that it couldn't backup because the drive was full.?? my data does not even exceed 20 gigs. I just packed it up and shelved it, due to possibility that if I sent it back for replacement might have all my data in it, couldn't take a chance. So I bought a WD 350Gig External HD, so far so good. thought Seagate was reliable equipment????"
4,Pretty Good,"I have partitioned this drive as soon as I got it, I have half for MAC stuff and the other is a Windows format. I have had it for over a month and it works well. Not really noisy and works well. Tried the software that came with it, it was not all that good. Better use TimeMachine or get Ghost to back stuff up ."
4,Yeah,"If this thing didn't look so ugly or have that ridiculous looking base that just begs to be broken off, I'd say this is a very good product.No technical problems (I've had it for a month, though) and it's easy to use. Good times."
5,Seagate external hard drive,This item worked great. I reformatted it as I run Linux on my PCs and plugged it into a USB port and was able to backup all my PCs onto it including all my images. Worked great.
5,"Easy, fast, and inexpensive","Got a raging deal at Staples ($20 less than Amazon). Plugged it in, my PC recognized it immediately, and I backed up all my pictures and music files inside 5 minutes. Highly recommend!"
2,Seems to spur many to rush their reviews of it.,"Judging from the relatively high incidence of misspelled words, grammatically flawed sentences, and expressions of anger in earlier readers' reviews shown here, this book must provoke strong emotions in many who read it.I felt disappointment.I just wish it could have provided firm historical evidence relating to the question of whether (and if so, where, how, doing what, and with what organizational roots) Freemasonry existed prior to the early 1700s. I recognize that is a lot to ask when the subject of investigation sports a secretive history. Still, it seems to be a question sadly neglected by professional historians and left for those with an axe to grind one way or the other to write about.If another reader knows of a book that has focused on objectively investigating the history of Freemasonry in England during the 1600s, I would be grateful if he or she would mention its author and title in a review of this book.Thanks in advance."
3,"Those who love it, those who hate it.","I have read many books about Freesmanorys. Some by insiders and some by outsiders. It is important also to review the readers of this book or any other book concerning Fressmans, before your read this book. I can observe by reading the reviews from so-called readers of this book and the book itself, that they want to destroy the credibility of the author. After reading this book, I would to write propaganda about this book because it infringes one's own secerts of the Organization."
1,an intentional bad interpretation of the inspired texts,"The book has an approach of Freemasonry that is a mixture of Episcopal Church, Mormonism, Baptist Church, New Age Era Religion, Paganism, Lucifer and so on. One can detect clear evidences of extreme right-wing views,radicalism,unbalance,insecureness and also traces of paranoia. The authors show a total lack of knowledge about ancient history, symbolism and especially about Freemasonry itself. This book is actually a waste of time and money."
1,Don't waste your money!,Horribly innacurate and a complete waste of time. Reading the National Enquirer is more accurate and informative than this is.
1,This Book is Absolute Rubbish,"It is evident from the start that the author of this book had a private agenda to fulfill, and has failed to obtain even the most fundamental understanding of his subject matter, instead relying on heresay and rumor. While I am certain that this book will continue to be purchased by the types of people he intends to incite, anyone with any knowledge of the basic principles of Freemasonry, or the werewithal to even speak with a member of that fraternity, will soon drop this book as if it had burned their hands. This book is fiction at best, inflamatory to the core, and absolute rubbish to any with an inkling of the subject matter the author is supposed to have researched. Shame on you!"
1,"Bogus, bogus, bogus!","If you are not a Mason, how can you possibly say that this book contains truthful information? In fact, don't even waste your time commenting. You have no idea."
1,Pure fiction,"Some may hold this book up as an exposition of Masonry's deep, dark secrets. The only problem is that half of the material in this book is completely made up. The other half is a complete distortion and manipulation of the facts. Do yourself a favor and read ""Is it True What They Say About Freemasonry?"" instead."
5,Remember the times when house was FUN,"Remember the times when house was FUN.Now i wasn't around when the N.Y Garage was developing and had its heyday in the 90's, but i was properly taught by friends who did. ""Live at Hard Times"" is without doubt the best Mix-cd from Todd Terry and it remains legendary forever.And for those who where there when Todd the God left you satisfied and sweaty, i envy you. Back in those days, Todd Terry was probably the only DJ who could tear down the roof with only his own productions, and this cd is packed with bangers from start to end mostly from him.Ahhhhh.. those where the times for sure."
3,Decent Noise Reduction for the Money,"I have had these headphones for over 4 years. So you may say, heck you must like them - not really. As with most things, compared to nothing it's better. So when I originally got these headphones and took a flight to Singapore it was great. Engine noise was easily cut by a third. They fold up to the size of your hand and the AAA battery last for 6 coast to coast flight (though always bring a backup). However as I have become a more discerning listener and less willing settle, the 2/3 remaining noise has grown increasingly unbearable. So these will go to auction and I am upgrading to the Sony MDR-NC20 which I have heard great things about."
3,A Compromise,"I've used these headphones for several years (several airplane trips per month) and have been satisfied with them. I've tried the Bose headphones and perhaps half a dozen others, and the Bose have been my favorite for overall comfort and sound quality. These Sony headphones do a reasonable job of cancelling low frequency sound and do a great job of making movies and audio on airplanes enjoyable vs. hard to hear. In addition, they fold into a compact package -- a plus for folks like me who try to minimize what we carry on travel. They do present a noticable high frequency hiss when you turn on noise cancelling, but after a few minutes I don't notice it. I'm hoping Sony or someone else comes up with a similar mechanical design but with better noise cancelling electronics."
3,mediocre,"These headphones have weak, tinny sound and so-so noise cancellation. You can probably do better."
4,After Effects Magic Indeed!,"After Effects 5.5 Magic is a great book for those of you who already have a minimal basis using Adobe's After Effects. This book has great step-by-step tutorials walking you through interesting and creative projects. The book was written collaboratively by well-established professionals that work with this program in the field. I also liked that this book tackled some easy to understand expression problems. I don't know how to write code, but the tutorials made it easy to understand relationships between layers and their properties with easy to understand java script."
4,Awesome book for intermediate users,"Don't get this as a beginner's book - you'll be lost in the first example! Instead, think of this as fodder for your next work of art AFTER you have a handle on the basics. I got several great tips that created ideas that I was able to implement on my own. Great complement to the Trish & Chris Meyers AE books."
3,Creating Motion Graphics is better,"'Creating Motion Graphics' is a much more complete and useful read. This book isn't bad, but if you're going to get one book, get 'Creating Motion Graphics with After Effects'. I bought 'After Effects 5.5 Magic' first, but I can't say it really helped my skills very much."
3,Needs more George please!,"After using many Leslie Sansone walking DVD's I thought I would try a different instructor. And while the instructor is very capable and encouraging it was disappointing to see that George Foreman was not the ""STAR"" of the DVD. I was looking for more of the George Foreman personality to come shining through on this DVD. :(It's almost as though they put his name on the DVD cover just to try to sell more copies.The exercises themselves are fine and it does show various levels of intensity. Just too bland......NEEDS MORE GEORGE! :)"
1,This thing was awful!,"This was most likely a failed attempt at selling some more copies. Being a student of history myself I understand the ""truth"" that historians do not know exactly what happened in the past. They do, however, attempt to reconstruct the events in the past and offer some explanation as to why they happened and how they affect us today.Schama does none of the above. Without any footnotes or sources to go by one cannot trace Scahma's logic and reasoning. Nor can one draw their own conclusions from the documents Schama uses because they simply aren't there. By this I mean he adds a note at the end saying, more or less, ""screw you"" to anyone that wants to follow his work.If one is looking for a good read on the French and Indian War checkout Fowler's ""Empires at War"". In the end Schama's book is perfectly titled ""Unwarranted Speculations"" indeed."
5,"Magnavox 15MF237S 15"" LCD HDTV","Picture quality was excellent, set-up was a breeze, remote easy to use, sound quality is fine for a small set like this. I'm very happy with the Magnavox thus far and would be happy to refer to others!"
3,NOT for channel surfers!,"A good TV overall, but a VERY annoying ""feature"" is the large, on-screen information display that obscures the screen every time the channel is changed. This display cannot be disabled and is very annoying when channel surfing."
4,Great introduction to the theory of concurrency,This book is a wonderful introduction to the theory behind concurrency. All the given proofs are explained well (but references to some of the steps would be nice). The only problems I had with the book is the lack of some references in the proofs and no answers to the exercises.

4,Well-designed and functionally flexible,"I was reluctant to try ebook readers for many reasons, but when the prices started to drop, I decided to give the REB1100 a shot. I'm very glad I did.The REB1100 is a versatile, easy-to-use little reader that worked perfectly first time out. Controls and page-orientation can be swapped for lefties, the backlit screen allows for night or dim-light reading, you can change the fonts and the font size, and with adjustable brightness and contrast, you can reasonably extend the battery life to 30 hours.Registration and downloading worked without trouble, and there is a wide variety of books, magazines, and newspapers available for the reader. I'm using mine for reading on the bus, and currently have all of Shakespeare's plays, three classic novels, and a handful of short stories all loaded up--and that's with the onboard 8mb of memory. With a Smart Media card, you can extend that up to 72mb--that's a lot of books in your pocket.Highly recommended."
3,A Warning about Upgrading your REB1100,"I was very pleased with my REB1100, and when GemStar sent me an offer for an OS upgrade (making my reader into a GEB1150), I readily agreed.WARNING! The software in the new system makes your REB1100 completely proprietary to GemStar! As a GEB1150, you can no longer backup your titles to your PC, you can no longer purchase titles from anywhere but from GemStar, and you can no longer create your own RB files to read on your eBook.As a novelist, I used to review and edit my books on the eBook, saving me paper and time. Now, I can no longer do that. Also, all of the titles I bought from other sources I can no longer download to the eBook.So while the REB1100 is a GREAT product, be aware of the possible problems with upgrading."
1,Customer support,"THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR THIS PRODUCT. It is not shown on the RCA website, the phone numbers in the owners manual have been changed or aren'tactive anymore. We were told that the company had been sold!Again, THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT AVAILABLE FOR THIS PRODUCT!"
3,Well Worth Looking At,"Got a good deal when I bought it. I bought it as a refurbished ebook. I wish I had known that it had been upgraded to the REB1150. It complicated things because it will only take ebooks with the imp extension. Still researching to see if a can revert to the 1100 program. But all in all it is a pretty good reader. If you purchase it with the original program, do not upgrade it (don't know if that is even optional as the original website doesn't exist anymore). There are programs out there that will convert your current files to the imp extension, but it would have been easier if it was still in the rb format."
2,This product works OK but....,"The RCA REB 1100 ebook is terrific idea in search of even average execution. It works reasonably well (I have to reset mine every 3-4 days), but the real problems lie in two areas: lack of titles available, and customer service. Even though three outlets sell ebook formatted books, they all sell the same titles. Authors such as Dean Koontz, John Grisham, J.R.R. Tolkien,(to name a very few) are completely unavailable. Other popular authors (at least to me) like Michael Connolly or Ken Follet are available in extremely limited selections. Also, the pricing on available books does not always reflect the fact that they may currently be purchased in paperback-and are priced much higher than a typical paperback. As far as customer service is concerned, don't ever lose an accessory-because short of breaking the unit and returning it on an extended warranty, there's no way to replace it..."
4,Do not believe the hype,"To address a previous poster's concerns - they are baseless - this unit works fine with HTML, TXT and other formats.First off, there's the issue with software. Here are links to websites that provide software that will create rocketbook documents[...]The Rocketwriter will convert html documents and text files to the rocketbook format. The Publisher is a more advanced tool, allowing for font selection, etc. The final link is for open source software that can grab webpages for the device.So I have no idea where the previous poster got their ideas from.About the product:Its lightweight, the batteries last a very long between charges, despite 8mb of internal memory, many many ebooks can be stored.It is totally possible to use available tools to convert PDF's, word documents and LIT files for use with this device. Just google it."
1,Very BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"The first one I purchased continuously restarted when trying to register. I exchanged this one and the next one just flat out stopped working after registering (within a couple hours of bringing it home and charging it). Needless to say, my experience was not a good one. I really think the technology has a chance and will benefit the marketplace, but it needs much more work and better compatibility with other file types. I think I'll be looking at the PDA devices with MS Reader instead. I REALLY WISH THIS DEVICE WOULD HAVE WORKED FOR ME. If you get one, I hope your experience is better than mine."
3,Warning before you buy,"No complaints on the performance of the Sony SAVAD900 Home Theater System by Sony, which I believe is their top of the line DVD/CD surround system, EXCEPT that this model does NOT play CDRs! I made the mistake of checking the lower priced model which apparently does play cdrs, but was talked into getting this one by my girlfriend because of the relatively weak subwoofer on the lower models. I cannot believe that for $1,000.00 this thing cannot play cdrs. I think it is because on this model, the dvds/cd player is housed in the speaker, as opposed to the lower models wherein there is a separate unit. SO IF YOU INTEND TO PLAYS CDRS IN YOUR HOME THEATER SYSTEM BUY A LOWER MODEL OR GET A BOSE OR A PIONEER UNIT."
4,Good product,"My house came with RG-59 cables, when patching the antenna in my roof to those cables I lost a couple stations. Upon getting this cable I regained one of those channels (not both) but I also got a new one that I didn't even know existed. Considering it's a 100-foot run I am happy with this product. As you know with digital it's all or nothing and we have a large tree line to contend with."
1,Not for Satellite,"I bought this wire to run my satellite into a bedroom and to make a long story short, it would not carry a signal. This was clearly not suitable for this job. I did not return it, as I got angry and cut it in two and replaced it with a cable that had to be at least 15 years old. The old cable worked perfectly. Look for a better cable than this to run satellite, as this does not work at all."
3,Does the job,"just as the title stated - does the job. Unfortunately, I wasn't watching what I was clicking on and thought I had purchased a quad-shielded RG-6 coax. It wasn't but even though I'd preferred the 'upgrade' this'll do. totally operator error."
3,Returning this item - NOT direct bury cable,"As I understand it, direct bury and/or flooded coax will be market as such on the cable itself. This cable came up when I searched on direct bury, but do note that it is simply indoor/outdoor, and seems no different from the other Philips cable that I have purchased separately here at Amazon. Not sure why it is difficult to find the actual flooded or direct bury type, but if that's what you need, do keep looking. Giving it a 3 star rating simply because it looks like good quality coax, it's just not the kind I thought I was getting."
4,"Good cable, but a bit expensive",I ordered this cable since I was in a bind and needed it fast. It's of good quality but bulk quad shield RG-6 is cheaper. The my satellite signal was between 94 and 100% with two 50 foot runs of this cable joined with a union.
1,Horrible Ska album,It is hard to imagine that such a terrible ska band could have evolved into the amazing band that is known as los Fabulosos Cadillacs. There is not a single song on this album that stands out as remotely impressive. please do not waste your time and money with this album as i did. if you want to start out with something to familiarize yourself with GOOF LFB music...i suggest you start out with either El Leon or Vascos Vacios. DO NOT waste your money with this album. You've been warned!
2,Not what I expected or wanted.,"I guess I was expecting Simak style science fiction. Meaning quiet, low key, rural, spiritual, pacifist, & even unabashedly sentimental. A story of a colony of Quakers being ""discovered"" set me up for that. Lesbian-feminist aspects & a sort of angriness underneath ruined that. Also the author gave a ""kill all the men"" philosophy more credence then it deserved. Why does it have to be women in charge or men in charge can't we be equal, while respecting the differences? I think the book's message is egalitarian, but she argued ""Women good, Men worthless"" better. The Quaker stuff was good, although she has some style problems. I hate to trash a book someone else loved, so I'll stop there. Except to say I probably had wrong expectations & maybe I'd ""get it"" if I were a woman. (Although I like books to be a little more universal than that)"
5,Jury Still Out,I bought this hard drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She is in college and has a Dell Computer and needed more HD space. I read many reviews and I also saw that Dell sells this model as well. She has not hooked it up yet so the jury is still out on the performance. I will advise later on that issue. The delivery was on time and no other problems are noted this time.
2,firewire connection stopped working in 2 weeks.,"The firewire connection stopped working in 2 weeks. The usb connection is still working (another week later), but I don't have a lot of faith in this as a backup drive."
4,"Great for Macs, Good customer support","I'm using this hard drive with Mac OS X Tiger and it works great, even without the fancy backup software included with OS X Leopard. The drive looks really neat when it is on and glowing, but it can get kind of annoying in the dark, when I am trying to sleep. But other than that this drive is great, I like the simple nature of the software intended for use with it however I had some trouble getting started because the software always crashed when I tried to open it. But after an email to Seagate's tech support I got a fresh download that worked perfectly."
2,Disappointing,"Much anticipated after Chase's very engrossing Heart of Deception. Unfortunately, this one simply did not live up to expectations. I found the efforts to tie this book in with the last distracting and forced; Claire and Adrian never become fully realized characters and honestly were rather boring; Nigel and Sir Reginald were caricatures and it was difficult to care what happened to any of them. I found myself stuggling to slog through to the end (actually, I haven't been able to bring myself to finish it yet). Chase is at her best when she portrays strong, dark characters and when there's a bit more of a spark between her lovers (not to mention more tension or love scenes!)."
3,A very brief bio...,"I picked this book up at a competing brick and mortar book store. I did so mainly to learn why CNN had been dethroned by FoxNews, and also because I had an interest in the man credited with the invention of 24-hour news.Overall, the book was satisfying. Turner's life is covered rather well, but the details are missing. Every chapter seems more of a summary of something larger than a fact-filled chapter that it is intended to be. Then again, I wasn't expecting a thorough biography given its scant 180 pages.Regardless, this book will give you a good idea of the man that is Turner. Why did he strive for greatness? Why did he create CNN? How and why did he lose CNN and his fortune? Why is his heart set on world peace? These questions - and others - are neatly answered."
1,Never received the book!!,I have not received this book. I made the trip to Los Angeles already. This is the first time I've been taken.
5,Great guide,I took this guide book with me on my first visit to LA recently. I was interested in doing all of the typical tourist things. This book was indispensable. I also bought Frommer's guide book and I never opened it.I rented a car and traveled through LA. I was driving alone and the maps in this book were a huge help. They are very detailed and held up through being thrown in the car and in and out of bags. The pictures are great. The decriptions are short and to the point. I also loved the size of this book. It is small enough to easily carry in a larger purse or backpack.I didn't use the Top 10 book to plan my trip - only what to do and where to go when I got there. A more detailed book might serve you better if you need help decided where to stay and what hotels to use.You can't go wrong with this guide book - it is really the only guidebook you need for LA.
4,"Nice introduction to the world of ""slo-core""","I just started listening to Low, and wish I had heard of them sooner. Some people call the music depressing or cold, while others find it pensive or minimalist. I think they reach a nice balance, where this is something you can listen to, strike a mood, and just kick back. If your looking for something more gloomy, check out titles that are closer to Goth (see Lycia), where upbeat stuff would be something like Red House Painters. Anyways, really great stuff here. Check it out, you might like it. :)"
5,Low's Apex,"No less haunting and melancholic than Low's previous albums, yet much fuller in orchestration. More strings, more percussion, and a little more musical variation to complement the bloody-bath-water duo--this album gets more addictive with each playing. Along with Secret Name, Things We Lost in the Fire represents the best of Low."
4,Elegant Drones and Haunting Spaces,"It's been a while since Low's seventh CD Things We Lost in the Fire was released, but music this deliberate takes a long time to process! The question with ""slowcore"" is always - do the songs warrant the effort? In the case of Things We Lost in the Fire, the answer is a resounding `yes'. From the majestic opening ""Sunflower"" to the it-nearly-has-a-pulse-and-a-chorus ""Dinosaur Act"" to the poignant abortion elegy ""In Metal"", Alan Sparhark (vocals/guitars) and Mimi Parker (vocals/drums) sustain their elegant drones and haunting spaces, with just enough variation and coloration to keep interest. The songs are not only melancholy, but grisly - terminal illness, (""Medicine Magazines""), murder (""Embrace""), and lots of death, both real and metaphoric (pick a track). They leave no stone unturned, and seem to thrill by exposing the insects to the light."
2,I tried to like this but...,"I just couldn't find anything that held my interest. I read so many good things about this band and this album, so I must say, I'm really let down. This is a dull, un-inspired, underproduced album that belongs in the bargin bin at your local music store. What a bore."
2,Too much and too little,The plot concept was strong but I became lost in rhetoric and description. The author enjoys certain liberties for decscriptions that hurt the overall imagery of the piece. Overall I found it to not be a waste of time but caused my time to be wasted in excessive wordings.
5,1/3 the price of any anywhere else I've shopped.,"I love the old cordless 900mhz DSS phone this battery fits but they only last about 1.5 years, are hard to find and expensive when you can find them.I've purchased this batter at Staples (the only place I could find it) and it costs about $18. I've also made one out of 3 Nicad AA's, but the flat contacts that this uses makes it really hard to wire up.After buying about 2 new replacements, and making one, I quit replacing the battery - as the replacement price was so near the price of a new cordless phone.Finding a brand name replacement ""Lenmar"" (who makes many different rechargeable batteries including those for camcorders and cell phones - both of which I've used and out-performed the manufacturers batteries.) at a price 1/3 of the lowest price I've been able to find before, let's me pull out my old long-range phone and enjoy and use it once more."
4,Excellent book!,"Business Ethics is one of those topics that is always interesting. This books definitely brings out all of those topics; it kept me yearning for more. The topics are easy to understand, the writer did an exceptional job in writing. I would recommend this book 100%."
2,Edition,This was not the latest edition of the book which caused issues when doing assigned readings and homework. Not very happy.
4,"Satisfied overall, small complaint","The textbook arrived quickly and it was what I had ordered, though it had some minor ink smudges on a few pages here and there."
2,eh....,Very flimsy gauge of copper not much thicker than aluminum foil. Might be good for some applications but not for mine.
1,What can you say?!,"Well, I bought one of these units and it quite mysteriously stopped working for good, after about 2 weeks. Because I live overseas (in a developing economy) I have little chance of getting it repaired. But that said, I probably will buy another one because it is just so nice to have....."
2,Would've been great if it worked!!!,"This MiniDisc recorder was excellent until it suddenly stopped working. The LCD display failed right at the end of the *ONLY THREE MONTH WARRANTY PERIOD* (Sony offers only 3 months labour and 1 year parts coverage).After a long and frustrating battle with customer service, Sony refused to cover it and charged me [money] to get it fixed!! This is not the first time I have had problems with Sony products and repair services. I fail to see why a company that can spend millions of dollars on marketing their products is unable to stand behind them!!"
1,MZ-G750DPC - sad and disappointed,"I saved up 300 bucks to buy this MD but it wasn't worth it. After a few months the jog (tuner) dial on the remote broke off (cheap parts), and if playing an MD, i can't hear the sound unless I hold down the piece connecting the remote to the unit. Initially I believed the problem was the headphones or remote but after trying several pairs i realize the problem must be with the unit. Not to mention the radio reception is terribly poor. I have a cheap... no name radio in the car and i get better reception. Another problem is when I push the FM button on the remote to start the radio, it either shuts off in 2 seconds, or it never turns on at all, remaining frozen with the flashing dashes on the display, even if I have the hold button on (both remote and unit)! I am ultra disappointed. I never even dropped the unit once. I guess Sony is cutting back."
4,Live vs the CD,"Caught them on the last Indy show as well as this one. On the 8/18/2000 show, the sound guys were working for the cd, not the live audience, thus the muddy quality of Eddie's voice live vs the good quality found on the cd. Fantastic gig nonetheless and an even better memory of it digitized."
3,Understands birders,"A pleasant, quick read. Ms. Goff does understand birders, a quirky sort of group."
2,Only if you really love birds,"This is way too ""birdy"" for me. I don't mind birds, but this was way too much and too in depth. If you adore birds and learning about them, then you will probably like this book. Otherwise, you will be overwhelmed with the world of the US Fish and Game agent. Angela, the main character, isn't too annoying, just that most of the rest of the characters are and the situation is a frustrating one. Not a series that I will read any more of."
2,too thick for my car,"I have been looking for good lumbar support, but this is a too thick and tall for a Toyota Corolla"
2,No strap to hold in place,"I bought this to help releave back pain while I'm sitting in my office chair at work. When I received it I immediately noticed that there was no strap to hold it in place in the chair, so it would constantly fall into the seat every time I got up. Plus, it didn't seem like it would be all that comfortable, although hard to tell with the packaging still in place. I sent it back and got a different type which I think will work well."
3,made for tall people,"Im five nine so the reach of the pad comes past my mid back. So I am thinking this was meant for those six feet up. Now dont get me wrong it does work, it is just that you feel where the thing ends and it just bugs me. After awhile you dont think about it too much but once you move around you have to re adjust it to where it works again. You could do the exact same thing with some nice folded bath towels and save thirty bucks more than likely. The towels would be more pliable and able to be aranged better. I have used this method before and was just looking for a more elegant solution. If you could cut the thing off it would be great, but you cant. Tried in sports cars and suv, all same story."
1,Back-Huggar cushion very hard,"I ordered this cushion to use in our van because the seats hurt my back and have no lumbar adjustment. The Back-Huggar is a very hard cushion and even though it says THIN style, it still shoved my back too far forward to be comfortable. It is so hard that is doesn't conform at all to a person's body. I sent it back - just didn't work for me. Amazon was great about allowing me to return the item."
3,Ok,This is better than the cheap ones at the store. It fits nicely on the seat. Nothing beats built in lumbar supports.
1,Well made but ....,Maybe it's just me but this back huggar (thin) is not . (Thin}It pushes my back in an uncomfortable position in relation to the shoulders and upper back no matter how it is positioned .This is in my car so perhaps it works well on a sofa or very soft chair .
4,Good but a bit thin,"Good if you don't want as much lumbar support. But it's less than I would like. I got this because Back-Huggar describes the thin style as ""most popular bucket seat style"". However, it's much more beveled than necessary for my Honda Accord. Indeed, the standard, non-beveled Back-Huggar fits between the side bolsters of my bucket seat. In retrospect, perhaps Back-Huggar's description was referring not to fitting the most common bucket seat styles, but rather that this style is the most frequently purchased among their two bucket seat styles.Still, it's definitely better than nothing in the car.Before buying a Back-Huggar for your car seat, measure the space between the seat's side bolsters. The thin Back-Huggar is 7"" between the bevels at its narrowest. The standard is 14""."
1,Back-Huggar,"I tried this product for a reasonable length of time, but I found that it really didn't give me all thatmuch relief!"
4,I like it,"I bought this for my wife. She had tried several similar products, but could not find one that she liked. She likes this one. That means that I like it too."
3,Works but not perfect,"I have a butterfly chair where the cushion is suspended on 4 spokes that offers no back support, this cushion works great on this chair. This was a substantial upgrade from the pillow I was using.I tried using this cushion on a office chair the has some back support but not as much lumbar support as deserved and found the cushion to not be useful at all. Even being the thin line this cushion was substantially too thick to use on my desk chair.Overall rating: 3.5 starsAs a side note, I also bought this cushion for use while driving on long car trips however I still have not tested the utility of this as I've not traveled since purchasing it."
2,Not the best - Careful with Seller return policy,"I bought two of theseBack-Huggar The Original Lumbar Cushion, Bucket Seat THIN Style, Blue Thin BucketseatBodyline Back Huggar, The Original Lumbar Cushion, Regular Seat (13"" x 14""), BlackThe original one is very good. My wife had backache and this one was very helpful.The bucket seat thin style is not so great. It was not useful in a car seat as advertised. Careful about the seller return policy. You have only 5 days to return it but by the time you decide it is not good it would be more than 5 days."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a fantasic book, my kids loved it. The old man is warm and cuddly and the flea is cute. The illustrations are really good - large, bright and colorful."
1,not what it portraid as,This movie is less than one star when they do speak it baby talk. Its the wost movie picture qualty is poor
2,Weak story line,"I like ALL fantasy books, I've read tens of them, but this one...I haven't finished it.At a certain point I realized that the story did not appeal to me anymore, and I was not curious to know how it would end. So I put the book down (a year ago) and I haven't yet taken it up.Well, I think that the story's weakness is the most serious fault in a fantasy book.David Eddings' characters are one-dimensional and stereotyped, but at least his story has a grip on you.Better if you choose something else by Lynn Flewelling, Robert Jordan, George Martin, Ann Bishop, C.S. Friedman, Terry Brooks..."
2,One person's opinion: YUCK.,"I found the book overwhelmed by forced creativity, political correctness and author intrusion. At best her characters bored me and at worst they offended me. Ms. Patton appears to be a competent enough writer but her tale is clearly intended for a different audience other than me. My recommendation is if you're tempted to pick up this book read LeGuinn's The Left Hand of Darkness instead."
2,Fantasy Fiction or a Politcally correct Romance novel?,"Personally I gave this book 100 pages to pick up, but instead I just got tired of the romance between the male lead character and his male friend. I have read books in the past that had gay characters and that is fine, however this book is centered around the relationship and is quite boring."
3,The Fantasy Version of Henry IV Play,"As I read this book something kept nagging at my brain, why was this story SO familiar? Not until a few days later it hit me! This story is nothing but a re-telling of the Henry V story! With Prince Demaron being Henry. His lover being a combination of Falstaff and Muron. Mellessandra, Demaron's mother, being the female version of Henry IV who despises her son for his weakness;in favour of the second child. Just like Henry IV did. There's a mix of the usual fantasy stuff (magic, monsters). But the story is undeniably the story of King Hal or Henry V of England. If you aren't familiar with the history or the Shakesperean play (Henry IV) you might enjoy this book. But if you have you may be sorely put off by the authors total un-originality. If you are looking for a good book on the life of Henry V. Pick up ""Good King Harry""."
4,Great twist on classic fantasy characters,"Although the exclusion of gender specific titles can be a bit confusing at first, this is a book worth sticking with. Open your mind, buy this book, read it, and love it"
5,I very much enjoyed this book..,"I liked this book mainly for the two protaganist in the story..Prince Demnor nad Kel...I really wanted more from Kel'z character, for instinct..Can't the author give him another guy to make the Prince Jealous and i really don't take to girl the prince married..I wish there was another book to continue from this one...Overall, really like the book, reason why i gave it 5 stars..I had it for awhile now but never did a review here but am doing so now...I find myself re-reading it at times.."
3,Not captivating,"This book really didn't captivate me. I found myself not really caring that much for the characters and having to skip through some of the overly long battle scenes.There's not much fantasy in this one, just kings and dukes and earls, lots of fighting, a little bit of court intrigue.There's very little feeling in the characters--they go out and kill dragons or each other, no real remorse over death, but then have a big party.What is unique and interesting about this book that I've never seen before and applaud is the gender and sexual equality. There are not princesses or duchesses, everyone is prince, early, duke, etc. regardless of gender. Positions of power, inheritance are all first born, and same-sex relationships are common. Marriage isn't much more than a political contract to produce heirs. In this respect it differs from any other Medieval-sword-and-castle type of fantasy I've ever read."
4,The narrative isn't linear,"I read this good book, here in Brazil.This book is concise and easy to read.It wasn't made for doctors, but for general public.I'm not a doctor.I'm an agronomist.Some photos; all black and white.The main failure of this book is to be non-linear.A chapter about tuberculosis today, is before a chapter about the discovery of bacterial origin of tuberculosis.Among the best parts of this book, there's the proof that tuberculosis declined before medicines against it, were found in late 1940 decade.Better sanitarization, better food, pasteurization,etc. put tuberculosis in decline, since late XVIII Century."
5,works as promised,not much to say. works as promised and a good value. Replaced the battery that died in my cordless phone with this and it works great.
3,"another ""boy group""?","I was not impressed by this album. Profyle, Next, Liberty City, No Question....all the same to me. The beats as well as the voices are pretty much replaceable. Don't get me wrong - I am not trying to be a hater! I don't think this a bad album - I just would like to see (or better: hear) a litte more uniqueness."
2,The connectors are weak,"The connectors at each end are made of cheap material and do not have a large flat, hex surface from which to place your fingers and twist. I have other cables that have a hex connector with a flat surface about 3/8 of an inch that are easy to turn. The cable works however, just difficult to twist on / off which I have done several times because of various reasons."
5,Great Buy and high quality cable,"I got this cable to run from a new RCA antenna to my outdoor Preamplifier. The cable was to be outside and wrapped around a metal pole that had other cables wrapped around it. This cable was perfect, it was a great price, it was shielded so it did not cause nor receive any interference from my cable runs (I have multiple antennas running into one source), it has a solid feeling connector, that is easy to turn and work with and does not feel cheap, and it has a nice size copper cable running through it! I have had no problem and the 25 feet was more than enough for my installation, it was easy to working with and is easy enough to move (although it is stiff, which is good) and I was able to wrap it around a pole with no problem.I am very happy with this cable, it was a great buy and works perfectly outside on my antenna, it has a nice connector and feels secure, I will definitely be getting more of these when I need more cable!"
5,Great cable with O-rings,"I bought this cable specifically for outdoor use to hook up a small antenna. It is dual-shielded and has O-rings in the compression fittings which are firmly attached. Tough outer covering but still flexible. Once uncoiled it did not retain the coiled shape; laid out flat nicely. Excellent through-put, out-performed RG6 cable from previous Comcast Cable installation. If I ever need dual-shielded cable for outdoor use, I will not hesitate to buy this brand again. Very pleased with high quality and performance."
3,Good book for graduate students and college students,"RELEARN how to learn how to study for classesand or any type of material.I really enjoyed the metaphors, models and mentors who were interviewed for this book.Another strategy filled book to help college students, or graduate students like myselflearn in a whole new way with neuro linguistic programmming.A book endorsed by Richard Bandler, founder of NLP.One may imagine learning how to re-learnand run your massive brain for change! Now.."
2,Sony Disappoints,"Our past experience with Sony products has been great, but this receiver is a disappointment. We have integrated the receiver with a DVD/CD player, a Dish Satellite TV receiver, a VCR, and a tape deck. Installation instructions are good, but operational instructions are a problem.1) The manual is written for an audio engineer, not a consumer. The many control settings are barely explained.2) CD sound is biased toward high treble, and Sony recommends an external equalizer as the only answer.3) Technical support is by email only with slow responses and incomplete answers.We will not buy another Sony audio product."
4,Continuing with Japanese,"This book is a continuation to Youkoso an Invitation to Contemporary Japanese, and definately is more difficult than the first book. In this book there is less use of furigana, and in fact with Kanji taught in the first book there is no furigana given. The book begins with an overview of what was taught in the Introduction to Contemporary Japanese, then gets into things in the same manner as the first book. All chapters begin with an overview of the vocabulary that will be needed in the chapter, then goes into a few practice exercises before going into dialogues. These books are as dialogue heavy as they are vocabulary heavy. I have used both these textbooks as well as the Japanese for Busy People, and another text called Minna No Nihongo, and find the Youkoso books to be far more intensive."
5,Great Book!,The Yookoso Textbooks are very good for the beginners of learning the Japanese Language. Its easier to understand the difficult concepts and conjugations of the Japanese language. It made it quite easy for me to learn the Japanese language. This and the rest of the Yookoso series of books is great for the person who really want to learn and understand the Japanese language and culture.
3,This was my first pearl jam show.,"This was my first pj show so of course i was excited, but the show is not great it was fun bein there but it did lack some energy. Eddie was in a great mood and talked about how much he loves atlanta, whether its true or not i dont know but i had a great time and its still not my favorite pj show ive been too so make up your own mind on this one... PS the only reason i own it is because i was there!"
2,Size is way off,I like the t-shirt but the size chart is not correct. I had to give this away to someone because it was way too small for me....I would say it was more a L instead of 3X
3,plus horse,Looks great. Feels great. BUT does not help if child not interested in playing with it. Must be for younger (under 2) children.
2,Lame 80's style,"I really wasn't very impressed. To me, most of the images weren't very erotic and the people depicted didn't really seem that interested in each other. There's a lot of nice background detail and some okay female breasts and torsos here, but very little for admirers of the male form or admirers of pure romance. And what the heck was with the pool-hall scene? Not erotic. Just cheezy."
1,Does not work!,Signal strength to my dish receiver was 62 on the 110 satellite.Installed terk bia-20. Signal came in at 62. No change!
1,Extremely disappointed,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I have Directv with HD (5 LNB) and the signal was low. Signal was less than 60% for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching HD. So I bought these to amplify my satellite signal. They actually attenuated the signal. The signal strength wasn't improved on the non HD receivers that I have as well. It didn't matter where I put them in relation to the dish and receiver.
1,"Hurts, Not Helps, Signal","I have 7 HD channels, and one of them is not coming in well (off-air antenna). I bought this device hoping that would help that one channel. It did not. Instead, it killed all of the channels except one! It actually hurt my reception. My HD receiver rates my ABC channel at ""90"", but with this amp inline, it is between ""40"" and ""50"", and simply won't tune in most of the time. The same can be said of my other channels. I am going to see if I can return it after writing this review. The description of this amp says it is for satellite, off-air and FM. I don't know if it helps satellite or FM, but it sure does not help HD off-air."
1,Doesn't appear to do anything,"I installed this amplifier for a Dish Network setup. Some of the channels are showing 30%, others 60%. After installing this amplifier, the numbers are exactly the same. Since it doesn't come with a manual of any kind, and since their website offers absolutely no advice - should it be connected closer to the dish or closer to the receiver? In the middle? Does it matter? I have no way of knowing whether or not this problem is the amplifier or the setup. Buyer beware - it may do absolutely nothing at all."
2,More Information Would be Helpful...,"I'm sure that this is a fine amplifier under the right conditions, but there is little documentation provided which explains which kinds of equipment/situations are best for this product. Signal amplification is a complicated topic, but this amplifier didn't help reception of my satellite, or over the air tv signals in an urban area. Eventually I gave up trying to figure this thing out - better documentation would be much appreciated."
2,Intermittent CD Player,"I have returned this unit twice to no avail. It has an irritating flaw of not recognizing/not loading a CD and skipping its place in the tray. Sometimes it plays all five CDs, sometimes only one. Not what I expected from Sony."
4,Well pleased,I found this CD Changer to be easy to operate and it to have good sound -everything I had expected.
5,"Dollar-for-Dollar, a Top Buy","I purchased this Sony product to replace my slowly failing Technics 5-disk carousel CD player purchased more than 20 years ago. Although I lack the technical sophistication to give a detailed appraisal, I can say that it more than meets my expectations relative to sound quality and ease of operation--especially, given its very low price at Vann's, which even included free shipping. The only thing I miss--and this isn't all that important--is being able to turn the unit on and off with the remote (as I could do with the Technics CD player). Dollar-for-dollar, then, this is one the wisest purchases I have ever made in the area of entertainment."
1,Garbage,"I bought this junk, not from Amazon. It plays what it wants, it is clunky, like something from a nightmare called 8 track players, what is wrong with Sony? I recall when you could put a vinyl record on a turntable, you got instant music. I recall that even 8 track players gave instant music, so did cassette decks. This thing is garbage, it doesn't work, it will play about 20 songs, then just sit there. Don't buy this, it's junk."
4,great cd player,"This is a great cd player. we use it all the time. everyday in fact, the 5 disc is just enough.we have a sony stereo system, the 1st cd player(came with stereo) crapped out about 4 yrs ago. Afriend gave us her sony cd player I have no idea how old it was. we used it for 4 yrs. was veryhappy to find this one. looked online at sony, they have nothing. it is rather hard to find the 5disc carousel. was so happy with amazon. easy to use and worked with my remote for the system."
4,SONY 5-CD CHANGER,"Our new Sony CDP-CE375 changer produces great music. However, I'm disappointed in the noise it makes, while shuffling or selecting the next CD. Our older Sony CDP-CE365 changer is quieter, and also has better-designed front controls. I would say that this new one, compared to old, is no improvement."
4,Great sound,"We replaced an old single CD player with this new Sony 5 CD player. When we loaded some music and turned it on, the improved sound was great. We didn't know what we had been missing. Great value for us."
5,Sony Player,"The player arrived quickly was sealed, new and so easy to hook up. Plays great without any problems. I will definitely order again. Thanks!"
5,quality,if you want a nice piece of equipment to just play a couple of cd's then this is the product for you without a doubt. if you play poker you just got a royal fluch in spades for a great bet. cannot recommend this sony high enough.
4,"Very Pleased So Far, Great Sony Product","Wow, I'm (so far!) not having the problems other consumers had, posted below ~ just purchased this Sony DVD 5 disc player today, was quite easy to hook up, and is working just great, no problems with the random all discs feature at all. Not sure totally just yet about the sound quality,since I'm still working on getting a proper speaker set up going for our home theater system, but will say it's sounding very clear and crisp, which is a plus for me...do like the exchange feature as well (can add CD while still playing), just wish the buttons were a little bigger and easier to see on the front (to access the exchange feature and skip CD feature). So far I would recommend it for the price ~ will post an update later once I've tested every feature."
1,Look No Further Than the Remote,"I tried to install one of these for a friend with a Technics Receiver, and the thing just did not work. Customer support claimed that I needed an optical cable, and that actually did worst. I am not sure if the unit was bad or if there is a compatibility issue, but what I do know is that THERE IS NO POWER BUTTON ON THE REMOTE. We could not understand that, how inconvenient. I am sure you would be better served buying a DVD/CD changer for a similar price. Atleast that was the advice I gave my friend.UPDATE: The problem was the receiver, so the cd player may actually be OK. I am still quite disappointed with the remote. From looking at the other reviews, I would still pass it by, and I am still leaving it at 1 star due to the remote."
1,Sony CDP-CE375 5-CD Changer - The CD Fumbler,UnitSony CDP-CE375 5-CD ChangerI received had a nasty habit of missing the correct slot when dropping discs as part of a disc change cycle. No way to predict when it would happen; would perform several cycles OK and then jam. Unusable. Had to take the cover off to retrieve the mis-positioned disc.
2,Carousel cd changer,Dont buy it there's no remote and no instructions your wasting your money it's not it it's a total ripoff
2,It worked well for awhile then sound cut off-had to use subtitles.,I don't know if anyone else had this problem but after a moderate use of item the sound stopped and I had to use subtitles. I tried every button and menu on the remote to bring back the sound. So far nothing worked. I don't know who can fix this but it was already expensive when I bought it about 3-4 years ago and used it maybe 2-3 times a year (total @ 12 times). The remote had some damage from overflowing batteries but I cleaned it up and the remote seems to be working OK. I bought it from Amazon.com and it did work well for awhile.
2,Good thing the price was cheap,"I got this the other day from Amazon, it was one of their re boxed units for $39.99. Luckily I didn't pay more for this. I trust Sony so hopefully it will last for awhile. The description said minor damage to packing box...this unit is warped/bowed on the top. I am using this in a garage so I will just keep it as there are no more $39.99 ones left. Sure wish Amazon would have been truthful with their description. I did try playing one CD and it worked fine. Hopefully it will last for awhile."
5,"Great sound, great price","I bought this changer in lieu of purchasing a new Bose system, as I had an older Bose radio (which I love). Sony products have always been great and this changer is no exception. I would highly recommend it. The only thing I can say is that it is larger in size than I anticipated."
1,Fataly flawed out of the box,DOA played on 20sec of CD before player recycled to start of CD. Sony has dropped a lot from previous esteem.
2,Subpar at best.,If youre looking for a great 5 cd changer I highly recommend Optimus's.Ive had it since 2002 and it still works fine.Ive had to clean it a few times but overall I was very impressed.This one by Sony was possesed after 4 months.I was highly disappointed.Is Optimus more reliable?I think so but Sony still makes some kick ass speakers.
4,Best Price Around,"Shopped all the local stores for a multi-disc cd player and found this Sony on Amazon for $35 less, including shipping. Item arrived 2 days after order. Talk about service! Works and sounds great!"
2,Barely used and already broken...,"Very disappointed in this player. Not only does the shuffle all discs take forever to load the next track, but after three years it now won't play reliably. Might just stick to Sony tv's from now on."
2,disappointed,the player came w/o a remote so I have to manually operate the thing. other than that it works fine
2,Disappointed in Sony,Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all. I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer. Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while. It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD. Apparently Sony didn't do proper quality testing on this product. I returned mine and after these other reviews won't be replacing it with a Sony. I hope this is a message to Sony.
5,great buy,"I was a bit hesitant to buy this after reading some of the reviews, but we have been very happy with our purchase. All is working as promised!"
1,"Like others have said, a unit with major problems","This unit work well for a very short period of time. Nothing extraordinary but it worked and sounded ok. Then it stop reading discs and will cycle through all 5 and display ""no disc""Very disappointed in this cd player."
2,DOA,unit was DOA ... waiting for an RA to return unit ... so far experience has been good with customer service ... packaging was good and quick delivery
1,Horrible!,I received this as a birthday gift and therefore did not get the chance to read the reviews. WHat a horrible unit! My Ned's Atomic Dustbin CD actually jammed up the unit two times! The first time I thought it was a fluke. The 2nd time I had to take the cover off and the CD was lying off of the carousel in the bottom of the unit. This thing is crap and it's going back tomorrow to Best Buy.I'm very disappointed with Sony as my last Sony 5 disc player lasted 15 years without any problems!
2,"Works for a while, then gives up","This player actually played my CDs very nicely at first. I teach music in a school, so I needed the ability to load several CDs in the player, and switch them around often. I was disappointed that just a few days ago, less than a month after I've been using it, it started saying ""no disc"" on the very same CDs that it WAS playing a week or two ago. Nothing changed on the discs, it just refuses to play them. I'm returning this for a better machine."
1,defective out of the box,"Started skipping before the first piece was half over. Isn't there a good changer out there somewhere?Also, had it playing through the AUX of a single play Denon book shelf system. Sound was notably degraded from a CD played directly though the Denon. Fuzzy."
3,cd changer review,"I purchased this to replace a similar Sony CD changer that worked for 18 years. This unit doesn't feel quite as well built as the previous unit. Also, it doesn't have a disc advance, so I have to manually rotate the carousel to load CDs. Also, it doesn't recognize CDs burned on Windows Media Player (the same CDs work just fine in my auto and in my portable player). That's a negative. Sound quality is OK because I feed the output to my stereo amplifier."
2,Defective remote system,"Despite many reviews not favorable, I purchased this unit to replace a similar Sony unit I purchased in 1992 that had quit working. I was satisfied for the first few uses but after several weeks the remote quit working. I replaced the factory provided batteries to no avail. This is a new problem not mentioned in other reviews. I will not replace this with a Sony. Their quality level seems to be decreasing lately. I had similar problems with a Sony TV and replaced it with a better, cheaper Samsung LCD. John H."
2,faulty merchandise,I hooked up my new Sony CDP-CD375 5-CD changer only to find out that the tray had a mind of it's own. After loading the first CD the tray kept retracting and ejecting without stopping all on it's own. Sony had me ship it back to their repair center in Texas and did replace the CD changer with one that worked but I was stuck with the postage. I wish someone would test their products before sending them out. I should receive a check from Sony or Amazon for the hours and expense I incurred dealing with faulty merchandise.MJ
4,It does what we want and is good for us.,We are really satisfied with the cd player as it is what connects to our system and does the job well.
4,Very Good,This Sony unit is very easy to operate and the controls and functions work well from CD exchange to the other.
5,CD CHANGER,"I bought this same item used from someone on Ebay and it took 3 weeks to get it and it was in horrible condition and would not play a CD. So, I got smart and ordered a new one from Amazon which arrived in 3 days and I can play all my music again. Thanks, Amazon!"
1,Very bad choice!,I paid way too much for this item. The price dropped on line by over $30.00 right after I found the dented box at my doorstep two days after I ordered it. Then I hooked it up and found that it could not play DVD's too. I put in 5 music CD's and half way through the first CD and second song it made a weird thumping noise and was spinning out of control. I removed the 5 CD's unplugged the thing and put it back in it's box. I still have not heard from the company 'Video & Audio' Center about what they will do.What about you Amazon? How do you protect your customers?
1,Extremely poor customer service,Phone Numbers included for help from Sony were not operative nor were the numbers given to me by Amazon customer service could not reach them directions included were very vague and not helpful at all finally gave up and returned product to Amazon
3,They work but...,These petals do cover well but the silicone isn't breathable. I find that if I wear them during any physical activity they get really sweaty and are kind of gross when you take them off.
1,product is not as advertised,I did not like this product. It is not worth buying. I would not shop here again. The material is not recommended.
4,Great Energy and French Style,"I first heard this group floating down the Seine River on a barge. Their music is a strong happy combination of rock, ballad and salsa. Voila L'ete is a sweet 1960s style ballad that laments about Spring time. Other songs are wild exuberant celebrations. This is a fun CD with energy."
3,"Cute, but doesn't do enough","My son got the Clubhouse and all the figures for his birthday. He loves them but considering it cost about $90 to get everything to make a complete Mickey Mouse Clubhouse set, this toy does not do enough to keep a child entertained. I feel bad for making my mother spend the money on this as a gift to her grandson."
1,An absolute waste of money,The animated figures were actually more expensive than the Mickey Mouse Clubshouse itself and they don't work right. I regret ever buying this for my daughter. It has no educational value whatsoever. It's very disappointing for a Disney toy. You'd expect better quality.
1,extinct device,I own the REB 1200. The Gemstar ebook sites are no longer operating and it seems one can no longer buy content for the device. Shouldn't Amazon consider providing the disclaimer regarding the device's functional obsolescence?
1,Availability of ebooks,"as a user of a reb1100, i received an email that they are no longer selling ebooks!!! Why are you trying to sell their products"
4,"Great!, but.....","Saw it in Staples and bought it for $100. It seemed to be the answer to my dreams, a portable thing to read text on. It feels great, works fine, lasts a long while on a charge, is just good execution of an idea.But what is needed, the ONLY thing that is needed, is a utility to convert .txt, .doc, and .pdf files into a form that this RCA1200 can read. Otherwise this is just the best thing simce sex, for congenital readers like me. Hack away, freaks, building the utility I spoke of will surely grant you some place of reverence in the Divine Database, and give this great product a wider life and application."
1,"Not panning the book, just the edition","A warning to those who want to buy this book: It is laid out as if one were reading it on-line, with each block paragraph separated by a full line. Longer spaces between paragraphs in the original edition are not marked as such. Much of the rhythm of the original book (or its original translation, at any rate) is lost in this format."
5,great buy for a great price,So far its been working good for me hooked up to 6 speakers including the 100 watt subwoofer i purchased for it was not hard to set up plugged into my tv via optical cord via tv/satalite input added mp3 player hooked up 7 band equalizer for fine tuning speakers for music dvd still intend to hook my old vhs tape player and a tape to dvd recorded and maybe my old karaokie tape machine to practice some songs the only thing that i miss is not having a remote for it this would have been the final topping on my cake.
1,nice until it fails,"I purchased this unit a bit over a year ago and after a year my front right speaker output failed....i used to be a big fan of sony, however i have noticed that their quality is going down hill....after this one failed (like a similar one two years ago) i purchased a harmon kardon AVR-125 and hope to have better luck with it....from now on i am staying away from sony"
1,I RETURNED IT,"Technology gone wrong...My big problem with this unit is running two sets of front speakers at the same time. A or B, but not A & B. Apart from this show stopper, I spent about 5 hours trying to hook up this device, be prepared to buy additional digital optical and S-video cables (nothing is included). The manual is worthless. As mentioned, I need a receiver that can drive two sets of front speakers, so I returned it."
4,Good but short,"I have a 2000 Ford Expedition and these are a good addition. But, they are short, I was hoping they would reach down more but its good enough"
1,look at it first,I agree it has too many flaws it used to be on my wishlist but now I read the costumer reviews and it doe'snt even look funand it cannot be educational because no kid has a chair in their bath tub
3,"This looks cool,","The only thing wrong, I see in the picure of the asscessories it comes with, I have just assessories. i bought them in a seprate item. And they will only fit the Kelly dolls. I never saw a shower like this. I mean who is going to sit down and Take a shower. I mean I like what I see, I thinks it's pretty cool. But, Barbie must be pretty lazy."
5,A Wonderful Symphony!,This is simply a wonderful symphony! It seems incomprehensible to me why symphony orchestras don't perform this work - audiences would love it. I highly recommend this CD to anyone looking for an unknown work written in an incredibly accessible and romantic style!
5,Excellent,"I am by no means an expert in using the soldering iron, but these DO NOT change shape from the heat. The previous commenter must not have tinned his iron enough or bought a cheap iron. I RECOMMEND these plugs. Mine are superb."
4,Very good connector,This polarized connector won't vibrate loose. You really have to pull hard to disconect it. Just about everyone in our R/C model plane club uses them. The flat blades are some what difficult to solder to or I would have rated it a 5.
4,Not the best quality but will do the job,"These plugs are deans compatible but are made of much softer plastic that start to soften as soon as you solder the wire to the connector. They work fine, but you have to solder quickly to keep them from melting. I will get real deans plugs in the future."
2,Does not work!!!,I bought tbis product to keep hot water to make my baby's formula. The water would not stay hot and was luke warm within 2 hours. Does not work at all. I ended up getting a Nissan Thermos and I am very pleased. That product kept the water hot for over 12 hours. Thats what a thermos should do right?!?!?!?
5,One of my favorites,"Without a doubt, Joan Grant is one of my favorite authors.One of the best authors on past lives. Highly recommended."
2,Two good pianists = one bad CD,"I'm sure Bradshaw and Buono are good pianists. However, in their eagerness to prove this they've embellished Liszt's score with unnecessary, atonal flourishes to the point of annoyance. I could only bear to listen to the first few tracks. Their rendition of Hungarian Rhapsody must have Liszt spinning in his grave. Even if they'd stuck closer to the original score, they play so far out of sync with each other you'd think they were competing - not playing a duet.This truely is a terrible CD. I doubt I'll ever play it again. I wonder if I could donate it to charity and get a tax writeoff."
4,Terk Weatherproof splitter,"I was in need of a splitter for our new Dish-less, and cable-less, entertainment set up. Upon research, this add on item proved just the ticket. No big surprises, it just works. No dirt added to the signal, clean pass through.Thank you."
5,Great product,"This splitter works well and has had no noticeable impact to the quality of the reception we get. With free shipping from Amazon Prime, it's also a great price!"
3,Looks great on my daughter,"It was a great price, I didn't like the wings but liked the rest of the costume very much. Great deal"
4,Effortless Passion,"There's something irresistible about Julio Iglesia's singing. He exudes an effortless passion of romance in nearly every song he touches. It's no surprise that finally he has released an album concentrating solely on romantic tunes. However, at first glance, some of his choices might seem out of character. With two Foreigner songs, ""I Want To Know What Love Is"" and ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"", Julio injects dreamy casualness that begs a listen from worldly lovers. Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking"" has a spirited freshness and the Bee Gees, ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart?"" is a completely new interpretation. There might be a temptation to classify these songs as pure elevator backtracks, but Iglesia never falters in his quality. The only question here is why it took him so long to produce an album concentrating solely on romantic classics. There is no doubt there will be a follow up and his fans are already anxiously waiting."
4,Another Instant Favorite,"Have loved his music for a long time, in English or Spanish. His voice and singing is instantly recognizable and ageless. I have my all time favorite recording which is ""1100 Bel Air Place"",but ""Romantic Classics"" is truly is a wonderful CD and I am very glad to add it to my collection.It is the perfect CD to get or give to your friends and family and I have a sister-in-law who is going to love receiving it from me."
5,BEST SERVICE EVER!,THIS WAS THE BEST SERVICE EVER. PROMPT AND ON TIME.I WAS ALSO NOTIFIED WHEN TO EXPECT MY PURCHASE.
1,If it survives the shipping,I ordered and received one of these inverters and it fell apart during the shipping. I strongly recommend that buyers should demand pre paid return shipping for defective units.
1,"No quality, no repair, no clue","I bought one of these and a large one (3000 watt) but in less than two years both have failed. Both different failures. Contacted the comapny, they say they do not service thier product because it is not ""cost effective"". If you open one of these up you see that componets are haphazzardly soldered, some not even mounted on boards. Very poor build and parts qualityand no wiring digram available, so after spending $600.00 if it works for a year and then a $2 resistor fries or something ele inside breaks you have to just throw it away. Spend a few more bucks and get one that will last longer than a year and is backed by a comapny that makes a product that will last longer than its warranty and that can be serivced when it does break."
1,Not the same size!,"This is supposed to be a replacement for a Panasonic HHR-P401. This battery is about 0.5 cm longer than the Panasonic, and is unlikely to fit in any cordless phone battery compartment which previously housed the Panasonic. Therefore, as a replacement for the Panasonic, it is completely useless."
2,Cracked!,"Great board for large roasts, turkeys, etc. We got ours as a gift last Christmas. We took it out to carve our turkey yesterday and it is cracked all the way through. I admit, I never oiled it. Also, don't expect the best quality Henkels knife to be included. I am looking for another board and this time I will be sure to surpass the boards that include a carving knife and fork since they are not nearly as good as my own cutlery."
3,Silly pirate book perfect for young ears,"This book is the perfect fun read for your pre-schooler age 5 and under who is curious about pirates and you want to keep it light. Plus it's a quick read when you're looking for something short. My only caution is if your child repeats lines from books-- beware of ""surrender cowardly scum!"""
4,Cute and fun!,"This book is great. I got it for my son's 3rd birthday since he thinks he actually is a pirate! On his actual birthday, I read this to his pre-school class and they loved it. It does have some language that I would be careful with, make sure they know not to repeat it...but I think they get it. They talk about pirates having jolly fights and they are ""fighting"" with mops and smiles on their faces. I actually enjoy it too and even my almost 5 year old who is extremely girlie seems to enjoy it too."
4,Snappy little book,This is a snappy little book because of the rhyming style. My grandsonlike it and enjoyed the illustrations which are large and colorful.
4,A fun and easy book,"My three-year-old grandson loved this book, especially as it was accompanied by a pirate ship! We had fun discussing in advance of his reading it whether pirates really did take baths. Very enjoyable read for all."
4,Fun for kids into pirates,"It's not great literature, but I got this for my son for his fourth birthday. He's into all things pirates, and he enjoys this book."
3,"OK, but not MT's best effort","I had the MT 10 cd set for beginning French and thought it was great. In preparing for a trip to Italy, I got the Italian version. It isn't as good, primarily because MT seems a bit lost at times. He doesn't control the two students who sometimes seem to be in charge of the lesson. There are long exasperating stretches when the instruction is practically non-existent while we listen to the students grope for what to say and how to say it in Italian. It still gets three stars because MT's method gives a lot in a short period of time, even with his shortcomings here."
1,Would have loved it but....,"This was a really great way to learn Italian except the grating annoyance of having to constantly listen to someone whose pronunciation was horrific. The woman's voice (student) sounded like she'd never heard Italian spoken before. Come on, use Italians so we can learn how the language is supposed to sound. We're going to be mimicking a really, really bad accent. I wanted to listen but I really just couldn't stand it."
2,Strange,"First, Michel is a male.Second, Michel has such a heavy accent (but not Italian) that in a number of cases I had to listen the the Italian to understand what he was saying in English.He gets hung up on some small details (incessant repetition of the two pronounciations of ""vuole"").If he spelled some of the more confusing words, I might have had some idea what he was saying. He says ""chalk kay"" dozens of times, but since he gave us no clue as to the construction of the sound he was making, I had to do some research to determine that he was saying ""cio che"".I think I will go elsewhere for my next lessons. Maybe from someone who is a native speaker of at least English or, preferably, Italian."
1,Tekton drive reducer,Tool broke apart on first use. Used with a torque wrench and it snapped at 250 ft/lbs. Save yourself the hassle and buy a quality tool!
1,Isn't strong enough,"I didn't liked this one, it doesn't look like a single piece, looks like the 1/2 in part is mounted on the 3/4 female, so it started to twist apart on the firs use with a high torque impact wrench. Had to return right away."
1,Five knucle shuffle for those with no life.,"Okay. . . I must confess I wasn't able to sit through the whole show. The thing that struck me most about the video was the fact that I had absolutely no interest in any of the sad and lonely - i'll get my t***s out if you look at me - women featured. All the birds are typically ulgy in body and mind. It would take any normal bloke less time and effort to go out and find a better looking, nicer and infinately more intelligent woman. One who doesn't need to reduce herself to material specifically taylored to those men who like nothing more than a good hitch-hike to the ceiling infront of the T.V"
2,good enough but repetitive,"It is definitively not too hot for TV. Don't expect to see much in it, just your usual, every day, talk show, with a marketing titleBesides, most of the clips are the same: ""I slept with your brother"", and then a fight starts. It's better to watch a Jackie Chan movie for that.It's maybe nice to see once, but disappointing to own."
3,Women's Rights groups should not see this!!!!!!!!!,"If you like ""Playboy""-type stuff then this video is definitely for you!!! I felt their was too much nudity and not enough action. However the scenes where they were fighting and cursing each other were cool!!!"
4,Belkin Wireless G Range Extender,"Purchased two of these units. One works really well and the other has to be reset occasionally. Setup is a little more complicated, so if you are not too tech savvy I would suggest getting some help with it. Overall I am satisfied with it, the unit handles 6-8 user requests with minimal slow down."
3,"easy to setup, good device","Easy to setup and get working, even with security turned on. I bought this as gift for my mom to act as a wireless repeater because the wireless signal just doesn't quite make it to part of the house Just changed the IP on my laptop, plugged it in to the belkin extender, set everything up via the web interface, and then Plugged it into the wall when I was done.The only complaints I have about this devices are: 1) I found the documentation to be weak. Didn't specify what the default IP address of the device was. A quick search on google got me what I needed, so it wasn't a big deal. 2) The CD that ships with the device for the ""auto-setup"" doesn't work on Vista or Windows 7. The CD isn't really needed though, so again, not a big deal. 3) Occationally the device appears to get hung up and needs to be power cycled so the wireless starts working again."
2,Better to just get N-draft,"I must admit, my purchase of this unit was ""cheaping out"" - I was trying to extend a wireless G unit, to avoid or defer a costlier upgrade to Wireless N.The unit worked, after the requisite hour or so on the phone to India. But ultimately it is no substitute for just biting the bullet and upgrading to Wireless 802.11N. I sent the unit back, bought a wireless N unit, and have lived happily ever after."
1,Worked great when it worked...,"I have to say the product was extremely easy to set up and worked as expected for six months. Then it stopped working. When I called Belkin I was told they no longer manufacture the product. I reminded them of their 'lifetime guarantee' and though they finally covered it, they claim they don't cover guarantees on 'discontinued' products. I am also amused that when I bought the range expander it was about $45.00--now that it is no longer manufactured, the price has jumped. There is a reason Belkin no longer makes this product, or any range extender that I can see--not one of their finer moments."
4,Works as Advertised,"I recieved this, unpacked it, pluged it in, pressed the auto connect button, and it was up and working. Seems to work great as a range extender."
2,"Difficult setup, if you can even get it to work, and not Vista compatible!!","After several hours of trying to get this thing working, I just returned it. Upon opening the box, there is a slip of paper stating that it is not compatible with Vista and that there *might* be drivers later. There is a quick start guide that looks extremely easy, and if it worked, it would be.Step 1. Throw away the quick start guideStep 2. Insert the included cd and read the 57 page user's guide that shows you how to really set it up.Step 3. Give it a shot.If you don't have encryption on your router (not a good idea) it would probably work ok. But if you do, then you must turn off the encryption, reset some settings on your pc, get the range extender to connect to your network, reset everything you just turned off and see if it works.I never got anything working, got tired of messing with it and just got a refund. It would probably be a good product if you are able to get it to work."
3,Belkin F5D7132 Wireless,"It works, but had one heck of a time getting it located in the proper location. It was easy to install but still can't get a very strong signal."
1,Not worth the hassle,"It did improve my reception. However, it drastically slowed down my connection. I felt like I was on dialup.I returned the unit and decided to just increased the transmission power using dd-wrt which has about the same effect sans the slow down in the download speed."
3,Service was great not the product,The the wireless-G extender was a bad buy because it isn't compatible with Windows Vista and there is no warning on the outside of the box. Only after you open it does it tell you that Vista and a few other OS don't work on it.
3,"Good product, good price, poor support","I am using this to strengthen an unencoded WiFi signal within my home. I called Belkin support when the receiver, when relocated near the remote location, would not pick up the signal it locked on to originally. I called Belkin support, and was told I had to configure the unit, even though I explained I was not using encryption. I figured that would be a weekend project, and left it alone. After a day or so, the flashing red indicator went out, and my signal strength on my remote PC went from ""Very Low"" to ""Very Good"" or ""Excellent."" These reviews were more helpful than the instructions or Belkin support. Overall, though, it's doing what I wanted it to."
1,Its crap,Never could get it to work. Wont purchase from amazon again. word 1 two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
1,Never finds a signal to extend!,Terrible product. Never finds a signal to extend. ON;line configuration never worked! Not worth the hassle! Remember...you get what you pay for!
1,Belkin Universal Range Extender,"Useless product. Did not work, and after 3 hours of phone back and forth trying to fix it, (good effort) decided to replace. Then, appeared the gadget was discontinued, they don't have similar product, and are debating the way to refund. Do not buy."
1,"MISREPRESENTED, NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LINKSYS WIRELESS-G ROUTER","You are asking for trouble if your network is controlled by LINKSYS wireless router(s). Belkin does not properly represent this device in its advertising or in the user manual. Nothing in the Belkin spec sheet or user manual indicates that this unit will not automatically associate with Linksys Wireless-G routers. There is nothing at Belkin online support or in the PDF user manual about the issue. After wasting an ENTIRE EVENING - 3 hours - with a Belkin ""technical support"" agent who had to read from instructions, we were told to contact LINKSYS. We did that. LINKSYS tech support would not help set up a Belkin device of any sort. So, this unit is being returned by this dissatisfied customer. If you buy this unit, you'd be best off using it with other Belkin products."
2,It's cheap,Not really easy to setup. Does not accept DHCP assigned address it must be manually configured on the network to operate as an access point. Goes off-line often but comes back when power is recycled. Ok for my purposes (occasional use) but I would not recommend for dependable wireless access.
1,A range extender that needs its range extended,"Like in many of the other reviews, the setup experience was not great (crappy setup UI, pieces of configuration seemed to disappear after reboot, and so on). Finally I got it connected to my wireless router. Moved to 20 feet away -- still connected. Moved to the planned location which was 30 feet away -- oops, connected no more.Tried many configuration combinations to no luck. I'm returning it in the morning.By the way, the box was devilishly confusing: it labeled different wireless technologies like pre-N MIMO in big fonts, as if the device were compatible. But in fine print it says it actually only supports the vanilla G. Why does it want to educate me on things it is uncapable of? I guess this does not matter much since people buying it here are not looking at the box when they decide to buy. But still..."
2,Unsupported by Belkin,"Do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this product! Unlike others who reviewed this product, I had very little trouble getting it to work properly. What I DID have trouble with was keeping it working properly. One or more computers on my network will routinely either lose contact with the unit, or the unit itself will lock up hard, necessitating me going across the room and cycling its power. Doing this every day gets old really fast. What's even more disturbing is trying to check for that necessary firmware update that will make everything OK, only to be greeted by a 404 error in the device's web interface. Belkin's tech support is also useless. They just parrot back the exact same useless information that's in the manual. If you're looking to buy a wireless range extender, keep shopping."
1,Didn't work,"When I take my Laptop to the location of the range extender I get good reception, but this the range extender dosn't work."
1,Not Vista supported,Belkin has made the decision not to upgrade this with Vista drivers or support. That's arrogant and not acceptable - Vista was released 12mth ago! Welcome to the 21th century Belkin! They include in the package - but not on the Web - that Vista is not supported. Thanks for the info - but a little late don't you think? Recommend to buy an extender from a compagny that follows the evoultion..
3,"Difficult to setup on ""protected"" networks","I have an entire network of Belkin products. And this is the first item I have had trouble with. After 4 weeks I still can't get it to work. It has a easy setup button on the back, which automatically configures the device. However, if you have anykind of protection using IP range limiting, mac address blocking, WPA, WEP or other mechanism to protect your wireless network, then the it is usless. I purchased 2 of these devices and neither one will operate on my wireless network. These devices have to be assigned a static IP address. This can be difficult if you have other devices which have dynamic IP address assigned by the server. Put the Extended / UR in the upper range of your available IP addresses. But like I said... I haven't figured how to get these to work. I will try the 24hour customer service next."
1,terrible experience,"Couldn't get it to work with my Belkin router. Spent 1 1/2 hours trying to get some intelligent support. On ""hold"" for most of the time. Support unable to help and told me the unit must be defective and returned. Wasted the entire evening. Support is horrible."
1,Device just doesn't work,I bought this to use as an access point and it just doesn't work.I can set the IP address and that is about all. All other attempts to change settings are erases when that device applies the changes and reboots.Very disappointed.
3,"Works, But a Challenge","We the freeNezy testers at eJawab Inc. found that 6 Hrs trying to set up an extendor is not worth the effort. However after the setup, it has worked with no problems for 3 months now. OTher than the setup, the product is great.- Vikram Jhaveri, Chico"
3,Check your router first to see if it supports WDS,"After getting the unit working (forget the ""one-button setup"", read the directions on the CD), I couldn't figure out why it didn't seem to help the signal strength. I then found out that my router (AT&T U-Verse 2Wire) doesn't support WDS (wireless distribution"". Neither does the Belkin Pre-N. If you aren't using something in the similar Belkin line, double check your documentation. Even after getting this on the network with security settings, you can't tell if it's actually doing its job from the setup page. Don't be discouraged by the setup. The directions work, though the setup is somewhat circular (set/recheck/reboot/etc)."
3,Works most of the time.,"First, thanks to all the other reviewers for their input. Their info helped a lot. My 1st extender didn't work. The company sent a new one and I sent the defective one back. It took several hours of tech support help to get it to work. It doesn't work all the time but now my TIVO is able to download data [most of the time]. The price on this product is great. Also, the tech support is helpful. They display their phone number prominently. I will still continue to buy Belkin products."
4,Works Perfect......after a little work....!,"Forget the instructions that came with the product.....useless, and does not automaticaly find your existing network. However if you use the detailed instructions listed on the site from the previous reviews, works like a charm. I use to get 2 bars in my basement, and now with the repeater located in the basement, I get a full 5 bars and my wireless laptop has never been faster. And can't beat the price too."
2,"Not quite ""press the button""","The Belkin F5D7132 advertises ""one button"" automatic configuration to extend a detected wireless signal. Not quite. First attempt ended in failure. Second attempt once we had found the IP address of the wireless server still did not work. Mysteriously, two days later a press of the button did do the trick. Afterwards, the Belkin seemed to boost whatever wireless it seemed to randomly select. Still trying to figure it out."
3,Belkin F5D7132 Wireless-G Universal Range Extender,"This unit offers several nice features:1) The antenna is connectorized, making it possible to replace the antenna. 2) The price is quite reasonable.3) The RF performance is fine. My signal range has increased considerably.However, there are some drawbacks:1) The firmware has bugs. When logging in and changing a setting over the remote interface, the firmware locks up, making it impossible to use the remote interface further. A hard reset solves the problems, but then all settings are lost. Power cycling also solves the problem, and retains settings. However, this is extremely unsatisfactory.2) The web interface is primitive, and requires special communication settings on your pc."
1,quality problem with AC adapter---defective,"I ordered the product and it was defective....would now power-up. Ordered replacement, also defective. Same problem. Belkin has a quality control problem with the AC adapter...apparently. Talked with technical support in India, nice, but very hard to understand. I have ordered a 3rd replacement, if this does not work, will want money back."
1,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEMAFTER READING THE REVIEWS AND SEEING THAT A GOOD AMOUNT OF PEOPLE HAD SUCCESS WITH THIS ITEM I DECIDED TO BUY IT THINKING THAT I WOULD TOOBOY WAS I WRONGTHING DIDN'T EVEN TURN ON
1,Very bad product,"I am an IT engineer and spent hours with this product to get it to work with wireless router, with no luck. Even Belkin's tech support couldnt help. It once worked for a short while, but then broke down again. Avoid at all cost - go with the more reliable products like linksys or D-link..."
3,OK at what it does.,"This range extender is pretty basic, and as such, it does an OK job. Its Windows-only configuration utility is touch-and-go at best in my experience, and its web configuration tool is very basic. I am using it to extend my wireless network at home, as well as using it to bridge a wired ethernet connection to my home server. In that capacity, the unit is also OK--if there is not activity initiated from its wired client, it often shuts down all connections to the client, which is annoying if you're downloading a file using the connection. If the firmware were updated with a keepalive feature, this product would be greatly improved. Overall though, the thing operates pretty well."
1,Marry Belkin & Dlink? Forget it.,"I bought the Belkin F5D7132 to work as a range extender with my Dlink DI-624 wireless router. It was a horrible experience trying to get it to work with the Dlink. The auto-configure function? Functional, but if it loses power (which it must in order to move it to its intended location after configuration) it forgets how to talk to the Dlink. Using the web browser interface is a losing proposition as well. The unit was completely schizoid regarding the result you might get from one moment to the next during the ultimately unsuccessful struggle to configure it.You might be okay if your intent is to get this device to talk to another Belkin device; otherwise I suspect you're asking to suffer if you intend for it to talk to a non-Belkin device."
1,Belkin Range Extender,"Belkin F5D7132 Wireless-G Universal Range ExtenderIt's useless. After spending 5 days trying to talk with tech support in India, they concluded the product was defective and arranged for me exchange it for a new one. The replacement is no better, and I have given up on it."
4,"Nightmarish setup, great techinical support (SHOCKING!)","I had issue that were contrary to other posters -- to reset you have to hold down the the reset button for 30 seconds. If you are still having trouble try chaning the SSID of your router and the extender so EVERYTHING matches.This thing stole about 4 hours of my life and converted it into pure hatred, but when I called tech support they were actually very helpful. In the first 10 seconds they could tell I knew computers pretty well so they didn't babysit me through every single step at all. He just told me what to do to fix some of the devices issues. Best tech support I have had. The thing works great now."
1,Good for an Open Network. Bad for secure networks.,CD that comes with the access point doesn't work with Windows Vista. Also it is difficult to configure if you have network security enabled.If you have an open network or you are connecting to an open network it is very easy to use.The documentation that comes with the Range Extender is a joke.I sent mine back after spending an hour trying to get it to work. And another 45 minutes on with Belkin Tech support who could only get it to work with security disabled.
4,Excellent for Intended Use as a Repeater,"The product works as a repeater, creates a seperate SSID so not seemless from one part of the ""bed and breakfast"" to the other, but guests with no reception in one area, can log into the network on a different SSID and get service. The one-touch connect did not work as the manual suggested, I needed Belkin phone technical support to get configured. The user guide does not cover the manual configuration approach I needed to do, not difficult once you know how to do it."
4,"Great product, once you figure out how to set up",Read other reviews regarding the setup of this product. While they were helpful I ended up having to call their support. After near 2 hours we got it working . . . That said once up it works like a champ. Would have given it 5 stars if not for the set up nightmare.
2,Frequent Signal Loss,"This works pretty well when it holds a signal, but it's inconsistent and inexplicably loses a signal far too often. I have it hooked up to connect to a specific network, and I can often connect (albeit weakly) to the source and not to the extender. Personally I wouldn't recommend it."
1,WARNING DOES NOT WORK WITH VISTA!!!!!,"Of course, you don't know this until you open the box. There is a sheet that advises you to check the website, and it says support is coming. I will return this along with the wireless N router I bought from Belkin. I think I'll stay with D-Link."
1,What a piece of junk,"This is such a piece of junk product. According to the instructions and sales material it will allow you to extend your wireless range. So after installing the unit I was surprised that I had a good signal in the before-bare area, very nice.Sadly it totally disrupted the signal where both the base station and the range extender covered. This is 90% of the house. When I called technical support they told that this is sometimes an issue and there is no work around and I should stay out of the effected area.I am trying to get a refund on the unit but I doubt I'm going to get anywhere. DO NOT BUY!"
4,"Product is great, instructions is inadequate","I just got this product working (as a range extender) within my network yesterday after some very frustrating experience setting it up. I use WPA-PSK authentication for my wireless network. As such, the auto configure buton does not work. The easiest way to set it up is by using the utility that comes with this product and with this extender connected to the existing wireless router physically. The utility was able to recognize the extender right away and I was able to reset its default IP address to match my subnet and then access its web interface from this utilty to setup the parent SSID and match the security settings. then restart the router and this range extender. Once I've done that, it works flawlessly."
2,Promising but not.,"I wished to extend my wireless signal (which is actually from a belkin wireless router) and was recommended the range extender. I had to call the tech support two times for help and was transferred to more expert tech staff. They were helpful but ultimately the device wasn't able to recognize the signal from the router, even when it was very near by in the same room. I tried with the help of the tech staff at belkin to tweak the modem and operating system preferences but nevertheless it still never worked. Thanx to Amazon I was able to return it for a full refund."
1,"Hard to set up, doesn't work well",I found this product cumbersome to set up. You need to place this right next to the router so it didn't increase my signal that much at all since my router was okay and the auto-config button makes it cumbersome since I have so many signals around my area. Not really worth the headache of this product despite its lower price.
3,Belkin and Netgear do not play well together,"I have been looking for a wireless bridge/range extender for some time; my network has grown organically, i.e. I solve one problem at a time, with what I can find at the time. My routers (wired and wireless) are in the basement, but I need connectivity everywhere.I used the 'range extender' option, and synced up the Belkin Extender with my Netgear Wireless Router. I had to hold it quite close, and it took nearly a minute, but the 'searching' light came off indicating a successful sync. So far, so good.Moving the extender anywhere else in the house, however, resulted in it not being able to find my network again. My Blackberry can find the network in my bedroom, two floors up, but this product couldn't find it from across the same room.Tech support suggested that I call Netgear and ask them to help me reassign the frequency. Thanks, but no thanks.I'm glad that some people found true happiness using this product. I just wish it had been my turn."
2,Horrible Extender,"I received my first extender about 3 weeks ago, only to find out it was defective after speaking with tech support for nearly 2 hours! Had it RMA'd and replaced, paying $10 for the return shipping. Got my 2nd extender about a week ago and it's working ok so far, but I'm not at all impressed by its overall range -- signal strength fluctuates a lot even just at the next room."
5,Range Extender works like a charm,"Plugged it in & it was able to send a really strong & constant signal to my Mac. It should be noted that Belkin is the system that the PC, from which my mac was drawing an internet signal, was using as well. Belkin range extender worked much better that the previous one that I tried."
2,Belkin F5D7132 Wireless-G Universal Range Extender,"it looses sync with wireless router, even when in the same room. For what it does it is overpriced. I bought it link my satellite receiver to the Internet for on demand purposes. It does not do the job. Belkin no longer makes this device and I certainly understand why. I trashed this one and purchased a Hawking range extender and it works great."
3,"what ever you do, DO NOT CALL BELKIN SUPPORT..","first off configuration: called belkin support to find out one simple thing. what ip address to use to configure the box for EMAC address filters..... theY were CLUELESS... NOT sure what all the hoopla is about. it took 15 minutes to set up my wireless extender.plugged the box in next to my wifi box, hit the auto connect button... plugged into a computer on the lan, typed in the IP add... added my MAC addresses to the filter list, saved it, uplugged it took the boX to the garage plugged it in and BAM..... ALL DONE...The extender seems to work great... Put it in my garage so when i am next door playing poke in my neighbors garage, i can surf on my iphone... dont know why its taking some people 3hrs???? perhaps its a WEP issue.....signal is now reaching the neighbors garage at full signal..... woooo wooo... well worth 29 bucks"
1,It gets one star for price,"The price was right, but after several hours (yes, hours) of playing with locations, rebooting, etc., I was unable to get it working properly. I was trying to get it to pass a signal over a stone wall to an addition in the house. The best I was able to do was to get the computer in the addition to display that it was getting an ""excellent"" signal, but when I tried to access any web page, I got ye olde Internet Explorer message stating that the page could not be found. I sent it back to Amazon and got refunded."
2,"Works as advertised, but don't follow their install instructions","Works as advertised, I'm connecting this unit to a Dlink Gamerlounge with WPA2 enabled. The range on this thing is pretty good as long as you're not going thru too many walls. The install instructions that come with the unit are garbage, which is why I docked 1 star on my rating.UPDATE: I've been using this thing for more than a few days now, and I notice it drops off my wireless network after 24-48 hrs very consistently. It's a champ when it's connected, but this dropping off my network every day or so requires a hard reset. So, unfortunately, I have to return this to Amazon."
5,Great Wireless Range Extender Easy to Set Up,"I bought this product based on price and technical specs, I was skeptical when I read the comments about it here but I can tell you that it works 100% as I expected. Very easy to set up and configure as wireless range extender, just by following the user's instructions."
2,3 years later: dead,"I don't recall it being terribly difficult to configure, but the device started having problems after about a year. Devices connected to it would still show as being connected, but no traffic would pass. A quick reboot (unplug/replug) of the Belkin extender solved that problem, so eventually I just put it on a timer that rebooted it every morning. I later moved and no longer needed the extender, so into the network bin it went. I pulled it out recently to reconfigure and send to my dad, but it's fairly dead now. I can log into the web management interface, but it stops responding after a few minutes - regardless of which page in the management interface I'm looking at. I tried multiple browsers on my PC and my Mac, but no go. Into the trash it goes!"
4,20+ for 2+ years,"I don't understand the negative reviews. I've used more than 20 Belkin Range Extenders for more than 2 years to cover a 27-acre, half tree-covered RV Park with great success. A few odd programming problems crept up from time to time but considering their up time/down time and 24-hour use, they've proved themselves reliable and time tested little workhorses for nearly 300 clients. Follow the instructions and you're good to go wireless."
2,Good when it;s working,"When this device randomly locks on to the host signal it is strong and consistent, working for a few weeks at a time with no interrupts. Then it loses the host signal and re-estashblishing the connection is a frustrating, annoying event of resetting, moving antenna around and playing voodoo games. Hooking it up via ethernet cable to a PC and speaking with online help didn't work either; today it is locked-on and working well. In a week or so I'll go through the same silly dance again."
1,Keep breaking down,"Get the produce and works great for 10 days and it broke down, the searching light keep flashing and never able to find the signal any more. Return it and get a second one works great again, and after 2 weeks dead again same symptom. May be a production problem and they fixed it now, but don't border and I am avoiding Belkin products."
4,It works,Follow the instructions you can find in other reviews and the device will work just fine.I have it over an year and it works perfectly.
3,Good range but bad firmware.,"It's a very nice Extender as well as repeater, but the only complaint I have is there's no new updated firmware for it. Don't know why it keeps kicking me out after 3rd or 4th click in the software configuration. I've tried to contact Belkin Support three times, but they keep putting me on hold for average 35-40 minutes and still didn't get problem resolved."
1,Don't buy this product!,"I was very disapointed in this product! They do not tell you this product is not compatable with WAP2 encription and is only good with WEP which is worthless. In addition, they do not tell you this product does not work with Vista.Do yourself a favor and don't consider buying the Belkin Range Extender!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS - OR ANY OTHER BELKIN PRODUCT!!,"Bought this and after being on the phone for hours and hours with FOUR different technicians each trying the same fixes, they decided it didn't work. They wanted to replace it but then they found that it was discontinued. Yes, discontinued. Belkin doesn't sell a range extender any more. AND, their instructions tell you that you can't return it to the place where you bought it!After several more phone calls to their terrible customer service system I was told that they would offer me a $50 web credit if I sent it back. That means they would give me $50 off Belkin products sold on their web site, which was LESS than what I paid for it, plus I didn't want any of their products. So, I am screwed!DON'T BUY BELKIN!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not the easiest!,This product is only easy to use if your network is not password protected. Otherwise it is extremely difficult to set up. I finally gave up and unsecured my network. Made things much easier for now.
4,Yay for Belkin Customer Service,"After a hour of trying to setup the device to no avail (not a networking guru and yes the instructions were confusing), I phoned Belkin's customer service, they were great, step by step directions were given as I was on the phone. Now the device works great.Update: have used the device for over 6 months now and the range extender still works great (have a D-Link router). only headache occurs when the cable modem, router and the range extender requires to be reset due to connection issues - for the extender took a few mins to locate signal."
1,"It may be able to leap tall building, but I can't","The box with the extender arrived, and I dutifully read the directions (which is kind of hard for a Mac person). Then I tried to set up the extender to no avail.Going back to reading the directions, I found the segment that said you have to have the encryption off during the setup. So I turned it off, but got nothing. Then I decided to wait for my nephew to come over to activate the extender. He, who happens to be an EE fresh out of Hopkins, and me (who is also an EE, but much older) worked on getting the unit up for about 3 hours. Then, having given up any thoughts about getting it working, we shipped it back to Amazon.BTW the one step button didn't work for us. That was the first thing we tried."
3,decent value hard to get to work,"took about one hours worth of work and one call to tech support to get operational. Works ok, does extend the range for reception based on the wireless computers signal strength meter, not sure if helps performance.The review by Chovy was very helpful, if i did not have a WEP question for tech support his was all i needed to set up system. I would recommed reading his review before setup and try to do what he said."
3,"Works, eventually (or not)","Like nearly everyone else, I discovered quickly that setting this device up is not at all easy. If you don't want an open network, the one button configuration is out. What you do to set it up ... I'm not entirely sure what worked, to be honest. I was about this close -><- to taking it back for a refund when whatever the last set of changes I made was, worked. About the only advice I can give is that it doesn't always reset on its own after you make changes from the web interface, even if it says it is resetting; try unplugging the thing, waiting ten seconds, and plugging it back in.It does work--I'm posting this review over it from a room where I couldn't get any signal before. I just wish everyone good luck getting it working.Edit: I take it back (and will, literally). It's cutting the signal in and out randomly. I don't need the hassle. Apparently I can't change my star rating. If I could, it would go to 1. What a waste."
3,"Cheap, but is it worth the aggravation.","The usual punctual service from Amazon, but I still have not gotten the setup right on the range extender. I would highly recommend that someone who does not want any added stress look at a different product and stay away from this one. regardless of how inexpensive the price point is.Someone who knows what they are doing can make it work, or so I have read, but as someone with moderate computer skills, and pretty good knowledge in some areas, but not networking. I am struggling to get any results.I am pretty sure it will work, but I still don't have any result to post about this product. Documentation seems weak, and the setup disc will not work with Vista."
4,Descent range extender,"Worked well. One thing to note is that the device DOES work with Vista, but the setup CD does not. You'll have to set it up manually."
1,Cheap for a reason,"The set up was atrocious, and we never got it working. Techs could not even communicate with the unit via ethernet connection to install new firmware (We had v. 2000). After five hours on the phone with India where every earnest kid practiced his newly learned computer skills on us, we bought a more expensive Linksys which was easy to install and works well."
2,Not performing as expected,"I get a weak wireless signal at my cabin, about 300 yards from my neighbor's place. He's okay with me using his wireless signal, I just needed to boost it. The unit first boosted the correct signal, but even though I had the password and everything set up I could not access the internet. He replaced his wireless router with one that didn't have password protection. I thought this would make it work, but now the Belkin unit is grabbing a different wireless signal, one that again doesn't work for me. I can't control which signal it boosts. Talking with their support was frustrating (poor english) and didn't solve the problem. It now sits unused until I can muster the energy to dive back into problem-solving mode."
3,"'One-click' setup, my backside...",I'm not going to reiterate the details of the many reviews below that point out how hard this is to set up and how useless the instructions are.Suffice to say it took me four hours to get it working and I am pretty technically proficient.It works now but it cost more than 50-odd dollars in annoyance and frustration. It's also much easier to set up with a spare laptop so it can be configured in situ and NEVER unplugged.
2,not as easily compatable as advertised,This product advertised one button compatability and setup. This didn't work for me. Tech support couldn't help me without specific info from the router I was using. They wanted to manually input IP addresses on the computers and it was just too much hassel. A different brand worked like a charm.
4,Excellant extension to Belkin router,"It works great for the purpose I bought it ... extend signal from a Belkin 54G router.As an experiment, I tried the extender with a 2WIRE router from SBC. It did not work."
5,Great Product,"I am using my friend's internet connection. His signal was of average strength (2 bars).The installation was tricky. The manual says to press the autoconnect button, but when i did, it always picked up some other network's signal. So i had to attach the device to my computer with an ethernet cord. Now i changed the ip address of my LAN to 192.168.2.100 and the subnet mask came up automatically. I had to disable all my firewalls and internet connection. After that i typed 192.168.2.254 in my internet browser and after 2 or 3 attempts the configuration setup opened. From there i selected my friend's internet connection. Then i disconnected the device from the computer and moved it to a different room. It connected to the network in few seconds and i got 5 bars on my computer. Signal strength all around the house is great.p.s. This will create a whole new network with a distict name. If you choose the same name, there will still be 2 different networks with same name."
3,belkin range extender,I saw a different companies extender in use but I had more respect for Belkin. Bought it to find out it wasn't what I needed. I'm sure it is a good product but I got the wrong one for my use.
1,Colossal Piece of Crap!,"Believe what you read, it's a piece of crap. I've connected it, I've changed the IP, I've even gone into it and changed all the settings. Nothing works. I knew things were bad when the ""push the button to automatically connect"" routine failed miserably. I called tech support and they were just as bad as this product."
1,Did not work for me,"I wasted several hours with this device until I finally gave up. The technical support was polite and seemed knowledgeable, but could not help me. I ended up returning this device and bought a high powered USB receiver instead. This solved my problem for about the same price."
1,Wireless Range Extender,The product was not available after I ordered it so I have no opinion of it's performance. It was estimated to be available in March. I may try again to see if it is available then.Charles Kelly
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,This unit is a piece of trash. It DOES NOT connect easily or quickly. The directions are useless. The tech support isn't worth calling. I tried all of the connection tricks outlined in the other reviews and the #%&* thing still wouldn't work. The hammer fixed it though....
1,Defective!!! Replacement was too!!,"This product is horrible. It takes hours to set up. I didn't even get to set it up correctly. The product was defective (Belkin tech support told me it was practically right away when i told them the problem). Anyway i got it replaced it the second one did the same thing as the first one. So i returned it for a refund. I will never buy another Belkin product again (iv had other products of theres before and there just horrible and there tech support is even worse, like thats a surprise!)."
2,Not at all complete.,"I did not get the remote for this unit, the picture was misleading..I had thought that the remote would come with it. I'm disappointed."
1,NO MORE JWK ELECTRONICS,"Thank you for the refund of the initial payment. Unfortunately, I spent much more, like $5.00 at the beginning ,for returning not working remote control, and $ 14.19 for returning your VCR, which DID NOT RECORD in my place, even with the help of a mechanic. ""Auto programmed"" went well, all channels logged in,I could watch them on my TV set, but IT DID NOT record needed program, and I ordered it TO RECORD programs. It just DID NOT work! I lost so much time,and so many programs I have intended to record, not mention above expences, and got a lot of aggravation on the top of it.And VCR set , even, as I knew about it, was refurbish, but dirty, not cleaned properly, like was long standing in dusty place.Believe me, NEVER AGAIN with your JWK Electronics, as not reliable.Thank you, Barbara BernerItem being reviewedSony SLV-N51 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR"
1,Absolute Junk,"I had two Panasonic VCRs that worked flawlessly for almost 10 years. I replaced one of them with this Sony model and have had several problems after only one year. As other users have noted the tracking totally stinks, especially when watching tapes recorded on another VCR. There is no way to remove the tracking lines. Adjusting the tracking only lets you move the lines up and down the screen. Move the lines off and the picture starts jumping. It has also chewed up two tapes so bad that I had to take the cover off just to remove the tape. Sony makes good high-end electronics, but they must outsource this cheap stuff to some lousy contractor."
1,Is it really from Sony? Doesn't work like a Sony product.,I am a die hard Sony fan. My TV that I purchased 10 years ago is still working like new despite moving many times. But this VCR is just the opposite. I had to replace it with another after about a year.Cons:1. Supposed to rewind fast. But it takes many seconds to start the rewind.2. Chews cassettes. It chewed my kid's Lion King and Winnie the Pooh cassettes.3. Fast Forward didn't work after one year.Pros:Are you kidding?I didn't have much problem with picture quality. But overall this is a bad product.
1,Poor,I've had mine for about 4 months and now the picture jumps as it seems the tape is dragging. I took out a tape and looked at it and it's been creased on the bottom. Not very good quality and it's ruined a few of my tapes. I say stay away
1,headache from the start,"I bought this VCR because it's basically a cheaper version of the Sony N71, but with fewer features. It was easy to set up, and records a nice clear picture in EP, which was the most important feature to me. HOWEVER, I had problems from the moment I unpacked it. It makes an unpleasant plastic-on-plastic squeak whenever I record or play, loud enough to notice during quiet parts of whatever I'm watching. And some tapes that I've recorded on this VCR do not play well on other VCRs, which makes it unreliable for sharing tapes with friends or making permanent recordings of movies. Getting Sony to service the unit requires mailing it in at my own expense, another big hassle. DON'T BUY THIS VCR!"
1,Do not buy it,"We were so disappointed that Sony would put out such a bad product. I guess if it's cheep it doesn't matter who's name is on it, it's cheep.NOISY! Really annoying interface (cannot see time when watching a tape. Did an engineer actually use his/her brain when they implemented of that one).Picture quality is bad, red's especially bleed all over.DO NOT BUY! One other note, the 60sec rewind only works with 2hr tapes, shorter tapes take FOREVER to FF or REW."
2,Noisy operation,"It makes lots of noise as soon as the power is on, unlike the other Panasonic VCR I have. Also, it doesn't have LP mode, just SP & EP. The counter also doesn't appear on the pannel while rewinding, making it difficult to know where you are on the tape (unless you play with the remote control & see the counter number on the TV screen). I'm returning the unit!"
1,Junk,"I have owned Sony VCR's in the past and wanted to replace a 4 year old model with this one. What a piece of crab this is (actually all of Sony's new models are junk, since I replaced this with slv-n81 and same story!). The picture quality is really bad even when recording is from digital cable. Rented video's do not look very good either. If your looking to buy a vcr stay away from this year and last year's models. Ever since Sony moved it's production to Mexico, their quality has gone down dramatically. Sad!!"
1,Never Again,"I had a cheap (...) VCR for 7 years that survived two toddlers and countless hours of Disney replays. When I finally had to replace it, I looked for another inexpensive VCR that would stand up to more abuse from kids. I decided to spend a few extra bucks to get a Sony because of their reputation for high quality equipment. BIG MISTAKE!!! Within 6 weeks I started having problems with it. The audio went out completely, the picture was snowy on every tape, and it even started chewing up tapes. I got a huge hassle from Sony Customer Service. They tried everything possible to avoid honoring the warranty. When I finally received a replacement (ten weeks later), it didn't last any longer than the first one. So here I am again, waiting for them to send me another machine. It will be a long time before I even consider buying a Sony product again."
2,Sony VCRs are NOT what they used to be,"I viewed tapes on several of these machines (Sony SLV-N51) over the weekend. I was not pleased with the picture at all. Picture playback is what it should really be all about. All of these units I played pre-recorded tapes (SP mode) on looked grainy or almost like I was seeing double (hard to explain). The picture just did not look right. I played HOW THE WEST WAS WON, SPARTACUS and Disney's THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. The animated HUNCHBACK looked best. If you watch animated movies I suppose it did not look all that bad. It's difficult to recommend this Sony unit. This is very disappointing and unfortunate. I am getting the impression that manufacturers are letting their VCR lines get out the door with very little QA involvement. That is a shame."
1,The AMC Pacer of the VCR world,"This has to be the worst peace of electronic #@&! that I have ever bought. I have had two Sony VCR's in less than 6 months. The first one would not track and eat tapes when it rewinds, returned in and they gave me a new one. I had the second one for 110 days and it stop tracking on anything it recorded. Since its past the 90 days Sony told me that parts are covered but we all know it's the labor that cost. Please save yourself some money and time, do not buy any Sony VCRs"
1,Absolutely Intolerable,This VCR is absolutely terrible. I can hardly distinguish between shows recorded in the SP mode from the EP mode. They just look bad. Another annoying thing is with pre-recorded tapes. The auto tracking does not pick up the hi-fi track. I always have to adjust the VCR manually to get the hi-fi Stereo track. This is very annoying. Who cares that it rewinds pretty fast? The picture stinks and I always have to get up and adjust the tracking. What is going on with SONY? They used to make some of the best VCRs. I'm sorry but this VCR is junk
4,A great selection for all Florida book clubs,"I know many of you are wondering why anyone would live in Florida prior to the advent of air conditioning. You might even wonder why some of us choose to live in the central part of the state today. Gainesville in the words of the author is one of those places that ""gets a hold on a person."" I highly recommend reading Sand Mansions as the novel gives the reader an insight into the historical happenings that shaped north central Florida and gives you an excellent story as well. If you like romance, intrique, murder and mayhem, you'll find it here. If you are a member of a book club, please keep in mind that this book is not a quick read."
4,Not deep enough,"It was an ok documentary, however it did not dig deep enough into the details. There were still a LOT of unanswered questions, especially about his family's involvement, but I can understand why those issues as well as his sexuality did NOT come up."
3,rayful review,good doc. but would perfer if u had some up-to-date footage on rayful..understand he's under a witness protection prg..but that what makes a 3 star doc a 5 star doc.
3,True DC Story of Rayful Edmond,"As a little girl and DC native, I have always heard the stories of this Notorious Kingpin, but never the whole story. With this imformative docudrama you learn how he became the ""MAN"" to be around, and also how he failed off.The information was great but it could have been a little better on the eyes. The movie could have been true to the time era,80's and 90's,and not mixed with the up to date fashion. All in all as a first time director I am looking forward to more of his work"
1,Terrible Documentary,I watch alot of documentaries and this is by far the worst I have ever seen. I looked forward to watching it being somewhat familiar with Rayful's story but this dvd is just not made very well. This is an hour of reenactments. The story told in this dvd is so one sided. There is so much left I was left wondering why?There is a quote at the end of the film that is almost comical basically saying the producers did not want to glorify drug dealing. If you do not want to glorify drug dealing try showing all the bad that came out of all the drugs in D.C. at the time.I read that Kirk Fraser the maker of this film dropped out of film school at Howard University after watching this I think he should have stayed in school. This looks like it was made by a high school kid.
1,What a waste of telling a GOOD STORY,"I'm from DC so I know how the story went. A lot of details were left out. A lot of things were highly exaggerated. None of the actors (especially the guy who played Rayful) looked like the people they were playing, his arrest did NOT go down like that, no one was wearing ALL-DAZ clothing BACK THEN and they never mentioned anything interesting about Rayful that people don't already know ...like his sexuality.With a little more planning, better casting and creative advice from established Directors this documentary could have been a whole lot better.Since this is Kirk's first documentary he'll get a pass."
3,Need User Guide,"This is a great product for burning CD to CD, however, I want to copy from LPs to CDs. I borrowed it from my brother-in-law whom misplaced the ""User Guide"" and I haven't figured out how to make that feature work without it. Suggestions on where to locate it or excepts (instructions) from someone' copy can be forwarded to: gen_pur@msn.com. Thanks for the help!"
1,It Stinks,"Absolutely lousy. This is a photocopy of what was a marvelous original, and the photocopy stinks. This is unfortunate, as the content is very worthwhile."
5,A Retrospective of a Great Artist,This volume is one of the best written books about a living artist in our time with an informative timeline of the artist's life and achievements. Artwork is beautifully reproduced and delineated. This volume will soon be out of print.
5,really beautiful Kiki Smith book,"I was looking for a Kiki Smith book for my daughter, but was unsure which one to choose. This one is great!"
2,"I wanted to like it, but . . .","His mother is dying, but Pucker wants to stay gorgeous and have a string of girls throw themselves at him. He wants to live happily ever after as a mindless slave, and did I mention his mother is dying? Okay, I can understand the selfishness and conceit that overtakes him, I can see how he would be angry at his parents, I know I'm not suppose to like him because the author makes him unlikeable. But I thought he would do something bigger and more selfless at the end. After all, the Isaurian society is grossly unfair and rigid. Pucker's own father died rebelling against it. I wanted Pucker to do more, and he didn't."
5,"Great book for grown-ups, too!","I saw the glowing review of Pucker in the San Francisco Chronicle last week and just finished the book. It's terrific; reminds me of Lois Lowry's The Giver in its inventiveness, thought-provoking themes, and cross-over appeal to both teen and adult readers. Well-written and riveting. Highly recommended. A wonderful read by a talented author."
3,"Good story, not so good writer...","The idea of this story, I absolutly loved. However, I feel it could have been executed better than it was. Still a good book though."
5,A Must for McKennitt Collectors,"I am a new McKennitt fan but am a devoted one already. Some people might be put off by the fact that this is her first CD, but her beautiful voice and wonderful arrangements are already in place and she has chosen some delightful traditional songs. My favorite is the lovely arrangement of ""Carrighfergus"" where she is singing background harmony to Cedric Smith's perfect vocals, producing an exquisite rendering of this Irish classic. Another notable one is her original melody and dramatic arrangement of William Blake's ""Lullaby"". Not a loser in the bunch and oh, so great to see from where she started. You will not be disappointed."
5,Loreena is the best,Loreena is the best musician in the world. She has been part of my bed time ritual for over 9 years. What a great way to go to sleep at night.
4,simple & pure,"This album is simple and pure. This album and ""Parallel Dreams"" are different. They are more serious. There are not as many instruments, but her voice is the instrument we want to hear. I love music that is simple. I like hearing one's voice and not having is drowned with many instruments.Some may find ""Parallel Dreams"" and ""Elemental"" the better albums because they are pure and simple.Basically, if you like simplicity in music, THIS IS THE PERFECT ALBUM FOR YOU, INCLUDING ""Parallel Dreams""."
2,fans beware,"Loreena is a tremendous artist, and The Mask and the Mirror is probably my favorite CD of all time; but her debut, understandably though disappointingly, lacks the refined melodies and creativity of her later work. I don't think it's particularly the lack of other foriegn influences that makes it lag, though the lack of other instruments, even other Celtic instruments, does put a lot of pressure on her and her little harp to carry the same variety and movement. I have been a serious collector of Celtic music for about six years, and I've heared among it the most beautiful melodies and rythms in the west. All I can say is that it just took our worthy diva some time and experimentation to come to the flawless taste she has now."
2,I have heard worse.,Before I wrote this I listened to samples of her music.I really did not like what I heard.I know sombody likes her or she would have been out of business long ago.My personal taste tends to go along the lines of Enya.She has the true voice of an angel!!!
2,2 and 1/2 stars is the actual rating I would give this albun,"Loreena McKennitt is undoubtedly very talented, but she is very hard to understand! I find it difficult to enjoy an album when I have to strain to understand the lyrics of the song!I like her choice of songs.A singer that many other people compare with Ms. McKennitt is Kate Price. She is MUCH, MUCH better!"
4,Buddy Owens is a good communicator,"The quality of this product was perfect. The book itself is good, and I would certainly recommend it for reading."
4,Back view of this MHC-GS100 Sony Mini System,"Can anyone photo the back of this unit I need to know where to connect speakers. there are such contacts -- F-L,F-R,CEN,,R-L,R,R,S/W. but what they mean I dont know. Please if you know write which speakers should I connect there?Thanks !"
5,Cake rack / canning rack,My husband purchased this Harold Imports 9 1/4 inch round cake rack because I needed a rack to use for canning small amounts of jelly and jam. I must say this was fantastic for that purpose...helped make great Apple Pie Jam. It also works great as a cake rack. I like that it is stainless steel so no worries about rust. You can't go wrong with this item.
1,Rusts easily,"The build quality of this rack is pretty good, especially for the price.Anything placed on the grid will be raised 3/4"" off the surface.I got this rack for my pressure cooker, to raise canning jars off the bottom a little bit. Unfortunately, the rack rusted the first time I used it, since it was submerged in water. I did not expect this to happen since I have other racks that have held up to such use.This rack is advertised as suitable for steaming vegetables. I think you might end up with rusty veggies if you try that.I don't know whether the moisture from a cooling cake would cause rusting as well. Definitely don't leave it in a sink full of water."
4,A nice little rack.,"I bought it to use as a roasting rack, and it worked perfectly. Afterward, I put in bottom rack of my dishwasher, where it went through the long pots-and-pans cycle, and the high-heat drying cycle. It came out as bright and shiny as the day I received it. Not a bit of rust in sight.I'm quite pleased with it. I bought it to replace an old aluminum rack, which had to be washed by hand. I hate washing dishes by hand, so I really appreciate this nice little rack!"
2,Rusts like crazy,"Like the other reviewers I used this in a wet & hot environment and it rusted like crazy. I use it for sous vide so luckily my food is sealed, otherwise it would really discolor / shed a lot rust into whatever you are cooking. Maybe I am not using it correctly, but it is not stainless steel. It seems to be cheap chrome plated steel that rusts at the welds/joints."
5,Hope for all of us Middle Aged Dreamers,"Over the Hills: : A Midlife Escape Across America by Bicycleby David Lamb is a book for folks who like to read travel writing, people trying to do their personal best, or real adventure books. This is a great story about a person who made a promise to himself despite the misgivings of family and friends. His description of how this trip affected his fitness and details of towns and cities are wonderful. It shows what one man can do, for himself. You feel like your peddling right along with David Lamb. A great book, a fast read, and a great literary adventure. Buy this book."
1,for older sony portable,"Bought this battery to replace the factory battery in a sony portable phone that was about 8 yrs old. It was a perfect replacement for the original & charged up ok. But after approx one month it stopped holding a charge. I can't be sure it wasn't the phones charger, but it would be wise to buy another brand."
1,Love be dammed.,"One of the first Jorge Negrete. I remember seeing it when I was 8 years old and forgot all about it. Well, it brought back memories and now I know why I forgot all about it. It is not the Jorge of his later pictures. Not even one song. I guess in the olden days it was ok to be burned at the stake in the public square. I bought it for my collection and that is what it's going to be, a collection item."
4,Christmas in the Mountains,"I ordered this book after seeing a copy in a nearby antique shop. I was interested because it is about the area in which my family originates. It was also interesting that the shop owner's sister did the illustrations in the book. The book was not for sale in the shop, but I looked on Amazon, and was happy to find the book right away.The book itself is written from interviews with mostly elderly residents from the area, and interspersed with historical references regarding the origins of the customs. On some levels it is a little simplistic, but still interesting if for nothing else, for nostalgic reasons. The illustrations remind me of primitive artwork, which fits the style of the book. I would not call this a definitive work on the subject of Christmas customs in the mountains of Virginia, but it is still interesting to hear the accounts of the people interviewed.I was happy to find this book so easily on Amazon, and was pleased with the service provided by the carrier."
4,still worth reading,"Stuart Hampshire passed away recently, so it is very fitting to ask whether his books are still worth reading. This book is his best known one and I think it is stil worth reading it after many years of its publication. Some important themes are raised in this book, for example, the contrasts practical knowledge/theoretical knowledge, decision/prediction, the freedom of mind, etc. Especially I highly recommend this book to any one who is interested in the philosophy of action and the nature of intention.One defect of this book is that too many seemingly disparate subjects are dealt with somewhat summarily. Nevertheless I believe you will get some important ""clues"" in this book and can develope it yourself."
1,radio/phone,"I thought this battery would work with my radio/cordless Southwestern Bell phone, but it did not. I returned this, but have not received credit for this and the shipping charges."
2,Evaluation,"The package was received in good order and the battery looked like it should work in the our Bell South telephone Model 9926, however the connection would not fit in the telephone, so we returned the battery and Amazon was very cooperative and paid for the return. We were very satisfied with Amazon.Al"
4,"""Bullets Tend To Do That"" ~ Life On The Edge Of Eternity","The 1999 TNT original film 'Purgatory' is a unique and throughly enjoyable watch. Much like the classic 'Twilight Zone television series a specific time period and a seemingly ordinary place serve as the setting for an extremely unorthox tale. The time period is the American Old West, the place a small, off-the-beaten-path town known as Refuge. It is here that the world we know intersects with another and things are seldom what they appear to be. When a gang of outlaws ride into town they think they've come upon a place ripe for the picking and decide to take over and do as they please. Again, in the town of Refuge things are not exactly what they seem to be.If you're the kind of person who enjoys a good western, a quirky, out of the ordinary storyline and can appreciate a little morality tale as long as it's not preachy than this is the film for you."
4,Purgatory,Very good and entertaining movie. Great assembled cast and fun to watch. I especially liked the mix of old western firearms that were used and the complexity of some of the characters. Highly recommened for western buffs like me.
5,Great Movie!!,"This is a great movie at a very reasonable price! Fun Western to watch that is actually family friendly with teen-agers, something hard to come by these days!!"
2,Overrated B movie,"I am a big fan of Westerns. I like old and new and I am always eager to watch something different. This was a TNT original movie and as such my rating would be 4 stars which is to say better than most TV movies. However, by comparison to theatrical releases this movie pales and I can only give it 2 stars which is being kind.I loved the cast, but the acting was surprisingly bland. The script was not bad, but neither was it engaging. The action was weak, especially the shootout at the end which was edited poorly. The only thing I found that the movie had going for it was an insteresting premise which halfway through the movie had already grown old.When I see 4 and 5 star ratings and I think of all the great classic westerns, this just doesn't measure up. Open Range, a Kevin Costner Western that is just a few years old shoots circles around this one. I recommend watching this one first before purchasing, I wish I had."
5,amazing movie,"this is an amazing movie , the acting is wonderful. the plot uplifting.and showsthat people can be redeemed .it has good vs evil plot and good wins , i always love that get this movie you wont be sorry"
4,Purgatory,"Truly unique and different. I am not a western lover, but found this one a must for my DVD collection."
4,purgatory,good movie with an interesting take on the American western-almost turning the concept of the western on its head. Of course there is the big gunfight at the end
4,When good westerns are hard to come by!!Purgatory !!!!!!!!!,"Although"" Purgatory""is no Tombstone or YoungGuns.The story line & plot was a twist that made the Outlaws Heroes again."
3,A good movie for TV,"It would be hard for me to give this movie more than a three, since it is in the movie category and thus is competing with truly classic westerns such as, The Good the Bad and the Ugly. That being said, it is a good movie when you consider that it was made for TV. An entertaining western which has some great actors and an amusing plot. If I was to compare it to other TV movies, only, then I would say that it rated a strong 4."
2,Well the title says it all,"Without giving out the story line, it is purgatory. Kind of a cheesy movie. I was looking for newer release/modern westerns for my husband, this was not that good."
2,TiVo's great! The Recorder is not...,"Let me say TiVo Service itself is great, but this recorder is giving me problems. I've had it just over 6 months now, and lately I often find myself using the ""System Reset"" option. I can't count how many times the sound has sporadically cut-out or how often the message ""TiVo can't display Live TV"" has popped up. Every time this happens, the shows it taped are basically worthless: Either the first few seconds were recorded or the entire program was recorded w/out sound. It worked great for the first 5.5 months, but it doesn't look like this problem is going away. I'll have to do some yelling to the people at Sony. Look into a less expensive, better quality machine... Does YAMAHA makes one of these bad boys?"
2,Good while it lasted,"My SVR 2000 remote control just quit and can't be found anywhere, except on eBay for 49.99AND the newest review here says the unit won't work after Feb 2009 anyway. So I guess I go shopping.I've had it since May of 2003, so it has served me well. I'm lost without my Pause,Replay, and instant Record.Sony is no longer making this unit."
1,Service unacceptable,"This product required repair within 9 months of purchase. Unit mailed to Sony Service Center. Two weeks have passed and no acknowledgement, repair estimate or work order logged or received from Sony. Package was received with signature from by Sony. Lifetime TIVO service purchased, this is a waste also, the lifetime service is based on the individual unit purchased. So, if the unit breaks, you can't replace with the same ""lifetime"" service paid. The lifetime is based on the lifetime of the receiver/unit. Also, while your unit is being repaired, you have no DSS service since the reciever and the TIVO recorder are one unit. Don't buy Sony!!!"
1,Without a subscription and the latest software version it is a paperweight,"Be aware that there are SOME SVR 2000's that allow manual recording without a subscription. If you do NOT have the older software version, without a subscription the SVR 2000 is little more than a doorstop or paperweight."
5,It will change your life or at least your tv viewing!,"Tivo is one of the best products I have ever purchased. It's not only a great product but a life changing one. Before you think this is all hype, let me explain. By using a ""season pass"", you can record all episodes of your favorite shows automatically. So instead of recording shows each time, it does it for you. The result is that you have all your shows just waiting for you to watch when you come home. You get to spend more time watching what you like and there's no anxiety over missing a show. Because it records on a hard disk, there are no tapes to purchase or replace. I got purchased one without really understanding the benefits. Both my wife and I were blown away by this product. Once you get one, you'll never ever understand how you got by without it."
1,"Tivo rocks, Sony is the worst company in the world!!","Do not buy a Sony DVR!!! I've been on the phone for hours with 4 operators in India who have no idea what a DVR is. Yet, they work for Sony as technicians who are supposed to fix your DVR?!. Call a number, (nice) Indian operator who has no idea what you are talking about tries to help. She has no clue, so she gives you a new tele number to call. Next tech is just as clueless. I now go to buy ReplayTV because my friend loves his."
2,VCRs have more functionality,"Be aware that with Tivo, you cannot watch one channel while recording another. In other words, a capability that VCRs had 20 years ago is too advanced for the Tivo! What a waste!"
2,TiVo is great; Sony is a rip off,"My Sony SRV2000 worked fine for six months. First month into the lifetime subscription the Sony unit died.TiVo is willing to work things out with me w/r/t my product lifetime subscription.Sony on the other hand has offered to let ME PAY to repair the unit, only $92/hour for labor plus shipping. Sony calls this ""warranty service."" I can buy a competitor's product for less than the Sony service bill.The TiVo service is great.Don't buy Sony's products: they're overpriced and Sony doesn't stand behind them."
5,AWESOME MACHINE,"MY SONY TIVO UNIT HAS REVOLUTIONIZED MY TV VIEWING. IT IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO TV SINCE REMOTE CONTROL. EVENTUALLY ALMOST EVERYONE WILL OWN A TIVO UNIT. (I DO NOT HAVE STOCK IN THE COMPANY) TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS QUICK AND POLITE. TIVO IS THE LEADER IN THIS TECHNOLOGY, AND SONY HAS A GREAT TRACK RECORD. ONCE IT IS SET UP, IT IS VIRTUALLY FOOLPROOF. I CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH NICE THINGS ABOUT MY SONY TIVO UNIT. ENJOY, IT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY!"
1,"Abandoned by Sony, broken twice","The SVR-2000 is a discontinued TIVO DVR made by Sony. I bought it thinking that the Sony name would guaranty higher quality and reliability. I also bought the TIVO lifetime service. (Lifetime means the lifetime of the machine.)Within a year it crashed. We called Sony service only to find that they had stopped making all TIVO's and out-sourced TIVO service to a firm in Pennsylvania. There was only one choice for service - pay almost $100 for a complete referb. It worked for 5 more years and died when we had a power failure. I will not fix it again. I will lose my lifetime warranty.It would have earned a higher rating, but with no support from Sony, I do not feel that anyone should buy one."
5,"""Tivo changed my life!""","I literally do not know how to convey to those of you who do not already own a Tivo that it literally changed my life! This is my favorite electronic purchase EVER and probably one of my favorite things I own. You will never watch television the same way again. You always have something to watch! This is one purchase you will never, ever regret. Each and every Tivo owner I come across literally says ""It changed my life!"""
5,Incredible Music that will Live Forever,"I was only a young kid when I heard this group for the first time. Their songs where incredibly popular in Latin America and still are. While in a trip to Vienna in November 1998, I saw a huge poster announcing their concert two weeks later. I wanted so badly to stay and go to see them live. Unfortunately, I could not stay longer. At least I am happy to know that they are still around. Too bad Americans never had a chance to appreciate then more. I bought another of their CDs recently. As soon as I played a friend of mine, who is 69 years old asked who where they. He got hooked immediately. The following morning we went to the store and he bought 2 CDs. They are just great musicians. I would like to chat with fans of Boney M and exchange memories of those wonderful years in music."
3,Different styles from the Eurodisco champs,"This varied album was released following their huge success with their biggest hit ever (Rivers of Babylon/Brown Girl in the Ring) and also contains the follow-up Rasputin, which was another chart hit and dancefloor filler. It is an album of prime Eurodisco but unfortunately the rest of the tracks do not quite live up to the promise of their other albums like Love For Sale. The title track starts with a vocoder-voice counting down to a launch into a sizzling piece of synth-pop and girlie vocals. Painter Man is a nice sing-along while King Of The Road and Heart Of Gold are passable interpretations of these classic songs. Voodoonight, Steppenwolf and Never Change Lovers are just fillers. I recommend their Greatest Hits album because it contains all their best work, including the best tracks from this album."
3,Yes... Poor Sound Quality!!!,"I agree with the Mexican fan, who wrote a review below. I had bought this CD at Amazon as soon as I found it but was disappointed by its poor sound quality. No deep bass, unbalanced channel separation, etc. Luckily, I had a chance to get an original Hansa German LP a few months ago. You know what? The sound is so very much better than the CD. Actually, just perfect (also with the inner post cards and double jacket). So... I sold the CD and am enjoying the LP a lot. If you have a record player, I would recommend you to follow my example.:-)"
2,Not a good buy,I just returned this product.It made of plastic; not as sturdy as I thought. It's way over priced and doesn't function as well as I expected it to be.
3,Speedy vibrator,"The Discreet Massager is definitely discrete, looking like lip stick. It is a multi-speed vibrator which is a plus but the speed is a bit rushed feeling a bit annoying at high speed and without enough stimulaton on low speed. We've tried it only a time or two but have never finished with it."
3,Love it but...,"You can only put in 99 artist names - on a 400 disk changer, this is a BIG limitation. Don't know whether daisy-chaining another unit gives you 99 more names or not (hope so). Also, wish it let you input longer file names, and had space for track listings. Otherwise a great unit! But don't toss those jewel boxes, otherwise you'll have a hard time knowing what's playing sometimes."
2,An excellent title...,"It is an excellent title but... Paul Bowles is one of my favorite writers so I was disappointed that this, his last as far as I know, didn't live up to what I had been used to from him. For me, it just never clicked. I'll take another look at page 178 (are they all the same? opening few words may have helped...) but I doubt I'll read it again any time soon. Any of his other books would be immediately recommendable."
4,"An important book for fans, a ""so what?"" for neophites","Bowles is a great writer and he has written better books. If you are new, have heard the murmurings, and are looking to be wowed, go with The Sheltering Sky. This is not his strongest plot or his strongest batch of characters; it is slow to get going and where exactly it gets to is up for debate. But, if you want to see Bowles laying his lifelong thematic obsessions bare, this is the book. The parargaph at the top of page 178 is one of the most shockingly honest things anyone has ever written about their art, other people, the world, period. Volumes could be written eucidating the second sentance of that paragraph (Bowles himself has written a few of them)."
3,Well short of Sheltering Sky but a good read nonetheless,"I leapt upon this book when I saw it at a used bookstore, having been blown away by Bowles' pivotal work, ""The Sheltering Sky"", which would have to rate as one of the best books I have ever read. I have to say I was underwhelmed by this one - very different in tone and style, not as compulsively readable, but still a good way to pass a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. I do have to give Bowles kudos for his ability to accurately represent some of the seamier consequences that can occur when Americans are placed in unsettling surroundings and act without plan or forethought and his ability to highlight cultural differences in entertaining yet subtle ways. He is definitely a writer whose works I shall continue to seek out."
5,Frightening story but well executed,"This book scared the pants off of me! It moves so slowly that you hardly know what has happened before it's too late. I wished that there had been a place to turn around before I came to the end, much as I imagine that the characters did. There is a constant feeling of dread throughout this book. Bowles characters are refined and intelligent, but there is nothing that can prevent them from becoming prey to the evil that slowly envelopes them. Bowles is a gifted writer of prose & poetry as well as a fine musician & composer. This is no exception."
3,"not bad, but not great","Paul Bowles spent a lot of time in Morocco and, I believe, other areas of the Middle East. A long time ago, I read a book of his short stories which were based on indigenous Moroccan myths. The stories were bizarre and hard to fathom, much like what I've encountered of American Indian and other indigenous tales.When I stumbled across this book (Up Above the World), I recognized the author's name and was curious to see what other kind of writing he had done. It didn't hurt that the back cover touted Bowles as having ""undoubtedly one of the finest gifts of all men writing in English"" (St. Louis Dispatch). I was somewhat disappointed, though. The book, a tale of murder in a Central American banana republic, contains some masterful passages, but I felt the plot was rather weak. Still, it was an interesting read."
4,Pretty darned good,"I keep coming back to Souvenir in Chicago. This hanging sort of drone element that drifts over guitars and a drawn real rock-kit jam sort of thing to start, feels good and optimistic like melting snow on the first warm sunny spring day. Plenty of real instruments here. I'll be damned if it doesn't sound like one hefty dose of dare I say Sonic Youth influence. And then things degrade, then shatter as we enter Takemura's reality. As far out as it gets, it stays true, stays cohesive. Really is brilliant."
1,A huge disappointment,"Extremely disappointing.I was hoping for a book that would cast a new light on `The Aussie', perhaps giving a humurous slant on the characteristics of the modern Australian. Instead, we simply get a regurgitation of the well worn cartoon cliched image of `The Ocker Aussie', which has been written about elsewhere a million times before (ie Lives life in the Pub, has loads of mates, no respect for authority etc etc). As anyone who lives in Australia knows, these attributes belong more to myth than reality.Unfortunately, this book simply restates the stereotypical image that most foreigners already have of Australians, rather than focusing on the less well known quirks and foibles that most other Xenophobe guides manage to capture."
3,Everything you ever wanted to know about DNA,This was a good story but the main topic was DNA. I skimmed through parts of the book to get to the story I wanted to read about.
3,Meh,"About what you'd expect from a ""co-written"" book. Its F. Paul's world, but not his writing style."
1,NOT HAPPY AT ALL / DON'T USE THIS COMPANY,"THIS COMPANY SENT ME A PRODUCT THAT WAS DAMAGED, IN RETURNING THIS ITEM TO THEM I HAVE NOT HEARD OR RECIEVED ANYTHING OR ANY WORD OF ANY KIND. THIS WAS A VERY BAD FIRST TIME ON-LINE BUYING ITEM FOR ME. I FEEL USED AND VERY BAD ABOUT THIS MATTER.I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW I GO ABOUT GETTING MY MONEY BACK."
3,Don't listen to them,Look I have had one of these since 1992 and It still works fine. It does have a seven shot magazine located under the barrel. The grips can come a bit loose. What do you expect for $25? I bought it to train a gun dog and have fired hundred or rounds through it. The trigger pull is stiff because it is single action and the pull of the trigger also moves the magazine forward to the next blank. It works every time and i have never cleaned it. If you want a decent zinc metal blank gun buy it. If you want fancy movie prop spend the $100+ and get one.
5,Page turner - enjoyed it to the last page!,First book read by this author and I was not disappointed. The book caught my interest in the first few pages. Quick and fast reading - couldn't put it down & finished it in a day. The book keeps you in suspense until the end as you cannot predict the outcome - will Vivian leave Walter for good or will she go back to him & what's going to happen to the baby. Look forward to other books by this author.
5,Great Book,This was the first book I've read by Evelyn Palfrey. I loved the story and the suspense it took you through. I was hooked after the first chapter. I just couldn't put the book down. The ending was so good I had to re-read it. I thought Evelyn did a wonderful job with this book.
5,Priceless!,"This novel was an excellent read. Evelyn Palfrey has done it again.The Price of Passion made you wonder if you found yourself in the same predicament as the main character Vivian, what would you do? The story of men having outside children is so common in our community that many women simply come to accept it, but Vivian decides to take things one step farther.From the beginning until the end you will root for Vivian in the hopes that Walter, her husband gets what he deserves.You will be unable to put this novel down. Definitely a page turner. Evelyn we await your next masterpiece!"
5,The Price of Passion,"I LOVED this book. This was the first book I read by Evelyn Palfrey. I liked this story and her style of telling it so much, that I quickly found the other 2 books that had a connection with the characters in this story and read them all within a span of 3 days. I love that her characters are a little more mature than your average romance novel characters - a definite plus in my opinion. Hope there are more to come!"
5,AWESOME READ,"This book was good. I couldn't stop reading the book! Walter, man, if I was Vivian he wouldn't be alive! This was an awesome book. 5 stars!"
5,one of the best books I have read in several years,"Being in two book clubs, I do a lot of reading. If a book does not grab me in the beginning, I tend to put it down. This book got me from the page one and didn't let go until the last page.I have passed this book to at least three friends, who also have loved it."
5,Excellent! I could read it a second time and not be bored.,"Ms. Palfrey brought an excellent story to life. The book described the relationships of a mother and her child, a woman and her lover, and a wife and her husband. The writing brought to life the emotions and attitudes of all the characters, especially Vivian. Even in her trials, she triumphed."
4,Used is Good!,"Received this book in a timely fashion, arrived as expected. A little used but nothing that would disuade me from buying again."
4,A great recommendation for all my friends,This book holds your attention from beginning to end. This was the first book I have read of this author and I will be buying the rest of her books. I loved the way she gave us pieces of scenes as if in a movie. I felt like I was there with the characters as if I was actually seeing them in front of me. I also love the twists in the plot and how all these unrelated characters all come together somehow. I hated to put it down to go to work. Great job Ms. Palfrey!! I'm looking forward to reading the rest of your books.
2,too much,"The plot is interesting but there's just too much going on. First you have a domestic drama, then a mystery, then a soap opera and then back to a syrupy romance. I found it to be a bit much for one small book."
5,A Page Turner,I really enjoyed this book. I hadn't read anything from her before and I was impressed. The story line was very interesting it kept me turning the pages. And I was rooting for the lead character of the story Vivian to leave her no good husband. I was happy for her when she found someone better. The book had a good twist and turn to it. I really enjoyed her work.
4,I have the last incarnation of these speakers,"About a year ago I bought a sony three piece surround system that, as far as i can tell is identical to these speakers, save the cases. The cone sizes and max power ratings are the same and i am almost positive the responce range is too.These are pretty decent speakers, the sound from the rear speakers could be more crisp and they only go down to 85hz. but hey they are suround speakers. I am happy with these but I suspect you can get the same sound quality from a slightly cheaper KLH system. If i could do it again i would spring a little more cash for a slightly more expensive JBL system or somthing like that. dont get me wrong, these are plenty good speakers.P.s. I think the cones are paper but the darn covers dont come off. (periodicaly i enjoy taking the covers off of speakers too look at them, a slight down side to this system.)"
2,Production quality effectively counters the group's talent,"This was an unfortunate purchase for a true fan. I don't know anything about what it takes to get true sound on a CD, but apparently neither does this crew at Sony. Bring back the analog LP's. Hidden somewhere in this out of phase recording is the work of a long respected rock and roll band,but this was a pure waste of money and a lesson on listening before you buy."
5,Garlic Spread,"So glad to find this delicious product. Not available in our local stores. Adds so much to our meals!Mom always used this, so it takes me back to happy memories of my childhood!"
3,Not bad for $40,This is a great little deck for the price you pay. Sounds good. It would be a great upgrade from a deck w/o a cassette player or a broken cassette player.
4,Needs to be tweaked for a network storage system.,To sum it up: i added and deleted the program 2-3 times. the norton/symantec website was helpful. working great know. wireless updates are great. incremental updates less time for updates.
4,What a BackUp prgram should be,"This program is simple to install and easy to use. My last backup program was very confusing, and their tech support was not available to me when I needed them the most. From what I can see, I shouldn't have that problem with Norton's support. My first backup ran flawlessly and it was so much faster than my last program. I am very satisfied so far, and ordered an additional copy for my netbook."
1,Disk-to-Disk Backup useless,"I wanted a simple way to clone my laptop drive to an external drive so that in the event of a failure, I could simply swap the drives. The software seemed to work just fine and gave no error messages. I swapped drives to test and guess what, I was unable to logon to Windows. It would prompt me for my password and then say ""logging off"". I have used shareware software that worked better, albiet slower. I would not recommend this software for anyone looking to perform full didsk-to-disk backups."
4,Classic book in facsimile,"As the other reviewers put it, a classic. Well worth the price! My only comment is this facsimile edition is a scan of the original (not reset). Some of the formulae are small and not as clear as I wish-there is extensive use of the Newtonian notation for derivatives. It is usually ok to read, and context helps with meaning as does a reading glass."
2,Book is good the print out is terrible,"I am writing to alert buyers that the quality of the printout is very poor. It seems to be a xerox of the original material and in many parts you can not see what is written. Watch out.Concerning the book itself, it is a classic and need no more words because something is classic due to its content and quality."
2,"Very nice music, could do with a better performance","Here are two really great pieces from the American Romantic period. The Gilbert more overtly American than the Chadwick, but both are absolutely worthwhile. In Gilbert we can hear the predecessor of Ives, in that he takes American folk music and fashions it to his own idiom.The Chadwick is more influenced by the Germanic tradition, although here too we can find the seeds of American classical music.Both pieces, however, suffer from a far from ideal performance. Both are taken from a live concerts, with problems of ensemble, intonation and background noises quite apparent.But the Chadwick really suffers from tempi that are almost consistently too slow. The opening Allegro grazioso is and Allegretto at best, the Andante goes towards and Adagio and the third movement is hardly a minuet (even though it starts out fine!). Only the last movement really takes of immediately and makes for a fine close of this recording."
5,A great buy,"This is a great CD. perfect for that time alone with your girl. It's a very relaxing, and exciting CD all in one. i don't know about the dude below me who cried. but it's definitly worth the few bucks I bought it for. A must have. I garuntee you'll get some to this soundtrack!"
4,Weird!!,"It's kinda weird how it says its been released today but i've had it for about a year now, hmmmmmm, it's all acoustic, good cd get it, if you like there other stuff."
5,gives me the chills,"I must agree with a review below....Chris puts Chris Carraba to shame with the true power with his emo songs on this cd. ""I'm Sorry I'm Leaving"" is a very powerful song with very deep lyrics. If you have a couple bucks lying around, I would recommend it to anybody."
3,sony CDP-CX235 200 DISC MEGA CHANGER,"The product was not packaged well; only paper was tucked around it, so left too much room for the disc player to move around. When we hooked it up, it worked with one disc in it. When I filled the player, it would not adjust to play. So, I tried putting the discs in skipping every other space that holds a disc----that worked. I don't think I would order from this company again."
1,Cheap but failed,One cartridge started working for a little bit but then started printing light grey. The 2nd cartridge wouldn't pass the alignment and couldn't be used.
4,Good Advice,"This book uses a simple, straightforward style that is very accessible. Certainly older readers who are worried about memory lapses can sort through the information in this small volume quickly and, along the way, find practical ways to improve memory as well as honest information about memory loss and its causes.The book is fun to read and very personal. Both authors share their own ""memory busters"" and ""going blank"" experiences. It all sounds very familiar. For a quick read, this book packs a lot of information."
2,rent the pit and the pendulum instead,"i just found this movie at the video store last night, i have been serching forever for it, i am a huge Elvira fan so i was soo excited to see it. i love her first movie it was awesome, this one however really depressed me, it started out okay i thought (promising) but once they get to the castle it totally just follows the exect same story of vincent price's, the pit and the pendulum! not kidding pretty much every detail was there they just added Elvira! i know it was a homage to him but i think it was a rip-off! (i am also a huge vincent price fan)i am sorry but you should just rent the pit and the pendulum its alot better. sorry Elvira but this movie stunk!"
3,A burlesque of several famous horror movies,"This program is an intentional burlesque of several famous horror movies and actors. It is much less intellectual and more physical compared to the previous Mistress of the Dark movie. That is, it is more like Benny Hill and less like Monty Python. Gratuitous sex is as frequent as gratuitous violence in a James Bond movie. Elvira frequently gets her chest contacted by people's faces and hands. For me the best part of the video was the interview with the actress who to me is more appealing than the character she plays."
3,HEEEEERE'S JOHANN!,"The mildly crude pun in the title is indicative of the humor contained in this film. The humor relies mostly on corny jokes, slapstick, and jokes about Elvira's chest and sexual appetite. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) shows off her cleavage and unfortunately her age, reminding me of a combination of Mae West and Cher.Elvira and her traveling companion (Mary Jo Smith) end up in a castle where they pay tribute to a couple of Poe tales. The film is dedicated to Vincent Price who performed those tales rather well. Adrian, The stable man (Gabi Andronache) voice was terribly dubbed as part of the humor.The humor is aimed at male adolescent. I found the humor to be to stale and corny to be funny.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Elvira gets groped a bit."
3,Elvira's haunted hills,"Being a fan of Elvira, loved Elvira mistress of the dark, not being familiar with old Roger Korman(Corman) movies, I first thought is was a bit cheesy, but once I saw the commentary, I understood the concept of the movie and improved my opinion, it has some laughs, and funny dirty song called "" Le music hall"" I bought it on itunes of course."
1,AWFUL,"There were three, maybe four gags in this new movie that made me laugh out loud. But the empty space, and the stale jokes made this a real stinker. The only shining light in this whole movie was Elvira herself...that is...when they actually put the camera on her, and Elvira's interaction with ZouZou, her french maid. The acting was bad, the editing was atrocious, and I found myself squirming in my seat, waiting for this to be over.Please do yourself a favor and do not buy, rent or watch this movie for you, your mother, or your gradeschool teacher. The first Elvira movie will always remain a classic. Don't sully its memory with this."
5,Awesome well worth waiting for,Fantastic. I could only hope for something this good from her and everyone else involved. Originally I watched the first movie of hers when I was a teenager and the panache of her acting style always emphasized the wonderful writting. This is a delightful homage to all the old horror's I loved as a kid and still love today.I can only hope to express thanks to her and everyone involved for a delightful movie.
1,Elvira's Haunted Hills,"I was very anxious to watch this and it said it was CC but it was not. ANYONE WHO IS DEAF, Don't buy this it is not CC!!!"
3,"This Movie Was Okay, Her First One Was and Is The Best!","I did not like how this movie was set back into the 1850s. I mean I thought that her movie would continue as if in the year 2000. I was kind of dissapointed with the lack of humor as in her first movie and the acting of the other characters (except ELVIRA) was not very good. She still had her witty, sexy and clever one-liners which I did enjoy but I felt that the movie needed to be more modern. She definitely still looked the same back in the 1980s (Very Nice). But I still think that it could have been better...Sorry Cassandra."

3,You can't help but love her,"I love Elvira, but this movie isn't one of her best efforts. She is fun and delightful through the whole thing, but the script is very weak. She has the best lines and is quite hilarious herself. Take this movie for what it is worth, goofy, silly fun and don't look for anything deeper."
5,Enchanted Mistress,"She is Funny, Cute and Sexy in this movie.She plays the Heroin in the show.She's always Good, and involved."
3,made for you....if youre 13,"I must disclose that I love Elvira, and admire Cassandra Petersens professionalism, so keep that in mind judging this review.If you loved Elvira mistress of the dark, and were expecting the same thing, then you might be disappointed, because this is a lower budget film for a younger audience. Judged by those standards, this film delivers. If you liked Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein when you were a kid, then you will enjoy this film if you watch with the same eyes. It's not sophisticated, its not high art, but it does have obligatory boob jokes, and a charming lame humor to it. A 13 year old boy would love it, a 13 year old girl would understand it, and a older person will find it non challenging with 1940s sophistication. If you want to ""get"" this film, turn the color off on your tv, leave your pretensions at the door, and don't feel the need to justify your laughter."
3,Rent it before you buy it,"This movie is somewhat funny and you do see a lot of Elvira's ""twin peeks"", but it is not as great as her previous movie Mistress of the Dark. Mistress of the Dark is a cult classic and its worth purchasing, but this hunted hills movie is laying right on the borderline."
3,EL Parodies Price,"if you saw the Vincent Price/Roger Corman films The House of Usher, The Pit and the Pendulum and The Tomb of Ligea, you have the basic idea of Elvirs's Haunted HillsThe laughes are few and so far apart that wonder when the comedy comes. Elvira is in her baudy, busty best. however her one liners seem stale in this comedy. Elvira is in Better form here than she was in her previous film, Elvira Mistress of the DarkRocky Horror Picture Show's Richard O'Brien whines and mugs for the camera too much as he plays Lord Vladimere Hellsubus.The supporting cast of semi unknowns ham it up for camera with bit gags that are hit or miss.If you like good satire mixed with bad one liners, this piece is for you. Vincent Price, who was a friend of Elvira, must be rolling in his grave..laughing at this send up of his workBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,Not the best collection,Difinitely not the best collection from Clint Eastwood.I gave 2 star for good video transfer and Eastwood incredible acting.I am a huge fans of Eastwood.
1,Picture goes up and down in clarity,"Sir,The dvd purchased from you does not run regularly as the colour goes up and down in clarity. I dont know why it is like that. I have also played it on my PC and the result is the same.Please confirm whether you can help me in this amtter.Suresh."
5,Great collection for the price,"This is a great collection for any fan of the Clint Eastwood westerns. No frills, no extra features, so if that's what you want, look elsewhere. Otherwise, great bargain!"
5,Clint Eastwood great,I get these dvd's for my 17 year old grandson. He loves Clint Eastwood. Amazon is a great place to order movies. They are very prompt with their delivering.
4,Some good westerns.,High plains drifter is clint as his best. Two mules is a very good movie and Joe Kidd had promise but was very cheesy..
4,great price!!!!!!!!!,Solids movies for a great price. Are you kidding me!! Just get them. It's a no-brainer. You'll have nothing to complain about if you get them.
1,Microarray Analysis is a misleading title,"This book by Schena is not analytical in the rigourous sense. No mathematical methods are discussed other than in passing. Rather it is wide ranging, unfocused and occasionally comical. For example Schena begins the Preface with absurdly off topic quotes from Picasso and Neitzche and name drops throughout. Schena (or his publisher) even claims to be the ""Father of Microarray Technology"": a bold title that properly is shared between Patrick Brown and Steve Fodor. Schena digresses into such irrelevancies as defining the Internet and the value of Venture Capital. The book is quite uneven, it goes in depth on the specific chemical issues relevent to cDNA arrays and is very shallow on normalization clustering and stat. level analysis. I found the book entertaining, but I doubt that was Authors intent. Also I should note I was given the book as a gift. I can't imagine paying for it."
2,wrong picture for item,i needed the exact pulley thats shown on the picture but when it was delivered i got a total different one. its still fits my ride but not for the specific pulley i need so i'll just install it anyways i will just have to go back and find the actual pulley i need
5,Dayco pulley,Dayco makes good stuff. Dayco 89006 is a smooth pulley. No hardware included; use your existing.They also have a great website which allows you to look up the correct part number for your vehicle. Do not rely on distributor's stock photos and stock descriptions when ordering anything. Get the part number from the manufacturer.
3,Amazon needs to correct this item description,"This idler pulley fits a large number of applications, but I really question Amazon's description. The Dayco site lists the 89006 pulley as a correct fitment for my 2006 Taurus and describes it as all steel and without flanges or ribs, with a matching photo and the dimensions 90mm diam.x 30mm wide x 17mm ID. Amazon gives no dimensions and describes the pulley only as of ""glass-filled polymers"" with a ribbed, flanged, and spoked plastic pulley shown, saying it does not fit my car. Either Amazon has the wrong Dayco part number or the wrong description. We shall see when my order arrives.UPDATE: Received this pulley and it fits my 2006 Taurus perfectly, just as Dayco had said. The item description, photo, and fitment listing are all in error. Wonder how many of these Amazon will have to accept for return because of the incorrect information."
5,"Direct replacement for '94 Astro with ""w"" engine a/c","Purchased 2 of these for my '94 Astro van. This pulley replaces the idler and the belt tensioner pulleys perfectly. Took me maybe 10 minutes to swap out. My local shop wants $179 to replace both, saved a ton of $$$ doing it myself. Great product."
3,TOO MUCH MONEY FOR WHAT YOU GET,IT'S OK BUT NOT WORTH $25. THE DUSTPAN DOESN'T ADJUST RIGHT AND THEY DON'T PICK UP ALL THE CRUMBS.
2,Toy Broom,This thing is ok maybe for the movie usher to pick up small bits of popcorn but even for that it would not be my first choice. Its simply a toy.
2,"Not really a ""travel"" dryer.....","This dryer was much larger than I expected. It is heavy and takes up a lot of room when packing. And, the ""twist"" handle is a bit of a challenge too. I would not recommend this product."
3,"Nice, but monotonous.","The initial tune is nice and catchy, but the rest of the tracks are not that much different, with the exception of some unusual varaiety.Would of paid 1/4 of the price, for just having the initial track."
3,"Nice, but monotonous.","The music is good, but I expected something a bit more ecclectic.The tracks seem to report the same style, over and over.The composer is unique, but far from genius.I think that greater variety would of made the music more amicable."
3,Dont GET THIS VERSION OF THE BOOK,"first, i would like to say that this book is awesome.However, there are two versions of this book. this version (published in January 2006) has thinner paper than the other. The other book has the same cover, same everything, BUT the quality of the pages being printed.Bottomline: get the other book listed (which is published in October) over this one."
1,HORRIBLE CD PLAYER!,"If I could have given it ZERO for a star I would have. Purchased as an xmas gift and it skipped, and skipped.....and did I mention it SKIPPED? We returned it hoping it was a fluke, and the next one worked for a day then the volume went on it. Great price, good concept with the mp3, cdr/rw......but TERRIBLE cd player. Returning it for a Sony Walkman."
1,Dissatisfied,"I bought this player a couple of years ago.It's skipping, and when it does, it makes a loud high pitch noise.The tool I used to RIP MP-3s (Audio Catalyst) doesn't work anymore, so I created MP-3 CDs with CDex, they play fine on the computers, on my home entertainment center, but this portable player wont play them. It jumpss from one track to the next w/o playing anything"
3,Decent CD Player,"Before buying this cd player two years ago, I wasn't expecting much out of it. All I needed was an inexpensive device that would provide me with music daily, and that's exactly what this is. The price is nice and affordable, and the mp3 playability is a handy idea, although I do not use it. It does take quite a while for the actually cd to start playing, but other than that the tone it carries out is clear. My classic has taken a handful beatings, being dropped once or twice and being hauled onto the floor while in my backpack. From those experiences, the lid of the player has become somewhat loose. I would not recommend this item if you plan to go jogging or biking with it, because I must admit that it DOES SKIP when the player is moving up and down. Other than that, the Classic cd player is pretty decent. I plan on buying a Sony in the future, just for a fresh look and more effects."
3,Not bad,Its not a bad piece for the price - i use it all day for all the music i need - and it works fine. There was no problem till now just that batteries go out very fast but thats the case with any CD player i suppose. It takes considerable time for figuring out the type of disk before it starts playing - this can be little annoying some times. My piece fell down a couple of times - but still is working fine. I dont jog with this piece but then it does skip tunes some times for no reason but not very frequently.All in all - its not a bad bet for the price.
3,Content bordering on hentai,"This one is definitely not for kids. 17++ for sure. Further, the animation is a little rough."
3,Not that Great,"Went to the show, Pearl Jam played a short set, didn't seem into it, and stangely rushed through songs, maybe they were tired, or had someplace to go. They left out Jeremy & Alive, which are staples of their concerts. I've seen Pearl Jam many times, this was the weakest show of theirs I've ever seen. Although, Eddie Vedder did walk onstage before Sonic Youth came on, and before 3/4 of crowd were even in their seats, and did a really cool acoustic song, forget what it was, but they didn't put that song on the CD. With so many of these CD's, you can eliminate this one, & the 24th show as well. The Jones Beach show on the 25th is the one to get. It figures I would go to the worst of the three shows."
3,I've seen and heard better...,"Being a regular Pearl Jam concert-goer, I can say with assurance that this show was certainly not their best by any means. I was at the show.. it was FREEZING cold, dark, rainy, and dreary. Any band on Earth would have a rough time overcoming those conditions. Eddie was sporting a pretty ugly beard... also, I had my winter jacket on, in AUGUST! It had to have been in the 40's. It was a bad experience and it's a concert I'd rather not remember--unlike the Randall's Island show of '96."
3,a favorite opera with an old and inconsistent performance,"I had the privilege of being part of a cast of this opera at Indiana University of Pennsylvania in the late 70's, directed by the avuncular Herbert Wildeboor (since deceased). I've always loved the 7/8 hymn at the end of the first act. However, this performance is very uneven, including generally unfortunate singing by female leads, and bad acting (at least) by the person singing Reverend Parris. Reverend Hale and John Proctor are consistently good. And the orchestra parts, very demanding, are well handled. It astounds me that there is no new recording in all these years. I've since seen it done in Pittsburgh and know it's being done somewhere on the West Coast. While Mr. Ward's music is considered cliche by some, I prefer it much to, for example, Moore's Ballad of Baby Doe. Perhaps my affection for it is due to having the opportunity to perform it."
5,Makes my sound more even,At medium tension my A is louder than the fourth position A on my D string. This light tension string helped until it broke. I'll experiment with a few other lights before I buy this one again.
3,"Sort The Errors,Count the Errors",Antenna Impedence Matching is well written and matched to its target audience.The problem is errors. The book contains four full pages of misprints (errors). The complete list of errors in the front of the book causes problems all the way through. The use of graphs is excellent. The charts are helpful.The reader can learn to match an antenna using this book. Publications from the ARRL are always a bargin. If you buy this book keep your eyes on errata.
2,A bit disapointed.,I was a bit disapointent in the book. I thought it could have covered more. It is only 190 or so pages of real material. It does not cover nearly enough about cookies or session management.
1,A Ska band that hates Ska?!,You know I was considering buying this cd until I heard the last song on the cd
2,Died after a 10 months,"I was fairly happy with this product until it died after having owned it for about 10 months. At first, I noticed that the fan stopped working, and then the unit would shut down by itself 5 minutes after turning it on. I opened it out of curiosity and noticed a capacitor had burned inside (looked like popcorn). Not sure what to think of a product that died so quickly. Maybe it's just an isolate incident but I guess it's still worth sharing. Good luck!"
2,Good for the money if not using HDMI Input,"I purchased this product a few weeks ago at a retail store for three reasons: (1) it had an HDMI input for my HD Tivo, (2) it was XM ready and (3) it had an iPod cable hookup. Unfortunately, the HDMI input worked for about a week and then I started having problems with my Tivo working through the input. It worked fine if I hooked it directly to the TV. I updated the Samsung firmware, but that did not help. I am likely going to return the home theater system and try something else. Otherwise, the upconvert DVD player worked well, the sound for movies, XM radio, and CDs was solid, but there was not much in the way of changing the audio settings and controlling the subwoofer. For some reason, there is also not AM available. For $300, I guess I should not expect much."
2,Not working from Day One,"I brought this product for Christmas and it keeps shutting down after playing for approximately 1 hour. I tried contacting Samsung but to no avail. I got this system on the Dec 22 2008, and to date I have not been able to contact Samsung. It is totally frustrating and am very sorry I purchased this item."
4,Great sound but some problems...,"HDMI is very problematic, you can not watch TV and listen to the radio at the same time even if you use Component instead of HDMI cable on your cable box. Also, the DVD DOES NOT UPCONVERT like some similarly price models. And I noticed a lot of DVD copies don't work even with component. There is no AM reception either. On the plus side the sound is amazing with CD's, FM or Ipods and the DVD picture although 480p only is very clear."
4,Home Theater,I love this unit. Other than a small glitch that causes me to have to turn it off and on sometimes when switching between HDMI and regular channels this is a great unit. Good sound at low decibal and nice solid bass filled when cranked. Excellent for an avereage sized living room.
4,Great Sound,"I purchased this home theatre in a box for the receiver only. I run a full 5.1 set of JBL professional speakers and needed a receiver capable of giving them the power they need. The wattage output of the receiver sounds great and has plenty of options to customize the sound field for your specific room. I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the limited number of inputs caused me to give a 4. Overall, if you are looking for great sound for not a lot of money, this is the product to get. I have heard the sound out of the speakers that come with this system and they do sound good."
2,Nice when it works!! Using HDMI FORGET IT!!!!!!,"I've had this item Three weeks now, and have finally come to the conclusion it is not worth the hassle. The system is unstable when using HDMI cable. I can never tell if my speakers will work when turning the unit on. I've had Best Buy installers out three time, and everytime the problem is fixed for a couple hours, but as soon as I turn the unit off the problems happen all over again. I GIVE UP, unit is going back to 9/17/07."
5,"If you only take one reference to your test, take this","I used this book along with the practice problems in preparation for the Mechanical PE test. Brought a few other books to the test, but probably could have gotten by with just this.Use the same books in the test as you do in practice. You'll know where to find info."
1,Horrible Review Manual,"I would be embarrassed to put my name on this book. The layout of the book is completely out of order, who starts an engineering review with Fluids and doesn't cover the very basics of Statics until section 43? I understand that this is not a novel and doesn't need to read like one, but some logical flow of material would be nice. It would also be helpful if the review problem book that goes with this manual used equations out of this manual. At least 1/4 of the problems use formulas that seem to have come out of thin air. Oh yeah, ideal gas law pv=Rt is nowhere to be found in the entire book. How this manual became the standard is beyond me. Maybe there is nothing better out there, but I'm certain that there is nothing worse. Hopefully Mark's will get me through the exam next month."
5,A very good PE reference.,A bought this book for PE review and exam. This is a great book and all ME's should have it.
3,Nice but written a bid redundantly,"I like this book overall. It is very well organized, indexed, and contains just the right depth of information to act as a reference. The practice exam based on this book is way harder than the real thing. I would definitely recommend it as a reference. For studying, I think it has too much depth - you will end up spending way more time than needed and be over-prepared. You are better off taking a prep class at a local universityI bought this book near the end of my study for the PE exam - about a month before the test. However, it made looking up information so much easier than my other references, that I used it as my primary reference during the exam (along with Machinery's Handbook, and notes from a preparation class)."
3,"Great book, bad binding","The book is excellent, but the physical quality of the bound text is not good. I bought the 11th edition. Admittedly, it was used; but it was in excellent shape. Almost immediately the pages began falling out. Eventually they fell out in clumps.I think that PPI should publish the book in sections rather than as one giant text. I'm sure that a large book places greater stress on its pages than does a smaller one.This book is relatively expensive. It is a fact that many of my engineering books have fallen apart and others, used an equal amount, did not. It must have to do with the quality of the binding.I'd rather pay another $25.00 for the book and not have it disintegrate."
5,Mechanical Engineering Reference Manual for the PE Exam 12th Edition by Michael R Lindeburg,"I bought this book for my husband. He is pleased with the book, and says that it meets all his expectations."
1,Bad drive,"Don't buy this drive! I bought it because I got a good price on it and it has a sleek look.It worked for a couple hours then died basically. Data couldn't be copied to it. Restarted everything and it is no longer being recognized. Tried 2 other computers and it doesn't work.Tried Seagate's troubleshooting tips and to no avail. Based on their customer service's reputation, I am just gonna return this waste of a cruddy thing. Buyer beware..."
1,MAC USERS BEWARE!!!!!!,"The problem with this drive is the automatic spin down setup. For some reason, it sometimes appears to mount and other times, not. You can see it in the system profiler but it does not mount. Rather odd. Seagate technical service is severely lacking for MAC users and the forums are not helpful at all.The best advice received was to crack the case open and dump the drive into another external case (cost ~$15-$30 for a case). I hope to do this and see where we go with the drive since I do not want to throw away 750 GB!UPDATED- I did the above and took the drive out. Using a Macally Storage EnclosureMacally G-S350SUA Hi-Speed eSATA/FireWire/USB2.0 Storage Enclosure for 3.5-Inch SATA HDD, I now have a functional external hard drive. NEVER WILL I BUY SEAGATE AGAIN!!!"
5,everybody love it,"i love it. works great, very fast. everybody love it. some people asked me to recommend where to buy it."
1,"Stay away, far away. 2 drives, neither lasted a year. eSATA didn't work.","I bought two of these about a year ago. They look pretty, but...Drive 1 & 2: I got these for eSATA speeds. eSATA could not be made to work (Seagate technicians agreed)Drive 1 & 2: They run incredibly hotDrive 1: Failed in a few weeks, rec'd replacement.Drive 2: Failed after 9 months (disk crash)Drive 1: Failed mysteriously today (you can see the small internal light registering the attempt to start, but the drive does not start up)To add insult to injury, I did not pay attention (my bad) to the fact that these drives don't have power switches (they have a press area to start them if they quiesce) and, since they are not recognized as ""on"" about half the time, I had to use the power cords to stop/start them so that they would be recognized upon power-up.I am so irritated I don't even want replacements. My more recent large drives are Iomega - go there instead."
4,nice external storage solution,"although I did not buy my FreeAgent from Amazon.com, I wanted to leave a little positive feedback on a pretty decent external drive.The only reason I did not give 5 stars, is because I think the drive base is too narrow; and when my two cats are wanting attention, they start running around my computer area, and I'm afraid they might knock the drive over.So, other than the base being a little small, I think the drive works for me and my needs rather well. I had hoped the Firewire transfer rates would be faster, but this is not a really big problem.I use the drive to archive my various media files and when it comes time to burn any data, I take the extra precaution and temp. copy the files involved to an internal drive, and burn from this temp directory.I have this drive connected to a WinXP PC P4 3.2ghz system using an Intel 865 based chipset (on board Firewire,etc.)"
2,My FreeAgent has problems,"I purchased the drive and immediately saw some funny things happening on my USB and 1394 busses, which were working just fine before that. Then the Seagate drive started disappearing from the computer altogether. Sometimes it was missing folders, sometimes it was Windows ""delayed write"" errors and sometimes it just wasn't there in My Computer. After a poor customer tech support call (they told me just to reformat the drive) I finally figured that the problem seems to be heat related. When I use the drive for extended periods it heats up and starts failing. If I turn it off for some time it seems to be fine again. Ug. Hope that sending it in will achieve a better result!I have always trusted Seagate with our high end drives, especially in my servers. Now, I really have second thoughts!"
1,Touch-sensitive power button doesn't work,"This is my second Seagate FreeAgent Pro 750GB drive- the first one wouldn't turn on, I had to unplug and replug the power cord to turn it on. Amazon cheerfully replaced it and the replacement has the same defect. Amazon declined to replace it a second time and has offered a refund, and as soon as I figure out what to buy so that I can transfer the data I'm going to take them up on it. I also have the previous Seagate model with the blue light pushbutton on the front and have been very pleased, but unfortunately it's not available."
3,Seagate 750 GB external hard drive,"This hard drive works great with my Mac OS X 10.6. It was great for clearing up my machine so I could put more school documents on it. I moved all of my music and movies onto the hard drive, and even synced my iTunes library to it to save even more space on the laptop. This machine runs very smoothly. I can't hear a thing from it no matter how long I've got it hooked up. It does, however, become extremely hot. I had to put it on the floor for fear that it would ruin the finish on my desk, and then put it on a cooking rack after the carpet became too warm to touch.Other than the exceedingly high heat energy output, it is easy to work with, has a nice, sleek design, and operates quietly.I'd rate this item 4 stars except that I'm not sure the heat problem isn't a fire hazard."
1,Save your data somewhere else,My drive had problem to read and save data after serval months.Tried to send it back to seagate for RMA.But they returned it without repairing because of slightly damage to the case during the shipping.I am lucky since i didn't save too much and important data to the drive.
1,"This hard drive is very unreliable, software is hard to find, mine conked out",I was using this for karaoke software and it burnt out.Don't use this drive or even think about buying it.
1,Stay away....,"I was very disappointed with this item. It died within 2 weeks of delivery. I was not able to RMA this item because it held about 400GB of my backup data. I needed to send out of state to get recovered. When returned back to me, it was too late to return to Amazon. Purchasing this item actually cost me about $1000 in data recovery fees when it died on me Save your $$$ buy something else."
4,Hot drive,This is a very nice drive. Do not buy if you plan to let it run all the time. It will get very hot and fail in a few months. I only power mine up to actually use it. The power button is different. Just put your finger on it and wait until the power comes on. The same to power it off. I use Norton Ghost to back up my hard drive and it works great.
5,Seagate External Drive,This hard drive is one of the best ones I have bought. Seagate continues to shine with the quality of their products. great b\uy
4,Pretty good,"I use this drive for backup of my PC files. I do a backup once or twice a week. I've had the drive for about a month, and so far works fine for backup. It's suppose to be in sleep mode when it's not being accessed, but one day it came out of sleep mode even though it wasn't being accessed, and the power button did not work to turn it off. I ended up having to pull the power plug to turn it off. Now, I keep the drive powered off when it's not in use. The power button works most of the time. I use Windows Vista backup software, and the connection is USB."
4,Great selections with some rarities,"I got this CD way back in the 90s. It had some songs I had never heard before, like Queen's Thank God It's Christmas, A Spaceman Came Travelling, Christmas Time is Here and Christmas in Kings Cross. It also has familiar ditties by Wham, Elton, the Beach Boys and Bing. Nice variety with some stuff that might be new to you."
4,The Answers,"Rick Warren writes in a straight-forward manner, referring to scripture that applies to common problems many of us face in life. He uses everyday language to explain what the Bible says. He gives an uplifting approach to defeating depression, stress, discouragement, loneliness, and other types of life crises."
4,A Great Resource,"This little book is one I'll read again and again. I keep thinking of people I want to have it, so I'll probably buy some as gifts."
3,Ugly & useful,"Overall, a good book. Lots of good ideas. Thing is, this book could be much better. Style is its biggest enemy.See, this is not literature. Trying to be the ""Chuck Palahniuk"" of the corporate or branding world is just nonsense and this book is in dire need of a better style and a better look. Picking the wrong fonts, using too many capitals, too many exclamation points and waaaay too many suspense points is just... ... ... ANNOYING!!! (Sorry, I can't pick the wrong fonts for this review, exaggerating with suspense/exclamation points was the next best thing available.)"
2,"Rah Rah, not How-to","Professor Peters is/was a Harvard professor of business who concentrated on researching and teaching competitiveness. I liked his serious books and text books. He's a really high energy speaker and has a quite lucrative business in coaching. Therefore, I should not be surprised that this little book is full of gimicky fonts, colors, buzz words... and is closely associated to the sales-oriented web site of the same name. Maybe there's good content there, but the presentation screams: motivational, not content-rich. And that's what I think the book is good for."
5,Tom Peters GETS IT...so GET this book,"A small colorful book...lots of red boldface and different size fonts...which cynics will cheerfully dismiss as mere ""sizzle."" But Tom Peters provides lots of steak to go with the visual sizzle in this very important book. An easy to read (and carry!) book filled with great ideas to transform semingly mundane work into work that M-A-T-T-E-R-S as Tom writes. You simply will not be the same person on the job if you take Peters' concepts and advice to heart. My simple .02: read this book, then the Project 50 and RUN WITH IT."
1,Broken Record of Ideas,"Tom has a lot of great ideas re-packaged in this rather unconventionally written book. Too many ""WOWs"" and fragmented sentences makes one perceive him as the ditzy cheerleader. Save your cash. The book's size tells it all."
1,Don't purchase,This book is not what I expected and I don't recommend it to anyone! It' gets at least one start rating because I couldn't post this message without marking a star.
2,"Content good, presentation desparately lacking","Tom's ideas and thoughts about the demise of the ""employee"" model and the re-emergence of the ""independent consultant"" are right on target. He correctly projects the most forward moving managerial trends and thinking. The presentation, though, is sorely lacking. The book's partial sentences, choppy writing, random capitalization,and arbitrary use of bold type, different size types and indents were so distracting it was hard to remember what the heck I was reading about. I also wonder about writers that feel the need to promote their message with the use of four letter words--is the content not enough to sell the work and make the point? For those that haven't heard this message before this book is probably worth reading. If you can handle a more comprehensive (and longer) book I think there are probably other, better choices."
2,"Reasonable Thesis, HYSTERICAL PRESENTATION","The point of this book is that you are a brand. The possibility of having a very long term job with one company that defines you career is very small. For this reason you need to evaluate what your skils and interests are and market them, network, and promote yourself as the brand behind the 'WOW' projects you've worked on.This strikes me as resonable though it's pretty generic.Reading the book seems like it'd be a lot like seeing Peters in person on stage. It's got an evangelist style, catchphrases like 'WOW' project, BRAND YOU!, etc.Here's a representative quote, 'Set up a Freak Collection section in your Rolodex. Add to it. Consciously. Constantly. Nurture it. Concsiously. Constantly.' The book is about 200 pages of that. (IMHO: BRAND YOU 50 = CAPITALIZATION + REPETITION + GENERIC OBSERVATION.) If you need a shot of enthusiasm about branding yourself, this book might be for you. If you are looking for more substantive reading, look elsewhere."
1,Strange Writing Style,"Because the author has such an oddball writing style, I couldn't get past the first three pages."
5,One of my top 10 business books,"This small book, one of a trilogy called Reinventing Work, offers fifty tools for becoming a ""brand,"" whether as an entrepreneur or as an employee. It's on my top 10 list of recommended resources in my book The McGraw-Hill 36 Hour Course in Business Writing and Communication."
2,Very Hard To Follow,"I love Tom Peters. He is truly a genius when it comes to Management topics. However, I found this book almost unbearable.Tom writes this book as if he is going in so many different directions at any one given time. For me, it was presented in a incredibly staccato fashion. It is as if there was no one single thought longer than one or two sentences long, and then it immediately went into a different direction. I like books that flow, and this one, for me anyway, did not flow at all.I will continue to read Tom Peters. However I will definetly preview any book from him before I decide to buy."
4,"Wacky, irreverent, and insightful...","As a business communications speaker and lifelong student I characterize this one as Sales and Marketing because it is completely and totally about selling yourself through proper self-positioning in whatever marketplace that you operate. Typical Peters, weird graphical text layout and dynamic writing have you hearing Tom bounce off the walls with enthusiasm, providing valuable ideas and attitudes on the most important product going--YOU! Live with the weird writing style if it bothers you, because the ideas are sound."
1,Sizes are Wrong,"At first my wife ordered two womens smalls. They were much too small. I mailed them back, at my expense, to exchange for mediums. These were too tight around the waist and too wide in the shoulders. It's not worth my effort to return them for credit."
5,Stay warm,"This is a must for anyone living in a temperate climate. The shirt fits snug, so you don't have to worry about it being bulky and the ""V"" is wide enough that you could wear a V-neck sweater over it and it stays camouflaged. Also, the fabric is smooth, so you don't have to worry about trying to yank something on over it; the outer layer just slides right over it. Keeps you nice and cozy. The pants are wonderful too!"
5,The best of fit,I have tried many eithers but I always come by to cuddl Duds. They are light and have a perfect fit.They are very warm without the heavy weight.
3,SATIN not silk,"This top has a nice soft feel and washes well. My only complaint is that the top is too tight and too short, and did shrink up a bit. Looking at the picture I thought it would be longer and a bit looser. I ordered size large."
2,Sleeves to long,Sleeves much longer than expected. If the shirt didn't allow push up sleeves to elbow I would return. Otherwise the top is ok
3,OK mysteries,"These are pretty run of the mill, but then, virtually all mysteries are structured in similar ways. What sets Durrenmatt apart are his characters, who are quite nuanced and full of surprises. The language is also good, and as I read it in German, not too difficult if undistinguished.Recommended if you like the mystery genre, which appeals to me only in film."
4,"Great movie, amazing picture quality",I bought this disc from Amazon on 1/18/09 and it's working fine. No playback problems at all. Looks like fixed versions are out being circulated. The video quality of this title is just outstanding. Could easily be used for demo material on a HD display. The film itself is pretty darn good too. Music choices were decent. Recommended overall.

1,Great Movie!!! Won't Play on my PS3 !!!,i watched this movie at one of the LA Premier's and it was amazing. This is one of the best movies of 2008/2009. However i am very disappointed because i bought it and it won't play on my ps3 !!!
1,defect copy which sucks how do I get a new one...,My copy played once now broken like all the data erased while I watched. How do I get a new copy amazon you can take this one and sell it to your kids as a frizbee...please someone tell me what to do...
2,Over rated....,This video is all back country.... that it.... Its the first board video I have every passed out watching.
5,That's it That's All,"This is an epic snowboard video, the quality of the video is great and the soundtrack matches with some great tunes."
5,Must See!!,If you enjoy snowboarding movies then this one is a must see!! Some very stunning visuals from the scenery and amazing talent from the riders.
5,Amazing film,"This is a fantastic snowboarding video. The the best description I can think of is Planet Earth on steroids. The scope of the visuals is mind blowing and the scenery alone could have merited an individual film. Oh yeah, and the riding was good too. Certain tricks involving the tops of spruce trees should not be humanly possible. Overall great riding, filming and soundtrack."
5,AWESOME,"I read this book 10 years ago when it was still a manuscript on my grandfather's desk, and it is still a gut wrenching story even today. Stephen Nasser, or Zaide (to me), tells this story in great detail and pure emotion. We all take for granted how fortunate we are to have some of the joys in our life, Stephen's book makes us take another look at our life and what we have, and truly appreciate what we have. He is an inspiration to myself and to my children. I am proud of the book that he has written and the fact that I have a copy to hand down to my children."
5,Extremely Moving!,"With the pleasure of having heard Mr. Nasser speak, I new that I would only benefit from reading the book. I started the book on Friday afternoon and didn't put it down. I was done by Saturday afternoon. It was extremely moving and left me smiling, crying, and soul searching as I moved through the pages. How could anyone survive such a horrible situation? What amazing strength this boy had.I would reccommend this book to everyone. I teach history and after our visit from Mr. Nasser numerous students bought the book. I found them trying to read between classes and during our silent reading time. They would talk to me before and after class about what they had read. It was obvious that this book moved them as well.Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to read this book! God Bless!"
5,Elaina Saperstein-Realtor from Las Vegas,Incredible! I couldn't put it down. This cruelty should never have happened but it did and Stephen's memories and his brother's voice will be with me forever. Thank you Stephen for sharing your story with the world.Elaina Saperstein
5,Great story,A wonderful story of human suffering and redemption. Those of us who lived through the Nazi years of WW2 can identify with the story of this young Hungarian boy.
5,Emotional and gripping,"Stephen Nassar's story of his time under Nazi captivity is truly amazing. I just finished reading this book for the second time, and found it just as emotional the second time as I did the first. I had the honor of meeting Mr. Nassar when he came to my small town to speak to our local schools. I have never seen these teenagers so captivated and quiet ever! They were absolutely spellbound by his story, and had many questions afterward. I have been very inspired by Stephen's courage and fortitude in overcoming what he went through. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
4,very interesting,This book was esay to read and very interesting. I was amazed to discover how much the prisioners had to go through. The life in the prosion camp was so harsh. Pista and his brother helped each other survive. I was so interested in Pista's life that I would like to read a book on the rest of his life.
5,"Stephen Nasser, A fine man","I heard Stephen Nasser tell his story in a lecture series in North Las Vegas, Nevada. I cried.I had to buy his book. Which made me cry.The book is an eye opening account of a holocaust survior. It is written with honesty and detail.When I feel sorry for myself, I pick Nasser's book and randomly flip the pages. I always feel better."
5,"This is a love story - brotherly love, love of family, love of life","I read this book over my winter holiday, and found myself smiling and shaking my head in wonder. I hugged my children, called my brother to remind him how much he means to me, and also contemplated the ugly side of human nature. I found myself filled with hope and inspired by the courage of the author, the kindness of strangers, and saddened by the horrors the Jewish people had to endure. I will read this to my children when they are older, and can only hope our society never has to face such ugliness again. In the end though, I could only call this book a love story. A reminder of brotherly love, young love, and the love of life. It's an amazing story, that will touch your heart, and you won't soon forget."
5,Great Book!!!,I knew it would be sad story since this is a bio of a Holocaust Survivor! The Author of the book is very clever young boy (14 yrs old) trying to survive in such cruel and harsh conditions of a Concentration Camp. This Book was so moving that I finished it in 2 days!
4,True story,"A gripping true account of the events leading up to and a boys interment in a concentration camp. Some of the events are terrifying and hard to believe, even though we know much about Nazi brutality. And there is a bit of a love store in here, too. I wish there had been a sequel to his life in America. Great book."
5,Poor Family,"Some of the scenes he describes are horrific, especially the account of the murder of his aunt's baby. He must have been very mature for his age to withstand all the abuse and maltreatment. I often wonder what goes through the minds of people who have experienced and witnessed such atrocities."
4,"Many more stories ""out there"", this is only one and should be optional for student or adult reading.","Since I enjoy any novel, fiction or non fiction with an historical themethis book was a pleasure to read."
5,Please READ,"A must read!!!! I had the privilege to listen to Mr. Nasser's horrific story in class....I encourage any age group to read this book and try to attend one of his lectures. Thank you...""Never Again"""
5,Mr. Nasser,Mr. Nasser came to our school and spoke about his experience in the Holocaust. His tale is a very moving one and his book moves you emotionally and brings tears to your eyes. It expresses the horrors of the holocaust so well and gives a first-hand account of the Holocaust.
4,School Smarts,School Smarts is a great book but if you try to buy this book or any other book from the pleasnt comupany you get ripped off. So buy this book from Amazon. This book shows you what to and say when difernt confuaions come up. But about 1/2 of the info in this book you all ready know.
3,Content vs. Style,"All the things the previous reviewer said are true. The resources in this book are wonderful and the advice from children's authors is absolutely engaging--and useful. However, the copy-editing for this book is non-existent. It is replete with grammatical errors as well as spelling errors and inconsistencies (different spellings of the same word and name throughout). I'm not one of the ""grammar police."" I can put up with a few errant typos. However, the number of errors present in this book is disturbing. I would have rated it higher for content, but, whether intentional or not, such glaring lack of editing can signal a disregard for the readership and so three stars is as high as I'll go. I hope these problems have been fixed in the paperback edition."
5,"Fantastic, heartwarming, great mix of melody","I can't believe I finally got my favorite CD. Off course, at the time I had it, it was on LP. This was in the early 1980s while I was still living in Nigeria. Boney M was so popular!. When I came to the States I left my album and couldn't get it back. This CD, with tracks like African Moon, Ride to Agadir and Breakaway, is my all time favorite. I was disappointed when I came to the States and found out that these guys were not well known. Thanks to internet technology, I now have this CD and will definetly buy more of their their music. I highly reocmmend this CD to anyone that loves music that is heartwarming, melodious, easy to listen with a variation of disco. I wish the Goup well in whatever they are doing these days.. If anyone has information about the group's current activity, please share."
5,good book,It meets the class requirements and provides good background info for family therapy. I'm only through the first 4 chapters.
2,Review,"I bought the book used and chose it because it stated it was as new with no markings. However, the book has several underlinings, stars and other notations in it. It also has dirt marks on the inside. Finally, it as labels on the front. I was disappointed with the quality of this book compared to other used books I have bought in the past."
4,new book although i bought used had some funny cutouts on cover,book cover had some minor cutouts of the publisher for some reason but were neatly covered with white stickers. I did buy this book used and it turned out to be in new condition. I'm guessing the minor damage was the reasoning for the used category--overall satisfied with my purchase. timely delivery.
1,Rating is for the Kindle edition only,"I was excited to try my first textbook on the Kindle. However, I regret the decision for two reasons. First, this book is not available for reading on Kindle for PC or Kindle for Iphone. I did not know I would not be able to read the book from all my Kindle locations. Second, several of the tables in the book are not visible, replaced by ""Text not available due to copyright restrictions."" These are tables integral to the text. Now I will have to borrow the book from a classmate or buy it to see the tables. I really had no idea that purchasing a Kindle edition of a book might entail buying a book with virtual pages torn out of it. Definitely diminishes my enthusiasm for Kindle overall."
4,Excellent textbook for advanced psychology students,"I needed to purchase this book as a textbook for a master's level psychology course. The book is well written, informative and covers many different types of family systems therapies. I intend to keep this on my professional bookshelf for future use."
1,CANNOT BE REST: BUYER BEWARE!,"This piece of junk cannot be reset once it kicks, and good luck trying to find a manual or answer online. Not worth it."
1,Beware!,"I had some of the same neg. experience as other customers. The Best Buy guys push it, but it does not live up its promise. I, too, put a small space heater in and it blew after ca. 20 min. And then I found out that the reset button DOES NOT WORK! Now, I admit, I do not know if you should not put juice hogs in, but then they should tell you!"
5,Overlooked Power Pop Gem,"Wow! I bought this CD at a discount, its one of the best I have ever heard. If the early Beatles, Elvis Costello and Squeeze had a love child band Einstein's Sister would be it. Now I've got to buy the rest of their CDs.Very catchy hooks and melodies, lead vocals....great voice!"
5,Incredible again,"Einstein's Sister takes the cake, lets you have the cake and then eat it, too! They are just the best! They're genuine--the real deal. A lot of heart goes into this music. They jam out on this album and give it their all. I would recommend this album to anyone who digs good tune-age. Awesome stuff. You need this CD!"
5,Learning Curves is like a breath of fresh air!,This record is nothing short of GREAT! Good singing and good playing. Douglas & Tucker have really blossomed on this record. It is a well balanced record which is hard to find any more. It a must to have for all
4,Couldn't put it down,"The story starts out with an attention-grabbing beginning and proceeds to take the reader through twists, turns, romance and adventure. I don't believe in reincarnation but this author had me wondering ""what if"" and ""why not?"" .... a delicious read that satisfied my taste for entertainment while educating and enlightening."
4,Brazilian rock newcomers,"Maybe one of the best releases of Brazilian indie rock in 2005 already, Phonopop's first full-length album ""Já no há tempo"" meets all the requirements for becoming a national mainstream success. Between catchy choruses (""Marina"", ""Love is Just Love""), fine musical arrangements (""Sombra da Dor"", ""Fragmento""), and mellow interludes (""Goodbye"", ""Já no há tempo""), this début evokes - without ever limiting itself or losing its own identity - The Beatles, Radiohead and Ride, and will certainly please brit-pop fans. Without doubt, a nice addition to your shopping basket."
5,Great experience!,The book I ordered arrived on time and was in great condition! I would use this seller again!
2,"A lot faster, but at a price!","Compaq is a really difficult place to get upgrade from. Tough to believe for the company that now has DIGITAL as part of it. After much research, I finally came across the Viking boards. The memory cards come in with nothing to guide you, so unless you feel comfortable opening your computer, yanking out 2 of your existing cards and installing 2 new ones, this is not for you. Between buying this extra RAM and a new hard drive I gave the old Presario maybe another year or so. If you are heavey multimedia user, this may not be enough to speed you up sufficiently. It is OK for music, web surfing etc., but too slow for the really neat stuff"
1,Waugh's Book - Waugh in Abyssinia,"I thought 'Waugh in Abyssinia' is one of the worst books ever written about Ethiopia by outsiders. From the content, one can easily see that Waugh was disposed favorably towards Fascist Italy and was constantly annoyed that Ethiopians did not treat him the way he was used to be treated in other colonized countries.He himself says that he is irritated by the average Ethiopian person who thinks he is equal to anyone in the world. Even if one considers that this was written during World War II, I find it difficult to forgive this guy for thinking so blatantly in a racist manner. The book is just a reflection of his frustration. I find it difficult that European readers continue to admire this guy.Frankly, I consider the money I spent on the book as a total waste."
2,TOO HARD TO DO,"This was the number one toy my 5.5 yr old daughter wanted for Easter. She loves playing with Mommy and Daddy's PDA and this was to be one of her own. The new color one might be better as the Barbie Black and White is too hard to see and not much fun to color. (Hmmm, shall this be black or...white?) It was also very difficult to figure out what the games were. I got her the Dino cartridge, which she did play with, but since the second day, it's been on the bottom of the toy box."
1,Bad Combo!!! Buyer Beware!,"I ordered this toy for my niece's birthday. She lives 1500 miles away. I took Amazon's combo suggestion of the Barbie Pixter and the Barbie color fashion show cartridge. Lo and behold, when they arrive, they don't even WORK together. The cartridge is for a completely different system. Now my sister has to go through a return process because of this and my niece has no birthday present. THANKS AMAZON."
2,Amazon problems,"I bought this toy for me niece. Amazon asks if i want the Color Barbie Fashion Show with it, so i repied yes. When it arrived i was disappointed to see that the the Barbie Pixter and Barbie Color Fashion show were incompatible even though Amazon pushes them. Terrible job Amazon!"
1,BOO!,"This toy sux! I stopped playing with it for 11 months and its already broken, I wouldnt recomend this toy for ayone over the age of 8, so if you wanna save ur money dont buy this annoying hideous terriblr toy~"
1,NEH!,"This is a really boring toy. I fyou still like babrbie this may be fun, but when you grow up you will hate this toy!! I recomend this to 4 year old trough 8. This toy is so boring (if u r older than 8)"
1,Not Nice,If you buy this for a Holiday and the next year the girl will be turning 9 I would not buy this toy. Say you buy this for Christmas and your daughter is 8 years old the next year she will be 9 and she will hate this toy! I got this when I was 8 but I only played with it for 2 months! I already stuffed it in the bottom of my toy chest!!By:Unanimous
3,Mower Blades,The blades were not genuine John Deere but I will try them and see how they work at least they are cheaper than John Deere.
5,Enjoyed,Liked Jeremy Marsh right off the bat. He and Lexie seemed to make the perfect couple. I love reading anything by Nicholas Sparks. Great writer.
4,Not a bad show.,"This show was broadcast on our local public T.V. channel. I imagine that was the case in many other states as well.Released yet or not, I'm guessing that many people saw the broadcast, some more than once, hence the ability to post a review like the the first person on this thread did. And for what it's worth, I agree with D.Perkins and with that review.The ""Big Banding"" toward the end was a bit much. Still, a fine show and Brian Setzer smokes on guitar...Just my opinion."
1,Blu ray,I was not aware what a blu-ray was and unfortunately this does not come out in a CD so have missed out :(
3,Les Paul Rockabilly?,"Good enough show, very good if you like rockabilly. BUT what does it have to do with Les Paul? I know Les was certainly associated with jazz (in his early recordings) , some degree of country (country swing jazz from the get go) and certainly an iconic master of pop (with Mary Ford). But I have never heard of his being associated with Rockabilly, let alone playing, or at least recording much of it. So I really do not see how these selections are the basis for a tribute to him. How High The Moon being the obvious exception."
5,FABULOUS!!!,"This is surely one of Jeff Beck's finest musical projects ever!Imelda May is an absolutely AMAZING talent...a fantastic singer & performer, as well as so easy on the eyes...;-)Their renditions of Les Paul & Mary Ford songs is just incredible...I'm sure that they would be proud!"
4,A guitar master honors his heroes,"That Jeff Beck was captivated by the guitar work of Les Paul should surprise no one. But this is not merely Jeff Beck taking on a number of classic Les Paul/Mary Ford recordings - it's a time capsule overview of how we moved through the twanging guitar work of Les Paul to Duane Eddy, rockabilly and the Ventures. Along for the ride we have Imelda May, Brian Setzer and Gary U. S. Bonds sounding as good as ever.The video includes several songs not on the CD, and the crowd includes folks like David Bowie and Paul Schafer enjoying things immensely. You'll have a very good time as well."
5,Jeff Beck is the (guitar) GOD!,"Unbelievable... I don't know how JB manages to be the best guitar player in many musical styles. He is the best guitar player and the most versatile one too.Imelda May's vocals are also true to the original and overall this concert represents the sound of the era ""very well"".Buy this DVD now, do not wait. And while you still have a chance to see JB performing this concert live (till April 9th, 2011) in US -- go get tickets for it."
5,Rock n Roll Party alright.......,"Havent watched a DVD this much since ""Live At Ronnie Scotts""; Beck continues to amaze.Plus a bonus---my wife likes it!My feelings about this are the same as all the rest of the 5star reviews.Id like to add the fact that the horn section contains some pretty heavy hitters also.Google up Leo Green,or Dave Prisman-household names in the music world,playin with just about everyone.Also we all know Blue Lou Marini from the Blues Brothers(looking a little more gray,but arent we all).Imelda May just freakin blows my mind as well.Her band is amazing.Sitting in my Lazy Boy and watching and listening to this on a fine system for 15$ is a no brainer for me and should be for anyone who appreciates fine music."
5,Excellent!,"Definitely will be watching this DVD over and over again. Jeff Beck with Imelda May and the rest of the supporting cast were totally outstanding. JB never ceases to amaze me. Excellent and really fun with I would say just about perfect performances by all. Loved Beck and Setzer's performance together with great guitar solo's back and forth. Imelda May.....sings like an angel and her husband Doug has a great voice too! Put this DVD on with your sound system with people over and they will be dancin', shakin', grinnin' and glued to the screen. What a wonderful venue to applaud the late and great Les Paul. I loved every second of this musical happening. Oh yeah....did I say excellent!"
5,Huge new fan of Imelda!,"Beck, as always, rocks, but I just discovered Imelda May and she is magnificent. I can't wait until she puts out her own DVD. Her husband is fantastic too. Excellent all around. Les Paul would be proud. RIP."
5,"This book ""gets it"" !","This book more than so many others is able to communicate complicated ideas, concepts and solutions in a way that teens can understand, without being condescending, trivial or unuseful. It covers the entire process for making films in a way that is engaging, fun and productive. My high school video students all love it, and yours will, too!"
5,The book that changed my ways,"This book is great right from the start. It is exciting, hilarious, and very useful for a upcoming movie director like myself. I laughed, I cried, and will never forget how this book helped my ideas get turned into reality.Thanks alot Clay Nichols and Troy Lanier for this book,Pete from Naples, FL"
4,Even My Tween Likes This,I have a project started with my tween daughter. It might even expand into a project with her Girl Scout troop.
5,Truly a classic,"Unless someone has changed the inside of this book, it is the same I had when I was very small, 60 years ago. It may well have been one of the first interactive books for toddlers. It has a mirror to look in, Daddy's scratchy face to feel, the bunny to pat, and I've forgotten what else. I would hate to even guess how many times our copy of that book was read. It lasted through us three girls and I was amazed to find it still mostly intact when I went home to visit, as an adult."
1,Not for beginner potty trainers!,"I think this VHS was actually detrimental to my grandson's potty training. The only use he saw for a potty chair like his was a toy bear; all the children in the tape used the big potty and were 4+ it looked like. So, back at square one where he thinks his potty chair is a toy. This VHS might be ok for bigger kids, but even then I would like to see a little less extaneous material, ie, party footage, etc."
2,Not the Best,"This has a great title, but a bad story line. Birthday parties and going to the bathroom don't mix. OK, first off, Katie, the sister of the birthday boy (Bobby, did not have a potty chair to practice on or a potty seat (the mother just got the girl trained). Next, we have Lizzie. Lizzie is about five. I did not like seeing the child pooping on the potty. (Yucky!) The clown was what our family liked the most. There really was no potty training! It was just about potty and a birthday party. I'd suggest Once Upon a Potty for the potty-training video list!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I could not believe how awful this video was - not geared at all to 1-2 year olds. My son (2) watched about 5-10 minutes and lost interest. I watched it for probably 15-20 minutes and decided that it was a complete waste of money. I am actually surprised that this video received any positive comments.
1,This one can go right down the potty for all I care!,"This video was a huge disappointment if you are starting to introduce the potty to your toddler! I have a 2 year old and the video was not engaging in the least for a child his age. The video shows ""big kids"" having a birthday party and hardly focuses on the 'potty' except for one part when all the boys at the party (who are about 4 years old) line up to go to the bathroom with a small clown...bizarre! My son stopped paying attention about two minutes into the video. I wish I could return it for a refund!"
2,Creates confusion in potty training girls,"My daughter liked the video well enough to watch it but she was and continues to be confused by the ways boys stand up to potty. It seems to focus way too much on training a boy and very little on training a girl - perhaps there should be a version for girls and boys.... Although it was entertaining for my daughter, she didn't get the gist that it was trying to teach her to 'go potty'."
5,She's a Super Dooper Pooper!,"These are the words that finally got my 4 year old to use the potty.She had been potty trained since she was 2 and 1/2 but adamently refused to do No.2 on the potty. She never had any accidents day or night, and would go get pulls up, put them on and go. (I know, your saying stop buying them) but, if she did not have them she would hold it, which would result in another trip to the doctor.After watching the video for only 3 days, she has been using the potty everyday for a week without any problems. She is so proud of herself, as are we.This is the video to buy if you have a very smart, but headstrong only child. Now I can put all the money that I would have spent on pull-ups in the college fund.Its amazing how a child can learn from singing rhyming songs and watching a video. Its the best!"
2,Not For Beginners!,"I was extremely disappointed in this video. My son is 23 months old. He enjoys watching the other children in the video as the theme is a birthday party. The video is about 25 minutes long and spends about 5 total minutes showing the ""potty"". Heavy focus on an upcoming birthday party and being a ""big boy"". The majority of the children in the video are age 4. Only one scene shows a child in diapers. All other children are in underwear and can undress and dress themselves. All ""potty"" actions are shown on a big toilet, not a small potty chair. If your child is 3 1/2 or 4 and needs some reinforcement, it's okay, but the limited potty focus makes it not worth the money as a training video. Do not buy this video if your child is a beginner. Duke Family could have done a better job by focusing on children in various stages of training and decreased the birthday party focus."
3,Songs are great but content regarding potty is only fair,"My 2 year old girl loves the songs and actually requests them when we're practicing potty use. However, most of the kids in the video are 4 years old and can already use the potty. One scene shows a younger girl (w/diaper) trying out the big potty. There's no use of a smaller potty. They do show girls and boys so that's helpful until your girl decides she wants to stand. For the songs and creating interest, I give it an A but for true potty content, I give it a B-. By the way, the songs are quite strange but cute!"
1,Very Old Fashioned,"I think that the tape was probably a very good idea, but is geared towards older children. My son is two years old, and will uset the potif you put him on the pot, but he just won't tell you when he has to go to the pot. The video was so old fashioned, that it didn't even keep his interest. The clown didn't even interest him, mind you this is from a child that looks foward to looking at Zyboo at 6:30 in the morning. Needless to say, he only watched the viedeo maybe twice, and didn't even see it all the way. I am going to get him another potty video, because this was a waste for my two year old."
3,"Not bad, but regional in vocabulary","With hummable tunes and clear descriptions, this video would be a winner, but for two faults: a bizarre break to read part of a Raggedy Ann book--hurriedly and with a southern accent, so it is almost incomprehensible to an adult, let alone a child-- and the repeated use of the word ""pee"" which may be okay in North Carolina (where this video was made) but isn't universally acceptable."
2,not that great,"I bought this video and the Once Upon A Potty video at the same time. My daughter never liked this one, I think she wasn't able to make the connection between the ""story"" about a birthday party and going potty on a potty. The other video has been used and used, in fact we have lent it to two other families. I am on this site to buy the Once Upon A Potty, Boy for my son and saw this video recommended so thought I would add my 2 cents worth. I would not recommend this video."
3,I was very diappointed in this video,"I was very disappointed in this video. Although my daughter loved the songs and the clown, there really isn't much potty training instruction for the toddler set. With the exception of one child (who did not even use a potty seat), all of the children shown were 4+ years old. While that may be fine if you are having difficulty potty training an older child, it was not helpful to me. However, this video was very good at emphasizing hygene. As I mentioned, the only toddler was shown in diapers (as opposed to panties - a big no, no for potty training!) and used a standard toilet rather than a potty seat. I ended up buying Once upon a Potty. . . .p.s. We are now successfully potty trained!"
2,Virtually USELESS,"Aimed at 4yr old Boys who already know how to potty but need some re-enforcement. Useless as a beginning potty training video. It also has this horrible ""clown"" that is in every Duke Family Series video. My little girl didn't like the video anymore than i do and she usually likes live children in videos. It also has a ""magic show"" that is almost disturbing, he even leaves the party with the boys in the middle of the show to take them to the bathroom. It's best point is; it has a catchy little tune about pulling the pants down.I do not recomend this video."
1,"Mary says, ""Disappointing""","My daughter loved this video, but she never seemed to notice the children on the potty. She loved the clown at the birthday party. Birthday party?! What does a birthday party have to do with going potty? I have to admit that the birthday boy didn't go potty, but his sister Katie did. (Katie didn't use a potty chair or a potty seat. She looked about two years old and used the toilet.) Then, it showed Lizzie who was reading and going to the potty. Eww! I didn't like the three boys going to the potty scene. Disgusting! I'm Mary and I don't reccommend this!"
2,MOM's Love this!!!!I,I found out about this from my mothers group...It was cute and the songs are catchy. It helped my son to start the potty training process.
4,It Worked For Us!,"In other research, this video was strongly recommended. The first time I viewed it, I strongly disliked the video and songs. My son watched, and later asked to see it again. He loved it, and it grew on me, as we used the songs together when he went to the bathroom. After a few weeks, he was trained and dry at night. He was 2 1/2. We gave the video to someone at day care, whose 3 year old girl was still not trained, and within a couple days she was dry. Based on the results, I strongly recommend this, and will use it again with my next kid."
5,A God Send!,"Within one hour of watching this video, my 3-1/4 year old son's potty training went from stalled and strained to successful! The reviewer who said this is perfect for head strong only children is right on the money. The adults may be saccarine sweet and the songs may seem trite to adults, but they are exactly what my little boy needed to turn potty training back into a positive activity after weeks and weeks of difficult struggles. Buy it!"
3,A bit sappy,I rented this form my local Library. I thought the songs were a bit sappy. I think it focuses on boys to much. I am trying to train a girl. I am afraid she may get a mixed message. I will not buy it. It is not worth 20 dollars.
1,Just Terrible,"After 10 minutes of this tape my daughter asked to watch another tape. This video did not keep her attention. I could not believe how terrible it is - it spends only a few minutes on potty training, the rest is about a party. The video was a waste of my money."
4,Great video!,"I'm training my 2 year old daughter and 4 year old son (with a developmental disability). They both love it. They ask to see ""the potty video"" several times a day. It's a great reinforcement of everything else that goes along with potty training- underwear, books on the subject, charts to see their progress. A worthwhile investment. Very good for 3 and 4 year olds especially."
3,I was very disappointed in this video,"I was very disappointed in this video. Although my younger sisters loved the songs and the clown, there really isn't much potty training instruction for the preschool set. With the exception of one child (who did not even use a potty chair), all of the children were 4+ years old. While that may be fine if you are having trouble potty training an older child, it was not helpful to me or my parents. However, this video was very good at expressing hygiene. As I mentioned, the only preschooler was shown in diapers (as instead of wearing underpants- a big no, no for potty training!) and used a standard toilet rather than a potty chair. I ended up renting Once upon a Potty from our local library."
2,Not about potty training- more about boys birthday party!,This video was such a disappointment! It was more focused on the 4-yr old's bday party. YAWN~~I wouldnt recommend it to parents who really want to show their child how to use the potty. The rest of the story line is distracting and boring to the child watching it. My daughter was bored-so I had to keep talking about the potty things during the story of the bday party.
1,OH MY GOD WHY????,"I sat in complete awe when I watched this video. I myself am completely confident in my ability to go to the bathroom. Now that I have watched this video, I feel a bit confused. My friend Mike P. gave it to us and said, ""Learn the songs!"" Well we did, and now we are not the same. Why? Why would anyone do this? Why is that little man sitting on the counter watching young children take a dump? This is sick! Jeesh! DO NOT WATCH THIS! No wait!!! DO WATCH THIS, Do it NOW!"
1,This movie shows what the Stock Market is like!,"SELL SELL SELL! BUY BUY BUY! It's back and forth in this movie. I might as well shove a piece of cheese up my daughter to plug her up!My daughter watched this movie and then found it ""appropriate"" to let the brown stuff go on my new carpet while dressed in a balarina dress and imagining that she was at a Birthday Party.This movie reminds me of my days working at that wreched Stock Market building. Everything just reverses itself.I advise no one to buy this movie because it WILL force your children to let the Brown Bombs (or green or whatever your child eats) on the carpet.Well... back to replacing the carpet..."
2,Well produced and almost good,"If I wasn't listening closely, The Art of Disappointment would be a great summer soundtrack. But to compare them, especially lyrically, to Weezer is kind of an insult. This is a cute indie band full of cute indie boys who do a decent job of writing cute indie songs except they say everything that you should imply and revel in the inane. Like a lot of indie sorta-rock bands out there, their strength is in not standing out, being another pretty good band.And they're certainly that, don't get me wrong. This is a great sounding album, and if you're not so picky about your lyrics, in fact if you're ok with a cut-rate Superdrag(!)..you'll love it."
3,The Benjamins - The Art of Disappointment,"Ten (10) tracks of thoughtful, inspired pop rock. Nothing out of the ordinary but this was a big surprise coming from the early years of Drive-Thru Records (when DTR was arguably weaker than they are currently). The lyrics are intriguing and the song writing is fairly focused. Like most slightly-above-average rock albums it thrives when it is catchy yet smart and sinks when it comes accross as overly cheesy (which The Benjamins occasionally do). Think a less sugary, more intelligent version of geek rock. Check out ""Wonderful,"" and ""Dr. Frank Was Right."" 3/5"
5,Guaranteed to Rock your Brain!,"Hey all punk rock fans.. any of you who have influences to the likes of Weezer, Superdrag, or any of the like.. or if you are just a great punk rock fan - you MUST pick up ""The Art of Disappointment"" by the Benjamins.. They are the hottest new band, and they are ready to take over the whole world! The cd is a great combination of slow paced songs, to fast melodic songs. Together with awesome guitar riffs and amazing vocals ""as well as mind-throbbing lyrics"" this band is absolutely amazing!Make sure you pick up this cd.. and I guarantee you , that you wont be disappointed! Also, check them out on tour!"
5,You MUST Buy This CD!!,"I can't say enough good things about this CD. You know the records you put on and, after a few plays, you really start to get into it? This isn't one of those. I couldn't get enough of this disc after the first time I put it in the stereo. The Benjamins are the best new band I've heard in a long, long time. Get this release now and get in on the ground floor of the next big thing."
2,Flower Skin,"Maybe I read it wrong, but I was expecting a HARD SKIN cover. When I received it, it was just a full STICKER. The flowers are beautiful so I decided to keep it. The delivery was FAST."
3,"help! what does ""Table Error"" mean?","ooops! painters moved our unit and tipped it...cd's got bumped around. We've now removed all the CD's. The changer door is open and we're trying to re-instert the CD""s...but we get t his message ""Table Error""...Anyone out there know what this means? Thanks for your help!"
1,cd player,product was poorly packed and the front pplastic window panel was broken in four piecas still waiting for the return of monies
1,SONY 400-MEGA CHANGER,"I loved this unit the day I bought it. Took me all weekend to type in all the CD titles and used it just about everyday. Until the thing jammed. Apparently, as I selected a CD to play, the machine dropped the CD and then the carousel started spinning, jammed, made a very loud jerking sound and stopped working since. HAD SONY THOUGHT OF MAKING A LITTLE TRAP DOOR IN THE REAR CLOSE TO WHERE THE CD LOADS, I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THE CD OUT IN TIME BEFORE THE CAROUSEL STARTED SPINNING. THE BIGGEST FLAW IN THIS UNIT IS THAT YOU CANNOT REACH IN THE BACK TO TAKE A DROPPED CD OUT. THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO THE BACK AREA (IF A CD IS DROPPED BY THE MACHINE), IS TO TAKE THE SHELL OF THE UNIT OUT. THERE ARE ABOUT 10 SCREWS TO TAKE OUT. TERRIBLE! Just keep your CD's in a couple of CD wallets and you can save yourself the headache!"
2,sony cdp-400 400 - disc mega changer,Will the was all right when I got it but as I played it strated to have trouble playing so now I have to have it worked on you should have someone look at them better before sending out to us Thank you
4,Losing the memory,"Thank you for contacting SONY Online Support.I had read reports that some people lost what they had spent hours typing in, and some had not, when unplugging the unit. I was one who lost everything...probably 10 hours of work. I contacted Sony and you can see their response below. Be careful~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Sony CDP-CX400 CD changer has an internal rechargeable power supply which powers the memory that holds the user entered data or custom file names. If the unit is left unpowered for over a month, the internal power supply runs down resetting the memory. We suggest that you keep the unit powered all the time to preserve manually entered data."
1,The worst of them all,"Do not ever buy one of these. After loading 400 CDs, naming or rather seminaming them since you only have 20 characters in a very akward and difficult way, and playing maybe 10 times, the machine stuck and could not move again. It is a faulty and cheap design which not only does not work right, does not show the complete names of the CDs but also any time you have to look for a CD it moves so the motor should not last. Well, anyway, before it got stuck. It is a shame that Sony should sell something like that."
4,Pretty good,"It's nice Sony has a Mega changer. There aren't many products in this space. I just bought this model and am happy with the perfomance but the work to enter info about the CD is overly complex and time consuming. First get to the selection that let's you add the CD title. Then press several more buttons to get to the place where you can type the artist in a file list. Then press more buttons so you assign the artist in the file list to that particular CD. I'm using a keyboard and this is still taking forever.Also, make sure you buy a CD case to put the CD covers in, then label the covers with a sticky that corresponds to the number in the carousel where that CD sits. If you never browse your CDs or don't care about looking at the song list forget this suggestion."
4,Enjoyable jazz,"I didn't realize when I ordered this CD that it wasn't Dave Brubeck but his son and another musician who had recorded it. After playing it I was happy I ordered it, as the music is great. Sometimes a mistakes turn out to be a good thing!"
3,Nice While It Lasted,"After about 12 months of non-reckless-use the MP3 audio jack went bad, only delivering one channel of sound. Shortly thereafter, the jog rotary dial stopped functioning. At the 18 month point, the touch screen gradually went farther and farther out of calibration to the point which it became unusable. Sadly, I can no longer use the PDA and it is destined for the electronic graveyard."
5,Good Place to Start,"We have several of the ""Everything"" books and, as usual, we were not disappointed in this one. There are plenty of forms to use to help you layout your budget. They think of things we normally would not have. They cover what do you want vs what do you need and explain the difference. They also cover how to figure out what to budget for each person in the household.We've tried different ones in the past but this one puts it into understandable English. Doing a budget is hard enough without spending all our time figuring out what a book is trying to tell us."

1,Resource hog!,"Terrible is all I have to say. When this thing downloads updates, your internet connection comes to a screeching halt! Scans take over an hour. I'll never buy again."
2,Panda Shmanda...I'm not impressed,"I bought this to replace Trendmicro. I prefer Trendmicro. This software might work but it tends to do some annoying things.The Bad1) It does slow down my machine more than trendmicro did, but not as much as McAfee2) I get random popup balloons from windows telling me I'm not protected with a firewall yet the software is clearly on.3) When I got to get updates to any software other than windows I have to reset the software in panda, don't remember needing to do that with others.4) Since installation my wireless connection needs constant reseting.The good1) it was free after the rebates. Given a choice I'll be switching back to Trendmicro."
1,Files deleted,"Panda deleted 3 of the files in my favorites each time it downloaded updates. I contacted panda and did what they instructed, but the program still deleted these files. Panda also slowed my computer to an almost stop each time it was downloading updates. I removed panda and installed Norton, and have had no further problems."
1,STAY AWAY FROM PANDA...,"I bought this 1 week ago at a local Staples.. The box makes it sound like the solution to all your problems.. It also says they offer tech support 24 X 365..Sounds great.... the problem is..it will not install on my computer. I keep getting a message to remove NORTON ANITVIRUS before I can install Panda. I removed NORTON and it no longer can be found thru control panel, remove software or thru a search of my hard drive.PANDA still will not install. I keep getting the same message. UNINSTALL NORTON.So I tried to contact tech support per the box. I found out they offer tech support 24 x 365 via email. I have sent 3 emails in a week and have received no response.Bottom line is I have a product I cannot use.. TECH SUPPORT does not exist. It deserves 0 stars in my book. Spend your money somewhere else."
4,"Good B+ Movie, Good for the family","This movie produced by Turner was originally made for TV. It has a couple of recognized actors and has a good positive message for kids older than 8 - definitely a ""G"" movie with a good moral lesson. Now, for the whole truth, my son and I were extras in the movie when it was filmed here in Atlanta and so, it made sence to get a DVD version since we only had a VHS version. You can buy it for not much more than you can rent it for and show it to your kids or grand kids (it's for parents too!)"
2,Disappointed,"The first 150 pages of this book consist mainly of very detailed descriptions of nobles you'll probably never meet and complicated politics you'll probably never be a part of. What I wanted were maps, monsters, magic items, and adventures. These things come mainly in the last 70 pages, but there is nothing breathtakingly new, and the adventures are pretty run-of-the-mill. Could have been much stronger."
4,Wester Empire Sourcebook Review,I like this book because it gives me more information about the Western Empire plus it helps me with the quests my friends and I make. I think that this would be a great book for any fan of Palladium.
4,This toy works much better than I expected!,"My son has been interested in this toy for well over a year now. After reading the reviews here I was never going to get it and had pretty much talked him out of it, but every once in awhile he would mention it. So when I was shopping for his 7th birthday I saw it on sale at Toys R Us for $40. I was VERY hesitant to purchase it, but I thought that maybe the Jr version would work and that the K'nex pieces themselves were worth the $40.First my husband put together the Jr. version and it worked just fine. So my son took it down and built the big version. He put together the whole thing himself and it works great. Every so often the balls get stuck, but it by far exceeded my expectations. Is it worth $99? Maybe. But it's definately worth the price when it's on sale.Thumbs up to this toy!"
2,We love KNEX--just not this set.,"We bought this KNEX set for our son last Christmas. We bought it even after reading reviews that said that it was too hard to get the tubes in the right position to make it work, thinking ""our son can do it."" He LOVES KNEX and was so excited to get it. The reviews were right--it is very frustrating and we never could get it to work really right. I suggest the other sets, especially the rollercoasters."
1,Don't Buy This Toy!,"I have been an assembler at a certain toy store that shall remain nameless for 5 years. When i was asked to build this toy as a display model, I thought it would be fun and would enjoy it. BUT I DIDN'T! It took me 8 hours and I didn't have enough pieces and it didn't work properly and was destroyed in under an hour. I do not recommend this toy to anyone - any parent - who plans on building this for their child. If you have a child with lots of experiece w/ Knex, they might like it, but overall...its really bad. Don't buy it. It's not good. And i'm not bitter."
1,unbelievable set-up,"The KNEX company has written incredibly poor instructions for putting this game together.There are no words only pictures. My husband has spent 12 hours working on getting this toy ready to be played. When he reached step 138 out of 145 he discovered that there were missing pieces. When I called the company to inform them of this, I discovered that they actually had a seperate line for missing pieces. Once I reached that operator she informed me that my son would receive those missing pieces at the earliest by the end of this week. Not a great way to spend your holiday staring at your uncompleted toy just waiting to be put together. I would recommend this toy to no one."
1,Run away,One of the most frustrating gifts I have ever given one of my children. 6 hours of assembly to have none of the paths work correctly. None of the paths worked consistently. The balls shot out of the top of the unit and onto the floor half the time. The balls would not travel through the ladder assembly. The box was missing parts but we were able to piecemeal things together. Not a precision toy. There is no play value in the game when it doesn't work.
2,Difficult to enjoy this visual splendor!,"Our 7 year old built this himself in 3 afternoons, some of which he had to complete standing on a small stepstool. He did have to take some pieces that were missing out of his other knex sets. It is absolutely amazing when the shoots work, but so flimsy that the sheer force of one ball going through the hoops sets the entire tower into misaligmnent and you have to readjust everything. This is only a toy for the patient child, with a scientific mind, like my son is. My 4 year old was disgusted and called it a stupid toy, his father agrees. Their grandfather who paid $100 is also disgusted. By the way, it takes up six square feet and when someone walks across the hard wood floor the tower misaligns. OH, and whoever designed this should realize that sending only 1 ball with a guy in it causes huge fights to get the ""special"" ball. Obviously a numbskull with no children designed this."
1,Horrible gift,"My children received this toy from their grandfather this Christmas. I spent 1 entire day trying to put it together and found I had made an error somewhere. The next day the kids and I tore the tower down, counted all the pieces and bagged them individually. We had all the pieces listed in the direction booklet. I spent the next day rebuilding the tower and still ran out of pieces. Once the tower was finally built, it wouldn't work as described. We could get one or two parts of it to work but the rest wouldn't. We left the toy alone for the day and planned to tweak it the next day. However, the tower fell over and I took it apart and put the pieces back in the box. Hopefully never to come out of the box again. The boys received the roller coaster last year for Christmas. It also was a pain to put together but at least it worked!"
2,No Way!,"Overall I give the ""Big Air Ball Tower"" 2 stars. Sure your kid might have fun with it for a wile but the first thing to consider is, How dedicated are they going to get? My opinion is if you get this your probably going to be spending $89.99 on a pile of sticks and plastic snowfakes that will be laying on the floor, in the corner of your basement for two years even if your child has it constructed or not."
4,Stinky toy.,"I received this toy on my (...) birthday from my mother.....I really wanted this toy and was so happy to receive it.I've built with many other Knex products and all my friends have this and they said it was fun but it really wasnt. I got so frusterated that I destroyed what I created in 5 minutes! I finished yesterday and guess what!! It broke today. I went to my room to play with it and I turned on the light and didn't even touch it and it totally just collapsed! DON""T BUY THIS TOY!!!Parents: If you do buy this dont let your kids get frusturated uif they need help dont help them just say ""You wanted it, you build it."" or else bring it back to the store because it's definitely not worth it!"
1,childish pranks,"I was looking for some info to payback some of my "" x-best buds"" and there are nothing but silly ideas and nonsense in this book. An incredible waste of money and extremely misleading. Get it at your library!!"
3,Good reading but not so practical,The book I would say is more for laughs than revenge. A lot of these practical jokes are not so practical and even if they were you would probably get jail time if caught.If you are willing to take some risks to get revenge then this book probably is for you. Keep this one in the bathroom and anyone on the potty should get a kick out of it.
3,BIg book of no imagination,"This book does have some interesting ways to get revenge, but I expected much more imagination from this author that has written so many books of this type. I was a little disapointed."
1,Very juvenile book,"I bought this book looking for some sophisticated methods of getting revenge or ""payback"". Something inspired; maybe high tech; maybe not high tech. Instead it suggested things like ""break into your neighbors house; fill his toilets with redi-mix concrete"". Extremely juvenile; the book read like a comic book for ten year olds. After skimming the book, I returned it. Very disappointing!!!"
4,"GREAT, great!!","After the a little bit ""experimental"" NAKED THUNDER, GIllan came came to straight forwar hard rock with 1991's TOOLBOX. THe album has a inf your face sound, it's highly energetic, it has punch,a tight band, with guitarrist Steve Morris, bassist Leonard Haze.Very good hard rocking album."
3,Don't buy this version...,I compared this to the previous CD release (Eagle Rock) and this remaster sounds too bright (or harsh sounding) for my taste.1 star for mastering - 5 stars for the music.
1,video did not play,I was very disappointed to find that this video was defective. It ended up in the trash. Bummer that I wasted 17 dollars.
2,Poor technical guidance-Dimage 7,"At first I loved it-The power was incredible-The Dimage 7 is a power hungry pig and 1600mah recharbles Nimh never cut it. So I bought this charger and at first I never ran out of power, now it won't hold a charge. Mizco (digipower) is a very hard company to find-but after a year the information is geting better. This was sold as a 6v compatible when the dimage 7 is actually needing 7.2v-The MAHA Powerbank turned out to be a better choice for me."
1,Buyer Beware! Promised adapters are NOT available.,"The Please Hold! pkg. specificially states: ""We have made even more adapters available on our website at [...]"" The two please hold phones which we ordered fit neither of our Nokia cell phones. Okay, I'm willing to pay extra, as I'll obviously have to do, but, oh gee, every possible search term for phone adapters, additional adapters, please hold! adapters, etc., just brings up the Please Hold handset.Too bad. It's a great idea. False promises make for poor marketing, tho."
2,what? what?,"it's an awesome idea! no brain tumors! cool retro phone! can hold it on your neck! BUT you can't hear. it works off and on (although i have to admit i'm having trouble with all of my electronics)i've talked to other people with this phone and we all have the same problem, the person on the other end can hear you fine but sometimes you can't hear them.could be good for some conversations but i'm dissapointed."
4,Pretty good movie with complex content,"First i wondered if this one could be a good movie. But then i lean back and enjoyed every second of it. Exciting moments go hand in hand with intellectual dialogs. The actors r very talented and now i wonder why there doesnt exists a better promotion for this movie. But at least i dont give it the full five stars, because there was a lack of presence of Moby Dick. The rest was perfectly entertaining. Ok lets give it four n a half. :-)"
3,A Parent of a Deaf Child,"I am the hearing parent of a Deaf child and I have very mixed feelings about this book.On the one hand, I find it very informative and it explains Deaf culture and the history of Deaf education very passionately and accurately. On the other hand, the information about cochlear implants and their efficacy is obscenely out dated and one sided.As a parent who has chosen ASL as the primary language of their child AND a cochlear implant, I wish there was a better treatment of the subject."
3,deaf,required reading for one of my classes I took at Phoenix College. Never did finish it though which is sad
4,Required reading,"For a hearing person to genuinely understand the American Deaf perspective of the world, Harlan Lane is the perceptual link. He wields the English language precisely, writing primarily to a hearing audience in an attempt to bring their thinking around to fully understanding and possibly even embracing the Deaf cultural view of themselves as a linguistic minority. My one complaint is that after a point it seems redundant, or at the least tedious, unless you already have an all-consuming passion for the subject matter. In any regard, this is an essential text if you intend to pursue a career in interpreting or any Deaf-related field, if you have Deaf children or parents, if you are Deaf or hard of hearing yourself, or if you have any reason whatsoever to care about the Deaf."
4,A decent toy for 6 months and up,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old and learning to sit on her own. I figured it might encourage her for sit up play, but she would tip it over and use it in the tummy position till she was really good at sitting at her own. The little animals that come with it don't interest her as much as the base does. It keeps her busy for a good while however -- the colors, music, and lights attract her. She is now 8 months old, and still plays with it."
4,almost complete series,"The Amazon description is a bit mashed together, but it says this set contains these 6 dvds;Care Bears to the Rescue MovieCheer, There & EverywhereHelping HeartsFlower PowerTell-Tale TummiesBear BuddiesThis newer version of Care Bears comes in 2 seasons & 4 cgi movies.Each season is 26 episodes over 13 half hours, the final 4 episodes are recut versions of 2 direct-to-dvd episodes.This leaves 48 episodes which were spread across 6 2-hour dvds with 8 episodes each.I was hoping this set would be the core 6 episode dvds, but they threw one of the movies in instead.The episode disc that is missing isCare Bears: Share-a-Lot in Care-a-Lot.The 1st cgi movie & the direct-to-dvd episodes are in another multipackCare Bears: Flurries of Fun,& the other 2 cgi movies areCare Bears: Share Bear Shines Movie&Care Bears: Giving Festival Movie."
2,Not For Little Children,"I bought this for my 3 year old grand daughter, but after watching it, decided not to let he see it.The language and antics are really not for children that young, especially the name-calling of the character that has a facial problem."
4,Good video,The first one is the only one that's actually related to halloween but the other stories are have scarry themes. Its great for the Halloween season and my kids love it.
3,These Episodes Do NOT Contain the Original Opening Sequence!!,"Attention nostalgia fans-If you buy these old cartoons partly for nostalgia, like I do, then you know that being able to see the original opening sequence of the show is all important. It's what you remember most about the show. However, while these are episodes from the 1980s ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" cartoon show, these episodes do NOT contain the original opening sequence that started the show. The theme song is there, but it's not the same animated opening sequence. They instead substituted it for some other sequence that I didn't recognize. So, if you want to see the original opening of this cartoon show, you may want to wait for another DVD or DVD set to come out."
4,Gorier than most.,"This is a great video for educational purpose. However, I find it a little disturbing that throughout the show there seems to be little concern for how frequently humans intervene in the wild world. While these animals are kept in a conservation, the humans in this show seem to use darts on animals several times an episode. Sometimes it makes you wonder how much of the show is actually scripted.It is also quite gory. You need to have a strong stomach to watch this collection."
1,Disappointing,"I've been shopping on Amazon for years and have often seen negative reviews to which I paid little attention. This time, I should've listened.The reviews about sizing problems are correct - I got this item after ordering 2 sizes larger than I usually get, and it was completely off. The waist was too small and the torso section wasn't anywhere near long enough. Maybe for smaller men or females this wouldn't be the case, but for me I've never been so disappointed in a purchase, and this will be the first product I've ever returned.If this were $20 or less I'd say take the chance, but at $50 find something else.The one upside is that it arrived quickly and, for once, in appropriately sized packaging."
4,Just about ghostbusters perfect,"I ordered this for my ghostbusters costume for halloween, and it fits the bill perfectly. I originally ordered the medium, and I'm female and 5 ft 7 and it was huge! So I gave that one to my dad and ordered a small, which fixed all the problems I'd had with the medium. I had to sew on it a bit to make it fit better, because coveralls look good on no one, and it was comfortable and fit very well."
1,sizing?,"The jumpsuit showed up quickly.Awesome.I tried it on, and really? I ordered it a size big figuring I would rather it be baggy.My balls wish I had ordered it two or three sizes bigger. The legs could also be a good six inches shorter. I had planned on using it for part of a halloween costume then as a coverall for paintball. There is NO WAY I could run around or crouch in it.If you are going to have freakishly sized clothes, please have your own sizing chart, thats actually true to your clothes."
3,Decent for the price,"I thought I'd have been a little more impressed with this product. Don't get me wrong...it's quite good. Definitely all the design features for an airforce flight suit. However, the material seems a bit inferior to me....again, you get your money's value I guess. It fits well...should have taken a large in it though (I ordered medium). But no big deal. Seems quite cool (temperature wise) for working. Definitely will be using it. Please note....this product is not NOMEX or anything."
3,fair product but not for us,"We purchased it to have a white noise for our baby and if not working (it was the case, too bad for us) we wanted to listen some CD. We cant' find yet how to listen to the CD without having the alarm on...Too bad...But nice looking and cheap price"
3,fast service,i ordered this radio cd alarm clock radio havent tried it yet it is a gift for my daughter but it arrived in excellant shape and with fast delivery
1,No Weather Band,"This clock radio is hard to read the time and when you want to listen to a cd to go to sleep to it lights up like a juke box. It takes three steps to get it to turn off after the cd is played. I would return it but by the time you pay the return shipping and restocking, its not worth it."
2,I was disappointed with this.,"I was more interested in a good alarm clock than the radio (so I don't even know if it picks up stations in my bedroom, I haven't tried). I thought that having a radio and CD player may be handy on occassion, so went wit this instead of a plain alarm clock.But the VERY bright blue light is just too much, and the alarm clock is a major pain to set. I bought this some time ago (and there was not the long list of bad reviews on it when I bought it). Had I seen these, I would have avoided purchasing this clock radio.I'm now using my cell phone as an alarm clock and this is taking up space in my bedroom, unused."
3,many function in a good value,"this one is multi functional and in a very good price, the only problem is too heavy. it's bigger than i thought it will be. it looks very good and got everything i need."
3,"Not Bad, but just too bright","The CD players works well and the sound is good for a $30 radio. I liked the dual alarms, they were a bit tricky to set up, but not impossible with practice, lacks a 7-5-2 feature witch I really want.My Biggest complaint is that it is just ...WAY WAY TOO BRIGHT... even at the lowest setting, and weirdly enough this makes it very hard to read the Time in the dark. The back-light is just blinding in the dark, so I had to be within a foot or so from the clock to read it. I just could not sleep with this thing on a night"
2,Needs a better Display,"I like the features, and look of this alarm clock. The one BIG thing i do not like about it is the Display. You cannot see it unless it is right in front of you. I tried to put it on a shelf 1' above my bed, and the display was no longer visible at that angle. The backlight is also pretty bright, but not a problem if you like a nightlite in your room."
1,Go buy a one at Walmart,"I thought I was getting a good deal and avoiding going into a store to get what I wanted...but in this case the whole reason that I made this specific purchase (good price for a CD alarm clock) BUT when it arrived (it was like Christmas, I was so excited) the CD player didn't work. I sent it back and got my $ back, and went to Walmart this weekend. It's possible the CD component broke during shipment, but still disappointing nonetheless."
4,Love this little radio,"I love this little radio, it's so cool my little son loves it and the sound is good considering the price. Keep in mind you are not going to get a stereo sound but its great for small spaces."
4,Bright lights and big cities,"This item is easy to set (time and both alarms) and has fairly good quality sound although the reception is poorer than my previous radio. The main complaint I have about this product is that -- having an alarm as one of the features -- it would seem to me that most people would keep this by their bedside, like me. The problem is that the light eminating from the clock is a bright blue and illuminates the bedroom. I have to physically cover the part of the radio where the light resonates from at night or face away from the radio."
1,Beware,"First, the instructions for this clock radio/CD player are terrible! I know two highly educated people who bought this--neither could figure out how to wake up to CD. Also, the digital display is way too bright and the numbers are unreadable. This is the worst designed product I have ever experienced--the designers need to go back to the drawing board. I gave this to my husband as a gift. He didn't want to hurt my feelings, but finally had to speak up and admit he doesn't want it by his bedside!"
2,Too Bright,"This clock looks cool, but thats about it. The LCD screen is too bright at night. Even though there are two settings for it, the low setting is still too bright. The clock is also bigger than it looks online, but it is not too big."
2,Confusing Clock CD/Radio,I was really excited to get this alarm clock but I've had it awhile and I still don't know how to turn the damn alarm on. I've set the alarm but I haven't figured out how to turn it on. Very frustrating!
1,Piece of Junk,"DO NOT BUY!! Blue light is too bright and lights up my bedroom. CD player works terribly and has skipping problems with original cd's and burnt cd's. Sound quality is D at best. Ability to set 2 alarms it a good feature, however don't buy for only that feature. Radio stations will not come in."
3,Definately worth it for the price you pay,"I wasn't looking for anything fancy. Just something to wake me up. The radio reception sucks! But the CD player works fine. I mean look at the price, you get what you pay for. And I just want to wake up on time...so if you are looking for anything more than that then keep shopping this isn't it."
2,Cannot see time,"What is a clock without being able to see the time??? You have to be within 3 feet of this clock to see the time. I guess if it's right by your bedside and you only look to it for the time when you are getting up it would be okay, but I bought mine for the baby's room and needed to see it from across the room in the middle of the night. Other than that, it functioned properly. The sound is not great, but wasn't expecting much for the price I paid."
3,Not bad for the price,"Really, for around $10, this is not a bad deal. Believe it or not, the biggest problem I had with this clock was the fact that it was waaaay too bright for a bedroom clock. I actually had to make a little bag to put over it at night to shut out the light. The CD player works fine, no problems, no complaints with that so far. I think the only other thing I found annoying about this clock is setting the alarm/time. The manual isn't too clear on how to do this, and it takes a couple times to figure out how to set the alarm. Other than the brightness and the difficulty of setting the alarm, it's worth the $10, and it is nice looking."
1,TERRIBLE PURCHASE,"This unit certainly ranks among the worst alarm clocks I've ever purchased. It was purchased for my daughter as a Xmas gift. It is now seven months later and the unit is totally dead. Of course, it is out of warranty now. Even prior to this event, this was a poor purchase. The adjustments and controls are so poorly layed out and non-intuitive that I couldn't always figure out how to set the alarms or the correct time without the users guide nearby. Even something as simple minded as figuring out which button controlled the radio or cdrom became a chore. In short, poor design, poor engineering, poor quality. Stay away!"
1,3 Months Old,The clock light lights up the room... forget trying to have the cd player on at night... and after 3 months of use i guess you wont be able to anyway!The cd player stopped working
1,Don't buy this radio,This is a piece of junk. The radio reception is terrible. FM is marginal and AM is almost nonexistent.
2,cute clock; doesn't work great,"I love the design and looks of this clock and it's upright CD design. However, I think that because of the vertical playing position, it tends to skip more than a horizontal player, even with brand new CDs. Also, the blue backlight is EXTREMELY bright. I have to cover it at night, which pretty much defeats the purposse of a backlit clock."
2,"Well, it works...sometimes","If you are considering purchasing this item, keep looking. This clock / radio/ CD player is way too sensitive to enjoy. I have it on my sink in the bathroom and if anything even touches (just barely) the unit, the CD will skip and/or discontinue to play. The reception on the radio is minimal. It picks up only very strong stations and is fuzzy on most other stations. It's worth spending a little more to get a much better product. Don't be mislead by the ""cute"" look of the product."
1,Great while it worked...,I purchased this alarm clock for my daughter's room. I wanted something that was light in color that displayed the time and played cd's - nothing fancy. I loved the look of this alarm clock and everything worked great for the first six months. Then the radio stopped working (not a big deal as I had primarily bought it for the cd player). A month later we noticed that it wasn't keeping time correctly (it runs fast). It's now been ten months and today the cd player stopped working.
2,Nice appreance/price but not very pleased,"I purchased this product and returned it. A couple of the buttons were stuck down and there wasn't any place to plug headphones in. The overall appreance was very nice and it was easy to use. I bought this to use at work, but without the option of headphone use the product instatnly became useless."
2,Not so good,I wanted this clock for my son so he could wake up and go to sleep listening to his CDs. First the clock doesn't keep time too well. It some how ends up being 30min fast. Then you cannot go to sleep listening to the CD if he wants to wake up to it. It is very confusing to figure out and I have always needed the directions on hand to figure out how to program it. The light is very bright too.
1,uninspired and WAY over priced,"This book's ""blessing"" is just a standard little diddy that's too long for a hallmark card. The pictures are a collection of 'antiques,' and while some of them are quite nice, together they lack any unity and instead form a jumble of illustrations. I could see paying $5.99 or even $7.99 for such a book... even then a bit pricey, but since it's a 'good fit' for a house warming gift... No way is it worth $15!"
2,"Good Backswing, but no Follow Through","The author starts well but doesn't finish as he jumps from the course, to the town to the townspeople, but with no real insights into the main subject: the golf course and the tournament itself. His one-sided portrayal of Cliff Roberts doesn't help the reader truly understand why Roberts spent much of his life devoted to Augusta National. The last chapter was out of joint with the rest of the text as he struggles to end what he started. Hard to recommend to others."
4,"Good book, great author, golf enthusiasts will enjoy","I have been to the tournament and knew a little of the history behind it. Sampsons book was very interesting and will be of interest to anyone following the game. He must have done a lot of research to find some of the people today, years after their Masters experience. I am going to attend the tournament again with a different outlook."
4,"""Masterful!""","This book was recommended by an acquaintance, a fellow lover of golf. Interesting history of Augusta! Well written...a good read."
4,Inside the Masters,"Having just attended the 2012 Masters, this book gave excellent insight into the mystique of Augusta National, the Masters, and the aura surrounding this great American event. Highly recommend."
3,Good Read,"Not a bad read. Would have liked more insightfulness. Just felt is glossed over some things, while it focussed on non golf related, Augusta matters too much. Value for money worthwhile as it wasn't too pricy. Best summed up by, once read went back on shelf."
3,A look at the other side,"For years I have read nothing but positive things about Augusta National and The Masters. Like the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Augusta rules with an iron fist. While the author often jumps to some conclusions that may be out of line - it is important to read discriminately - the book is nevertheless a valuable look at the underbelly of The Masters, and it is a refreshing break from the toe-the-line approach that Clifford Roberts et al have made journalists take since the beginning."
1,A Big Disappointment,"Mr. Sampson's book on Ben Hogan was well done. I expected more from this book. This book has a number of factual inaccuracies (looks like it was rushed to press without careful fact checking; not surprising given the large number of recent books regarding the Masters). If you read this book, be sure to read David Owens' book for a different view. To me, the book was disappointing because Mr. Sampson's other work is very good."
3,"Liked it, but not as much insight as the title suggests.","It was an easy read but the author rambles from topic to topic. Plus, the research, as one might expect, was skimpy as far how the Augusta National CC operates. I would still recommend this book."
4,If you want to know what's behind the azaleas,We all know that a conservative corporate culture tightly controls the Masters. This book delves into the origins of the Masters and the Augusta National. It's best in explaining the development of the Masters mystique in the Eisenhower era. No real surpises but an illuminating examination of the vision of the Augusta club and the Masters tournament. It doesn't hide the many warts of Augusta but remains sympathetic to a vision achieved. Highly readable.
1,Vindictive for no reason,"True, every event just like every person has to some degree a ""dark side"" this book however fails to truly reveal any concrete evidence and instead relies on the weakest of circumstantial evidence in an attempt to paint the golf tournament as a mirror to the past of the South. Rather than being a scholarly and well balanced approach, this reads more like something out of the National Enquirer. Sampson just goes out of his way to try to make anything associated with Augusta seem in some way wrong or evil. Really an atrociously terrible book, even the writing style couldn't salvage this one. I regret having the misfortune to have purchased and read this one."
2,FORE !!!,"Wait for April and watch it on TV. They history of the club was fine, for the first 50 pages. But it went on for 50 more. the discirption of every guy whoever rode the train from N.Y. was little much. I wanted to see more on the club in teh modern era. No secerts have been revieled. Save your twenty bucks. Joe"
1,Strathwood Bainbridge Round Table - 42 inch,Very disappointed in the quality of the table..First one arrived with a big hole broken in top of table..The 2nd one they sent had two legs that could not be attached because they were made at a 90 degree angle at upper base of each leg..so unable to put the screw thru to attach to table top. The 3rd table is ok and was able to put together. Maybe I just had bad luck with my orders...The table is a nice heavy one so sure it will not move with strong winds..I had ordered the other matching pieces or I probably would have given up after receiving the defective one.
3,Customer Service!,"The table arrived damaged, but Amazon replaced immediately at no cost.The second table arrrived in excellent condition."
1,very bad product,"i bought this product from pj tool & supply to clean and polish watchbands and small pieces of jewelery,i am not sure if the seller swapped the product for a cheaper quality bars because i received them all broken in a bag no paper no name no card no nothing but i can only review what i know, these bars are only paraffin, no abrasive to get the job done, you have to depend on the speed and heat of the buffer wheel to get some results, i have been using abrasives for a few years and i know what i am saying, if you are depending on this product even for small home jobs think again, better get some at sears its a little more money but you will use a fraction of the time and polish, hope this helps anyone who has not bought yet,"
2,Product Shipping Protection Inadequate - Product Contaminated,"This product arrived in a single bubble-wrap envelope, NOT in the carded blister pack as displayed on the product page!Unfortunately, all six grits of the polishing compound were shipped side-by-side in the envelope with no individual covering of any kind.This means the different grits have contaminated each other, and any attempts to use them as is for high-quality buffing and polishing would result in work marred by scratches.Each bar of compound must now be carefully scraped on all surfaces and the removed material disposed of. Time and money wasted!I recommend selecting a different supplier who will appropriately package the product kit for shipping."
1,dried up,Clay was repackaged and dried out. It was completely unusable. Sent in a request for return with no response. I will not buy anything from them again.
2,No box. Not very good compound either.,The only other place I've purchased polishing compound was Sears. Those bars came it a partitioned box which I used for years.These come in a piece of plastic (one bar broken already) which can't really be used to store the bars. The compound itself doesn't look very high quality either -- not like the picture at all. It appears to be mostly parafine with only a little abrasive added. I'm going back to the Sears brand.
5,"classy, useful gift!","I, the buyer, as well as the receiver were very happy with this gift. Looked at many jewelry rolls online and this price, even with the shipping, was a good value for the quality. Liked it so much will definitely buy from this manufacturer in the future. Also came packed well and fast delivery."
2,jewelry box,"quite nice but I made a mistake, thought it was free shipping, and the total cost was not good value at all"
5,Take control of your health with Let's Play Doctor,"The American medical system will milk you for every dime you have if you do not take control of your own health. Let's Play Doctor will give you your life and health back. It did mine. Because of it, I am off all my meds and no longer suffer from arthritis, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I also suggest Dead Doctors' Don't Lie, Rare Earths-Forbidden Cures and Dr. Wallach's new book Immortality."
1,A Load of...,"Unfortunately, Dr. Wallach and this load are a load of something else. Coming from a 25-year sufferer of Cystic Fibrosis, his outrageous claims that CF is not a genetic disease and can be ""prevented and cured"" by proper nutrition have made several in the CF community extremely angry. To think that a veterinarian would try to dispute years of research on a genetic HUMAN disease is absurd. Dr. Wallach has been discredited time and time again and is an embarrassment to the medical community."
5,Enjoyable if outdated,"This book reads not unlike Chuck Klosterman's offerings....being a sort of diary-journalistic approach to a topic. There are a fair amount of spelling errors which surprised me (and I can read both American and British spellings without having the UK spellings tick off my internal spell check) but aside from that the book is great. However, be warned that it is quite outdated and record shops and bars mentioned in it are no longer around, or go under different names now."
4,A fun and interesting reading,I am big fan of Sigurros and Björk and it was intersting to read about the roots of their music in Iceland. It was a easy and enjoyable reading
4,Lords of Dogtown,"Honestly, I'm not really into skateboarding, just got this because Heath Ledger was in it. Turned out to be a really great movie. Mainly about friendship and how teenagers go through ups & downs in life, plus skateboarding, surfing and skate competitions."
4,Dogtown Lite,"Keeping in mind that this telling of the Z-Boys tale is BASED on a true story, it wasn't bad. Being spoiled by watching ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" about 10 times, had problems with some of it. For example, why was Jeff Ho a character in this movie? But since it wasn't intended to be a biographical story, guess that was Peralta's (an original Z-Boy and wrote the screenplay for this movie) call. Have to agree with one reviewer. The moves the boys in this movie are ""half baked"" compared to what they real boys were doing. That aside, I like this version as a ""Hollywood"" telling of the Z-Boys story. Heath did a great job capturing Skip's voice, but was Skip really ""out of it"" most of time. I would highly recommend you watch ""Dogtown and Z-Boys""."
4,Absorb the atmosphere of Venice Beach in the 1970's,"This is a Hollywood-style retelling of the true story of the lives of the Z-Boys, but one that actually succeeds due to an excellent independent director (Catherine Hardwicke of Thirteen fame), a screenplay by original Z-boy Stacy Peralta, Z-boy Tony Alva teaching the actors the moves and the aura of the decade, and a cast of talented unknown young actors. The story is about friendship, boyhood bonds, the stresses of making it big, and the consequences of fame and life in the fast lane. The skating shots, especially those in big, empty swimming pools, were absolutely exhilarating. This is highly recommended for anyone who wants a nostalgic moment or to those who like a good drama."
5,Funky film-making,"I don't give a whit about skateboarding. It's got to be the most annoying activity known to man. But this movie is a real thrill-ride, not because of the content, but because of the quality poured into the technical aspects. Shot in a violently saturated color motif, it's full of 70s surfer dudes who look quite contemporary as they depict the morphing of surfing into skateboarding in a true tale written by one of the dudes portrayed in the film. Great 70s soundtrack, to boot. I'd never heard of any of these people, but evidently they are legends in the field. They all appear in the extras, and some are extras in the film. Very entertaining from a film standpoint, if not content. The late Heath Ledger plays a stoner surf shop owner who invents the notion of a skateboard team back in Venice, Ca., when it wasn't full of tourists."
3,Could Have Been Great,"As a kid growing up in the 70s, Tony Alva was my favorite skateboarder and truth be told he still is so I had to watch this movie. It's a good story, and I enjoyed it.I was disappointed because the stunts portrayed in this film are not indicative of the type of stuff these guys were doing. Alva did some awesome stuff back then, but the movie only shows stuff the average kid does on a playground. And they had the stunt doubles capable of doing an aereal three feet above the lip. A few shots like that with a California blue sky in the background would have made this movie a timeless classic (the way Endless Summer and Blue Crush are for surfing). Instead it's just a pretty good movie."
4,Great historical account!,"This movie is very good, and I believe a very good account of the lifestyle in Dogtown. It does not present a very glamorous lifestyle and is down-and-dirty.Some of the skateboarders have been remarkably successful, and others met their downfall. It is fairly typical of skaters/surfers, and a good movie for aspiring athletes to look at."
5,Awsome but expensive here,This is a great movie for people who like skateboarding or surfing. This movie can be for anyone actually. This movie is much cheaper at retail stores but definately worth it. BUY IT TODAY!!!
4,Great movie,Great for any young surfer...or even any old schooler that grew up in this era...nothing cheese good surfing and skating
5,Awesome,"Love skateboarding, but also love the story line of friendship and over coming dofficulties and and prevailing to something great, rising above"
5,Great Gift,"This was a gift for my grandson, he loves it. Watches it over and over. A great gift for a young man."
5,"Great movie, Great music","I thought this movie was really cool. I still like the original better but this movie was still good. I loved the music in it. Such as the the Hendrix tracks Voodoo Chile and Fire, Sabbath's Ironman, and other good ones. I didnt ike how they put a remake of Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here in it he credits. The movie was still great and is worth the money."
2,Okay movie,"This movie was for my son who is 9 and begged for it. He lost interest in about 30 minutes into the movie. I was able to watch some of it and quite frankly....it was very boring!!! It almost had a documentary setting rather than a movie which made it hard to follow. Anyway, I'm sure it has potential to be a good movie for a certain age group. Just not the young or middle aged group."
3,My Top 5 (Sometimes Unintentionally) Hilarious Moments in this Movie,"Some spoilers contained here.Honorable Mention: Every time the stoned-out-of-her-gourd mom says anything.5. Poor Peggy. She just seemed to be thrown into several scenes just for the sake of posterity-yes, there was an Asian girl on Team Zephyr, but we never actually give her anything to do.4. Tiki, Tiki, Tiki.3. The skateboarding dog-great sardonic humor on Peralta's part2. The Slinky pitch1. I turned to my cousin at the ending, with the cancer patient and the friends miraculously reunited as bros for one last skate together in the pool. I said ""Are you buying this?"" I added later ""If Sid gently passes away while watching them, I'm going to puke."" My cousin said, ""I'm waiting for them to take his wheelchair down into the pool."" Sure enough. And when they did, I had my biggest laugh of the movie.Overall, a unique flick. What a different lifestyle. Some very good action and some sweet camera work."
1,EXCITED! (had to rate it just commenting),I HOPE THIS MOVIE TURNS OUT TO BE BETTER THAN GRIND! YEYA!
4,I guess you had to be there,"Growing up in California in the 70s, I read Surfer and Skateboarder magazine, surfed a little, skateboarded a little, and skiied a lot. I dated guys just like Jay and Skip, and was friends was guys just like Stacy and Tony. As a girl, I was always trying to keep up with the guys, whether skiing, skating, or whatever. I loved this film because it brought back a ton of memories of high school for me (not necessarily of school itself, but of the extracurricular activities). Looking at the reviews, it seems like the West Coast reviewers get his film, and the non-West Coasters don't, which is understandable cuz I guess you had to be there."
2,Nice Try,"I really like the story. I was a skater so it is interesting to see from a historical standpoint. The script may have not been that bad. The problem is the characters seem like they are overacting. The director didn't make it feel real to me. If you are under 20, you may like it alot more than if you are a little older. Even though, they are obviously really trying hard to capture the spirit of these kids, the film comes off too contrived. Maybe, worth seeing though. 2 1/2 stars."
4,Not what you would expect,"I can honestly say that this book was not what I thought it would be. From the cover (flower photo) I thought it would be a women's empowerment sort of thing. It's actually a great read, and wide-ranging. She's got lots of sharp insights. Yeah, there's a touch of new-ageim, but it's not over the top. Plus it even made me laugh a couple of times. It's a really positive collection of essays that can apply to anybody."
5,A great reminder of the great things about Life,"Sometimes it is so easy to forget what blessings we all have. This book is a great reminder. Susan Jeffers always seems to find the right approach to every topic. This is an easy-going, enjoyable read, and you may just learn something."
3,Get Triops instead.,"Sea monkeys can be fun, easy to care for, and educational. However, there are lesser known pets that are arguably more fun, much more educational, and just as easy to care for. Triopses grow much larger in size, are more interesting looking (they have three eyes!) and have more educational value. They've been on earth for so many millions of years, sometimes they are described as living fossils.Plus, they're better for impatient kids. When they're still growing they double in size every day.In short, this summarizes the coolness factor: Sea monkeys are just brine shrimp. Triopses will eat brine shrimp.I gave this toy three stars because it's still basically a good product.Triops Triassic Triops Deluxe Complete Living Creature Kit"
1,A real Dud,I ordered it and it got here quickly. I took it to school and told the students all about the wonderful things they would see. I followed the directions to the letter and guess what??? Nothing happened... no sea monkeys at all. Everyday the kids would dash in to see if we had sea monkeys...but alas there were none.It was extremely disappointing!
3,Sea Monkeys ok,"I bought two basic sea monkey instant life packs. The one small glass bowl I used, I added aquarium rocks & a frog trinket. I don't think this worked well, because after they hatched they didn't live long. The other small glass bowl I used, I just added bottled water. They hatched and are doing fine. They are a few centimeters, and swim all around. The water gets kinda murky from sitting, but I don't want to remove any of it for fear of sucking out a sea monkey, so I will add some bottled water. I missplaced the food and hope they like fishfood. Overall its an ok aquatic ""toy"". I think the most exciting thing about it waiting for them to hatch. I have had them for about 2 weeks, and will write back if anything exciting happens with them."
1,Animals never hatched,"I got dud packages. But if they had hatched, they would've been loads of fun since I've had them before."
2,Monkey Around w/ Magnifying Glass,"The eggs hatched in about 24 hours but these little guys don't seem to be active at all. We check the temperature of water and everything seems to be in order. Because of their tiny tiny size initially, you have to press hard (literally to the glass) to see some movements. So far so good!After ONE week:They all died.....not worth it at all."
3,"Kids enjoyed it, but shrimp died quickly","The grandkids loved it, but the brine shrimp always die quickly. We follow the instructions exactly, and yet they still die. I gave it three since the kids enjoyed it, but I think if you want pets, buy an aquarium."
1,"Only one hatched, he/she is doing fine, but just one?","It's been two months now and I only have one sea monkey. I followed the instructions to the letter, and I originally had two sea monkeys. I think one cannibalized the other, and now I have one. This product is really underwhelming. Is it just me, or did this product work better a few years ago? I've done it in the past, and the results where a lot better. I think the producer/manufacturer is letting the eggs get a little old, to save on cost perhaps."
5,Yoruba History,"I remember reading this book when I was in secondary school over 25 years ago and I can still recall how amazed I was to discover that we Yorubas had organized govermental inititutions. I found out why we as a people are so defragmented, the origin of the Yoruba people and different tribes, the power and might of various tribal empires. I don't think there is another book that has this amount of detail regarding the Yoruba people. Now I need a copy for my library and is now difficult to get hold of."
5,Great Book,"There are considerably information about Yoruba's History and Religion.If you are a priest or worshipper of Orixa , you need to buy this book."
1,The History of the Yorubas by Samuel Johnson,The only value in this book is the historical account given by the missionary who wrote it in the hope of inspiring change. The actions and history of ancient Nigerians is savage and depressing.
5,Great Battery!,"This battery performs flawlessly. I get four hours per charge taking outside daytime shots; two and a half to three hours using the flash. The charge time left indicator is fairly accurate. The battery is a little expensive, but it is worth it in my opinion."
2,Save your money.,"Everything you read in previous reviews is right on point, during DVD playback screen flickers white, most annoying thing ever.There are no options to adjust any sound settings once DVD is in Dolby digital.If you are use to full size home theater receiver this one is poor in options,I tried update the flash software, that was a pain, plus Samsung didn't have any new update on their website, which is terrible to navigate I would like to add.Save your money, I'm just too lazy to return this wanna be full size entertainment system."
1,STAY AWAY!,both me and my parents bought this model and i returned mine 2 times and my parents once cause there made like garbage and keep breaking down! The warrenty also can take over 2 months to get it back!
2,Average sound system,Unit does not have the individual frequency range control that I need. Also the programing is quite complex. Seems to me the sound is very hollow. Very pricey for what it is. All functions do operate ae described in the owners manual. Guess I needed to do more shopping.May be alright for an entry level Home theater system.
2,Not easy to use,The system was not easy to connect to my sharp hdtv. what i mean is that i still cannot use it in conjunction with broadcast t.v. very annoying i have read the instructions and it hasn't helped. With the trouble i had receiving the unit i will probobly never use Amazon again. ie: missing parts and lack of communication between amazon and the shipper.
4,Solid out-of-the-box system,"I've owned this for over a year and I don't have very many negative things to say about it. Pretty easy to setup, if you have any technical ability. The sub cranks out some bass. When I want to try and wake the neighbors I turn it up to about 22 which is pretty loud. It goes up to 40 or 50. ""Transformers"" sounded like something was going to come through the wall when I played it.My only two gripes are the lack of choices for settings. The system offers a few pre set sound options but you can't customize any of them. The next is the HDMI inputs. There is only one so it came down to my cable box or my Xbox. The obvious choice would be the cable box as I watch it more than I play Xbox but I couldn't get it to pick up the signal, so the Xbox won by default. It sounds really good as well.All in all a pretty decent system if you want surround sound right out of the box and don't want to spend an arm and a leg on individual components."
2,Fire hazard,"My wife purchased this system for me last Christmas to go with my new Samsung plasma. After operating the system for approximately 3 months, one night it began sparking and smoking and almost caught fire. I sent the dvd unit to Samsung who, in turn, sent it to some third party for repair. Rather than replacing the unit, the repair company replaced some parts and sent the original unit back to me. The unit still reaks of burnt plastic smell. This may be an isolated incident, but beware and do not leave the unit turned on while away for your home. I have been satisfied with its operation otherwise."
4,The system goes Boom!,"The audio on this is ridiculous, it totally shakes my house, however...every once and a while, the picture goes blank on me, I don't know if my player is dirty or what, but it ticks me off, and worries me, because I bought it off of Amazon, but worse comes to worse it still makes a awesome receiver to use for my sound (hooked the blue ray through it already!) This plus blue ray is incredible!"
5,Great product,"Very easy to use , if you want rear wireless speakers make sure to buy the other unit. I have xm on it also and it will need the xm extras but it is worth it."
3,Great system...but problems with the DVD player on 1080i,"I bought this system about a month ago. It looks very nice and the speakers certainly look and sound great. The ipod option is phenomenal and the 5.1 digital optical audio works superb. However, I noticed some flashing behavior when playing the DVD on 1080i resolution. The problem seemed to worsen once the subtitles was turned on. The same problem occurs (to a lesser degree) on 720p and 480p. I have read about these problems on a similar samsung HT-TX70 player. I have checked the HDMI input on the TV by plugging something else on that port. have tried different HDMI ports. The problems persists....it's definitely the DVD player. I have returned the system and will get a replacement. Hopefully I will not have the same problem.Overall...I love the system. It just doesn't sit well to see these whites flashes take half the screen sometimes when watching a nice movie."
2,Doesn't sufficiently repay the viewer's investment,"Very well made with subtle performances but, as good as it is at what it does, it doesn't sufficiently repay the viewer's investment in watching the movie."
1,One of the Worse,"I fell asleep about half-way thru, which is rare, so the movie must have really stunk. Lots of train tracks. Not much dialogue. Guy killing himself due to retirement (huh?) Filmed somewhere in France where everyone is Afro-Franco (where's that?) Really slow moving; not much plot. The movie could have used some zombies or giant ants in it to fill in the really boring parts (most of the movie). This movie could only be enjoyed by the nerdiest of art nerds or the brain dead. Much worse than ""Manos: Hands of Fate"", and that's saying a lot. Maybe even worse than ""The Room."" Recommended only for the lame."
4,A highlight,"While released during a period of uneven recordings and weird producers you would be wrong to dismiss this album. It garnered renewed and always rare attention for Parker. Solid songs matched by Parker's own production (producing his own work was one of his strongest artistic moves to date) amount to a crafty, whimsical and airy work, where even a cover like Cupid works.MLS has more in common with later Parker rather then Squeezing out Sparks-this marked the transiition. His next solid work after this was Struck by Lighting, a fine companion piece. It's a shame these two aren't domestically released. Howlin' Wind and Sparks would complete a quadrangle of high points."
5,Parker Delivers Listenable Angst,"I've long considered Graham Parker part of my ""little, p*****-off British guy"" phase, during which I listened to a lot of Elvis Costello and related artists. Parker is a cynic, without a doubt, but the heart of a true romantic still beats in his chest. Like Costello, who does not allow his varnish of world-weary cynicism to obliterate his soft side, Parker goes from sharp-tongued social criticism to whistful longing at times in the same breath. All without forgetting how to craft a good solid melody, which makes for music you can listen to even if you're not particularly interested in what it has to say."
3,"Rich in Features, but poor sound quality","This is a decent and reliable phone with nice features, but the sound quality is poor. I've had this phone for about 4 years but use this only as a utility phone only if I have to. Sometimes you can't even understand what callers are saying on the answering machine - you have to play it back several times to try and make out some sounds. OK phone, but the poor sound quality outweighs the features."
2,Jabra Eargels,I was disappointed with the product. I've had these before and what I got looked like them until I tried to put them on the ear piece. It was as if the edge of the earbud had been sliced off. There is suppose to be a rim on the edge that secures the ear piece and that was missing. I don't think these were new and that is what I really wanted. I'll continue to look but don't know if I would use this buyer again.
3,Not a 1951 Brahms 2nd,"Just a point of clarification, though the previous reviewer and the packaging both indicate that this performance of the Brahms 2nd Symphony by Pierre Monteux is from 1951, it is actually from 1945. I compared it to the 1945 2nd I have in the ""Monteux Edition"" and everything from the length of the movements to the poor sound is identical. Couple that with the fact that all of disc one is available on other CDs from RCA/BMG domestic, and the Szeryng VC becomes the only worthwhile part of this two-disc set."
4,A good movie,I remember this movie scaried the crap out of me. I recomend This for 9 and older. There are some parts that will be to scare for kids to handle. It about this penguin mande Hubby who is try to appress Morgania a beautiful female penguin.He is thrown from anartic by drake and evil penguin. Who is ver musucular looks like he was gentical combined with arnold Swarsenager.He teams up with rocko a rock hopper on aquest to return to anartica.
1,WRONG PRODUCT,"After receiving the product, I opened the case, and it was a totally different movie. I needed the video for a classroom presentation, but I got some movie about a monkey."
2,PRETTY INEFFECTIVE TOON,"Not even a score by Gramsy winner Barry Manilow can save this poorly executed animated film. Manilow's songs aren't that memorable and there's too many of them. The story, as thin as spring ice, focuses on Hubie, a stuttering penguin overdone by Martin Short, who has fallen for Marina, a doe eyed penguin whom he wants to present with his pebble on mating day. Of course, Marina is eyed by the loutish brute Drake (Tim Curry) who will do anything to secure her bliss. Hubie is mistakenly thought dead courtesy of the deadly leopard seal but he has merely been whisked away by penguin hunters who want to sell him to the zoo. He manages to escape with tough guy penguin Rocko (James Belushi) and begins a sojourn home to save Marina from Drake's paws. I'm not sure kids will even find themselves able to sit through this hokey and dull cartoon."
1,Horrible animation,"The biggest problem with this movie is the animation. The evil leopard seals, which eat the penguins, are huge. The penguins are smaller than their mouths. Then cut to a scene in the ship Misery where the penguins are one third the size of a human. Which basically means that compared to humans these sea lions are the size of an 8 story building. Fast forward to the scene with the submarine and the leopard seals are normal size. Another stupid thing about this movie is that Rocco the penguin flies. Yeah it's a kids movie, and yeah it was his dream to want to fly, but when he flies to catch hubey and marina he doesn't move his wings. He does this quasi-superman move because he catches them with his hands as they fall off a cliff and then ascends into the sky on will alone. It was very melo-dramatic. I can't think of a worse movie at this time. The reason it got one star is because there are a handful of funny one liners from Rocco."
2,Ehhh,"This team's cartoons are usually very good, but in this one the quality is just not there. The plot doesn't hold my attention, and it doesn't hold my nephews' attention. The songs are also less catchy than I'm used to. I would reccomend skipping this one, whether for your collection or a child's."
4,Fun movie,"The Pebble and the Penguin is a cute movie about a love-struck penguin (Hueby) who gets separated from the love of his life and spends most of the movie try to get back to her. The ""pebble"" is like an engagement ring, and he tries desperately to hang on to it through a series of adventures in order to give it to his love. He is helped along the way by a friend ""Rocko"". A couple negative comments: 1 - Hueby uses a lie to get Rocko to help him find his way home. 2. - The bad guy (Drake) is little bit too mean for toddlers. Overall, it's cute and the songs are fun."
5,one of my favorite childhood movies,"one perfect pebble, just one humble stone <3 teaches an important lesson that looks aren't everything. would definitely recommend it to anyone, but then again it may be too childish for teens or young adults. but definitely will remain one of my favorites."
4,Ideas and Energy about How We CAN be Different at Work!,"Canfield writes an excellent book about the ways in which we _CAN_ be different at work. No matter our level, we don't have to disklike (or even hate) the work that the do or where we do it. This books gives tips, advice and stories of those who have gone before us on this path. By necessity, there is no ""cookie cutter"" guide, so those looking for a absolutely certain remedy will be disappointed. However, this will give those of us who want to try both new ideas and new energy to try and make a difference."
1,how bad can an audio book get ?,"I would give this audio tape 0 stars if I could. This is a total waste of money. The audio book's first lecture is meaningless - self esteem, blah blah blah, and how I overcame all my blah blah. Spend on your money on a book the Dalai Lama wrote on Happiness. You'll get some practical advice in that book unlike this audio tape."
1,Nero 7 Ultra Edition Enhanced,"I received the basic program from Sony with my DVD drive. The basic edition. I could not get it to load on my computer without my computer crashing. So I bought the full Nero 7 Ultra Edition Enhanced version and download the update. On trying to install it my computer it continued to crash (blue screen). I try to get help from the company with their 10 day free tech support. They were of no help, said they were going to e-mail me instructions, which I never received. I've since taking it off my computer and bought the Roxio Easy Media Creator 9. Much better product!"
1,Like Russian Roulette,"Do not buy this program if you have previously had any version of Nero on your computer. I installed the trial version and liked it so I bought the real thing. Big mistake; $80 down the drain. The retail version won't install and now even the trial version won't reinstall. I tried every cleaner on the Nero website and they still leave pieces behind after crashing while looking for a nonexistent file. All tech support can say is ""download the clean tool"". By the previous reviews it looks like I'm not alone. I'm sure there is a class-action coming.Update - May 6, 2008: I installed it on a computer that had never had a previous version of Nero and it appeared to crash during the install. However, I walked away and when I came back, about 15 minutes later, it had finished installing."
1,Bloatware - buy something else,"Early versions of Nero were great: simple, streamlined, and fast. Whatever happened? Nero raised its price substantially and piled on ""features"" that you don't want or need. It takes forever to install, cluing you in that it's going to hog your computer resources. It also uninstalls any previous version of Nero, so there's no going back (it's not possible to buy or download an older version). Even if you use ""custom install,"" you cannot prevent its installation of ""Nero Scout,"" a media search engine that displaced other (more useful) search engines (like Google desktop) that you might have already been using.There are much simpler programs available, some for much less, that offer the same core features. Buy one."
1,Not very impressive so far,"I have ready many reviews and thought I was ready to use this product. So Ibought this last week. I tried burning a slide show to a dvd disc, I got a burn faild message. I removed and reinstalled the software and tried burning again and still failed. Tech support recommended updating my firmware for my recorder and there is no guaranteed that it will fix the problem. I can't get more advice until I do this update. I am not that good with computers so I had to read up what's a firmware is and then tried to find an update for my SONY DVD+-RW DW-Q58A version uds2. I gave up after 2 hours. Does anyone know where I can find the new version to download? and what is the newest version? This product is not for beginners. I will write more if I ever get to use this product."
1,Windows won't shut down after installing this thing,"Once I put this thing up on my windoes XP machine, I get a WMS Idle error every time I try to shud down windows. This cause me to need to manually shut down my machine. I de-installed Nero and my machine now operates properly. Looking for another DVD solution."
4,Nero - Near good,Burns things well but there's too many features in my opinion. This program likes to spread out into everything including my T-Mobile MDA. The mobile software doesn't seem to work very well either. It burns cd's and dvd's alright though.
4,About Nero 7 Ultra Edition Enhanced!,"The Nero 7 Ultra Edition Enhanced is a excellent product....I only wish that I could load .mov videos (that's why i did not give it a 5) but other than that, it is a good product."
3,"Decent Software, LOTS of Bugs","Nero is fine for basic CD and DVD burning, so if that's all you want it will work. On the other hand the suite of software it comes with is less than perfect.Take SoundTrax, the Mix-CD maker which is supposed to let you easily make custom mixes with fades, audio effects, custom track breaks, etc. First, it randomly crashes far too often for a piece of commercial software. Second, and even more problematic given its stability issues, SoundTrax will not save many of the changes made to Mix documents (such as pauses between tracks, and volume effects such as fades and normalization).So, Nero is an OK buy if all you want is basic burning software, but I would not advise buying it for the more specialized software in the bundle -- maybe by Nero 8 they will have found time to work out the kinks."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!,I have never written an online review. I always thought it was waste of time. I am so frustrated with this product that I am forced to write a review on this product so that people know what they are getting into if they are thinking of buying it.This product has never worked from day 1. DVDs burned with this product have trouble playing with DVD systems. Video looks choppy when you are playing.You will be lucky if you managed to burn DVDs. Sometime it will get stuck sometimes for hours and does nothing.They have F'd up customer support. You have to pay if you want to talk to them live. They do have email customer support which is free but they ask you back so many questions that you get fed up and end up calling them. This is the worst piece of S**** I have ever bought! I have never been so frustrated in my life.Please do not go through what I went through!!!!!MuyeenNew York
1,I Want To Go Back To Ultra 6!!!!,"What a terrible upgrade. I'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6. Even though I specifically told it to leave my file associations alone, it changed every one of them. It's a nightmare. I'm still trying to get Nero disassociated with certain file types, to no avail. The backup program is awful, slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6. Overall, Ultra 6 is a much better product. I'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to Nero with instructions on where they can associate it."
1,sucks,"I didnt get what i ordered, they sent me the essentials cd not the program itself, i was very dissapointed, but they just dont want to do anything about this,i returned it,but i will not order from this person again."
4,Great program although a little buggy,"I bought this program so I could put my home videos on DVD. It works very well, allowing you to trim scenes and add your own chapter points wherever you wish. It also comes with a wide variety of picture and audio tools you can use. The only problems I had were when I tried to update it online. I ran into errors and the program appeared to delete itself and not install the new version. I used Windows restore function to go back to where I had originally installed the program and had no problems. I also had one error message when I installed from the disc. The program appeared to be looking for an high-def capable DVD-ROM drive. I just clicked to continue and the program finished installing without any problems."
4,Wow! What a Program!!!,Nero 7 has more features and more capabiity than I ever expected for such a reasonable price. It meets all of my audio and video needs and then some. The challenge will be to discovere and learn how to use the many progams within the program.
3,would of stayed with earlier version,"So, I did not listen to the other reviews about Nero 7. I did find it more difficult to load. Did not let me customize-had to load features that I will never use. It does do a great job for Dvds, but I found it easier to use Roxio for backing up my music cds. I would of stayed with an earlier version (6), if it wasn't for Microsoft vista not supporting version 6."
1,Horrible!,"I bought this mainly as a disk drive back up solution. It turned out to be a huge mistake. No wonder it was discounted so much! The backup software is difficult to use and has an unusually awkward and confusing interface. It also would not allow me to restore the backup onto the partition I had created. It kept creating its own partition to restore into no matter what! There is a checkbox to have it fit the restore into an existing partition, but this never seemed to work. The prompts it uses for you to put in the next disk are non-existant. On both the backup and restore you are left wondering what to do or click. Why doesn't it just prompt you to put in the next disk, etc.... ? The CD/DVD burning software had an equally awkward interface. Doesn't the manufacturer have ANY common sense??????This software should not even be given away, never mind sold! It's an embarrassment."
1,worst customer service ever !!!!,"I purchased nero 8. It doesn't install properly and they have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Over two weeks to get a response to your tech question, or you get to pay $1.29 per minute. I called their regular customer service line and waited on hold until they closed."
1,Terrible Experience,"Full of bugs, lack of technical support-CD and MP3 files skip-can not burn CD's without clicks. Impossible to fix. Don't waste your money!"
5,Best burning suite period,"I upgraded to the 7.0 version when I moved to Vista. Works FANTASTIC. One tip: Before purchasing, I was out reading reviews on this product and there were a couple of posts where users were complaining about the product taking over all media related actions. To avoid this you must read all of the screens while performing install. Towards the end of installation, you will be given a screen to choose which actions you want Nero to automatically handle, if any."
1,DO NOT BUY!,Any company selling a product that does not support the customer with effective and efficient help when needed does not deserve anyones business. The so called customer no-service phone lines are rediculous.I purchased this software as an upgrade to NERO 6 and received a free copy of Photoshop Deluxe 4 with a 1-year free premium membership. All I needed was a security key number that works. After waiting on hold for 32 minutes I was told to call the tech support line [not free] or email them. I've now emailed three times with nothing more than an automated response that someone will be in touch. Ha Ha Ha. I have tried every means to contact this company with no response what-so-ever. Now I've contacted my credit card company to dispute the billing. They will reverse the charge for me.Now I've found that the company is out of Germany. It is my opinion that NERO is going to great lengths to make it very difficult to contact them in any way.
1,Strongly recommend that you look elsewhere,"I have burned or attempted to burn about a dozen DVDs since buying a SONY burner that came with the Nero7 software. For copying entire DVDs, the product works as advertised. For editing and/or compiling videos from different sources and files, the Nero 7 software is tedious, cumbersome, unintuitive, and unreliable (crashes). A loathsome product."
1,6.6 was good this was horrid,"After long and happy service from 6.6 Ultra, I upgraded when I got a new boxto a copy of 7Ultra I bought a while back,then updated.I have to say that 7 (thru 7.5) is the worst bloated thing I have ever used.cleaned it out and went back to 6 expressPositively horrid.8 appears to have all the same problems, if you look at reviewsYOU SHOULDN""T HAVE TO REBOOT AFTER EVERY BURNNew XPpro install, loaded right after browser, so no conflictsseems like the searcher and bloatware is searching for somethingstops and goes back to work after an hour or after rebootLast time I use Nero there are better approaches"
1,"Yuck, Many Problems","I can get this thing to work, but there are so many minor and medium problems, that it's one of the worst pieces of software on my machine.Here are some examples:1. When you choose a number of files to burn to CD, the beginning of the filename disappears. So, for example, if you have ""My First File.wav"" and ""My Second File.wav"", all you'll see is ""File.wav"" and ""File.wav"".2. If you want to use two drives for making multiple CD copies, and you choose to make 5 copies, it will actually try to make 10 copies.3. There's no option for copying from a CD image to a CD, although you can double click on the CD image file to get this done.4. Operations occasionally fail for mysterious reasons.5. The Normalize operation results in a buzzy, overloud track.I think I could list 50 or problems like this."
4,very nice just small,it is a nice gargoyle although it is very light and a bit smaller than i was expecting. overall not bad but a bit overpriced imo.
2,Not the Swellest of Parties,"This recent soundtrack to an Andy Stewart TV special is far less satisfying than the Scottish folk singer's early work. Stewart was only in his 50s when this was recorded, but his hard living and health problems had already crippled his voice. In fact, he was to die just a few years later. Stewart sings many of his most popular songs, and has a few talented guest stars, but his faded voice and the cutesy high-jinks make this a party you'd rather leave early."
5,A Great Collection,"This collection was much better than I expected. Many of the stories in the dozen that make up the collection touched me, made me think, and changed how I look at a few important things in life. The first story, the Orange Fish, was very interesting and I loved the many messages and interpretations that the lithograph brought out in the different characters. The couple in this story undergoes a metamorphosis because of their purchase of a lithograph of an orange fish; the idea that a purchase can tranform a marriage seems preposterous, but Shields makes it believable. 'Hazel' was another one of my favourite stories, about a widow who acquires job skills and confidence and expects to take control of her destiny and realizes that much of what happens in her life and in the lives around her occurs by accident. Another story, 'Times of Sickness and Health' struck a chord with me, as it has a precise poetic quality to it and a magical element."
3,Average,"The HP Photo Inkjet cartridges were of average quality. The vendor deliverd the product promtly. I might make a purchase in the future, but nothing compels me to seek this vendor's product."
3,Runs large,"My skinny toddler wears a size 24 mos. This rash-guard, size 1-2T swallowed her whole. My guess is that I would have to order two or three sizes down to find the right fit for her."
1,do not buy!!!!!,"USB headphones do not work very well, because it is USB, the sound is software driven on my main CPU (athlon +2400) and not hardware based. This causes a very laggy gaming experince. Also, there is a lot of cracking, poping, and hissing noises during game play of any game. I followed directions to the letter but still could not fix this. Also, I did everything according to the FAQ on their website."
2,money already spent,"When I got em one of the channels in 5.1 mode and 3 channels in 7.1 mode did not function. Also, I got ringing feedback during CSS, but I think that may have been from my illuminating keyboard..lame. Overall the sound quality varies from music, movies, and games. I sent them back in for replacement....so hopefully I'll get ones that work. Similar to the first review, since stuff is broke very early on, leaves me with a sinking feeling it can't get too much better. Oh, and that lame 90 day warranty, I could prolly buy another set of headphones with the potential shipping costs of multiple defective headsets.P.S. The mic worked fine though, but it was only 2 days of use."
1,Save your money for something that works,"Another fine example of the current state of product development. Obviously, the designers never tested these in actual use, or have no knowledge whatsoever of acoustics and how speakers work. The microphone is actually attached to the left speaker. Read that last sentence again, and see if you can figure out why that would be a problem. If you turn up the headphones loud enough to hear, the microphone feeds back. You don't even have to be using them. Just plug them in and set them down and they feedback all by themselves. Oh, and the volume controls on the side to not work either. Other than that, these are just fine. Please, feel free to donate your money to another exploitative corporation who are betting that most people are too busy to have the time to demand a refund. The creeps."
2,Broken In Six Months,"I am 31 years old, every game system i ever bought still works and I still regularly use the first ever DVD player and VCR i ever bought. My point is i take care of products I purchase so I can get years of use out of them. Within two weeks of purchasing these headphones the plastic that covers the slide bars broke on each side. I dont have a big head and I never pull them apart more than needed. Within six months of purchase, these headphones were broken into two pieces. Once the plastic covers broke it put stress on them even more until one side completely snapped in two. I will say that while they lasted they never were uncomfortable, even after 8 hour gaming sessions. The sound is good and the mic worked well. I had to give these headphones 2 stars for having a 6 month life expectancy."
2,Mediocre at best... wanted to like it... had to give it away,This was someone I hoped to support since he's from the same hometown but I just can't support the hack. Just wanting to prevent others from wasting their time and money. Don Geronimo is a great comedian if you'd like to find an alternative.
5,Get all three promos,"Again the sound quality on this promo is unmatched by other lives songs from commercially released singles.The song starts off with piano and slowly transforms into whisk drumming and acoustic. Very different rendition of the original comapred to the sleeping beauty version, but nonetheless spectacular."
5,A Perfect Circle is Great!,"This is a great Single. A Perfect Circle live recordings are great such as in the Judith single, great sound quality!Plus the Judith remix is just awsome (I bet you'll like it)..."
4,Progressive Scan and great remote,"This DVD player is nice looking. Very thin and the remote works well. I found the picture to be a little bit grainy on a 57"" Sony widescreen HDTV. I dont know if I expected too much or what. It does look better than my laser disc player, but not much difference between the xbox and the dvd player. I think for the price, you cant go wrong."
1,Pioneer DVDR software suck! - stay away.,Pioneer DVDR software suck! - stay away. they need to actually hire interface designers to redo the software.. its unusable.
5,VERY REWARDING,"If you like solo and chamber music, and have an interest in Czech composers then do not hesitate.The Martinu performances in particular are extremely engaging and very well-recorded. These 3 works contain some of their composer's greatest music, and become especially enjoyable at the hands of these performers. They are rather like a cross between Brahms and Tchaikovsky with more modern elements such as a broader tonal language added. My personal favourite is the 2nd on account of the lyrical beauty of the slow movement.The performances of the Janácek are also rewarding, even if not quite as outstanding as the Martinu. The piano works are very intimate, with a musical language that sometimes recalls the piano music of Debussy and Ravel, but still displaying the Janácek of the sinfonietta and Taras Bulba. The passionate violin sonata brings the string quartets to mind, containing a similarly tragic element. Throughout the recording does full justice to the performances."
2,Excruciatingly salty!!!,"WOW! This is probably why they don't put the nutritional panel on this page; if I had seen that this tiny 7-OZ BOWL CONTAINED 1320mg OF SALT, I would have never bought!Well, of course it doesn't taste BAD (never does anything super-salty taste bad... Fries, anyone?), but the noodles are kindy mushy, and the ""spicy"" sauce is not spicy at all.I don't know what the other reviewer smoked. Or were they paid by Luck's...?I will eat what I bought (it's edible, and I never waste food), but I will not order again."
1,Dull,"Same as Joshuas Night Whispers, no story and illustrations were drab and boring. Now worth the money I spent on it."
3,GJ-Baby,"This album is a testament and a good example of the CHIC influence (tubular bells, strings, violins, harps) on music in the post disco era. The title cut ""Spacer"" and ""Don't Go"" a song with a phrase that is repeated over and over again is actually not bad to me because I love the CHIC beats/sounds. The rest of the music in this compilation I can do without."
5,Great collection for the classical piano lover,"I have a fairly refined ear for good piano technique and wanted a collection of classical pieces that came in an economical box set. Was a bit unsure when I saw that they did not list the interpreters but bought it anyway as it was such a good deal. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised. Excellent playing and a wonderful selection, and what a good deal!"
5,Pure Perfection!,"Rich, full sounding, skillfully played recordings. Included with the 16 CD's is a perfect zipper close fabric case, and a synopsis that both unfolds and fits in the case. Even at list price this CD set is a great bargain.My only criticism is that the highly skilled pianists were not given due credit by publishing their names. Great performers deserve great recognition. They had to work long and hard to achieve such abilities.I purchased my ""The Piano"" set from eBay at half the price. I plan to search eBay for ""The Master"" set and ""The Symphonies"" set also."
3,BEWARE: Not the Original Album,"While ""Restless Heart - Big Dreams"" is a good CD and includes several of their hits - BEWARE! This is not the original 1988 ""Big Dreams In A Small Town"" album. That album included ""Big Dreams in a Small Town"" and ""Bluest Eyes In Texas,"" but also included 8 other great songs such as ""Jenny Come Back"" and ""Calm Before the Storm"" that you won't find here!! This is an encore/Greatest Hits collection, probably put together by the record label (i.e. without the band's creative input) that includes material not only from ""Big Dreams in a Small Town,"" but also ""Wheels"" and the band's debut ""Restless Heart"" album...."
5,amazing,"I own every release john zorn has put out, and this is one of my top favorites. The other previous reviews cover it well, though i would like to say that the one who claims pattons vocal work is not enjoyable is wrong. i find it incredibly enjoyable, and it's more a matter of taste than fact. One Zorn's best pieces."
5,Perfumed Rose Petals,"I agree with the other reviewers on this one. I won't try to sum up what's happening musically, but it's Zorn, so it's polished at both ends - whether frenzy or very melodic. The musicians involved are always a joy to hear, whether with Zorn or their own projects. One other recent release to the Zorn oeuvre worth picking up is The Stone fundraiser album, with Patton and an updated mid-late 60's Miles vibe."
4,Worth it nevertheless,"This has to be one of the greatest collections of songs--French and English that I have ever seen. While there are a couple lame songs, the ones that are good make up for them. Very heavily based on what was popular in France for the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999."
3,Ugly and narrow fit but the quality seems good!,I'm thinking they need to be worn after dark assuming I can wear them at all: so narrow!They certainly feel like a quality product so they should last for a while.Anyway for only $20 or so they shoud prove to be value for money.
5,Great buy,Very good quality 4 the Money. I did have to return the 1st pair for a size saller as they run a size larger.
4,Always buy ECC memory if your computer can use it,"Have you ever been playing a game and in the middle of kicking the snot out of the last boss on the last level and then all of the sudden your computer crashes or reboots? Or maybe you were surfing a cool new site that hadn't yet bookmarked and OOPS your computer crashed. Well, ECC memory may be what you need, but it's not for everyone. First, it's usually a bit more expensive than non-ECC RAM. Second, it's still a fairly high-end feature and some motherboards don't support ECC RAM. My motherboard will accept either type so at first I had the cheapo non-ECC memory and had MANY random crashes, but when I switched to all ECC memory I have a crash maybe once every week or so (that's probably due to Win NT or a buggy video driver). I say bite the bullet and get the ECC memory."
2,"A Curiosity , Vital for T.H. White Completists","So, we learn that T.H. White's ultimate design for his saga was to bring things full circle. The final book takes Arthur underground to meet with Merlyn, and some animals for a grand debate about the nature of humankind. This is a pretty tedious read...long on ideas and short on action. This certainly doesn't come across as a final version of the text. Things that White normally nails, like characterization, aren't always on the mark here.Of course, there are some chunks of prose that are absolutely brilliant. We're talking T.H. White, after all. Things are enlivened by Arthur's trip to the worlds of the ants and the geese. (However, I feel these episodes functioned better in Book 1.)Editorially, I found this edition tantalizing but unsatisfying. A highly personal introduction provides details about White, but fails to explain some basics -- how did the goose and ant segments ultimately ended up in Book 1? How and why was the text ""lost?"" Frustrating."
3,Not the once and future king,"This book is well written and not too hard of a read, but if you are looking for that something that was in the once and futrue king you won't find it here."
2,What a disappointment....,"T. H. White uses this book as a platform to discuss his political views and WWII. That might have worked, except that any story or character development takes a distant back seat to the political commentary. It's kind of a thin book. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not as good as I thought...,"Well, I have to read this book for school. I really thought I was going to like it because I normally like Old English Literature. But, this book just goes into sooooooooooo much detail. It drags on forever and ever and seems to never end.Just thought I'd share.."
1,Click for great reasons why you should'nt read this book!,"""The Book of Merlyn"" is about the understanding of how cruel the common man is to nature. The main characters are King Arthur, who depends on other people, and Merlyn the great magician. I think that the book was very boring. It dragged on and on with unnecessary detail. ""The Book of Merlyn"" had small events like King Arthur turning into an ant, but it didn't have any major events throughout the whole story. This book had unrealistic characters, such as animals with human characteristics. This was not an enjoyable book to read because of the reasons I have listed above."
5,Sharper Image Ionic Breeze Quadra Air Purifier,"I had one of these for over 18 years and it ran constantly. I would rotate the permanent filters every month and clean them with soap and water. No need to buy filters, these filters are permanent. Dont put in dishwasher, wash by hand as I did. Unfortunately the nylon wires inside broke and could not be repaired, nor could I find anyone to repair it in my local area. It really removed the smell of dog and cigarettes from the house. Many people told me they could not smell dog or cigarettes and I have 4 dogs."
3,"good product, would recommend","Good product, but the cut out job is poor. I had to take my pocket knife and cut.around the edges better to Make it smooth and even. Installation is frustrating. Never got them put on because u need to drill holes in the wheel house by taking the tires off or ur drill won't fit between the tires and body of truck. Eventually I will get them installed but I need a lift or floor jack. Basically it is worth purchasing if u can do all the labor needed yourself."
4,The Beethoven 1st,"This WAS a great recorded performance, but in the re-mastering, the 1st and 3rd movts of the Beethoven seems sped up and the balance as engineered between the orchestra and the piano over favors the orchestra. I have long ago lost my original LP, alas."
1,Missing Movies,"I cannot comment on the movies themselves because lo and behold the movies were not in the three dvd carrying case. What a big disappointment on Sunday movie night to open a present and find that it contained nada. True lies, indeed."
1,Give us anamorphic!!!!,"Why can't FOX simply come up with an anniversary edition or other double-dip disc that has a TRUE anamorphic transfer of True Lies? TL is probably my favorite Schwarzenegger flick, and has remained popular, so why does it get the crapola treatment from FOX? Once again, FOX, just give us an anamorphic widescreen version of True Lies on DVD, it can't be that difficult to accomplish!!!"
5,A must read in memoirs of special operations memoirs,"Great book, insight into what it took to build the teams and how stupid the bureaucrats and politically minded military officers can be (not a surprise to any veteran).A must read for those who follow the Navy SEALS exploits through the years.It is also one source, all such memoirs are best understood in the context of one of many views and opinions.from the dozens of SEAL memoirs I have read, Boehm is revered by real SEAL warriors.The negative review of this book is obviously someone who served with him but was a bean counter not a warrior."
5,Very exciting to read,This book has been one of the most interesting of anything I have read. Talk about exciting if at times brutal facts how chain of command works and why we the public wonder how certain things can happen. I just wish Roy had written more! But never to fear I found Marcinko.
5,They only made one Roy Boehm -- he kept the plans and mold.,"There is no question that First Seal will go down as probably the best book ever written about the formation of the SEALs. Without Roy's drive and vision, things might have turned out differently. I would have to say that anyone even vaguely interested in Naval Special Warfare HAS to read this book. Great job Roy, and I am sure you have more to write about. Keep 'em coming."
2,Great in the beginning slow at the end,"It was a good book until the Vietnam War. Then he no longer talked about the United States SEALs, but some Vietnam SEALs he was training. The book would have been a good book if he had stuck with the United States SEALs. There are better books about the SEALs. I myself happen to like COMBAT SWIMMER by Captain Robert A. Gormly much better than this one!!"
1,untitled,"This book is a package of distorted history and countless inaccuracies, bursting with profanity, wrapped in fiction masquerading as fact."
4,Beautiful and moving,"I rented this without knowing anything about it other than the blurb on the back and I'm glad I did. A quiet, beatifully shot movie with flowing words, this movie made me want to find out more about the author of the original book, John Fante. It isn't often that a movie makes me want to read the book (and I'm a big reader!), but this one has a charm that grows on you and will stay with you. It is definitely a bleak portrayal of life in the 30's in LA and the difficulty of being of another ethnic or religious group but the message of love bridging those differences is well done. It was nice to see Colin Ferrell in a differenty type of role than he usually plays and Salma Hayek is luminous as always. So what if the a lot of the critics hated it? Watch it and judge for yourself. If you like words and flowing language and well-written material, this film will suit you."
2,This movie took me to the woodshed!,"If there is such a thing as ""cinematic hell"", then this flick has found its proper place to languish for all eternity! This is, by far, one of the worst flicks that I have ever viewed! I'm giving it 2 stars only for Salma Hayek's nude scenes which could not salvage this piece of cinematic trash. In fact, Ms. Hayek is the only redeeming value in this trash flick. The movie was shot in South Africa on a really fake set of 1930's Los Angeles. The set has one street, one trolley car and a bunch of antique autos, with a bunch of equally phony extras looking like they should be cleaning the street of horses**t! That's right, horses pulling wagons! WTF! I'm not getting into the acting because there wasn't any! How this piece of a bombastic screenplay made to film (a waste of celluloid!) is a mystery to me! Stay away, stay far away from this piece of film carrion!"
2,Sadly Not a Good One,"I watched the movie hoping it was one of those good 'no guns, no car crash' movies from both Farrell and Hayek; but turned out to be a bad choice. The story is extremely fictional (says a Mexican woman living in the United States) and I know the time period was different, but no woman gets over or forgives such strong racist insults from an Italian man who wants to be white. The characters were not integral throughout the movie, and please.. no one has ever died from too much smoking marijuana; and Mexicans do other drugs as well. Bad stereotypes, bad performances, bad actors. Some pretty images, but at a very high price."
2,Bites the Dust,"The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is nice looking. The cinematography, production design and of course the actors are all very easy on the eyes. It is unfortunate then that the story is uninvolving and actually very ridiculous in parts. I think Colin Farrell is a bit miscast also. It was hard for me to buy him as being inexperienced with women. Donald Sutherland is totally wasted as an alcoholic neighbor. Why he even appears in this movie is a mystery to me. Another character, a woman who shows up out of nowhere, is also less than convincing. Finally, the movie is fatally overlong and will have you squirming in your seat."
1,this is the best?,"While the appeal of the 'oxford' name and the attractive price/page ratio make this book seem like a good deal, I found it extremely difficult to get any useful information out of this book. The authors give their opinions on subjects, before (or in many cases, in place of) giving any coherent summary of it. Just for example, try to figure out who Draco was. If you don't already know, this book is not going to tell you. The writing style is not especially clear, either. If this is one of the best texts available, I can see why nobody learns classical history anymore."
2,White Cane review,"This is a nice cane, but the cord is short and not enough strong to last one folding.To improve:use the same cord from wirst loop, to end of the cane shaft.Use a stronger cordWhen I first folding the cane, the cord ripped apart because the cord wasn't long enough and it was too weak."
3,Bratz Hair Studio,This toy is creative and for children that love pretend play will be just as good as any other similar type of toy. My child only used it for a short time then went off to something else.
4,K.T.Oslin - This Woman CD,I was extremely pleased w/quality and how quickly I rec'd the album. It is a very old recording (I had it on tape) but one of my all time favorites. Thank you.
4,A Beginner's Guide,"I found Stone's Handbook of Language and Literacy to be a very well documented compilation of studies dealing with various aspects of language and literacy development. This was a challenging tome as an introduction to the subject matter. Learning the ""language"" is always demanding. However, I really appreciated the extensive references, and the overviews of research done on the various topics."
2,Not too fortunate - -,"This is a pot-boiler. Implausable plot and unbelievable events. Other than that it is just dated. OK - Lady looks for her missing husband in Hong Kong, meets dangerous people who actually help her. Lots of threats and narrow escapes - but only the Brits come off as heros.Gann wrote much better books -- ""Fate is the Hunter"", ""Gentlemen of Adventure"", ""In the Company of Eagles"". Try one of those."
2,Not great,"I have owned this mouse for about 2 years, but it is a battery drainer. The biggest problem, however, is the sides (where your thumb and pinkie finger rest). The sides are made of rubber and the adhesive that was used to attach it to the mouse did not last long. It worked well for about 6 months."
5,very good book,"This book can be used in beginning ESL/EFL classes for reading, writing and grammar. It's integrated in nature, so it improves the students' skills in several ways. You learn the vocab in content and then practice it by writing and comprehension questions. It is a really good book."
4,"A Teacher's Review of ""Klondike and Snow""","Anyone who was fascinated by the PBS program on these two polar bears will enjoy this book. It tells the story of their early years before being transfered to the Florida zoo. The photos are amazing! I've used this book as a resource with K-6th graders, and all ages have loved it. The text under the photos is very small and in blue, making it difficult to read, but the main text is fine, and otherwise the book is wonderful. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in these two very special bears."
3,"Not bad, just not great.","I actually just finished reading this book and I found it to be a fairly fun read. Ms. Eilers has a breezy style and an obvious sense of humor. Unfortunately, most of this book is pure fluff-how many of us really need to be told to bathe daily and wear clean clothes? Duh. If this is information you need, you'll probably require more help than you can get from a book. It's common sense, folks. The information offered is hardly earth shattering, but if you've got a few hours to kill and you're in the market for a bit of fun, then by all means, give it a read. But unless you're a real newbie to the Pagan path, there's not much to recommend. Harmless."
3,"Not bad, but.......","Well written, but it often seems to be aimed at readers in their teens. Much of the information contained therein was not appropriate for a mature adult. Learned little."
2,not worth your time or money,"This book is less than fluff. It is a waste of time and money. Not only is there nothing new or useful here, it is filled with things that are so ""common sense"" you will find it ridiculous to see it spelled out in print. If you are new to paganism, spend your time and money on books by Scott Cunnigham, Margot Adler, and other highly-reccommended authors, and skip this one."
1,Not easy to use,"By ""easily folds down"" I thought my 80 yr old mother would actually be able to do it...No, you have to clip the bar into place. I couldn't even do it. And if not done right my mom would end up on the floor! Not impressed. I was really hoping it was a sliding bar that moved back and forth but beware, it isn't!"
4,"Recommended, but imperfect.","I liked the book, but it could and should have been stronger. It's wonderful on the grounds that it reinforces the idea that storytelling is possible with a simple image or sound. i.e. a match cut can actually ADVANCE the story in a way no dialog can. However, the summaries of the 100 principles are a bit short. . .making for a weak and sometimes confusing explanation of the concepts. I was also unimpressed with her claim of '100' conventions when numbers 45-49, for example, are all about the visual match cut. Overall, however, I enjoyed her insightful catalog of film techniques that offer a strong potential for film communication."
3,good overview,i like Master Shots much better - this is more of a general overview of film making - not really a guide
2,Kindle version stinks,I own the book but got the kindle version and the photos and layout don't work at all on an ipad. Very hard to follow. Get the book itself not the e book.
2,TOO BASIC,"The title misrepresents the content; the information is limited and over stated. If you don't already know these conventions from the most basic viewing of films, this book won't help."
3,More than I was expecting,"The book is very thorough about what it explains. Maybe more so than what I was expecting. Not a film buff personally, it uses examples from movies, which are helpful, but only if you are aware of those movies and have seen them. I was hoping to learn more about storytelling for shooting short videos, and this book offers a bit more to chew on than I was expecting."
4,Excellent book for understanding the art if cinematic storytelling.,"This is a fantastic book for anyone wanting to understand the art of cinematic storytelling. I have been doing production for over 18 years and was able to either reconfirm what I already know along with be reminded of what I forgot. This book is formatted to easily digest the concepts. Fred Meek - MindBOX Video Productions Austin, TX [...]"
3,Flawed format. Wait for DVD!,"I certainly agree with the existing reviews regarding content, and have nothing to add in this regard.HOWEVER, there are two problems:1. The book measures 7 1/2"" tall and 11"" wide. This makes it hard to hold and fits poorly on the reference bookshelf where it belongs.2. The book mentions an upcoming DVD. This would a MUCH better format than book.This book tries to illustrate various cinimatographic points with still shots from exemplary movies. Sometimes these still shots cannot illustrate the point adequately, while a video clip would be TREMENDOUS at illustrating the point. (For example: various transitions: How in the heck can you illustrate transitions with still photos?!)WAIT FOR THE DVD. It should be TREMENDOUS,and well worth the purchase."
4,A Solid Shelf Reference,"As a Line producer/Unit Production Manager (DGA) in the film industry, I wish more first time directors - and even seasoned ones - had books like this sitting on their shelves. They might learn a few more techniques about planning shots and informing the crew to make for a more efficient, cost-effective production. That time and money could always be used to make the film better in another aspect. Unfortunately, some directors believe that giving information to the Keys and the crew gives away their Directorial vision. They are 'organic' directors which means that they have the brains of a potato. Sharing the vision gets a better vision from the Keys and the crew. Worthwhile Reference."
4,great book,"usefull to discover a lot of ideas of movie ""telling"" , really simple and clear a book usefull for writers and directors, gives you an opportunity of meeting a lot of good scripts and visual idea."
3,OK.,"This book was entertaining at best. I love Evelyn's previous works. I wish this one would have explored more the relationship with the ex-husband after what happened. He just seemed to fade away. The ending was surprising, discovering what really happened the day of the murder."
2,weak,If you like Evelyn Palfrey then you will automatically buy this one. If you are a new reader try another Palfrey book instead. This one is weak. The characters are too thin. Everyone is more of a type than a fully described characters. The author uses cliches as a short cut to moving the story along. The situation is contrived. There is too much drama in poor Audrey's life for one short book and the loose ends are not tied up at the extremely unsatisfying end.
4,Another great sequel,"Audrey's story is fantastic. It is touching to read such thoughtful mature writing with mature characters. Evelyn has done it again. Malcolm, what a sensual man. Malcolm knew what he wanted and got just what he asked for and more. Audrey was a very strong and thought provoking women. Many would have done it this way and that way. However, Audrey laid it out for ex-husband like a PRO would do. All the characters in the book were great and something else. However, Evelyn left me hanging about Audrey's daughter. My big guest is that this trilogy isn't over yet. Bring it on Evelyn !!!!!"
5,Another page-turner by the author,"Enjoyed this book as much as I did ""The Price of Passion."" This book has it all - suspense, mystery, & sensual romance. Author does a good job catching your attention in the first couple of chapters (drama at the beginning - once again) & carries you on a roller coaster ride throughout the book, but manages to bring you down safely at the end of the book. It's a must read!"
1,make the party last by james last,The audio quality of this cd is terrable. Sounds like poor am radio. James last is a great talent. The recording quality is very disapointing
4,Upbeat with a chorus,Catchy selections and similar to Rock and Roll Party by James Last. If you like a chorus singing along with the orchestra you will like this album. But if you want straight orchestra instrumental then select a different James Last album as he has some good ones.
3,"As a convenience, it's good to have for the price","Hard to watch and doesn't receive many stations......BUT...It's great to have as a backup for storms (for instance if you want to watch weather reports while you're hunkered down in the closet after the power goes out). It's also nice to take camping if you're near a station or otherwise need to catch a favorite TV show on the road in the car (provided, of course, you're not driving).Great to have now that you can get them under $30."
4,Useful Reference,Although the prices are somewhat out of date this book is still a very useful reference for the collector of American military collectibles. It is not a reference for the collector of Nazi militaria as the other two reviewers seem to suggest.
2,Out of date prices and information,"This book is seriously out of date, and is a waste of time and money for the collector. Ron Manion is apparently an expert on Nazi items, that what his auction mostly sells, but that's about it. This book will get the serious collector in a lot of trouble by using it as a reference."
5,Best Hawaiian album ever,I owned this album decades ago and just repurchased it for my kindle fire. This album is my favorite all time album from Gabby and my favorite all time Hawaiian artist.
4,Classic Stott,"He focuses on about 40 of the Psalms. Each treatment is rather brief, but he packs good insights in most every time. This is classic Stott -- theologically rich, practically oriented, concise, clearly written. This is a must have for any study of teh Psalms. It often has been my favorite work on certain psalms. I use Derek Kidner (Tyndale set) for dependable reference. Boice is often very helpful though uneven and sometimes irrelevent (a tad less Christocentric than you'd hope); James Mays (Interpretation series) is wordy and often too critical of the text, but often original; CS. Lewis -- spotty but often wonderful; Joseph Addison Alexander -- long, dry, dated, but very learned and theological; Eugene Peterson's Answering God -- nota commentary, but wonderful inisghts. If I had just two, I'd pick Kidner and Stott."
3,Must lose a lot in translation??,these stories are not only boring but filled with awful people. It must be that something is lost in translation as no stories could be so cold calculating and without any human emotion. Bland at best. The book would not make one want to know or travel to such a place. Cruel and cold ..One only wonders what happened to the author??
5,"O""Reilly Factor for Kids",Christmas present....good quality at a good price. Can;t go wrong with anything by Bill O'reilly.Nice addition to our growing library for grandchildren.
1,Bill Could Have Done Better (And I'm a Big Factor Fan),"Boy oh boy, as a father with kids who regularly watch the Factor I was looking forward to this book. But I have to tell you: it's a disappointment! Poorly written, little actual advice of a substantive nature, more platitudes and homilies that you could have written for Bill yourself. This one really looks like Bill is milking a cash-cow to death, and with the economy the way it is, we could all spend our money more wisely than purchasing this book. I hope that doesn't make me a ""pinhead."""
1,Factor for kids misses the mark completely.,"Factor for kids misses the mark completely.As someone who watches a lot of Bill O'Reilly, I can't say how much I was surprise by this book. What was he thinking? The factor is a political show for adults. Trying to do a tie in book for kids based on the factor is the dumbest thing ever! Didn't he consult with anybody? O'Reilly is a great success and should have had enough connections to pull this off, or at least be warned off of trying this disappointing idea.Trying to slog through this book was just painful. It is like advice from grandpa trying to be hip. I really can't imagine any kids being so into Bill O'Reilly that they would want to try and drag themselves through this dry read. It has no real insights and is really and idea who's time has not come."
5,Smart Advice: Helpful for Parents and Students Alike,"As a college professor with 3 children and 5 grandchildren, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it heartily to parents wanting what's best for their children. A lot of the advice in this book might be considered ""common sense"" but really, it isn't all that common at all, considering the way many parents raise their children today (ways which, in my humble opinion, do much harm to their children's potential for future success).If you have a child in high school or college, I highly recommend another book entitled ""How to Ace Your Way Through College and Still Have a Life."" It's the best college survival/success guide to come along in years, and like Mr. O'Reilly's book, shares smart, straightforward, sage advice.Dr. Henry R. ToofCambridge, MA"
2,"Ok, with little enthusiasm","My son and I read the book together. We read a chapter each day then discussed it. He thought it was well done and understood it for the most part. He said he learned some good things and hoped to utilize them. The book was ok.I agree with him; it was ok, with little enthusiasm. Straight forward material and to the point. Bill would give us ""his story"" relating to each chapter so the kids could relate. This is by no means ""the"" survival guide, but a helpful book on subjects such as: friends, bullies, divorce, smoking, money, cheating, sports, health, work and many others. Of course the parent makes the best teacher.Wish you wellScott"
1,falafel!,"I give this book 1 falafel. There was no advice in this book about not sexually harassing your employees and co-workers. Even a kid knows that's not cool. I hope Andrea Mackris is enjoying her money. I also hope someday those tapes she made, see the light of day."
1,A waste of 20 bucks...,"As a kid, I can say this book was pointless. I didn't help ANYTHING (well...nothings wrong anyway). I got VERY VERY VERY bored reading this book, and I found that his advice was more non-existant then my parents, and the only value in this was pretty much in the stories he tells about himself as a kid. If your neice or nephew or son or daughter etc. says the like the book, ask them if they're actually reading it. I wasn't. Save your money, and don't let a book parent your kids."
1,It was only a matter of time before O'Reilly wrote a children's book.,"After all, he has the mental capacity of a child! It's not surprising to see him write a book geared towards sixth graders because apparently, that's the same grade level of logic that he utilizes on his tv show.I'm not sure why this book was made. O'Reilly has a heavy-handed writing style and this certainly won't translate well to a book geared towards youngsters. The book is a summary of his beliefs which have been elucidated at length to adults.Rather than try to poison a youngster's mind with rigid political beliefs, people like Bill O'Reilly should let youngsters enjoy their youth before they reach adulthood and have to deal with O'Reilly's ilk."
2,A classic tomb for the ages,"I think Bill O'Reilly is a paragon of American culture and is needed to shine the light of intelligent and thought provoking insights into the dark crevices of the liberal elistes minds. I feel honored that such a man would take the time from selling Bill O'Reilly coffee mugs and door mats on his web page to write a book that could play such an important roll in my son's life, however I was disappointed that the book did not contain a section dealing with telephone etiquette."
1,Keep This Man Away From Kids!!!!,"This man may have the most popular news show in America but that is because he appeals to simple war mongering Americans. He does his upmost to undermine the standards of the American press. Don't buy this book and if you see him near any school yards, call the police immediately!!"
1,Hey Kids!,"Do you want to know how to be Bill O'Reilly? Just follow these steps: 1) Shout ""SHUT UP!"" any time someone says something you disagree with. 2) Accuse anyone who doesn't follow your opinions of ""spin"". 3) Refuse to directly answer anyone who claims that you lie and distort the truth. 4) Tell your friends over and over that a rap CD was released this week with offensive lyrics (GASP!). 5) Print out a bunch of jackets and caps with your name on it, followed by the word FACTOR. 6) Constantly remind those around you to buy your books, jackets, and caps even after they look bored. 7) If all else fails, keep shouting ""SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!"" And that's all you need to do to be just like good ol' Bill!"
2,parent disappointed with this book,"As a ""Factor"" watcher and conservative, I was disappointed with the book. I have 4 kids and I am trying to pass on our morals and values. Bill is smug in the book (yes, he's a bit smug on tv, too). I didn't like the 'do as I say, not as I do' attitude. He shares a lot of what he did wrong growing up, and says not to do it. I don't like that approach. How about sharing what to do that is right for the right reasons and leaving your bad examples out. Glad I read it before my kids so they don't read it."
1,It sucked,"If there was an option for 0, i would have given him that. His advice is not good for adults and it goes without saying that he is attempting to corrupt the next generation."
1,Stick with the kids books BO,"B.O. should ""stick"" with childrens books. They are easily influenced and except everything they hear. The truth stops here BO"
1,Dislike,"Do not read this book or waste your money on it. Buy an icecream instead, much better spent money.Keep trying Bill."
3,Pretty Good,It has its good points. In particular is suggestions about preventing drug use. Its best feature is that it promotes good discussion between kids and parents.
5,Look beyond the crazy liberal ideologues,"This book is great for your kids. The trial will take care of itself, and the mocking should eventually turn into apologies, but they won't. Just like Al Franken didn't. O'Reilly is the most honest, fair and balanced journalist at work today, and it is a must that your kids get to see him in action. They'll be better people for it. If America ever loses this guy, it will be a great loss."
5,Pinheads,"Hmm...I see the left-wing blog master has ordered his subjects to flood this site with bad reviews, and like the mindless robots they are, they have obeyed. Is this the best you can do? Can you do anything CONSTRUCTIVE? Why don't you use your stupendously brilliant writing talents to write your own book? Enjoy the Kool-aid, you pathetic little pinheads.P.S. You could try actually reading this book--you might like it."
1,I don't agree with many of the points,"Look I used to listen to O'Reilly very regularly. When Bush was in power, he could do nothing wrong, now Obama can do nothing right. The bottom line is that Obama is faithfully continuing all of GW policies! Come on Bill, give us something real"
1,Read it if you want to understand Bill but talk to your kids if you want to understand them,"""Kids- consider sharing this book with your parents - they'll understand you better."" Oh really Reilly? If you read this book you'll know more about Bill and that is all. His ""straight talk"" is just his regurgitated opinion, based on his experiences and presented as doctrine. It's a mixed bag of conservative and liberal views and reads like a first draft of a high school creative writing assignment - written during lunch hour."
5,Right ON!,"Tell your kids to put down the video game controller, turn down the crap music, and turn off MTV... It's time for kid's to get some reality!"
2,BILL'S PHOTOS AND PLATITUDES,"The no-spin zone master's latest venture into advice for kids is disappointing. Platitudes, and self-serving phrases abound. Yet no real substance is offered to help parents and their children face and conquer the immense challenges which assault them daily.Read Rick Warren's books or Harold Klemp's,""Youth Ask A Modern Prophet About Life, Love, and God"", if you really want to help your children.I like Bill O'Reilly and watch his show faithfully. He is usually insightful and informative, but this book misses the mark. He should continue to write for adults. That is his realm of expertise."
1,Politics to kids?,I mean really. How lame can one get?Get a life Bill. your days are numbered! A disgrace to the Irish!
5,Help Your Kids Stand Up Straight,"Here's a book that will drive liberals crazy--suggesting ways for kids to take responsibility, think for themselves and do their own work. If you live in a big city or the suburbs, wake up and realize how many parents do their kids' homework for them. Reilly's old-fashioned values are a welcome antidote to the culture of coddling we've created. You might even enjoy this book if you're a liberal who wants your kids to be tough-minded and independent. On a far different note, I am also a big fan of ""I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,"" by Bruce Stockler, which shows that a Dad can be the best caregiver in a family. Also a funny, honest and emotionally compelling read."
1,A Dependable Emetic,My dentist left this book in the waiting room.I spent 20 minutes with the bizarre ramblings of this self-important hairball.Now I have a new dentist.
1,Arrogance and Fluff,"I am not going to get into a major discourse on this book.Let's just put it this way...O'Reilly once again spews forth his opinions and like his other books, proves that he is all talk and no walk (read: experience).Plus, I love how he instructs kids on how to behave in this book then fails to mention the sexually explicit book he wrote for adults!!! What a hypocrite!!!!!!!!This book was pumped out quickly and without care just to make a buck. There are much better books out there that cost less and are written by people with the education and experience needed."
1,O'Reilly - The Filth Factor,"If you want your children turning into immoral degenerates and sexual deviants, this book tells you how to do it step by step"
5,Great Book!,"Mr. O'Riley did a great job on his book for kids! It helped me alot with bullies and lots of other things. I also love his 'My Story' too! I watch his tv show with my parents and I think he is right on his veiws. I don't know why that some people don't like this book, but I do!"
1,Crappy book,first of all I'm a 16 year old guy and my grandperents got me this for christmas. (Most likely to turn me into a republican.) I think that Bill shouldn't tell kids how to live when he is one of the most rasist and hateful people on this earth.
1,AVOID BRAIN WASHING YOUR KIDS WITH THIS NEO-CONSERVATIVE!,"Every time I think I might get something from this demagoguing idiot, I end up extremely disapointed. For as many people that this guy gets to be in front of you start to wonder what kind of dirt does this man have on Fox news producers to keep him on the air waves. Chalk this one up to another disapointing book! DO NOT BUY AND WASTE YOUR KINDLE CREDIT OR FIAT CURRENCY ON! YOU ARE WARNED!"
5,A must for your teenager,O'Reilly writes with much insight into teenage growing problems and how to counteract and solve said problems. Should be required reading for all adolescents.
1,There is a REASON why this price has dropped.,"The advice he gives to children in this book for ages 13 (based on the bad language included) to 14 (any older teens would just blow him off) is just as pedestrian (meaning for those who are not able to drive or ride a bike), and pedantic (meaning he acts as though he has all of the answers though clearly he has few that were not soon proven incorrect or at least wrong-headed). His advice here is just as much based on informed opinions (NOT) as the op/ed advice that he gives to adults in those few misled households which actually welcome his TV show. I guess that's why Amazon has had to drop their price so low to ditch their supply of these books instead of paying the recycling costs or just burning these hardbacks as biomass. I don't know how anyone can stand to listen to him for more than 5 minutes."
1,Shouldn't there be a Warning sticker?,"This turgid volume of supposed straight arrow advice serves one useful purpose: as a perfect illustration of the Right's customary attitude of ""Do as I say, not as I do"". For people like Bill O'Reilly, the things THEY do wrong are ok because they are Republicans. When Democrats do the same thing, it's a different story.O'Reilly's parents' generation saluted the flag, kept their noses clean, worked hard and went off obediently when Uncle Sam called. That all made sense then. Bill in this book evokes that simpler, straighter time in his admonitions to the young. Problem is, he talks the talk and doesn't walk the walk. So who can have any respect for him?"
1,Why?,What a terribly written book.Must have been sleeping when he wrote it.A shame he let working people spend money on this.
1,Is there any child who wants this book?,"Come on Bill. No one likes your books. I know your reading this article because you never shut up about how good your books are. Well I picked this one up. God Almighty. Why would you write a kids book or a family book? Especially one as horrifically and disgustingly dull and stupid as this one. Are there any families on this Earth who sit down every night and open up your stupid facist book for kids? Does any child ask Santa for a Bill Oreilly book? Is anyone's last wish to meet you? Of course not. You're a pig headed facist aristocrat. Even if you would let liberals argue with you without cursing them off, I would at least respect you. In conclusion, you should never write another book and beg Americans forgiveness for the hours of horrible and facist programming you organize."
1,O'Reilly has opinions,Too much O'Reilly opinion and talk as though he is some kind of authority. The one cent that I paid for the book was about right. I don't dislike Bill I just get tired of his self promotion.
1,No spin - yeah right!,"Why anyone would subject their children to the hateful, narrow minded views of this media bully is beyond me. Why does this man have even one fan? His ""no spin zone"" motto is the biggest lie on a 'news' network riddled with them. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad."
1,Child Slavery,"The prospect of the serfdom of others is much easier if one is inculcated into it at an early age. The obfuscation of the true motivations of the richest of the corporate capitalists will have mommy and daddy come off looking like a shiny new silver dollar to the kids, no matter how many people they have to bleed how hard to get the new beamer. This is a great follow up to Bill's coloring book ""You are Right to be Rich"". Just as tasty as endangered frogs'legs."
4,Great addition to the Port Leo series....,"a great Texas author, Abbott writes about fictional Port Leo like it's a town we all know and love. This is a very good story, about modern day pirates and treasure hunters, featuring Abbott's recurring main character, JP Whit Moseley, an irreverent judge/coroner for fictional Encinas County. Whit's partner and friend, Gooch, part mercenary part softie, also makes an appearance late in the book. An elderly couple is found murdered on their beach front property, which is what starts the story off, but soon their murder is only one piece in a very convoluted puzzle that includes buried treasure by the legendary pirate Jean Lafitte, various thugs/treasure hunters that stop at nothing to find a rare emerald, and the kidnapping of a police detective on the high seas. What I really liked about this book is a) the strong character development and b) the true surprise ending. This is a nicely-paced mystery and a book I'd recommend."
1,Total Misfire,"Plowing through this book and hoping, (against hope as it turned out), that at some point it would gain traction and my interest, I reached the ending and realized I'd simply wasted most of an afternoon ..... even if it was a rainy one. A multitude of haphazardly developed characters centered around a double murder, a kidnapping and a treasure hunt can't disguise the lack of a coherent or entertaining plot in this book. The ""bad"" guys are straight from the comics and the ""good"" guys are even tough to take. Edgar nominee aside, I missed the magic in this one."
2,Two and a half stars !!!,"It might have just been me, but I couldn't keep the characters separate! It might be because they all seemed so cardboard and boring. The evil guys are just plain whimps, the plot (pirate's treasure) could have been exciting but here it seemed weak and boring. It's buried on a modern day beach front 6 feet deep, no erosion on this beach, no people running around with metal detectors on this beach that has long been rumored to be holding Lafitte's treasure??? The whole book was a real task to read, maybe as a short story it would have been entertaining, but toward the middle of the book, you frankly just don't care anymore!!!!"
3,Can no one be trusted?,"Lots of action, but stretches credibilty more than the last episode. Whit Mosley is an interesting character and is going to be fun to continue with. Pirates and betrayal enough for all."
5,Excellent overall for home woodwork & professionals too,"This Construction Manual was well worth the price for a used book because it could save hundreds of dollars, for the average person as well as the professional.I found the writing level was excellent. With the diagrams, I could understand what is needed, as a laymen, but for the finish carpenter-in-training, all the angles and instruments are there too.VERY thorough on this subject, with chapters on Porch Trim, Stair Layout, Stair Rails, Base and Ceiling Molding, Wood Flooring, Siding, Door Trim, Window Sash and Trim, Windows and Frames, Gutters and Downspouts, Cornices and Rakes, Cabinets and Joinery, Ceiling Tile and Suspended Ceilings, Wood Shingle Roofing, Composition Roofing, Door Bucks and Frames, Fitting and Hanging Doors, Prefabricated Window Units, Interior Wall Covering, and (very valuable to find) Estimating Finish Carpentry."
3,Nice collection of songs of the Mighty Five et al,"This CD sounds like a recording of a graduate recital and I can't take too much of Linn's voice, but she certainly should get an ""A"" for programming this collection.There are songs of the Mighty Five Russian composers: Borodin, Cui, Balakirev, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, and well as others who were their contemporaries or were influenced by them.I particularly like the inclusion of some songs I don't often hear, like the Complaint of the Bride, and From My Tears, along side the chestnuts like None, but the Lonely Heart, Hopek, The Sea Queen, and others.Worth it for the recordings of the songs not often heard. For the chestnuts, there are better recordings."
1,Worst movie ever?,"I loved Creepshow. I thought Creepshow II was fun.Creepshow III just sucks.It has nothing to do with the originals and even the vignette format is barely adhered to. Without George Romero and Stephen King, the Creepshow series can't work. DO NOT watch this."
1,Doesn't even deserve 1 star,This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen!! I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't let you give anything below 1 star. Otherwise I would have given it a zero. The lack of variety in scenery and low bugdet mentality on this movie was so obvious. Any moron can tell that this entire movie was filmed on the back lot of Universal Studios Hollywood before King Kong burned down!! That's what had me laughing so hard. I felt like I was on the backlot tram tour the entire time I watched this movie!! Don't waste your money on this one...even if you get a free copy of it...send it back!!!
1,Bad beyond belief,"I had no real expectations of this film, other than it be a horror film and stay true to the roots of these kinds short movies; Tales From the Darkside, Tales from the Crypt, Twilight Zone, etcetera. However, this movies is only a horror film in the nominal sense, and shows not an ounce of creativity. The stories are badly written, hard to follow, and just poorly made all around from the acting to the directing and everything in between. Really, words fail me how bad this movie really is. This movie is not even bad enough to provide a few chuckles. Seems more like a moneymaking scheme by some schmucks who own the right to the Creepshow name. Thanks a lot for wasting everyone's time with a truly terrible flick."
1,Just plain bad,Worst horror film ever and it does not deserve the Creepshow name. Poor George Romero.
1,shoe in for rasberry award,Creepshow 1 & 2 were great. This horrible mess should never have been made. what a let down ugh... the 1 star reviews are not lying this is god awful worst movie i've seen this year
1,HORROR-BLE!,"I saw this on Starz one night. The WORST i've ever seen! Don't buy it! If you do, bury yourself alive!"
1,Crapshow 3,"Quick Review. If you loved the first 2 Creepshows, all you need to know is that neither Stephen King or George Romero had anything to do with this miserable name rapage called Creepshow 3. Horrible."
3,"Is it good & scary..NO,but is it fun..YES!!","I've read all the terrible reviews,here on Amazon,but I think most were written by people who were expecting another part 2 or 3,serious and scary film.This is neither serious or scary,but it IS fun.The movie,when taken for what it is,and what it was intended to be,at the time it was made,does the job.It is full of dark humor,and will take you away from your real-life trouble and frustrations,for the dvd's running time.There is no Dolby 5.1 sound,but it isn't really needed here,this is a HBO video title,so not a whole lot should be expected.If you want to forget about real problems,and have $1.00 to spend at the redbox,I can't think of a better solution...stories of people,having alot worse time in life than yourself.For me...Guilty Fun!!"
1,Abysmal,"This movie is terrible. Just terrible. There is one funny part in the last story, but that is it. There is nothing scary, suspensful, or clever anywhere to be found. Save your time and money."
1,ONE OF THE WORST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL.,"Creepshow 3 has got to be one of the worst horror movies of all time.A shame that it was ever made.This is an insult to the previous 2 creepshow movies.Please do not waste your time or money with this one.Its not even a horror movie, its not even funny.it's just sad."
1,"If you like dung with your movie, look no further!","This has nothing to do with the previous Creepshow movies. This is something totally inferior. Admittedly, there were some scenes which could've been developed by a competent director and cast but sadly that's not this case here.Only ""rent"" this waste of money if you have to see it. Be wary of those who say this was a great flick. Don't believe them at all.Not recommended to anyone of any age!"
2,Not So Creepy,"They should of quit while they were ahead...Some stories were worth it,but then it gets kind of lame...But since I have one and two I figured why not have the whole collection? Not all bad I guess..Should of been more of a comedy show.."
3,Creepshow 3,"The third installment (if you want to call it that) in the Creepshow 3 is ruined by poor CGI. The end was one of the dumbest scenes in the history of modern horror.Alice, a spoiled kid gets a remote and it changes her family. I missed something on this one actually but in the end she turns to a bunny.The Radio was probably the best story on this dvd. It's probably because it didnt use CGI and the story was simple but effective.Call Girl was a good story with some bad CGI effects.The Professor's Wife made me laugh when they hacked up his wife. I know it sounds cruel and I may have given away the story but it was funny.The last one I dont recall what it was called but it was pretty stupid and should have been cut from the final print. Again, the final scene is one of the worst cases of CGI.Not really a bad film but not as good as the first two. I'd still check it out because it's not as bad as everyone says."
3,Eh...,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I LOVE Creepshow 1. Creepshow 2 is pretty amazing too. I am a huge Tales from the Crypt fan and Tales from the Dark Side. I love cheesy horror films with stupid characters and witty endings. Creepshow 3 was decent, I paid $2 used and it was totally worth it. If I had paid over $10 I would say I got robbed. For the most part, the acting was bad(not cheesy bad but like the actors were trying to act well but sucked) but whatever, I delt with it. The plots were cheesy like I like it. The animation at the beginning was so stupid I almost turned it off before even watching the movie. I say if you're interested in the film, go for it but if you expect another 1 & 2 then you are going to be right back here writing your own bad feedback."
2,Not as good as the others,"This one is not as good the other ones,I wouldn't of bought it if I new what it was like."
1,What a horrible movie!!!,"It should be a crime to name this film Creepshow. It does a terrible injustice to the other two amazing Creepshows. How did these filmmakers/writers think they were on par with the original movie producers? The only reason I finished the movie is because I thought maybe, just maybe, the next story will be better. Boy was I wrong. Each story is terrible, the acting revolting, sound effects are cheesy (think Tom and Jerry cartoons), production value is garbage. Do yourself a favor and destroy every copy of this movie that you come across."
1,"NIGHT OF THE LIVING ""HACKS""!!!","THIS FILM WAS MADE BY THE SAME INFLADED EGO'S THAT BROUGHT US THE UNWATCHABLE HACK FILM, ""DAY OF THE DEAD 2"". THE OVERALL QUALITY WAS OK,AND HAD SOME SCARY AND HUMOROUS MOMENTS,BUT IT'S DEFINATLY AMICHURE HOUR. THESE LOW TALENT FILM MAKERS SHOULD GET THEIR OWN TITLES INSTEAD OF LEECHING OFF THE SUCCESS OF OTHER TALENTED FILM MAKERS. BEHIND THE SCENES MATERIAL SHOWS THE TWO DIRECTORES SITTING BACK AND GLOTING IN FRONT OF THEIR TWO MOVIE POSTERS AND ACTING LIKE BIG SHOTS. THEN ONE OF THE ACTORES CLAIMS THE FILM IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINALS. WHAT A JOKE. THIS FILM WAS OBVIOUSLY A ""NORTH OF THE BORDER PRODUCTION"", IF Y0U KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I HAVE TO QUESTION WEITHER OUR FRIENDS UP NORTH LIVE IN THE SAME REALITY WE DO. MY ADVISE TO ANYONE WANTING TO WATCH THIS FILM IS, DON'T! WATCH CREEP SHOW 1 AND 2 AGAIN AND ENJOY STEPHEN KING AND GEORGE ROMEO FLEX THEIR HORROR AND TALENT MUSCLES."
1,Creepshow ?,Your a serial killer your a vampire now your evil grin. Thats as scary as it gets. What's creepy is that my video store has 3 copies.
1,awful movie,half of the movies didnt even have a real plot.Alice---- ummmm why did the story end that way. didnt even add upthe call girl----reading other sites it tells what the dude was. IF you ask me that didnt even look like one.pass this up. I rented it for a buck and it was a waste of a buck.
5,The perfect lullaby,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this book and song. The music is printed at the end - and it puts her right to sleep nearly every time. She sings the song whenever she is putting her animals to bed, and it is a lovely story! The illustrations are great for this age - I wholly recommend it!"
4,A Perfect Bedtime story book.,"My two year old loves Barnyard Lullaby but can not resist closing her eyes to sleep as I read the last two lines on every-other page: ""Go to sleep, my sweetheart, Tomorrow is a brand-new day"". When we are not reading this story at bedtime, she loves to name the animals and make each one's sound."
5,A thoughtful look at the romance genre.,"This is a great collection of scholarly essays by well-known romance authors about the genre. Any serious romance fan will find this a fascinting read. I was continually impressed by the profound insights in this book. Not only is it a compelling response to the many unenlightened critics of the genre, but it is also a thoughtful consideration of how romance novels reflect the changing face of women's issues in this country. I particularly enjoyed the article by Susan Elizabeth Phillips called ""The Romance and the Empowerment of Women."" Also, Laura Kinsale's article about how readers respond to the point of view of the narrative was fascinating. This should be mandatory reading for all romance editors."
4,If you truly want to know Women fantasies!!,"This is a solid book from best selling authors that will truly help you understand the fantasies of women. Buy this book and read it slowly to let it all sink in, and then model yourself after these fantasies to banter with women, Fun guaranteed on this. This will help you understand their fantasies, and a book such as BANG from Roosh V will help you attract the Women."
4,very good book,"There were a few points discussed in this book that I had never really thought about before and appreciated reading about. For instance, I liked Laura Kinsale's essay ""The Androgynous Reader: Point of View in the Romance"". She argued that the reader of a romance novel doesn't neccessarily identify only with the heroine, but also with the hero, maybe even..."
2,could be better,"I've had this phone/clock for about a year. While I like the compact design, the actual performance left something to be desired. The clock sometimes ""gets stuck"" after the alarm goes off and then the clock time is off by several minutes. I had to double check the time every night before I went to bed to make sure the time was correct. The display is too bright for a night stand, even on the low light setting. The caller id indicator flashes if you don't review the new calls. It is very annoying to have a light flashing when you are tryijng to go to sleep. I had to put tape over it... Last but not least, the alarm sound was not pleasant to wake up to. I bought a new cd/clock radio that I am very happy with and I am going to get simple phone with no flahing lights. I would not recommend this product if you like to sleep in a dark room."
2,GE Model 29292,"There's really only one problem with this phone but it is a big one. When you set the alarm time it is very easy to mess up the current time. Every other time I set up a new alarm time the current time messes up and the alarm ends up going off an hour early or an hour later than I expect it to (this occurs despite the fact that I am aware of the problem and very careful when I set the times). The phone does have 2 alarms and if you are going to set the alarms once and then never adjust them it would be a fine phone. For me, this is not the case and I am in the proceess of finding a replacement for it."
2,Was OK for a while,"While initially happy with this product, after about 18 months, the illuminated display became dim, making it very hard to see at night (which was the point of buying this). The LCD worked OK. Warranty is only for a year, so I'm out of luck. When I find something else with similar capabilities, I'll be buying that and putting this in my growing collection of old phones."
4,Napoleon Mad Libs? Sweet!,"This is definitely for the hard-core Napoleon Dynamite buff (& the Mad Libs buff). You can kind of pretend you're writing script for a remake. Or for deleted scenes. Or just because you can never get enough ND quotes. In any case it's pretty good when it comes to sticking with the ND ""vibe"". Have fun..."
5,This one doesn't contain the plastic (which ALWAYS breaks),"The adjustment screws work very well, too.It's a nice upgrade from the cheaper ones with the plastic shield in the door insert. You could just keep replacing those, over and over again, with the same thing... but replacing with this all-metal version is a job you need do only once."
1,DO NOT BUY,"The vent mount is junk. It contains two plastic flimsy pieces that attach to the vent and could very easily break. It is so big and heavy that I did not even attempt to put my Garmin system in it, because it would have fallen to the floor in seconds. I strongly advise that you consider other options before purchasing this product, because you will be sorry if you waste your money on this. Luckily, I was able to return mine for a refund. Minus the shipping, I wasn't out anything. Now I've purchased the garmin dash mount instead."
3,"This is a 15lb Anchor, not a 16lb as Advertised. Works.","**PLEASE NOTE THIS IS ACTUALLY ONLY 15 POUNDS**Anchor works well. I had a 12 pound mushroom anchor that didn't want to stick in the river bed and keep our 25' pontoon in place. I thought I was getting a 16 pound anchor, but it is clearly stamped as 15lbs. Seems to work well and hold the bottom of the lake much better than the mushroom.Overton's has had this marked incorrectly for months now and has not updated the description. Just make sure you are okay with a 15lb anchor and know that before you purchase.3 stars for incorrect description and spotty return option. I could return it, but would have had to spend much more to go to an 18lb anchor, which was probably more than I needed and didn't feel like I should have to pay for an error that has apparently been listed incorrectly for a while now. Overton's is local to me and I buy through them frequently, but find them hit or miss on quality and product descriptions."
3,16 lb anchor,The anchor was not what I expected and I had a minor issue with the coating on the anchor. So I contacted customer service about the issue and they took care of it better then I could have ever imagined. Great service I will keep shopping.Thanks Tom D.
1,Horrible Experience,I had to wait over a month for this item first a cheaper item is recieved they thought they could give me a cheaper tripod but no i noticed and another thing is that i had to send it back it pissed me off i will never do business with this comapny again
4,An overlooked funk soul classic,"Although Charles and Eddie seem to be relegated to the '1 Hit Wonder' status, their debut album is very good and if you enjoy 1970's riffs, wonderful singing and excellent melodies, you should buy this album. Definitely a great 'urban' album and effortlessly blends funk, soul and pop music. Still wonderful after 14 years. Their talents are missed!!"
5,Unbelievable Audio R&B Experience,This CD took me on an incredible journey of R&B sounds reminiscent of Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield. It is like enjoying a fine aged wine that leaves you feeling warm and wonderful inside and wanting the feeling to last forever. Thanks to Duophonic for preserving this sound by embracing it with their very souls. If you love the Gaye/Mayfield sound you will love this CD.
3,Don't Judge A CD By It's Cover!,"What do you get when you take 18 old tunes from the 50's 60' and 70' and place them in a racy jacket? 18 old tunes! There is absolutely nothing new here so don't be fooled by the cover. On the other hand, if you want to hear some original tunes that have been covered many, many times, for example Peppermint Harris' ""Bad, Bad Whiskey"", then you may want to add this to your collection. For those that are interested in a sampler of old blues, there is quite a line up here including J.B. Lenoir, Sonny Boy Williamson, Lightnin' Hopkins, Memphis Minnie and Big Joe Turner to name a few. However, the song selection and quality of the recordings are mediocre at best. Two stars for song selection, one star for sound quality."
2,A dry story,"I bought this book because I was interested to read a story set in modern Shanghai. In this respect I was not disappointed. The Red Thread does provide some interesting and evocative descriptions of the city and its surrounds. However, as a love story it is impossible. The main characters are wooden and superficially developed; in fact, some of the minor characters are more interesting. The technique of telling the story in parallell with the story of the old manuscript might have worked, had the old story been more intriguing, and the new one alive with believable passion. As it is, it is as dry as the paper of the old manuscript."
3,A Very Hard Love Story to Follow...,"When I began reading ""The Red Thread,"" I was very interested in the plot twists and history of the story itself. However, as the book continues, I found myself struggling to keep interest. The past lives/loves of our two main characters is fascinating, and especially the ""soul mate"" quality of the ancient book linking their reincarnation... but the author, unfortunately, does not keep this excitement. Plus, the introduction of a third character that seems ""thrown in"" to make a better story, just doesn't seem to fit with the majestic theme. I kept reading the story for the simple fact that I thought it would get better, in a sense-make a full circle, and I never came to a conclusion. Perhaps that is the point, however, to come to that realization is a step far beyond what the author projected."
5,Beautiful sandals,I was very happy when I recieved these fab sandals. I have in multi color. Very comfortable and stylish.
2,"Great Wood, Bad Manufacturing","It took me 2 hours to build the most simple thing- why? Because the holes were drilled on the wrong side of the bottom part of the headboard. I had to borrow my neighbors drill to avoid sending the whole thing back to the manufacturer. After drilling the holes, the headboard pieces almost fit right but it was good enough to build. The bed is sturdy and great. Should only take 30 minutes to build, make sure the holes are drilled on the backside of the bottom headboard crossbar, not on the same side as where the mid-bar goes into. Other than that, great bed."
3,Solid frame lousy slats and head frame parts,"The frame was sturdy and lasted at least 5 years. But the slats where not fitted correctly. And the space provided for the slats to sit was not wide enough. I had to add extra wood on the inside, and to add additional screws to stabilize slats and the wood framing in headboard."
3,"The United Nations, Jimmy Carter, and CNN. ?????","Dr. Hamburg, during a TV interview on 10/8/02 thought a good place to begin changing the world on a path toward peace would be through -- The United Nations, Pres. Jimmy Carter & CNN cable news -- Here we go again. We'll just put all the intellectuals together, few of whom have earned dollars in the free competitive market, and have little working knowledge of how the human world functions outdoors of a classroom or library or gov. office, and we'll have them write a book on how to solve the worlds problems. They do this by thinking while their heads are way out of the classroom, and way up in the clouds. Turn everything over to the do nothing UN to get us into deaper trouble - to Jimmy Carter to, well-- - and to Jane Fonda's husband. I quit. P.S. I DO RATE THIS BOOK THREE STARS. I found I just had to pick my way carfully through it."
1,Not Origional Carlo Corinto Silver,I purchased 2 of these bottles for my husband. He opened the one and we discovered it is NOT origional. Now we paid over $50.00 and it states we can't return the items either. This is NOT origional. I would like a guarantee from Amazon stating this is origional and authentic. How frustrating.
1,"not very carefully proofread, if SearchInside is any indication","In the second sentence of the book appears the phrase ""a fourth kind of photo-receptor cell, called roads [sic]""Hmmm...I wonder how much time I'd spend bogged down in typographical errors if I actually shelled out money for this book.(The text does go on to use the correct term ""rods"" in the next paragraph.)"
3,Clearly a first edition,"An overall ""okay"" book for starters, but the content is very ""elusive"".Needs a stronger mathematical backbone. Computer Vision and Image Processing rely very strongly on mathematics, which this almost refuses to present, referring to publications - not what you expect in a text book, but of course a good resource for people interested in image processing!"
1,Do Not Buy This!,"I just got this in the mail yesterday, 8/14/2012 as it had been on hold. I was practicing Shido Kan Shorin Ryu under Sensei Iha and thought this would be a great aid. Surprise! The video quality was that of an amateur using a camcorder. The titles did not even fully show on the screen. Several pictures of Miyahira sensei were cut off at the top of his head. The ""interview"" was a video with no sound, except a narrator reading a dang TRANSCRIPT of an interview!! Garbage! The kata demonstrated was blurry and had several jet noises in the background. Do not waste your money!!"
2,Disappinted,"After watching a few of the 'Legends' DVD's, I have come to the conclusion that the makers are only in it for the money. On this one the pictures were chopped off at the top and bottom, the kata demonstrator were not centered and the heads and legs were cut off in some cases. I also thought Miyahira sensei would have performed more."
1,falling apart,"The rockers look beautiful, but one arrived with a cracked arm, the second rocker is cracking on the bottom rockers and the paint is chipping off the bottom rockers also, a real disappointment."
1,Big dissapointment,"Cheap look, cheap quality paper. Thankfully it was for my own bathroom, so house guests don't get to see it!"
4,Better Than I Remember,"From George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, the couple who wrote ""How Will I Know"" and ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)"" for Whitney Houston (and other hits for artists like Bette Midler), comes an album of well-above-average songs released in 1988 that have actually held up well over time.The highlight of this album (minus the hit ""Waiting For A Star To Fall"") is a song called ""Is Anybody Out There In Love"". I've always been puzzled how this track was never released as a single by RCA Records. It was at the time of this album's release (and still is) a perfect pop song thanks to excellent production by Arif Mardin. I'm confident this song could have been massive given the opportunity at radio and MTV.Other highlights of 'Reel Life' are ""Bring Down The Moon"", ""Stormy Love"", ""If You Run"", ""No Apologies"" and ""Restless Dreamer""."
3,It's a Keeper for My Timeline Underground Collection,"It's a keeper alright. Waiting for the Star to Fall Record is so great. The composer is a real genius. Only one great song, but great for my collection. Go Staples bookshelf!!!!You sure saved my books, dvds, and cds. They're all arranged for a special tuning of my heart second to MANNING of course.Adios,Camore LucasDon't forget to rumble in the Colts RCA Dome for 2007 okay"
2,Short Life,"I purchased these for my car 2-3 months ago, we have not had much rain during that time and my car is only driven about 80 miles a week. They already need to be replaced. I will not be buying these again."
2,ABBA AGNETHA AND FRIEDA,Another retread of songs capitolizing on the ABBA name. Nothing onthis one is memorable.
3,Ironic,"Unlike some previous reviewers I think Rebecca Goldstein does an admirable job showing us a glimpse of the inner world of probably the finest logician that ever lived. She does so in an entertaining style, and the way she describes the odd friendship between Gödel and Einstein is very touching in a `novelish' kind of way.Ironically, she fails rather dismally in explaining the theorems Gödel is most famous for. Worse still, her account contains a number of errors. Several of those are undoubtedly typos, but this is not the kind of sloppiness I would expect in a book like this.That this has largely gone unnoticed by most of the reviewers around here probably says more about (some of) her readers than about Mrs. Goldstein.I would have given the author more stars if the book's main theme hadn't been Gödel's incompleteness theorems (hence the title ""Incompleteness"", in a series called ""Great Discoveries""). Maybe one had better await the second edition."
2,Overly dramatic writing,"The writing of the book is extremely slow moving. The author writes the same thing multiple times using different words, using almost romantic language. For the first few pages I appreciated the author's efforts to target a broad audience, but it became unbearable after a while and I just had to stop reading the book."
1,"Bad history, bad maths","Pretentious and sloppy, filled with mistakes and repetitions. See the AMS review on-line for some details. Terrible. And shame on S. Pinker and B. Greene for their glowing cover reviews. Were they swayed by the adoring references to them in the text?"
1,Unsatisfactory,"Goldstein really needs an editor. This is a book for a noble cause...popularizing important ideas in difficult areas of human thought. However, Goldstein does not have what it takes to maintain a coherent narrative over 200-odd pages. The book is fragmented and, worse, Goldstein comes across as a woman trying to impress.I powered through the book in search of references and bits of concentrated useful information (which exists). The experience, however, was distinctly unpleasant."
3,More history/biography than philosophy/math,"The book itself was quite easy to read, however I was disappointed with the brevity of the section covering Godel's actual proof and its philosophical implications (the proof isn't detailed until half-way through the book, and is discussed quickly).Essentially, the book boils down to a retelling of Godel's life along with an overview of associated philosophical and mathematical events during that period. Enjoyable to read through, but perhaps more ""observational"" than some will be looking for."
2,Not very good,"In its account of logical matters, and matters pertaining to the history of logic, the book is sadly deficient. The psychologizing about Gödel and Einstein, and the generally romantic approach of the book, is something that a reader may or may not appreciate."
1,Story heavily obscured by author's style,"The author, Rebecca Goldstein, appears to be one of those authors who feels it necessary to use obscure words, phrasing, and technical language to impress her readers. Although I am a well-read professional person, I found it necessary to refer to my dictionary far more than I ever have before, to the point that it was difficult to maintain a smooth flow of understanding. I was struck not only by the topical tangents used to fill space, but by the incredible overuse of fabricated terminology, much of it based on the prefix ""meta-"".Unfortunately the book's style obscures the story of Godel and his theorems. Perhaps time will heal my wounds and I'll be able to find a more coherent, lucid treatment of this mathematical icon's work."
1,As Boring As It Gets,"This book doesn't get any more boring. Its pointless, difficult to follow, and too historical. Rather than accounting the actual discoveries, theorems, and mathematics of Kurt Godel, this book goes into great detail about the philisophical and historical aspects surrounding the genius and his times, as well as his contemporaries. Nonetheless, it is extremely dry."
3,interesting review on American Scientist Online,"While I have not read the book myself, I have found a very interesting review on American Scientist Online. The reviewer's main point of critique is of conceptual nature when he writes: 'She even misunderstands what the incompleteness theorems state, because she writes (on page 191) that ""For Gödel, for each formal system there will be truths expressible in that system that will not be provable."" But this is false, because there are infinitely many different formal systems in which every truth expressible in the system is provable.'"
1,little light on the subject,I was dissapointed that the book was a soap opera covering of Godel's life. The book delt with Godel's and others ego trips and people preferences not the subject of his life. There was no light on the subject of the incompleteness theory or its impact. This book is a waste of time and money.
2,"Less than accurate, incomplete to say the least","Goldstein is a good writer, and her novels are recommended. She is also a philosopher. However, bringing her novelistic talents to bear on on this arcane topic does not lead to an accurate portrayal of Godel's motivations. Likewise the philosophical implications of these famous theorems are not nearly as well-established as the ""good story"" implies. For the review of the book in the London Times by a working expert in mathematical logic, history, and philosophy, see Solomon Feferman's review. All of the talk about the limits of rationality might be beside the point, as other reviewers have pointed out.Feferman concludes his review with these words: ""Those who are fascinated by Gödel's theorems--and the general idea of limits to what we can know--may still hunger for a more universal view of their possible significance. But they should not be satisfied with Goldstein's `vast and messy' goulash, hers is not a recipe for true understanding."""
2,Both technically and philosophically confused.,"As a student of logic and the philosophy of mathematics I found this book seriously confusing. The book contains a number of technical, biographical and philosophical errors. Interested students should try and get hold of reviews of ""Incompleteness"" by Sol Feferman and Juilette Kennedy, logicians who explain the book's flaws better than I could."
5,"At the core of all our logical attempts, lies, ironically, a paradox...","This is a beautiful book.Beautiful as in mind-tickling, deep, complex, articulate, with a very nice artistic touch.Given the mind-numbing complexity of the topic - Gödel's theorems AND Gödel's own interpretation of his results - which is at odds with most other interpretations - the book does a great job explaining both of them to the layman. With diligence, Mrs. Goldstein builds a solid case for her views. A case that sticks. A case that's original. A case that is thought-provoking.In the end, that thought doesn't want to go away.Not easily. Not this time.Someone said somewhere that beauty is not a question of aesthetics. That beauty is a question of truth.I meant my remark that hers is a beautiful book in the regular and the extended sense.Rewarding read."
4,Gentle introduction to Godel,"This book sets out to understand the incompleteness theorem through Godel's nature and intellectual relationships. In doing so, we get some excellent philosophical insights situating Godel's theorem with Einstein's relativity theory, Hilbert's formalism, Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and Turing's decidability theorems. The proof itself takes one chapter midway through the book. It's a general self-contained introduction that just gives a concise overview. The last chapter is pretty light and concerns the times of Godel in Princeton. Overall, this book is quite a tour de force to tie up all the loose ends to understand this very important theorem."
5,I SO love My Girl,"I really love My Girl.The first one was SO sad.But I still like it better then the second one.At the begining of the film,you would think Vada and Nick are NO match.But you can tell,Nick and Vada begin to enjoy being around each other.I noticed,Nick kind of developes a little... crush on Vada.....?I really love this movie.But I really wish there was a My Girl 3.DON'T MISS THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good 'Coming of Age' Movie.,"I have to say, I have loved every Anna Chlumsky film ever made. So maybe I'm partial to giving her movies good reviews, but who didn't love her in ""My Girl?"". I know probably the first of the two is mostly everyones favorite.. However, the 2nd one was my personal favorite.We get to watch Vada growing up..well already grown-up somewhat. We watch her go off to California in search of finding out everything about her mother for a school report on ""Someone you've never met"". She finds out some good, some bad-- she discovers achievements & disappointments. But her biggest discovery is herself. She finds out who she is, where she came from, accepts a new sibling, and meets a boy along the way. This is a great film not only for teens but for anyone of any age. So get lost, and rediscover yourself in ""My Girl 2""."
5,BETTER THAN THE FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!,My Girl 2 is much better than the first one. The first one was too SAD! This one is REALLY GOOD!!! I loved it! YOU GOTTA SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
3,My Girl 2 is ok but there was no point in making it though.,This is a pretty good movie but whatever his name was Austin whatever was trying way to hard to be the tough guy in the movie. And it was so obvious that he was just there to replace Macualay Culkin. It would have been really nice if at the of My Girl 1 Vada and Thomas had gotten together. Because I personally think that Vada and Thomas were sort of the right ones for each other. It depends on how you look at it. I also know that deep down inside Thomas had a little soft spot for Vada you could tell by the way he was acting around her. Vada and Thomas 4ever.
4,Daughter likes it,"Keeps my little girl entertained, she loves the songs and as usual Clifford offers a good message about friendship and caring."
4,Not enough Rock'n'Roll,I only have one small problem with this package of videos. I was really hoping for more Rock and Roll episodes and was really disappointed that there was only one.
3,One problem,"I had one problem with this package of videos. One of the videos was titled ""Clifford's Rock and Roll"". I am the type of parent who does not want my children exposed to rock and roll. I was just looking for good wholesome videos that taught little, cute lessons. Most of the clifford episodes are great! I was just dissapointed to have one of the Dvd's all about rock and roll because one DVD has 8 episodes on it! and that was just such a waste. - Jesus Christ is the King and is returning soon!"
1,Very poor quality DVD,Wonderful movie directed by R. Rossellini. A master piece starring Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders. The quality of this copy is very bad. Also there is NO MOTION MENU to select a scene and NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES for people who have hearing loss.
5,good value,It is a good performing product for this price. Aiwa is always the best in price/quality. Never a problem with it
4,Another Great Night on the Delaware River,"Ok, you may have read that I narrowly gave the previous night the edge as the better of the two Philadelphia/Camden nights. But let me highlight why this show is also a must-buy bootleg: 1) A rockin' version of State of Love and Trust...enough said. 2) A hilarious and touching Vedder moment as he appears alone on stage after an encore to acoustically attempt Soon Forget. Sure, he messes up (twice!)...but that's what makes these live CDs so unique: they're so unpredictable! Buy this one along with the night before and enjoy two consecutive shows of varied setlists."
5,Mind Prey,Received quickly. In perfect condition. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Thank you so much!! Cost was very reasonable.
3,My first Prey novel fails to impress,"I finally decided to give John Sanford's Prey novels a try. I don't know if Mind Prey is an exception or if this is typical of the other Prey novels, but I wasn't impressed. The writing was so-so and the story was lacking in suspense compared with other novels in the genre. I found the villain to be stereotypically evil, the characters lacking depth, and the plot following a color-by-numbers formula."
3,Substandard prey,"Not up to the standard of most of the other Prey novels; new characters weren't as interesting and the pace of the action was slower. Sanford didn't seem as engaged in the plot as he normally is. But, what the hell, its still a Prey novel, the top of this particular breed."
5,LUCAS DAVENPORT BOOK SEVEN,"John Sandford offers up book seven in the PREY series, MIND PREY. His detective hero, Lucas Davenport is one of the best characters in the genre. I think this book is the best so far. (I encourage you to read them in order.) Davenport is a great detective and he is rich, that is very different too for a cop. He is a computer games creator, he drives a Porsche to work. This novel once again brings Davenport against a skilled madman gamer. A great story with great support characters. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,mind prey,"again, it went to my 5 yr old grandson, instead of me, so I bought it elsewhere. the book is great."
4,John Sandford's Mind Prey,I thoroughly enjoy all of Sandford's creations in the Lucas Davenport PREY series. Attemping to solve the case along with Lucas as the characters react in the stories as they unfold is a great challenge. Many twists and turns as one tries to guess and second guess what has happened and what may be about to happen keeps the reader in suspense. I heartily recommend Sandford's books.
5,Home Run,"Standford has hit another homerun! Davenport is back and stronger than ever. The way he tricked John with the cell phone was a classic! I also loved how Davenport beat John at the end of the book. It was really hard to put down, and I lost a lot of sleep b/c I didn't want to go to sleep. I highly, highly suggest this book. You won't be sorry. You can take that to the bank!"
3,QUESTION,I received these jeans and they were much smaller than this size usually is for me.......I could not tell if I could exchange these jeans and there was no tag in the box to allow me to return them.....How do I proceed - I would have liked to have had this information - Patricia Dunn
5,Great book I couldn't put it down,"Listen all you Metallica fans out there you got to get this book. It will tell you everything from when it started in Ron's garage all the way to the infamous self titled ""BLACK ALBUM"". I will admit some parts are booring but overall this book rocks"
2,WEAK,"The writer made no attempt to hide the fact that he never ever talked with Metallica people. The book is entirely based on quotes from the band's member on rock magazines, fanzines and MTV interviews. He did a good job linking this interviews, nothing more than that. He also made a ridiculous short introduction to rock scenario at the time of Metallica's beginning. The overall result is a weird kind biography, even knowing that is unauthorized. He has a good writing style, no doubt about that. But all the facts are well known (of ourse, theyu were taken from magazines! )"
2,THERE IS NO GREAT DEPTH HERE !,"I'm a huge Metallica fan, so I bought this book hoping to read a great unauthorized biography. But all you'll get are parts of interviews conceded by the band to MTV or magazines around the world! THe iniative to write the book was honest, but the result totally disappointing."
1,SECOND-HAND INFORMATION,"All you've got in this book is second-hand information, taken from magazines. The writer has a good writing style, it is a good reading, his job was good-intentioned, but the result was very generic, no great insights into Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett and Newsted. Only for fans beginning to know Metallica and who wants to know the very basic stuff."
2,DISAPPOINTING ....,"Nothing new here. The writer linked a lot of inteviwes into a coehrent time framework, nothing more than that. THe members of the badn were not interviewed."
1,Terrible. Just terrible.,I don't wish to spout rhetoric about me being a huge fan of the band or something equally similar but I bought this on the proviso it would be an entertaining read despite knowing just about everything published on the band already.I was three pages in before I bailed. Poorly written and Crocker's use of switching word spellings to coincide with Metallica songs was nauseating to say the least. The layout is especially hideous (who thought two black vertical borders was a good idea?). The following day I returned it.If you want a good book about Metallica look no further than Joel McIver's 'Justice For All: The Truth About Metallica'. Funnily enough one of the metontour videos showed a confused Lars signing a copy for a fan.I would have given it a 1/2 star if amazon.com would let me.
2,Rockport - Not Waterproof,"I own a pair of Men's Rockport Waterproof Moc-toe Chukkas Dark Brown, they are so not waterproof...Rockport proved to be useless against rain. My feet got wet after I took a walk down the street in the rain, and I thought they are supposed to be ""waterproof?"" I am very disappointed. Maybe they should be labeled ""water repellent"" instead of ""waterproof""!!!!"
5,It's okay to be different,"This story has been a hit with my nephews for some years.It is an endearing tale of a lion who prefers to hug, rather than hunt, the animals in the jungle. The illustrations are delightful, and the verse rolls off the tongue.Though the story may not be true to what really happens in the wild, to focus on that is to miss the point.The beauty of the story is in its simple, rare message:- That it's okay to be different.- That when you give love freely, it comes back to you.A must have for you and the kids."
5,Adorible,I bought is book for my Goddaughter's father to read to her. The book itself if very cute and the artwork is nice as well.
2,Not one of Giles Andreae's best,"I am a big fan of Giles' books. We have most of them! Our favorites.. Giraffes Can't Dance and Rumble in the Jungle. But this one did not meet our expectations. First of all, the mother sends Leo away! What mother would ever send her child away? It doesn't make sense. Also, I don't like all of the references to death. And ""biting through the skin"" of the zebra. It's definitely not good for young children."
1,Horrible product,I bought this product for my mother as a present. She took hundreds of pictures and now cannot download them or access them. What a disappointment! Do not buy this product. I have tried to contact the company in vain. I called their phone number. It has been disconnected. I emailed them countless times. No reply. Now I can't even find the company when doing a simple google search. Buy this product at your own peril. I cannot recommend it.
1,"dont buy from this company, you wont be able to get a hold of them","i received this product on time, but i ordered a 2GB card and its only holding a little less then 1 GB on it. i tried calling the company and emailing, but i never heard back. DONT BUY FROM THEM!!! just pay the extra 5$ for a reputable company! I usually never write bad reviews, but this one frustrated me!"
1,Customer & Tech service NON EXIISTANT!!!,"I purchased this SD card because it was ""recommended"" on the amazon web site for the Kodak digital picture frame. However, the card doesn't work in the frame, or my computer. It may only need to be formatted, or it may not be compatible....I wouldn't know though, because after 3 phone calls and an email to the customer and tech service ""answering machine"" and email account in the past week I have had no response!It is really poor when you buy a new product and can't get in touch with the company for suppport. The card comes with absolutely no instructions or reccomendations"
5,Does the job at a cheaper price,"I needed a cheap sd card with free super saver shipping and this one matched. I used the card with my new kodak camera. I've never heard of this brand before, but works with no issues. Remember to format it before use."
3,Char-Griller 1224 Smokin Pro,"I like this grill because it is the size I needed. I recommend buying it but you need to know that it cooks very fast and there seems to be no real way to slow the cooking down, when you burn coals in the large belly, due to several holes that could not be closed. May be better to only burn coals in the small belly. Also it is a pain to put it together, it tends to be a bit wobbly."
1,Don't buy this item. The finish will burn off after 2 uses!,Don't buy this item. The finish will burn off after 2 uses! and when you contact char-griller they will tell you that your warranty will not cover their shoddy product! in the day and age i would think they would be more concerned with keeping customers.
2,Char Griller Smoker BBQ,This was not what I expected at ALL> It separates the fire form under the meat area so you don't get that BBQ flavoring from th ebunrt edges.
4,smoker grill,The grill was a gift for my son. All the hardware was enclosed and the assembly was easy. Thhe grill works well but will need reenforced where fire box mounts to grill otherwise good deal from start to finish.
4,Great Smoker,"Great smoker, I'm enjoing it very much. I did put a better temp. guage at a lower level just off the grill grate to the left of center, and extended the smoke stack lower in the grill with some tubing .It can now hold a 220 temp forever.Very easy to put together.I'm just smoking some ribs and chicken so far and they came great. I use real lump wood charcoal and some wood chunks. You can't beat this grill , great price.I give it a 4 star rating"
5,The best smoker in my opinion,"This has been one of the best smokers that I have ever had/used. It took a little while to assemble, but it is not that tough to assemble. The only thing I would suggest as a big improvement for this smoker is to have better and larger wheels to move the smoker around. It would not add that much cost to this smoker, but it would be well worth it. I'm going to try and up grade mine to larger wheels on my own.Rick"
4,First time smoker,"First time smoker here. I've read up on all the techniques and even bought a smoker's cookbook. Assembly was pretty simple. I didn't attach the front holder because I didn't think I'd need it. I tried it out this past weekend and I must admit that I'm hooked. This thing handled a large pork shoulder and 2 large racks of pork spareribs with plenty of room to spare.The only problem I had was keeping the temperature past 200 degrees for an extended period of time. I was using lump charcoal exclusively in the side fire box. I don't know if that was the problem or not. I ended up having to finish the shoulder in the oven for a couple of hours but it was well worth the wait. Next time, I guess I'll just keep heaping the charcoal on throughout the day."
2,Disappointed in Amazon,"While I'm sure the actual product performs just fine, the product that I received in the mail was a used product that had been poorly packaged and arrived in damaged condition. Despite the claim that Amazon placed on the site that it was NEW, the body of the smoker had food grease staining the inside and, when assembled, the top of the body was dented so nothing fit together properly (which is one of the most important things to have in a smoker!) There was also a huge and deep scratch on the front of the side fire box.The most disappointing thing about the entire process is that when I called Amazon to complain, the only thing they could give me was a 15% discount. The box that the smoker came in was barely holding together as it was, and so it would be almost impossible to ship it back in the same box. Very frustrating."
2,Disappointed,When the product arrived the box was badly damaged and so was the grill. The lid did not align properly and we had to bang it with a hammer in several places to get it close. The Char-Griller symbol was missing for the lid. The paint cracked off the top of the smoker attachment the first time we used it. Definetly looked like someone had returned this grill and they didn't inspect the product before shipping it out.
1,Not for me,"I replaced a large Weber grill and now I'm going back. I prefer indirect cooking. This may be fine for direct.With the attached firebox, the grill consumes an immense amount of fuel. Buy your wood by the cord. The heat is very uneven, much hotter near the firebox than away from it. You have to move meat several times to cook evenly. I did try the fire bricks but this only helped marginally.The grill itself is rusting badly and I live in the desert where most metal does not rust. The grill leaks a lot of air, and I suspect that is why you need so much fuel to maintain a reasonable temperature. I bought on the basis of the reviews here, and I really do not understand the generally positive feelings about this grill!"
2,Not bad if it's your first smoker,"If you are just getting into smoking, then this one is not too bad if you don't want to spend big bucks for a more professional unit up front.Problems I'v had:1. On mine the grates would drop into the grill fire box until I took a couple of screw clamps and a couple of two by fours and forced the fire box to be retangular. Shouldn't have to do this. Char-Griller needs to make the lip that the grates sit on wider, and improve their manufacturing.2. There is too much of a gap between the lid and the grill fire box, leading to a lot of smoke and temperature loss. Once again, the manufacturing needs improvement. Again, I can fix this by adding more thickness, but I should'nt have to.3. The wire handles that lift the grate up and down are poorly made, and the little supports they sit on are too short. More than once the grate has fallen to the bottom of the grill fire box. I guess I'll have to add longer supports."
3,Great griller for indirect but inefficient for low and slow.,"It is a cheap offset which means you are going to use alot more fuel to achieve the same results you could achieve in a better engineered rig such as a WSM. I have had a Chargriller Smokin Pro for about 7 years. It is a great unit to grill or indirect cook on and I like the fact that it has such a large cook area.I also like the adjustable grates for doing steaks or roasts. But.... For low and slow, You have to babysit this thing too much. Once you try a WSM or a similar outfit, you will use your Chargriller for grilling only as the name implies.Very inefficient for long cooks."
1,Product packaging is insufficient... cannot get one undamaged,"truthfully cannot rate product becuase I have never been able to receive product undamage. As a result I have never had a chance to assemble and cook. Packaging is insufficient for weight of product so every order I have made (a few) it always ends up damaged during shipping process. Then it just becomes another job to send back, get new one, send back..... I am ready to cook, not manage returns... I would not order until they develope a solution to shipping issue because I think there is very small likelyhood of receiving undamaged (UPS delivery guys agress). Too bad because I had high hopes for this unit. My mother found a smaller version at a local store and I have enjoyed cooking with it. My guess is that this company makes good products and hope to some day try out the BBQ with a side fire box."
1,Very poor quality and it RUSTS,"We received this as a gift and already it is starting to RUST out in the bottom. It grills ok but don't count on having this grill for long due to the rust issue. It is a lot of money to put into a grill to have this happen. Luckily we didn't pay for it. Also the ""all weather"" cover is terrible and has come part, shredding."
4,SLV1 Reviewed,"Easy installation, I was happy that I could quickly put the unit together, and find a place in the vehicle for placement. I like the fact that it also came with enough pieces that I had several options during the installation process to choose from; whether it be vent mount, or dash location. I recommend this kit to anyone looking to purchase a similar unit."
2,Car Kit Only Works When Car is Warm,"Strange one. I purchased my Stiletto and Car Kit from Circuit City. I had them install it. They direct wired the Car Kit to my 2002 Subraru. After I got the car home - a three hour drive, the next day the Car Kit would not power on. Then in the afternoon it would power up. Then in the morning would not power up. It had a mind of its own. It seems that the kit only powers up when the interior of the car is warm? Not a good thing for Colorado.I called Sirius to no avail. - Take it back to Circuit City thay said. I ask them if I could have them ship me a cig lighter adaptor - no - have to buy a new car kit to get that.Called Circut City - The problem is they of course have to see it. I wanted to see if I could resolve this issue w/o driving back up to Denver just for that. No Luck - The best advise I got from both Circuit City and Sirius was to buy another Car Kit and have some one local install it."
4,docking kit for cars,Very handy product if you purchase a stilleto 100 if you don't have a stiletto 10 or 100 this would be next to useless. no really works well and comes well equiped with accesories .
4,stiletto 100,This product works fine I don't know if it was worth all the money. It wasn't as cracked up as i thought it would be.
2,Do not buy unless you will connect it though the audio output,"I recently purchased the car kit (as the Stiletto does not have an FM transmitter). The FM transmitter works, but not well. The signal it emits is not strong at all, and as a result, you can barely hear Siruis from my car stereo (irrespective of what channel you select). The problem is not acquiring the signal from the satellite to the Stiletto (that is very good); the problem is the car kit emitting the single to the car stereo. I assume, but have not yet tried, that connecting the car kit via the audio output will solve this problem, but if you intend to use the car kit without an audio output line, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. It will result in nothing more than frustration."
4,sirius stiletto car kit,"The kit is easy to install and use, however the extended FM transmitter is very very weak so I had to purchase another additional FM transmitter so that I can get a clear signal.This should be standard with the kit."
2,Need FM direct adapter,"Yes it does allow you to listen to your stilleto in your vehicle, however, you still need to purchase the FM direct adapter separately. The FM transmitter it comes with is useless. They need to repackage it so it comes with the direct adapter."
1,"If you drive something smaller than a minivan, don't bother.","I am generally unsatisfied with the Sirius Stiletto, but especially with the car kit. I drive a Buick Century, a good, solid mid-sized car, and the car adapter is so big and bulky that I can't use it. In a Buick Century. We are not talking about a tiny Nissan or Kia. We are talikng about a Buick! The adhesive for the dashboard mount is too weak to support the weight of the unit with the radio. I LOVE Sirius radio, I may eventually pay to have the internal satellite antenna put into my car. But the Stiletto is a disappointment."
3,Poor FM transmission.,This unit works fine if you are direct connecting to your car sound system. If you are relying on the FM transmitter you will be disappointed. The signal is weak even with the antennae extender. It is impossible to find a frequency that doesn't have static.
1,Bad connection,"I purchased the Stilleto 2 and the vehicle docking kit thru Amazon. I hooked up the docking kit in my truck without any problems, but when I went to put the radio in the docking unit, it didn't fit. Seems that the connectors don't line up. I called Sirius and they said I had to contact where I bought it (Amazon). It fit without the battery and backing, but didn't line up when it was completely together, so I ground down some of the case to get things to line up. It now works properly, but when you spend this amount of money for a product it should work properly and Sirius should handle problems with their products. I'll never buy from them again."
1,Horrible Quality,I purchased this item and once I attempted to use it the quality was horrible. It was very staticy and you had a hard time listening to your music over the static. I ended up returning the item and buying a much cheaper one from Wal-Mart that works much better. I wouldn't recomend waisting the time and money on this product.
2,"Works well, but connections are not durable","I was able to get about a year out of this dock.You have to use the antenna connection adapter, or a direct connection. The FM modulator sound is awful.After a year the connection at the base of the dock, where the antenna goes it, has become useless.Trust me, it was not abused, and saw very little stress on the cable beyond normal use.If I want to use this setup, I now would have to purchase another dock....hmmmmmmIsn't that convenient.Many positive reviews because it is a cool setup. But do not plan on the product lasting."
3,Stiletto,"My main concern was the fm transmitter as on other reviews it stated it was not very strong. I bought this unit for my father to use in his tractors and cotton picker of all places and I needed it to work thru the fm transmitter. Well, as adversited, it did not work very well in the tractor or combine. Now, in all fairness the radios in those are not state of the art by no means. He also uses this unit in his Chevy truck and I helped him set it up in ther also and he has been very very pleased. Never would have thought my dad would have become addicted to satellite radio...but he has. Overall, I was pleased with this unit and the price."
4,Sirius Stiletto 100 Vehicle kit,Essential package that will allow you to adopt Sirius Steletto 100 to your vehicle. This kit came complete with all necessary parts. It is easy to complete the installation. Must be patient and understand your car electrical wiring.
3,Prima's Quake Game Secrets,The book was OK for the beginner but don't get it if you have the full version. The book is woefully short on picture (they are non existent) but overall it is an OK book to get the novice Quake player started.
5,A Much Needed Analysis of a Shameful Period,"There's nothing I can add to embellish the two very fine reviews on this page. I would like to emphasize that Willan has done his homework. The book is replete with notes carefully culled from an astounding array of sources, many of them interviews Willan conducted with people involved in ""the years of lead."" Most importantly, Willan maintains a tone throughout the book that bespeaks of a even temperament. Conspiracy theory fans will be disappointed. The reader comes away seeing the huge gulf between secret policies (with their collusions) and grand-guignol plots (like the claim that Bush/Cheney orchestrated 9-11).The strategy of tension in Italy was one of the most shameful periods in recent Western history, mostly because the Italian Communist Party had long before and transparently abandoned any aim for revolutionary change. Willan's thorough book will make thoughtful readers hope such is in the past, never to recur."
