5,use it all the time,"i use this to hook up my computer to my television for netflix, itunes, etc and it delivers great quality for images and sounds"
1,Works for some cables and computers,"Got two of these and they took forever to get here. When i tried them, I could only get these to work with some of the hdmi cables and only my older computer. The laptop I bought it for won't even work with these. I think I am going to just throw these away."
3,"If it works, it works well.","I originally purchased one of these many months ago. That original adapter worked first try and still works today exactly how it should. Recently, I decided to buy another, and I couldn't get that one to work for the life of me. The merchant promptly sent me a replacement with no hassle, but unfortunately, the replacement also seems to not work. The ones purchased recently appear to be of a different type of build (the style is different), so I wonder if something about them was changed. In any case, if it works, it works well, so if you're up that, go for it."
1,Would not work for me neither.,"I have 2 outputs on my pc video card:HDMIDVII used this adapter to go from DVI to HDMI. When I hooked it up I got no signal...nothing at all. In fact my monitor would not even register that I had anything hooked up. I was also using aBlueRigger High Speed HDMI cable with Ethernet (15 Feet) - Supports 3D and Audio Return [Latest Version] with the adapter.So I purchased25 ft PTC Premium GOLD Series HDMI to DVI Cable - 24AWG, supports 1080pand it works fine.I replaced a functioning HDMI connection with the same HDMI cord and worked...so I know it was not the HDMI cord.I have no idea why this adapter would not work...but it didn't."
2,Not good,"It arrived at a timely matter, but the picture on my monitor was very purple and I think it was defective"
4,Oops,"I bought this hoping to hook my 2004 Dell computer to my new plasma tv. It's not as simple as just getting a $2 adapter, there's more to connecting analog to digital than just this item. I tried and failed. But that's on me, not the performance of this adapter. I shouldn't even give it a rating since I have yet to use it for what it's intended. DO YOUR RESEARCH."
5,Fine for hdmi out of PC to screen with a dvi input,"Works fine. I have a laptop with a hdmi output. I have an extra screen I wasn't using with a dvi input but no hdmi input. Who really wants to use 15 pin vga cable? I don't really like them. Plus they fall off easily if there's no screw-in option.Why didn't I just buy a cable with hdmi and one end and dvi at he other end (both male)? I'll tell you. Cause this item is cheap and I bought a 6 ft hdmi cable to go along with it (both male ends, and very cheap). The future is hdmi for everything. That 6 ft cable will get all kinds of use for many years. The hybrid (hdmi to dvi) cable will be useless in 3 years.It doesn't carry sound. That's NOT a problem. DVI doesn't carry sound."
2,Don't Expect Too Much,"I bought a Geforce 1080p card to attach to my 24-inch AOC 1080p HDTV to use it as a monitor / TV.The AOC has a computer monitor input, but since the Geforce has both types (SVGA and DVI), I thought I would buy this cheap adaptor and use an HDMI cable, and would obviously(?) get superior results.Wrong!The DVI video quality is noticably inferior to the standard PC connection. It seemed like 720p zoomed to 1080p (fuzzy).Since the AOC only has one HDMI input, I can use that for my blue-ray player, so no great loss. It was just disappointing to learn that this newer DVI interface did not perform as well as the old standby."
3,Captive of the Harem by Anne Herries (Large Print Historical Romance),"Description from the book back cover:She belongs to him ... Sold to Suleiman Bakhar after being taken prisoner on the high seas, Eleanor Nash is fearful of what will become of her. The all-powerful Suleiman will not allow her to leave Constantinople, while Eleanor is adamant that she will not willingly become his concubine. To Eleanor's surprise, Suleiman's open to Western ways. The glimpses of the sensitive man behind the awesome public image tease and tantalise her - and his seduction is increasingly hard to resist.Ottoman Empire ... capture, treachery and passion ..."
4,After such a long wait,"Great Album overall. I think that the song ""I Won't Turn Back"" was worth the Four Stars alone. Mark Hubbard has an inate ability to always come out with one or two songs in the album that absolutely jam. Such a welcome change of pace from the praise and worship format dominating gospel music today. I was afraid that Mark Hubbard was turning towards that genre. Album squelched any fear of that happening!"
2,Clustering Overview,"This book provides background information on system administration, clustering, and distributed computing. Only 3 or 4 of the 11 chapters are directly related to clusters and distributed computing networks. The majority of the book covers system administration tasks that are relevant in any setting. The clustering chapters do not provide adequate detail to evaluate the options available.As an introduction to system administration the book is acceptable, but the overview of clustering is too cursory to justify the title. The book is also poorly copy-edited, with some of the acronymns expanded (sometimes amusingly) incorrectly."
3,Helpful & easy to follow but lacks detailed explanation,"Overall this book is nicely structured, easy to follow and builds very nice intuitive knowledge of clusters.I feel that at some places contents are not detailed, for example chapter 4 on alternative file system, chapter 8 on parallel computing, and chapter 9 programming a parallel cluster leaves me little confused."
3,Not quite an encyclopedia,"Provides a very broad overview of campaigns and a decent amount of pictures, but no way is this an ""encyclopedia"" of ""uniforms."" That being said, it is a decent value. You could buy 5-6 other lesser cost books (such as Osprey) and end up with the same amount of media."
3,"Nice all-in-one-coverage, but far from complete","The book simply does not live up to the hype on its cover. It is not comprehensive or in depth but more of a broad overview of uniforms and history of the period. While many of the illustrations are good and cover topics not often seen, others are skipped over. There is no color illustration of a basic French or Austrian Infantryman, only examples of the exceptions to the standard uniform, but there aer two identical illustrations of Grenadiers of the Guard.Overall I was disappointed but for the price it is a good overview if you do not need in depth coverage of any of the particular topics."
4,Great value - great uniforms !,"Much like the American War Of Independence companion volume this is not a true ""Encyclopedia"". It is a well illustrated excellent introduction to the period and will provide a lot of inspiration for history enthusiasts and wargamers alike.The drawings are numerous and well done - not re-hashes. It is not exhaustive - if you want details on every regiments facing colors - this is not the book. Yet there is plenty of text, plenty of information and frankly for the price it is a TREMENDOUS bargain.I think some are misled by the title of the book - this is not meant to be the one-stop reference for die-hard Napoleonic uniform enthusiasts - but IS a colorful, fun and excellent introductory overview to the period - and a fun quick reference even for the die-hards.For the price a steal - just know what you are getting !"
2,Too obscure,"I bought this book with high hopes, then returned it the day after I received it. The pictures are gorgeous, but just how many obscure uniforms do I really need to see? I expected to see the basic line and light infantry uniforms as well as various cavalry uniforms. Officers and musicians. Go from there. Instead I get sappers and drum majors and gendarmes and everything BUT what I really need. So no help at all. Maybe Smith felt the basic stuff is covered elsewhere by many other authors, so he should extend the range."
4,An Illustrated Encyclopedia: Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars,I waited over a year for this book. It was worth the wait! Digby Smith has done another superb job of providing valid and fresh information to the Napoleonic student.I proudly placed this book next to my others on Napoleonic Uniforms.
4,A handsome illustrated book,"I'm not a napoleonic history buff, but I like read about military history and uniformology. This book gives the reader a good if brief overview of Napoleonica , but is above all a book on Napoleonic uniforms, pictured in hundreds of nice artworks all around the volume. If you like Osprey books you ' ll love this large , colourful book. A great gift not for the Napoleonic scholar, but for all the military history and uniformology buffs."
3,spy thriller with a classical music twist,"The fast and witty but far fetched plot is blessed with an outrageously talented and beautiful heroine who doubles as an internationally acclaimed concert violinist. The backstage look at the life of the international concert star has the ring of truth. The author is a noted concert pianist and her husband is a recording engineer (though not as handsome as the fictional one). While not on the level of the heroes of John Le Carre, this heroine is a nice change from the Jack Ryans of the genre."
4,"Provides a lot, but does not go far enough","Although the idea of providing resources is a good one, many of them are out of date (addresses and contact information,etc.)I have used Project before and I am working on a fast track project and trying to learn the new features at the same time. Some of the explanations do not go far enough, but if you are new to MS Project, this is a good beginning.Some of Microsoft's definitions of project management terms are misleading and in some cases, wrong. The publications on project management that are listed are more correct."
2,"Book is fine, CD is a pain","I found the text worthwhile, but the CD that comes with the book was missing an installation file, which forced me to have to install all of the programs manually. When I called IDG technical support, they said that the only fix was to go ahead and install everything manually, and there was no way to get the additional required file. I would have found it easier to put up with this nonsense if the price of the book weren't so high."
1,Too hard for a leg rest,The wedge is too hard and too sharp when used to elevate the legs to relieve back pain...that would be square side to body rather than the wedge side. I'm sure the wedge works great for raising the head though.
5,Best Yet,This wedge has been the relief I needed. Very well made shipping very fast. Looks and holds it shape. You wont be dissapointed.
1,Poor Product,"First, it stinks like sewer as it comes out of the bag. It took a few weeks to lose it's offensive smell, which of course with your face right above it is quite strong. Second these wedges almost always have cotton blend covers which give you some grip so you don't just slide off the wedge. This has a pure synthetic cover, NOT COTTON/POLY LIKE THE DESCRIPTION STATES. This cover is slippery like nylon material. You cannot lay on it without your upper body sliding down against your lower body compressing you into a fetal position. Very uncomfortable.If you are going to sleep with your upper body on this, don't buy it. Find one with a cotton cover and that doesn't smell like a septic tank."
1,Wasn't happen with product and company wouldn't return,As soon as I opened the box i realized this wasn't what i wanted. A few days later in wrote the company to do a return and was told I couldn't because it was not hygienic. I never used the pillow. Very frustrating.
1,Terrible smell,"The bed wedge had a terrible chemical smell to it. The smell was so strong that it permeated my sheets, clothes, and anything that came in contact with it. I had to send it back for a refund."
2,luv & hugs,"The way the wedge is made is ok, but a deeper one would probably be better,the 7"" is awkward and I could't sleep on it.But I had to raise my bed 6"" also,so it is, here I come to the bottom of my bed with the wedge. Sorry!"
4,12 INCH BED WEDGE,IT COMES WITH A COVER AND ITS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR A MASSAGE TABLE.I GET LYMPHEDEMA MASSAGES REGULARLY. THERAPIST NEEDS TO HAVE MYUPPER TORSO ON AN INCLINE. THIS HAS WORKED PERFECTLY FOR ME.
3,To high for me,"I have trouble sleeping with this pillow,I slide down it during the night.But it's great for watching tv,or reading."
2,hard and uncomfortable,"I bought this pillow for my husband, hoping that it might make reading in bed a bit more comfortable. Unfortunately this pillow is hard as a rock; it's made from cheap foam. Would not recommend."
2,Too hard/stiff,I simply could not sleep with this wedge. It is way too hard/stiff and I kept sliding down. The only good use I have for this wedge is to put my legs up on it.
5,Worth the Money,Item received on time in good shape. It was the real product I expected. Worth the money. I would receommend this product and the vendor who would like to purchase in the future.
3,good but not perfect,"I have ordered this a while ago since I have sinus pressure. Sleeping on this wedge has helped my sinus problem a lot. I put my normal pillow on top of it since it is hard and uncomfortable by itself. My only complain is that it should be longer so that one can have enough back support and in general I think it is not designed ergonomically. Also, by the end of the night I am down the slope! ...I do not know if there can be any solution to that though."
3,Good wedge.,"The wedge was a little too high for my taste. It would be perfect if it was 7 inches tall. However, my husband loves his. It really helps with his snoring and back pain."
2,Bed Wedge,Was hoping that prior reviews on this product were not true. Unfortunately the smell from this wedge is so strong that I was unable to use it after the first night.
2,The cover is horrible / cheap,The cover is extremely thin/cheap and tears very easy. The 10 inch wedge does not have a decently priced cover replacement and covers this size are not common.I do not recommend this product. for $10 more you can get a better quality wedge from somewhere else.
2,Too short. I'm 5'9,"Looking at the pic I thought this item would be perfect for me. After sleeping with it it's just too small. If I position it where it should be my head hangs over the edge. I just wish it was made longer. I am average height, which is why I thought I would not have an issue with this product. I guess if you are 4' this is the product for you."
4,"It works fine under the mattress, but a little hard on top","I first used one of these on top of my mattress, and I agree with other reviewers that it is very firm. I have a firm mattress, but the wedge was too hard for even me. So I bought a second one and put them between my mattress and box spring at the head of the bed, laying side-by-side so they span the width of the bed. This arrangement works much better since I am now cushioned by my own mattress and I can no longer roll off the single wedge. The cover on the wedge seems well made, but that doesn't really matter when it's under the mattress."
3,reasonable product,"I've bought this product a few weeks ago for my GERD problem. It's pretty firm and supports your head well. The only issue I've experienced is that my body would slide down after a while. This maybe due to the 7"" heigt and the length ratio. Otherwise it worked fine."
2,Item reviewed for practical use,"The shape of the item is fine; but it is too hard and after using it for a few weeks it still won't accommodate the shape of the head. I will keep on using it, but I wish it was softer on the head."
2,not ergonomic,"I bought this after using the 12-inch wedge, which is uncomfortable to sleep on. Both the 7-inch and 12-inch do work for acid reflux, though the 7-inch doesn't work as well because you will tend to slide, making the elevation insuffient. In addition, they are not ergonomically designed. The main problem is the lack of lumbar support. The human spine is not perfectly straight. You need to put a rolled towel under your lower back to feel comfortable, otherwise you'll find yourself sliding down toward the bottom of the wedge in the morning. Prepare to get lower backaches. Also, this is not designed for side sleepers. I'm going to try stacking something under the head of the bed instead."
5,great quality,"I bought two pillows for some people with medical needs. My daughter has one, and it has helped reduce the incidence of gastric reflux and also helps reduce the severity of her mild obstructive sleep apnea. The pillow case is good quality, and I would definitely recommend this for comfort or medical reasons."
5,Not for purists.,"If you are looking for a book about the Appalachian Trail itself, there are much better books out there. However, if you want a book about the hiking experience and the people one meets out on the trail, this is the book for you. Like many of the hikers I met on the AT, Winters is propelled onto the trail by loss (e.g., the death of her father, a love relationship that went way wrong), and the consequent desire to locate home. (Hence, the title.) I have not read a more observant, telling, articulate narrative of long distance hiking. Purists might sniff at her rainbow blazing habits and the fact that she didn't finish the trail, but few will dismiss this book as insignificant. It is, in fact, a gem."
2,Pilgrimage Story Only,"If you want to inspire you in your thoughts about hiking the Appalachian Trail, this is not the book for you. Kelly Winters whines about rain and pain on the trail and that is about all. It is a pilgrimage story, so if that is what you are looking for, you might enjoy it. But if you want a story about the trail try reading ""A Walk for Sunshine"" by Jeff Alt for a fun and inspiring tale of life on the trail."
5,Not What You Think,This is not your typical travel log. Like the title says This is about her pilgrimage and journey. She let a lot of her herself show but there was still a since of mystery about her. This was a great book.
5,Real Adventure,"What an interesting book! I loved it. It was great to hear an inside story about thruhiking and the people that do it. If you like outdoor adventure type books, this is a good one. Makes me want to thruhike one day."
1,More lesbianism than trail,"I read 35 pages and was totally turned off by the author's graphic descriptions of her boyfriend's sexual perversions. I knew right from the start she was trying to justify being a lesbian and her issues with sexual orientation. Even the first nite on the trail she talks about someone offering her condoms and saying she wouldn't ever need those. I skipped to the last few pages and sure enough, she ends up with a woman. Since I was too disgusted at the beginning to even read thru it, I felt like the author was just setting the reader up for her personal quest into homosexuality, not really about the trail itself. I had no interest to find out. I have read some other good books on the trail and wasn't about to waste my time on her journey of sexual exploration. I didn't need to read further to know this wasn't a book for me."
5,A really awesome book!!!!!!!!!!!,"Rachel is pretty lucky! She has that amazing talent to spend money! She gets into some pretty awkward places in this book, and has some trouble with her croc(NOT GATOR!!!)morph. I really enjoyed the humor in this book. KA Applegate is a wonderful author. If you enjoyed the other books in this series, you should love this one!P.S. does anybody else think that the cover illustrations are a little wrong? Don't they have to wear skin-tight clothes to morph?"
1,it was good.,"Frankly i think it was a good book but the TV seirs said that cassi got sick when it was realy rachel,Come on peple this is rediculus.and from all the shows that i have seen the first show one was nothing lick the first book! And quit frankly i am growing out of anamorphs becase their comeing out to slow. But all in all The sickness wasn't all that bad."
4,a little bit boring yet it had good fighting scenes,I mostly just liked when Rachel was put in dangerous and awkward positions I also liked when she stepped on and killed a yeerk
4,Not in line with the rest of Animorphs,I felt that this was slightly disapointing. I had heard that it was really good and found that I didn't fit in with the other Animorphs. I am reading no.13 and that is AWSOME though.See ya'
5,AH AH AH-CHOOOOOOOOO!,Rachel has an allergic reaction to the newest morph that she has. It's one thing when your house collapses it's another thing when the Yeerks are about to take over! Jeremy Jason McCoy is the cutest thing on Earth for a ton of girls and he is now a Yeerk! When Rachel is National T.V. will she reveal the Animorphs?
2,Very hard to get drink through top,Cute cups but tops are completely disfunctional. Drink doesn't flow through the top. You have to create a REALLY hard suction to get any drips out. My 2 1/2 year old couldn't drink from them at all. He uses them without the tops.
2,Cant figure out how to operate,"Sounds strange but I find that there isn't much coming out of the nozzle of this bottle. My son finds it difficult to use so I don't use, they are pretty though. I thought about enlarging the opening with a knife..."
2,Cute but tough to sip,"I bought these for my daughter as she transitioned to whole milk. She seemed to have trouble with these cups, so I finally tried to sip out of it myself- I even had trouble getting water out! I do not use them."
3,Leaks,"The Good:-No separate valve to wash.The Not-so-good:-Leaks a lot if left tipped over or dropped-Hard to get the liquid out (requires a lot of sucking power)I like that it does not have a separate valve to wash like other cups, but if this cup tips over it creates a large puddle. I have a friend whose toddler cannot make these cups work - he can't get the liquid to come out (I've tried them and it does require a lot of sucking power). So if you decide to go with them, maybe find someone who has them and test it first."
2,Spills,I have yet to find a sippie cup that does not spill. This one spills from the point of where the cap twists to the cup. It is just annoying.
4,Great cups,"I have tried many ""leak-proof""sippy cups over the last ten years. I think ones that have no extra parts inside work the best. These would be one of the good ones. Not sure how long they last before they will leak, I will have to add that later, but after a couple months, they are still leakproof."
4,My favorite Sippy Cup,My kids like the sippy cups mainly because of the characters on em. But they don't leak maybe a drop or two if on side. The only complaint i have is the picture gets worn off after a while.
5,Good quality,"These are good sippy cups to have. All of my daughter's other sippy cups have an attachment in the lid that makes it dificult to clean by hand and the Disney line doesn't, making it easy to clean by hand when you don't have time to wait for the dishwasher."
5,"Best cups we've tried, safety to boot",We've tried many. LOVE that there are no valves to clean or get knocked off. Insulation keeps them cooler longer. Our kids (ages 1 and 2) have no trouble sucking through them. One big benefit not mentioned: they are not made with polycarbonate plastics (new info. 8/07 from the NIH indicate they believe that bottles and sippy cups made from polycarbonate plastics can cause long term neurological and behavioral problems). These cups are made from BPA-free plastics so 1 less worry.
1,Also Received the Wrong Cups--and TWICE,"I also ordered the cups pictured but received the wrong item. A much lighter weight, see through cup from the Learning Curve, not the First Years. I called to complain and was sent the same cups! I am exasperated and do not know what Amazon is doing right now but the trust I have with them is declining!"
1,Worst sippy cup,"I bought these for my 15 month old daughter after we transitioned her from bottle to sippy cup. She got so frustrated trying to get the milk or water out that she just gave up and cried. I tried myself to get some water out of it, and it's really hard to get anything out. Giving them to good will for sure!"
5,"It is lovely cup, not leak. Very strong","It is lovely cup, not leak. Very strongIt is lovely cup, not leak. Very strongIt is lovely cup, not leak. Very strong"
1,distort in the dishwasher,"These cups are great and they still work despite the fact that they changed shape after washing them in the dishwasher. I made sure to put them on the top rack, but they bubbled out and now won't sit on a flat (or any other) surface. Too bad. My son liked them for the design."
4,Work well but not perfect,They do work well but they can leak from time to time. I think it's from the pressure building up.... They aren't rounded like in the picture.. more boxed.
5,Thomas the Tank,"Another hit with my granddaughter. A can't miss item. Your toddler will love them, especially if he/she is hooked on Thomas!"
4,Best SIppy Cups EVER,I love these sippy cups. They have no plugs in them like other brands which can get lost or worn out or melted in the dishwasher....oops ^.^ These cups are so easy to use. I gave it 4 stars because sometimes the lid needs to be adjusted before it gets on tight...but by sometimes I mean...once in a whole day...if that...Really the best sippy cup I have used in my 7 yrs of being a mom. I stuck to a particular brand with my first 2 but for my last child I found these and wished I had them for my daughter.
2,difficult to sip,"This cup isn't leak at all, that's good.But the tap is too big for baby...At least for my 15 month son.He uses this cup for 2 week, and every time he spill milkfrom the edge of his mouth.It's annoying!"
1,Impossible to drink from,My one year old could not get any water out of the sippy. I tried it myself and only a few droplets come out when trying to suck the water out. We had to toss these!
5,READ BEFORE BUYING IF U DON'T WANT THESE 2 LEAK ON U!!!,"I have owned these for over a year now, LOVE THEM!! They WILL NOT leak if you have water in them only. When you put some soda in there they WILL leak. The bubbles from the soda make it leaky. Juice I don't think leak but I'm not sure as we seriously put only 1/8 juice in there and the rest all water as we don't want our kids to have that stuff. I know the soda leaks though because it does everytime we've given him any and we also only use 1/8 soda and the rest water. Luckly for us this is not an issue at all as we are HUGE water drinkers and very rarely have anything else and when we do he drinks it fast enough that we still don't have to worry much about the leaks. So just consider what you put in this cup before buying, they are the best and the water comes out nicely not like some where ur sucking on it and can't get anything out."
1,"Leak,Leak,Leak",My son is 19 months and has always drank from a straw sippy cup. He just never liked the regular spout sippies. Well now when we are at play group he always tries to take the other kids sippy cups and drink from them. So I wanted to get him his own. We ordered these and they are horrible. They leak like crazy from the first use. plus the mouth valve is super wide so it is really big for my sons mouth. Thirdly I had a hard time getting liquid out. It is very hard for a toddle to suck the drink from. I purchased son playtex ones and they are great. No leaks and small spout.
1,plastic covering on holes impossible to remove,I have worked on the film covering the holes for over an hour and have so far been unable to remove it.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These are by far the worst sippy cups I have ever purchased. We bought them since my daughter is in love with Minnie and thought that they would hold up as well as Playtex sippy cups. The first time we filled them, they leaked like crazy. I thought perhaps I put too much in so I decreased the amount and they still leaked. Forget letting them fall on their side, that's even worse. I can't tell you how many leaks we have had to soak up because of these cups. They are in the trash and I am sticking with Playtex. Don't waste your money - they may be cute but you'll need to buy a whole lot of paper towels to clean up the leaks."
1,not the same item pictured or described!!!!,"This is the second time I've ordered ""The First Years"" cups and gotten a cheap knockoff ""Learning Curve""!!!! They are not the same! The Learning Curve is not as well insulated, the pictures come off easily, and they leak horribly. I returned this set because I kept the first set and was terribly dissapointed. They need to CORRECT THE DESCRIPTION of this item!!!!"
1,Nothing getting through,"Purchased these sippy cups at Walmart for my 9 month old daughter. I gave her juice in the cup, I noticed she wasn't drinking anything. I tried drinking from the cup, nothing would come out of the spout. Don't purchase this product. Took cups back and got my money back in cash."
2,"Great , but the pictures wear off with handwashing","My son was obsessed with toy story so these cups were a must for us!We have had them for 5 months. They do not leak, but the picture have totally worn off! I only handwash since we don't have a dishwasher so I am not sure if they were put in the dishwasher what would happen.Not worth the money."
1,They leak!,They leak! That is the most important quailty a sippy need to have is to be leak proof ( at least for the most part) and these cups are terrible. My son loved the Toy Story design but I would rather have a plain ole sippy that does not leak all over! Don't waste your money.
3,It's ok!,I wouldn't recommend this. Is really hard for my daughter to drink from it.every time I gave her sippy cup she wouldnt finish her milk/water so I try to drink from it n it was really hard to drink from it ....
1,impossible to drink,"I feel like I've tried 10 different types of sippy cups so far, and these ones are the worst! While I appreciate that the sippy cup doesn't spill, it is also impossible to drink from! After seeing my son get frustrated when he tried to drink, my husband and I both tried it. No matter how hard I sucked on it, i could not get out more than a dribble. The only way to get them to work was to cut a hole in it, which then made it not spill proof. Do not buy."
1,Arghhhh Sip Proof --- Aweful Product,I tried the cup before i want to give it to my baby. No way you can get any water out of it. Terrible terrible product!I have bought Born Free... Great! Avent...Not bad.
3,Absolutely loved this sippy until....,This cup was so great at first. It is BPA free. No little pieces to loose. Doesn't leak. And it is really good for smoothies. Other cups have lots of little cracks that strawberry seeds get trapped in. But after a couple of months it cracked and soy milk/smoothie leaked in between the cups walls. So I guess they are great if you don't mind replacing them often.
1,Spill proof and nearly sip proof,"We bought several of these for our 23 month old twin boys. Saw some frustration, but we had also recently given up the bottle. My husband and I both tried these cups and got nothing out of them. We tried loosening the lids, refrigerated, unrefrigerated, milk, water. Each time it was very difficult to get a drink. I'm going back to my tried and true Playtex that we used with two older children. It was nice to see this new-to-us product and not have to mess with valves and making sure they are clean of any residue. We've also tried Nuby soft tip and Nuby hard tip (with a two sided valve) and still lean toward Playtex."
5,Great Price,I bought these to get free shipping on an order and my daughter loves her Mickey cups. I am pleased with them as well that I just ordered another set to again get free shipping.
3,The cups leak,I bought these cups for my daughter and they leaked first use. I still use them but will not be buying them again.
1,I have 11 of these and 6 leak...,"I purchased a total of 11 of these cups over the past 5 months. For the initial use, I did have to push a tooth pick through the slits on the valves. They all worked fine for a while, but have started to leak from the top vent hole (not the spout). I am soooo frustrated! I thought it was the perfect cup and never would have invested that much money in a whole set of them. I can't stand having a million different types of cups. It makes matching them up too difficult. So, I guess I am going to have to switch to another brand. :( i can't handle the leaks."
1,Microsoft works 2003,"I loaded Word 2002 only. It caused the processor to run at 100% all the time that word was active. It would take 30 to 120 seconds to type one character then another or to click on a tool bar item and have it open. All service packs were installed, and didn't cure the problem. When I deleted Works from My computer it caused all WMF files to show up in oriental letters. This program like most Microsoft software it is over priced, buggy and a waste of money. LONG LIVE WORD PERFECT! My computer is running Win. 2000 PRO, service pack 3, 512meg of memory and an AMD 750 Processor. Also jpg. wmf, gif files would no longer work with thumbnail views."
2,Not my favorite coaching book ever,"I've read a great many books on coaching--this is not one of them. Jay's work is simply a rehash of other, better texts. The only thing he's done here is repackage it and does so with more typos than usual. Having seen Jay speak, I often cring when someone proclaims themselves as the ""world's most innovative coach."" To me, that's just marketing husbandry. Jay obviously has taken from the inept Joe Vitale school of self-promotion: If you claim it, fools will believe it. If you're serious about coaching, try James Flaherty's COACHING: EVOKING EXCELLENCE IN OTHERS. There you'll find the focus on the RELATIONSHIP as opposed to trendy and mechanistic tools that you can find for free on an Internet web search."
1,I won't buy it,I can't believe you make me hunt and peck to find the legnth. All done. I'll buy someone elses.
4,Good read for a rainy day,I love Lori Foster's books and quite enjoyed the first 1 or 2 however she is not the best paranormal romanitic writer. The first story makes buying the book worth the price. However since I didn't like the last two I had to give it a 4 out of 5 stars.
4,very good,"this was a good book, it is hard to rate anthologies, but i really liked the first three stories. i would have given this a 5 if the last story had been a little better. it was the longest of the stories, and i felt it kind of dragged a little, or was repetitive. plus zane annoyed me by being so heavy-handed, and tamara let him get away with it. but other than that a very good book, with stories you will love."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"Ok I know that this is a reissue, but you have got to get the book, even if just for the cover. YUMMO!!!I'm sure some of you are familiar with the Winston Brothers, I mean who could forget Cole, Chase, Mack and Zane????These are extraordinary guys coming from a close knit family, not only are they gorgeous but when they love, they do it with no restrains. They will make you fall in love with them and leave you wishing you were the women that snatched them up.It's great to have all the Winstons in one book and with ONE GORGEOUS COVER! Need I say more?It's pure Lori Foster at her best!!! Can't ever go wrong with her books, amazing!"
4,Forgotten Classic,"Sixty Second Assassin is a forgotten shapes film.The films stars Man Lee Pang,Leung Kar Yan,Lung Fei, Wong Chi Sang,Kong Ching Ha,Su Chen Ping,Dean Shek.This is one of Leung Kar Yans very good villian performances. he is the employer of Minute Fong(Wan Lee Pang),who is an Assassin that kills his enemies in under 60 seconds.Minute Fong wants to give the killing up to retire and live in a farm.But Leung Kar Yan has got a couple assignments before he can walk away.This Assassin story has been in many movies but what makes this one special is the fights.Good choreography from kicking and punching.Wan Lee Pang is a Taiwanese martial artist,and has only appeared in very few movies.He is also a villian in Kung Fu On Sale.The fight between him and Leung Kar Yan is indeed worth watching.The Videoasia version is an extremely bad fullscreen copy.There is a widescreen version available.Get that version instead."
1,Quite disappointing,"Brubach does little to convince me that fashion is not, in fact, shallow and dismissable. She comes close to an epiphany of meaning in an essay about the French and the social reading of personal appearance, then loses her ground totally in an article about large size fashions, exposing her own biases without self-awareness. I only struggled my way through this because I'd both looked forward to it based on advance press (fished in!) and spent good money on it. I don't think I'll keep it; off to Half-Price Books for Holly."
1,This is a waste.,"I suffer from profound PTSD. In the hopes of getting off the cocktail of drugs I was on, I turned to this book, and a psychologist trained and highly reccomended.For me, it was a waste of time and money. I strongly urge people suffering to avoid this pap at all costs, This stuff did not work for me, and was a waste of time that could have been used in better therapy.I still have PTSD, and its getting worse. Please, people, don't repeat my mistake, this book and the theory behind it...is pure psyco-babble.It is as though the book's sole purpose is to sell books, and hope,without delivering on the latter."
3,"Caution clinicians, not a manual!","Please note that this appears to generally be a review of some case histories in which EMDR was helpful. I was hoping to learn some techniques for practical application. It stresses in the disclaimer in the book that it is not a manual and no one should try to apply the techniques without first completing the training package, available at significant expense at the institute. In fact, it stated that attempting to apply them without first going through the training may be dangerous or harmful. If you are looking for only background information on the intervention or are already trained this may be an appropriate resource."
4,Very useful and well written,"Very useful and understandable, practical tool and method. It is welcomed as an assett to the counseling profession"
5,Watch Out,"As a trauma survivor, this book can stir up a lot of material. But, that may be a good thing in the long run. The author makes a case of how superior EMDR is as a form or therapy, so do not get sucked in to the belief that one is in-and-out in four sessions with a cure for life. FOr trauma survivors, EMDR can take years."
5,The Cadillac of irons,"This is the best iron, light, doesn't drip all over the place and heats up quickly for those fast touch ups. Water resivoir is a tank that you remove to fill. You can use the iron without the tank to make pockets and sleeves easier. I am very happy with it."
3,Good,"The books does an excellent job of introducing the subject of the duology, as well as doing a good job of keeping things withinn the context of the period the stories are supposed to take place. While somewhat boring in soem places, the confrontations between Kirk and his Romulan ""guest"" as well as Picard's with his Cardassian ""guests"" are great, and the actions taken by both captains are quite within character. If only there were more than two books in the series, it would have been interesting to see something more."
2,Unimportant,"This was a frustrating read for me, containing good writing, but unimportant and meaningless plot that got nowhere.Compesating the plotlessness there was the fact that Ro has always been one of my favorite characters and she has a prominent role in the second part of the book, wich pretty much saves the day.Also, I was gratefull for the information regarding the existance of the novellas on the star trek timeline. Not horrible, but not nearly good either."
2,Badlands.......OK start,"While this first book does bring the four parts of the startrek universe together, it has some problems. Right when the story begins to get interesting you jump a few years and start another. What the author should have done is separate the four stories into four stories. This was very successful for the Invasion Series and would have helped out this series as well.However...the storyline is good, and the way she brings the star trek universe together is worth mentioning.I cant wait to read the second book. To see what this phenomenon really is."
5,simply stunning,"The previous reviewer is absolutely spot on. Solomon is a peerless performer of Brahms. His interpretation is perfect, every phrase articulated matchlessly and with complete precision, and so - to use a hackneyed old cliche that nevertheless says it all - has, for me, made hearing this piece again like hearing it for the first time. I can also recommend the popular Gilels performances, but as I see it Solomon, the Philharmonia and Kubelik (who is brilliant - I will have to hear more of his work) have made the definitive recording here."
3,A whimsical veiw of life's mysteries and the hereafter.,"Mr. Ifkovits somewhat satyrical portrayal of televangelisim is sure to strike a familiar and sympathetic chord with everyone who's ever asked themselves how anyone can have THE TRUTH and still declare that everyone else is headed straight to hell (unless, of course, they repent and send a monetary donation to a certain P.O. Box#). The lead character's revelations from God sit poorly with his father, a nationally known televangelist, and the resulting conflicts threaten to engulf them. Meanwhile his messenger from heaven must defend both himself and his charge to no less a personage than Jesus. A fine mix of humor and tragedy with an unexpected ending."
2,It IS a pot,"But it is kind of flimsy. Im not looking for something which will last forever, but I do like well made stuff. Well made stuff makes cooking more fun. This one doesn't quite make the grade."
5,Anyone who writes in English should read this classic guide.,"Unlike other guides I have read, this book is easy to understand and apply. Other guides impose strict planning and other techniques on the writer. Using numerous examples, Zinsser illustrates the pitfalls common in writing and provides guidelines to clear and precise writing. Practicing what he preaches, the entire book is simple, clear and precise. I would recommend this book to anyone who writes - for school, work or leisure."
5,Non-Fiction Writing,I had to read this book along with Bugeja's Guide to Writing Magazine Nonfiction. Bugeja's book (was bad) but Zinsser is the man. He doesn't make learing hard in his book like a lot of other writers do. He talks to you on a personal level and you can tell that he really enjoys writing a lot and this is why he gives so much knowledge to us the fledgling writer. Go buy this book if your serious about writing it will make you grow as a writer greatly.
2,Good simple writing style for a self-puff piece,"He does teach you to write well, I suppose, and he does have a really noticable style. But how many times do I have to hear how great he was at interviewing, writing, or something else?My prognosis: Well written, but I became a bit bored with this piece of puffery."
2,Cassette not for me,"I committed the unpardonable error of buying the abridged cassette. Not only was the narrative boiled down to less than inadequate bare essentials, the tonal quality of the tape was horrid. Why couldn't the entire book be recorded? Zinsser makes a few great points but I knew I had missed far too much by taking a wretched shortcut Now I will have to purchase the book as well."
1,disgusted reader,"Whomever told this person they could write a novel should be ashamed of themselves. I mean really. Having suffered through the first few pages of this author's other book, I should have known better. This is the last time I trust Amazon reviews to purchase books. I could not read past page 10! That is a new record.My advice is to take up knitting or something. This book was just awful. It will serve well as firewood in the fall."
5,Well Done,"I stumbled onto this book from a friend through a friend of the author. I thought it would be just a guilty pleasure, trying to figure out what all of these sex and the city types were all about, but I came away with much more.Emily Briggs is a well-rounded character. She is great, sometimes not so great. She has quirks and flaws while also maintaining her irresistible qualities. This is what character development is all about and why I finished the book in a weekend."
3,A bit disappointed,"I read this book because of the rave reviews, and I must say, I was a little bit disappointed. I found grammatical errors in every chapter (""2 a.m in the morning"")that were distracting from the book as a whole. It was cute at some parts, but in general I found myself skimming due to lack of interest."
1,A book with too many historical errors to be of any value.,"The Book is a Christian feel good book, that lacks any value as an historical reference. Many myths are retold to cast serious doubt about its veracity.There is no bibliography. The source of the stories are not given for the reader to check its accuracy. Not for the scholarly who would ask for a little more documentation.There is a lot Catholic bashing and a sense of self-righteousness from a Protestant point of view. The book contends that Catholics were not Christians and the ""Church"" or ""Christianity"" didn't begin till the Reformation.To say the least this is a myopic look at the supposed martyrs."
5,"latest Minako album is pop, not classical","Most of Minako's later albums were classical (and she had a fantasic soprano voice!). This latest album, released a year after her untimely passing, is pop music; and the only criticism that I have of it is that it is too short. I particularly liked the third song, ""Flower""; although the title song ""Yasashii Sekai"" is also quite nice).There's a limited edition version of this CD that includes a 5-minute DVD consisting of Minako vocalizing (no words) along with numerous outtake videos over the years. Every true fan will want this version; however note that the DVD is region 2 so you need either a region 2 DVD player or an all-region DVD player to play it (most US DVD players are region 1). I reviewed it on amazon.jp (in Japanese, but what I said is pretty much what I've said here)."
4,Weight set,"This is an overall good set. The instructions for putting it together were pretty vague. The rope pull is a little awkward, but overall a good set for the price."
1,Button deteriorated and crumbled in less than 2 years,"Bought 2 and both buttons crumbled leaving the housing with a light on inside, low grade product. Will be spending more on something that will last."
2,Works great - for a short while,"I like this doorbell except for one major issue. The plastic button breaks after a short while and leaves a hole and the light exposed. You should expect to get less than 2 years of use before it breaks. I've had two of these. I'd gladly pay 2 or 3 times more for a quality doorbell that lasts 10+ years... still looking for one but can't seem to find one (yet).So, minus 3 stars for the breaking plastic button... so 2 stars for this doorbell."
2,A basic replacement doorbell button (that broke),"This inexpensive button was almost exactly the same size as the broken 14 year-old plastic doorbell switch I needed to replace, although the screw holes did not line up exactly.It sits flush on the surface of the door frame, so no other modifications were needed. The light is bright. The metallic silver finish looks a little cheap, but better than plastic. An antiqued finish would likely match more door hardware, but it's hard to complain at this price. Recommended.UPDATE NOV 2012: Downgrading from 4*s to 2*s. The switch broke in the middle (a small hole formed in the center of the plastic button) after less than a year installed. Our doorbell gets rung infrequently (probably 2-5x a week), and that minimal level of usage should not break the switch. Other reviews report similar experiences, so the switch must just be poorly designed or made of cheap materials."
2,Plastic button broke after 7 months.,"I bought this same button somewhere else. It worked well for 7 months, then someone pressed it and the plastic broke and the door bell made a continuous buzzing sound and sometimes rang and not playing with the button could stop it. Finally had to remove it and I'm still looking for a quality button to replace it."
4,Good,"Keep my hair from breaking off so easily. I use a lot of oils to keep my hair from drying out, but this helps my hair from getting too brittle."
3,Still testing,"I like the shampoo it does make my hair feel clean, I still have not seen a change on loosing hair...its been about 3 weeks so I will give it more time. It has a nice smell."
1,Big NO NO,it did not work! I waited a couple of weeks to see results and ....nothing! I have tried everything :(
1,hated it,I would have returned it if i could have it left my hair feeling like a birds nest i had to deep condition it just to comb thru it
5,Poignantly Beautiful Sibelius,"Some conductors prefer to find dramatic excitement in Sibelius' First Symphony but Kletzki and the Philharmonia opt for poignant beauty and the elegance of the long line. The theme is wistful, haunting and also joyful. A great performance and a technically fine recording with an excellent coupling in the Sibelius Third."
2,audio version is an embarrassment,"Shannon Engemann wouldn't be a bad reader if she would take the trouble to look up words she doesn't know how to pronounce. There were so many mispronunciations in this reading it was a constant annoyance. My favorite was ""Nikes"" (as in shoes) as if it rhymed with ""hikes."" Paretsky's work deserves better treatment!"
5,Fine Author,I am a fan of Sara Parestky. she writes well and her plots are complex enough to keep you enthralled and the characters have clear identities that are easy to identify with.
2,Another book with no code,This book like another book that I previously reviewed and have already returned has no significant code samples. It is however filled with descriptions of methods and properties - which I can look up on line.There is no reason to buy this book I am afraid.
1,Avoid this book like the plague!,"Unless they have come out with a new edition that throws out 80% of the original edition, this book is so badly written and has so many egregious errors that it might take you weeks to unlearn all the wrong stuff it teaches you.It was written by many authors, and it shows. A few parts have good content and actually teach worthwhile stuff. But for the most part the chapters either (a) just echo the online documentaion, telling you that you can change the font by applying the font property [doh!], (b) attempt to explain a complex topic in a dozen paragraphs, and so you learn nothing useful, or (c) are just plain flat wrong.I don't have time to go into all the errors I found. The book is so bad that I couldn't even consider donating it to any charitable drive. It's now being used for starting fires in our fireplace. Come to think of it, that might be the best use for it."
3,Nice but..... lack in content,"Ok, it's a nice book. But it lacks in code examples, (i.e., lots of methods and properties, but not codes). It really shows you the new features of the .Net Framework, but sometimes the book is boring... Instead of teaching you what things are used for, it just shows you other informations, in a deep manner, but not the code by itself.Anyways, it's on my reference library, but if you want to learn .Net by other ways, like practicing with codes, I suggest you to look for other books."
2,"Does many things, badly","I'm new to VB, whereas this book intends to explain VB.NET to developers who were familiar with earlier versions of VB. Even though that probably retards my learning, I'm still convinced this book fails. Imagine, nothing but brief code fragments, and no hands-on exercizes, until page 219?? Actually, there are no hands-on exercises even at that point, just source code for some apps on a small CD.Every chapter is skimpy, every chapter leaves something out. This book is too clumsy to help beginners and too incomplete to help competent developers.I learned some VB.NET, and I'm continuing to learn it, but not with this book - with the MSDN documentation on the web. That's not how it should be when you buy a book."
2,"Very sour, and full of powder","I ordered this as well as Metagenics Cal-Apatite chewable calcium (chocolate flavor), and hands down prefer the latter. This product is overly sour (and I like sour/tart tastes in general), so that as you're trying to chew it up your eyebrows raise, your face crunches up and your jaw would hurt if you were to laugh. Also (and this might partially be due to handling during shipping), these wafers are coated in an extreme amount of powder from the broken ones inside. No kidding, if you try to pour a few wafers into your hand, get the vacuum ready. And if you try to reach in with your fingers to grab your dose, your fingers and knuckles will emerge coated in powder and you'll need to wash your hands. I've also learned not to inhale while putting one in my mouth, the powder will get into your throat and gag you! I give it 2 stars because for all I know, once it's down the hatch it's great. But I'm sticking with the other product."
5,The best,"If you travel by road a lot for leisure purposes, this atlas is a must-have. Every state has its own page of top cities and attractions, along with other useful information such as highway info, scenic drives, and campground info. I bought one in 1996 and have been using it ever since; it has been all over the nation with me, from DC to Dallas to Denver. It's survived the test of time, and now I must break down and buy a new one."
1,READ the reviews first!!!!! UNWATCHABLE,"I should have seen these reviews first, I usually do. this DVD is totally unwatchable. Each scene cuts to the next and you trhink something is wrong with the disc or player. Theire is also no apparent time line here, maybe 20 years ago we could have called this non-linearity ""brilliant"" but something is wrong with this disc, as the one reviwer stated, they should have QC'd this DVD before selling it."
1,What happened to the film?,"Word of warning about this DVD - it's not the complete film.It seems to be a collection of action scenes from the film, mixed together in a slapdash fashion, it is certainly NOT the full film.For example during one fight scene there is a dead woman who you have no idea how/why she's there. The movie skips and then in the next scene she's alive and running around while the two who were fighting in the previous scene are now together and fighting a different character altogether.Very disappointing.Maybe the video is the complete film, but avoid this one."
1,What a piece of garbage,"I don't know where the last guy got his DVD from, but I would love a copy since I liked this movie when I saw in on VHS many years ago. I got the same DVD everyone else did, the one that skips from scene to scene, and seems like its scratched or something. I returned this movie 2 times to the store I bought it from because I thought it was defective. Now I see that that is just the way the movie was made. It's a shame really, because it is a decent film. If anyone out there can find this movie released by a different company please contact me, because I would like a copy."
1,I know what's wrong with this DVD,"This will be hard to explain!! I got this dvd and what it does is that in 12 minutes or so into the film the movie will cut to the instant action thing! You see, this DVD played all 1 hour and 50 minutes of the feature film on my dvd player for my computer! But it will do that 12 minutes then skip to instant action thing on regular DVD players or PS2 and I assume XBOX! But still I wouldn't recommend this product! Video Asia is just another piece of garbage DVD kung fu company who are uneducated monogloids who can't pay attention to what they do! I really like this movie despite bad picture but I'd trust bootlegs overthis crap!"
5,"if you like descent, you'll love this","this story takes the ""pulse pounding"" adventure of descent the video game series to the next level. very involving. extends the plot and explores the space opera of descent. you can't put it down until you're done!"
2,THIS BOOK IS GREATLY OVER-RATED,"The book starts out good in the first half but then gets worse and worse. There is too much of constant techno-babble and dogfights that really become boring and irritating. Many things in the plot have nothing to do with the game and are there just to lenghten the story (ex: St. Johns's wife hostage situation etc). Although there is a lot of humor in the book that made me crack up, the rest made me grit my teeth as I struggled to read on. I have come to know every Descent game very well and was greatly disappointed by this book. It could have been a lot better."
1,Returned a Second Time,"I just sent back my 2nd watch box. The first one had a major scratch in the mid-rear lid. The 2nd one had a chip on a box corner, with a poor repair attempt--but the main problem was that the lock mechanism was not aligned; the top and base were out of alignment by about 1/4 inch--no way to engage the lock. Also the key does not seat well into the lock opening. Both boxes were clearly a 2nd time around, i.e. previous returns, as the interior wrapping was torn and the foam parts torn or missing. If you want to spend the $80 for a 2nd hand watch box with potential issues go ahead. I purchased a Mele thru Zappos -- outstanding quality and price. Thanks to the Amazon system, I was able to return easily."
4,Perfect box,"Perfect box for my watches. Useful. Good material quality, nice looking and soft pillows. Very happy with it.You won't regret this purchase.Price a bit high."
3,NOT EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED,this cream is not the same as the beautifying milk. it won't even pour out of the bottle. i have to shake it couple of times before it comes out. Also THE SELLER SENT ME A PRODUCT THAT EXPIRES IN 3 MONTHS. I DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT.
3,Transaction matching not good,"I was a big fan of Money over Quicken. The best thing about Money was downloading your statement from the bank and having the transactions match themselves. You could reconcile your statement in less than 5 to 10 minutes. That was with Money 1999.Unfortunately, current versions of Money have a problem with transaction matching. The logic they use is not as good as previous versions. Now I spend up to a half hour or more manually matching and unmatching mismatched transactions. If you have a previous version of Money you would be better off keeping it.(Microsoft knows about this problem and doesn't seem to have any intention of fixing it. Refer to Microsoft Knowledge Base Article - 317457.)"
3,Fine software except for one thing.,"Overall I'm pleased with my purchase of Money Standard 2003. It's a very useful tool. The account register allows for categorization of all transactions, which produces interesting reports on how all your money was spent and the bills section makes sure you won't forget to pay those many bills on time. However, if you read the fine print on the bottom of the box you'll notice that it says that portfolio quotes downloading functionality and the ability to synchronize your data with MSN Money expire 1 year from first use of Microsoft Money Standard or September 1, 2004, whichever is earliest. Now what is the point of that?! It sounds like part of the software becomes useless after a year. But since I will have gotten it for free after rebates (not counting the time value of money), I suppose I can't complain too much."
3,Needs printed documentation,"Overall, I'm very happy with what I've figured out thus far. I'm sure the program is very powerful, but it really lacks useful documentation. Instructions on what each individual field means are fine, but those don't tell me how or when I should use specific features of the software.NOTE: Before thinking Money enables you to be 100% online, check Microsoft's Money web site to see if your banks and other financial institutions are supported!"
1,Good Program that has one fatal flaw,"Money is an excellent program, as I had switched to it from Quicken. I feel it does a better job in terms of reports, use & feel, and has many more options.However, I recently came across the one major flaw that I had heard previously about. I had to re-format my OS hard drive due to a system crash. I had three Money backups - one on my other hard drive, one on floppy, and one on CD.A year's worth of work is now down the drain because Money will not recognize any of the previous backup files. I had heard of this software glitch from others, but I am here to tell you that it is true.I guess I am going back to Quicken. Even with all of the automated tools, this is a lot of work. I don't trust the backup system anymore and am not looking forward to re-entering all of my data over again. What a shame, because otherwise, this is a nice program."
1,I hate this version!!!,"I have been using Microsoft Money for many years and been pleased. I made the biggest mistake by upgrading to 2003. I had never bounced a check until now. It's register keeping is very confusing. It enters the electronic payments with a date of several days before it is due and it is very hard to tell how much money you actually have in the bank without calling and verifying with the bank. I am seriously considering switching to another software such as Quicken, since I can't go back to the previous version of Money."
2,"Lacking, even much older versions of quicken is better","For morgage accounts, I like to split principle, interest and escrew. In Quicken, I can use the transfer function to redirect part of my payment to my escrew account and keep track of how much money is in it. In MS Money, I can only assign it to a category, but not to a seperate account.It does have better buget planner than Quicken 2000, but I'm deleting MS Mondey and going to Quicken 2003."
1,Save yourself. Buy Quicken.,"I absolutely hate Microsoft Money. I had used an older version of it in the past and found it unreliable and frustrating. The newer versions are just as bad. It is inconsistent with assigning categories to things; you can't reconcile with your online balance; the budgeting tools are very limited; I have a lot of trouble with it adding bills into the budget twice because of problems such as the bill scheduler and the budget planner not quite working together correctly; it's inconsistent with it's ability to recognize two transactions as being similar or not; and, basically, it has made me want to scream way too many times. I'm now going to buy Quicken for the 3rd time. (I have an uncanny ability to lose Quicken disks and then change computers.)"
1,NT users beware,"I have Money 2002 running happily on my NT computer, and when I bought 2003 I didn't even think to check to see if it was compatible with NT (dumb!). It will not install at all, and there is nothing on Microsoft's website to suggest this will ever be changed. I like Money as a product, it got such a bad rating because I can't even use it."
5,Microsoft Money and your Pocket PC,"Microsoft Money is easy to use and if you bank with the right banks will download your statements, saves hours of inputing.As an added bonus on the Microsoft website you can download a free version for your pocket PC. This will synchronise with your desktop version. Makes keeping records less of a chore."
1,The Worst Money Managing Program Ever,"I have spent two days trying to make a simple household budget. There is NO DOCUMENTATION with the CD, and you have to figure it all out yourself. (The Help menu is a joke, forget it.)This is a maddening, complicated and overly difficult program. I bought it because of good reviews, but I wish I had bought Quicken. Stay away!"
3,Erick TakefromthePastis,"One of the major reasons I bought this CD was to check out the collabo's. I was some what disappointed when i heard ""So Sweet"" ftg. Eazy-E. The music is great but i had already heard Eazy's verse from a prior song he recorded on his ""Str8 Off tha Streetz of Mutha Phukkin' Compton"" album. Also Erick's song with Too $hort, ""Fat Gold Chain"", is the same song on Short's 1996 album, called ""Buy you Some."" Anyways ""Focus"" ftg. Quik and Xzibit is really good, ""Why Not"" ftg. Slick Rick is an example of two old school mc's who can still hang today. ""Get da Money"" ftg. Ja Rule is an average song....Basically if you're hardcore Erick Sermon fan, this album will quench your thirst. He sticks to his blueprints of making good beats without to much experimentation. Overall I feel a 'lil jipped cuz of the Eazy track and the Too Short track...but the other collabo's are pretty fresh, equalling a pretty good compilation."
4,Another Great Funk Album,"A great album, lyrics and sound, another classic of Def Squad, in this case Erick Sermon (one of the best producers)"
2,Useless most of the time,This book is a big disappointment. I can never find references to what I am looking for in this book. I wouldn't recommend buying this book at all.
3,Battleships are usefull,"I read this regular book, here in Brazil.This book has many photos, is short and easy to read.Even as an introduction about battleships, this is just a regular book.To example, this book doesn't has almost nothing, about the use of battleships to support of landings.In all important landings of World War II, the battleships were used.About battleships after World War II, this book is weak.About the use of battleships after 1970 decade, there's nothing.Even more than 70 years, after the fact of aircraft-carries becameing the the ""sea kings"", the battleship remains usefull.On first gulf war, in 1991, battleships sent powerfull artillery shells, against Iraq, with small price, no casualties among americans and good results."
4,Pretty Good,"This song is Pretty good. If you have a lady you would like to impress, you might want to mess around with this song."
5,A heartwarming and feel-good story.,Fine Old High Priests will have you crying one minute and laughing the next.Marcus is a story teller and Sam is the kind of friend that only a few of us are ever privileged to have. Their journey through life sharing family trials and triumphs will make you feel as thouugh you have been able to peek inside something warm and personal.
3,Interesting Comparison of World Views,"I enjoyed the book and I recommend the book. His style is very readable. The first chapters are especially good. I never knew how Aristotle was re-introduced into the intellectual community of Western Europe in the middle ages. His description of the faith versus reason (Aristotle's teaching) struggle over the centuries is very interesting. However, the book drags towards the end. The author repeatedly makes the same points in the final chapters. His thesis is that we can learn from Aristotle and from history methods and attitudes that will unite faith and reason in our present day. However, his conclusions are confusing to me.The book as a whole gave me a better understanding of the faith versus reason struggle and how it started long before Galileo's dispute with the Catholic church."
2,A Familiar Overview of The Middle Ages,"This book provides an approachable overview in story-telling narrative form of the re-birth of the quest for reason during the Middle Ages of European history. It offers very little which is not already known by anyone familiar with the period or the history of the Roman Catholic Church and its grip on the intellectual development of the European culture at that time. By all means read it if you want a good overview of this strange time, but keep in mind that it is an overview and at the 30,000 foot level.One complaint I must register here is the choice of title. There is very little here about Aristotle or his writings, or his thought. if you are interested in that seek the ""Cambridge Companion to Aristotle."""
2,"Emotionally charged, overwrought ""history""","The author rushes pell mell into substantial philosophical, theological and historical matters---without any evidence of sustained training in these areas---and makes pronouncements that come across as bizarre or even simply wrong to those familiar with these subjects.It's fun to write in this pulse-pounding, breathless style. But you need to know what you're talking about first!A ""fun read"" but be advised and aware that this isn't really a complete history of the subject."
4,Interesting subject matter,"History is not my strong suit. I bought this and ""Closing of the Western Mind"" at the same time. I found that book to read like a college text book, but this book is very interesting. It is a bit long winded and the subject matter is not my absolute favorite, but it held my interest and told me things I would not have known had I not read it. I foind its perspective intriguing and I sudgest it to others who are interested in the relationship of faith to science. It points out misconceptions we have been given about the development of the two and their relationship to one another."
5,"Aristotle's Children : How Christians, Muslims, and Jews Rediscovered Ancient Wisdom and Illuminated the Middle Ages",delivered quickly and in excellent condition.
3,Good Overview,"Has some good useful information. Nice general overview of safety. Some of it is overkill - like using a swamibelt under your harness. Better to read the ""How to Climb"" series by John Long for more in depth safety instruction. This book is good for a quick refresher for the experienced climber and as a supplement to more in depth instruction and reading for the beginer."
5,Love This Book,"I love this cookbook. My only regret is that I don't use it often enough. The salads, soups, pastas, entrees, vegetables, and everything else is excellent. There's wide variety here as well as subtle touches to basic recipes to make them different. A cookbook worth having and cooking from."
5,Tasty Delights!,"This book not only provides a wonderful collection of unique recipes, but is an inspiration to cook in new and tasteful ways. The pasta and vegetable side dishes are especially amazing. This is by far the best cookbook I've ever ran across. Even if you're not a gardener I highly suggest this book: But be warned, if you're not a gardener, this book might turn you into one."
2,Intricate scholarly work. T.M.I. for me.,This is a scholarly achievement and great if you were doing research. I wasn't. Chose a different book on the Apostles if you want to learn about their lives and how they spread the faith of Christianity.
3,"Okay for beginners, but too simplistic for pros","Students and business people who write their own communications may find the book's recipe style useful for learning how to write a particular document for the first time. However, communications professionals will likely find the material too simplistic for use as a daily reference."
2,dragging and confusing,"I tried to work through the first three chapters and found that not only was it confusing, it was dragging so I couldn't really get into it. A disappointment."
5,SO COOL!,"If your child is crazy about the Cat in the Hat, these hats are just plain cool! My twin grandsons, two, like all things related to the CITH, and their eyes just lit up when they each got one of the paper hats. They carried them around for hours. My daughter wants to use the rest for decor for a CITH-themed birthday party. Love these!!!"
5,A holiday must!! Great seasonal beats from the 80's sound.,"Dont even think about it. Christmas in Hollis is a classic, the Surf MC's are money, the rest is all frosting."
4,Good but look further for practical advice.,"I read this several years ago before my daughter hit middle school. It was spot on as far as description and discussion of various types of social aggression. However, I highly recommend the book Cliques by Charlene Giannetti as a more practical approach to dealing with all the pain, isolation and powerlessness girls feel when they are being vicitimized. It has excellent methods and advice for girls dealing with this trauma, and how to become the power holder instead of the vicitm."
2,Not so great,"I bought this book a few years ago and had to force myself to finish it. It's definitely not as great as it is made out to be. A lot of it is common sense, and Simmons repeats things over and over as the book goes on. There are a few good little anecdotes, but other than that this just isn't worth it."
2,"Not well-written, boring, confusing","I bought this book to use with my Cadette Girl Scout troop to read and discuss for their aMaze journey. Simmons relies mostly on case histories but her storytelling style is weak. The reader can quickly get lost in the web of unrelated characters Simmons presents us and their dull boring lives. Worse, once we labor through these the case histories, Simmons offer little in the way on commentary or insight upon the girls' stories she has collected. It would have been better for her to offer more in the way of a thesis up front. Without one, this book reads like you are going over someone's research notes before they've quite figured out what it is they have to say to the world.I would definitely NOT recommend this title for a book club and regret not having chosen Queen Bees and Wannabes."
2,Definitely hard to read,"I was very interested in reading this book but am dismayed to find my interest waning with each day I attempt to plow through all of the details and interviews. ""I don't think the book was well-written, and did not flow well from beginning to end, just restated the premise again and again with more vignettes."" - I couldn't agree more laschnell (previous reviewer). A well written book can be such a joy to read, but I'm sad to say that I have to force myself to read this one - like forcing myself to have a spoonful of cod liver oil 'cause it's good for me. Not only was the content editing much too sparse, there were quite a few grammatical and spelling errors as well. Tsk Tsk. That said, the subject matter is fascinating and definitely of importance. It certainly brings to mind some of my own childhood experiences, and helps to shed some light on them. My bottom line: I would recommend this book for the subject matter, but caution that it's a slow read."
3,good read among others,"I can definitely connect with this book, and I've read several on this topic. It tells a lot of stories and explains through example. First chapter especially good about the hidden aggression as a culture among girls. I do think that if you're looking for a general book on hidden anger expressed in subtle ways -- with men and women -- and all ages, that ""Overcoming Passive-Aggression"" is another highly recommended book to cut through the mysteries of why people act this way, excluding, dissing, and doing all sorts of other unseemly things when they can't get to the point of what really troubles them, not the victim they pick upon."
5,An absolute must read for parents,"I'm often asked for book recommendations by parents of teens, and this book is tops on my list. I've bought it as a gift, I've sent it to my daughter's school, I've been spreading the word: It simply is a must read. Julia, author of GirlWise: How to Be Confident, Capable, Cool and In Control"
3,Like holding a conversation with a grad student.,"Simmons has a great topic, and I am very interested in learning more about female aggression in youth - however, she usually seems to be just offering up the thoughts that come to her without assembling them into an outline. The book has sections, yet she is constantly putting stories and anecdotes outside of the sections set aside for them. It makes for jilted reading. She doesn't offer any *numbers.* There is no math in this book, no scicentific basis for what she calls ""research.""What I'll say ultimately is that it is worth reading and there are some great take-home points, but the book seems to be co-written by her wounded school-girl side and is lacking in maturity a lot of times."
4,Still Feeling Repercussions,"I had a very visceral response to this book. It took me back to a very painful time of life and a very confusing social dynamic. Sure, not every model of adolescent alienation is represented here - how could they be? But I saw myself in some of these stories. The most disturbing moment came upon realizing how many of these behaviors and coping mechanisms i have kept with me far into adulthood. The author does a great job of putting us as flies on the wall to get a sense of the motivation behind these behaviors and, and of how easy it is in adolescence (and the rest of life) to let the outer world distort your inner self. Conflict, and relationships for that matter, are not easy at any age, but this book really illuminates the emotional struggles of young women, and tries to offer some solutions."
1,The Other Book is Far More Helpful,"Like so many other parents of teenage girls, I'm desperate for any information that will help me help her. While I found this book's descriptions of their world generally fairly accurate, it didn't provide the kind of nuance I'd hoped for or more importantly the practical guidance to help me help. On the other hand, I also read this other book, Queen Bees and Wannabes, which covers some similar terrain but with an emphasis on the practical, and I've already applied some of what I learned in that book to meaningful effect. I'm going to go back and reread Queen Bees and mark it up (and make my husband read it!), and expect it to be of even greater help down the road. So in the end if you're considering these two books, I'd suggest you go with Queen Bees and Wannabes."
4,An excellent start,"I think this book is fabulous for ANY woman. We've all had instances in our lives where we can relate to some or all of these stories. I love the blatantness of this book. The explanations of female behaviors, our fears, are all laid out quite plain. It will help you understand yourself and others, and hopefully give you some insights into how to better deal with other girls and women."
5,How to deal with mean girls,I thought this book was great. I recommend it as a coming of age book. Mothers and daughters should read it together
4,"Girl bullying is real, but is it avoidable?","There are two main starting points here about how young women deal with conflict: (1) It is socially unacceptable for them to act out aggressively, and (2) girls (different from boys) typically fear social isolation above all else. Put these two together and girls will almost certainly trip up trying to navigate the contradictory scenarios they encounter. As long as young women aren't given a proper environment to create healthy friendships, the result will be a near-invisible struggle for power and bullying. Author Rachel Simmons makes her point early in the book and then proceeds through case study after case study which, while intriguing, only slightly adds to her thesis. The book feels overlong because of this.This hidden culture of aggression is real and very damaging though I still think the line between bullying and normal youth socializing is unclear."
4,enzymes,"I bought the book because I wanted to know more about enzymes, where they come from, what happens if we don't have enough and what to do it you need more. The book answered by questions satisfactorily."
5,Wonderful Escape,"Some folks listen to waves crashing on CD. Others pop pills. When I need a brief escape from this wild world, I gnaw on some Twizzlers. Lightly sweet and easy to pack around, Twizzlers are one of the best candies out there. I don't even have to mention that they're a low-fat delicacy, but some healthnuts do need a sugary fix sometimes, and Twizzlers can get the job done without totally throwing off a diet.Highly recommended to anyone who loves life. These little treasures are the perfect little break from reality."
2,Sent it back,Size ran large. Very disappointing. I had wanted it so much. Had to send it back. The two stars are for product quality only.
2,Not going to get powerful profits from this book,"Explains theory behind betting this game, but you will still lose your money if you play blackjack."
4,Very good book on blackjack.,This book is very informative and takes you from beginner to pro. I will also recommend Gregorian Strategy for multiple deck blackjack.
1,God awful!,"I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking, but this is one of the worst Blackjack books I have read. Might as well take your 10 or 15 dollars and just throw it away. This book is almost 100% just random babbling, all words and no numbers. A HUNDRED AND NINETY PAGES INTO THE BOOK, BASIC STRATEGY IS THE ONE AND ONLY THING HE HAS ACTUALLY COVERED. I was disgusted when I looked at the page number and saw 190, realizing all this idiot had done was talk about what he was going to teach for over half of the entire book. He stretches five word sentences into page and a half long explanations to fill up space, and he does it quite well. This book is ridiculously stupid, I STRONGLY suggest reading almost any other book."
2,"Avoid this, go online.","I have found this the most comprehensive printed area guide, with 113 hikes. It has supplied ideas for many new hikes, but it lacks trail elevation profiles, and has some serious flaws.For example, I recently used it to discover and hike at Rockville Hills Regional Park. The map and description were too vague and misleading. When I later checked the online Bay Area Hiker, which describes about 560 trails, I found several warnings and advice about hikes there, that were entirely lacking in Weintraub's book.Next time I will rely on online bahiker, maintained by Jane Huber, who wrote ""60 Hikes WIthin 60 Miles: San Francisco""."
5,Most comprehensive hiking guide to the CA bay area,"Great guide to the bay area. If you want just one book for a hiking guide to the bay area this is the one to buy. Truly up to date and will probably surprise most bay area outdoor enthusiasts with the comprehensive hiking coverage of the area. Even after living here for more than a decade I found new reasons to visit parks that had faded in memory. This guy has truly walked these trails. When you see the accuracy of the trail descriptions, the abundance of information on wildflowers and the choice morsels of local lore you know you are walking with a guide whose heart is in his boots. Another great guide book from this author."
4,"Good Guide, Found some hidden gems with it:)",Picked this up for an extended Northern California hiking and riding trip. I purchased about four others as well and I used all of them as each has a little something different. Not a single one was useless and none warranted less than 4 stars. I would reccomend doing the same rather than just picking one for your trip.
3,Disappointing compared to San Diego version,"I own the San Diego version of this (which is GREAT) and this was a let down. It is shorter, contains less detail, didn't have a bunch of recommended hikes by category. It is still OK but not great."
1,Waste Of Time if you wish to see Monkey Kung Fu,"I thought this movie was going to feature top quality monkey kung fu fight scenes, however that was not the case. In this movie Chen Kuan Tai fights using a style which looks very vaguely like Tai Shing Pek Kwar, however his movie Iron Monkey (1977) is much better if you are looking for genuine Tai Shing Pek Kwar. If you are looking for Monkey Kung Fu don't waste your time with this movie, instead check out Monkey Fist Floating Snake and Iron Monkey (Chen Kuan Tai 1977)"
4,"Fun, spooky mystery","I liked this book when I was in elementary school. It's great for kids who like spooky mysteries. Laura and Bill are visiting their uncle, who is the caretaker of a large hotel in New Hampshire. The hotel is closed for the winter because it is too old and poorly-insulated to heat. The children think that the big, old hotel is fascinating, especially when they begin hearing stories about the ghost of a princess who is said to haunt the hotel and put people under her spell to do her bidding. When the children begin noticing that their uncle is behaving strangely, they start to wonder if he is under the princess's spell. Even though their parents have forbidden them to go inside the old hotel, Laura is determined to investigate the mystery, just like the main character in her favorite series of books."
5,i love it!,this is one of the best volumes i have! i love finding out about how the sacred jewel came about and i love the end. it is sooooo cool. just buy this and find out what i'm talking about!~InuYasha Fan~
5,I dare you to not hate Naraku after this one.,"Sango joins the group in this volume, but not before evil-villain-who-must-die-horribly Naraku messess with her head and tries to make her attack Inu-Yasha. After realizing she's been duped, Sango helps the group learn the secret of the Shikon Jewel/Shikon no Tama, and the group then has their first battle with Sango on the team, as they take on a kid-eating water god, but the ""god,"" is hiding something. A great volume, it is impossible to not feel sorry for poor Sango after Naraku kills everyone from her village. Naraku must die! Also, side note, Kelly Sheridan, who's Ukyo in the Ranma dub, Hitomi in the Escaflowne dub, and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch in X-men Evolution, does Sango's English voice. Her Japanese voice actress is Hoko Kuwashima , who's also the voice of Kasumi in the Dead or Alive games. Well, the group's finally assembled! Can't wait for volume 10!"
5,a riveting whirlpool of a novel,"I've never read a book before that so handily blends literary conventions and ends up trumping all of them--part mystery, part travelogue, part gothic, part pedigreed post-modern novel, the book gently draws you in and then snaps shut around you like a bear trap. The author, Brad Morrow, writes like a dream with a beguiling delicacy and precision that belie how deep and dark is the path he's leading you along. I don't want to get any more explicit about the book and give away the plot. I just want to say that I've never read anything like it, and you'll feel the same way, I'm sure. Giovanni's Gift is that rare thing, a book with literary horsepower and a rocking plot. READ THIS BOOK"
1,"Blather, blather, blather","I appreciate good writing, particularly since it's becoming harder and harder to find. Turning a lyrical phrase effectively in a piece of prose is a skill not every writer can muster. Such is the case here. Aside from the lack of a compelling plot (how long did it take you to figure out our boy was dating a relative? - certainly a lot sooner than he did)Morrow doesn't know when to turn off the stylist in himself. I once heard a critic call Robert James Waller's writing style ""gaseous"". That critic obviously hasn't opened this book. I'll go one step further and call Morrow's style gastric (as in distress)."
5,Clever and Inspiring,Stories That The World Once Told has quickly become one of my favorite CDs to listen to during my lunch break. The songs are fun and relaxing. I often let the tunes play while my 5th grade students work. The music seems to inspire independent thought. Rosetta Pebble is clever and witty. You too will find yourself whistling the songs throughtout your day! Rosetta Pebble Rocks!! (Get it?)
4,Great marriage advice,"This book has really been helpful - coming from a couple who has experienced heartache in marriage, they offer practical tips for growing your marriage. The focus on God as the center of your marriage and on changing your own attitudes and behavior is key. Great investment in your marriage!"
5,MUST READ!!,There is absolutely no reason not to read this book!! Jimmy Evans relays powerful truths about marriage in a humorous and easy to understand way. Everyone from engaged couples to those married for fifty years will benefit from this incredible book. Your marriage will be strengthened and transformed as Pastor Jimmy speaks scriptural truth into tough marital issues.
5,No words can describe it.,I don't know how to express my opinion. All reviews in all sites are 5 stars maybe can prove something. :)
5,GI Canvas Barracks bag,Item received earlier than expected.The bag is of good quality and I am very satisfied with this purchase.Good merchant and can be recommended to my friends as well.
5,FANTASTIC,Anyone planning a wedding should get this CDI love the fact that you can actually hear every word in each song and the words are so beautiful and meaningful.All the different singers are great and the music is the best.I am very happy with this CD
1,"Cheesy, schmaltzy, songs that no one has ever heard of...","I agree with the reviewer who suspects that all the glowing reviews of this CD have been ""planted"" by the artist's friends and the like. First of all, these songs are just plain bad. The vocals are amateur. Secondly, none of these songs have ever charted, so your wedding guests won't really be able to relate to the songs because they've never heard them before. There are plenty of popular songs that would go over much better in these situations. Sorry, but musically I have to give this CD and others like it a big, fat ""F""."
5,An Excellent CD,"I got this CD for ""A Song For My Daughter"" and ""A Song For My Son"" The bonus is all the other songs are great for our wedding too. I really like all the different singers especially Ray Allaire.My only problem is that everyone I know planning a wedding wants to use my CD.I plan on getting a couple of extra ones to give as shower gifts so that I don't have to loan mine to everyone.This is an excellent CD."
4,great product & price,Vanity is very nice & easy to put together. Only downfall is when putting the bench together the cushion didn't have any holes to put the screws into so it was hard to put that on. I had to make my own holes & when doing so it snagged the material. Glad it didnt make any holes in it. Besides that great product. THANKS
3,Dull,I loved the Daredevil/Punisher/Spiderman team-up that is in this collection but other stories are really dull.
1,A crime against art...,"Be warned, this dvd and other titles from the bootleg compnay 'Video Asia' is of unbelievably bad quality. the picture looks like a fifth generation VHS bootleg, and worst of all, so many scenes have been removed that the film runs under 60 minutes! scenes play out of sequence as well; this product is a mess, and I wish that amazon would not even carry this stuff from ""VideoAsia."" They took a pan and scan picture, cropped off the top and bottom of the screen, and then STRETCHED the picture to fit that shape, so everyone looks strangely fat and distorted. This process cuts out about half of the original picture. Lastly, the stats offered by Amazon are wrong, (as usual.) no Cantonese language, no English subtitles. This is the usual poor English dubbed crap. The film itself was great, before this label butchered it. avoid this at all costs and hopefully a legitimate release will surface in the future."
4,Good book!!,"I have this book already, and i purchased it as a gift for someone who just adopted a puppy. the only arguement i have in the book is when it talks about pit bulls. it recommends not getting one at all. we love our pit bull and she is very, very gentle."
5,This book is all you need,"I purchased my copy of Tracie Hotchners, ""Dog Bible"" a few weeks ago and I'm glad that I did. I recommend this book to anyone who is thinking of getting a dog. I have a standard poodle who seems to have a mind of her own. I've had several questions regarding Lola and they were answered in the book. I have my share of dog books, but nothing comes close to ""The Dog Bible.""Susan Kanellakis"
5,Who Benefits More?,"Listen and Bebe, my two Beagle companions, seem to think I'm a better guardian since my reading The Dog Bible. And I agree happily but the benefit accrues to them.There is nothing I've ever wanted to know about living with a dog that I haven't found in this book. And to find this abundance of information in such a readable form is a delight.The prose is clear, friendly, informed. Whether you're beginning your life with a canine companion or experiencing the transition of loss and bereavement The Dog Bible can help. For anyone who lives with and loves a dog or knows someone who does, this is the perfect book."
5,The best dog book ever!,"Wow! This is an amazing book that covers it all - from choosing a dog, to the early years, through old age. It helps us humans accompany our doggies through every stage of their lives - and understand them too! Clearly this author knows and loves dogs! This is an incredibly comprehensive book, and one I know I will keep running to everytime I have a question - truly the bible for dog owners. It is a MUST HAVE for every human companion - I think vets should make it a required purchase for the care, feeding, and understanding of your dog! We need more books like this."
2,A bit dull,"This was my first Mary Jo Putney book, and I was a bit disapointed because she's supposed to be the paragon of regency. I never really liked four character novels, because it's a bit odd having the supposed hero insulting the heroine, and you always end up feeling bad for someone. Also, there was no internal plot. Everyone was running around assuming this that and the other thing about everyone else, which is rather flimsy when holding up the novel. I'm surprised the book was as long as it was. Still, it was Mary Jo Putney's first book, and I haven't read any of her others, so maybe this was just her ""warm up"" to the writing industry. Also, her writing is beautiful, and she has a real talent for describing things well and with little words, (I hate when a simple secene gets too wordy- but it doesn't happen here)."
2,boring book....,"I've read a few of Mary Jo Putney's books and this one is the worst I've read so far. It was boring! There didn't feel like there was any connection between the characters. Another reviewer stated that at the end, it felt like it didn't matter who ended up with who. I agree totally. It was THAT boring."
3,"First, But Not her Best","This is Putney's first book, and it shows. It's dull. The main character, Caroline, is your stereotypical ""bit of a ninny"" Regency heroine. ""The Rake"", a sequel to this book, is infinitely more enjoyable a read. In fact, it is one of Putney's finest books (I've read more than ten of them): and you don't need to read this one, to understand it. So - my advice is - skip this, and go straight to ""The Rake"": or ""The Bargain"", which I understand will shortly be re-released as well."
2,A little disappointed,"I usually LOVE Mary Jo's books. I have read all of them and when this was re-published, I was thrilled. Yet, I was disappointed at the twist. It started out great and then went downhill from there."
2,"Well-written, but not much else...","I read this book for the first time in the summer of 2004, and decided to re-visit it four years later. It hadn't made a memorable impression on me from that summer, but I did recall liking it. This time around, I was shocked by how little I had remembered about it, so unfortunately, though this set of four short stories that interlink together was interesting, it was rather forgettable. The links between the stories provided the most fascinating aspect of this rather hard to classify book as a whole. The book was certainly well written, though, but unfortunately not very relatable. When it ended, it just felt lacking... There was nothing really hatable about the book, but certainly nothing lovable either."
3,"OK pump, but not great!","It does not ""empty"" your breasts in 15 minutes like I've read....at the most in 30 min and even then...my milk supply dwindled after I started pumping. The Medela Swing was more efficient at emptying my breasts and sometimes would take the same amount of time."
1,Baffled and Frustrated,"I am baffled by the positive reviews for this product, and completely frustrated that I wasted my money on it. I rented Medela's Symphony pump and then purchased the Pump in Style Backpack and LOVED them both. I got the Swing pump because I lost my Pump in Style and I wanted to save money. Big mistake. I am so unhappy with the Swing Pump. The motor is weak; it is terrible at expressing milk. Please don't make my mistake. Get one of the other Medela pumps."
4,great for the money,I bought this because I did not want to pay so much for a pump. It really does work quicker. The only negative is that it does one breast at a time.
1,Very disappointed,"I felt I needed to write a review for this item because I couldn't believe that it is rated 4 stars! Maybe I was just expecting to much from a breast pump? As a first time mom, I chose this pump because of price and I only planned on using it occasionally. I was very disappointed when I finally got to use it. Like others said, the cord unplugs very easily, which is a hassle. Also I was only able to pump a few ounces at a time. On the plus side, the design itself is nice, attractive and easy to use, however the results I had with it were very disappointing. I really wish I would have invested in a better, more expensive one. I am now pregnant with #2 and I am looking at other pumps, wishing I wouldn't have bought this one. I hope this helps"
4,"Great pump, one big flaw","This pump is awesome. I have used a PIS and this pumps as well if not better than the PIS Original. I bought it because I never used the double pump feature and I really liked the idea I could use my own bag, use batteries in the pump, and generally have a tiny, light pump. I am thrilled on all three. My only compliant about this pump is the power plug...it ROCKETS out of the pump with the slightest twitch. I called Medela and they insist this is a safety feature. I think it is a design flaw, personally, but it can easily be resolved with a tiny piece of tape or a steady hand. I am so happy with the pump otherwise that I'm willing to overlook this. It is POUNDS lighter than the PIS as well, which is very nice. I have it in a purse with lots of pockets and it is actually lighter than my reg purse even with all of my milk bottles, milk bags, nipples, caps, and breastshields loaded in!"
3,Great for a part-time pump,"This is a great pump, it performs very well as long as you aren't trying to pump multiple times a day while at work. I would recommend this to moms who pump occasionally, but not for commuting moms. For me, it took about 40 minutes (20 minutes/breast) to get 6-8 ounces of milk. Having to do this twice a day at work got very time consuming, so I bought the Medela Pump In Style Advanced that allows me to pump both breasts at once."
4,Gets the job done.,"That's the only pump I've ever used so I can't compare it to others, but it does get the job done. I've been using it for the last 6 weeks (since my son was born) and I've been pretty happy with it. I don't pump much, usually just one bottle a day, so I'm not sure how efficient the swing would be if I needed to pump more. It's a bit loud, but it doesn't bother me. The soft shield it came with got all stretched out within a couple weeks and lowered both the comfort and efficiency when pumping - I had to get a new, regular one piece breast shield and it works much better in my opinion."
5,Very good!,Worked as well as the hospital grade pump. Only downside is that it onlt does one side at a time. If your pumping alot maybe go for the pump in style.
2,Broken after a weekend's use,"Unfortunately after using this pump for only 3 days, it broke. The motor was noticeably weaker than the Pump in Style, but I needed this for business travel. After the third day of use, the motor sounded like it was dying and it just wouldn't pump anymore. Guess I'll just go back to lugging the Pump in Style with me on my trips."
5,This is a great product,"This is a great product, and it's very easy to use. I can use it when reading, watching TV and so on."
1,Milk gets sucked up the tube!,"At first I loved this new pump -- it seemed to work much better and more efficient than my really old hand-me-down pump in style. However, that being said, it has been only a few weeks and it feels like it is harder and harder to get milk out.Also, more importantly, milk consistently gets sucked up the tubing. I hold the horn/bottle upright and keep the motor/pump higher than the bottle but for whatever reason my milk refuses to go down the correct passageway to the bottle. The horn is incredibly annoying since (unlike the older version) you can't even see what the heck is in there (parts are yellow plastic). I don't know if I have a bad horn or if I'm doing something wrong (I have NEVER had this problem with my pump in style).I'm sad that I dropped about 150 on this and it isn't all that great. I wish the baby market were a bit more reasonable...."
4,great,I love this product. For stay at home moms this is the best. the suction power was so right u dont feel the pump working too hard. it comes with the battery option and it works gr8 too...i would recommend this product to everyone.
1,Pump Stopped working,"hi,I started using the swing pump after my baby was born. The pump worked fine for the first 2 weeks. After that it's efficiency reduced dramatically, in that, it started pumping 1/4 of what it used to earlier.I know that i'm producing normally as i frequently overflow, but the pump just does not work...Working with customer support to see what can be done..For that kind of money this is certainly not expected.Will send updates if any.."
1,Stopped working after 3 months!,Had this pump not stopped working after 3 months I would have given it 4 stars. But it doesn't deserve it because it was expensive and didn't last!
1,swing pump,"This pump is absolutely horrible. I hate using it. This pump leaks, eats up batteries, and is an all out nuissance. I can't use the plug because it will not stay in the pump. It is definitely not worth the money. I wish I could return it. I had an avent pump and loved it. Wish i had bought another one."
4,"Great Pump, Great Value","This is a great pump and a great value. I use it everyday. It is comfortable, adjustable, and it works great on batteries as well. It is easy to take along in the diaper bag too. The tubing does get milk in it with the Personal Fit Adapters so you do have to watch it closely when your milk is flowing heavily. I am very happy with this pump!"
5,Love it!,Unfortunately I purchased a different pump prior to this one. I was very disappointed. I love this Medela! It's comfortable and convenient! I am able to pump discretely in almost any location. Highly recommended
5,great pump for occassional pumping,You have to have some soared time to use this pump since it only does one breast at a time but it is definitely comparable to the high quality double pumps! I would recommend!
2,Unhappy user,"if you are looking to pump a lot and have a low milk supply, don't even think about buying this. The sunction is LOW and it takes so much time, pumping one breast at a time.invest in one of the other higher grade pumps"
4,Good product,"I am a stay at home mom and I thought a manual pump would be fine, big mistake. The manual pump didn't work very well, and I could never get more than 1 ounce out of each side. I rented a pump from the hospital just to make sure I could pump, and then decided to invest the money in my own electric pump. Of course I typically only pump once a day so I didn't want to spend too much money, but I did want a quality product that will last through more children. I love how small this pump is, I pack it up every day after using it so I don't have to have it sitting out like that big one from the hospital. It travels really well too! I tried to use mine with the batteries instead of plugging it in the other day and that didn't work, but I haven't tried again using different batteries. Don't waste your money on other pumps, this is a great one."
4,Wonderful for SAHM's,"I really thought this was a wonderful pump for stay at home mom's. I'm not sure how great it would be if you were exclusively pumping during the day while working, but for my periodic uses, I loved it. I usually used it on electric power, since I thought it ate through batteries pretty quickly, but when I did need to use it on battery power (like in the car) it worked well too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt like it did not have quite as powerful of a suction on battery, but since I was usually plugged in, that wasn't an issue for me. I did use it while on vacation without my child for 5 days, pumping at least 6 times per day, including two 8 hour car trips, and it worked great!"
4,Great!! But...BE CAREFUL!!,"I love this pump!! It is perfect for occasional pumping but whatever you do make sure you DO NOT OVER FILL THE BOTTLE!! If you over fill the bottle it will go up into the motor and stop working. In the instruction manual they tell you how to fix this problem but I followed their advice and it still didnt work. I called customer service and they could not help me. They said I would just have to buy a new one because my one year warranty is up. So, great pump!!! But...again, Whatever you do, DONT OVER FILL THE BOTTLE!!!!"
5,"Great price, Great pump!","My baby isn't drinking milk from the breast, she does not latch on, so I have to pump and give her a bottle. This is the second pump I have gotten and I LOVE IT. it is quick and very effective in keeping up my milk supply. I highly recommend it!Mary"
2,Not for me,"Well, this pump must work for some people, based on the number of good reivews, but it doesn't work for me--unless I have over an hour to pump 4 oz. I don't know whether it is the suction or the speed, but it just takes forever to get not nearly enough milk! Also, this pump has turned off on me for no reason! (I work from home and don't pump often, so nothing should be worn out yet!)I really like the fact that it is a single pump, as I only pump one side at a time, but this product just isn't good enough to feed my daughter with a bottle, forget about keeping my supply up. So, I'm still on the search for a good pump. (Lansinoh is my next try, even though it's a double.)Good luck!"
5,Great Product,The product is perfect for a stay-home Moms. It's effective and extra quiet compared to other pumps.
5,Medela pump review,I bought this as a gift for someone who had recently had a baby. She loves it - says it is quiet and efficient.
1,Weak pump and gets milk in the tubing,"What a huge waste of money. I have a Pump in Style Advanced which I love. But I leave it at work and one day, I was staying home sick when I realized that my baby was at daycare and my pump was at work and I was in trouble. So, I went out and dropped $150 on the Medela Swing. I was pleased with my purchase since I liked my pump in style so much and I thought this would be fine for very occasional use. First of all, the swing has increadibly weak suction. It took me over 30 minutes on each side just to get my breasts down to a comfortable level, not even to empty them completely! I shudder to think what this one sick day of pumping will do to my supply for the next few days. Plus, the little white flange doesn't open and close with each pump like it's supposed to. As a result, your milk gets trapped in the little yellow flap and then flows up into the tubing! If you are buying a breast pump, please please please shell out the extra money for the Pump In Style."
2,"ok, but .....","i bought the swing for pumping milk after my third baby. my previous pump, an avent, had broken and from the reviews i was led to believe the medela swing would be better. its ok - a bit better than the avent but not enough to justify the extra cost. The suction is less than i would have wanted and also loses strength if you use just battery power. the pumping tubes do not secure well into the pump or bottle so have a tendency to slip out - a very irritating design fault. Condensation forms in the tubes quickly and can go mouldy. It does the job but with a bit of tinkering by the medela design team, it could work even better."
2,not durable,"Pump stopped working after 2 weeks usage , simply not a durable device , the motor of the pump works but it seems something in the pump failed , the pump mechanism is sealed so its useless at the moment.I recommend going for the higuer end medela pump , i tried to save some money buying this model for my wife and ended up buying the higuer double pump model which is more durable.DONT recommend this specific model."
1,"Reliable brand, over priced pump","This is a good pump but it is pretty weak. I have a problem with my milk supply and this was not the pump to help with that problem. It is absolutely not worth paying over $100 for. For what this pump does I suggest purchasing a cheap manual pump, do your research and know what you need before you buy any pump on the market."
5,"Great Customer Service, Great product!","I recieved my swing as a shower gift just short of a year ago. One day it didn't turn on. So I called customer service.They asked me to check it with batteries and it worked. They sent me out a new power cable for the next day.I have needed it many times to increase milk supply... my baby, though a good sucker(no pun intended), never had much patience at the nipple,so as a result wasn't getting much at a time.I have been very happy with the function of it. It's just a bit of a pain to clean. I would recommend the sterilizing bags."
3,It works,It works..not the greatest thing and I should have opted for the better one. The good thing about this product is is has troubleshooting instructions incase water or milk get into the motor (it will still work!) the bad thing is it happens all the time and I have to flush it out everytime.
4,Good choice,"I am very pleased with this model. It is great for the price, if you only pump occasionally. It is a bit noisy, but otherwise I have no complaints whatsoever. It is easy to clean and assemble and the pumping action is smooth and comfortable with a great range of adjustment for suction strength.3 month update: It's still purring along beautifully- not good if you're going to pump alot, but a couple times per day s fine. Caution- the air travels directly through the motor, so if you get milk in it look in the instruction manual for how to clean."
4,Good breast pump,I am very happy with my Medela Swing Breast Pump. I highly recommend this pump for someone who is primarily nursing and just needs a pump for a little extra milk to store. It would not work very well for a mom trying to only pump and give baby bottles because it is a single pump. You could make it work but it would take a LONG time because you have to pump each breast separately instead of at the same time like with a double pump. When I first started using this pump I noticed my nursing pad would be soaked on the breast I was not pumping. I started holding an empty bottle under that breast to catch all that milk instead of losing it in my pad. This pump works well and is so easy to use!
2,Not impressed,This breast pump hurt so much! I borrowed another Medela pump and I had to keep it because this one was just too painful to use. It's pretty looking and sleek but that doesn't make up for the discomfort. I have to add that the one I borrowed from my sister hurt her and this one didn't so I believe this one might work for other people...
2,Sucks Up Milk!! Not Worth The Money$$,"I am in the process of returning this pump after 2 months of use (Dec 2012 - Jan 2013). Too many times the milk is sucked up in the tube, and even spills because it is not letting down into the bottle - very annoying. Not convenient for travelling either, as it has too many parts to walk with and the tube should be longer (the Deluxe Single pump is most convenient for travel purposes - just get a good brand battery).The motor's hum is tolerable but could be quieter (horribly loud on the single deluxe). Very disappointed in the infamous Medela brand on this item. I have to pump a lot for my preemie baby so I rented the Symphony and it works great with a low hum! (just not portable). Currently checking out the knapsack one to see if I should buy it..."
5,Rarely,"Rarely have I come across a book or manual that has been as infomative as this one. The book covers in detail and clarity of how to do accomplish the most basic and most advanced functions that final cut 4 has to offer. In addition, all the pictures and illustrations are great and easy to understand."
5,Great book!,I only wish I had more time to spend with this book. I am fortunatly busy editing! Everytime I sit down with this thing it changes the way I edit. It is clearly written and takes you through good editing techniques as well as how to use FCP to accomplish them. Best $35 I ever spent.Dan S.iPeace.tv
1,Candida has made better ones,"Candida has made some movies worth watching. This isn't one of them unless you are totally visual. There is no plot here. It's a series of mini episodes, boy meets girl, no dialogue which leads to their fun. Watching it was a bore. My wife and I have enjoyed Candida's movies because there is usually a simple little story wrapped around a few intimate scenes. This one lacks a plot, has no dialogue, and no conclusion. If you are a first time buyer, try another of Candida Royalle's offerings and don't waste your time with this one."
4,Naked home truth,"Since an older and unloved husband's passing away, a 42y.o. widow tries to survive with two teen daughters exploring their blossoming sexualities beyond traditional family boarders surely.At different levels and in different situations depicting life-happening affairs between the Jews in the Jewish State presents real Israel stripped from nave affection if some related chastity even still existed recently."
5,A Must Read for Divorced Parents,"As a divorce (aka) matrimonial lawyer, I review books involving the effects of divorce on children because it is important to my practice and clients. This is perhaps one of the best books on the subject. Many books on divorce are pessimistic in terms of their overall approach and focus. Dr. Emery is one of the few individuals who basis his writings, etc., on controlled studies as to the effect of divorce upon children (instead of the norm of opinions based upon anecdotes). On my own web site I have recommended this book."
3,Combination mystery/alterate history book.,"This books imagines that Prince Eddy, engaged to marry the late Queen Mary of England, never died. In fact, he did, and she married his brother, King George, the parents of the current Queen Elizabeth. (I think) It's a good thing they put a pedigree chart in the front, because I couldn't keep all these imaginary people straight and I had to keep referring back to it. I suppose the main reason for writing it like this is that the writer can imagine his own royal family instead of having to deal with the one we've got. But I was rather confused. I think the author should have decided to write either a straight mystery based on real people, one based wholely on imaginary people, or an alternate reality book. Instead it's a mix. The characters were well drawn but the mystery was a little unclear and the whole thing was confusing. Some of the relationships were a little unbelievable too."
1,Vanity exposed,"Ron Marlar (a retired USAF officer, college professor, school teacher, living currently in Florida)Okay, I admit at the outset I prefer more traditional poetry distinguishable in some form from prose. Relics in the Closet is, therefore, most unsatisfying to me. I had a sense of seeing, unwillingly, into the dark musings of a troubled mind as I read this little collection. It reminded me of reading some years ago the work of a mentally damaged person assigned by a psychiatrist to write as a cathartic exercise to help the writer put behind her the murder of her husband.Vanity published this book reveals the real meaning of vanity, that of the author of the book."
4,New perspective,"The author presents a different way to look on bugs and the debugging process. I could recognize most of the bug patterns as regular acquaintances from my daily work. What I liked most was the way he made clear how Java's type system can be used to eliminate certain kinds of bugs but that there's a trade off between static typing and duplication in code. In other words, to remove some sorts of duplication you sometimes have to forgo static typing in Java."
2,I don't get it,"Maybe I'm not looking at it as a child, but I don't get it. It doesn't follow the storyline. I hid the book so I don't have to read it. Every once in a while I'll take it out again to give it ""just one more chance"" and all it does is confirm that I still don't like it."
3,Whistle for,"Peter wants to learn to whistle, but he can't. Therefore, throughout the story Peter cannot whistle. Yet, all of sudden he can whistle we he is hiding in carton. In the beginning of the story, he had the same carton, but couldn't whistle. It is not clear what changed from the beginning to the end of the story. I did not like the resolution of the problem."
3,Whistle for Willie,"The book "" Whistle for Willie "" isn't the best book I have ever read. Although it was a pretty good one. This book is about a little boy named Peter and his dog Willie. One day Peter sees another boy whistling and playing with his dog. Peter decides it would be really cool if he could whistle for Willie. So he tries to, but he doesn't know how to. He tryed like five times, but still he couldn't get a noise to come out. Finally he gets it to work and he gets all happy and plays with his dog.Now this book kind of shows that if you wanted something bad enough you shouldn't give up. You should keep going for whatever you want untill you get it, as long as what you want is resonable. This book does remind me of me in a way. Ever since I was about four years old I have wanted a Corvette. And I am hoping that one day if I stick to what I want that I will get it. And by the book, it looks like I just might."
1,Amazon buyer beware,"I purchased this item and discovered that the instructional DVD would not play.I telephoned Medicus and was informed that my product was a fake, counterfeit, and knock-off.I telephoned the Customer Support @ Amazon, and was told that they ONLY deal directly with the manufacturer. Medicus says, that the product that I was sold,,, isn't an authentic Medicus product.Amazon advised that they would replace my item,,, but what are the odds that I would get another ""knock off"" ?Shame on you Amazon. All 1372 people in my Facebook know about this also."
3,Very Interesssssting!,"Fascinated by snakes? You might be after watching this. Serpent caves and rituals, how the snake has been revered and done wrong over the years; a look from every angle."
5,Well done documentary...,"I personally have no complaints with this video, I thought it was fantastic. I am studying ancient serpent worship myself, and Mr. Gardiner has obviously done his research, and if you read his books you will know that too. No, this isn't flashy, it's not particularly entertaining--it is factual, but I found it refreshing in its simplicity. Mr. Gardiner is really onto something with his study of Ophiolatreia, and this film proves it.If you wanted slick and perfect, look elsewhere. If you want astonishing facts, this is a great video. If you want to know more on the subject, I would recommend his books, especially ""Secrets of the Serpent"" and his fictional novel ""The Brotherhood of the Snake."""
3,"Informative, but loud back ground music ruins it.","Much unknown information was presented here. It is up to you to take in what you want and leave the rest. I, personally, enjoyed it. However, the music was too loud and annoying. Music in the background should be consciously unnoticed but adds a small element of additional enjoyment when used. This music often drowned out what the man was saying. Not good. No music would have been best. It would have at least 4 stars if not for the irritating music."
1,Most boring video,Better watch something for free on Youtube. This is boring. Narrator is boring and keeps mumbling throughout. His reasoning is questionable. Keeps referring to non existent practices in different places with no proof.
1,Poor design,Whem you turn off the spigot this device sprays water everywhere including on the person turning off the water. OK for places where overspray is not a problem. Definetly do not use indoors.
4,Great book for the MBLEX,"I ordered this book to study for my upcoming MBLEX exam, I have heard great reviews from several different sources (massage therapy study sites, colleges, friends, teachers, and here) so I decided to buy it. Honestly quite a bit of what is in this book we never even went over in college so I am glad I did buy it. It doesn't list things that you don't need to know, no excessive paragraphs that aren't needed, no excessive page after page of exaggerating. There isn't one negative thing I can say about the book at all, only the shipping (which explains the four stars). The shipping took much longer than expected, I wished I had payed extra to ship it instead of the 'free super saving shipping'. Great book for a study guide for the MBLEX or the NCETMB/NCETM. Worth the money, I ordered the 'spiral bound' book and I love it."
5,Great Study Tool,This book was a tremendous help to me and it was very easy to use. It helped me throughout my schooling and was a great study guide for nationals. I recommend it highly.
2,I could have passed without this book,"I have been out of school for 4 years and I needed to take the Nationals, I heard this book was the best. It may have been the best for people taking the Nationals in 2003 but there were only about 5 questions that even resembled what the practice exams in the book were. I know that I could have passed the Nationals without studing for a month and a half with this book and passed. I think they need to revise this book for the 2004 Nationals."
2,Not what I expected,I gave the lower rating because I was expecting a more thorough book to study for. I started off using this book to study for my national test and realized that I was better off reviewing my text from school. It's too general and not enough information to explain what your studying. Would work good to review things while in business. Would not recommend utilizing only this book to pass the national.
5,I PASSES THE BOARDS!!!,"Ok guys I flunked the test the first time. I then got serveral books and finding out what they really are this is the book you need to be studing. Every question that is on the test is in this book. It took me only 45 minutes to take the test. Folks get this book, read it well, study it and you will get high in all the areas like I did. ..."
3,"Not bad, but please see the full review","Noh Chin-Hwa published this book on Korean snacks and side dishes along with two companion volumes covering other aspects of the cuisine. All three have also been published in a combined volume entitledPractical Korean Cooking. I purchased and reviewed the combined volume and awarded it 4 stars. I subsequently ordered this book not realizing that it is, in fact, nothing but the last two chapters of my first purchase with a different cover. It would have been nice if I could have been made aware of this before spending my money."
4,Korean for beginners,"This is a wonderful book about the Korean culture and how it plays into the style of cooking that has been around for centuries, and on all continents of the globe. I have to say, my experience with the culure was wonderful. The service was impeccable, as was the food being served. Sitting on the floor for a meal took some getting used to. But I barely noticed any pain as I enjoyed any and every item placed in front of my face. It was and adventure that this book took me on, that reminded me of my experience of living well. Enjoy the adventures of eating what the body was meant to consume with ease and comfort."
2,Slow-Downs and Speed-Ups Destroys This Game,"I could not wait to get the expansion to the best game I've played in a while. When I got it, I could not believe how such a small glitch could suck all the fun out of an otherwise great game. The glitch is the frequent slow-downs and sudden speed-ups or even pauses while you are playing. I got killed a lot because the game would pause near a horde of monsters and when it un-pauses the monsters will be all over my character and he will be killed, or it would speed-up and I can't keep up with the monsters attacks. THQ advices that you should not teleport a lot in the game to avoid this problem, but why should we stop using a main feature of the game, why didn't THQ solve this problem. Furthermore, I suffer from this problem even before I teleport? And believe me it's a problem that will annoy the most loyal fans of the game."
3,TQ - Immortal Throne,"The upgrade is a genuine upgrade. But what the product really needs is a way to generate new maps. The characters are interesting, but it gets tiresome finding the same things in the same places every time."
4,Great expansion,"I like this expansion because you can wait until you beat the original game before loading your character into it, or start a character within the expansion pack right away. The artifact and new scrolls to use in battle are excellent and with new armor sets and the dream mastery, you just cannot go wrong."
3,Titan Quest A must do for this summer,Fun game takes awhile to get used to but excellent overall game play. Awesome new graphics and use of physics.
3,not enough,"Sometimes, Domingo does too many things at the same time. Here, he sings, presents the singers and musicians etc... I like very much Domingo as a singer, but don't love him. Here, I found an ordinary Domingo, not enough songs sang by him, etc... No definitly not this vhs"
3,A Bit Difficult,"This is a fun game and easier if used as just a card matching game. It is difficult when using the clues. The picture cards are very ""busy"" and I had a hard time finding some items to match my clues. My 3 year old is much too young for this game. My 5 1/2 year old has a hard time trying to find all of the matches for her clues. It takes a long time to play and at her age it's not one of her favorite games. It's better for older children."
4,Fun for the whole family,"This is a fun game or the entire family. No reading is required. It's great for developing memory skills and requires kids to focus and pay attention if they want to do well. Our 5-year-old son had a ball and won the first game we played together and my husband and I enjoyed it as well. We liked that the matching cards are not exactly alike. You are looking for the same main object in the picture, but the backgrounds are different, which makes the game a bit more interesting and challenging than your basic memory game."
3,a good idea,"I am confused...I look at the star ratings and read the reviews...but they don't even come close to my thoughts. This book was an interesting read. They do show a huge variety of techniques that are used for the stage... but they only give you a small taste of the process...Vacuum forming for example, a wonderful process, but zippo info on whereto/howto/whoto contact to buy or to make one. Read this book to get an overview of some ideas...but know that the technology shown is old and past its prime. I know stagework is seen at a distance..but you will not be impressed with the craftsmanship of the projects. Heads up on some safety issues..they skip right over that. oh my."
3,Sound but slightly dated,"I purchased this book as a text for a maskmaking class for my theater degree. I'll repeat the instructor's gist, if not her words: This is a great book on the basic technical aspects of maskmaking. However, there are a lot of other materials that are now available if you have the budget that aren't covered in this book. The photos are good but not always clear, and I agree with some other reviewers that there is a definite lack of practical information such as where to buy maskmaking supplies.Worth a read, particularly if you're into Commedia masks or working in community theater on a small budget."
3,Outdated,This book was written for what seems to be primarily leather working as half the book is dedicated to this art form. There is nothing about foam latex or any of the other current methods of making masks. It's seriously dated and not worth the cost unless you want to make leather masks.
5,the wait was worth it!,"Altough it took soooo long before we finally could listen to new music of Javier Garcia. His album of 1997 has a prominent place in my Latin popcollection (Ricky Martin, Juanes, Robi Draco Rosa, Jorge Moreno, Alejandro Sanz, Mana, Carlos Vives, Santana and much more) and ""13"" will have that too.The first impression is ...great, dancable caribean music.. At first I missed the slow, jazzy songs with those typical Javier sounds, but taking more time to listen i decided: it's all there. The music has more ""modern"" sounds like rap, well i am not good in putting names on music. I just know i am totally hooked on this album since i have it and it has the right mix of various styles to keep me interested for a long time!Lucile (Netherlands) www.javiergarciafan.tk"
5,Unparalleled,"After listening to Javier Garcia's albums everything else sounds, well . . . amateurish. His work may never be understood or fully appreciated by those who soak up the mainstream radio fare and believe Ricky Martin to be a musical prodigy.However, if you like fresh, provocative and intelligent music that grows more complex and beautiful with each listen (my apologies to Juanes, Carlos Vives, and Mana), then add this to your collection of música Latina."
1,Stupid,Sydney Lattimore acts so stupid and so impossible for the time period the story is not even funny. It's irritating.I just cannot imagine that a female like this could attract attention of any gentleman at all.
5,Works fine with 705,I worried a bit when I bought this battery if it would work on the Archos 705 as well as the 704. But it fits perfectly and works great with the 705.
4,Hepinstall thrills again!,"Having read Hepinstall's other two novels, I was hoping not to be let down by Prince of Lost Places. She not only succeeded in keeping me flipping the pages, but left me thinking about the ending for days. This book makes you want to give it to everyone you know and discuss it!She has proved her staying power in her third novel and is a permanent addition to my collection of great authors."
5,Glad I found PRINCE OF LOST PLACES.,"I read this book in just over a day and loved it. Kathy Hepinstall tells a simple story about a mother who ""steals"" her son and goes off on an adventure to live in a cave hoping to protect him from the real world. The story and style remind me of Cormac McCarthy's Child of God and William Gay's Twilight, two other gothic novels. I have to admit I was not prepared or expecting the surprise ending, which made the book a special treat. I look forward to reading Hepinstall's other novels, THE ABSCENCE OF NECTAR and THE HOUSE OF GENTLE MEN."
3,interesting,I found myself not quite sure if this was general fiction or fantasy...I flipped through the pages so fast to find out the ending to the story. Really liked the story but found this to best suited for a short story or novella.
3,The Illusions of Your Mind.,"Martha, an Ohio wife and mother, flees to a cave along the Rio Grande when violence disrupts her peaceful home. Her husband sends a detective on her trail, and love blossoms. This quirky little tale is fine for readers who enjoy their suspense flavored with plot twists and psychological overtones. The pace is leisurely. Tension builds slowly. The climax of the novel is sudden and leaves the readers putting their own spin on the story. Knowing the difference between reality and illusion plays a major part. Think of a romantic Twilight Zone episode and you get the idea. Kathy Hepinstall enjoys a credible reputation as a rising author of suspense novels. This is good lite reading. ;-)"
2,"Clearly written, reads fast","There is no subtlety in this clearly written, fast-paced tale, which seems to lack any relationship to what is feasible even by a mentally disturbed mother. My realistic soul simply could not accept that even one in the central character's mental condition could do and effectuate what she is related to have done and accomplished. Possibly one should suspend one's view of reality when reading another's fictional creation, but I never was one much for fantasy and anyway this does not, at least overtly, purport to be fantasy. Nor could I applaud the ending. But I am not one to judge a book of this genre. I kept wondering whether this is supposed to be a Harlequin-type book (I've never read such so...), or ""young adult""? But I guess it is classified as a psychological thriller, but evidence of psychological veracity if present was not noticed by me. But I am no psychologist. I felt reading this book was not a valuable use of my time."
1,Not hepinstall's best,"Kathy has crafted her books, but this one seems rushed. It is very short and the plot suffers from the lazy effort. The ending was not a shocker, as any alert reader would pick up on by page four. Sorry, but I did not like this book."
3,Weird,"Not what I expected from the jacket blurb. The premise...thar a mpther would feel safer in the wilds of Texas rather than fleing to a big city with the consequent anonymity is unsettling, and the ending is just....WEIRD!"
4,BOXES FOR BOOKS DVD - Peter Goodwin -pal,Watching a master craftman such as Peter Goodwin work was a joy. He is a jolly fellow that loves his craft and enjoys sharing his knowledge. Well worth the your time and money - any one of Mr Goodwin's subtle tricks of the trade will improve your craftmanship.At first the homespun camera work and editing is a little off putting - but look past that and focus on watching Mr. Goodwin at work. However the music is the worst ever. I finally watched the video with the sound off.I plan on watching all the videos in this series
3,Worth reading,"An adventure/espionage yarn with a romantic backdrop which provides a device for the actual telling of the story.An American visiting London on the eve of WW1 begins to correspond with a woman via an advertisement in the agony column. His letters to her become more and more suspenseful as he is drawn into a web of murder and international intrigue.I read it in one sitting, iirc. It isn't very long and it reads quickly and easily, with a 'surprise' twist at the end you will see coming a million miles away.BTW, this book, and most of Biggers' others, including the Charlie Chan series, are in the public domain, so once again, the Kindle price is way way too much. They are freely and legally available in various places and formats."
1,Unreliable,"I had major problems with the Rev 70. It works fine for copying a small volume of files, but anytime I use it the way I intended when I bought it - to copy large numbers of image files - almost invariably it will abort with an I/O error. Also, anytime I connect to it via a network share the Rev 70 file structure becomes corrupt."
4,Fast and Easy to Use,"I've had this drive in two of my shops for a month and a half now. One was having intermittent issues with extremely long backup times (21 Hours for approx. 45GB), but that was resolved with a firmware update. The other has been running properly with no issues. If these are as reliable as the 35GB models I'll stay happy."
5,Cinnamon & Ginger Tea,"Tazo Chai Organic Spiced Black Tea is a blend of black tea, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves and star anise. These items are all organically grown and this creates a sense of purity and clarity of thought.The tea has a delicious rich flavor and is perfectly blended for an ultimate Chai experience. Delicious when you add a packet of Stevia and a swirling of orange blossom honey. Milk powder makes this richer and a dash of cream makes it luxurious.While drinking this tea you are transported to India where Chai wallahs sooth your soul with a cup of spicy tea. Each cup of Tazo tea is an adventure and this tea is especially delicious.~The Rebecca Review"
5,Tea time !,As soon as you peel the wrapper and get a smell of this tea you know you are going to enjoy it.it is a very nice tea to enjoy anytime.Great product.Thank you !
2,what's going on?,"I loved the Tazo Organic Chai spiced black tea (at first). I brewed it a cup of hot water, no sweeteners. The tastes was good, it gave me a calming feeling, I felt mentally sharp, and could focus. However, the bad news is that 12 hours later, I could not sleep at night! I watched the clock tick all night long. After two days of this, I suspected the tea (as the only thing different in my routine). Since I have a personal and family history of hypertension (although under control by diet, medication, and exercise), I checked by BP that morning when I could not sleep: 148/98 and a pulse of 98! Something in that tea (I suspect) is interacting with my system. I don't ever want to go through this before., Has anyone else experienced this???"
1,This could have been good BUT,the CD is typical of bad mastering. Everything is compressed and shrill sounding. Please girls take a lesson from Brian Wilson on recording quality.
3,Ah California!,"Wilson Phillips are truly California girls with music in their blood and genes. Chynna Phillips, the daughter of John Phillips from the legendary Mamas and Papas and Brian Wilson's daughters, Carnie and Wendy Wilson. They are second generation singers.Wilson Phillips was a musical trio with harmony in check. This compilation is really their homage to their home state of California and their tribute to songs that have inspired and influenced them."
4,Wilson phillips-2004 album,"i have been a fan of wilson phillips for a long time. they are a kind of guilty pleasure for me. their music makes me feel good and i the songs are things i can relate to.i bought this album recently and i liked it a lit. when i did buy it i thought it was a cd of brand New music that is until i got it and heard it and loved it.they do cover songs by fleetwood mac,''you can go your own way'' which is a very good song. they picked music from the 60's era from bands like the Beach boys and the youngbloods. songs most know of but they give insight into what wilson phillips likes and what influenced them as well. any fan of wilson phillips would like this album and any fan of the bands they cover on here would like this album as well. the girls sound great and this was their first cd since they had gotten back together and it shows they still are wonderful singers."
3,"Great harmonies, but","Subtract a star for being overproduced. Sometimes you just want to hear the voices unprocessed, without all the reverb and other baloney. Subtract another star for the horrible recording. The high treble sizzles. ""S's,"" ""T's,"" and ""Ch's"" sound like needles they're so sharp. ""Old Man"" is particularly bad in this regard. I don't fault the singers, just the morons who produced this. The last track, ""In My Room,"" and the hidden track, the second ""Already Gone,"" are the gems here and nearly redeem the purchase. Well-recorded, no treble-trouble, energetic and ""unplugged."" Had the rest of the CD been like the second ""Already Gone,"" the CD would have been something special."
2,Not bad but it feels like a ripoff,"I used to like this band. Good, easy-listening AOR-pop. This album isn't a huge disappointment but a bunch of cover songs after so big hiatus doesn't really convince me that this band is really back.18$ for this CD is a ripoff, it's very short. But what the heck, it has nice cover picture of the girls sitting cute and barefoot on the sofa.Save your money and buy some of their old albums instead."
5,Wilson Phillips on Howard Stern on 06-01-2004!,"Wow! The ladies revealed more than music, haha! Wilson Phillips performed ""Already Gone"" and it was the BOMB! Howard (his crew too) loved it. You can tell that he did because he never interrupted the interview for a moment. After the performance everybody including Howard praised them for a wonderful rendition. And the listeners just loved it too... They had nothing negative to say about them. Howard's listeners can be very brutal and I think the ladies just won another audience! They are just loved!!! They're excellent! After this appearance I have to give them a 5! I have officially changed their rating from a 4 to now a perfect 5!"
3,I WAITED 12 YEARS FOR THIS ?,"Rather than updateing their sound they unfortunatly chose to go back in time Please dont get me wrong, there is NO bigger Wilson Phpllips fan then I but I cant begin to tell you how disapointed I was to find out that this was going to be just another cover album. apearently so was everyone else (the album flopped) It kills me to say this, butI think their 2000 GREATEST HITS cd was truely their greatest hits and none of these songs are worthy enough to wear the title. Im sure that your diehard W P fan would agree. The only reason that Igave this album 3 stars at all is that I was still somewhat impressed with their GRAMMY winning talent to combine their three voices into one amazing harmony.They truely are gifted in this sense."
2,Not the greatest comeback,"While it appears on the surface a cd full of remakes would be ideal as the perfect comeback, however for Wilson Phillips who only had two albums to begin with isnt such a great move. The only good songs I care for is ""Your No Good"" & ""You Can Go Your Own Way"" & Already Gone. They sound like they should be bonus cuts on a Wilson Phillips Cd with all new material. To wait so many years for them to get back together and record something only luke warm, isnt very exciting. I say pick up greatest hits and hope they come out with a album of all new material instead. Note: There is also a hidden track acoustic version of Already Gone which sounds pretty good."
4,"Easy, breezy, delicious","Wilson Phillips is back again with ""California,"" an album that covers songs all about or from their native state. As on their other albums, the harmonies are crisp, clean and filled with light--no surprise, since the three have been singing together since childhood.A couple of the tracks are uninspired, but others are a lovely surprise. ""Go Your Own Way"" is transformed from Fleetwood Mac's propulsive ""go to hell"" version into something filled with melancholy, tenderness and heartache. ""In My Room"" sounds just as gorgeous here as it did when the Beach Boys recorded it, and in fact, Papa Brian Wilson sits in on piano and vocals.Carnie Wilson is a delight on ""Old Man"" and ""Get Together""--the caramel richness of her voice is appropriately dark for these two songs and on the rest of the album, she anchors the soaring, more lightweight voices of her sister Wendy and of Chynna Phillips. The album is fluff--it's sweet--it's lightweight--but it's also lovely to listen to."
4,Welcome back girls !!,"I am not a fan of concept albums, but in this case it is Wilson Phillips we are talking about - so I'll gladly make an exception and listen-up ! But in my own words I think I have just admitted the problem with this particular concept album -it will largely appeal to their existing (and loyal) fans only. Please don't get me wrong - I have always loved the music of Wilson Phillip's and 'California' (especially the tracks 'go your own way', 'old man' and 'california') is no exception !! I just wish their label had made the decision to release an album of original material, a concept I believe would have certainly appealed much more to old and new fans alike and allowed much more of an impact on the charts. Regardless, I love this CD and to be honest I'm just glad to have the girls back on the radio !!"
3,Sweet California Harmony Revisited,"O.k, I would have prefered an album of new self- penned material,however if anyone is going to do fresh versions of California classics like ""Go Your Own Way"" and ""Monday Monday"" and ""Already Gone"", then let it be the lovely Wilson sisters and Miss Chynna Baldwin(Phillips}. Their harmonies wash over you like waves on a beach and why shouldn't they? It's in their genes. These girls are California harmony personified. I'm sure old man Wilson is proud and Papa John is smiling down from Heaven. These girls are like an old Doo-Wop group who have harmonised together since childhood and know when and how to wrap their sweet voices around each other and soothe and calm the listener. In these troubled times, this is good musical comfort food."
5,Major comback from Wilson Phillips,"Comeback albums usually ask questions - both of the performer and the listener. For Wilson Phillips, ""California"" is a perfect comeback album. And it asked of them a big question: what could they do to follow up the phenomenally successful debut ""Wilson Phillips""?, a set which has sold around 10 million copies world wide alone.The answer poses the listener's question. While ""California"" was a passionate, down-to-earth and featured perfect three part harmonies that blended so beautifully as one voice. ""California"" narrows mostly concentrating on their mature voices and not to mention on the new sounds on the remakes.Sure, some of these tracks on their own will stand-up beautifully on radio, there's 2 to 3 obvious singles. And, sure, radio programmers across a broad band are going to love it.""California"" isn't Wilson Phillips's greatest album - that has yet to come. Wilson Phillips perhaps deserved better than to be tucked away in the easy to handle basket."
1,What in the name of God is this?,"This may very well be the worst thing that has ever entered my ears. These covers are nothing more than musical blasphemy. Dear God, Why have you punished us so?"
1,BAD,"Bad, really bad. I got it at the library, put it in my car cd, listened for a while, and put it back in the book drop. Treacle."
2,Waited for this???,"I'm definitely a big fan of their earlier work, but I can't believe they let their fans wait ten years for THIS. An overproduced covers album? You've gotta be kidding me. Coming back to sing songs that you didn't even write is not exactly the best way to re-establish your musical relevance and artistic credibility. These three need to get back to the studio and actually CREATE an album, show they have something new to say, and then I'll consider it a comeback. This... this generic offering just shows that the girls can sing, which, thank you very much, I already knew. Very disappointed."
2,just ok,nothing original here&you gotta wonder why they even bother coming back on alot of levels.Musically they are just kinda there.they may do a song or two alright but on a whole they have never moved me&this Album of covers doesn't so any growth then when they had there little run in the early 90's.same ole same they just took off a Decade basically.
1,Enough with the cover songs!!!!,I can't believe they make a comeback after 12 years and we get an album full of cover songs!!! Where's the original songs that made their first album huge???? Either these broads better write their own music or they'll be history!!!!!!
3,You call this a comeback????,"Come one Wilson Phillips! I figured after taking a 11-year leave, you would be coming out with some of your own material instead of 60s remakes! I thought you had enough time to plan your comeback album! I know you can do MUCH better! Nice Try, Wilson Phillips!"
5,Where were you....,Welcome back!Great voicesGreat harmoniesBest pop album by a girls group in a long time... since 1992!I missed you!
4,i don't want to admit this: but i LOVE IT!,"this is so easy to listen to... it is really good ""house cleaning sing-along"" music.it is just easy. like as sunday morning.seriously."
5,California's Golden Girls...,"are back! And they chose really good material for their comeback. Terrific, too bad the album didn't get promoted basically, I think its one of their finest.xx"
4,Sunny ~ Golden Road with CALIFORNIA ^_^,"Though I'm not a big fan , please don't miss this GREAT SUMMER CD. Easy listening & Sunny !!! Always having good mood with this album !!!California is so far away between my hometown. When the CD play in my house - car - or heard on the streets....their harnonies go strong & warm ~ all of them sounds better than ever~ specially Wendy . the songs in California is perfect. They were all classic in 60' & 70' which is the golden age bright California !!!And three girls cover the song by the W.P. style.It's amazing~ With the CD ~ I can imagine the pacific ocean high way ~ and views of california on my mind. And even make a wish to work hard for a trip to California.... of course the CD will on the way .too."
4,Enjoyable pop with Wilson Phillips!,"We can always ask for more, but this is a solid effort. The vocals are nice and crisp. The harmonies are excellent and we already know the lyrics to these standards. Peter Asher's arrangements are not quite up to par. Brian Wilson would have probably been a good choice to produce this one, but the vocals are what we came for and they are very good. This one is better than their last effort and not as strong as the first one. The one thing that is for sure, while we are fighting senseless wars and facing record gas prices, this is something very familiar that we can enjoy and the girls sound like they had a blast putting California together. Start the car, pop in the CD and go back in time. You'll be glad you did!"
2,Dissapointed,"As a fan of Wilson Phillips and these great old songs, I was so excited to get this CD. I was so dissappointed. I thought the arrangments were horrid and the singing left a lot to be desired. It almost felt like they were trying to hard and it wasn't working for them.If you're a fan of the original tunes I say pass. If you just like wilson phillips you'll probably enjoy this."
3,Disappointed in no new material,"Wilson Phillips reunited a couple of years ago and recorded an album of California pop hits from the 1960s and 1970s. The album is ok, but, after all these years out of the music spotlight, I am disappointed that they did not record any new material."
3,Fair to Midland,"You probably need to like Wilson Phillips to enjoy this CD, it will likely not bring in any new listeners. This said, the best songs on this CD are sung by Wendy:California and Dr. My Eyes. Carnie gets some credit for her Neil Young cover, the rest of the CD is fair not great and certainly not bad. In fairness, I need to give this disc more listens, I believe it may grow on me more. Another criticism is the pace of many of these songs seems off to me, perhaps I am clinging to the originals to closely but there is a disconnect here between the origins of these songs, their original performers and the current performers. The heart of most of these songs does not seemed to get captured, this is too bad."
2,little on the dull side,"I just find this whole cd uninspiring, theye been gone this long and give us a cd with maybye 3 or so ok tracks.I hope its the beginnning of a new run for this girls though...Ive missed them, i'm a fan from the begining and hope we all recieve soon a fresh new Wilson Phillips album full of their inspiring sounds and angelic voices."
2,We waited for this????,"I'm definitely a big fan of their earlier work, but I can't believe they let their fans wait ten years for THIS. An overproduced covers album? You've gotta be kidding me. Coming back to sing songs that you didn't even write is not exactly the best way to re-establish your musical relevance and artistic credibility. These three need to get back to the studio and actually CREATE an album, show they have something new to say, and then I'll consider it a comeback. This... this generic offering just shows that the girls can sing, which, thank you very much, I already knew. Very disappointed."
3,Well....,"Not much I can really say. The CD is an enoyable listening experience, but it's lacking what WP is actually about. WP was an icon in the early 90's and this CD just lacks the luster of the other albums they have done. Like Simon Cowell would say it's good. Not great just good. I hope this CD was just a taste of what is to come from these gorgous women. They are truely talented artists. Not much more to say. Would I buy it again after I listened to it? Probably....but.....I dunno, maybe I am just missing the whole effect. Will have to ponder."
1,An Utter Abomination!,"This is one of the worst CDs ever recorded. Their version of ""Go Your Own Way"" is a hideous puke-inducing abomination. It is the worst cover version of any song I've ever heard in 40 years. If Lindsay Buckingham allowed this, he must have been truly coked out at the time. I shall not try to find out, because if he did I would lose almost all respect for him. The rest of the covers on this disc are merely bad to mediocre. ""Go your own way"" is vile and loathsome. I will have to listen to Fleetwood Mac's version at least a hundred times to begin to wipe the revolting memories from my violated mind. Gotta run and hurl and retch now!"
2,Dissappointed,WP came out in 1990 and not the 1980's as other reviewers have listed. I am dissappointed with this album and I am really surprised that Columbia records didn't offer more feedback to the ladies on it. I would have rather had a WP album with all new songs.
1,Not again!,"Always a dis-pleasure to know that the daughters of 2nd rate, over the hill pop wash-outs are at it again. Michelle Phillips' claim to fame is she was lucky enough to have slept with the guy who actually wrote the songs that made her famous, and the alure of the Beach Boys went out when people who surfed their lives away in the 60's actually found something to do with their lives. And now her daughter wants to carry that tradition on. God rest the soul of John Phillips.Flying high on only their family names, this trio of wanna-be's have proven with their latest effort, that they can only record covers of previously successful material rather than try something original."
3,Hard to Dress,"My four year old fell in love with this set and we bought it. In its favor, the set is quite durable and will take lots of play. On the downside, the clothes are difficult to get on and off---even for an adult---and most of the play will be done by the parent removing and replacing clothes at the child's request."
3,"Nice idea, but...","The idea is good, and my daughter loves to ""play"" with them. But... The recommended age is 3?? The parts are tiny: my daughter got 4 of these for Christmas & has already lost several of the shoes & probably would have lost more of the items if I wasn't so anal about keeping them all together in a plastic baggie. Also, the rubber clothes are hard to put on & take off, even for an adult: I can't believe they would think a 3-yr-old could dress these things. The quality is so-so: typical made-in-China merchandise. Overall, I'd recommend this for an older girl who can keep track of all the small pieces & has the patience & manual dexterity it takes to dress & undress the dolls."
5,It's Awesome,My family and I love this game when we play it at our friends house and I am going to get one for home this Christmas!!!
2,What have we here?,"As I am reading this book, I'm going ""huh?"" and ""what does that mean?"" and ""this is like poetry, apparently..."" I can't say I liked the writing style (such as it is), but it did create word pictures and pulses inside me despite my desire not to like the book! It is a mood piece, at least to me. Not a writer I would buy again though. Sorry!"
1,Free Association At Its Worst,People that laud this type of 'work' are the type that can read something significant into anything because they don't want to admit that they don't get it. He tries to paint a picture of Gotham using mawkish free association which comes across as pseudo-intellect at its worst. I was really looking forward to this book because it sounded like a very cool exercise and interesting look into the greatest city on the planet. Hardbound pretentious excrement.
2,"MAYBE two-and-a-half stars, tops",".Pretty disappointing, IMO.I read this on a couple of back-to-back plane-flights, and... it just really LACKED something.One thing the potential buyer should know before buying is that this book, while all about the theatrical EXPERIENCE, doesn't actually talk about the viewed films much at all. Oh, there is the occasional complaint about 'modern cinema', etc etc etc, but there are no real reviews of the films in the book.Which would be fine, if the book was entertaining. Sadly, it just isn't. Oh, there is the odd interesting anecdote, and a funny moment or two. But it just doesn't hold the attention from chapter to chapter. In the end, the reader feels like s/he has been nagged-at for a few hundred pages.Given Murphy's role in MST3k, I'd expected more. Too much, perhaps."
2,Too much repetitive complaining,The fact that the author went to a movie everyday for a year is a complete gimmick to get you to buy this book which basically is 362 pages of him ranting about all the things he hates about going to the movies. Some stuff is genuinely funny but after a while you get sick of reading him complaining about these things (such as advertising) that really aren't that big of a deal. He hardly even talks about the movies themselves.
1,Unfunny and disappointing,"I am MSTie, I loved the show and the writing. So, when a writer for the show wrote a book about watching movies, of all things i expected a great book. Sadly i was wrong. Murphy goes on long rants about things that bug him, and does not review films much at all. His complaints become annoying after awhile, and the book, save for a few ancedotes is unfunny. He hates Kevin Costner, commercials, the high price of food, and exclusion of independent films from mainstream movie theaters. Since, as I said these complaints seem to be repeated well, a lot, the book becomes smug and self-righteous. If you want to laugh watch an episode of MST, or read the amazig colossal episode guide, both of which will give you many more laughs than this book."
2,Self-righteous and Indulgent,"Good God, is this book self-righteous. I bought it based on its compelling premise, and in return I received endless tirades on the inadequacies of movies, movie theatres, movie audiences, and every other topic that managed to crawl up Mr. Murphy's ... and opinions that Mr. Murphy has used to bore people at dinner parties for YEARS and now he's found an opportunity to share his ""wisdom"" and ""perfect"" taste to a wider audience. The one advantage we have is that we can stop reading (I did) whereas the friends and family of Mr. Murphy are still stuck listening to him complain, which is the #1 component of this book. The only thing that saves it from a one-star review is that there is some nice pro Laurel and Hardy propoganda, which means that Mr. Murphy got at least one thing right. Otherwise, it's a lot of self-satisfied griping."
2,A disappointment,"I had been looking forward to this book for a long time. As a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan, I hoped the idea of MST3K regular Kevin Murphy writing about the movie-going experience (he planned to see a movie every day) would be fun and entertaining. Murphy's book is neither.The major failure of the book is that Murphy's basic hook-- seeing a movie every day-- is unexplored. He breaks his movie going experience down week by week, starting with a list of the films he has seen duering the given week. However, he spends little time reviewing the films, instead, we get a week by week diary of how Murphy spent a (mostly)uninteresting 2001.The other problem is Murphy's tone. He comes off smug and self-satisfied, a tone that unfortunatly crept into the later years of MST3K (as well as into MST3K regular Mike Nelson's second book).A major disappointment."
2,"Nice idea, annoying book.","Being the film nut I am, I bought this book thinking that it looked like a really fun read. And it was: for about eighty pages. After that, I realized that I had gotten stuck in the quicksand of one man's midlife crisis. Kevin Murphy sounds more bitter than my great-aunt,and believe me, that is a hard thing to do. If you're excruciatingly bitter and don't mind 52 chapters of kvetching, go on ahead: this book may just be for you."
4,"Not all jokes, and suprisingly intelligent","Unlike the books written by Michael Nelson, this former MST3K writter's offering is more art than humor. He uses the seemingly silly stunt of seeing a movie eery day for a year as a way of talking about film in general. He shows us how theatre goers reflect society in genral, and how much the rise of megaplexes has taken away something of the specialness of seeing films.There are moments in this book where Kevin relats painful, personal stories about his exploits, and other moments when he uses this book as a pulpit to preach to us about our behavior as fans. At other moments, this becomes an interesting slice of history, chronicling what films were out in 2001, and which ones we should try and forget from that year."
4,Pleasant surprise.,"The first half of this book is a telling of the events that led up to the beginning of the Voyager series in more detail than we have seen them told before; the second half is a new DS9 story. Unlike in book one of this series, these two stories meshed well and formed one continuing story that actually works well. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this book, given that I had been significantly UN-impressed with book one of the series."
4,ok for a star trek book.,"The first two sections of the story were wonderful while the final 3rd one was readable even if it was a bit weak. While there are some interesting revelations a lot of the story was just rehashed from episodes of Voyager and DS9. I gave it four stars just because I am a hopeless sucker for star trek, but it is really not worth it."
3,OK if you're hanging out for a new Voyager book,I bought this for the Voyager novelette. The short and sweet length of the book makes for a quick read. I felt that some plot lines and character traits were invented especially for this book. Once again writers should know more about the characters before writing (we the viewers do). This is especially true when we are 6 seasons down the track with the characters. There's only so much backpeddling you can do. I've read better Voyager stuff but it beats staring out the window on a cold wet winters day. Enjoy (if you can).
3,Cloth Elbow Pads,"These are good products, except adult size is more for a small child. be aware of sizes if you order for an adult."
1,good and bad,These things fit my 115 pound wife fine. I'm a 240 pound man and had to cut holes in the elastic to make them semi-comfortable. I use them for computer elbow and the pad part is nice but it would be better if they had size options.
4,Great trip planning resource,"The only thing I would add to the previous review is that Sierra South does not have that big a selection of overnighters. Of the ones they do have, many are 9-ish miles in length (round trip) and I don't like to drive that far to do a couple hours of hiking. It is still a great book, though. Sierra North has more in the way of overnighters."
5,My key reference book to the southern Sierra,"Well researched and extremely well written, it is a wealth of accurate information for planning either partial day hikes or multiday backpacks. The single most reached for resource I use for the lower Sierra's trails. The description of the trail, fauna and flora to be expected enroute and access to trailheads are valuable and allows even the armchair hiker a good virtual experience. A companion guide to be used with this book would be a good topo map similar to perhaps those produced by Tom Harrison Maps."
5,Founding Fish,Excellent book by McPhee. A lot about fish and so much more. Good as an adjunct to a study of the Delaware River and Colonial times.
4,McPhee does it again!,"You can always count on a John McPhee book to be worth your time and money. He is an amazing author in his ability to extract interesting content from just about any topic. I am no Shad angler and this book doesn't make me want to be one, but I am a teacher of environmental policy and this book is one I have recommended to my students in both fisheries policy and water policy. There were large sections of the book I skipped because it seemed a bit over done, but that is a matter of taste. Probably if you are a dedicated angler you will find them interesting."
3,More than you wanted to know about shad,A masterful piece of writing. An amazing amout of detail and anecdotes about shad fishing. But probably more than any average person would want to know. But it's a joy just to read McFee's writing.
2,"Too much detail, too little McPhee","I was really excited to sit down with this, but I came away pretty unimpressed. This doesn't really match up to other classic McPhee writings. It's too focused on cataloging every mention of shad in American history, to the point of boredom. There are a few nice vignettes of shad fishermen and fish scientists, but they are brief, and they don't make up the narrative arc of the story as so many other McPhee writings do.If you're really into fish, you're going to like this. But unlike other McPhee books, it didn't draw me in when I wasn't interested in the subject. It's good writing, just not presented in an interesting way."
4,The Mark Twain of science,"John McPhee is the Mark Twain of rocks and scientists and fish. Like a Cartalk.com that covers all of natural science, McPhee takes you through skeleton of a fish, the nutritional history of our Revolution and more lovely fish stories than one could hear in a life time, all done in his private blend of intellect and folksiness.I am attracted by his love of the scientist, the multi-syllable word, and his ability to walk you through the human side of science while never feeling a strain on the line. I am hooked deeply by McPhee's ability to write, whether it is about the myth of George Washington being saved by the shad run, a fish rodeo in the gulf coast, an autopsy of a shad cleaning, the tides of the Bay of Fund or his tale of trying to land a fish on one side of the boat while shaking out a snake from his net on the other.More delicious and digestible (and shorter) than Annals of a Former World, this book is a keeper."
1,"Rambling, poorly written, dull and didactic","What a disappointment! What a mess. A few interesting tidbits here and there but mostly just poorly worded ramblings. I could do without the animal rights lecture also; it was fraught with the baseless anthropomorphisms so commonly tossed into the ring by those too lazy to actually do any research of their own. Furthermore, anyone who takes hours to land a 5 lb. fish has no right to claim any high ground on animal rights. Look in the mirror Mr. McPhee and you'll see someone who ""plays"" with his food!But really, it's the writing, or lack thereof, in this book that makes it one of the worst I have read in the past 20 years.Don't waste your time."
2,Boring Boring Boring....,"I listened to the audio cd version of this book - read by the author no less. And that's actually part of what made it so boring. He was so monotonous. I also thought that it read like a personal diary as oposed to an organized book. There didn't seem to be a structure to this book. There wasn't a story thread or thesis. Instead it all seemed like an aside or random thoughts about Shad fish thrown together. I""d just read the ""Cod"" book by Kurlansky - which was fabulous. So I guess I was expecting something of that caliber. One good thing was his description of the joy of fishing. I have to say that before I read this, I didn't understand why people would want to spend their time fishing. Now I at least I've gained an insight as to what makes fishermen tick."
2,Maybe McPhee is not so good a writer?,"Well, I hate to burst your bubble, because I like McPhee, but his latest effort seems to be trying to hit the sweet spot in the American public by using a sixth grade vocabulary. Also, the English language seems to be becoming more and more passive tense oriented and nounish in sentence structure (not unlike this sentence has become). Where is the active voice? That's why I like foreign languages better. You can write a sentence in Latin like: delendam esse Carthaginem (simple and direct).Anyhoo, like people who think high culture is going to Las Vegas, I doubt anybody agrees with what I have to say (there's that passive voice again)."
2,Disappointed,"I am a relatively new knitter, and I bought this book because I had heard good things about this designer. I did think that several items in the book were cute, but for the most part, the designs seemed overly complicated and hard to follow. I would probably not make sweaters as complex as the ones shown for myself, let alone for a small child that would only wear a sweater a handful of times."
2,Baby knits,"This is an early Debbie Bliss pattern book. I didn't like many of the patterns. They are too chunky for my taste. They have a ""dated"" look. I prefer her newer books that use thinner yarns with classic designs that look timeless."
4,CORONANDO IS GREAT PLACE TO LIVE.,I LIVE IN SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE BAY. ANY TIME SOMEONE COMES TO VISIT US WE TAKE THEM THERE.I WISH THERE WERE MORE TV SHOWS OR MOVIES MADE THER .
3,Was a bit disappointed.,"Bought as a gift for my husband, he did not really like the way this item worked. It did return the ball to you, although not always far enough (surface where you use this is important for how it works) & sometimes the return mechanism got stuck. Also, the putting mat was too narrow, and because it came folded in its box, it did not lay flat. The bumps affected the putt & directed the ball off the mat. I guess this could be used as a challenge, but overall my husband did not like this electric putting mat."
2,You get what you pay for.......,"Poor quality. Very basic, ball return doesn't work unless its on a very level surface. The ball return broke after 9 months. If you are a serious golfer or buying for one, pay more and get a better unit."
1,Do not consider purchasing this item,What a disappointment- my grandson opened Christmas Morning - when plugged in it started smoking. Obviously we were afraid to try to use further = ended up in the garbage. Package too big to take to UPS to return.
2,Lock Broke Within a Month,"I purchased this cabinet specifically because I wanted a _locking_ DVD cabinet, but the lock broke within a month. The cabinet is sturdy enough though, so screwing on a padlock seemed to work as a quick fix."
4,keepsake tin,"Daughter (4) is a huge Curious George fan so she enjoys carrying this around with ""goodies"" inside. Strong and cute. Might have to purchase the Curious George jack-in-a-box next."
4,Old fashioned lunchbox.,"My son takes this lunchbox to preschool with him. It is obviously a great find for the Curious George fan, but the lunchbox itself it a little flimsy. The metal can get warped or twisted fairly easily, and it takes some getting used to with the latch. Despite these, it holds up well enough for a 3 year old, and it gets a lot of attention!"
3,Metal lunch box,"The lunch box is cute but is made of very thin, flimsy, metal. We bent it right off. It is also difficult to close. The clasp doesn't want to close right."
3,Decent Lunchbox,I'm 30 and grew up reading Curious George. Since bicycles are my life and how I make a living I just had to have this. People are always commenting on how much they like this lunchbox. It dents easily but that's okay makes it look vintage!
4,good lunch box replica,"a tad small on the size of a ""typical"" lunchbox, but it works for a small child who doesn't eat too much."
3,OK. Will not buy again.,The top deformed and now very hard to open or close for a 3 year old at school.
3,Cute but flimsy,"It's a cute lunchbox. The figures are actually pushed out of the tin (like 3D) and it looks really cute. My 18 month old loves George and he likes it a lot carrying it around the house. It is pretty flimsy and cheaply made, I was hoping for something a bit sturdier but for the price.. not bad."
3,"Pretty, but flimsy","The box is really pretty, with its vintage style and its embossed scenes. The problem is that the metal is extremely thin, so the box gets deformed incredibly easy, and the paint job scratches in seconds. So, it is wonderful to look at, but not at all resistant."
4,For that classic lunch box look,"Its one of the best presents (i think) that I bought for another kid this past x-mas. Its a regular lunch box nothing missing, and it also, is great for collectors og either classic lunch boxes, or collectors of Curious George items."
2,marketed as a lunch box but it will not withstand daily use,"Cute, but not sturdy. Handle is exceedingly flimsy. Not a functional product and I would not advise purchase if you intend to use it, only if you want to look at it."
2,More decoration than useful,"While this is a cute tin box (and I used it to hold mini-muffins at at baby shower), it isn't meant to be used. Would look cute as a decoration in a baby's room or to hold all those crayon's for an older child."
1,Mercy Mercy On Me,"Have you ever read a book so boring and pointless that you wish you could get back the hours of your life that were wasted reading it. Well if you would like to share my experience read this book. When I pick up a biography on Marvin Gaye it should be just that-a biography. What I got from this book was Mr. Dyson's views on the problems in Black America right now. And was there a reason the afterword was mostly about R.Kelly? I know he was supposed to be comparing the struggle of sensuality v. spirituality that both men experienced but come on. R.Kelly doesn't have an ounce of the talent Marvin Gaye had. It's a shame to even make comparisons (at least on a professional/artistic level) of these two men. The book was boring, sloppy and I came away angry. After reading it my thought was 'Mercy Mercy On Me'."
4,Looking at a legend...,"in a new way. Creativity like Marvin Gaye's comes from many sources, especially when he had so many difficult relationships, with women, his family, and with himself.I found this book to be moving and insightful.I'd never really considered Gaye's influence on R, Kelly, either, although I'm not sure if I had that I would have considered at the length that Dyson does, but I do appreciate his willingness to forgive his subjects."
1,Worse than a root canal,"I thought the Publishers Weekly review was pretty accurate. This book read like a textbook. Maybe that is because Dyson is a college humanities professor. I could only get half way through before as Popeye said That's all I can stands, I can stands no more. Now I understand why I was able to purchase this book for 84 cents."
1,More about Dyson than Marvin,"Please do not waste your time on this book. It is more of an outlet for Michael Eric Dyson to express the effect of Marvin's music (as well as other artists) on Dyson. I really don't care about how a song makes Michael Eric Dyson feel. If the author could ever get past his own ego, it would be a lot more interesting."
1,ffff,this guy thinks he met tupac marvin and others but the guy just needs money and its sad he makes up alot of stories that even tupacs family says are not true.
4,Impressed and enlightened,"I finished in book in 6 days. I'm 21 years old, so its obvious Gaye was before my time. I didn't know too much about him besides some of his greatest hits, but this book did a great job of letting me know what was behind those, as well as other songs in his life. Dyson was able to tie together Gaye's sensuality and sprituality in a way that made it very interesting to read. I feel like I learned a lot about Marvin Gaye's work in this one book that I wouldn't be able to learn about him in other books written by other people."
2,Disappointment,"The reason I didn't care for this book may partially be my fault--I did not realize it was an essay instead of a biography. But the rest of the reason is on this author--this book was pretty much fact-based, reasons for songs were thrown out sporadically, Tammy Terrell's name was all over the place but the beatings were danced around (and one speaker even plugged her own book--why is that even in there?) and the author went on a history lesson through Motown with other artists. The organization was terrible, there was no set subject pattern, and it was a dry read. I ended up just skimming the book after page 20.And as big a fan as I am of R. Kelly, I did NOT want to read about HIM in a book with Marvin Gaye on the cover. It's like the author forgot who he was writing about through half the book; he starts talking about the Supremes, Gordy, R. Kelly, James Brown; stick to the man on the cover!"
2,I would have enjoyed this book more...,"...if it's depiction of the people in a small Montana were not all noble, wonderful people (except for the killers of course!), and it's depiction of all the environmentalists were not that they were all stupid, selfish people, who only want to save the wilderness so it would be their ""playground!"" The majority of cattle ranching in this country is controlled by huge mega-corporations, and they've been able to graze on Federal land where their cattle strip whole areas clean, and make it harder for the indigenous creatures to survive. I probably won't read any more of these mysteries. I enjoy a more balanced approach to my characters. And I'm only too glad to see more of this over-grazed land go back to National Parks."
2,very cheap,I bought this for my son at 22 months. The case is extremely cheap and had glue bits inside of it and he drill didnt work. My son kind of plays with parts of it but I really was surprised with the poor quality.
3,"Tool Set Not as ""Handy"" as expected...",Not as excited about this set as I thought I would be...he's already tired of it and the interior lining of the case fell out right away. Maybe he'll enjoy it more later on.
4,"Claiming Your Self Esteem: A Guide Out of Codependency, and Other Useless Habits","I found it very helpful. The book contains many practical steps to overcoming your past conditioning. It takes Albert Ellis' and Stephen Harpers' ideal that our thinking about events determines our emotional reactions (feelings} and gives the reader steps they can take to change their negative, life inhibiting behaviors. It was written for the layman in mind and for some may be very useful, for others it use in conjunction with CBT, (Cognitve Behavioral Therapy) would be ideal. I would recommend it for anyone looking to rid themselves of negative thinking about themselves"
4,a little gem,"Know Your Fats is a little gem that will be of interest to anyone seeking an understanding of the role that dietary fats play in human health and disease. Written in a succinct and jargon free style, Dr. Enig's book provides a comprehensive, yet understandable, overview of lipid biology, biochemistry and physiology. The book is literally crammed with attractive illustrations and useful tables that not only facilitate an understanding of the material covered, but serve as a source of information for future reference. Although written for the layman, the book will be of interest to scientists, physicians and health-care workers who seek a contemporary overview of this continually evolving field."
2,Not for the layperson,"Way too scientific for me. I will have work hard to weed out the simple info I wanted. And I very am disappointed that she recommends dairy, when we all know two things: the extreme toxicity of the antibiotics and artificial hormones (unless its organic) and the negative effect dairy has on the pH of the body. Also not happy to see any mention of Genetically Modified Organisms (Peanut, Cottonseed, Palm, Soy, Canola/Rapeseed and Corn oils) - this is a crucial factor in my food choices. If you are cooking with non-organic soy, corn, canola, or cottonseed oil, you are dipping into the highest genetically modified oils in the U.S. I'm trying to find data on peanuts, but again, buy Non-GMO peanuts and peanut oil to be safe. I suppose this book does follow it's title about fats. Too bad its so very narrow."
5,Excellent,An excellent resource with many interesting and informative facts. A good read or review for someone with a science background but may be somewhat challenging otherwise.
4,Laudable message,"As a fellow Asian-American, I was initially skeptical about this book. My fear was that it would perpetuate stereotypes about Asians -- but as I read further, the message is a refreshing one. Ethnicity aside, this book espouses something that many parents have forgotten: common sense. I think parents will be inspired by this book. It has confirmed my belief that success in school starts in the home."
5,extremely helpful book,In a day when so much emphasis is placed on the underachievers it's refreshing to me to read about what the high achievers are doing. Not only did the authors cover the high points of Asian parents' successes they also provided a chapter for their errors as well. I felt the book was helpful and clearly written. I disagree with the previous reviewers comments. I didn't see any back slapping here. Just a sincere effort to pass on a love of learning to others in an attitude of service.
2,Top of the Class: How Asian Parents Raise High Achievers,"I thought it was very poorly written. The authors claimed that one of the reasons that American children are not as successful in school as Asian children is because they are involved in too many extracurricular activities. While I agree that extracurricular activities should not cut into study time, I believe that there should be a balance. There are many American parents who have found this balance and their children are the ones that do well in school. I want my daughter to be successful, but I also want her to be happy."
3,Thoughts,"The story focused only on academic-cultivated Asian Family. Parents' involvement is important but kids need to learn ""life independence"" not only on academic works but also human society life as a whole."
2,How Androids Are Born,"While I'm sure that it's extremely necessary to raise a Harvard graduate, I still find it a little inhumane. What if a child doesn't want to go to Harvard? Why do parents feel the need to live vicariously through their kids? It's not a reflection of your parenting if your kid went to NYU or Oxford. Get over yourself and your fascistic insistence on perfection, even at the cost of the child turning into a depressed, utterly miserable human being who's too unhappy to form functional relationships. Oh, but yes, I forgot: at least he'll have a diploma from Yale hanging in his closet.Shame on you, people, for trying to shape your kids' lives according to your canon. Parental motivation is, of course, mandatory, but not to the point of a master-slave relationship. Ultimately, the kid will reap the fruit of your dictatorship, and ultimately, he will have to live that life. You will stop being a factor at about age twenty-five. Remember and cherish that fact."
1,WHAT IF I WANT TO BE A LOW PAID TEACHER?,I find this book full of fluff. It automatically assumes financial prestige is the focus of working hard in school and life. I have had plenty of Asians friends in school and in my neighborhood...few looked happy!If you believe that money will satisfy everything you are put on earth to do...then fall for this. If you see through that do not buy this book.If you want tips to aid in your childs school preformance many other books can help.
1,Poorly written,"I would co-sign all of the negative remarks about this book 100...wait...200%! Rather than reiterating what others have said, I will just say that I found it very confusing the way the author would refer to herself in the first and third person. I would have expected better writing, at the very least."
2,Poor Execution,"When I bought this book I was looking for a source of ""options"" that I could apply to the design of my own Smart House. This is more of a coffee table book, not a useful reference. For some unknown reason the editor chose to print the text as white print on a black background, which I find almost as annoying as reading text that is entirely bold-face. On top of that the author chose to showcase several houses that are starkly contemporary and amazingly ugly in my opinion. In sum: this book has nothing much to offer the prospective home builder."
2,Belongs on a coffee table,"I bought this book to get insight into the Smart home concept and implementation.This book has very little of hard knowledge, as far as smart homes are concerned. It does have a lot of picture, I agree with the other critics, IT MAKES A GOOD COFFEE TABLE BOOK.I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that actually wants to know about the smart home concept."
1,Photos,"As with everything else from this author, it is just a collection of pretty pictures, with absolutely no detail on materials and construction techniques."
2,Hmmm...I am not sure,"This book started out on a great premise, to talk about smart technology, smart materials and smart design in residential house. Examples illustrated in this book are not bad, either. Layouts are there, pictures are there. Descriptions are quite well-written. Still, this book is lacking of that wow factor that manages to captivate our interest, or perhaps, to keep us reading from beginning till end. Perhaps, it is the quality or the presentation of this book. It is printed in Hong Kong and compared with books done by Taschen and Phaidon, this book is definitely of a more inferior quality. My conclusion is simply, hmmm...I'm not sure. Keep up the good work, though."
3,"pretty pictures, low executable value","I am in the process, prolonged process, of building a house and wanted some pointers, some good ideas. I got them in pictures but not in details. For instance one of my favorite houses, Sund Olsen's Courtyard House is here in page after page of photos. Great but not one detail about what the specs are on all that glazing, what the R value is of the roof. The books also really slants to West Coast environments and doesn't bring a lot of relevance to the South (not that the South necessarily has a lot of relevance)."
3,"Big and bulky, screw housing stick out too far","This thing is much bigger than I thought it would be. I used this item on my heel shifter. The allen screw housings project out from the top and bottom cover, which sandwich your old brake pedal, and, at least in my case when installing it on a 2002 Kaw Vulcan 1500 Nomad, the screw housing won't allow the shifter to go below the edge of the floorboard which now has a Kuryakyn floorboard cover. I liked the way my heel shifter was pretty low, but now with this pedal cover installed I had to adjust the heel shifter arm up one notch on the spline and now it rides much higher than I was used to. I screwed up a lot of my shifts at first but I'm getting used to it. If I find another solution that would allow me to go back to my old setup I would ditch this one."
5,Kuryakyn Break Lever Peg,This peg fits perfectly my Honda Shadow Aero 2012. They are of excellent quality and beautiful look. I took less then 5 minutes to fit. I only needed my allen key set.
2,Not the best option.,"Pro's:+Easy to setup, only took 2 minutes.+Compact sizeCon's:-Poor picture quality.-Very poor sound.-Interference from everything - even after diabling the wireless network, unplugging the cordless phones, and shutting off the baby monitor, we still had a jumping lines and static.If you live in a remote area without neighbors, have no microwave, cordless phone, or wireless network, then this is the camera for you; otherwise, search elsewhere."
1,Night Hawk Wireless Camera,I bought this Swann Night Hawk Wireless Camera with Night Vision yesterday because it advertised a 300' range. Boy was I disappointed. From the kitchen to the livingroom approx. 20' it would not work. It won't work through walls and has to be LOS (line of sight). But even in the same room it only had a range of about 16 feet. It's a fine LOOKING system but looks mean nothing when you want security. I'm taking it back today. Don't waste your money on this junk. I gave it a one star for looks only.
1,"No range, poor image","I bought this hoping to go about 15 feet through only one wall and capture security images on my PC. The wireless range is within the same room only! Going through a single wall cause fuzzing out, and there was this line that constantly scanned from top to bottom. I tried various settings, then gave up and took it to another room. Yet the problem remains. Yes, it could have been my Wi-Fi router, but if the mere presence of a Wi-Fi system (either my own or a neighbor's) is going to cause interference, and ruin the image then forget it!Also, the image is extremely poor in color (day mode). I'm not picky for small camera images since you can't expect much in this size and price range. But wow, it's really bad; worse than those super cheap webcams of five years ago. I'm talking almost no discernable color whatsoever, and poor definition at that!The product is going back tomorrow!"
3,Not a bad system,"Nice system. The cameras are small enough not to be noticed. Be warned that the ""battery operation"" of the camera is for testing only. The manual states that the cameras are not designed to work long term on the battery (9 Volt). The power cable supplied is size ""h"" and not terribly long. Be sure to consider where you can run power from when you install. Also, the Swan AV/power cords sold through Amazon are not compatible. This is a major headache if you do not plan for it. Finally, here in Florida, we have concrete walls. This limits the working range to about 30- 40 feet. Overall the cameras are nice but for my particular situation they are not up to the job."
1,Horrible range,You are only able to receive decent image quality if the wireless receiver is right next to the camera itself. It defeats the whole purpose of being wireless. I have mine set up only 15-20 feet away and all I get is a shaky screen. Stick with wired cameras instead.
2,"Swann SW233-WO2 - good picture, but blocks WiFi network","Was looking for a security camera to watch between the side of the house and the side street. First tried these cameras inside the window - daytime was fine, nighttime all you could see was glare in the window from the LEDs. Tried one outside, and it worked fine...for one night. Went to start the VCR it was hooked to the second night and there was no picture from the camera. Replaced it with the second camera, which worked for two nights, then stopped. It was October and low temp might have gotten to 45 degrees, well within the range in the specifications. I tried the receiver at about 40 feet from teh camera, picture was good, just a little interference. When receiver was closer (about 10 feet) picture very good. The other issue was it totatlly blocked my WiFi network, could not connect from my laptop. So, returned the set.Pros: good picture, when camera worksCons: outside doesn't last more than two days, totally blocks WiFi."
4,"Not as good as a wired camera, but easy to set up.","Easy to set up, this system can mess up your wirless local area network (wlan) if you have it on the wrong chanel. Concrete and steel mess up the reception, so if you live in a concrete and steel house don't expect great reception. It works best within line of sight. Over all, I kept it."
1,Rj11 not recommended,This coupling would not work luckily I found one from manufactuer and was able to finish the project. Do not recommend you buy this product. If you can get one straight from revo America and pay a little more I would.
5,Interesting and informative,This was one of the few college textbooks that I actually enjoyed reading. I found the information to be very helpful for my tests as well as in the outside world. It is written in an easy to read format which helps one to grasp the more difficult concepts. The case studies that are included in each chapter help in understanding the disorders as well as help the reader know what people experience with these disorders. I would reccomend this book to anyone (even non college students) who want to know more about abnormal psychology.
5,Good Condition,The book was new just as it said and appeared to have been handled well in the shipping. Arrived on time. No problems.
1,A poorly edited and schizophrenic organization style,The ONLY reason you should ever buy this book is if it's a required text book.
5,Love it or hate it,"This is my favorite Jazz fusion album of all time. You either love it or hate it. It is so far from the typical smooth jazz fare that it can throw of some listeners. However, this is exactly what I am looking for in my music. An artist who dares to be different, but at the same time an artist that is skilled at what they do. Praful's sax playing skills are off the chart. Check out the piece ""Teardrop Butterfly."" Amazing!!"
1,Praful = Awful,"Just as most other customers did, I ordered this CD after hearing ""Sigh"" on the radio. I found out that the radio station had edited out the parts without the drum beats. The piece as edited on the CD didn't flow at all.Worse, I didn't like any of the other pieces at all. This is not an album that I can listen to comfortably."
2,Time takes its toll on even the greatest.,"I was a Heinlein fan all throughout my formative years andinto adulthood. Thought provoking books like ""Stranger in aStrange Land"" and rousing good yarns like ""Glory Road""made growing up in the 60's bearable. With such a greattrack record, I eagerly awaited the release of ""Number ofthe Beast"" when it was originally published. At first, Iwas enthralled. Up to page 100 or so, the book was riveting,a real page turner reminiscent of ""Glory Road"".Unfortunately, the book totally changed at then. It wasalmost like another author had taken over. The book rambledfor the next 600 pages on a totally different track andnever resolved the original plot. I suspected that Heinleinwas feeling the first stages of senility. It was a realdisappointment; particularly given his former greatness.Later works (e.g., Friday) were better, but the greatness ofthe early works never returned."
1,Heinlein was in his dotage...,"The first sci-fi I ever read was Heinlein's _Have Space Suit Will Travel_, it hooked me as a Heinlein fan for life. When _Number..._ hit the shelves I was delighted--what could be better than another Heinlein? To say I was disappointed would be gross an understatement. The fine sense of alternate reality, the wit and the sarcasm of the Heinlein I loved was all missing from _Number_. What this books seems to show us is an aging writer badly stretching his credibility to write a final cumulative volume wherein all his characters in all his novels get a final chance to meet each other. Sappy, trite and not worth it. The ""continuity editors"" were sleeping through this one and it, sadly, must have made it into print on the author's name alone. If you love Heinlein, don't sully your memories of him by reading this one."
2,Super Reader,"Marginally better than Friday. Although that is not saying a lot. I bought this at a second hand bookshop discovered while camping by the beach as a teenager. Luckily, there were plenty of other distractions of various types, as if this was the only entertainment things would have been very bad indeed on that holiday."
3,I love reading Heinlein,"I really enjoyed the alternative lifestyle concepts implied by the characters in this book. All of the conversation did make reading a burden at times, and hard to follow alot of the time, but the story was interesting and the characters were great! I really look foward to reading more Heinlein in the future."
3,Where Heinlein Started Going Wrong,"I am a tremendous fan of classic Heinlein like the Past Through Tomorrow and Stranger in a Strage Land. However, his work begins to go down hill with his effort to unify all of his characters into a single storyline, mainly it would seem so that they can have sex with each other.The idea itself, that every new universe imagined actaully comes into existance, is intersting. The execution is torturous. The characters are flat and smell vaguely of James Bond. The image of flying around in the sports car turned dimensional transporter looses its luster as soon as you realize the Heinlein expects it to be taken seriously. Even the appearence of Lazurus Long, my favorite Heinlein character, cannot save this shaggy dog story."
3,Sort of like going to a party..,"But none of your friends are acting quite right. I won't say it's not fun, but it's a little off of the master plan. It gets even weaker at the end, where quite honestly, I was waiting for the author to personally drop in and start shagging the guests. Sssself indulgence...."
1,Boring.,"I think The Number of the Beast is boring, confusing and the worst novel I have ever read from Heinlein. The characters talk, and talk, and talk, and talk ALL the time and nothing really happens. Also there are a lot of references to other novels from Heinlein so if you haven't read them before you are absolutely lost. Also there are jokes that I thought, have been very funny for Heinlein himself and his friends, but only for them. There is also some like a ""revolutionary"" concept of sexual liberty like in Stranger in a Strange Land, but only a shadow of that, something really absurd because it seem to be written on pourpose to be ""revolutionary"" and failing in the attempt. I have to make a effort to finish it, and also I got lost at the end. As a final remark also the ""science"" on the storty are not speculative (as its supposed to be in sci-fi) but absurd."
5,Number not for beginners,"N O B is full af allegories and references to other novels in the sci fi genre you may be lost or confused while reading this book, unless, your a serious sci fi reader. Try some of Heiliens other books first I suggest leaving NOB for last although it is an exxcellent book ranked right next to Stranger In A Strange Land. In my humble opinion."
2,Disappointing,"Having read Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"", I was expecting to enjoy this book. However, I found it to be a tiring read, with the plot obscured by silly banter among the four main oversexed characters, who play at being heroes and heroines from old SF magazines. They wander through universes wielding sabers and calling Mars ""Barsoom"". In between their capers, they decide that Russians are xenophobic with Communism or without, and that a ranger who is unfriendly must be an alien. Reading this book (and being a science fiction fan, mind you), I began to understand why so many people cringe at the very name of science fiction."
1,Dismal book. Don't read it.,In general I'm a Heinlein fan. I had this book floating around in my attic for years. I recall reading it way back in my teenage years and liking it so I thought to give it a try again. What a pointless waste of time. It lost me about a third of the way through. I tried to stay with it for another third and then gave up.Don't read it.You won't like it.
4,A great novel from the Great,"This was the first work I read ( in an italian translation, then I read it in english and I think that from now on translators can put their work in trash bins ) from mr. Heinlein and, wow!, I found my writer!!Even if I think that this is not the most important work of the master, I really enjoied the reading of this novel.His great capability to speak about everyday life using Sci-Fi ambient and people is great.Finally I just want to say:Stranger in a strange land must be studied in schools!!!! All across the world!!!"
5,I found THE book I have been looking for after 10 years!,"I've read a Dutch translation about 10-12 years ago from the local library, and have been wanting to read it again ever since, however I couldn't find it again (library closed). After a long long time... I received Amazon's URL from a friend and after 1 search try, I FOUND IT!!! I am a great fan of this book (Despite the fact that I have read multiple books about inter-world-navigation - and much sh.t has been written on that issue, believe me!). Well, I'm a Dutchman (not flying) so I do not give away any 10's when rating something, but it definitely earns a 9! It's a consistent book that leaves just enough (or too much?) to the imagination of the reader. OK, a little bit of nude wandering in strange worlds seems a bit overdone, but hey - it's a strange world"
5,Transport Yourself to New Realities,"I rarely reread books, but I have The Number of the Beast in three different editions (including an illustrated version), and have read the book several times in my life. The book allows readers to mystically transport themselves, becoming part of an awesome adventure that starts at a California party. The book's tremendous strengths are its characters, dialog, and ideas.(Heinlein makes occasional references to other science fiction characters. For example, Deja Thoris is a princess of Mars in an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel.) Although the Number of the Beast diffuses a bit toward the end, I consider it the best of Heinlein's books and hope to be reading it and rereading it until I die. Lose yourself in it. Become immersed in it. Fly with it.The book deals with parallel universes and other dimensions, subjects also treated with great creativity by Cliff Pickover in his book ""Surfing Through Hyperspace."" Get either book, and learn to soar."
1,Bizarro Heinlein?,"I have a new theory on why this book is so disappointing. What if it wasn't really written by the same R.A. Heinlein who wrote the truly impressive ""The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress"" and so many other classics? I think it was written by an imposter from another dimension.Seriously, this novel exemplifies all the weaknesses that Heinlein's detractors love to point out. Without going into the gory details, I'd just suggest that anyone working his or her way through Heinlein's books leave this one for dead last, or skip it altogether."
2,I couldn't even finish it.,"I ~love~ Heinlein. I couldn't make it though this one, it was so revolting. The book was okay until it turned into a mastubatory fantasy for Heinlein... I dont object to sexual content in and of itself, but it came across like I was reading a novelation of a sci-fi soft porn flick rather than a legitimate sci-fi novel. I might go back and try and read it pretending it's an author other than Heinlein reading it. Maybe it won't be so bad then."
2,Not the best,"Like most of the other reviewers, this book starts great, has some great moments, but has some of the most dullest, boring, RAH I have ever read.While bad RAH is often better than good other authors, if you enjoyed The Number of the Beast, you have some great reading ahead of you with his other works.Still would not mind having a ""Gay Deceiver"" myself,... even in its standard form"
3,Omni knew what it was doing,"When Omni printed the first part of this book back in `79, it skimmed the cream from the top. It wisely left off with the words ""On to Barsoom!""I ran (not walked) to the bookstore, purchased it, and began voraciously reading. What I discovered was that Heinlein's genius ran out about the time that our foursome headed for Mars.I *was* intrigued with the alternate dimension where ""evening"" was practiced. The drunk driver who caused the amputation of a victim's leg was forced to have a car run over HIS leg, sit for as long as his victim had to (before help arrived), and then have his own leg removed. Heinlein called this ""chilling."" I'm not sure that I agree.The concept that alternative universes were mentioned in the book of Revelation was Heinleinishly good, too. However, like much of his later work, this book was just too darned long. Half this size, it might have held up."
4,A fun peice of RAH fluff,"IF you only love his earlier, hardcore, sci-fi, you will , as so many others have absolutly HATE this book.But if your looking for a light, easy reading, fun book, with references to most of the greats of sci-fi and children's literature you'll enjoy this book. Have you read Asimov, Baum, Swift, Burroughs? Have you read Time Enough for Love, Moon is a Harsh Mistress, The Cat Who Wlaks through Walls? If yes, than give this book a try. If not, don't bother, you'll probably hate it too."
5,Heinlein's best adventure,"Heinlein has written a lot of books, and I have enjoyed every one that I have read. But for pure adventure and humor, this is his most adventurous, comical book ever."
3,Heinlein at his weirdest?,"Okay! Heinlein is a great author, with such books as Door into Summer, and Stranger in a Strange Land, but this book just got a little too weird for me. While some of his stories had a lot of free love going on, this one didn't use it to make the story better. I finished the book, but the ending just made the story weirder. I will continue to read Heinlein until I've finished everything by him, but this story was just a disappointment. The stories I thought would be dull (Sixth Column, Job!)were actually interesting, and most of the ones I thought would be interesting were very much so. I would suggest this book only if you are really into Heinlein, but not as your first taste of him."
1,the first book for 2 years I really hated,"Usually, I try to finish a book. But this time, I could not. At the moment I wanted to kill the 4 main characters because they had been talking for approximately 6 pages, I put it away (I did not throw it away because it was from the libray). I just could not stand it anymore. As some of the reviews tell me, there seems to be story somewhere behind page 150. But I can not believe that anything interesting happens in that book. Perhaps that is not true; I will never know, because I will never even try to read it again."
2,Not my favorite Heinlein,"I dont have anything bad to say about Heilein - out of respect.He made a living writing, I just read whatever there is by him.This just wasnt much to my liking.I have read the re-interpretations trying to say this was meant to mean certain things.I dont really buy it, so let's just say, if you aren't compelled to read EVERYTHING Heinlein, you can probly give this one a pass."
2,This was one book I couldn't finish.,"I plodded through this story for 500 pages until I was finally repulsed by the constant attempts by Heinlein to push the envelope and be as outrageous as possible. What finally got me was the incest. I really enjoyed some of his earlier works like Starship Troopers and The Sixth Column, and I wanted to collect and eventually read all of his titles. This one was starting to get a little confusing for me but I put up with it until RAH started going off the deep end with the breaking of taboos. Maybe it was over my head since I'm a new reader of Sci Fi, but I just reached a point where I wasn't interested in the story anymore."
1,This is one of the worst books I've ever read,"I have read and enjoyed a number of other Heinlen books. However, there was something about this book that struck me wrong. The charachters are poorly drawn; all are classic ubermensh. The plot drags on and goes nowhere. The whole story seems to revolve around the charachters value system and their constant bickering over their minute differences with one another. Much of it comes across as Heinlen preaching once again about the benefits of nudism and open relationships. If you are looking for a not too subtle conflict of the sexes veiled in flowerchild philosophy, this may be the book for you. However, if your looking for more thought provoking entertainment that actually has a plot, look elsewhere. I could barely get through this book. I was extremely disapointed with an otherwise noteworthy author."
4,Dahl-icious,"Too bad Dahl's short story collections are so hard to find; he was one of the best, right up there with Saki and O. Henry. This early collection has a few really delicious tales, particularly ""Parson's Pleasure"" and ""The Landlady,"" and one about a baby that gets fed some sort of special food and gradually turns into a giant bee -- just the kind of thing only Dahl could pull off. This collection is worth tracking down, especially if you are a Dahl fan."
3,Good,"There's a quiet zaniness that runs through the lot of these stories. Most of them are crisp, surprising and smoothly written at every turn. ""The Way up to Heaven,"" ""Parson's Pleasure,"" ""Genesis and Catastrophe"" and ""Pig"" delivered the best twists and overall fun for my tastes. Great literary and psychological foreplay."
1,Artificial iced tea,"So the two pack seemed like a good value which it is but the iced tea didn't taste like iced tea. I don't understand why they find a need to put artificial color in the mix and several other preservatives. I wish the mix simply had tea, real sugar and natural lemon flavor."
1,Tea? Maybe,"I order this item two times on this subscribe and save and both times I had to throw it out. The Tea arrived damaged the bottom of the items were broken and tea was coming out of it. They cannot do a good job of packing items at this company. and, The oz(s) ain't no 74.2 it is less then that ."
5,sounds like a party,these dudes were mind blowing and this lp put them on top! amazing musicians and a super fun era!! rock on nektar we love you!! go on tour in 2010 i really think you would do a brisk and robust business. i would like ta be your promoter for these gigs........
3,"Not a bad book, but not great either.","This is the book I bought when I wanted to learn to play the tenor banjo. I got it mainly because it was the cheapest book they had. Not my smartest move. In its defense, the book is not bad: there is a nice section in the back with chord diagrams, and the songs are for the most part old familiar tunes, so you'll know if you're playing them right, and it does give you a good introduction to the instrument. The problem is that the book is pretty thin, everything is in notation...no tablature (not that you'll need it, but still), and it doesn't really show you any advanced techniques, which I found in other books. I outgrew this book VERY quickly, after a week and a half, I was playing everything in the book and ready for more...but it wasn't there. If you have previous music experience (and who takes up tenor banjo as a first instrument?) You won't get too much out of the book. Go for something else with more substance."
4,Mac users,"This phone's bluetooth will work with Tiger's iSync 2.3 and Address Book with the addition of a ""feisar"" plug in via the net for about $3. The 300i is not on the compatibility list at apple dot com as of my purchase time of Dec 06. -- In general I agree with some of the other reviews: The interface is not as simple to use as Nokia's, the oddly overlapping buttons are small, the battery time is pretty good (4 x 24 hours with 2 hours of talk time and it's at 40%), it has a nice form factor, good reception, good audibility, and no major problems with Cingular calls in Philly for me. Cingular's customer service has also been okay; I'm a long time subscriber under the former AT&T; network Cingular is trying to phase out. I like the FM radio feature and think the music and camera features are less well conceived."
2,Software bugs render phone near useless,"I am on my second w300i fron Cingular/AT&T and about to be a third. This phone just up and shuts itself off 2 - 3 times a day. Thought it was me at first, until I tested it for 2 days, 12 hours a day. Left it undisturbed on my desk, checking it every hour. At least twice a day it would be off. Buggy software. Missing too many important calls. Not a good phone."
1,Sony Ericsson W300i,"First off I do not have AT&T so this has nothing to do with their service. I am on my 2nd W300i, both of them have started shutting off. The first one would shut off mid phone call, and just randomly at other times of the day. The 2nd one hasn't shut off during calls yet but still shuts off constantly. I had to turn it back on about 15 times today which is ridiculous in my opinion. I got this phone originally almost a year ago and had to get a replacement after about 6 months because of the problems. The 2nd one has also lasted about 6 months before I got really frustrated. The problems have been really bad for about a month. I previously had a motorola that the microphone broke on so I was excited to get a more reliable phone but I am very disappointed with my purchase so far. I hope other people have better luck with this phone."
4,Included accessories,"Cingular repackages the phones in their own box, so what's printed in the Sony Ericsson manual may not match what's in the box. There's actually a list of the contents on one end of the box. I also purchased a w810i, and while the phones are similar in function, it also came with a 128MB Memory Stick Duo, USB cable, and software. So the w810i turned out to be a better deal if you like the candy bar form versus the clamshell.Also, the AC adapter included is the standard model. There is another model of AC adapter that allows you to charge the phone and plug in the headphones or other accessories. Or you would have to buy the docking station or a charging station. So either you end up with a stack of connectors or a jumble of cables. The new connector seems to be a bit more robust than the previous design on my old T637, but less practical in real use.Otherwise it is a terrific little phone."
2,not very robust,"I bought 2 of these, one for each child. within a year neither were functional one dead, one the callee can not hear the caller. The hinge does not stand up to the abuse that teens and pre-teen can dish out and gets precariously loose in short order. Previous motorola v180 and 220 phones are still functional (three years later) if the worse for wear. Have other sony rotating phone that is workhorse, but these, not so much."
3,Not very user friendly,"The phone has a lot of cool features I have not seen in other phones but it is quite complicated to figure out the basic features such as how to send your call and end it. My other phone had a ""send"" and an ""end"" button in this phone you actually have to read the screen that prompts you to push a key to do all of that.It runs out of charge very quickly compared to other phones.You have to have their specific headset to use with the phone. The common headsets you find in the store that fit all other phones will not fit this one.As for dealing with Cingular: The costumer service is good but they are only available till 9pm. Also if anyone leaves you a message before you set up your voicemail those messages will get deleted and you cannot recover them, and so make sure you set your voicemail first."
3,I don't Love this phone,"I've had this phone for approximately 6 months and while it has some very nice features, overall I just don't love it. The MP3 player is great, I'll give it that. It's nice to not have an extra MP3 device to carry around. The battery longevity is very good.Otherwise... I find the menu system to be a bit cumbersome (trying to turn the speaker on and off while on a call requires multiple button pushes which is a nuisance). The proprietary connector is annoying. The camera is very poor. The MP3 software for your computer is mediocre. And after 6 months two of the four directions on the navigation button have stopped working.This phone has so much potential; I just think it needs a bit more work to make it better than average.ADDITION: the volume button has died as has the head phone connection. This phone is poor."
3,Can you hear it now?,"Aside from my agreeing with some of the other reviewers who complained about navigating through this phone, my biggest complaint is that the volume level of the phone is take-it-or-leave-it. Neither the phone, nor the much-touted MP3 playing aspect has ANY ADJUSTABLE VOLUME WHATSOEVER. In fact, I chuckled at the reviewer who claims the speaker system sounds like a transistor radio. Speaker system? And if the ambient sound is loud, you can forget about hearing your music through the headphones.The camera is what it is: a phone camera.The phone has great reception.But you'd better not plan on calling out from a crowd. Again, there is no adjustable volume on this phone/MP3 player. Have you ever heard of such a thing?"
1,Great phone but not buying it,This is good phone but you have to use Sony only over priced memory stick micro. I recently got a 1Gb microSD card as it is supported by all other phone but can't use that with this phone.
2,Sony should make a Sports Model,"I liked this phone because it was small and got very good reception with Cingular/AT&T; service just about anywhere I went.The screen is clear, but small and the letters are pretty tiny.The buttons are a little difficult for my father-in-law to manipulate because they're quite small and kind of overlap each other.To use the FM radio, you have to attach the hands-free device which is kind of a bummer. I really don't want to carry anything else with me.My brief 1.5 months of owning this phone came to an abrupt end when I accidentally went swimming with it in my pocket. I probably spent a minute or less in the water, but it killed the phone.I've had several other friends wash their phones in their pants and it seems like 50% of them survive. And you'd think this wouldn't have been as bad spending 30 minutes churning around in a washing machine. But a quick dip in a river ruined it.Sony should make a Sports version."
5,Awesome Phone,"Ok, I am going to write a very short review and hopefully update it at a later point to give you more details.I got this phone on Friday and fell in love with it right away. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use. I have tested the camera, the FM tuner, the MP3 player, the phone itself, the bluetooth and have had no issues. The phone has a very nice feel and look - surprisingly, it is both ""cute"" from a woman's perspective while ""rugged"" from a guy's viewpoint. The rugged look comes from the black color primarily while the cute part comes from the internal features.All in all, both me and my wife LOVE the phone. It is better than my RAZR too."
4,Good basic phone,"Ok, I'm one for simplicity. I don't need the mp3 playing ability, camera, etc, but one cannot find a phone without the extras, sooooo......The sound quality is good. I've had a few complaints about background noisy when I'm on the road, but not so bad that its impossible to hear.The speakerphone is poor, bad, crap. I really need to use the speakerphone, but just can't do it with this phone. Its not loud enough and can be scratchy.The ringer can be set to nice and loud. It even gives you a little warning about hearing loss when you max out the ringer.I love it that it is light and easy to hold. The buttons are easy enough for me. Screen is clear.It does get good FM reception and sounds pretty good if you are into that."
4,"Finally, a replacement for my portable CD Player/Radio","I've been getting tired of carrying around my portable CD player/ radio, but I love it because I can listen to the radio if I want. But 12 songs, and repetitive radio stations is not the way to travel sometimes, especially on long journeys. I was starting to feel left out not having a music player that fits in my pocket. Then I found this sony walkman phone. It's a phone, an mp3 player, AND a radio. I'm glad Sony Ericsson hasn't forgotten about people who still listen to the radio. And the headphone have great base- which most don't when you listen to the radio. I was very surprised, because they look so small.The only thing I don't like is having to buy the USB cable seperately. I can't enjoy the mp3 feature without it."
3,sim card,The sim card is weary hard to remove. I don't know why sony ericsson did that with their phone.The phone futures are great and work well.
3,be careful if you have a toddler,first it is easy to use and the sound is great but my toddler is teething and put it in his mouth for about 3 seconds i grabbed it but the phone is dead. i have a nokia that he dropped in the pool it was in there for at least a minute before we could fish it out and it works perfectly. and as far as at&t i got the phone in the beginning of July and still dont have the data cable for it and it is broken now so what is the point.... they said they would take the activation fee off because the data cable still didnt come but that was not removed. i dont think we will be renewing our contract with at&t after this time....
4,Excellent Service,"The first shipment I received, the bottles were 2/3 empty. I reported it to Ace and they kindly replaced them. Evidentally, they are not normally full due to shrinkage? Anyways this stuff really works well. I can not find it here in the stores so have to order it. One dose and no more ants!"
2,Framingham boredom,"The book describes the large and very important Framingham study, that has provided much of the detailed knowledge we now have about the connection between lifestyle and heart and circulatory disease.The topic itself is an interesting one. The results of the study are so ingrained in everyday knowledge that most people are not aware that there is actually a source of this information. But there was a time where the connection between bacon and heart attacks came as a complete surprise.Unfortunately, this book is very poorly written, and does not do the topic justice. Most chapters consist of endless namedropping and neverending tales of internal battles in the administration of the study. Only a very small part of the book deals with the study, its results, and the further implications."
1,way to big,"these must have been seconds ,the sizes were so huge it looked like a table cloth , buying clothes on line is such a waste of money."
1,Not the same quality,The sweatshirts I received all had obvious flaws that were noticeable right from the package. Also I have purchased this same brand and style from other web sites and the XL fit me. All three of these were to big.They appear to not be the same quality
2,Had High Hopes,"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter after reading the positive reviews. Sadly, within a few hours of having this cash register, the drawer would not stay closed. We try to close it, and it latches for a couple of seconds, then springs open on its own. If we had been more proactive, we would have returned this for another brand."
4,Learning,"I bought this for a child having a problem remembering the denomination of change, but all of my grandchildren enjoy playing with it"
5,Great register,I bought this cash register for my nephew and he loved it. It is exactly what I expected. It is cute and durable.
5,Fun Cash Register,"We purchased this for our son and daughter (4 & 2) for Christmas. So far we are loving it!! I seems quite durable, looks realistic and most importantly...requires no batteries!!! Its solar powered which is awesome since our kids are too little to remember to shut anything off! Its a bit old for the 2 year old, but she tries anyway. I'd recommend buying extra money though b/c I anticipate it disappearing in the toy box quickly! Great toy and a great price."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this cash register around Christmas for my daughter and it stopped working in October. When I called the manufacturing company, I was informed that they do not repair or replace items over a year old. Well it appears that the life cycle of this item is about one year and because of my bad experience, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Breaks fast!,"I'm so disappointed, because my daughter got this for christmas, only used it for a month, and it broke. And I can't return it anymore due to it being too late. But, really a fun toy. Solar powered calculator was awesome while it lasted. The drawer still opens on it, but the calculator part broke so soon. Oh well, win some you lose some. Amazon is always such a good company."
5,Excellent toy,"Purchased for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter - best $35 I ever spent! She plays ""store"" all day long with it. Only design flaw is that the cash drawer shoots out at a mile a minute, spilling the change. But she's learned to hold it with her hand and all's well. Highly recommended."
3,Not entirely realistic...,"While I appreciate the fact that this cash register takes cash and credit cards, I think it's missing a major feature. There are a lot (A LOT!) of people out there on Food Stamps and other assistance. This item needs to account for that by having a feature on it that scans EBT and SNAP cards and alerts the customer of her remaining balance and whether or not her purchases qualify (like no cigs, dog food, deli items, etc. for instance). Every time I'm in the store, I have the food stamp users in front of me, so I think this toy needs to run the full spectrum of possible checker scenarios in order to be considered ""realistic and educational"". I was going to call the manufacturer to suggest this but my Obama phone doesn't have any minutes left on it this month."
2,Startling to kids and dangerous,"Although I like the layout of this toy, my grandchild won't play with it. That's because the first time he pushed the open button, the drawer shot out with a loud whoosh and hit him in the stomach (it was on a table). If he would have been shorter, it would have hit him in the face. The drawer is on some kind of intense spring-loaded system, and shoots out with force. Might be OK for older kids, with a warning of what's going to happen. But it's dangerous for 3 year olds and under."
1,Didnt get what I ordered,I ordered this toy NEW for my sons birthday. Them item came very used and drew on with another kids name. I sent it back approx. 4 weeks ago and still have not seen my money back.
3,"Durable, works great..smells","This is a very good cash register and it is durable but I noticed after a time that the money smelled like poop, I think it has something to do with the electronics in the register, I've tried putting dryer sheets in the drawer but than it just smelled like downey poops, I've cleaned it too but nothing seems to work. And no my son didn't do anything to cause this odor. Finally I threw the money away and bought him the McDonald register which came with food, a headset, and McDonalds visor, he plays with this much more than the old one and it works just as good. I also purchased a jar of money that I think Amazon sells, it's cash, change and a check book w/ pen, very cute."
4,A good choice,"I purchased this for a mixed age home child care. The two year old girls like it because it makes noise when they press the buttons and the drawer shoots out. I had to remove the money, though they weren't eating it, because they chose to throw it all over the room. The credit cards got to stay thought. I like that it's solar powered and it is built strong enough to handle the daily wear and tear for years to come."
2,doesn't work,"I ordered one of these for my son's fourth birthday. He was extremely excited when he opened it up and got to start playing with it. Unfortunately, the numbers quit working about 5 minutes later. I got on Amazon, and within two days another register arrived. The buttons work fine on the second one, but the solar panel does not. The only way to get the numbers to light up on the screen is hold the register directly next to a light, or shine a flashlight on the solar panel. Needless to say, both are being shipped back to Amazon, and I am getting a refund. I guess the next step is to try another brand."
4,no batteries required! made in China,"My 4 yr old and almost 2 yr old LOVE this. We plan to eventually get some type of market stall but in the meantime, they love playing 'store' with some little pretend groceries we have. They don't understand how to make change yet, but I can already see that this is a toy that will grow with them. As parents, WE love that it requires no batteries!!! Just wish it weren't made in China but after shopping for something that was more environmentally friendly, we still chose to go with this because the others were just not realistic at all and this seemed to be the best compromise."
3,Broken after 3 months of play.,"I've had my eye on this educational toy for some time and finally purchased it for my children as a Christmas gift. It has had just three months of use and already three of the buttons don't work, including the ""equals"" button. Without those buttons the toy is useless for educational purposes, and it is frustrating for my five year old who wants to add sums and such. There have been so many good reviews for this product that I must conclude that I just got a dud, but it is no less disappointing."
5,Mine broke within two weeks,"I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old, but I had to return it after two weeks, as the open button would not work. I will replace it as my kids loved it. Fingers crossed the new one will last much longer!!"
4,Great Christmas present,Young friend's son loved it....he plays with all the time. Made a great gift.
4,good quality good price,"I purchased the cash register for my daughter's second birthday. We have had 2 previous cash registers with all the bells and whistles that were great for a few days, then the cash drawer no longer opened. I wanted a simpler one this time around for my youngest. We've had it for about a month now and so far so good. My four and five year olds love to play with it and use the calculator. My two year old loves the beeping credit card function and the cash drawer. I like that it does not take a battery for the calculator, it does take one for the beeping noise. I feel like this was worth the money. It seems pretty sturdy and is educational."
1,Defective,"My son loved this toy, but we returned it as the digital display never functioned properly and displayed only gibberish rather than numbers. Sure, I got my money back, but did not appreciate the hassle. Also, the drawer opens so forcefully that money flies out every time... my son needs no help making messes. Looking at other brands as I'm very hesitant to buy this product again."
3,so-so,The register is very big and bulky. One of the sticky rubber feet has come off already so it wobbles every time a button is pushed. We have had this only 6 months.
2,Not good quality,Disapointing !After just a few uses the calculator does not work. Also sometimes the draw gets stuck.I would not recommend
5,I give it 5 Stars,"I purchased this register well over 2 years ago here on Amazon. My girls still play with it on a regular basis. It is sturdy and works well. Ours has even fallen quite a few times and it hasn't broken. Some reviewers say it is cheaply made, I don't agree at all. It is very nicely made, the colors are bright , the calculator works fine and all the number buttons work very well.I give it 5 stars because it is educational , durable, pretty and fun. My girls use it to play grocery store, to play pretend shopping and they also use the money that comes with the register to play other games."
5,Great toy!,"My 6 yr old loves it to play ""store"". I love that it is solar powered and comes with educational game ideas. Great Pick!"
2,cheap,It was cheap- the quality the look. I didn't like it and sent it back right away. It wasn't what I was imagining to complete the grocery store I wanted for them.
3,Poor color of cash register,"I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I did a lot of reading online to find the best one....I was very very disappointed in the color of the cash register...it is very dark red...almost maroon/black....also..the numbers are hardly visable on the screen...there is not enough contrast...overall I was very disappointed....the sound on the credit card is very faint....it is good that the money is the acutal size...but the color on the acutal machines is not inviting and certainly not as shown in the picture....After I had received it, I saw many other cash registers in the store at a much cheaper price. I don't mind paying for the better product...but I just don't think this was it."
2,no-so-sturdy toy for preschool boy,"My 4 year old received this as a birthday gift but it does not seem to be well made. First, the feet are always coming off and I find them all over the place. Secondly, the drawer is difficult to close as it does not seem to lock in place. My son gets so frustrated that he rarely plays with it. He prefers toys that ""take a beating""...like rescue heroes which is his favorite! I guess for an extremely gentle child, perhaps this is okay."
3,Calculator Did Not Work,"I recently purchased this toy for my three and five year old children. It worked well the first day. On the second day my five year old told me the numbers were not working and the screen remained on 0. I arranged for an exchange through Amazon and am awaiting the replacement. Today I noticed another reviewer had a similar problem, so it would appear this may be a manufacturing issue. I will keep tabs on this toy's performance to be sure the replacement works. It is a shame, because it is a terrific, fun, and educational toy for children in this age group."
4,Great kids cash register,I love the calculator. I love the play time suggestions that come with it. I dislike the coins that want to jump out with the force of the opening of the drawer. My son loves this. The jumping coins do not bother him.
4,this stuff rocks!!,"This is probably the one and ONLY facial moisturizer that does not break me out at all!It's very light and has no scent to it (which is important to me)and doesn't clog your pores and become zit city!If you have sensitive,ance prone-skin,this is the moisturizer for you!"
4,good daily moisturizer,"My husband and I share our daily moisturizer and this is a product we can agree on. Great for summer wear, not to heavy for our HOT and humid Florida weather. Feels great going on. Great product at a great price."
4,Wonderful!,"Normally I wouldn't call non-fiction ""entertaining,"" but Phillip Wolf does a great job telling of the struggles facing a home that welcomes in a child with congential heart disease. I laughed in many places at the antics of Phil and his friends, and I cried in many others. Even knowing how things had to end ahead of time, I still kept hoping for a miracle. An outstanding performance by this author."
5,It's better than OK,"I first time I heard Slimm was on that Outkast song 'Gangsta S**t' and thought his rhymes and voice were pretty tight. So anyway last week I saw 'The Skinny' sitting at one of the listening stations at Virgin records megastore, so I decided to listen to it. Well the whole first half of the CD blew me away. I bought it, needless to say, (not at Virgin, though :) ) and I have to say that it's easily the best hip-hop CD I've heard this year. The CD has both really slammin club-type jams and also some really tight, ambient, mellow songs. It doesn't come across as really schizophrenic production though - for some reason it all fits together perfect and just works. If you haven't heard any of the songs off this CD, you have got to check out ""It's OK"", ""Timelock"", ""This Young G"", ""Lil Buddy"", and ""It Ain't Easy"". That should give you a feel of what this CD is about. Honestly I think even many of the non-singles on this CD are better than a lot of the hip-hop on the radio right now."
4,TIGHT,"Slim is tight. The bass bumps nicely and his lyrics go well with it. Definitely represents the ATL Sound. Buy it, No Doubt!!"
2,This fool's skills are skinny,"this album is terrible. I should have known it wasn't going to be Dungeon Fam. caliber, but I could have tuned into BET if I wanted to hear this stuff. I thought it might at least be close to some of the old outkast or DF stuff, but I would compare it more to the crap thats on the radio these days. If you're a fan of Nelly, Dem Franchise Boys, or any other radio rapper, you'll probably really enjoy this. If you're looking for some good southern hiphop with some originality, this isn't going to satisfy you."
3,brings be back to mexico,I bought this CD in the Cancun airport on the way home after spending a week in Playa del carmen... many of the songs were songs that we danced to every night at the resort.
5,A Fantastic Overview for Kids and a Good Review for Adults,"I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys biographies, inspirational reading, medieval history or beautiful illustrations. While I am Roman Catholic, a reader certainly need not share my religious beliefs to treasure this beautiful little book; I was most impressed by the amount of information that was packed into its pages in a seamless, easy to read story."
5,"Definitive, energetic and fresh account of C16th rock n roll","Simply one of the best dance compilations ever released - a definitive, fresh and energetic account of the first flowering of dance ensembles in C15-16th Europe. Still exciting nearly 20 years after its original release and a poignant reminder of the lost genius of English early music supremo David Munrow; the album was released shortly before his untimely death. Many recent collections have tried to tap into the fashion for early music but this one remains in a league of its own by virtue of the sheer energy and rhythmic drive of its performances - moving, too, in its (fewer) quiet moments. A sadly neglected ""must-have""."
5,Fabulous!,"This CD is a MUST HAVE for anyone interested in historical music. I owned ""Pleasures of The Court"" as a teenager, and was thrilled to find it re-released in this collection. The other pieces were new to me and are fantastic!! Although many pieces on this collection are indeed, soft and calming, anyone who thinks ancient music was ""slow and boring"" have another thing coming when they hear this. Some of the songs are down right loud and boistrous enough to be played at a modern ""rave"". David Munrow was such a gifted conductor and it saddens me that we had him for so short a time. (The only group whom I feel comes close to capturing the same energy and passion for this period is the London Consort under the direction of Pickett) Do yourself a favor and buy this...then play it full blast."
4,Tricky to pour when full,"The decanter is tricky to pour when its full. So when its full with 12 cups of coffee you need to pour it slow and expect it to dribble on a table or counter. This is a small issue, compared to the money you save by making your own coffee instead of buying any coffee at a store, cafe etc.Also, if you are a regular coffee drinker and plan to rely only on this coffee maker for coffee ... buy a backup decanter and store it away. It doesn't take much to crack or break the decanter."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I purchased this in hopes it wouldn't leak all over the counter every time I poured a cup, like the one I already owned. The box touted it's ""leak resistant spout"", but it actually drips even more than the one that came with my coffeemaker. The only benefit from this purchase is that now I am absolutely sure I will never buy another Mr. Coffee product."
3,Fine for what you pay.,"I only purchased this carafe after I accidentally broke my friends one. He had a Sunbeam Coffee Maker, and this was a perfect replacement. So, as a replacement it was perfect for what I needed. But I would not buy a coffee maker that had this type of carafe - as they are poorly designed and tend to leak onto the hotplate everytime you use them."
3,Coffee in a pinch,Ordered this guy right after watching my last carafe break. Its a standard carafe which is not a bad thing. I think they should have more of a selection of carafes to choose from.
3,It's a replacement,"There's not much to say other than it's a replacement decanter. My old decanter didn't have the domed center it was flat. So this one, although it fits, I have to place it into the coffee maker first then close the filter door. Mr. Coffee no longer makes the old one that went with my machine because my machine is over 7 years old. It's that good! So, this new one just changes the way I use the coffee maker, is all. I have to open and close the coffee filter thingy before I can take the decanter on and off the warming plate. (First world problems.)"
3,Not the Same Size as my Original,"For some reason this carafe is slightly taller than my original one. It looks exactly the same, but it's about 1/8 inch taller. As a result, it pushes up on the filter and doesn't drain the coffee as good. It still works, but had a known it wouldn't be an exact fit, I would have bought a whole new coffee maker."
3,On-off button a problem,"No problem making coffee, but the on-off switch is not user friendly. I had somethingleaning against it slightly and the switch went on which I didn't notice until the machinestarted smoking as there was no liquid in it. Turns on too easily but must be held withone hand to turn off. The button does not work properly."
2,Cheap lid,"After only a few uses of the replacement decanter, one of the tabs on the lid snapped off. You can tell they used a different type of plastic on the replacement decanter (handle & lid) versus the original. They are sending me a replacement lid, but if it is the same, I'm sure it won't last long either!"
3,"Does the job, good price, but too fragile","I agree with others that this carafe drips/dribbles when you pour but almost every coffee machine I've had has had the carafe do this so I'm not sure I think it's that big of a deal. My main problem with it is that it's very fragile. When you wash it, if you bang it against the faucet, even lightly, it's going to crack. I only had this coffee maker about a month before this happened. Thankfully the replacement carafe is very reasonably priced. It does the job, just be careful when washing it!"
1,Drippy needs redesign,"I have one of the many Mr. Coffee coffee makers that use the same carafe. If you pour quickly or for that matter even at a slow pace the liquid touches the plastic edge on the of the top lip and runs down the outside onto the counter, floor, your feet or what ever. I tried contacting Mr. Coffee and their customer service simply sent another carafe that drips the same way as the original. This morning it dripped on my toes again. I plan to find another coffee maker from anyone else as soon as possible."
3,Replacement is identical to OEM,"Works well, but it is just as fragile as the original decanter.I guess that is how they make up for selling the coffee pots so inexpensively..."
2,Didnt fit,The Coffee maker in my house is a 12 cup machine and this is labeled as a 12 cup carafe but did not fit in my maker. I was a little disappointed.
2,This book goes on and on,"Tara McCarthy's memoir was refreshing to find on the shelves and even entertaining to read...in the beginning. The first couple of chapters are interesting and somewhat funny. However, as the book continued, I quickly grew tired of hearing about exploit after exploit. If you are looking to use McCarthy as a role model for your children, I would should suggest otherwise. McCarthy has documented a fairly promiscious life, despite not actually having intercourse along the way. I think it is fantastic that she has decided to wait until she is love, but it is exhausting reading about the thirteen or so times she thought she might have been."
1,I have read more profound and witty graffiti,"Who knew that a book on something so potentially thought-provoking, even inspiring, could be shallow? It reminds me somewhat of the question put to Oscar Wilde in his indecency trials: ""Sir, in your opinion, is this book immoral?"" ""Oh, it's much worse than that, sir. It's badly written."" Truly awful."
3,She's not exactly a role model,"While I enjoyed reading about Tara McCarthy's relationship exploits, I found her claim to virginity rather lacking. Of course, she wrote the book before the Monica Lewinsky scandal made us all question exactly what we mean by having sex, but still, someone with her apparent intelligence should realize that any intimate activity leading to orgasm is probably sex, and that these activities, too, should not be taken lightly. Having made such mistakes in the past, I know how it can hurt to be dumped by someone with whom you have been intimate, even if that intimacy didn't lead to actual intercourse. She seems to come to this realization at the end of the book, but not before she has ""given herself"" to far too many guys who didn't really care. This book should be read -- and carefully -- by those who want to know just where to draw the line."
1,"Been to Harvard, Didn't Do Grammar","Badly written, with five errors on the first two pages, this book's success is owed to the sensationalism surrounding it, rather than to any true skill on the writer's part.Another case where good publicity has been confused with good writing and content.More little league than Ivy League ..."
5,Clever and fun!,"Digging in your flower garden may never be quite the same for you if you read Ms. Herman's THREE DIRTY WOMEN. At least that's how it worked for me once I got into chapter one. In fact, after I got settled into my armchair, I never did quite get out until I'd finished the last page. The book was just that compelling. Thing is, the characters feel like people you know, and the plot twists keep you going. You'll be sure you know who the killer is -- and then you won't. Then you'll imagine that you've figured it out once again, but . . . you won't have. Maybe that's the fun of a really good mystery, and Ms. Herman delivers on all accounts. I just hope she doesn't spend so much time in her own garden that a sequel to this terrific book has to wait. We need more -- in spades!"
3,Mystery Writing 101,"The writing does not live up to the clever premise or even the cute title of this cozy mystery. Characterization is shallow or over-the-top, the setting is not well sketched, and the story moves around with too many two-named characters, and not enough fluidity between scenes. By the time I reached the end of the book, I didn't care who had committed the murder. I was just thrilled to finally be finished with it. I was hoping for an exploration of the strengths and wonders of middle-aged friendship, with dashes of gardening lore thrown into a setting that was being steadily beautified. Something more like Susan Wittig Albert's China Bayles series."
4,Get it if you liked the first ones.,"Simply put, this is every bit as funny as its predacessors, but after three or four, these books start to get old. They all feel the same, and if you read them too close together then you might get sick of them and Georgia's shallowness. On the bright side, the Georgia books are truly ""laugh out loud"" funny, and they will cheer you up. Enjoyed the first ones? You'll like this one. And by the way, read them in order."
4,yay! more georgia!,"Georgia kept me rolling on the floor again! In this one she shamelessly cheats on her Sex God boyfriend while he's out of the country. From Dave the Laugh to Mark Big Gob to the new lead singer of the Stiff Dylans, she gets around! I love the way she writes down the kinds of things that I'd be to scared to put in writing. She puts everything down; her snogging encounters, embarassing moments, ace gang gatherings and much more. This next book is deffinetly worth your time."
4,Scrumboes!,"Fun, funny, silly, and tres amusant, this fifth installment of the Confessions of Georgia Nicolson just keeps being the same amount of fun. I was going to say that it keeps getting better, but that's not exactly true. It gets a little bit more unbelievable, as apparently no matter how much weird stuff Georgia does or says, people in her life still seem to adore her, especially boys. It has been my experience that the average-looking, funny girl (no matter what the size of her nunga-nungas, does not manage to capture the interest of not one, but two, highly-sought after, Sex Goddy, lead singer(s) of a popular band, and Dave the Laugh as well. Possibly, however; these things do happen in England. In that case, I wish to go back in time and force my parents to move to Brighton or some other quaint British town.Still, so much fun to read, and I will be waiting with baited breath for the next volume."
5,"Great Book! (Fairfax, Virginia)","This book was fantastic! I laughed all the way through, being from England all of the slang made sense! If you liked the rest of the series, you are sure to like this book too! I really enjoy reading about problems that occur in my life as well as anyone else's. Pick this up NOW and get ready to laugh your self to tears! I recommend this book to teenage girls and maybe young women."
1,This is for the CD version only,"I love this series and this installment, but the audio version was very unsatifying...not only is it not narrated by the person who did all the others (and did a much better job), They also leave out the 'Note from Georgia' AND the glossary in the back of the book for no apparent reason...If I'm going to pay for this to be unabridged, why am I not getting the whole book?Another irritating thing is the fact that they only recorded it on cds, they might be better in the long run, but, are harder to listen to, because you can't stop it and leave it excatly where you were, you must start wherever it tracks (3-4 minutes) unless you just leave your cd played paused, which drains batteries.so, I love the story but I hated this audio version..."
4,Away Laughing on a Fast Camel,"I found this book to be a fun read. It is written in the first person from the perspective of a teenage girl in England. The ""lingo"" is a bit hard to follow, but one can easily begin to feel a part of Georgia's life and understand her feelings. The book moves a mile a minute, as does Georgia's multi-faceted world. She has parents that embarass her, a little sister that ""LUUUUURVES"" her and a very promiscuous tomcat named Angus. She talks a lot about snogging, (kissing), her desire to make a boy fall in love with her, her friends and how they are way too immature for her and how frustrating it is to be in a family of ""crazies""!Every teenager could find something they'd relate to in this book. They will surely laugh outloud, as I did, while reading it."
5,Best Book,"This book was great. The best book in the series so far because of the humor. If you don't like English humor though, you will hate this book. Or English accents. But Georgia Nicolson is your regular everyday girl who falls in and out of love more often than she puts on make up (which is a LOT). It was an awesome book, and Georgia always has the most hilarious thoughts, even if she's not aware of the hilariosity of her life. Definitely a must read."
4,A good book,"I liked this book it was hilarious , and the situations were cool too. But through like half the book she crying and whining and stuff and then she makes out with like two guys and gets her heart broken , she just puts herself out there you know . But all in all it was good."
5,Another great installment...,"'Away Laughing on a Fast Camel' is even better than the previous books in the series. Louise Rennison continues to write hillariously funny books detailing the adventures of Georgia Nicolson. Although some of the jokes become repetitive (after hearing them in previous books), there are plenty of new laughs and scenarios to hold your interest. A must read!"
1,Budapest,"This DVD is a waste of money. Duration is 10 minutes, camera work is extremely amateurish, music is cheesy and apperance is dated.Shame on Amazon for even have this DVD on their catalogue."
1,Wesbar Submersible Tail Light,Tail light was installed on PWC trailer and functioned flawlessly until it was submersed in water. This light is not submersible as it suggest.
4,should replace all high-school history books,"I first heard about Noam Chomsky when Jello Biafra made a reference to him on one of his spoken-word albums, which led me to pick up ""Understanding Power."" I must say, this book is a harrowing retrospective of all the rotten things America has done since the early 20th century, and basically what can be done to prevent a future that rests in the hands of all-controlling corporations. It goes without saying that Chomsky's glasses are anything BUT rose-colored, but his points are valid and honest--if you can't deal with what he's saying, the evening news is waiting for you."
5,Excellent,"An excellent critical reader that speaks to a wide range of issues.Academia - check.Ideological manipulation - check.Institutional interlocks - check.Corporate, govermental and ideological intersects -- check check.A book that should be read by all, really."
1,Shill of Financial Elites,"Simply read ""Understanding Power"" if you have any doubt that Chomsky is fake opposition. In this book he exhaustively examines the wide variety of corporate, political, and media power centers in America yet somehow never mentions the banking industry. There is no mention of the most profitable company in the world, Citigroup. This MIT genius has to at least have some idea that ""money is power"" and therefore in his book examining all the major power centers it is absolutely impossible that he would not mention the industry that has a monopoly on creating every single dollar in the world.My guess is that he serves a very useful role to the financial elites by exposing just enough real political and corporate corruption to keep the public satisfied that our media is sufficiently vigilant while keeping us distracted from the core source of power and corruption which is the creation of fiat money."
5,UNDERSTANDING POWER CHOMSKY AT HIS BEST,UNDERSTANDING POWER HONEST TRUTHFUL INDISPENSABLE CHOMSKY AT HIS BEST CLEARS MY MIND OF THE PROPAGANDA OF THE ORTHODOX PRESS NEED I SAY MORE
5,Great book,"Covers many a topics from censorship in the academia to the usual American imperialism. Read it then do some research of your own to fully understand the issues because the book, quite frankly, leaves out a lotYes, Chomsky is one of the most important intellectuals of our time, a world wonder indeed, and yeah he's a linguistics prof."
5,Excellent work,"This is an outstanding book for anyone who has heard about Noam Chomsky and would like to explore some of his ideals.Whether you agree with him or not, does not get away from the fact that this is an excellent book for the beginner reader or the vivid fan of Chomsky as the book is broken up into many sections of different topics that Chomsky discusses.The only down side to this book would be if you are not ready to open up your mind. If you believe questioning your government is unpatriotic, then this book isn't for you. Just because you question your government, it doesn't mean you don't love your country."
3,Classic Chomsky,"While Noam Chomsky has much valuable insight into the workings of the social machine, he is not afraid to follow some of his thoughts off a cliff. Conspiracies DO exist amongst the powerful, but they are not nearly as organized and absolute as Chomsky seems to think. We live in a sloppy world in which the well-connected exercise an inordinate amount of power, but I disagree that they get together at regular intervals to plot their next moves. Those who exercise power do so largely because most people are too lazy to do anything to prevent them."
4,First Chomsky book..definatly Not my last..,"For years I heard about Noam Chomsky and so I decided to finally read something of his.Wow..While this book is not ""written"" but rather material from transcribed conversations (thus a bit difficult at times to read) it still is packed with interesting information and opinions and facts about the way the US has wielded power, tried to manipulate and control everything...whether they be Democratic Presidents or Republicans both parties have been accomplices to injustice and hypocrisy...We need a new paradigm for the way the US works in the world.. if we are going to survive as a nation intact...PeaceCaeli"
1,Chomsky should know.,Buy this book. Cult of CHomsky. What has Chomsky done with his fame and fortune? Nothing positive.
1,what a fereng,I reccomend this book as a study in hypocracy.Chumpsky sets himself up as a cool defender of the people when he si in reality a tax-paid government bureaucrat without a brain in his non-creative head.He's a simple communist who thinks those who are successful in america don't produce anything.Reality shows differently.it's amazing how this guys writings stink like a dead headgehog under the flooboards though as wave after wave of leftist college student chew on his fattening literary fare.Basically this guy is responsible for lowering iq points of million of college students a year.
5,"Earl Grey, Hot","This is a strongly aromatic version of Earl Grey, scented with citrusy bergamot. If you like a mild Earl Grey, this may be a bit strong for you. I personally love it. One of my favorites."
2,Not too bad...I guess???,I have been drinking Earl Grey for a little over a year. Have tried several brands and this was not the best. I'm thinking it would be good for novelty drinkers...and don't let this avert you from the Tazo brand because they have several other flavors I highly enjoy...just not the Earl Grey.
2,Not treat-sized,"I also bought a bag of ZiwiPeak dog food and it's the same size and texture as the treats. A bit small so you need to give a few at a time. I'd just use the real food as treats and save a bunch of money. I am not feeding this to my Boston Terrier, but will keep the $40 approx I spend on both to use as treats."
5,Doggies loved them!,"Tried these on 4 different doggies and they were a big hit. Wholesome, healthy snack."
1,Inaudible sountrack.,"I don't know what kind of remastering they did, but the sountrack is almost unintelligible. That's a shame, since the dialogue is reputed to be pretty snappy."
2,DARK PAGES OF THE AMERICAN PRESS,"WELL DEVELOPED SCRIPT WITH EXCELLENT DIALOGUE AND MIXTURE OF HUMOR AND SOCIAL AWARENESS. TRUE CLASSIC WHICH WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN INSPIRING FILMS LIKE: ACE IN THE HOLE, SCANDAL SHEET, DEADLINE USA BRAVO....on problems is this edition of the film is poorly transferred in sound. one can hardly understand the actors dialogue..terrible"
1,A Cheap Public Domain Knockoff,"""Re-mastered"" my eye! This is a horrible transfer of a horrible third generation print, with horrible sound. Half of the witty dialogue is unintelligible. I gave up after about five minutes."
1,Unintelligible sound,The sound was so distorted neither of us could understand the dialog. We gave up watching it after 15 minutes.
1,BEWARE: AVOID MIRACLE PICTURES VERSION AT ALL COST!!!!!!,"DON'T BUY THE MIRACLE PICTURES VERSION OF 'THE FRONT PAGE.' It's unwatchable. Even at $.01 (from an amazon seller) plus postage, it's a rip-off. Picture jumps; sound is atrocious! Dialogue? Forget it. P.T. Barnum is (erroneously) credited with saying ""There's a sucker born every minute"" and I guess I'm one of them. Beware!"
3,The Front Page (1931),"""The Front Page"" is a classic early talking comedy. I rate the movie five starts for content.Unfortunately, however, this inexpensive DVD is completely unrestored; there are major problems with both its image and sound quality. Its physical quality rates only one star, producing a joint content+physical quality rating of three stars (5+1divided by 2).Hopefully a fully restored version of this materpiece will come out at less than twenty dollars in the next few years."
3,Still in need of restoration!,"The previous reviews, read carefully, make it clear that this ""remastered"" edition still shows its age. Milestone is a fine director of early sound films--his All Quiet on the Western Front is a masterpiece--who overcame the drawbacks of the new and still being developed early sound technology. But do be warned--even though The Front Page is a fascinating and still vivid film, with obvious interest for anyone trying to look into the antecedents of His Girl Friday, this DVD edition will tax your eyes and ears! If ever a film was in need of a high quality digital restoration, this is it! I had hoped to use this is a film studies class, but now I am not so sure.On a side note, the film is a window into some really good acting techniques ca. 1930: the character actors playing the various reporters are terrific, one and all. And the pre-code frankness of Edward Everett Horton's effeminately ""gay"" performance as Benzinger is a delight."
4,Good book,"Only read a little bit of it for a site engineering class, but what I read seemed pretty good. Stuff about calculating slopes, interpolating contours, all kinds of grading stuff. For a method of interpolating contours from a grid of given spot elevations, it shows a more complicated, algebraic way, and a really simple way as well."
2,"Mediocre strip quality, way overpriced","For the price, this stripper should work much better. It doesn't cut the braid cleanly, leaving ragged patches sticking out. Yes, I have it adjusted properly.You can't spin it with your index finger, as the instructions say, or it will wobble out of alignment. Also, it is difficult to adjust. I estimate it required about 20 test strips before it was tweaked in. Repeatability is only fair.I also use a Canare TS-31C stripper, which costs about half what this one does, and is FAR superior. In fact, the cheaper Canare strippers are so much better than this, I have to categorize this as a ripoff."
5,Love this Book!,This is a very cool book about small engines that includes well taken pictures. After reading this book you will want to hang out in the garage and rebuild the lawnmower. Perfect for the putterer and tinkerer.
1,Won't help you repair your engine,"Peter Hunn really missed the mark on this book. This is not a instruction handbook. First, this book was released in 2005, but the newest engine reviewed is a 1990's lawnmower engine. It is a series of case studies of very old products. Secondly, it has only about 30 pages related to engine troubleshooting. If you want a process/methodology to repair or rebuild engines or engine parts (carburetors), look else where. Finally, Peter is certainly knowledgeable but really needs more writing help in structuring his knowledge so its' useful to the average person looking for engine repair help."
1,Not the Textbook.,"I brought this one, thinking it was the textbook without a hardcover. It is a workbook. Make sure when ordering you are ordering the textbook and not the workbook. I will now have to get the textbook overnighted."
2,Content Fine - Condition? Not so much.,"I'm not really a physics kind of guy - I just have to take the class for a degree. The content has been reasonable thus far in regards to organization (meaning simple to complex - known to unknown - plenty of practice with ever increasingly complex iterations of problems to solve). The condition of the book which was advertised as ""good"" is actually poor at best. Interior pages are falling out due to the ineffective glue at the first and last pages allowing separation of many pages from the cover. If it had been advertised as ""poor condition"" and priced accordingly, I wouldn't have issue with this, but it was advertised as ""good condition"" which it is not. At this point in the course, I really don't have time to return it and ask for another . . . so, I just have to go with it for another 13 weeks."
4,The Pocket Guide is Handy,"TheStudent Pocket Guide for College Physicsis a handy little book. I would have given it 5 stars, if it had more formulas in it. It is really great for lab and to read before lecture, so you get a heads-up on what your professor is going to be discussing. It is far from a necessity but I am happy I got it, and I have gotten a lot of use out of it. In fact copy has gotten pretty dog-eared from toting it around. In short, it is kind of like CliffsNotes or a SparkNotes book for your physics book."
2,Not what I thought,I was expecting to receive a book and instead I got a binder with all the pages in it. Wasn't too happy when it came in the mail.
5,Slight Wear,The book has slight wear on the cover but that was mentioned in the description. There is also some writing in the book but overall it is in very good condition.
3,sloppy book,"I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com. This book is sloppy because my professor always tells us that don't trust the formulars from the book. However, the book does cover something interesting and related to our everyday life."
2,beat,the pages were written on and a couple fell out. the cover was worn through to the cardboard at every corner
2,It's alright,I don't mind the book itself it's just that I paid so much money for a BRAND NEW book that didn't even come with the Key code for the internet site which was an extra $60.50. Plus it's not even worth that much money.
4,Good start for studying physics,"For someone looking to get an overview of basic physics, this book is great. The problems in the back of each chapter start out easy then become more and more challenging. In several chapters there are photos of some physics instructors doing experiments we all want to do; one of the best is an experiment where someone is sitting in a chair holding a very large CO2 fire extinguisher and... rockets off! It does a very good job of explaining Newton's laws. (every action has an equal and opposite reaction) If you purchase this text, make sure to get the associated study guide. It not only provides a review of each chapter, it goes through step by step problem solving on slected odd numbered problems. The only caveat is that some of the wording is vague; there was an attempt to explain physics without calculus. As a result, some subjects must be taken on faith. If life sciences is your major then this text does a great job of explaining physics."
1,Not a good book at all.,"I'm an engineer who has taken many physics classes and taught physics once at a community college. Now one of my children is using this in school for learning AP physics B. I can honestly say if this had been my first exposure to physics, I'd be in a different profession.I find some of the choices to emphasize certain things quite strange. For example, the book spends an inordinately long time on the difference between speed and velocity and then the author uses them wrong in a problem at the end of the chapter. But then elastic collisions don't get nearly the space I'd give (or other books give) them.Also, this book's explanation of torque is one of the worst explanation of a technical concept I've ever seen. I've only read through to chapter 7 so I'm sure there is a lot more to complain about.I dug up one of my 25 year old textbooks and my daughter uses that instead to learn from and gets everything much more easily."
1,TO H.S. STUDENTS-,"I really do not recommend this book for any high school students struggling in Physics. I am a junior who is in a physics honor course. My class uses this book and I can say for sure that 9/10 of my classmates dread this book. The authors' phrasings are too complex and very detailed. When I read I can not help to feel that I am reading some lab report. Yeah, it may seem like ""a nice review"" for some people. People who are actually in college or majoring in physics!! My review just goes out to high school students who are looking for some supplement or extra help in physics. This with certainty, will not help you! It'll confuse you even more."
1,very frustrated,"The book is not easy to follow. This book has an online portion but the access code they provide is difficult to read and the site is difficult to get help through because they ask for the code. The sight also constantly tells you that you haven't completed information that was never asked for. I even when back over the page and never found the box they were referring to. I went to the site because the material presented in the book is difficult to follow. It does not provide step by step instructions. ""Basic Physics-a self teaching guide"" is much better. I hope some teachers read this and look into other books for their classes."
4,Fantastique recording,"I would rate this performance of Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique only slightly behind Beecham and Munch and about equal with Paray. Eugene Ormandy never seems to be mentioned when discussing the great conductors of last century, and I really can't figure out why. He consistently put out solid performances with the excellent Philadelphia Orchestra throughout the 50's and 60's, while Szell was doing the same with the Cleveland Orchestra. The sound is very good throughout."
1,Option Trading DVD,I didn't think the DVD was worth the price. I really didn't get any knowledge worth using. The product is way overpriced and not professionallyedited.
1,DISRESPECTFUL,Hi everyone I am 13 and I am a true MJ fan. I don't know if anybody should buy this. The title is so disrespectful. The man tried to do what he could for humanity. No one is perfect and we all have our crazy things we do. Give MJ a break.
5,Best Book on Charlton Heston--The Man,"Michael Munn's biography is the best book I have read which gave an excellent insight into Charlton Heston--the real man. This books tells about Charlton's meager beginnings as a shy-loner living in the Michigan's woods, who later turned into the epic-hero-actor in classic films such as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, BEN HUR, EL CID & THE PLANET OF THE APES. This book helped me to understand the kind of person Mr. Heston REALLY is. Information about his family life, his relationship with his wife-Lydia who he has been married to over 50 years. Michael Munn has direct quotes from interviews he held with Charlton, his wife Lydia, Fraser & Holly (his children) throughout the book, which allows the reader to know exactly how the actor & family felt at the time about certain events in Charlton's life. This is a 'Must-Read' for any Heston fan. MonaK"
2,"Ok, but not good.",The Jack markings on the adaptor where all wrong. Line 1 and line 2 were swapped. It took me hours to figure out what was wrong.
3,interesting,"This is a very nice little book but......I did not see anything in the original discription that identified the trees listed as being east of the Rocky Mountains. I live in New Mexico, which is high desert and part of the Rockies. According to the book there is one that is for this area, only the one I received is not it."
1,This book is good,"This book helps you find a lot of trees that u need to know. I don't give it 1 star, but I think that it looks cool!"
3,A good but not great little book,"This book is helpful in identifying trees with clear distinctives in their leaves. I had trouble with evergreens whose needles didn't seem to fit the choices that were given. There needs to be more mention of cones, fruit, tree shape, etc. It is, however, small, convenient and helpful with many trees."
2,bad pictures- cheap book,Not at all what I was expecting. Pictures were lousy and it was more of a long brochure than it was a book. The pamphlet you receive for free from Arborday.org is better than this.
3,TREE FINDER BOOK,"This book was not comprehensive enough for me, and it was not specific enough in detail. The book didn't help me determine the tree species very well."
3,Good enough mag - poor customer service...,"Entertaining enough magazine - but upon missing delivery of an issue multiple emails to the 'Front Desk' and 'Subscription Department' simply go unanswered and the customer service phone support person never followed through. So, when my subscription expires I'll move on."
4,"Like dark, bitter chocolate","A real treat for fans of author Hakan Nesser. Ewa Moreno finally steps into the lead. This is a well crafted story. Moreno's interactions with her old boss, Van Veeteren, now in retirement at his book store, and Ja'an her new CID partner are fascinating. This is for those who love dark, bittersweet Nordic mysteries (even the music is beautiful & sad). I hope Nesser writes a new series focused on Moreno! !"
2,READ THIS!!,"I have to say that you can NOT look at the picture when ordering this! It only includes the top item. While I did, however, like the durability of the bone, I was disappointed that I didn't read more carefully. The add should have been more clear!"
1,Dissatisfied,"This product is extremely poor quality. Too bad Gilmour's hose fittings are not as good as their hoses. The guage of the ""brass"" is about the same thickness as the metal on a pencil eraser (okay, maybe not that thin, but you get my point). When I attached it to my new 250 ft Gilmour 8 guage hose, water squirted everywhere. I tried to reattach it with pliers again but the water kept spurting out, but not quite as heavily. I came back an hour later only to find that the fitting completely fell off the end of the hose and my yard was saturated. I then went to Ace Hardware and got a good fitting made of a heavier guage metal that fits on the hose much more securely. It works like a charm. Avoid Gilmour hose fittings at all cost- they need to stick with water hoses rather than fittings."
3,It's okay,I didn't realize all 3 movies would be on one disc. I'm going to watch for that from now on.
5,Recipient was very happy,I purchased this set as a gift for my father. He was very happy with all three movies and said they were some of his favorites.
5,Classic Clint Eastwood,"If you're a Clint Eastwood fan these movies are a must have... if you like fist fighting, raunchy humor and hilarious old ladies you'll love this movie. Oh, and let's not forget good old Clyde. This humorous Orangutan just added the extra oomph this movie needed. The action was great."
3,Great Classic,"This was an awesome classic collection. If you like sarcasim & Clint Eastwood, you won't go wrong with this set!"
2,Liked the idea,I liked the idea of this show in the beginning but only watched a few episodes before dropping it from my list of shows. Not into all the sex junk which sucks because I love the idea of all the different creatures etc! Not for me or a friend of mine. I hope they put out another good show with less of that crap! Syfy has many other shows I love and I give 5 stars so it's all good!
5,Love this show!!,"Love this show , love the characters, Love Trick, I think he might be the best part of the show!, love everything about it! Waiting impatiently for season 3 to come out on on dvd!"
4,Love the first season,The first season was the best yet and I didn't care for the second season as much as the first but hope when it comes back we will see more of the kin of seens in the first season.
3,"Lost the Show, but the DVD offers nothing more.","I fell in love with this show once I discovered it, couldn't stop watching and bought both seasons before I finished the second season. I want more of this show, but the menu is poorly put together and the extras leave something to desire mostly a play all button."
5,My favorite,I love this show! its my favorite. Its fun and sexy and keeps you guessing. Its not an original idea but they make it interesting!
3,Unlikely Girl,The story line could be better. The hero always needs rescuing. The weather is always wet and gloomy. I like the young girl'a acting and persona.
5,Alternative treatments for Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,My partner has both Fibromyalgia and CFS and this booklet with its fully explained contents on Alternative Treatments has given us a most informative insight into these. In the area we live one of the biggest problems is finding a Doctor thats fully understands and can treat accordingly by using conventional and alternative means. We also do not have a support group in the area and we both have learnt so much in this wonderful book.We can now from the book understand a lot of what has happened almost on a daily basis for my partner as sections in this book are spot on with regular body signs and symptoms.
1,Poor quality tea,"I like black tea and have tried many kinds, but I find Tazo's Awake to be awful. Starbuck's serves it and I think it's very bitter and have ended up tossing it. I've tried it a few times hoping that maybe something went wrong the first time. No, it's just a poor tasting tea. Not sure about Tazo's other teas. I suggest trying Tetley, Red Rose, or Stash's English Breakfast for good black tea."
1,Consistently Bad,"I drink ALOT of black tea(loose and bags)and have retried Tazo's Awake Tea now and again through the years.And I have to say they are consistent.It always tastes the same;it always tastes bad.I have a box now that I can't get through.My recommendations for English style bagged tea would be:PG Tips,Darvilles of Windsor,or Yorkshire Tea."
3,Has this tea changed?,"For a bag tea--which generally are not as good quality, this brews up like a top quality loose tea. It's a delicious snappy black blend, with a lovely scent and taste. One of my favorites.HOWEVER: In case you didn't read the comment left after this review: this tea has apparently changed. I have not bought it in a while (I'm drinking another brand at the moment.) This review is dated. I have also heard this about Lipton as well. The tea is not the same. Buyer beware."
4,A Life Saver,"As the previous reviewer suggests - drink for the caffeine. If you're among the flock of rare non-coffee drinking birds - it's a good idea to keep a few bags of Tazo Awake in the glove compartment. Then, of course, you can always go to your local Starbucks to get some. Starbucks didn't always own Tazo. They bought out what began as a very clever enterprise, which, since the corporate takeover, has stagnated. The best popular brand black tea readily available. However, Borneo Rainforest Organic Black Tea is the purest and tastiest bagged black tea I have found, vastly superior to Tazo, imported from Malaysia by Borneotea Company, available on the net. Also, Amazon Herb Company's Rainforest Treasure Tea keeps you up as effectively (though not nearly as inexpensively) without the caffeine."
2,A Major Disappointment,"With its new-look packaging, Tazo also reformulated the Awake tea blend. The old blend was strong, robust, and biting. It was by far my favorite bagged black tea. The new blend is weaker and maltier; it is sadly reminiscent of standard Lipton tea. If I want Lipton tea, I'll buy Lipton tea; it's a lot cheaper than Tazo.I know that many people found the old blend to be too bitter. Tazo apparently decided that they'd gain more customers than they'd lose if they toned down the flavor. I don't know if they're right, but they've definitely lost me."
3,Not up to expectations,English Breakfast tea is my go to morning drink. It's smooth and subtle while providing the early caffeine boost. Tazo's Awake version is sort of a letdown. It doesn't taste as full as some of the other brands. Not much different in taste and affect than a bulk store black tea. I also got Tazo's earl grey which was better. Overall not a bad experience but ill stick with more traditional brands for my black teas.
5,pick me up,whenever my daughter feels like she needs a pick me up tea then this is her choice to go to.
4,Good game,"I gave this game to my 3 year old for Christmas, but was a little leary after reading the other online reviews.He understands it just fine, and we have fun playing it. After playing just a couple of times, he better understands what 'rhyming' means.As long as you plan on sitting down and playing the game with your preschooler, the game is good."
2,too complicated to be fun,"Well, after a year of having this game neither myself or my husband fully understand it. I remember a few reviews saying it was complicated - they are right. Much too complicated for the kindergarten set that would probably be most attracted to it due it's name. Save your money"
4,Dr. Seuss Green Eggs and Ham Board Game,I believe the only reason we enjoy the game is because of the memory involved although I have a feeling in several months my 5 year old daughter will be bored with it.
3,not bad but not great either.,"If you have the first edition AD&D stuff by Gygax, then you really don't need this book. Its basically AD&D with some funny commentary every once in a while. I bought this thing when i decided to get back into gaming. I wanted something simple so i could introduce new players to dungeons and dragons. I took one look at the character creation part and decided that Hackmaster wasn't for the group i was putting together. It would have taken three hours to roll up. definately not a way to introduce new folks to the game, but if you hate the D20 stuff and you want to get into gaming the way it was in the good old days then you should give hackmaster a try."
3,Good movies but.......,"Disc 2 contains ""Life with Father"" & ""My Man Godfrey"" bothof which are excellent. Unfortunately, Disc 1 does not playon my DVD player,although it plays on my computer. I'mtold that this is probably because the manufacturer used aninformation/data disc instead of a DVD disc to be played on a DVDplayer. Amazon is willing to exchange it but for $6.98 it's notworth the trouble."
1,Completely Unwatchable!!,"While all four of these films are classic comedy gems, especially ""My Man Godfrey"" (which is my personal favourite), this set is overwhelmingly lackluster and, as previously stated, unwatchable. The sound and picture quality is horrendous. For boasting that the films have been ""digitally re-mastered"" all four look as though they have been directly ripped from a VHS. The sound quality is crackled and hard to hear at times- despite the DVD cover also boasting that the sound has been ""enhanced"". For the color films ""Nothing Sacred"" and ""Life with Father""- the color is completely washed out to the point that you wish both films was in black and white.If you are looking for any of these four films by themselves, go elsewhere! This set is not worth the money!"
4,"Good movies, still disappointed","I was not aware that the stars were not both in all of the movies, so was disappointed. Still worth the money."
2,I was misled by the caption on the front.,I expected that all four movies would star both Carole Lombard and William Powell. Only one does. I already have copies of two of the movies in the collection. Surely this would disappoint any one who purchased the set
5,Powell and Lombard,Excellent examples of 1930's comedies. I find watching 1930's comedies very relaxing and enjoyable.
3,Powell and Lombard TCM video set,"I bought this after a recommendation by Amazon. However, when I bought this, I found I already had this one case, in a previous set I had bought from Amazon."
1,frustrated,"i have placed many orders for this collection.somtimes sold ,out of stock.often sellers keep sold units for many weeks after out of stock.i have yet to make a purchase for this dvd."
1,Who knows?,I never received this one. I even forgot I ordered it but it's not in my collection so it never came.
1,KODAK CX7330 - CHARGING ISSUES,"I purchased this camera in Dec. 04. I started having charging probelms shortly after. Sent back to Kodak 3 different times before they finally replaced with a refurbished camera. Now having same problem. Camera will not hold charge and will not turn on or shut off shortly after turning on. Customer service in India has been useless. Spent over 7 hours on the phone with them so far. Alleged ""consumer advocate"" is supposed to help. Should really be called company advocate as Kodak pays him/her not the consumer."
1,Battery Power Problems,"Like other reviewers, I've had issues with the camera shutting down or not powering up at all, even with new batteries. I've tried 3 different battery types, with no solution. These problems started after 6 months of light use (30-40 pictures). I think this camera has a firmware bug or internal defect. A definite lemon. I won't buy a Kodak again."
2,Very disappointed!,"I agree with Shelly. This camera takes great pictures BUT worked properly for about a month. I sent it back to kodak and they repaired some things and it's malfunctioning again! It is no longer under warranty so I might as well by a new one. It goes off and on by itself, the lens pops out, then back in, its ridiculous. They said for me to use lithium batteries, so that I did, and they do last forever it seems (much longer than rechargable) but its still acting up. I thought I would've gotten a much better camera from kodak. Going to try a different brand next."
2,Easy share,I am not impressed with Kodak Printer Dock. The camera works great but the dock has many compatibility issues with Windows. Have updated software and still have problems with Easyshare not responding or not printing photos. Maybe eventually Kodak will solve these issues but for now the printer dock is hit and miss.
1,Don't ship it!,"The product is a good one, but don't ship it. The box was crushed, due to it not being properly packaged."
2,should make bigger boxes,"24 teabags isn't even enough for one pot. Perhaps my tastes run contrary to the mainstream, but I like my tea very strong."
3,"Light on Ginger, Heavy on Pear","NB: My review is of the tea itself and not the merchant. Also, although 24 tea bags is listed, only 20 come in the box.Straight out of the package the aroma was a halting sweet and spicy with fruity undertones made even more potent when brewed. It's too bad that the taste couldn't live up to that exciting fragrance. From the name (Green Ginger) I expected to taste a bit more ginger and a lot less pear. To be clear, the tea was all right, but rather underwhelming for this ginger lover."
4,BUYER BEWARE,"okay -- first, the tea is terrific. since we ALL have different taste buds {flash back to 8th grade science class with the litmus paper test, where half the class tasted bitterness and the rest tasted nothing :o) }, so people will have different reactions, obviously. this is one of the best tasting teas--period; the ginger/pear hints are phenomenal and even the smell is incredible before the tasting experience. having said that, you need to know if you are doing price shopping, amazon is WRONG w/the tea bag count...there are ONLY 20 bags, NOT 24; hence, it would have been cheaper @ other websites, so very disappointed..."
5,Tazo Green Ginger Tea,"I love this tea and have a hard time finding it in stores so I was thrilled when I found it available on 'Subscribe and Save'. Unfortunately, even before my first order was gone, the item was discontinued. Doesn't give me a lot of faith in 'Subsribe and Save' for ordering specific, hard-to-find items."
3,let say I've heard better and worse sabbath covers,their is a nack to covering any song suttle changes and nothing drastic.this collection has acouple of good covers and some are bad but the nib cover have arealy good singer it sound just like ozzy & wheels of confusion is a a very good likeness.
2,"Good ideas, but poor development","On the surface, the book sounds interesting. The descriptions of the charcters are intriguing. Unfortunately, the plot is rather awkward and silly. The dialog is occasionally witty, but mostly awful. The dialect of the black characters is just plain offensive. Here is proof of how hard it is to write a good book, given an interesting premise."
2,Probably need to read the others first,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It was more like a gothic than a standard mystery. I found Hillary -- who, I assume, is supposed to be a sort of send-up of Martha Stewart -- bizarre with her decorating tips at the oddest moments. She wasn't the least bit realistic. And, as a native Southerner, I was expecting more development of that angle, which didn't happen (at least, not in any good way). But I think my unhappiness may be because I missed the character development earlier in the series. I imagine I should have started with the first book."
2,totally unrealistic,"I absolutely love time travel romance novels. But this one is beyond me. The way the people speak, especially Bella - who's from the present, is way too proper and totally unrealistic. It actually ruined the book for me. I had to force myself to continue reading, hoping that something interesting would happen, but I was sadly disappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially as an introduction to what time-travel romance novels are usually like. I am actually afraid to waste my money on anything else by Eugenia Riley. For a terrific read, I strongly recommend Lyverle Spencer (for historical romances) and Constance O'Day Flannery (for time-travel romances). Maybe I'll have better luck next time."
4,"typical, but good","I read this book a few years ago when I was in college; as a voice major I may have found it more interesting than someone who is not an opera enthusiast. The story is a bit see-through and the love scenes are very typical, but it's a great story to cozy up with on a rainy day when you have nothing to do. Sure it's unrealistic, but what romance novel isn't?"
3,Phantom in time,"Great idea but it just didn't live up to what the story could have been. I liked the male character better than female, she was just okay. She needed more charactistics that would have made her more likable, more spunk etc..."
3,Missed chances,"There were several misspellings and incorrect facts in this book. That being said, I gave it as a present to a major Alabama fan and he had fun correcting the book! Maybe presented as a ""find the issues"" present would be better. Otherwise, great book"
5,Charming and Bewitching!,"I just love this CD! Erich Kunz was, along with Fritz Kreisler, the personification of the Old Vienna. His Figaro, Leporello, and Papageno arias are incomparable. He also sings one Don Giovanni's aria with Seefried as well (and how warm and seductive he was as Don!). J. Strauss arias are sung with melting Viennese charm, well supported by equally sensitive and charming orchestra. The Viennese songs are sung sweetly and with fatherly warmth. The Schrammel ensemble that accompanies Kunz is also excellent and has full of atmosphere. Transfer is well done overall, except I seem to hear some gradual rising of pitch in some of the Viennese songs. But that is just a small flaw. The singing is exquisite, and that is all it matters."
4,rock and rap confidential tell us,"Bayou Groove, Kevin Naquin & the Ossun Playboys (Swallow)- Cajun band, leader/accordion player Naquin is only 24 while the guitarist is 17 and the bass player 16. pumping, jumping sound, pedal steel or fiddle. ""Papa A Mon Cote,"" Naquin's autobiographical story of a bride who lost her father at age three and walks up the aisle seemingly alone, but actually (?) accompanied by her pop."
3,"Great introduction, but clearly a first edition","I'm just finishing a semester-long course which uses this book as an outline and as a source for homework questions. Anyone with basic knowledge of analysis will have no problem picking up this book and learning a great deal about Fourier decomposition and transformations, but there are a few problems with it. The questions at the end of each section don't always make it clear exactly what is to be answered and what is to be assumed. Also, there have been a few questions that neither I, my classmates, nor my professor could solve, which leads me to believe that there are fundamental problems with a few of the questions (I could be wrong though ;) ) Finally, the last chapter seems to use different notation for some things than is used in the rest of the book, so be alert. Overall, the clarity of the material outweighs these flaws and if you have any interest in REALLY understanding Fourier and Wavelet series, get this book."
2,Not too impressed.,"This mix (or mash) has a lot of great songs for fans of this genre, but the mixing is horrible. I have noticed a trend on similar mix CDs where the DJ mashes the songs together instead of mixing matching the beats. This one takes that idea to a whole new level. It's almost like they tried as hard as they could to make it sound like they didn't care about the mixing. I consider it forced and carefully planned apathy."
3,Julie's voice is the most beautiful in Pop.,"Anyone who saw 'Rock Follies' on PBS during the 70s and heard Julie Covington for the first time will always remember her. But, for me Julie is the voice of 'Evita'. Her London 'Evita' is still the best and as far as I'm concerned every other version of 'Don't Cry for me Argentina' is an cover to the original haunting Julie version. So, it was great to search and find this reissue of an old album. Nothing else seems to be out there from Julie. The 'Magic Wasn't There' track is the best on the CD. In general the tracks are OK but the 'voice' overcomes the material. Hearing something fresh (even if it is 28 year-old fresh ) from Julie is fantastic. The purity and clarity of her singing remains unique!"
1,weak,This book lacks color and detail. The real San Diego book was done by photographer George Ross Jezek. This is a knockoff of his ideas. Shame on you
5,Fun for the kids and the adults!,I borrowed this book from the library because my daughter loves animals and it looked like a fun bedtime book. We weren't disappointed! I just took the book back yesterday after having it for six weeks and I think my daughter will be getting it for her birthday!This book outlines a day on a farm--the farmer goes off to town and leaves the house unlocked. Eight animals decide to make themselves at home while the farmer's cat watches disapprovingly. The biggest appeal for my daughter (almost 5) was the singsong approach a lot of the story seemed to take. She now knows it by heart and recites it all the time! The clocks placed throughout the story have taught her a lot about telling time (an added bonus). We love reading the book to her because the story just flows so well and gets both child and parent(s)giggling.This is a good wholesome book for pre-schoolers/early grade school children that would be a welcome addition to any home!
2,very simple,"I'm sorry for my English but after I red this book I had a feeling that the author tried to teach java and not OO or patterns at all. Too simple for a medium level java programmer with a OO know-how.Too simple to start to learn java too (the author stated ""there are other books to learn java"" but, the facto, he try to do this along many chapters).Good book to start for a novice in OO."
1,bad quality,"The ring is very different and I liked it until after a week it broke at the bottom of the band in the middle. I had worn it three times. Seems its bad quality and I guess it always goes back to you ""get what you pay for"". Needlesss to say I will not be purchasing from silverspeck again."
4,Good book,Very worn out but it helped a lot. Needed this book for philosophy and i found this book to be very helpful. It also influenced the way I look at knowledge.
5,Great.,"Bought this book for a philosophy class. Is translated very well and is pretty easy to understand. Overall, great book."
1,igot_whatuwant,Never order it from igot_whatuwant. it has been over a month and i have yet to receive my order. I already filed a claim.
3,Comprehensible Philosophy,"I had to buy this book for a freshmen philosophy course, five years later I decided to read it cover to cover and see what all the real fuss was about.First off, between the back-and-forth of Socrates and the excellent translation by Grube, this book is much easier to read then many other philosophy texts (most notably, Descartes). I am not going to argue the logic of the book here, but since most of it is repetitive questions, use of analogies, and point-counterpoint, I found this very easy to follow and understand. I would reread sections mainly to see the the delicacy of the argument, not because certain concepts were too philosophical and hard to grasp.All the same, it's five books on philosophy, though the bulk of the text is Phaedo, so you have to be in the mindset to read that material."
4,Good fun for younger children,"My two-year old girl loves this game. Its easy and you don't have to be able to read to play it. Fans of the book will find it a great follow up...the child will be able to easily match up the pieces, and it provides good educational skills whilst being fun at the same time."
4,Great first board game!,"My almost 3 yo received this for her 2nd birthday. We have read her the book since birth-and she took to the first few versions of the game right away. She enjoys playing almost all of the versions, now. There are 1 or 2 versions that she has tried, but is not successful with yet (they are rated for 4 or 5+ yo). It is great because it grows with your child's memory development. You can progress ahead to the next level whenever your child is ready-but, the first few versions they suggest are excellent for 2 yo kids. What a fun way to learn to wait your turn while someone else plays (and each turn is VERY short for the adults, so they don't have to wait long at all)."
2,For very young only,"I have to agree with other reviewers that this game is really aimed at very young children, and is much too simple for the older ages stated on the box. It is a good starter game for a toddler, especially if they love the book. But much older than 3 or 4 and they will be bored, even with the game variations. The game creators seem to have a low opinion of the brains and ability of preschoolers and early elementary children if they think that this game will keep them interested. For the money, I can't really recommend this game - you won't use it for very long."
3,A better game for 2 to 4 yrears,"We bought this game for my five year old daughter because she really likes the Good Night Moon book, she said it was too boring and doesn't like to play. I think it's a really cute game, but probably better for 2-4 yrs, rather than 2-6 yrs as listed for the age limit."
3,Pretty fair,"I love that they have a variety of different game options contained in one game. I'm disappointed that this seems to be for younger aged children then specified. My son just turned 3 in December and there really isn't much of a challenge for him. He loves the Goodnight Moon book so we thought this would be a fun gift that would challenge him and encourage his cognitive learning, however, it fell short of the mark as far as we were concerned. It is a cute game but for a younger child."
2,My kids were instantly bored,We love the book in our house so I assumed this would be a GREAT game for the kids. We have played it twice and the second time I could tell the kids were not interested in playing. Pretty boring and disappointing for the $18 or so I paid for it.
4,Goodnight Moon Game,"The Goodnight Moon board game is pretty, artwork appealing to children who love the Goodnight Moon book. The game is not expensive, and is developmentally appropriate for pre-reading children, helping in developing visual skills. My two year old granddaughter likes it, and quickly learned the principle of ""taking turns"" as we completed matching small cards to the large picture cards. The game, although fun for a very young child, is fairly limited. Older children will probably not be very interested in it, once they are able to read, other games will be more fun."
4,Great Book !,It's one of R.L.Stine's best.I enjoyed it immensly.Like all other guys I too wanted to murder Al (stupid idea though).The ending was not surprising cause I had guessed it already.
3,it kept me reading,"The book was quite good,i never thought the killer would be....... it wasn't scary but i carried on reading it to see what happened.the ending was very suprising,but frankly R.L .Stine ,you could have done better.sorry to anyone who thought it was good"
3,TRUTH KILLS YOU,is an ok book but like every time you read one of his books you know whats going to happen or you might have an ideai read this book but only part of it because i lost it but its not his best
4,Not bad... but not too exciting.,"I liked it. But i didn't love it. R.L.stine has done better. I suggest ""the halloween party"" if you want to see a good book. the goosebump books are really good too. This book was predictable and boring. UNEVENTFUL throughout most of the book. The good parts were here and there, there was some good parts. But i have read better from R.L. Stine and this is not one of his best. Don't let the awsome cover decive you."
4,"Kind of Corny, but Good Message","This book is good for a guy who hunts ducks or a woman who keeps a .38 in her nightstand but who never really gave thought to practical application of the Second Amendment. It has it's corny spots, but overall a good ""message"" book for an America that needs to understand the Bill of Rights now more than ever. If you are Libertarian, this is the book for you. If you are Moderate get it, but you might not take it too seriously. If you're a Conservative you'll find yourself smiling alot. If you're Liberal, and anti-gun, be ready for heavy introspection, and headaches because this book questions many assumptions that anti-gun folks of all shades take for granted."
2,Message got put before the story,"There's nothing necessarily wrong with a novel having a message. Some of the classics (1984, Animal Farm) and most (all?) of Smith's do. But this one put the message ahead of the storyline. Some of the more preachy bits seem pretty contrived, e.g. overhearing a black father and son discussing a white policeman's reactions when they approached him to ask for directions."
1,A fantasy clothed in the appeal of self-rightousness,"As with most of those who quote the Second Amendment, the authors conveniently omitted the first part of sentence. And in doing so, destroyed any validity to their arguments. The chapter containing the discussion between the Chapmans was so contrived, it read more like a teacher talking to a class room of students. A real John Greenwood would not have been 'turned' so easily, he would have experienced more anguish than we were shown. In an attempt to copy the style of Robert Heinlein's juvenile novels, the authors just trashed one of the very best science-fiction writers. Zelman & Smith wrote a book on a teenager's level so their readers would understand their intend. This was the level to which they had to appeal. This was a waste."
3,The Mitzvah--Perfect for a Cross-County Flight,"I am conservative with my ratings thus the three stars, I would require a book to be of classic stature before I'd award five. This book effectively uses a plot to illustrate the principles involved in the basic human right to personal weapons of deadly force. It was a fun read and quick enough for a cross-county plane journey. I would very much recommend this book, esp. over such lilting sentimental garbage as appears typically on Oprah's list."
5,"Buy two copies, give one to a Jewish friend!","This is a very valuable book that should be required reading in all high school social science classes. It covers a vital chapter in Jewish history which Charlie Schumer and Diane Feinstein would prefer you didn't know about: what free and armed Jews are capable of! This book also helped dispel some of my own personal ignorance of the Jewish religion. The writing is not superlative, but overall it's a good read. I plan on buying a dozen copies and giving them to all of my pseudo-liberal Jewish friends who sadly think that guns are abhorrent."
3,A Primer for the Unwashed,"This book, while shocking to liberals, is fairly mild to a pro-gun libertarian. And for that reason, it appeared to be written for the former rather than the latter. The book continually brings up snippets of history with the twist of a Paul Harvey's ""The Rest of the Story"" segment. The reader might he heard to say, ""Oh, so that's why the Jews didn't resist the Nazis...""The book drops names, book titles, authors, philosophers and the like in an apparent effort to serve as a bibliography for future research by the reader.At 245 pages is is a light read. The book's relatively small size would make it an excellent stocking stuffer."
4,gators headset covers,"These things are very nice, the only negative is I drive an infiniti, and they dont cover the headrest fully. I cant stretch them enough to tighten them underneath, otherwise they are awesome for a GATOR fan!"
4,Razah and Fourth Disciple,"This a very underrated Cd. The production is one point and the lyrics are A+. Some of the stand out tracks include: Who Gonna Die Next, Article One, and One Harmony."
3,good underground hip-hop,"The only thing I can say about this album is that its too drawn out. There's like 5 or 6 tracks at the end of the album that aren't produced by 4th Disciple, that I think should have been left out of the album. If an album is credited to a producer, why include tracks not produced by them? Overall the production is great, 4th Disciple always comes with it. And lyrically, Hell Razah steps up to provide memorable verses and catchy choruses. I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be, but anyone who really likes Sunz Of Man(1st album) will like this one too."
3,Not the Ones in Starbucks,"This is a higher quality chamomile tea than, say, Celestial Seasonings but is NOT the one they sell at Starbucks. Beware. This is a dried, chopped tea with a different recipe and different amounts of ingredients than the same label at a Starbucks, and the tea is in ""filterbags."" Just look at the ingredient list to see. I don't know why Tazo sells this; it's confusing and piggybacks on the reputation that the beautiful whole leaf teas with their intense flavor have. If you want the ones from Starbucks, order Tazo ""full leaf"" teas which are something like a dime more per bag; well worth it."
5,Remarkable,"I had my first cup of this tea last week at a restaurant. I simply wanted a cup of hot tea and asked the waitress to choose one for me. I cannot believe I am writing a review about a tea bag but it was outstanding. The blend of flavors and the aroma were individually wonderful. The name ""calm"" is insanely accurate. I was so relaxed after sipping my cup that I felt like curling up for an afternoon nap. I commented at the table how incredible the blend tasted. I am honestly stunned by this product - after all, one would think ""it's just a cup of tea"" ... but's its much more!"
5,Most excellent!,This is quite simply my favorite tea! Although I much prefer the loose tea to the bags- it is so convenient to be able to carry them around!
1,Pricing?,Is this the price for one box of tea? It is less expensive at Whole Foods and even less than that at HEB. I just wanted to check to see if this is the price for just one box of tea.
3,Drying,"Glad to find a product that is phthalate-free, but this is quite drying and made my son's skin dry, even though he doesn't usually have dry skin. Certainly shouldn't be used on children with dry or eczema-prone skin. Strong orange scent too -- smells like Orange Crush, which we don't mind but some people might not care for!"
3,Not great for a shampoo,"I love the way the product smells, however, it doesn't work well as a shampoo for my son's curly hair. The foam is a nice feature, though."
5,Highly recommended as an educational gift for young adults,"Wholesome Heroes with Rick Sowash: Johnny Appleseed is a documentary about the American frontier legend who traveled far and wide, planted apple trees, and spread a message of hope and faith. Johnny Appleseed remains a beloved folk hero to this day, but what was he truly like? Did he really go barefoot, or wear a pot on his head? Viewers ages eight to adult are sure to enjoy this fascinating portrait of a brave and good-hearted American pioneer. Wholesome Heroes with Rick Sowash: Johnny Appleseed is highly recommended as an educational gift for young adults, as well as for public and school library DVD collections. 28 minutes."
1,You can't always judge a book by its table of contents.,"I was looking for an introductory book on XML and decided to pick up a copy of Mastering XML after reading the introduction and perusing the table of contents. The book covers a great deal of topics, but almost all of it is poorly explained and most of the examples are not very illustrative of the related material. The author tends to describe things in a round about way and has a habit of throwing in material that isn't covered until later in his explanations. I tried reading ahead in some cases, but those sections weren't covered any more clearly so it turned into a vicious cycle. I finally had to stop reading after 400 pages. I have a background in web development with HTML, JavaScript, Java servlets, and JSP, but I would not recommend this book as a first on XML. It might serve as a reference though."
3,Alittle too Broad,"This book is a good starting resource for anyone who's concerned with their time on the Internet, or sex addiction in general. There's only a couple of problems I've had with the book. Mostly, it's catagorizing of addiction seems exceptionally broad. I think any normal person could argue they had an addiction problem using the criteria listed within.Also, the book is titled breaking free, but seems reluctant to assist in that endeavor. Instead, it throws out a few common sense ideas, and then recommends you seek professional help. Well, if that's what you're looking for, let me save you the cost of this book. ""You, are in need of professional help. A book cannot help you."" There, the overall morale of this title in one easy, free sentance."
5,This book covers it all,"As the spouse of an internet-porn addict,this book explained exactly how I felt and helped me to understand how my spouse felt when he was trapped in the Net. The best part about this book is the explanation of how the difficult journey to freedom will be worth more than the temporary and ultimately devastating ""high"" that users are addicted to. It also shows users how this seemingly harmless pastime can lead users to become someone they don't know or never thought they could become-doing things that stand against their own moral standards. It is brilliant."
3,This book was somewhat helpful,This book was somewhat helpful. I definitely think it helped solve some of our problems.
2,Trying to save the job for financial planners,"The not so funny style of this book does offer some valuable insights in to how to set the goals and what ratings of mutual funds mean. But the whole idea revolves around the basic premise how to prove that a finacial planner or a broker is important for you and without them nothing can be achieved. Whether it is the reliability of online calculators, financial software, no load funds or index funds, all Rick Edelman does is try to emphasize that an individual investor is not so smart and will get burnt unless supported by a Financial Planner. No wonder most the testimonials on the back cover come from Financial planner associations and similar agencies."
4,build your wealth,"As usual , Rics casual writing style presents practical wisdom on creating wealth. This volume completes my Ric Edelman librry. If I had started reading his books sooner I would be wealthy by now."
1,Nothing new,"Not bad but not worth reading. You'd be better off with a book about setting your life goals--try anything by Cheryl Richardson--and a good book on picking mutual funds--like the Wall Street Journal guides. He's just jumping on the bandwagon that other personal finance authors created a while ago by trying to tie goal setting with financial stuff, and doing it worse than they did. Big 'Duh!' factor in this book. And when will he learn that all his footnotes aren't funny, they're arrogant and annoying?"
4,Discovering the wealth to discovering your self,"A wonderful book to help you open your eyes to what life can be all about besides the obligations.Discover the Wealth Within You goes beyond offering the financial advise most of us can very well use. It's message is about discovering yourself by taking the time to ask yourself what you really want out of life.Throughout this book, Ric Edelman shows you how to set goals and achieve the things you've always wanted to experience, but never had the guts to persue because you never knew where or how to begin and/or questioned how realistic your goals were.I would recommend Ric's newest book, Discover the Wealth Within You, to all of those who are searching for a more rich and fulfilling life."
2,Very little concrete information,"I enjoyed ric's other book ""The truth about money"", and decided to purchase this book as well. Firstly, for someone who is looking for a tactical plan and something i can excute upon, this books provides very little help. Only the last few chapter provided some relevant information, the rest of the book was focusing on the inspire readers to invest, not exactly what i looking for. Secondly, a lot of the information is a rehash of the truth about money. I do like ric like a financial advisor, but wouldn't recommend this book"
5,Put More Fun In Your Life,"Edelman's new book, ""Discover the Wealth Within You,"" tries to get the reader to move beyond typical goals such as funding retirement, buying a home, and sending a child to college. I went through several of his exercises, and am now planning two adventures that I had previously only dreamed about. He also tries to get people to see Morningstar as a much more valuable resource than just using their star rating system to select mutual funds. The book is certainly worth the money for anyone who needs some solid suggestions on how to put more fun in their life."
4,Actually Digitally Remastered,"I just bought this this morning at the local drug store for $3.99. It has a great picture and wonderful sound. I don't know what these other reviewers are referring to, but the edition I purchased is quite a bargain."
1,Can remastering make movies worse?,"As the other reviewer mentioned, these are some terrific movies. Unfortunately, I just suffered through a terrible transfer of ""Charade,"" an old favorite, and began watching ""His Girl Friday,"" another wonderful movie with an equally bad transfer job. It is almost as if this company went out of their way to find the worst VHS copies they could, and did a direct copy onto DVD. Shocking that they can get away with claiming that they have done remastering. I once again have made the mistake of thinking that Costco previews the products they sell in their stores. It is worth doing the research to find low-cost, but improved transfers."
2,"Wonderful, through a different lens --","This is a nice selection of films. Unfortunately, the transfers are deplorable, rather bleary/blurry. And that's a shame. The company should be penalized for putting such a worthless product on the market."
4,Great but falls apart,"Star Trek: Encyclopedia 5.0 is a very good piece of reference material and include all data relating to Star Trek. It has partial listings of the alien cultures, the planets, and Federation Starships. The expanded area includes all recent data including Season 7 of DS9 the 9th movie and midway through Season 5 on Voyager. At the end of the book their are a few intresting things such as size relation of a few Federation ships, size relation of a few alien ships, a Star Trek Universe timeline, the making of Star Trek timeline, a list of all of the Episodes of TOS, TNG,DS9, the 9 movies, and all episodes to the end of Season 5 on Voyager. The only flaw is that the book falls apart very easily. If I where you I would get the hardbound copy or the Computer version."
5,A to Z all things Star Trek,"I really enjoy this encyclopedia. It was worth the wait! (It took 3 weeks for this book to reach me, since I live so faraway). But as I opened the first few pages.. I couldn't help going on reading for hours! (and I was reading an Encyclopedia! :) )"
5,Trekkies Rejoice!,"I bought this for my husband (then boyfriend) about four years ago. Since then, he has turned me into a Trekkie. This book is WONDERFUL for proving who's right when we get into a discussion about an episode, and it's so easy to read! Not like an ordinary Encyclopedia, this one is actually readable, and an entertaining read, too! A MUST for any Trekkie!"
3,Almost new,"The book came quickly and had never been used, just as I ordered. But there was a huge black sharpie mark on the top of the pages. It didn't effect what was on the page, but giving it as a gift I was pretty disappointed. When it said new it shouldnt have had that."
2,OK if you ignore obsolecence,"Nothing on the end of Voyager's Delta Quadrant wanderings? Nothing on Enterprise's backstory additions and newly-created anachronisms? Both this book and the related Star Trek Chronology need serious revamping. I appreciate the Okuda's insider Trekker style, but this reeks of willful blindness!"
5,Star Trek Encyclopedia - Revised edition (1999),"Love everything Star Trek. I could've spent $100 on this and still reflect a cost-effective purchase (ie, the hours of entertainment provided therein). If you find even an almost-better-than-passing interest in anything Star Trek, this reference will exacerbate your budding addiction."
5,"Excellent reference, needs to be updated!","Absolutely outstanding work. Well researched and documented, with some humorous asides. My only wishes are that it be updated soon to reflect the last seasons of Voyager, and that they integrate the updates in with the rest of the book. It's extremely frustrating that the last time it was updated the editors were lazy and simply stuck the new information on the back of the book."
1,Kindle version is NOT a new book...,I was hopeful that the encyclopedia would have updated information and be a great way to look up info.The book lacks even the most basic navigation features. It is less useful than a PDF version. I hope that they Simon and Schuster will update this at some point but I will be returning this (if I can) and certainly not keeping it on the Kindle. It was quite a disappointment.
4,Great source of general STAR TREK knowledge,"The Star Trek Encyclopedia is a very good quick-reference A to Z guide for those times when you need general knowledge of the various shows & movies, characters, equipment, vessels, aliens, and more. Not only will it help the average geekin' Trek fan-boy bone up on his knowledge, it's also a wonderful resource to help put an end to most of those knock-down, drag-out Trekkie arguments that often pop up in the middle of the big convention! Well, maybe not that Khan/Chekov debacle in `Star Trek II', but you can't have everything!Although it's fairly pricey, the book is printed on semi-slick paper, and includes full-color photos & illustrations. Because of these two things, and other stuff that makes this trade-size tome a higher-quality Star Trek book than usual, I think it's more than worth the asking price!`Late"
5,Exelent book!!!,"This book has just about everything about Star Trek. It has information on EVERY event, character and ship in Star Trek history. Outstanding book!!!"
5,This Is The Best Reference Guide For Star Trek Yet!,From 'Audet 9 to Zytchin 3 the Star Trek encyclopedia has everything about Star Trek in it. It is the Best Book I have Ever owned.I strongly suggest it.
4,Great book!,To put it in short- the best Trekkie encyclopedia there is.I just love those biographies on important characters.
5,Mr. Okuda !!..please update the info at Warp Speeeeed!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There is an ambiguos feeling buying this encyclopedia...you get amused considering all the gathering info and the format in which it is displayed, but there's also a feeling that living to date, in 2009 (one year before Arthur C Clarke's 2010 !) the value of the mentioned info is, unfortunately, outdated !!.So, if you love Trek and can live with the above explained introduction..go ahead..buy it, as I did (I bought it just last week. I waited and waited in getting a more updated encyclopedia to be release..but I got really tired ! and decided to buy it).Sumarizing I can only add to my review this: Mr. Okuda we need and update at warp speed 10.1 !!!!!!!!!Hope you find this review useful!"
4,"Great, but alittle outdated!","This was the greatest book other than the bible, but that was in 1999. It's 2004 and I want an update. Their so much that has happened since and it won't even include all the books written."
3,"Good, but...","Hi! I am from Italy. I have bought ""Star Trek Encyclopedia"" and I like it very much, but this book stops at 1999: it is not updated whith last Voyager's seasons (fifth, sixth and seventh), the whole Enterprise's cycle and ""Star Trek: Nemesis""."
3,Are those pictures?,"This, the nth edition of this classic compendium of Trek lore, is the ultimate argument-ender for Trekkies. I have an older print edition of this work, but I recently invested in the updated Kindle version, and enjoy its excellent, comprehensive text content as always, but the tiny, pixelated and streaky pictures are a waste of space."
5,A Trekkie Must Have,"There were so many facts in this book. A book with every single charector, equiopment, episode, and important event from every single series is just what a trekkie needs. Each entry explains which episode and series it is from, and there a bunch of notes in italics explaining how something was done. I fully recomend this book. It has entries from ""surprise pary"" to the ""dominian war."" And if there was a flaw in time and a charector was duplicated they had a seperate entry on that charetor. How could a trekkie not have this book?"
5,Read this Now!!!!!!!!!,"I am a Trekker. This reference guide the future is substantial to the Star Trek franchise. The color pictures add a feature, which are great. The new information helps with ever changing Star Trek universe. The chart of the Defiant on p.109 is magnificent. My cousin's friend gave it to me and I always look at it before I go to sleep at night. The biographies on the characters are great as well. This is a complete comprehensive book on Star Trek Star, Trek the Next Generations, Star Trek DS9, and Star Trek: Voyager."
1,DO NOT BUY- PAST DUE DATE,"Don't waste your time on buying this book. Its copywrited 1999, which means all of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" is missing. There is NO plans to update this book, its missing information on several of the ""Star Trek"" movies including the new one so save your money.I would NOT have purchased this had I known its publishing date."
1,Don't buy this CD !!,"Recently I bought the double CD ?Star Trek Encyclopedia 3.0? from the catalog of Amazon.com.The installation CD doesn't work, the setup.exe doesn't start up.I see that the installation procedure is from 1997 ? That's prehistoric and 13 years old !!The minimum operating system version is Windows 95 ? They never heard of 2000, XP, Vista or 7 ?I'm working with Windows XP SP3 and I can't use this at all.Even when I try to copy manual some files, I get errors while copying.I viewed some pictures and movies but they are really extreme low res and low quality.So I'm totally not pleased with this delivery. I send a mail to [e-mail address removed] but no answer yet.I asked for a solution.Or they send me a working versionOr they pay me back the amount of 36,37 ?Or they send me the book version of this album."
3,Average PC,"Pro:PriceProcessor is okNVIDIA graphicsCon:Battery goes bad quicklyVarious software bugs crash computer oftenThis an affordable option if you don't mind buying a battery. I ended up giving this to my son who seems happy with his experience (16yrs). The processor is fast enough to run the internet and other mass software packages. Multitasking isn't painful with the 3gb of ram. If you are storing lots of pictures and stuff like that, then pass for something that has a larger hard drive."
1,Keep Looking,"I've had this laptop for a little over a year and I wish I had saved my $1500. I've never written a review on Amazon, but after it finally croaked completely I felt obligated to.When I first received this computer, it didn't work. I had to contact HP to order recovery disks. After running the disks the computer did run.About a month ago, the screen would begin to go black and freeze periodically. Again, this laptop is a little over a year old. The screen issue began to be more frequent. I took it to an HP service provider. He told me the hard drive may need to be replaced ($200 parts & labor) or the mother-board would need to be replaced (approx $800 parts & labor). I went the cheaper route and guess what - it didn't fix the issue. So, since I am not forking over another $800, the laptop is junked.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING"
5,For anyone in the sun,"I build and shoot rockets. This means I spend time in large fields or deserts with very little or no shade. I am also completely bald. If you don't want to mess with sunscreen, this hat is perfect. It is light weight and the white color reflects the sun's rays. The neck shield is button snapped and protects the back of the head and around the neck.I don't no about style, nor do I care. This hat is functional."
1,Horrible,"I bought this item since Panasonic generally makes quality products. I also liked the idea that it used external AA batteries. However, the product only worked twice for me then died. I unfortunately had thrown out the box before I knew it needed to be returned."
4,Great item.,Great quality to cut nose hair. One thing I noticed about light is not point to inside of nose hole. It doesn't look like adjustable.
1,Very Weak Motor!!!,"I have used this trimmer off and on for the last few years. It worked ok the first few times, but then the motor began to loose it's power to the point where it doesn't spin at all. I replaced the battery and it made no different. Very weak product in my opinion."
3,Panasnic nose and ear hair trimmer,"The panasonic product looks good on paper, but it has already has quit working twice in the few months that I have owned it. I have to hit it on something to get it to start working again. Don't buy this one folks."
2,Would not buy it again,Very cheaply made. The light is useless because it does not shine where you need it and the top is falling apart pretty quickly.
2,No thanks,Worked well but stopped working after 10 months. The cutter started making a grinding sound because it was rubbing against the guard. I ordered a Norelco this time round.
1,WORST EVER!,I bought this thinking it was the replacement for the discontinued excellent Panasonic ER411 that I had for many years. Panasonic changed the blade height on this newer ER421 model so that it does not cut close at all. I also thought the small LED light would be helpful and it doesn't even aim straight (pointless). I purchased the Mangroomer trimmer this week from Amazon and it works flawless just like the old Panasonic ER411 did. Don't waste your money on the Panasonic RE421 series.
3,OK But doesn't cut the hairs close enough,I have used the product several times and I would prefer that it allow you to cut the nose hairs closer. Although I recognize this is a safety issue I still would prefer it not have this feature.
4,Very Good,This is a good nose trimmer. Much better than the Conair. The only drawback is it is a little difficult to cut the shorter hairs in the front of nose. The light is good too.
1,Piece Of Junk,"Bought this model as an upgrade to the older panasonic model. Had to keep on replacing batteries on the older model so I threw that one out and purchased this model. I only use it for my nose and don't use it that often but once again, I have gone through several batteries and now it will not work at all with a brand new battery. I never got it wet or dropped it. It just stopped working after about 5 months. And mind you, I don't use it everyday so it's not like it's burnt out or anything. And don't get me started on the light. It's just a complete waste. Do not waste your money!"
2,Good if it would last,"Got this for my husband for Christmas. He used it once, then the motor burned up. He liked how it felt, but it's a little ridiculous to only be able to use it once. Unfortunately he tossed the packaging, so I can't return it."
1,Tears not cuts!,"These other reviewers were right! I should have listened to them! This trimmer's motor is so weak, that half your nose hairs are yanked out rather than cut off! This trimmer will bring tears to your eyes!!! The trimmer's light is weak and rather pointless since you can't see where it's shining anyway! Don't buy this! Run away, now!!!"
1,Did not work properly upon receipt,"The product did not work properly upon receipt. The motor appears to be frozen, and will only work sporadically if I shake the unit to free it up. And after a few seconds of working, it will again freeze up."
3,Good little trimmer,It's a good little trimmer. It has all the power necessary to rid yourselfof those pesky little hairs. Easy cleanup. The light isn't necessary but maybe if vision is a problem. Would recommend.
1,Panasonic nose clipper doesn't...,The Panasonic nose clipper does not have enough power to clip anything. I had to return it. This is the second one I've had.No More.
1,JUNK,"This thing worked for about 10 minutes. Literally just stopped. Changed batteries, on-off, waiting, on-off. NOTHING. It simply died. Worthless."
4,Works fine,The trimmer works fine and is handy. The light doesn't serve much purpose!The only problem is the rotary blade doesn't cut deep enough. My old conair trimmer had a straight blade and used to cut just close enough.Overall works decently!
2,avoid this trimmer,"I've had this trimmer for probably 2 years now, and never much cared for it. I suppose it gets the job done but it always seems like the battery is about to die, even with a brand new one in it. It tends to pull hairs out somewhat too rather than just cut them like it ought to. The light is a joke, since it's aimed directly down the barrel (though to be fair, all trimmers seem to do this - don't ask me why they don't aim off to the side so you can see what you're doing while using it). Anyway something that should be a no brainer product is just poorly executed. Find better."
2,Functions poorly,This little device works poorly. It takes a lot of effort to get it to clip hairs. I am quite disappointed. It's much worse than an earlier Panasonic unit I used for 5 yrs. or so. Avoid it.
2,Panasonic Nose & Ear Trimmer,I have two over ten years. One and one but not with light.It works but makes my eye run when its pulls the hair and makes me deaft whenusing it in the ear. So just go back to the good old seaser and smile.
1,DON'T PURCHASE,IT DOES PULL YOUR HAIRS AT TIMES AND THE LIGHT SHINES EVERYWHERE BUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING.. THE UNIT SUCKS.
2,owwwwwww!,"just kidding, no blood yet, but the cracking noise it makes freaks me out, especially when its in my nose."
5,I bought it as a Christmas Gift for my dad!,"I bought it as a Christmas Gift for my dad! I don't know if it works, or not, sorry."
1,Worst nose hair trimmer I've ever owned,"Okay, sad though this is, I just got the package. Opened it in great excitement, since my previous trimmer died a week ago and I've missed it.Oh how disappointed I was to try it. Bluntly, it sucks. Waste of my $15 or whatever it cost. I'd return it if it was (1) returnable and (2) worth the hassle."
3,OK but not great,It works OK but I wish I could find one that is real heavy duty. I guess I want an industrial strength nose and ear hair clipper. This one is like all the others in that they (the people that make them) worry that you might get a hair yanked now and then. Well my good old Dad didn't raise any sissies and I just want one to cut like my old cheap Norelco. Side to side not in a circle. The only ones that trim side to side now are the cheepos from the chi comm's (Chinese Communists). But his one does have a nice cushy handle for easy grip and is very quiet. It does however take awhile to trim the difficult ones and is hit and miss on the problem ones.
3,works ok,"This is nothing to ""write home about"" It works ok, but not really any better than the $5 cheapo model from just about anywhere."
2,Try a different model,"I've used this trimmer a few times and it pulls a lot. I have an old Connair el cheapo and it does the trick without pulling - the only concern is that I can smell burning when I use it which is why I got another one. I'll stick to scissors for now until I find a trimmer that works properly.I had this product for about eight months before it died on me. When it was working it was quite painful to use, often pulling and tearing away the nose hairs. The light was absolutely pointless. It was better than the Connair I had prior to it whose motor you could smell burning as you used it. I can't believe how few choices there are for trimming nose hair and how useless they are."
2,Not a good product,This trimmer yanks my nose hairs quite frequently and battery runs out very fast. Wouldn't recommend it. I'm back to using scissors until I find a better trimmer than this Panasonic one.
2,Not the energizer bunny!,I purchased this a year and a half ago. I've used it several times since then. It's never had much power but with patience can be used to get the job done. The light is a joke. A magnifying mirror with good vanity mirror lighting is better. I went to use it a week ago and discovered it doesn't run. Even with a brand spanking new Eveready battery. I do not recommend this particular model. My previous trimmer worked for years and years before it died.
3,I was expecting more power.,"It's a nose/ear hair trimmer, and it does what it says. I don't understand the light attachment. But I was expecting the motor to have more power considering it's an AA battery powering it. It does pick at my hairs from time to time instead of just cutting them, but it definitely beats plucking each one the old school way!"
2,Works if it works,"I agree that the light feature is totally useless and is probably Panasonic's method of differentiating a more expensive model. On the positive side it did a good job of nose and ear trimming. On the negative side, it stopped working after about 8 months. I owned a Panasonic previously and it too died after about a year. No more Panasonics."
1,Junk! Died after one year.,"This trimmer died after one year of light use. And it didn't do that great of a job in the first place. Don't let the ""best selling"" reputation of this item fool you."
4,Works great before you drop it!,"This is my second one and it works great. I would recommend this product whole nosedly. It also works well on trimming any ear hair you may sticking out. Prior to the Panasonic ER421KC I had the Panasonic ER112BC which worked well, but vibrated some and tickled my nose, no such issue with this model.Just don't drop it cutter end down. Unfortunately, I did and broke the plastic cap that holds the blades on the first one. I was able to hold it on and continue use, but this was not practical, so I bought a new one.4 Stars because of the lack of durability, 5 Stars for performance."
2,Mediocre at best,"I had good expectations for this product based on other reviewers, but I found it to be medicre at best. Not real strong power. Okay product, but I expected better."
5,Works fast and well,"I'm well pleased with this device. It took only two minutes to do the job. Yes, it will nip you if you're not careful, but the cure for that is simply to be careful."
4,Sor far so good !,"Brought it in Feb. 2008, and its been working fine till now. I've used it 3/4 times till Mar 2008.I was worried about the pulling of hair which some people mentioned, but mine didn't do that.oohh.. the smell of freshly cut nose hair 8-)"
3,Worked OK but the motor is gradually dying after about 30 uses.,"Was fine at first (light's sort of silly though), but the motor is winding down and so it turns slowly and is more of a hair puller than a hair cutter now. Probably just this unit, but I guess you get what you pay for and the price was cheap. Looks like decent quality for the price."
4,great product,"I love Amazon. I live in a remote area of Colorado that has very few stores so I use Amazon for hard to find items and my recent purchase was this nose hair trimmer. After much deliberation and doing probably too much research I purchased the Panasonic ER421KC nose and ear hair trimmer.It is exactly what I was looking for. I really did not want another cheaply made import because I have already thrown a few of those away and I kept on having to go back to my moustache scissors to get the job done, which at my age is a little dangerous.This trimmer takes a little getting used to but does a great job.I am always surprised at just how much hair it trims without pulling and the reservoir tip traps all of those small hairs which can then be easily rinsed out under running water. It has a very solid feel and is backed up by warranty. Of course, I recommend this product highly."
4,PANASONIC Ear Hair Trimmer,"Good product.Convenient and easy to use, it reaches those for hard to trim the nose and ears.Operates on battery, but the product is good.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002D5Y92/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,Felt Cheated,"Hello,I bought this product when I was on business visit to US. When i returned India and tried to use it, it never worked. Not once!! I felt cheated and bad. I will never buy any product made by Panasonic again.Arvind"
3,Adequate,"It works adequately, though it seems to eat batteries, and it's not as powerful as desired. The light is useless IMO. Still, the trimmer does the job."
2,"Great Updated Style, But at the Cost of Less Power and a Less Durable Blade","This Specific Trimmer from Panasonic was a Disappointing Purchase. The Trimmer Lasted About 5 Months of Very Occasional Use. The Blade on this Model is Veru Tiny, Fragile and of Poor Design. The Blade is What Led Me to Have to Buy Another Trimmer, Because it Became Slightly Out of Aligned with the Outside of the Trimer and Would Not Allow the Motor to Turn It. This Model Also Has a Poor Power Level which Made It Inefficient in Trimming Hair. I Replaced this Model with the Panasonic Model with the Squared Off Body, which is Shown it the Comparison Chart on the Product Detail Page for this Product. I Definitely Recommend that Model Over This One."
2,Worked well... then died,It worked well for about 15 months then died. New batteries didn't help. It just decided to quit working one day. I bought it because I bought it because I hoped the quality would be better then the cheap ones. But the cheap one I bought for 10 bucks 4 years ago still works.
1,Its a joke,it doesn't cut very close. It does not cut nose or ear hair at all. It was a complete waste of money!!!!!!
1,Panasonic ear trimmer,It worked terribly. Did not do the job. Even pinched my ear to some degree. Would never recommend this product to anyone.
1,Not worth the shipping,"It is ridiculously weak. It managed to cut the hairs but pulled at them like crazy - quite painful. Doubt it would last long either, but have no idea, since I haven't used it once since my girlfriend found some no-name cheapo (< $5) nose trimmer that works 20 times better than this.And yeah, the light is totally a gimmick, no way that could be useful."
2,Don't let the Panasonic brand name fool you...,"The light, presented as a great marketing feature,is useless except if you intend to use it to check the time on your watch during the night, while you're in bed.Performance is worse than most other similar, much cheaper trimmers with no great sounding brand names to entice you. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
1,Buy Wholesale Cheap send a used one! (works as advertised),"I received a USED, OPENED package today from the seller. Beware of this seller.The item did work as advertised."
1,"cheap design, doesn't work well","this thing works as if the battery is always low. it stops running and i have to tap it to get it going again. being lazy, i've lived with it for a year, but i've had enough - time to find something better. the light is pretty much useless, it doesn't shine where you are trimming."
1,Worked well--for a few weeks.,"This was my third trimmer in five years. It worked well for the first few weeks, although the light is almost worthless. I don't need a light to find my nose and once it is in there, the light has no value.I used the trimmer about once a week for two months. Then, it stopped working. I would bang it on a table and it would start again. After doing this for a month, it would not start again. I tried cleaning it several times and inserted a new battery to no avail.It is now in a landfill. Plan on these things being disposible. None have lasted more than 2 years."
2,Disappointing,"Not very happy with this one, but I've had worse. It's better than most, but still not very effective at the ONE thing it's supposed to do! I would not recommend getting it.PROS:- Well-built, hasn't broken in almost a year- Safe to use, no cuts or painful snags (yet)- Easy to clean (just run under a faucet)CONS:- Not very thorough- Underpowered, I've replaced the batteries with no improvement- Light is next to useless"
2,Don't drop it or it will break,"I had this for over a year and it did a fair job of trimming hair. However, I dropped it once (a distance of 2-3 feet) and it landed on its trimming end, denting the fairly fragile metal prongs that shield the blades. The blades would never spin correctly again, despite my attempts to straighten the metal. I would not recommend this unit as all it takes is one drop to put an end to it."
1,Not worth the money,"I had a very bad experience with this nose/ear trimmer and strongly recommend buying another brand/model.Here's why...1. The spinning razor kept jamming and, at times, stopping...the only way I could get it to work when this happened was to loosen the cover/tip of the trimmer and hold it in place with my fingers while it was operating.2. The light was worthless, as it wasn't positioned appropriately on the trimmer to be of any use3. It didn't cut hairs all that well and often pulled hairs instead4. At times, it was hard to take off the cover/tip of the razor to clean it out or adjust the flimsy parts inside to get it to work again.5. Ultimately, the trimmer fell apart and the razor broke off.I threw it away and will not be buying a Panasonic grooming product in the future again."
2,"nose, ear hair trimmer",It was not my favorite gift to give. It seemed to be cheaply made and pulls hair instead of cutting.
1,"broke in 4 months, panasonic denies problem under warranty","This think broke in less than 4 months. The blades just stopped turning, I did not drop the product or misuse it. Tried to work problem out with Panasonic, they told me that the problem is with the blades and the blades are not covered by warranty. They told me I could buy replacement parts for the trimmer. They tranferred me to the parts department to buy a new blade. I was on hold with the parts department, then when it finally rang through the line went dead. A complete waste of time and money on my behalf."
1,Plucked and blinded,The ER42KC plucked the hairs painfully out of my nose and the light shines closer to my eye than it does my nose. I wasted $15 down the drain. Don't buy it...trust me. There are others out there that are saying the same thing. My 15 year old ER112 works 100% better than this one.
3,"Very good, but not excellent","I am mostly happy with this product but there are some issues that keep it from being excellent.The speed of the motor is not as fast as I think it should be. This makes the cutting often seem more like pulling. Expect some watering eyes. I hoped this could be helped by adding fresh batteries but it didn't. Overall, it is a very good product that gets the job done extremely well, but with a few tears along the way."
4,Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer,My Husband says the Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer works quite well....with no possibility of cutting your nose or ear.
4,Good one,What can I say. It does the job and seems durable. My only complaint is the Led light is not aimed properly to see nose hairs. I dont really use that feature anyway.
3,"Works, but eats batteries","So it works. It cuts nose hair. The light makes it easier to see in there.That said, I only need to use it every couple weeks, and it drains the battery during that time--there's a big difference between a fresh battery and one that's been sitting in there for a while.The solution is easy, only put the battery in when you need to use it, but that's annoying. Hence, only 3 stars."
3,Not so satisfied,"I had a panasonic nose trimmer before and I think was a better product than this one. Overall, it is ok, but I would add a cover for protecting the tip. My old trimmer had a cover."
4,"If you're a hairy guy, get one.","I think this is a great little trimmer. I never had one before. Instead, I used to trim my nose and ear hair with a small scissors. But a small misstep left me wearing a band-aid in a somewhat embarrassing place. So I ordered this little puppy and it does a great job. I feel a little silly sticking it up in my nostrils, especially if my wife is around. She has a tendency to make fun of my technique, but she never complains about my grooming. My only reticence about the product is the power - sometimes I think if could use a little more. Then again, I'm not sure I'd want to put a stronger unit up my nose. I'm happy to recommend this unit. If you're a hairy guy, I highly suggest picking one up."
3,"Does the job, but have had better","Just a quick review....I have used another trimmer for a few years now and it did not seem to cut as well any longer. Since I was buying this as a gift for someone else, I decided to get a replacement for myself. Overall, the trimmer does the job. First, the good - the blades are sharp and actually cut the hair instead of pushing it to the side....but then again it is NEW. A few bad - light is not bright enough, blades do not spin fast enough (tried a few sets of batteries).Overall, this gets the job done and I am not sure how pleasant it should be to trim nose hair. I probably would not buy this item again even though it was a decent price. You can get a similar or better unit at any drug store."
2,Works only for a few months - design issue,"After a few months of use this didn't trim very well. Everything seems to work, but it doesn't trim.On inspection, the blade unit isn't rising up to the top, it stays low in meta guard. Cleaning with alcohol didn't help.I think the blade unit is supposed to rise up as it spins, lifting off the base rotor. This allows it to trim, while reducing the risk of cutting tissue. My guess is that with time it may fail to lift off.I don't like replacing things every few months. It's wasteful, not to mention annoying."
4,Works!,"Battery lasts, does what it is supposed to - trim nose and ear hairs. No pulling experienced so far."
4,"Excuse me sir, but you really need this device","Gentleman, if I have to have a meeting with one more college professor, economist, or scientist who looks as though they don't own a mirror--I am going to shoot myself. Enough is enough! Get this unit and trim your incredibly unattractive nose and ear hair. Honestly! And while your at it, get something to trim your darn eye brows. If you don't care enough about your appearance to do it for yourself, do it as a courtesy to others. Enough said I hope."
1,didnt work sent back,very disappointed Panasonic is usually very reliable has to send unit back did not work at all
1,wosrt trimmer ever,This has to be the worst nose hair trimmer I've ever used. It doesnt cut very well. Feels like its pulling instead of cutting.
1,Junk,I bought this when my Wahl brand died. Its stops intermittently and pulls my hair instead of cut. I never write reviews but this thing sucks.
4,Does the job,"This trimmer does the job. The little light is useless, however. The blade does not cut the hair off all the way, on purpose. It is probably as good as any you will find. I like that it is powered by an AA battery."
5,Works as described.,First time using one of these. So I don't know if your nostrils should hurt for a few days after. I'm assuming its from the newly cut hairs. No Big Deal. I'll live.
4,Good Product,I think this trimmer is much better than most of the more expensive ones. The light is useless but looks cool. I would recommend buying this at this great price.
1,This Was My Last Panasonic Nose/Ear Hair Trimmer Ever,"Every year I buy the new model hoping they fixed the flaws of the previous model, and the same problems keep happening over and over. The thing works great for a couple months or so then starts having these stop-and-go problems where you have to remove and adjust the blade piece (as if you are cleaning it) to get the thing going again at full speed...which it does for little while before slowing down again and starting to pull rather than cut....painful! This happens with even after replacing the batteries. I finally gave up and went to the Mangroomer nose/ear trimmer and will never look back"
1,"Not recommended, eats batteries and poor performance....","I was the happy previous owner of a Panasonic trimmer, hence the draw back to Panasonic. Unfortunately this one just doesnt ""cut"" it. Blade head is tool large to get fine hairs. Also it seems that every time I go use the trimmer I have to replace the battery. Oh and also the light (what light) is useless, except for the fact that it is just burnin up battery Im sure. Bottomline eats batteries, not fine enouh unfortunately not recommended...sorry to say...."
3,Gets the job done,But still manages to bring tears to my eyes when grooming the nasal area. Almost feels as though it's snagging and pulling your hairs out. Nothing beats a pair of sisors I suppose.
1,doesn't last very long,"I may have used this 5 times and it's already crapped out on me. There's not much else to say about a product that doesn't work. If I take the blade off, it spins, but it won't spin with the blade on. Tried changing batteries, cleaning, etc. Even when it did work, it wasn't that great. I'll be getting a different one."
3,worked well for a couple years,It worked well for a couple of years but then just wouldn't turn on. Changes the batteries out but nothing.
2,Not too bad,"Nothing special, I had better nose hair trimmers, and worse ones.I expected more from this one, being Panasonic, but it is rather mediocre."
2,Ouch,"Very painful. Blade catches. Not a lot of power. Don't understand the purpose of the light. The Panasonic ER112BC is way better. I had one of those for years, and loved it."
2,Trimmer Disappointment,"This trimmer just doesn't make the cut (hair cut that is). The light is a good idea, but it is really hard to remove hair with it."
3,Not as good as the prior model,"Old model died, so hubby decided to stick with panasonic. Like some of the other reviewers have stated, this one just doesn't cut as close as the old model, but it does seem to cut with less pull, so he says... Give and take I guess. He'll just have to use more often..."
4,Pretty good,"I have no trouble with the hair yanking or anything. I don't have thick hair, more like peach fuzz in my nose. I know it don't have a alotta power though. I don't know how long this shaver will last. Bought it based on reviews. Well, hope for the best!"
1,ineffective,"it was simply ineffective. we used to have a similar panasonic trimmer that worked great, but this one works so poorly, slow to cut, hard to figure out what angle you're holding the edge to cut the hair, and the light seems useless. it's something to throw away and try again."
3,More hype than results,"Even though the trimmer is soft and feels good to the touch in the nose and ear, it is limited in its scope of cutting some hair which is difficult access areas of the ear.Otherwise, it's comfortable and feels good."
4,trimming the hair you don't want,"generally works effectively in nose or ears, w/o pinching, though sometimes requires repeated applications."
4,Its a nose hair trimmer that works...,nuff said...not that good for ears...but maybe mine just are not hairy enough yet...lol..
4,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED GADGET,"Pesky nose hairs driving you crazy? Not to worry. This little gizmo trims them beautifully, then washes clean."
4,my review,Works fine for my needs. I like that it's small and compact. Easy to pack for a trip if i need to. Some are too big. So far it's lasted longer than others.
4,Good value for the price,Good product for the low price. Easy to use and very handy. Good product to gift. Have to use it to realize how easy it is
3,Decent trimmer,"The true test of a trimmer such as this is how well it holds up over the long haul, and it's difficult for me to assess that after having owned it for only a month or so. The one complaint I have at this point is that the light feature (which isn't all that important for overall performance) is angled improperly and is therefore of no use whatsoever."
2,Maybe I got a dud,"I've had this thing for many years and the first two times I used the nose trimmer it worked well but after the second time it seems to have a really hard time picking up speed when spinning the blade and keeping up speed. I have always cleaned it meticulously after every use and even tried different kinds of lubrication and batteries but it just works very poorly. I still have it and put up with it but it's very frustrating because it ends up pulling a lot of hairs because the RPM's intermittently drop which cause the blade to yank the hair instead of cutting it. Also, the LED light is completely worthless and you really have to wonder what engineer thought that would be a good idea."
2,light is a joke,"I thought the light feature would be a plus, but it's a minus. ave the loot and get a smaller one. It works, but the light shines in your eye and not in your nostril. I put a piece of tape over it."
4,Panasonic nose/ear hair trimmer,This item is for my husband. His comment was that he likes it very much and it is handy and easy to use.
2,I'm going back to the scissors,"I've been using this product for a few months now and I've decided that I'm going back to good-old scissors. For the first few weeks, it worked great. Then it started to pull hairs. I thought it might be the batteries, so I replaced them, but no dice. It doesn't exactly yank the hairs, so if you can deal with a bit of stinging, then it's not a big issue."
2,Panasonic could have done better,"Although this unit functions as described, I find it poorly designed. The light on the unit does absolutely nothing to assist in trimming hair in the target area. The light just shines all around my nose, it's somewhat comical! Lastly, there aren't enough slits in the head of the unit to allow hairs to enter the cutting area adequately. I would pick another brand without a light."
3,Can't Wait for the One With the Camera!,"The light on this machine is absolutely pointless.Now they have one with a vacuum.Pretty soon they'll market one that can text, take pictures and play music.Guys: Come up with a trimmer that works and lasts for more than just a few weeks."
5,Works great. Cheap. Does The Nasty Job...,Works great. Cheap. Does The Nasty Job...Nothing else to say.I needed to replace the one that I had which was not as good but also did the job. I dropped the top piece in my bathroom sink drain and couldn't get it out. Excuse to buy a new one...Bought one for a friend when I got mine who I've been sympathetically been after for years to get something to deal with his hairy ears and divining rod nasal hairs.Halleyulah.
1,"Worked, died, stank","My review is limited, unfortunately, to the results of one use.The first use it seemed to work reasonably well. It pulled a bit rather than cut as well as it should have, but it got the job done with minimal discomfort. Unfortunately, I recently grabbed it out of my closet to do some touch up and it would not turn on. No response. Totally dead. I popped open the battery cover and WHAM! I may not be trimming my nose hairs but I think I just burnt them off with that awful smell. The battery was fine and intact (no leaking or cracks) but the internal case smelled like a mixture of death, farts, and chemicals. In all seriousness it smelled STRONGLY of rotting organic compounds.I have yet to call Panasonic, but I sure plan on it."
2,Worked well until it didn't,"My fiance was amusingly excited to receive this as a gift. Two weeks after I gave it to him, he took it to England on a work trip. When he got back, he realized that something had happened in transit and it no longer worked. I haven't tried to return it because I don't know what the TSA people may have done to it... but I still think a product should be able to withstand some travel..."
1,Best Nose Hair Flashlight I Have Ever Had!,"This thing is great. Without it, I could never see all those hairs up there. Only problems are that the battery last for about 10 minutes, it doesn't cut hair, and it broke after a few months. Other than that, this is well worth the exorbitant price.Go Panasonic!"
2,Pana-sub-sonic,"Simply put, this product lacks speed. The blades don't move fast enought.It seems to take for ever."
3,Painless relative to other trimmers,This trimmer is quiter and seems to cut more thoroughly than other trimmers I've used -- although I haven't used all of them. I'm pleased with it so far.
1,Poor Quality,"The product The Panasonic nose trimer does not work, it hasn't the power to cut. I can't send it back because I threw away the shipping box and paper work. I have always recieved quality products from you in the past, and I didn't see a need to keep anything. A lesson learned.Theresa Denfeld"
2,Works Ok,"This works ok, but not like the trimmer I had before. It says it doesn't trim all the hairs, because it has a raised edge. This one uses a spinning blade, and the last one I used, was a real trimmer. It had two blades, that go up and down.It has a light, but I don't trim in the dark anyway. Why did they put a light on it, it drains the battery, and I can't remove the light."
4,The OKest,"I did some good research prior to buying this trimmer. I had the Sharper Image model prior to this one. This one seems to do the job, but seems a bit weak on power. I still haven't found a solid trimmer I like, but this one seems to do the job."
1,"it died. i got to use it maybe 3 times, kept it immaculate.","i owned this for maybe two months, had used it maybe 3 times, when i noticed that it wasn't working. i only use good batteries, but still, i put in a new one. nothing.get a groom mate. i just did, it works great, better than the battery operated ones, and, as a bonus, it doesn't have a motor to can out on you. or needing new batteries all the time. twist and turn it yourself, and you won't have to keep shopping for a damn nose hair trimmer. don't you have other things to do? i know i do. the groom mate is probably the fourth i will have owned. i don't see why i would ever need another, unless it came with a personal masseuse.better. by a landslide. check it:Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose & Ear Hair Trimmer"
3,Nose news,Trimmer works well but the light is useless. It's nowhere near pointed where it needs to be pointed and can be quite distracting.
1,waste of money,"Better buy other .. don't belive in users rating.This only good for nore hair. not for the hair on ear.Reason is simple. Its easy cut hair in nose just holding inside the nose, but for ear.. you need to chase the each hair strands with this tiny head."
1,Disappointed Item,"I ordered the nose groomer because we had a previous one that worked great, also from Panasonic. Unfortunately, this product didn't work at all!!! I ran out of time to send it back and now am stuck with it and out of $20.00. This is the first bad item I have ever received from Amazon. This product doesn't cut anything and seems to be broken. Will go to a store next time to buy an item like this."
5,Panasonic ER421KC Nose Hair Trimmer,"Had a Remington which only lasted so long, then did some research and the Panasonic ER421KC came out on top. The Remington was slow by comparison to the Panasonic. The Panasonic does not pull as you're not aware of it's cutting the nose hairs. It's a great product. I intend to buy another one and Amazon has the lowest price. Highly recommended to anyone who has to trim very often like myself."
4,"Good Trimmer, Mostly","Have had this trimmer for about one month. It works good, effective, doesn't pull the hair, cuts it cleanly. Gave it a 1 star reduction because it is supposed to have a light and the light one mine was inoperative on arrival. Not a big deal to me so I didn't try to return it, just shows a bit of a lack of quality control."
3,jcocktail,How excited can you be about a nose hair trimmer? It does its job and doesn't grab stray hairs. Good product.
1,Disappointed,The product is defective and I want my money back---did not function with batteries and is not working anyway whatsoever
2,died in 6 months,worked great at first but died within 6 months of use no matter what we do can't seem to get it going again
5,Works great and the light is helpful,Does just what you would think it should and does it well. The light is very useful but not when your trimming your hairs.
1,Junk,"Worked a few times, then stopped working. Do not buy this piece of junk, it works for a week and then bricks."
1,LIGHT IS WORTHLESS,"Probably worth more than one star, but the light is WORTHLESS. I could have gone to Walmart and bought a Philips Norelco with the same type rotary cutting head for $9.97. My order came to $21.21 for this Panasonic Nose Trimmer with shipping. Nothing like spending twice as much as I should have.I bought this model because a reviewer said the light was a nice addition. Don't fall out for that. The light is WORTHLESS in my opinion."
3,"Well designed, but for me, unusable ...","When I look at this product as a tool, it strikes me as being very well designed for it's purpose. As an idea, I don't see anything wrong with it. And it does what it claims to do. But ... when I attempt to use it, it creates sensations so completely unbearable that I dread using it each time. The device does what it's intended to do as advertised, but the tickling sensation it creates in my nose is more than I can stand for even 2 or 3 seconds. I reverted back to tiny cuticle scissors. I can't say it's necessarily the fault of the product, but for me, it just didn't work."
1,Not good on first round,"Got it in the mail, but it doesn't work so need to send back. Had one before and it worked well, so. . ."
2,"Started OK, didn't last","I thought this was going to be a step up from the cheap (~$10) first trimmer I bought. It worked reasonably well the first couple of times, then stopped working. If I cleaned and oiled it (using professional-grade clipper lubricant), I could usually get a couple minutes of use before it would slow and stop again. And even when working, it didn't have much power and tended to pull hair rather than trim it. Not worth the effort."
2,Keep looking,"I used the Panasonic ER421KC twice on my nose and ears. It pulls and hurts - not as bad as tweezers - but not fun. The little LED light is a joke.I dropped it on a tile floor from 3 feet this morning and apparently dented the metal tip. The dent is almost imperceptible, but it was enough to keep the internal blade from spinning. Panasonic wants $10.11 plus shipping to replace the tip. I can buy the Wahl trimmer for 10 bucks, so I guess I'll do that instead."
1,Poor design,"I purchased this trimmer in 2006, and ended up using a cheapo trimmer that I picked up at Marshall's much more. The Panasonic trimmer, sadly, never worked as intended. The cutting blade part would get stuck in the cap assembly, and only much careful adjusting could cause it to spin. When it did spin, it did not do so properly - the blades would get stuck on the head assy and it would stop spinning. This made for a very annoying and at times painful experience. I'm not giving up on Panasonic and after my el cheapo groomer died, I am getting a Vortex trimmer which seems to be rated higher than this one."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this trimmer over a year ago and was satisfied with it intially, however after a year - it just died. Changed the battery and nothing - I suppose for the price - and it lasting one year - I got what I paid for."
1,Dead,Worked fine for a few months but will no longer power on. Will work for a few minutes if I shake it but dies soon after. Not worth the $15.
2,Short lived.,"This trimmer worked great at first, but only lasted a few short months (with minimum use) before it simply stopped working!"
1,do not buy this cheap peice of crap,"Broke after only a few uses. It actually deserves zero stars,but zero stars is not an option on this rating website."
3,Its good enough. But not flawless,"Trims hair as expected.It runs on a single AA battery. I found that it did not run with a wellknown battery brand.I checked with another battery brand and it worked. I guess if the battery lead's shape slightly even varies, the trimmer doesn't make contact and stays dead."
2,Don't bother,Don't pay the extra for the light. It is barely visible (less than 1/8th candle power?) and is aimed parallel to the cutter so you can't see what your doing as you trim nose hairs. I got it because I had the previous model which worked much better than this one until the battery died after many years.
1,forget about buying this hair trimmer,This is a really bad hair trimmer. It has trouble trimming the hair on my ears. Either the motor doesn't have enough power or the blade is not properly designed. I should have followed the advice given by other reviewers of this product.Missed my chance to return the product as I took too long to open and try out the item.
3,Nothing Special,I've owned it for a couple years now and it does the job. When the battery begins to weaken there is a sudden drop in performance. When it finally croaks I'll get a newer model for a few dollars more.
1,Very disappointed,"This product worked well for only a few weeks. After that, the power was very weak, so we changed the batteries. Again, it only worked a few weeks before the power weakened significantly. We tried adjusting the battery strip to more tightly grasp the battery, but it still failed. After replacing the batteries twice in less than 3 months, the product stopped working completely. Do not purchase this product. Search elsewhere!"
5,Awesome Product,"It does what it says. It's easy to clean. I love the fact that it uses disposable batteries, and the battery will last quite a while before it runs down.The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is the LED light. I guess if the power goes out, it's a handy backup flashlight? I can't figure out any possible geometry between this device, my hand, my nose, and my eye that will allow me to use the light for its intended purpose."
1,Don't buy,"This is the second I have bought this item within the last year. I recognize that they are not expensive. The first one last several months; the second lasted three weeks. Panasonic will do nothing unless I pay $50 for them to ""check it out."" That is absurd for an $17 item.I am not sure what is better, but this is a piece of junk."
3,Not the best,"I ordered this on a whim. Yes, I have un-wanted nose and ear hair. I received it on time and in one piece... or so I thought. After installing the battery, nothing. It seems that my unit was defective. I decided to try and fix it myself. One loose wire in the housing was all that was wrong. It works OK now but its not that great a design. It left my wanting."
5,Excellent Nose Trimmer,"I've always used a nose trimmer, and wanted one with a stainless steel blade. This one is excellent. The blades are sharp, and you can hear it. The light is useless as far as I am concerned unless God had given me eyes on my chin. All it will do is drain the battery faster. If I can find the wire I will cut it. It should have come with an on/off switch. That's nothing to take away from this excellent trimmer. It is still the best I have ever purchased."
2,Can be Painful,"This works OK after several passes, but seems to pluck hair out in a rather painful manner. I don't enjoy using this thing."
5,quiet and does not hurt,I bought this item for my boyfriend which is much better than the Panasonic ER405AC Wet/Dry Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer I bought for myself. This trimmer is much quieter and does not pull on nose hairs while trimming so it does not hurt. And it helps to have the option of the light if necessary.
4,Does the job,Excellent trimmer. Does the job. The light is useless though. But that's ok. You can feel the device snipping your nose hair. I don't use for ear trimming so I don't know how well it works for that.
4,Performs well.,"My nosehair is not made of steel, and I've found this trimmer to be both ergonomic and an excellent performer. The light is an absolute gimmick: I can see nothing, at least not up my nose, with it. I had an older Panasonic that also performed well, but the blades dulled and I got tired of watery eyes from the yanking on the hairs. Nice that it can be used in wet and dry conditions too! I like the feel in my hand, kind of like a mini version of the Oral-B Triumph toothbrish series, which I also own and recommend."
2,It's works but there's better out there,"I had an older model Panasonic that always worked perfect until I needed to replace it. So, I replaced it with another Panasonic. It works but it needs more time to get things done. Always sounding like it is running on a soon to be dead battery. This is even when a brand new battery has been installed."
2,takes really long time,The blade is really slow and it takes a long time and repeated efforts to get a clean job done. Its like shaving with a bad razor. It makes quite a bit of noise but not much of trimming.
3,Heaven up my nose,Upon turning on the nose and ear trimmer one is transported to a heavenly plane. A plane void of unwanted nose and ear growth that is effortlessly removed with this trimmer. I'm no longer pointed at by young children or teased by woman. My proboscis remains as well groomed as any 18th green.
2,NOT WORTH $1,"Cheap plastic, rinky-dink motor...died after 6 months and MAYBE 5 uses. There's a reason why you can find a million of these on auction websites. Don't waste your money. Go for something that is well made...and seriously...what is the deal with the light on this? Where do they think we are using this?"
1,Can-a-sonic,"Wish I had purchased the other trimmer at another site, for $20 more that cut when you pushed the on button. This Panasonic needs to be 'canned'. This one must be a fan for knats, it doesn't trim. The light feature could be nice, if an engineer would have designed it instead of Helen Keller. I was, and am, disappointed and would find a better product in using my 4 year older trimmer with no light, or wet/dry feature. Don't purchase."
1,Doesn't cut very close - not recommended,"I've owned the predecessor to this model, the 411, for several years and had great luck with it. It's getting old, so I upgraded to the 421, which is much quieter and cuts with ease. Unfortunately, the 421 is useless because it leaves a considerable length of hair behind. In fact, it leaves as much hair as I used to start with when trimming with the 411. The blade on the 421 is recessed from the tip way too far. I'm an engineer and studied the inside of the unit to make sure there wasn't a manufacturing defect, and everything looked very solid and well assembled. I cleaned up my old 411 and it's working far better than my new 421, which is headed for the trash or a return to Amazon. Definitely not recommended."
2,Does not do the job,"I was looking forward to an update to an old nose hair trimmer when I ordered this. I was greatly disappointed by the cutting ability - or lack thereof - of this product. I thought I must have put some bum batteries in, but even after replacing the batteries the speed was not good enough to avoid tugging on hairs. Not a good buy."
2,Not Great,This does not do a great job trimming your hairs. It also can be painful sometimes. I am back to using a small pair of scissors.
2,Disappointing,"The shape of the trimmer makes trimming ear hair very difficult. As for the nose, did a good job trimming the hair but it irritated the inside of my nose after only a few uses."
4,Does the job well,"HAd this about 4 weeks and no problems so far. I haven't dropped it/run over it with a car/fished it out of the toilet, so I can't vouch for its durability. The light is completely useless, unless you need an emergency trim during a blackout. The cheaper Panasonic is probably just as good.Final word to potential purchasers - nose hair stubble is a completely new experience."
1,What can I say other than ... OUCH,"Looks well made. Looks well designed. But when you use it, it will pull often, and when it does, it hurts. I tried two of these (this and a cheaper Panasonic), both were the same. I've gone back to Wahl, which don't pull ever in my experience. Your mileage may vary."
1,Weak and painful,"This trimmer worked great the first few times. Then it got weaker and weaker. Even with a new battery, it constantly stops and causes pain sometimes pulling the hair instead of cutting. Don't buy this. Really. (also the light is useless)"
2,Try the Norelco one..,1) Doesn't get that deep2) pulls hairs A LOT and it hurts3) stopped working after a few months4) sucks up batteries like it's nobody's business
1,Weak and short-lived,"Have had it for a year or less, used it very infrequently and it no longer turns on. Even when it worked it had a very weak motor and would take quite some time before it turned on."
3,Lost the blade because of the difficult packaging,"I have yet to try out the trimmer, and will comment on this in the future after it has been used, however, I already have a HUGE complaint with the packaging of this item. It is incredibly difficult to open - so difficult that when I finally got it opened (it took almost all of my strength) the trimmer dropped and pieces went everywhere. I found everything but the blade, which I hope I'll find tomorrow."
2,"Started out ok, but went down hill too fast","The metal at the tip is kinda soft and it appears to have bent a little. I can't see it, but I hear the razors scraping the inside, and sometimes it gets so bad it completely binds up and halts the rotation of the blades all together. I've done everything I can to try to fix it, but it just appears to be a bit cheaply made. It's certainly not a bad price, but I'm going to spend a few more bucks on the replacement I buy to try to get something a little more reliable, and better designed."
2,Great. but broke too soon.,I loved this thing while I had it. But the motor died in around a year and a half. They probably made it in China.
2,barely adequate nose and ear trimmer,"Having had a panasonic trimmer in the past, I expected this to be equally as effective.....not so. I would not recommend it."
1,Stalls,Worked for a few years but now stalls. I don't use it much so it should still be in good shape. Changing the battery did not help.
4,Good value nose hair trimmer,"Works as promoted. The light however does not really help much as it does not illuminate the area you are working on. Maybe it was the one I got, but it seems that the aim is off. Otherwise, excellent."
2,Disappointing,"This product does not provide a close trim, and it does not grab or trim hair well. After less than a year of use, we gave up on it."
2,Shop around.,I got this to replace a $4 trimmer I picked up at a walmart/target/cvs... 5+ years ago. That el cheapo was much better at actually grooming than this unit.
2,"Gets the job done, when it works",It basically does what its supposed to do. My only complaint is that it has a tendency of pulling the hair too much. I assume this is because the blades don't spin quite fast enough.*** update. 1 month later and the thing stopped working. The blade is catching on the interior metal. This is probably because the components are cheap Chinese plastic.
1,Broken after using it for only several times.,"This hair trimmer broken after only a few months after I bought it, during which period it has been used for only a couple of times."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This product only worked for a couple of months. Tried changing batteries several times, but it does absolutely nothing! Do not waste your money. For $16.00 (I know, not astronomically priced), it should work for several years. The item wasn't even used that much. What happened to quality manufacturing?!?"
1,OW!,"Ouch! Hope you can focus through the tears. This thing pulls and pulls and pulls your nose hairs. The battery compartment is almost impossible to open, and now the thing has died, 6 months of occasional use later. Awful experience. Hated this product."
5,"Works great, purchased direct from Amazon","I've had one of these for years and it works great. Recently I started spending a lot of time in another city and instead of hauling this around I bought a second one for the new place. It works just as well as the old one -- batteries last for months, it cuts well with my moderately stiff hair, and there is no pulling or pain.As for the negative reviews, I've seen nothing that would suggest why those problems have occurred. The two things I wonder are hair type (maybe it works better for somewhat straighter and/or firmer hair, e.g., typical brown hair?) or that products coming from some off-brand sellers are not as reliable (I usually purchase directly from Amazon instead of other sellers, unless the price differential is huge)?For the price, I'd recommend to give it a try. Good luck!"
4,Excellent!,Does the trick very well with little to absolutely no pulling. This is the original and better than the one with the curved head :)
2,"They told me so, but I didn't listen","I shop frequently at Amazon and am a very satisfied customer. I usually read and follow the reviews but this time I ignored the poor reviews because I had owned another Panasonic model Nose and ear trimmer and it worked just fine. The ER421KC is unfortunately lousy and the most absurd part is the light which does nothing. I can not believe how bad this item really is. The unit does not trim properly, operates too slow for comfort and swift trimming, does not do a good job of it and all the while, the silly dot of light reflects on your face far from the area that you are trying to trim. If I had not wasted my money buying this, I would think of this as a funny joke on me. Buyer beware, unless, of course, you have the sense of humor that I sorely lack."
1,Disappointed!,"This is a mono recording. If you are picky regarding the quality of recordings, do not buy this as your ears will object. It was recorded in 1957 when stereo was available. I love her voice, but I hate the quality of this recording."
2,Maybe Pete Droge just isn't for me...,"I've always wanted to get into Pete Droge's music. I think his song ""Beautiful Girl"" is a great song. I also enjoy The Thorns cd. I also like his song ""If You Don't Love Me I'll Kill Myself"" from Dumb and Dumber. Also, he has a quick cameo in Almost Famous as Gram Parsons while singing the chorus to ""Small Time Blues"" that I enjoyed. ""Small Time Blues"" was enough to make me want to check this cd out and when I read the good fan reviews on Amazon, I went for it.... Wish I hadn't. In my opinion, the music was generic and the lyrics were uninspired. Fans of Pete Droge may really enjoy this disc, but it is not for the casual listener."
2,Don't fight with this tape pen,This tape pen needs another round of testing by the manufacturer. I was fighting with this thing through my whole project. What happens is the used tape doesn't retract into the pen so you're constantly winding it. What a pain.
1,Do not buy from Home Naturals,While the product is great Home Naturals is a theif! I ordered this 2 boxes of the product from Home Naturals and they decided to ship only 1...... I am extremely irritated! :-(
3,Assorted tea sampler,"This was part of a gift I gave to a tea lover. She said she 'enjoyed"" the tea. Difficult to judge whether the tea lived up to my expectations. Personally, judging from the price I paid, I would have expected a more exuberant comment from her."
2,box was destroyed,"I bought this mixed box of tea flavors as a gift for my niece, who is new to the world of tea. The box was ripped and taped shut in a shoddy manner. It is totally un-presentable as a gift. I like Tazo tea myself, so I'll end up drinking it -- but at $12 for the box, I am disappointed, and now I still have to buy something else for my niece! Another reviewer said there were less than 24 teas - I counted, there are definitely 24."
2,Missing Tea and Crumpled box,"Tazo makes excellent tea and this assorted sampler is an excellent way to try a good few of them at once. However, The box came crumpled and both of the Tazo Lotus tea bags were empty."
5,Gift for my sister-in-law,My sister-in-law loves tea and I figured the assorted Tazo sampler would be good to get her accustomed to other flavors.
2,Tooo much of black tea,I though these would be sachets but they were reg tea bags and they didn't taste all that great. There is more of black tea than flavored
2,Not the spirograph of yesteryear!,"What a disappointment this version of spirograph is. It is not the wonderful, colorful creative toy of yesteryear which used pins to hold the forms and paper in place and had almost too many wheels!It has just a few wheels that snap into one single geared form for storage (a very nice feature.) That form has nice edges that kind of hold the gears in place as young hands move the wheels around the edge of the forms to make the fun shapes. The kit includes one pen (I remember a pen with 4 colors in the old toy and pins that stuck the paper to cardboard to hold the forms in place. This toy requires the young artist to hold the form with their hands which is a very difficult task to do.)My 6 year old could barely manage the play, and was bored very quickly. My 4 year old couldn't handle it all, so you might want to consider the toy for an older child and buy an extra set of colored pens and a pack of extra paper."
2,Bring Back the old Spirograph!!!!!!!,I recently asked for a spirograph for Christmas thinking I was going to get the one with over 45 wheels. When I opened the gift all there were was 5 wheels and all these stencils that were unnecessary. I would not recommend getting this. Find an original spirograph. Please bring back the old spirograph!!!!!!!!!!
3,Where are all the other shapes?,This is a great toy. I loved it when I was a child. This new Spirograph ony has the round gears. Were did the football and X and the 3 inch long gears go? What is the deal does it cost to much to add three more colored pens? Well after a little thought I can see what they mean about the good old days.
1,Surely more than 200 posters can only be the tip of the iceberg!,"I did not buy one of the new spirographs based on the reviews I read. But... if I were a smart marketing exec at Hasbro or one of the big toy companies I would do some math, for every 1 person that has taken the time to write a note begging someone to bring back the original Spirograph 401 (or dare I suggest the Super Spirograph?) there would be probably 100 in line to buy one. I for one would buy one for my two grown kids, all my grandkids, nieces, and nephews and one for myself - just in case some ""forward-thinking"" executive(notice the sarcasm there) decided to EVER stop making them. The original Spirograph 401 and the Super Spirograph in 1969 were the best toys any kid ever hoped for. PLEASE someone bring this back in the same config, quality as days gone by!"
1,Junk,"Save your money, go on Ebay and buy a REAL Spirograph. Absolutely worth it. This is no way compares to the original and is a waste of money."
3,Gimme the good ole days,"This item is no where near as nice as the old Spirograph. Far fewer pieces, lightweight and a cheap box that doesn't come close to holding all the pieces in. You get huge boxes for computer software, but you get a flimsy one piece of cardboard box that is supposed to hold this set together. Pieces were lost within a week. I am disappointed."
1,The old one is better,"This new version is bad! The old version (I have the one from 1988) came with all different shapes to use such as a footbal and an x and came with 3 pens and had the clips to hold the shapes down on the paper. Don't buy this new version, try to find one from the 1980's, it is worth it."
2,Poor Quality...just not like they used to be,"Not user friendly at all. We bought the bigger version in the store with the carrying case. Just a poorly made product, cheap plastic, many pieces were warped. Everything had a place in the case but not everything fit, the spaces for the pens to snap in were too small. Obviously, we'll be taking it back."
4,Sometimes change is not better.,"I have to say that SpiroTot and Spirograph were two of my favorite toys as a child. One Christmas, when I was four, I ignored all the dolls and expensive toys under the tree to play with my new SpiroTot set. I don't think the newer versions are nearly as fun as the old ones. I guess they were considered not safe enough for today's standards. If that is the case, please, Hasbro, bring back the old versions (with the pattern books and the pins) for the adults! I think I'm in the mood for some Spirograph right now! With that in mind, the newer Spirograph is still a fun toy for children that seems to be as enjoyable as that never boring favorite - Playdo."
3,Just Not the Same,"I grew up in the 80's playing with Spirograph. I had the old set with the various sized wheels and different gears. But I moved from New York to Arizona at 9. I had the Spirograph in the backseat with me and would play with it during the four day drive, but unfortunately, I left it in the back window and it warped from the sun.The other day I was in a store and saw a set on clearance for about $... I thought that it would be fun to play with it again. But it doesn't hold the same excitement as it once did. Not because I'm 23 now, but because they just couldn't leave well enough alone. As with everything else in the world they had to change it. Smaller gears, less gears, less fun. Try and find the old version if you want a Spirograph for fun."
2,A pale shadow of the original,"I bought this toy out of nostalgia for the hours of fun I used to have with my Spirograph when I was a kid. Oh, how I wish I still had that old toy! This new Spirograph is missing the variety of shapes and options of the old toy, really lmiting the results. I agree with the reviewer below who asked, please, at least bring back the many shapes secured by pins into cardboard for us adults! And yes, the new toy comes with only one pen, with boring blue ink like you can buy anywhere. Bring back the 4 or 5 pens, too!"
1,YUCK! Who took the REAL Spirograph?,Glad to see I was not the only one who thought this was an awful imitation of the Spirograph I loved as a kid. My 5 year old played with this once 9 months ago and hasn't touched it since. Why couldn't they even include the 4 colored pens? (Only 1 comes in the box now.) Definitely better off spending your money elsewhere. How about an Etch-A-Sketch?
1,Not Worth A Dime,"This item is Spirograph in name only. It bears little to no resemblance of the toy you knew and loved as a child. It is cheaply made, has many less exciting gears, and no longer has a large frame to make full-sized designs.Save your money. Buy anything else.Just not this."
1,Just Not The Same!!,Was very disappointed with this version of Spirograph. Bring back the original!! Please!! I used to love my spirograph many years ago. What happened to all the gears and instructions to make wonderful creations. I got many hours of enjoyment with my old spirographh. What I would give to have it back. This excuse for spirograph is BORING!!!
3,"Adults disappointed, children satisfied","My husband and I were disappointed with the limited spirograph choices, we remember the one from our childhood. The best thing was having the book with instructions on how to make the creations they showed. We were careful not to show that disappointment to our 7 year old son, because he is enjoying it, however, I feel it will be short lived because his options are very limited. I hope Hasbro reads these reviews and gets nostalgic by bringing back the old system. I would pay ... more to have the choices we had as kids."
5,Good Reference Material,I enjoyed this book and it is very helpful as reference material. It is a good companion to other electrical engineering material.
5,Myth of the Cross,"This book is short,concise and convincing. Its nice to see it reissued now. Those who are looking for arguments to research pagan intrusions into Christianity will be pleased.The problem of course is bigger than the use of pagan symbols. To what extent has Christendom become pagan in itself in its beliefs and ritualistic practices?A more thorough presentation is found in Alexander Hislop's The Two Babylons."
3,disappointing,"This was my daughter's favorite Christmas gift, but a big disappointment as Cinderella's head popped off within the first few days and many times subsequently. I called the company and they sent a voucher to replace it but for less than I paid for the set. Also, like all dolls of this size, the shoes are maddeningly small and so easy to lose."
3,Ugh! SO hard to dress!,"I have to say that in spite of my low opinion, my 3-year-old LOVES this toy. But if you don't want to hear ""Mommy, can you help me put on Cinderella's dress"" every two minutes, buy another toy. These rubber gowns are SO hard to put on, even for my husband and me. And the gloves are a joke - they don't get past her wrists (which upsets my daughter - she thinks we're not trying hard enough), and the teeny tiny itsy bitsy eensy weensy shoes only stay on occasionally, because of the tackiness of the plastic, not because they're actually designed to fit the doll's foot. Like I said, my daughter loves this toy, but she can't play with it independently. This is my first introduction to ""polly pocket"" style toys, and I have to say, I'm not looking forward to the next few years of this!"
5,An uplifting and empowering book to face cancer.,"Uplifting with a powerful message for individuals facing a cancer diagnosis and their caregivers. Beyond Miracles captures with warmth Dr. Hersh's knowledge of traditional and nontraditional medicine, and his understanding of the psychological needs of cancer patients and their caregivers. Empowers the individual to take charge in the healing process."
4,My husband and I work out together NOW,"I am very pleased with this home gym. My husband and I are both business owners with very limited extra time. We bought this product, we dedicated an entire day to assemble it. (The item numbers were hard to follow but once we figured it out it was smooth sailing. We assembled it in about 7 hours (they suggest that you have a professional do the assembling but it wasn't bad). I love it because our schedule is getting up in the morning going into our gym - working out and then having breakfast. Since we don't have to drive to a gym - we have the time. Great product - we are very satisfied."
2,"Decent music, but awful emo vocals","Got this album as a highly recommended piece from bnrmetal.com. Unfortunately, it doesn't really live up to the expectations I placed on it.First things first- the music is good. Good melodies, crunchy guitars and great drums by Pat McGrath who is no longer with Prototype. Not a ridiculous amount of flash, but enough to make it interesting. Not too much to annoy.So everything works except for the singer. Vince Levalois is absolutely awful. His voice is that annoying numetal/emo punk whine. Exactly that sound. It's awful and mismatched to the music. He even goes as far as making those pitch (whine) changes just like those Green Day type bands. It simply doesn't work and completely negates the great musicianship.A one for the singing and five for the music would've averaged to a 3, but the singing is that bad. I bought the album for $16 from the local record store. I would not recommend it for that price.Definite potential, but they have to get a new singer."
3,A pretty cool Simpsons book!.,"This Simpsons Halloween special is a pretty cool bookand an interesting read at that. It is well writtenand scary, esp. for little kids and a good read forfans of the show like me :)"
1,Sorry but misrepresented disappointing,DISNEY PRECIOUS PRINCESS COLLECTIBLE SLEEPING BEAUTYItem was misrepresented. Title said Sleeping Beauty and picture was for Ariel. Additional picture shows several figurines and product discription is as followsProduct FeaturesDisney Favorite Moments¿ 4-Pack Giftset Collect all four of your favorite small Disney Princess dolls in one complete giftset!....We received 1 small figurine comparable to what you would find in a Happy meal.If we recieved a 4 pack for the $17.99 it still would have been a stretch. Will return item. Ships and sold by Amazon. I expect more from Amazon. Don't waste the effort or money
2,Beware..,It's the wig not hair! I've got the Sleeping Beauty one and her hair keeps falling down! My girls didn't like the bold princess at all and almost never played with it :( Check the hair before buy it.I gave two stars for durability cause the clothes are made of hard plastic.
1,Junk! Lasted less than 2 years.,"We purchased this disposal almost 2 years ago. I was replacing a lessor HP Badger that only lasted 4 years. I should have seen this coming. The disposal leaked out of the bottom of the unit, same as the previous one. The seal on the inside wears out quickly. The inside was nothing but rust and corrosion. I am replacing this one with a Waste King (lifetime warranty) due to the reviews compared to this brand. This only comes with a one-year warranty which it will probably fail shortly after."
2,Corrosion,"We have had this unit for about 6 years, and for the last couple we have been wondering where water was coming from under the sink. All pipes were tight and nothing leaked continuously. Eventually figured out that when a fair amount of garbage made water to hold in the grinder chamber switching the disposal unit on caused water to leak out from the upper cone area. When used with only a small amount of garbage there were no leaks and no problems, but now the corrosion has got so severe that when the last backup occurred water sprayed like a jet across the kitchen when the cabinet door was open. We are in Florida, near Cape Canaveral and salt corrosion is a problem outdoors but we are on city water and should not have a problem in the house plumbing."
5,informative and insightful,"this book is packed with different info on greek goddesses, it relates women to 7 different goddesses, the virgin goddesses: artemis, athena, and hestia. the vulnerable goddesses:hera,demeter, and peresphone. and the alchemical goddess: aphrodite. it talks about different types of women different roles we play in our lives. it gives great history on the goddesses, how we are like them. excellent book it will teach you something about yourself."
1,"Yuck, yuck, yuck","As a children's librarian, I shiver with disgust that these books actually got published. The writing is so juvenile and choppy that it's truly painful to read. The stories go nowhere, and the characters are undeveloped and silly (but not in a good way). I would not recommend these books to anyone. If you're looking for fun, try Roald Dahl, Junie B. Jones, or heck, even the CatDog series. Anything but Space Dog!"
3,Yet another Scorpions remix,"There are some really good songs on this album, that'swhy I gave it 3 stars - if this is one of your very firstScorpions albums, it may be worth buying.For the rest of us, this is simply just another remix oftheir soft-rock-pop commercial songs; virtually all of themhave already been used in more than one of their previousalbums before.Come on, Scorprions, it's about time you produce somethingnew after all these years of shameless remixing!!! Do youremember at all the days when you were still creative,when you produced Taken By Force, Virgin Killer, In Trance,Fly To The Rainbow? You were truly great back then but notanymore."
4,These Japanese CDs always have something else :),"This show is very good for any Scorpions fan. This time acoustic,featuring a bonus track, Rhythm of love, very good.Scorpions have also an other recent live album, playing with Berlim Philarmoniker Orchestra, which along with this one is a very good combination.There are also very good versions of news songs like Hurricane 2001 (ok, I know this is a new version of Rock you like a hurricane) and oldies, like Holiday. Another spot from acoustica is ""Love of my Life"", originally from Queen, loud and clear this time by Klaus Meine (Scorpions vocalist), very good and vibrating.Indeed, nice show and CD."
3,BEST OF OUTCASTE,"This is probably the best album Outcaste have released. It contains some great drum'n'bass tracks and mixes in Indian samples with ease. However the drum'n'bass tracks on this album are nothing compared to peep's like Roni Size or Dillinja.The best songs on this album come from Niraj Chag. His songs are more ambient, and 'Walk Alone' has to be one of the greatest ambient tracks i've heard. It combines celtic sounds, similar to enya, with soft sitar's and tubla's. This album is a great album for people who are into or are getting into the asain new music scene. Check out Nitin Sawhney, Badmarsh+Shri and Talvin Singh."
1,RHF,Do you like secondary pulmonary hypertension followed by right heart failure (cor pulmonale)? Red bush tea causes this... go get some green tea instead.
1,Be warned,"Don't buy this book unless your instructor specifically requires it. Terribly written with virtually no sign of editing, it's a struggle to read and, when covering extremely technical issues, virtually incomprehensible. Worse, the content does not exactly match the on-line curriculum, meaning that Cisco on-line tests typically ask questions about topics not covered in the relevant book chapter. Even worse, the answers to the tests in the book don't match the questions being asked. Buy the Sybex CCNA book instead; although it's not written to match the on-line course, it will help clarify networking, and not leave the reader frustrated and feeling cheated.In short, this book is something of a disaster, and by no means should be used by someone who's simply looking for a textbook on computer networks. Much, much better would be ""Computer Networking"" by Kurose.I hate writing negative reviews, but this book certainly calls for it."
2,Poorly written,"I am using this book in a CCNA semester 1 class. Although it is by Cisco and therefore contains the information they want you to know, it is poorly written. It is as if the original text were 3 times as long, and to shorten it, they had to take out every third sentence, because it does not flow, and concepts are often only half-explained. I am *often* reading it and think ""What????"" (And I'm fairly certain it's not just me - I have a B.S. and M.S in Computer Science and plenty of real-world computer experience). All in all, I have to say that this is not a high-quality book.Although it's not a substitute for the CCNA material, I really like the book called ""Interconnections"" by Radia Perlman."
2,CCNA 1 and 2,"This book has so many errors in it. I,ve spent hours reviewing material that ended up being incorrect. I took the CCNA class online through the Cisco academy and there is quite a bit of questions that are only in the book and not in the curriculum. Cisco has a long way to go. Hope this helps someone."
1,Poor for beginners,"Like the previous reviewer stated, this book isn't for everyone. The text is very hard to read due to a lot of jargon that is unnecessary. Most terms aren't even explained until after they are used chapters before being defined. This book also does not correspond well with the online tests very well.You would think that with a little determination and this book, you'd be able to ace all the online tests. This is not true, however, as this book fails to explain a majority of the test questions. (I actually rely on my instructors notes over the reading the book when necessary)Don't get it unless you have to."
3,Sex-Crime Panic,"I found this to be an interesting story since the Mt. Pleasant facility is where I currently work and have been there for over 30 years. That is why I would like to correct the error on page 144, ""opened in 1865, the second state facility of its kind west of the Mississippi"", when introducing the facility. The first patient arrived in February, 1861 and this was the first facility of its kind west of the Mississippi. Just wanted to set the record straight. Miller does a good job for the reader in explaining the short-lived sexual psychopath law in Iowa. I even knew 3 people mentioned in the book."
1,Sadly wanting,"I hoped to find a good book for my young daughter that would treat the Holocaust in a compassionate and inclusive manner. This isn't the book. I read it first and ended up giving it away for a yard sale. I later found another book, called Hope's War, which was really good and which is now making the rounds of my daughter's grade school and early high school friends. She really liked the book and so did I."
4,"Black Voice, White Body","I have been an admirer of Renee Geyer's singing for more than 20 years now, and I rate this as perhaps her all-time best album. Forget your Dusty Springfields et al: THIS lady is the closest thing on the planet to a black voice in a white body. And what a soulful, evocative voice it is! For me, it's dusky tones are a cross between Marianne Faithfull and Aretha Franklin. Backed by the brilliant talents of Paul Kelly and Joe (Jo Jo Zep) Camilleri, this album displays beautifully the tonal and emotional vocal range of Ms Geyer. Although it has always been great, her voice seems to get better and better with age. Sweet Life is an album you will listen to over and over, without ever getting tired of it. I would have given it 5 stars, but I like to keep some headroom in my ratings - just in case there's a better album waiting in a studio somewhere around the corner."
5,Dont Walk Away Renee,"What a voice!! I'f you like a strong and powerful voice full of character and emotion (e.g. Alison Moyet) then Renee is for you. Move over Cass. Wilson; Renee is your lady! Her voice is stong, powerful, and emotive!! Love Always-Tassie, Australia!!"
2,A bit too slick,"Undeniably, Renee Geyer has a voice that has proven to be one of the strongest and most sophisticated of all female vocalists, with the ability to sorround herself with brilliant musicians who can lay down soulful and sometimes jazzy grooves. Sweet life continues to demonstrate her incredible voice, but completely fails to include any complimentary music. If you are a fan of real instruments, this album is not for you. There is an overabundance of synthetic strings and bland arrangements that are a far cry from some of the soulful performances of her earlier work. Be ready to be amazed by the muse, but put to sleep by the band..."
5,Subtle and beautiful,"BREATH OF THE DRAGON is a beautiful book, subtle, its language spare and poetic. It is the story of Malila, a young Thai girl who comes to live with her grandmother after a family crisis. Malila's grandmother is a wonderful person, creating an atmosphere where the little girl's artistic talents can flourish and where she can feel safe and loved. Within this story Giles seamlessly interweaves fascinating information about the customs and culture of Thailand. I highly recommend this book and eagerly await more works by Gail Giles!"
2,Don't swallow the hype here,"FFYL is a cheap exploitation film that, as so many others, promises a whole lot and delivers extremely little, unless you're into bad acting and huge plot holes. Is it insulting and politically incorrect? Yeah, but something like Mandingo was far, far more insulting. As far as the ""nightmare"" of degradation and sexual abuse, did these folks see another film?Again, there are far far more degrading films out there. All told, if it weren't for about 20 uses of certain words and 30 seconds, if that, of nudity, this would be rated a solid PG, and could almost be shown on TV. After having heard about this for years, it was a huge disappointment."
1,It sucked!!!,Acting sucked. Screenplay sucked. Casting sucked. And the movie was too long. Save your cash.
1,This is not the CDs that go with the workbook!,"My Spanish 1A instructor gave me an ISBN number, and Amazon took me to this page, so I bought it thinking it was the audio CDs that goes with the workbook. It doesn't. It is an ""Interactive CD-ROM"".The product's ISBN number I'm talking about is 0072525371 (Amazon has this review on 2 different pages)."
3,Average Horse Book,"Overall I would just consider this book to be average. It's a story about a group of children in Britain (I believe) that all have their horses at the slightly run-down yet cozy Sandy Lane Stables. The story really focuses on one rider in particular (Tom) and his borrowed horse ""Chancy."" The horse has almost been ruined by a bad rider and is now quite dangerous and unpredictable but Tom makes up his mind to try and re-train the horse. Over the course of the book Tom secretly works with the horse, risks being barred from the stable, and then saves the horse from a watery death in the ocean.A light and happy ending and a fast read. Not particularly Joanna Campbell quality but not too bad either; just a bit predictable."
5,A Great Book!!!,This is a great book for any age group and it kept me turning pages all day long. Sandy Lane seems like such a great stable and if I could I would ride there. Michelle Bates gives great descriptions and I hope that there are a lot more good Sandy Lane books to come!
3,Not too bad,It certainly shoots the darts a long way and without a great deal of effort. The only down side is that the sucker part of the dart does not stick to anything...even glass. But the kids love it.
5,They broke the mold for Neapolitan singers after Di Stefano.,"I heartily agree with the other review (March 20). This Neapolitan album is the ""how to"" of Neapolitan singing.Di Stefano was the master of Neapolitan singing (just ask Pavarotti).Listen to ""Core N Grato"" (his signature Neapoltian song) for one of the most wonderful moments in singing.All these songs require the full range of tenor singing ability, range, phrasing,emotion etc. Di Stefano caresses lyrics when needed, and belts it out when needed, without ""hamming it up"" as so many others do.Buying this album, or it its stereo follow-up, would be a most worthwile purchase for any fan of Neapolitan singing."
2,corny,"Why, o, why would a singer with the technical mastery of Di Stefano agree to sing to saccharine, corny, hackneyed, maudlin, mawkish arrangements such as these? Beats me"
4,Quality trance,"This guy knows what he is doing, if you like the good trance. there are some old glories like L`esperanza, wernons wonderland, the harlequin, ect.Besides they are not mixed, I think every trance lover should have this one, it is worth."
5,An Olivia Classic!!!,"I have owned this album on 8-Track tape, Cassette tape, LP record & now on CD. If another release occurs in a newer version (remastered or different format) I will buy it! Why? Because every song is great! To this day I still feel this is Olivia Newton-John's best album. If an Olivia Newton-John CD collection is planned, This should be the first purchase! After playing the entire CD, I then go back to play my favorites again. They are: ""Country Girl"", ""The River's Too Wide"", ""Home Ain't Home Anymore"", ""Changes"" & the two hits ""If You Love Me (Let Me Know)"" & ""I Honestly Love You"". I then play the remaining tracks because they're also very good. Olivia's ability to blend country & pop is very well represented on this album. A highly recommended ""Must Have""!!!"
1,poor music quality,"What a disappointment! The music quality is very poor--most of the ""intruments"" sound just like every other cheap kids electronic toy. The piano is probably the worst; the animal voices all sound the same. I thought I'd get better quality at the price, plus, the left speaker doesn't work. My kids had a toy casio keyboard that cost $12.00 and was the size of an egg-carton, and its sound was vastly superior. I will likely have to go through the hassle of returning this."
5,A wonderful book to read.,"An interesting book to read even if you have no interest in winter camping or travel. Mr Rutstrum traveled most of his life in the Canadian wilderness on snowshoes or by dog sled. He tells many interesting stories about his dealings with the Cree, trappers, and hermits, I am assuming the time frame is the 40's through the 60's. I love to read how people used to live before the days of snowmobiles and plowed roads. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a sense of adventure, it is a true classic."
3,More of a novel than a guide,"Though the book is informational and inspiring, I simply did not agree with this being titled a ""guide"", as apposed to calling it a Novel, on the informational side. Put another way, it isn't the expected front to back informational ""guide,"" that I expected. Not to mention out of date in more than one way. The author refers to African Americans as African Negros, and claims that Timber Wolves are of no threat to man as they are afraid of our very scent, which I can assure you that in our day and age, and with the population growth explosion in the Northern U.S. and Canadian tundra, this is just not true, anymore.That said, from a Novel standpoint, this is a great read, if you will just see the inaccuracies for what they are, and take in the wisdom of this amazing person, who seemingly was one of the last of his kind."
3,Technical details,"I read the first three Axbrewder novels with some enjoyment, but the fourth novel presents a major technical problem surprising for a science fiction author: the first three novels are set in the 1980's, which was contemporary when the book was written. Axbrewder and Ginny Fistoulari spend quite a bit of time finding a pay phone or calling Ginny's exchange. The fourth book is set only a few weeks after the third book, and yet there are cell phones and hotel security video cameras and a whole bunch of background technology that just didn't exist in the mid- (or even the late-) 80's.I tend to think of the city the novel is set in as Dallas rather than as Phoenix or Tuscon (because it's so new, shiny, rich and hot), but it doesn't affect the way the story is read. I'm not finished with the book yet, so maybe the story will redeem the technical snafu's, but c'mon..."
1,how many pins?,There are different types of s video cables. I have a 7 pin. most are 4 pins. it does not say how many pins so I cannot buy it.
5,map puzzle,"Was going to hold off giving this puzzle to my 2 year old but decided to go ahead & give it to her anyway. With assistance, she is able to complete the puzzle. She really enjoys it. It has obvious educational value and it is very durable. Thinking of introducing the capitals to her soon. Great puzzle!"
5,A book that goes straight to the heart!,"Well, my church congregation may be mostly white, but this book had me really laughing at its wonderful portrayal of daily life in a church community. The heroine Tameka was sweet, and Assistant Pastor Ty Barnett is to die for. He can come preach at our church any time he likes! <ggg> Especially if he'll agree to go to a church beach party and strip down. <G> And others are right--the beauty parlor scene is a great one!"
5,A MUST read.....TA' DAY!!!,"OMG!!!! What a wonderfully fresh story! This read actually had me on the edge!! Romance, thriller,suspense AND drama!!! AND a word from the Lord! I loved it!!! Tameeka and the Revs story is one you won't want to miss!"
2,Progressive House,"Since there were no reviews of this album when i bought it, i had no idea what to expect. To my disappointment Judgement Euphoria is 3 CD's of progressive house. This is great if you like progressive house but it's my least favorite form of dance music. All the songs sound the same and are painfully boring. As typical of all the euphoria albums I have heard, the mixing seems very well done. Bottem line is, only fans of progressive house should give this album a try."
4,As Good As Pie!!!,"Yes, I liked it. Yes it was good. Disc One and Two were great, but the third disc sucked. That's why I gave it four stars instead of five. In fact, they could do without the 3rd disc being included. Anyway, if you wanna by this CD, go right ahead. If you like ministry of sound, than this is perfect for you!!!"
1,mismailed TomTom One Charger,"I love the Tom Tom One and very highly recommend it. However, the extra electrical charger I ordered does not adapt to the Tom tom One. As I am 3,000 miles away from home the electric charger is a disappointment. But the Tom Tom One is terriffic. It makes adjustments to my wrong turns and keeps me on track. I'm thinking seriously of buying a second one for my wife as soon as I get back home."
2,El libro es bueno.... pero de muy mala calidad,"Cuando vi esta coleccion, pense en irsela comprando a mi hijo. Ahora lo estoy dudando. La primera vez que el lo abrio se quedo con dos paginas despegadas en la mano. Si bien, el libro tiene ilustraciones bonitas, y trata de apegarse a las historia original, la calidad del producto, realmente desanima!"
5,Sooooo fun,This book is a blast! It has a lot of repeat songs but they're different enough that it's fun :)
1,wrong cover,I ordered this edition for the awesomeE Cover. Got a really lame one instead. Pretty sheisty. Don't advertise the edition with that cover.
4,Lost opportunity for ILLUSTRATIONS,"Informative, well researched little book. I so wished for more pictures of the many stripes and striped items described!"
2,Big disappointment,"Sorry to be a naysayer, but I wish I could have seen this bookbefore I purchased it. It has many pages devoted to nothing (littlewords and big cartoon pictures) talking to the kid about whatmight make them upset and spectulating on how upset it mightmake them. The Dear Teachers and Parents at the beginning of thebook contains the only potentially useful information - in myopinion. It describes an exercise for the Relaxed Body - a littledifferent then some other deep exercises - though not necessarilybetter. I felt this book had mostly wasted space. Well, I knowthat the others reviewers felt differently but that's my take."
4,When my Autism gets too big! A relaxation book for children with autism.,"Please amazon bring this book back,so I can purchase it with family driven money. It must be sold by amazon to purchase with money given from county and government. This book is the only thing that helped my son calm down and we don't have $50 to spend on one book. Thank you"
3,Not What I Ordered,"I Ordered this book, but when it arrived it was titled ""When My Anxiety Gets Too Big"". I'm unsure if they have just retitled the book, or the wrong book was shipped in error. I kept the Anxiety book as I DO deal with anxiety episodes in my child and other children I care for, but I have not yet pursued another order for the Austim book."
3,Prefer Defining Emotions,"This is a cute book, clever graphics, well intentioned. I have autistic twins. After reading the book and talking with other parents I suggest giving language for specific emotional states rather than identifying all emotional experiences as, ""my autism"". As another parent said, we don't want to lay the ground work for our kids to explain,""I didn't do my homework because of my autism.""The rating system is a good idea. It can be used for identifying the intensity of an emotion, ""My frustration is at a 4"", ""My anger is at a 3"", etc."
5,So glad that I purchased this book!,"This item is really nicely done. While it isn't printed on the sturdiest paper, the content is first-rate. My 11-y-o son responded immediately and being able to flash 3-or-4 fingers at him is a more positive way of reminding him to calm down. He immediately starts the self-talk script, ""I want to stay at 1 or 2.""I bought another copy right away for his school."
3,Where is the sweetness?,"Although it's called 'Wild Sweet Orange' I have yet to taste the sweetness. For the most part, it seems very tart to me. It's still a decent hot tea (and I bet it'd make a good iced tea too) but this really wasn't what I had expected."
5,My Favorite Herbal Tea - EVER!!!,"I knew when I tore open the package that I was going to like this tea...but little did I know that it was soon to become my all time favorite! The sweet orange aroma reminds me of my childhood...the tangy orange flavor of an orange popsicle, or an orange flavored baby aspirin (St Joseph's) or piece of orange taffy. This makes a wonderful substitute for a sweet dessert...a nice after-dinner treat with no guilt."
5,GREAT WITH CHOCOLATE!,This is the only tea I have found that has a sharp orange flavor. It also has a mint flavor. I love drinking it when eating a chocolate desert. But it's good anytime. I love it.
4,fruity notes -tart citrus taste,"Was served this at a hotel while traveling was very happy to find it available on Amazon. Nice fruity flavor to enjoy on a warm summer afternoon. Served it over ice,the slightly tart flavor tickled my taste buds and refreshed me."
4,Excellent Herbal Blend,"If you like the taste of sour orange then this is the drink for you. It is really good both plain as a tangy hot drink, or sweetened. I haven't tried it iced, but I'd bet it will make a great iced drink.I found this at a conference and couldn't find in local shops, so I was pleased to find it available here."
5,Outstanding!,"I'm not a tea fan, but this orange tea is sooo good! By far the best tea I have ever had."
5,Bigfootrocks,"Charger was well priced, arrived as promised, charges camera battery. What else is there? BFR"
4,Does the job!,Good charger for the price. Plug folds to make it easy to fit in a camera pouch. Cigg and euro adapter included. The led is a bit dim when the charge switches to float but no big deal. Overall a good buy. Very fast delivery..
1,Simply doesn't work!,"I lost my battery charger, and bought this non-Canon brand b/c it was cheap, but you get what you pay for b/c it doesn't work. AT ALL!"
3,Good charger for the money!,"I needed to replace my lost $40 charger (came with the camera, Canon SD-1000Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)) and found this CTA. My lost charger was slim and compact, but this charger outdistanced it with its lower price, auto charger plug and adaptor."
1,Worked for about 10 seconds,"Seeing so many generally positive reviews, I guess I was just unlucky. But, FYI this worked for about 10 seconds for me then quit and never worked again. A piece of junk."
1,DOA,Bought the charger since it came with a car adapter. It does not work when connected to the wall nor does it work in the car.
1,No stars -Doesn't work,"I tried to go ""cheap"" to replace a lost charger. It did not work- at all. It is too little money to fight sending back etc but this goes to show you often get what you pay for."
1,BATTERY CHARGER,i MISPLACED MY ORIGINAL CHARGER SO I BOUGHT THIS ONE. WHEN I RECEIVED IT I DETECTED A BURNT SMELL. I PLUGGED IT IN AND IT DID NOT WORK. I RETURNED IT FOR A FULL REFUND.
4,Great for the price,Battery holder is not all that positive but works fine. Can't complain for the price - does everything that the Canon unit does and more (car adapter) for a quarter of the price...
5,Get the double CD / Avoid the single CDs,"My goodness, but what a difference. I have both versions of this release: the original separate CDs & the re-mastered double CD. The sound of the re-mastered vesion is so far superior that it made me question whether this was the same concert. If you're questioning your need to replace your earlier CDs (or LPs) rest assured, it is worth the expense. I've purchased other NEKTAR re-issues, only to be disappointed. This release is exhilarating!"
5,"The New York show, presented correctly at last","This 1974 concert was originally released in 1977-78 on two separate double vinyl albums, ""Live in New York"" and ""More Live in New York"", and subsequent CDs have also been kept as separate titles. This Eclectic release finally contains the complete concert in its true running order. As well, the original tapes were used and given a remastering. (The 1977-78 Bellaphon releases used non-original tapes and were mixed using a dubious ""artificial head"" technique meant for headphone listening, with muddy compressed results.)If you're new to Nektar, this album makes a great introduction to them - they were superb onstage and played with fire & precision. If you're an old fan who's heard earlier releases of this New York show, this version will be a worthwhile improvement for you - the sound is opened-up and comparatively clear & strong."
3,The Miracle of the Scarlet Thread,This book is good in covering the entire aspect of the saving acts of Jesus Christ. It is good for beginnings as it picks up the very basics of believing Jesus died to be our Savior.
3,The Bible,"This examines the bible and how it can change your life. God revealed himself to all of humanity. There's the Old Testament and the New Testament. The first 5 books of the bible are the Torah. The 4 gospels are Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The seven headed monster of Revelation was the seven hills at Rome; they were going to kill all the Christians."
2,[Charlie McCarthy],"Its has a string in the back which causes the whole thing to fly backword, you have no control of his arms or his head. You might as well use a sock puppet! This was a ture disapointment!"
3,Spooky but fun,"I gotta say when my brother got this toy I got freaked out. It was all like a fake human> He used to scare me with it and laugh when I freaked out. After reading Gossebumps and ""Slappy"" the talking dummy went and got everyone to be his slave, I just hated the idea that they were real toys, let alone HAVING ONE IN MY OWN HOUSE!!!!But after a while, I just couldn't help but play with him. He was so funny when he moved his mouth. I began to tell him all my problems at school, with friends, etc, and made him say the answers that I wanted. It was kind of comforting. Anyway, I also practiced allot and became really good, so when little kids came over, I put on shows for them and stuff. And to think of it, I was scared of this doll!!!!So it is a really good thing to buy and all, and much better than a barbie or a fashion doll with weird clothes.So thanks if you read this. By Charlie and Avrlz."
4,Nice beginners ventriloquist doll,I bought this for a four year old little girl. For the money it is durable and fun to use even for someone who is four!! She loves the doll to play with and will get better at using it for it's intended purpose with practice!
3,16 INCH CARBON STEEL WOK,ITs okay make sure you keep the wok oil up and really fallow the set up derections otherwise it will RUST!
2,hey I know why this book is out of print!,"This book doesn't have very many examples and is excessively terse. It doesn't have many routine problems either; they're either hard or very hard, and no hints are included for any of them. I didn't think this book was very helpful at all. I used Jerrold Marsden's book as a reference & it was more helpful. The complex variables book by Brown/Churchill doesn't cover any of the topological concepts, but it's a good reference also."
4,Great watch for the money.,"So far it's a nice watch. The face is a little more colorful than the pictures would have you believe. It's also a lot bigger in real life. It has a Japanese movement, but what do you expect for under $100? I've banged it on a few things and it hasn't scratched yet. The lizard skin band is comfortable and attractive. Nice watch if you want something flashy and automatic for under $100."
2,A book for lawyers,I thought it was a book about incidents involving 911 failures and the aftermath. Instead it read like a book for lawyers with court cases and legal jargon.
5,A must read!!!,This is a must read for anyone who is undecided as to the necessity of having a gun for self defense. The stories are actually true. One of the stories happened in my hometown and I remember it well.
5,The Harsh Reality of Personal Protection,"Think dialing 911 will save your life, and that the local police are all you need for security and protection? Think again! This book will give you an education as to the law and police protection. It will also give you state by state samples of experiences to prove its point. Like one man said, 'You can call the police, and they will come - and take a picture of your dead body.'If you have fallen victim to Hollywood's depiction of the police always arriving just in time to save someone's life - you need to read this book! It will open your eyes!"
1,"Does not fit my computer, even though it says it does",The description for this battery states that it fits my Vaio laptop. It does not. Thanks a lot for the misleading description of your product. Disappointed.
4,cool cd for diehards,This is an interesting cd for L.A. Guns fans. It's all demo versions of the songs that ended up on the first record and several more that did not make it onto that record. The sound quality is pretty good and some of the tracks are significantly different than what ended up on their self titled debut. It's definitely worth buying.
2,Problem with packing,I returned this product because the bag was open when I received the package. I was very disappointed because I really wanted this product for my cats.
5,lipiderm,"This product is equally as fantastic as the lg breed variety. you will see results from lipiderm and it has NEVER given my dogs any stomach upset causing DIARRHEA. i have used other omega products in capsule and pure oil form and this brand I am most pleased with on any of my sized dogs. Even if you are feeding your dogs a premium diet such as myself feeding only holistic and organic dogs foods, this supplement you will see an even better coat. Any pets suffering from dermatitis or skin allergies must get this for their doggies."
1,Inferior Product,"Please see the review of a large number of Omega-3 / Fish Oil products on [...]. It's an independent lab which analyzes many supplements and supplement-like products, mostly human products, but occasionally veterinary. products. This particular product failed miserably. Please write your congress people and ask them to fix the rip-off portion of the supplement industry (like this and so many other products we're sold fraudulently) by requiring, at the very least, quality control measures, not just trusting these big companies because they sell us ""supplements"". This consumer abuse angers me."
1,Speed reading?,"I bought this audio book, popped it into the player and started listening....I swear this guy sounds like he is speed reading through this book. Very hard to follow and not at all enjoyable."
5,GIUSEPPE DI STEFANO--VOL. 1 & 2 NEAPOLITAN SONGS,WONDERFUL MUSIC--MAKES ME THINK OF WALKING THE STREETS OF NAPLES AND LISTENING TO MY FATHER SING TO ME. ONE CAN CLOSE THEIR YES AND THINK OF SITTING IN A RESTAURANT OR SIDEWALK CAFE AND BEING SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL ITALIAN PEOPLE.LOVELY SONGS SUNG BEAUTIFULLY
5,A joy to listen to,"This artist, though Sicilian, is the only opera singer able to understand and vocalize the passion of the Neapolitan song. Known for his perfect diction in opera, his Neapolitan dialect is as clear as day. I spent several years in Naples and learned to speak the dialect well enough to fool even the locals (I'm American-born, and not even of Italian-American ethnicity!) This knowledge of the Neapolitan dialect adds to the musical enjoyment of this disk."
5,Apt and Timely,"I cannot think of a more timely book than Second Acts. And what's more important,it delivers on what it promises. A must read for anyone who is even the least bit dissatisfied with their work."
