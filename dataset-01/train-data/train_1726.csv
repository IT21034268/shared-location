2,Boring!,"I would not recommend this DVD to anyone. It does offer variety with the seperate workouts, but they are not long enough and she is not motivating at all. I usually love kickboxing, but her version is just boring and hard to catch on to because she doesn't guide you into the moves. The best section is the boring ballet part. Don't waste your money."
3,"fun and cute, not the best programming, but ok","i really like the instrucotr michelle, she is good...i have her in one of my Leisa Hart videos from a Buns of Steel collection...this is a decent workout program....pretty neat, but not the best ."
1,I must be nuts,"but this tape is a major YUCK. NOT for beginers. And if youre interested in staring at a very physically fit AND BORING instructor, then by all means by the tape! 8 Min abs is a better choice and so are the 15 min workouts by Kathy Smith ""I want that body"" series. At least both Kathy and the 8 min crew adjust the workout to suit all levels, and can keep your interest. If you are uncertain about proper form and alignement, etc. This 10 min workout delivers yep, 5 10 minute BORING segments, w/out all the other good stuff that comes with working out/healthy fitness outlook. There are better ways to spend the 10 bucks..."
5,kickboxing,i had the vhs of the 10minutes solution that really helped me.until stop using vcr. it is better to play dvd. it's safer on dvd than vhs & dvd in in the market.
4,Good basic workout,"Good basic video that gives you an introduction to other types of fitness. The yoga 10-minute section really isn't a workout - it's just stretching. Abs are great for days when your workout doesn't use your core. The sides of my legs usually ache the day after the ballet workout. Kickbox and boot camp are too short for any real cardio benefits, but add to another video and you have a full workout. I really like Michell Dozois and have purchased some of her other videos after this. She's motivating without being fake cheerful."
2,Brief,"This video lives up to its claims in that it provide five ten minutes workouts. However, there is no warm up, so you would want to stretch or something before it starts. I could not integrate the 10 minute workouts, but if you are looking for something quick especially in the morning, this is for you."
2,Not good enough,"If you like 10 Minute Solution, I would recommend the cardio, kickboxing or sculpt DVDs where you can do all five of them and have a real workout. In my case, I have an unpredictable 1 and a half year old at home so I sometimes don't know how long I'll be able to exercise before she has a major infantile meltdown. So sometimes, I do 20, sometimes 30. If she's in a good mood, I can get in the whole thing. What I don't like about this tape is it truly is designed for 10 minutes. I don't think all five of the workouts do well together. And I didn't find any of them very intense."
2,"Workouts were just okay, but style is a dud","This is one of the worst put together exercise videos that I have ever seen. For starters, everyone else failed to mention that the camera moves while Michelle is moving. This makes you really dizzy just watching.Second, there is hardly any explanation given. Even if you're like me and watch it once beforehand to see what the workout is like, it's really hard to follow.Third, everything felt too rushed. In the pilates segment, for a brief moment you can see one of the cameramen holding up fingers to show Michelle how many repetitions were left. I guess we all know what she's interested in: hurrying up to go somewhere else.A much better 10 minute mix-and-match workout series is the QuickFix series."
5,Great variety,"I really enjoy this video because I can do whichever workouts I'm in the mood for. I usually do the fast paced workouts in one day, and the yoga, pilates and ballet another day, or I'll do ALL of them one day. I like it because I get bored really easy, so once I'm tired of boot camp, I can cool down with pilates and then beef it up again with Kickboxing!"
2,Too Easy,"I thought this video was far too easy. I did not feel that any part of my body was being worked by any of the exercises. After combining all of the exercises together, I still did not feel or notice a difference."
5,I love 10 minute solution!,"I had this vhs years ago and was thrilled to find it again on dvd. I especially like the dvd because you can customize your workout. I have since bought all the 10 minute solution dvds but this one remains my favorite.I like this instructor a lot. She cues well and is understanding of modifications.My only complaint is a small one. On the ballet section, which is my favorite, I wish they had used ballet music instead of the techno-beat music they used. It distracts from the ballet workout. Other than that, excellent dvd!"
3,10 Minute solution.,"I loved the 10 min ballet section, and the 10 min yoga were very relaxing and felt calm afterwords, nice stretching. Ascpecially after a hard workout, e.g running, you can put on the yoga part and stretch out and feeling good:)."
2,Not very effective & hard to use,"I really am not a fan of this video. The exercises are not in a very logical order and not long enough to really get much out of. Also, if you find that you only like a few of them, you constantly have to fast forward to get to the ones you like. And, to be honest, I just found it to be pretty boring."
5,works good!,"keep it clean and it will provide you with excellent service. we treat the case as well as we treat our camera and the case provides us with clear as day underwater photos and above water photos. it is difficult to see the display in bright sunlight, but this has nothing to do with the case, it has to do with the bright conditions outside, above water, when trying to review your last shot. so with a big memory card, just shoot more pics. the case stays closed real good and is easy to use overall. every button is available to use while in the case! even with gloves on it works. i love the fact that the camera goes everywhere now, it opens a whole new dimension. the quality is pure canon, very very good."
5,Worth It,"I live in CO at a major ski resort. I take my camera with me every time I go out, whether it's snowing or sunny skies. This case protects the camera well, and removes my worries about taking my camera into the elements. I can also use every function of my camera without removing my gloves, so my hands stay warm while filming. It's definately worth the purchase, as it adds range and flexibility to the camera."
2,OK for one chord,"I was hoping for a lot more harmonic progression. Listened to this once and not sure I heard much besides the tonic chord. Maybe there's some great subtlety I can't hear at low volume?? Or maybe the king's new clothes aren't really there. (Funny how many people compare today's ""serious"" music to the Emperor's New Clothes!) Not sure why this music is compared to that of Glenn Branca, whose music is SO much more interesting."
3,This Production is from the 1950's,"The acting is the strong point of this version of Don Giovanni. The real trouble is that though the singing seems quite well done, particularly the male roles, the sound quality is really poor. It is probably worth watching just to see the excellient way Siepi plays the Don, but the soprano voices particularly suffer from the acoustics and/or the recording. The orchestra is often recorded too far forward which also obscures the vocals. Really, your purchase of this video will depend more on whether the historical interest is enough to offset the very real deficiencies in the sound."
5,Best recorded performance of Don Giovanni HANDS DOWN,"Furtwangler, the only composer to rise against the Nazis and defy their order in Germany also conducted an amazing performance of Don Giovanni here. This is probably the BEST recorded version of Don Giovanni and the performance is top notch. By the way, the sound quality is excellent, even if it is in mono, you don't even notice. Don't ever let this great DVD pass you up, the performance, music, and conducting is one of the best you'll ever get to see. True piece of art."
5,Excellent Historical Don,"I have to sacrifice doby 5.1 and 16x9 screen to see this historical video. Siepi was my first Don and finally I can see him life anytime in my living room. The singing was first rate especially the ladies. Lisa della Casa is breaking my heart singing ""mi tradi"". The DVD is in color and excellent mono sound. Any Don enthusiast should immediately buy this DVD."
2,At least four other videos are better,"I didn't like this performance other than Siepi who was OK. Lisa Della Casa is one of the most irritating sopranos I've ever heard other than Mari Zampari who is at the top of my list of singers to avoid. The acting was corny because of the dated performance (1954), sound quality was certainly not up to my standards of acceptance. This is a Don I'll gladly give away to someone who can appreciate it because I couldn't. I don't recommend unless someone wants to collect a historical performance of Don Giovanni on DVD. The other four available are far superior."
1,Don Giovanni / Furtwangler,"I am disappointed with the CD. The problem is that it was not filmed in front of an audience. This means that there are no curtain calls or applause at the end of acts or after an aria is sung. This, in my opinion adds to the enjoyment of the opera."
1,Sound quality IS important!,"Wonderful picture quality, act, interpretation, directing... but awful sound quality in MONO!!! I was expecting more from this DVD."
5,It is a sight to see,This video ranks as one of the best videos of all time. The collaboration of styles and flavors is a perfect blend of technical and basically big skating. Heath Kirkchart deservingly won best video part of the year for this. His style is to be touched by none and all the people in this video are totally great. Henry Sanchez takes incredibly difficult tricks and just makes them look like childs play. John Cardiel rips it like none other. He is an amazing skater who can be apreciated by just about anyone. If you are a fan of skateboarding even if you're not you will LOVE this video. The montages are the best I've seen in a skatevideo.
4,Pleased,"This item was just what I thought it would be, the quality and usefulness. It was purchase for a gift and it was well received."
5,This is Fritz 6,"The Fritz 6 engine and current interface with a database of mates in 1, 2, & 3. 300,000+ game database as well. This is a great trainer and sparring partner for less than $10. It will crush anyone including GMs. The current version is Fritz 8."
3,The program is very difficult to navigate,The chess play is top notch but the program is difficult to navigate and use to its full ability. The help option is useless for trying to figure out how to use the program better.
3,it's okay,"It's decent. Not great by any means. The user interface is very difficult to figure out. ""Grandmaster Chess 10th ed."" is a far superior chess game.... far!"
5,Good for the price.,"You get the fritz 6 engine in what it seems the fritz 7 interface. You get also the nice analysis features typical of fritz.A real bargain for less that 10$. (Also take a look for the ""Fritz Grand Master Challenge II"" , - or ""Fritz Chess 2"" -), a posterior release of this title."
5,Awesome Servo,I have installed these servos on two of my larger jets. They do not chatter like some of the HK metal gear servos and they respond very well under high wind load conditions. They are too heavy for small planes but they are worth the price for anything over 25 oz.
3,It's thin,"When you use this glue and they say it's super thin believe it! It almost comes out like water. It's clear so it will dry without showing, and it bonds like a champ, but be ready with some napkins or towels to wipe up the excess. I personally used it to bond plastic to rubber to fix a volume button on my iPod stereo and it worked perfectly. I just wish it was thicker so I didn't feel like I was splashing it everywhere."
5,Memorable children's book with an international flair.,"Richard Scarry has been captivating children for years with his bright, busy illustrations and childlike optimism. Adults now nearly thirty want to give this book, particularly, as a gift. I'm a children's librarian and have had a number of requests for this book. I hope the publishers will consider reprinting it."
5,Loved this book,"Wow! I can't belive this book is not in print. I loved it as a kid and was hoping to get one for my new baby. My sisters and I loved reading this stories. It's too bad we don't have our old copy. Publishers, please bring this book back!!"
5,My favorite book as a child--Please reprint!,"Like everyone here, I was surprised and dismayed to find out that BUSY BUSY WORLD is no longer in print. Our family travelled all over the world, and living everyone from England to Iran to Australia, I wasn't unhappy, because Richard Scarry suggested the world was a charming, interesting place full of, well, busy people (Richard Scarry liked to do books about getting things done--I can also recommend WHAT DO PEOPLE DO ALL DAY?), and so it was. I bought a copy for a friend's child sometime in the mid-1990s, and had I known it was going to go out of print after that date I would have bought a second copy for myself. I will certainly buy one if it is reprinted."
2,gift of sex,"this book is very helpful for both of us,we love to read this book together and try everything they mention...lots of fun!"
3,The Gift of Sex,"The book was in great condition and was delivered quickly. The content wasn't what I was anticipating, but that's my own fault for not having done more research. I have no complaints at all about the seller."
4,Comprehensive Guide,"A great survey of how to approach sexuality as well as how to deal with some of the most common problems. The Penners emphasize that our sexual desires are God given and should be embraced. One of the more difficult concepts is the idea that we should be more concerned about our sexual pleasure than the pleasure of our partner, even though there are many references in the book to finding out what pleases our partner and then incorporating that into lovemaking."
5,Excellent,I recommend this book to individuals getting married and those that have been married a while but need a little UMPH in their sex life.
2,Be careful,Had to get for online school and the page numbers were not visible so I had to purchase a nook book to do my paper
5,I think it will be fabulous,"Hi! My name is Chloe and I love Barbie Mini Kingdom. I don't have this yet but it's on my wishlist and I really want it! It comes with:MirrorVanity stoolDragonBrushBarbie of course!!That's it. I think it would be really fun to get this because you can play with it with your Littlest Pet Shop, Calico Critters, Polly Pockets or My Little Pony. I might not get the horse and carriage though--I'm getting Snow Day Lila and her horse-drawn carriage will probably fit these dolls (I might be wrong, the BMK carriage is bigger than the Polly Pocket one).Oh well.Have fun with your new Rapunzel doll!I hope I was helpful."
5,One of the best,"Basicly the subject is living in New York City as Harry Golden and the people he knew experienced it.Each chapter stands alone as an essay.I read this book years ago and its companion volume (Only in America) I thouroughly loved these books , even though I have precious little in common with the author. There is a timeless and universal quality to the observation of life as people live it , even if they are miles , years and culturally remote from the life I live. It is easy reading and also thought provoking what a combination this is.If you find a copy ,read it , you won't be sorry.This is an American classic anyone can read."
2,When Dull Books Happen to Interesting Premises,"To start with, I'm one of those Science Fiction readers that really likes the fiction, and not so much the science. I give it the college try, but only the basic concepts really sink in. And for this book, most of the science went over my head (more than enough for me, but apparently not enough for the seriously die-hard readers of Science Fiction). But the overall idea, one of the only viable time-travel-like premises I've yet encountered, was very interesting and innovative. And if this book had been about 100, maybe 200, pages I'd give it a 5 and have been quite happy about it. But unfortunately this novel rambled on for over 500 pages. So to most of you I'd say, read the synopsis and be done. You won't miss much."
1,Junk a waste of paper,"I read this book for an English class about Science ficton. The premise of the book should have been good. Time Traveling, paralal Universe etc yet the author does not devlop the people in the story nor does he make it intresting. A buch of gobaly guke. Every single person in my class which ranged aroung 25 to 30 people said the book was a waste of paper and to never use it."
3,The punch never came.,Everything is set up midway through the book. It could have ended right there and you wouldn't have missed a thing.
1,"Don't waste your time, better SF are available","1. This book actually tells you what food items are available in a restaurant menu!2. This book is not environmental friendly, because only 10% of the 400 pages tells a story. The rest are 'noises'. Refer to point 1.3. On average, I read the first 50 pages, then 2 paragraph subsequently and last 20 pages. And I'm still able to follow its plot.4. The science idea is not bad though.5. If ice age come and I need to burn something to keep me warm, this book will be the first.6. I should not judge a book by its Nebula award.7. You may want consider Ben Bova's book. Your time investment may be more worth it."
2,It's a 100 page novella...,"...buried in 500 pages of tiresome drivel.Fortunately it's easy to skim through or even skip 30 or 40 pages at a time without missing anything ""important."" I gather the author is a college teacher and he's larded the book with endless, mundane details about life in academia. Some authors, like John D. MacDonald or Raymond Chandler, brought their stories to life with accurate descriptions of places or times; Benford, unfortunately, decided to unload his accumulated store of meaningless trivia into this novel and he is not a good enough writer to make it at all interesting."
5,Addictive,"I have read this book three times, and will read it again in the future. The problems of time-travel are usually skimmed over in science fiction. Like, what if you go in the past and change a circumstance, then that will change the present too, and your present situation. So what then? I loved this book. I liked the character development, the scientific explanations, the paradoxes involved with changing the past."
2,How did this win the Nebula Award?,"Good concept, but half the book could have been removed and it would be just as good. The story is cluttered with dinner parties, trivial family matters, and ralationships that are of no interest."
1,Way too much character development -- and no action.,"1st, I understand what the author was trying to do -- create realistic characters and really try to get the science into science fiction. 2nd, I didn't find this book unbelievably dull because I didn't understand it - I got good grades in Physics at UCB. Anyway, the premise of sending messages back in time to save a dying world is a good one. However, after 200 pages of the characters who were receiving the messages not understanding what was going on (while character exposition in both times was pounded into the ground), I started skimming. Well it was over 400, yes 400, pages into the book before the scientist in 1963 finally began to piece together what might be happenning. About 70 more unsatisfying pages until it ends. Also character exposition gets kind of dull when none of the characters are really likable."
3,"Good idea, but a little boring","The idea of the book is very good and it could have been a great novel in the style of John Brunner's ""Sheep look up"", also because the physics behind the tachyon-time-travel-idea are treated quite professionel during the whole book. But there a quite a lot of chapters where nothing happens and which seem to have little to do with the story, so the book gets boring sometimes. So if you skip all these chapters, you're going to read and interesting time-travel book!"
3,Slightly Out-Dated,"Benford's Timescape, considering its age, is still one of the better science fiction novels. Sense of desperation created by the conflict of the story is as real as can be. Supported by believable casts, the plot progresses along smoothly for most parts. At certain lengths of the book, one might become frustrated with Benford's tendency to beat arond the bush. The ending becomes painfully obvious half way through the book and loses its momentum. While the science behind Timescape is tremendously interesting, some readers may find it a chore to finish reading."
2,THIS was worth a Nebula award??,"So Gregory Benford is a physicist himself. Great! I can appreciate a scientist dousing a sf story with mounds of science. But - hey - how much? He must have thought his characters needed - well - character. So he heaps day-to-day ennui upon ennui. Was he paid by the word? And for story? This is FICTION. Why not make it fictitious? Except for a really GOOD idea of a time traveling Morse coded message where was anything outside of ORDINARY? His details of his characters life becomes ponderous, while his details of what should have been interesting were scant. How about the ""Central Park bomb""? (only one mention). The Kennedy fictionalized assassination went on for pages. Then it was followed by the vaguest hints of JFK's recovery and continued presidency. BIG DEAL!! 500 pages of waiting and wanting to understand why this thing won a Nebula."
2,Hard SF too hard for this reader,"I have found that I am much more a fan of ""Socialogical"" Sci Fi, works like Ender's Game & Mote in God's Eye. I admired Red Mars but the Science grew tedious for me. I found the same reaction with Timescape; a good effort at illuminating complex science with characters personal conflicts. I just couldn't get into it. I also found myself skimming through whole passages and found the central conflict not interesting. I wouldn't say this book is horrible, just not my cup of tea. I guess the closest comparison I can make is to ""the Forge of God"" but with a lot more science (I'm actually a huge fan of Forge). And, SPOILER:I also don't believe that if JFK were not assassinated, the world would be an utopia. I'm not a right-wing JFK hater, I just don't believe one President can bring about paradise (as far as bringing about misery, that's another story)."
2,Lame poorly developed love story,"Timescape won a Nebula award in 1980 or so and also won some other literature award. It was supposed to be a cross between literature and science fiction. Sadly, the ""literature"" part of the novel is a lame poorly developed love story about people you will grow to hate because they are so annoying. There is a modicum of decent science here, but that is all. The most annoying part is that it is some so damn depressing. Maybe if Benford hadn't set it in 1998 and have the world ending in a ridiculous environmental catastrophe, I would have liked it a bit better."
2,abysmal combination of attempted plot and hard science,"I didn't care about the characters, they were all two dimensional and unlikable, and the science, while hard, was so inadequately explained or connected to the plot that it was surplusage. Despite the nebula award, don't waste your time or money."
4,The Art of BMX,"I was looking for something new to do. ESPN's X-Games showed me the light. It was time for me to get into bmx. I decided on bmx over skateboarding due to the fact that I found the bike more useful in everyday life. Having ignored the bmx craze in grade school, and then ignoring the skateboard and bmx scene in highschool/college, and having no friends who give a hoot about bmx I was on my own.So I bought the DVD. Who better to learn from then the Miracle Man himself, plus I bought a Mirra 540 bike.The DVD starts off with basic flatland tricks (most useful to me, bunnyhop, 180, 360, bar-spinning) and then moves onto ramp/vert (of no use to me, but still interesting). The pace is quick though and the DVD is not long.You can watch it all you want but practice is what is really needed. If you have firends who bmx and you can already do the basics, skip the DVD.This DVD is more for the true beginner."
5,Highway to Heaven - Season Three,Thoroughly enjoyable wholesome entertainment. I always feel good after watching. I love every episode on DVD and watch them over and over. You just can't get GOOD entertainment on TV or DVD like this anymore. :-) You never know if you have entertained angels.... according to the Bible they do come down to earth... :-)
1,Too Expensive!,"I will not be purchasing this DVD box set, at over $60...way too expensive. I have purchased seasons one and two because they were reasonably priced. Amazon needs to reduce their price on this one!"
3,Closed Captioning?,"If this third season is not released with closed captioning, like the first two seasons weren't, then I won't be purchasing this. They can be recorded off TV Land with Closed captioning!!Far too much swearing in some episodes for my taste so I need closed Captioning for the TV Guardian to work.otherwise an excellent series."
2,Seems contrived,"This channeled book is apparently quite famous, but I was disappointed. Much detailed information about the metaphysical organization of the cosmos, particularly that includes hierarchy, is always suspicious to me. It is too easy to make that up, and also it avoids the real issue and purpose of channeling, which is to teach human beings something important and useful that they do not already know, something they can use to make a difference in their own lives, and something that will improve the condition of man. Another inherent and important purpose of channeling is to change the thinking patterns of the channeler and of others who read the channeling. I do not see any of that in this book. In other words, I see very little wisdom in it. I found the information in this book useless and, because it suggests that there is a spiritual hierarchy in the nature of reality, I find it highly suspect of being untrue and invalid channeling. True spiritual teachers do not teach hierarchy."
4,Bringers of The Dawn Teachings from the Pleiadians,"Gets off to slow start, but with promiseof greater understanding.Purchased at AmazonClean and in very good conditionHave just started this book and usually enjoy books of this nature.However,find this book to be far reaching with far to much description.In fairness having a preference for books to be less descriptive orrepeated in description. It tends to get off to a slow start. Must say it does not holdmy attention as would like for it too. Have always considered books of all genresbe well written and grab your attention immediately. This being said, to be able tograsp what the Author has tried to convey. Will continue to read this book. For assurance ofa message of great meaning. Would suggest readers use patience in the reading of book.Not all people will enjoy the nature of this book. However,must have an open mind to absorbwhat is being written."
3,Pondering the premise,I am still only in the first part of the book so cannot give a complete review at this time
5,Great book!,"Great book! Great info! Easy to read and understand. Got few for my friends and they love it too. Gonna get other books from Barbara. If you looking for more stuff like this check ""KRYON"" series"
5,Boy will this book make you THINK!!!!,"Or perhaps, be freer from your patterns of thinking. I love it because it helps me transcend my own logical traps. It's transforming, in a freeing way. It's a tool to get past your own traps for yourself. Not necessarily to be taken literally, lol. GOOD LUCK!!!!"
5,"Awesome book ,may cause interesting things to happen to you!","Amazing things happened to me while and/or shortly after I read this book. I felt my spine tingle with energy while I would sit reading this book. While sleeping I had what I feel was a precognitive dream about my writing a spiritual book that helps people. While sleeping I also had 'experiences'not dreams, of my being in the presence of white robed masters/teachers. They were in a semi circle teaching me things. When I awoke in the morning the word 'energy' was stuck in my mind. For at least 3 mornings in a row, I woke up feeling tired, like I was worn out from learning things at night. I felt like I didn't get any sleep. The only thing I remember being taught about is 'energy'. I am curious to know if anyone else has had strange/wonderful things happen to them from reading this book."
5,"Very good, very important book !","This Book is a gem, it is a true message put in a very comprehensive and understandable format. I feel blessed to have found this book !"
5,Very open minded....,"It did open my eyes for possibility that we can't imagine. Understanding of things that are going around us that we can't explain and if we're reading about messages from other civilization it does make more sens...why things are the way they're today in the world, why there is so much lies and corruption....and who really are we.....i love it to open my mind to all of this that Barbara wrote in her book....just great that we have people here on this planet that can explain to us why and what is happening...."
4,"The original is the best, downhill in other books","This is one of the best and most important spiritual books around. If you can get the audio of this you will find something that you can really grow your consciousness with. Highly recommended.However, the author's other books are not up to the same level. Something happened later. Beyond this first book I cannot recommend this channel today. Apparently in the 90's the focus changed from light and love to focusing on what the dark side is up to.If you want to know what the Pleiadians are saying today the purest channel I know of is Alaje. You can find Alaje on you tube."
1,Move over Scientologists....,"Every page (though well written) made me think CULT CULT CULT as I was reading about these mystical beings (E.T.s) and their Creator. If your life is empty and you are looking for a book on magic to fill the empty void with empty calories...buy this book. If you are looking for new age spirituality, you can find sources that are better, and much, much more believable."
1,...,"well i first heard of All Stars when Sandy, Becky, Thalia and the boys were starring in Star Street... As i adored that TV show, i bought their first single, Things That Go Bump In The Night... I, later on bought their album, but was really disappointed, as TTGBITN is the best song, and about the only one i like... but then, this is not surprising, because i usually listen to rockier stuff...so my last words are that, if your a big fan of pop-music, buy it!if your not that much of a pop fan, avoid it!!"
3,It's OK,"The first half of the book was very good, but the last half did not keep my interest. I finished reading it because I never leave a book unfinished even if I don't care for it."
4,Definitely unusual,"Unusual plot - this book got it all, from witches and angels to zombies and stealth bombers.I enjoyed the reading."
2,gave up on it,This one didn't grab me. 37% of the way in I gave up on it. Sorry it was simply a trudge to get that far in.
2,Book okay,I lost interest in the second part of book. I really did not want to contnue reading it however i do not like to leave books unfinished so I FORCED myself to finish it. The only thing I really liked about this book is that it was only .99 cents.
3,Weak,"I'm sorry if I offend any Evergrey fans but I happen to be one too and I have reviewed ea of their previous five albums and this is by far thr weakest one. This is just not up to the standards set on great albums like Inner Circle and In Search of Truth.I must have listened to this thing twenty times and nothing and I mean nothing caught my attention. I used to brag how Evergrey has never made a bad album. Well, they have now! For old times sake I'm generosly giving it three stars."
1,Evergrey sells out - horrible album,"I'm an Evergrey fan for life. I love all of their albums but Monday Morning Apocalypse is ridiculous. This is an attempt to break in the mainstream with pop music production, 3-minute songs, and lazy songwriting. Tom Englund's voice has been sadly killed and there are no more keys that made their earlier albums special. This being their last album on InsideOut, they obviously wanted to aim for the US market like their friends In Flames. The guitars are watery and weak too. I am terribly disappointed. Don't believe those who say this album rules. They are fanboys. I know better than that."
2,Why the change??????,"Metallica screwed up BIG time when they spewed out the garbage called Saint Anger to their millions of fans (who made them what they were...but they forgot!).Evergrey does the SAME with this ""stuff""!Why do these bands...change their style of music?Did the fans ask them to?NOPE!Aren't WE the reason they have money/fame?Then give us what we paid for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Disappointed,It's not a bad album but compared to their other material it is very weak. I think there are 4 good songs on this cd and the rest are pretty bland. There are some nice guitar solos. The effects on Tom's voice are annoying and Jonas (their drummer) is lackluster in his playing.
4,Not Perfect but......,"...good all the same. If this had been Evergrey's first album and then Recreation Day, there would be a group of mucical knowitalls proclaiming ""what have they done? where is that raw sound that MMA had? why are they being so experimental with the long songs and keyboards?"" Get over it, listen to it as it's own album, it gets better with more listens."
3,Doesn't live up to thier past work...,"This album has had a greatly mixed response. Many say it is a bold change from their previous albums that takes the band to whole new levels. While the album is different, it lacks the showcase of technical skill that earlier albums were made of, and that got Evergrey where they are today. Many people will enjoy this brand of metal a great deal, but it does alienate those fans, like myself, who loved Evergrey because they did a technical, dark, progressive style of metal like none other. Its not a shame that Evergrey has gradually changed their style over the last 2 albums and are trying new thing, but it is unfortunate that many Evergrey fans now have nowhere to turn for the kind of music that Evergrey used to create so masterfully."
4,Everybody loved it,I ordered this sign to hang above our coffee pot here in Afghanistan and the dudes thought it was funny as hell...since we live off coffee to work 18 hour days. KEEP WORKING! Sleep when you're dead!
2,New Product Quality,"I understand if I purchase a Used item, that it may be slightly damaged depending on the rating. When I purchase a New item, I naturally expect it to be in mint condition when it arrives. I bought this tin sign New from Sword Demon, and when I opened the package it had several dents in it. I was very disappointed and will not be buying from Sword Demon again."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED.,"I ordered this product and another tin sign that said ""if you're not shaking, you haven't had enough coffee"" for my grandmother for Christmas. I ordered these products on 12/9 and they have changed the shipping dates TWICE ON ME ALREADY!!! It started out as being shipped through 12/9 - 12/15, which was fine with me. It is now supposedly being shipped on the 12/15 - 12/20. I would have NEVER ordered these products if they were not to come by Christmas. It even says when you order the product that it should be here by Christmas. I will NEVER NEVER NEVER order from here- sent them a message asking what was up TWO DAYS AGO AND I NEVER GOT A REPLY!!! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE- THEY HAVE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND OBVIOUSLY DO NOT CARE ABOUT GETTING THE PRODUCTS HERE BY THE TIME THAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. Very disappointed and will not be ordering from here again. If I could, I would give this company minus 5 stars. They don't even deserve one star."
4,Pleasent in an old fashioned way and you can't argue with the advice,"I pulled this one out after Christmas and just needed some variation from some of the stuff I read. I'd read it years ago but it did my heart good to get a refresher of sorts on family, marriage, work life and what is important when all the dust settles. It is scripturally based but not overly so - just offers some sound advice that if we followed it this country would be a lot better off."
2,solid ink printers smell like crayons,"I just bought a Phaser solid ink printer. It smells like crayons. I will have to return it because everytime it goes on, it aggravates my asthma. Do not buy this for a small office or one without constant ventilation."
4,Bought for 4yr old grandson,These were a big hit with my grand-son age 4. He wears them over his bicycle helmet and they do not obstruct his vision.Great product!
3,Quidditch Goggles,This product is a very neat collectible. I bought it just to used it for the winter season ._ .It fogged up and became unbearable to see.Don't use this product during the winter like me.
2,Still in Shock!,"I saw the Boston Lyric Opera production of this opera on Jan.30th, 2000 and don't quite know what to make of it. Yes, the music at times was compelling and dramatic but the opera as a whole left me with a feeling of shock and disbelief. To go from the previous work done in boston ""Aieda"" to this, is taking a quantum leap, one whose journey I don't think I want to take again."
5,Haunting & unbearably beautiful,"Until I heard this opera I always thought of Glass as an intellectual exercise for the ears -- interesting but mainly a demonstration of style. But with Akhnaten I felt the yearning of a soul four thousand years dead, about whom we can know so little and for whom we feel such empathy. The juxtaposition of narrative voices, ancient Egyptian chants and counter-tenor hymns are unbelievable. For me as a Jew it was especially touching to hear both the complaints about the Apiru (Habiru) and the faint echo of the future (Akhnaten's distant future, our distant past)in the psalms that mirrored so exactly Akhnaten's own words. This piece takes my breath away."
4,Akhnaten is the best of orchestral Glass.,"After purchasing Philip Glass' Akhnaten, I must say that it shows his mastery of orchestration. Whoever knew this guy knew how to write a trumpet fanfare?! Glass' use of the countertenor voice as well also leads to some great sonorities in the vocal sections. This CD is a must-buy for any Glass fan. It loses a star only because the meat of all the songs is available on Glasspieces and most likely ""Songs from the Trilogy."""
5,"Profound, disturbing, wonderful .....","This is some of the most powerful music I've ever heard. I was fascinated by the repeated first theme, by what I learn from Michael's review (March 8th) were the looping arpeggios. The counter tenor was beautiful but the music perhaps just a shade too ethereal for my current impression of Akhenaten - but maybe that's just where I am at the moment. Yes, to pick up on another reviewer's comments, the declamations in English were pompous; but they were so reminiscent of the commentaries at the Karnak and Giza son-et-lumieres that they felt right. It's hard to tell without seeing the action, of course, but there was a sense of a huge build-up, starting from a climax and going up from there and then suddenly 'Is it all over?'. A day after hearing it through, I'm still disturbed and moved by the music - and that's never happened before!"
4,Can't wait to see this opera!,I was mesmerized by this music - it is haunting and spiritual. A recording does not do this opera justice. I am seeing the production by Chicago Opera Theater in July and can't wait to experience the dramatic visuals created by Mary Zimmerman to go with this amazing sound.
4,Use water with these,They say you do not have to but I recommend using water with this item. It helps minimize the wear on the disk. When used dry they get eaten up pretty quick and they are not cheap.
3,beautiful watch but...,"i love the ""design"" of this watch, but find it a little impractical because it has no light. with the cool reverse lcd display, it is almost impossible to read in low light situations. so in the end it isn't good for everyday(night) use."
3,Stylish,"+Case is not big and deep. It's good if you are looking for a small sized watch.+cool looking, stylish watch.+light in weight-hard to see numbers in low light.-dial window reflects light sources.-elasticized band is very tight despite my arm wrist is small."
4,"So ""devilishy"" cute!","I brought this for my daughter and she just loved. I think it is a perfect size and the lab created ruby has a lot of shine and sparkle for not being the real thing. I wish the chain was a little heavier but it still looks nice. Please note that the stone sits high in the setting. Check out the pictures I posted to see how it looks as worn. This is a great gift to give to that ""little devil"" in your life."
4,Cute,"This is a cute pendant and a steal at $63 shipped. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the gold chain is very thin but what could one expect at that price? For what I paid it's a good price for the pendant alone. I am going to use one of my own chains because I am afraid that one little tug and the chain will break and bye bye pendant -- that's how thin it is. Like the other reviewers, the pendant was larger than I expected. Don't get me wrong, it's not large by any means but from the measurments I was expecting something the diameter of a pencil eraser and it is a bit larger. I will take a picture within the next couple of days next to a dime for perspective and post it under user images."
3,Chain is a joke...,"The ruby heart devil pendant arrived this afternoon, in time for Valentine's Day, but I'll have to buy a new gold chain before I give it to my wife.The pendant itself is beautiful, and just as pictured, but the chain that came with it is of a thickness that is only about 1/4, or less, the size needed for a pendant of this size and weight.The chain is barely a ""chain"" and is far too small and fragile to use for any other application or purpose."
4,I LOVE IT!!!,"I think this pendent is adorable, I'm 28 and I love it. The pendent is very well made, not cheap and flimsy, sturdy. The stone is awesome, very clear, I think it has a dark pink hue to it that I like, I wear more pink than red. The chain is ok. The only reason it did't score a five is the clasp is kinda flimsy, It's not a lobster clasp or one of them that locks, it's the little circle with the pull back spring lever ones, you know, you use you'r thumb nail to pull back the lever and the little cicle opens up, you let go and it closes, not sure of it's technical term. I can't expect alot for $59.99 with shipping. BUT VERY WELL WORTH IT."
3,chain is a little thin,"I was pleased with this piece. The only complaint that I have is that the chain is a little thin and cheap feeling. The sapphire was clear of inclusions and a nice ruby and the setting was good. Overall, I thought that it was a good value."
5,Little Imp Necklace,This is my favorite piece of jewelry! I love it. It's a nice size and very unusual. It looks terrific with the ruby heart shaped earrings. I would highly recommend.
4,My daughter loved it!,Beautiful pendant and good price. The only thing I would complain about is the chain is way too flimsy and has to be replaced. But it was fast shipping and excellent product. Always satisfied when using Amazon.
2,Ruby Heart Devil Pendant,"First off it was shipped us mail and sat in my mail box along the hwy fortwo days with no protection. The box it came in was cheap looking. The pendantis hard to make out the devil horns and tail with out looking at it real close.the fake rubby looks good if you dont look to close. I bought it for my wife forChristmas I paid 140.00 us dollars and the day after christmas amazon had it on sale for 90.00 us dollars that burns my ass. My wife keeps it in her junk jewelry box not in her good jewelry box. Don't think she liked it much. Looks much better in Picture. A disapointing purchase all the way a round [[ASIN:B000NZX5ZY 14k Yellow Gold Lab-Created Ruby Heart Devil Pendant w/ Diamond Accent, 18""]"
4,Nice piece,"Length:: 0:51 MinsThis is a short video describing my opinion about the lab created ruby pendant with diamond accent on the 14k gold chain.14k Yellow Gold Lab-Created Ruby Heart Devil Pendant with Diamond-Accent, 18"""
4,devilish pendant,Love it!! Chain is a little dainty but I just changed it out and really love wearing it. It is an attention getter and people love to ask about it. I definately recommend it.
1,Not worth it,"I think the picture looks way better, it's really small and more for a little girl, the chain is way 2 thin so i changed it with another but it doesnt sit right on the chain and tips forward. i wore this for new years and nobody noticed wut it wuz they had 2 get real close to acually see it"
4,Cute Necklace!,"Cute necklace, the actual chain is very light and possibly easily breakable, so I have done what others have and placed it on a stronger gold chain of my own. The pendant is so cute and not big at all!"
3,"Nice Size, but looked a little plasticy...","Nice size pendant, the horns and tail are very subtle, which I liked, but the stone looked almost plastic-like. Perfect for a teen, or young teen, but my wife likes it and wears it often."
4,My Gal Loves it,"The necklace was a Christmas present for My Gal..She absolutely loves it..The Ruby is cut very nicely,and She has gotten many compliments on it.."
3,It's ok,"The chain is extremely thin, very dainty, and the pendent does not hang well, it wants to tip, top heavy.but it looks nice."
4,Devilishly Sweet,Gift has not been gotten to the recipient yet but I am sure she will love it. Good father to daughter gift!
2,Disappointed...,"Ordered this pendant for my fiance. The picture makes this look adorable, however, it is very tiny. It was so tiny that she wasn't even sure what it was at first and had to look at the picture. Further, when she tried to wear it the pendant will not lay flat.We returned it without issue and will keep looking."
5,awsome,"this 14k Yellow Gold Lab Created Ruby Heart Devil Pendant w/ Diamond Accent, 18 is hot its sexy its new you havent seen nothing like this befor."
3,Meh...,"The ruby doesn't look as deep and vividly red as a ruby should (in my opinion). It looks like a scarlet rhinestone, not an expensive lab created ruby. However, the overall appearance is enlightened with the horns and tail. Honestly, the tail (which held the diamond) was only pretty due to its gold plating. The 'diamond accent' looked like clear resin or glue they forgot to dab out of the spot. It's worth, $60, which I used my gift card on. Not worth the $120, or not at all worth the $400, but the appearance is cute yet mischievious. Still glad I bought it."
1,ruby heart devil,I bought this last year in Feb. and I went to put it on and the chain was broke off it. There is no way to fix it. Very upset about it because I really liked it.
3,Looks nice but is hard on chains,"Product looks great and is nicely constructed, the issue is that it falls forward when worn due to design flaw. Also the end of the tail get caught on and breaks chains. We solved the issue by having a hoop added to the top of the piece in order to pass the chain through. My wife loves it but if I had to do over I would not purchase again, adding the hoop and having broken 2 chains is just too much hassle for a $160 pendant."
2,jewwel too heavy for the chain,jewel was larger than shown. Also too heavy for the chain as it does not lay right (tipped) on neckline
3,"Cute but,",The way the chain is strung through the back makes it flip over too easily. Might have to add some sort of weight to the bottom or bend the mounts up a little to get it to stay in place.
4,Beautiful,The ruby is beautiful. The piece is so cute. My only negative thought is that the necklace was placed in a velvet bag for shipping. When it was received the chain was in several knots. I would think a box would have been better for shipping.
3,Nice,"Cute piece of jewelry. Quality is very nice. Received compliments on it. Wish the size was a little bigger and the chain could be thicker. Overall though, I'm glad I purchased it."
4,Loving it,"I got this for my daughter and she wears it every chance she gets. The ruby is a nice size and it is not so big that it would cause to much attention but when some one is up close they always catch a look and love it. I was alittle concerned with the chain which is very thin but is the right length. This is some thing that her friends now are asking about because they want one to. This is great for some one who is young at heart and does not to attract to much attention, with a over sized pendant so this is okay to wear with everyday things and at work and will still look acceptable."
5,On a small fishing village on the Outer Banks of NC,It's the story of a young first year college grad who agrees to teach in a remote area in order to get his tuition paid for. This is an absolute true story that happens to have been written about my family! You must try and find it as its now out of print. Sometimes you can get a used copy as I did! Just keep coming back to Amazon!
5,Inreresting and informative,"I was given a signed copy of this book by Stanley Green and loved it when I read it. Years later, aften running across it again, I reread it. It gives such a vivid description of the adventures he had after graduation from college and going to a very remote area of the Outer Banks of North Carolina to teach. It is so intereting and enjoyable I could hardly put the book down. I would label it ""easy"" reading. If you have the opportunity to purchase one of these books, I don't think you will be disappointed."
2,A legend in his mind only,"Why the 1939 Yankees ? - I guess because Tofel could get a book published about his own obsession with them. Not very convincing and if you need an encyclopedia of baseball writing cliches, Mr. Tofel supplies them !"
1,READ YOUR ITEMS CARFULLY,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MOVIE, IT'S DOCUMENTARY, I WAS LIVID, SO I'AM SENDING IT BACK. SO CRAZY BECAUSE I NEVERSAW IT ON THE IMAGE. SO PEOPLE, BE VERY CAREFUL TO LOOK AT THE ITEM FRONT AND BACK BEFORE YOU ORDER. BPARKER BALTO MD."
5,A elegant and nice watch,"I get this watch for my father's bday, was a great idea, is so nice and elegant, is a turneyes watch."
3,lots of close-ups of flora & fauna,"Focussing on Costa Rica's large national parks, this is a highly informative text with lots of color photos , mainly of the wildlife and plants found there. I would say it's aimed more at readers with a specific interest in the environment; tourists or armchair travelers would probably glean more from a Dorling Kindersley type book"
4,weird is cool,"If you like cars that are unique, this is for you. One won't find dull in this book of different vehicles. It is why I like it."
2,Title doesn't match content,"One would have expected to see some direct ties between Prince espousings and what Dick Morris has observed in his various capacities, but save the first few paragraphs in the intro which mention Machiavelli, the book is void of any reference to Machiavelli's theses. In terms of an expose on how present-day political adminsitrations reflect Machiavellian principles, it comes up short. It is more a giving of personal views and opinions of how politics should work."
3,"Do as I say, not as I do.","This is an interesting read. Morris describes how the new political system works. Since he and his best bud Bill Clinton upset the political formula in the nineties, this was something to behold.This book is chock full of good advice. I can repeat them here: have a message, focus that message to the voters, forget about the undecided-they don't vote anyway, stay positive, when the election turns dirty, focus on your opponents misrepresentations, etc. I don't think Morris actually followed this advice, but hey, what do you expect from a politician.I think this is sage advice. The messenger was bad. Americans don't like dirty campaigns. They want the message of what a person stands for. This is a book about how a good campaign should be run. For those considering running for an elective office, this is a very good read. It is Politics 101. I just wish the author was different."
1,A REVIEW BY LINKED CLERIHEWS,"Dick MorrisTries mightily to bore us---Often on TV,Where he's an intellectual peewee.And Dick MorrisWent with a whorris.His bookIs politics with a meathook.He's as much like Machiavelli,As is Tony of the Soprani."
5,Yea for Fat Albert,I was getting sick of the children's saturday morning cartoons showing today and decided to get my child this collection. I remember seeing many of these episodes and not picking up on the humor. Now I do. Can't wait to get the other episodes!
4,Fat Albert's Greates Hits The Ultimate Collection,I use these videos to supplement my Character Education Lessons. They are an excellent supplemnet for the students.
4,Review of Fat Albert's Greatest hits,I enjoyed it very much. I may buy more Fat Albert's Collection.
3,consumers beware,this product hardens fast. Be sure to ventilate. Use tools that you're willing to throw away. Clean up isn't easy. Drying/cure time varies.
4,DAP Plastic Wood 16 Ounce.,"Used this product to fill a large hole on my deck, not exactly per the manufacturers recommended use. It works like a charm, just be sure to put it down in layers to avoid an uneven or bulging surface. Sand once dry and stain to create a very good looking surface."
1,wrong advertising,"This item is too difficult for a six year old even though advertised as for ages 5-8. You cannot return the item once opened, so do not order."
2,Michael Kan is in this!,"We watched it just to see Michael Kan in this movie, so probably slightly biased by that. It's a style of comedy that normally wouldn't appeal, but we were entertained. Fun night!"
1,WHY???,"Flat out buffoonery, yet another black film embarrassing to the black race just like Soul Plane, Ride & Cookout. What a waste of film, actor's time & the money it took to produce this foolishness. From the very beginning it started off ridiculous."
4,"Great book, but...","This is generally a great read. However, I find the quantitative examples in Chapter 6 very confusing to follow. In addition, as a financial analyst, I feel very insulted for being called ""bean counter"" numerous times in the book. The author should be more aware of this demeaning attitude he carelessly imbedded in this otherwise great book."
2,dissapointing,"As a long time fan of George Thorogood, and a music video collector, I regret that I have to say - I found this video a little on the boring side. The set list is good and the performances are good, but I believe this video would have been much better if filmed in a different location, such as an intimate little club somewhere with a much smaller stage and more crowd excitement. If you're a Thorogood fan, this definitely worth having, but it could have been soooo much better."
4,The Baroness' favorite book...,"In the tradition of Rider Haggard's She, By The God's Beloved was the Baroness' favorite book. So whatever happened to the original Egyptians?

Well no, seems abunch oif them are rumoured to be living in a secret canyon somewhere in the Lybian desert. Armed with an ancient papyrus two friends Mark and Hugh set off to find them.

4,red light green light,"For little boys, and girls of course, this well illustrated and versed story takes us on a journey through traffic and transport. The prose is simple and rhymes so the kids can relate to it and the parents are able to add their extra bit or allow the kids to be taken away by their imagination. A new favourite in our household!"
5,Wonderful,"This woman really needs more recognition, she has a very beautiful voice. Her Skyrim songs on Youtube are absolutely amazing, as is this album. Support this artist.The Dragonborn Comes - [...]Age of Aggression - [...]"
4,Good Music,"Not a music snob here. Reading some reviews before my purchase, I got the impression some folks sit there with a score card or are judging Dancing With the Stars. My appreciation is more basic and I found this to be a very good set. The one drawback is when downloading into my MP3, the playlist installed on the CDs doesn't actually match the jacket cover. As played on the MP3 player, the sequence matches the jacket cover but not the downloaded playlist."
3,OUTDONE BY HISTORY,"ok.....this will do.....but I cannot call it favored....Toscanini and Szell owned this music when they performed it....the Third usually gets good performances by many conductors......Toscanini gave the Reformation fire that will never be equalled, even in an inferior sonic version of many years ago.....history forces later conductors to compete with the greatest of the great...impossible task....."
1,Caution,"When ""comprehension"" becomes ""understand"" we are going backwards. As an instructional designer and professor of cognitive psychology, I am horrified. Comprehension is measurable. Understanding is not."
2,SLOW,"I was enjoying the book up until about midway through when the author hit the breaks and the book came to a screeching halt. I read a lot and rarely have I ever put a book down, but I had to with this one. I might pic it up again later, but it got to the point that it was agonizing to try and plow through the slop at the midway point in this book. It might not have been so bad if the characters had some kind of personality and the author didn't go on and on and on about a scheme to trick one of the Scorpian clan's main rivals."
2,Below Average Fantasy Writing,"Despite the unusual setting and overall decent plot, I cannot recommend this first book in the Clan War series. I haven't read any of the others, and based on my experience with this book, I probably won't.I'll start with the good, though. The setting, Rokugan, a parallel-world medieval Japan, is fairly vivid. Knowing very little of medieval Japanese culture myself, I have to trust that it was a close enough approximation for the purpose of the story. Also, the plot is pretty decent, though very, very straightforward. I especially enjoyed the last few pages, after the battle.Unfortunately, I cannot say I enjoyed the writing. The characters were quite wooden, and the conflicts forced. The Lion (Toturi?) character was fairly entertaining to read, but the Scorpion king (ha), sort of a nobler Richard III, was not. I think the author let the setting run away with the novel a bit too much, and didn't rely enough on his own ingenuity."
4,"Dumb at first, but gets better...","I am just dabbling into this game. I'm not playing it, just getting the game books and reading about the world of Rokugan. I decided to get all the 7 L5R novels and read them before I continue reading the gaming manuals.Scorpion started out kinda [weak]. It seemed too much like a book made for a role playing game that was required to insert a catacomb here, some giant spiders there, and an ogre for good measure. Roll the dice to see how they fare.As I kept reading, the story got better. Things started to come together and the ending was pretty intense. I really want to see a live action movie or TV show version of this book. I'd even settle for a cartoon.I totally recomend this book. It ain't Tolkien, but it's still pretty fun. It's also much easier to read than the Lord of the Rings. I finished it in 5 days of 2 hour reads or so a night.On to Scroll 2: The Unicorn!!!"
5,Most RPG novels are just bad. This is a nice change.,"I play the rpg pretty heavily, but I have never followed the events the game. The book was well written and interesting. The characters were compeling and you do not need to know much about the world or samurai to enjoy it.If the series stays as strong as this first book, then this could be quite the epic tale in the making. I recommend this book immensly."
5,I used too,"have the whole series of them a long time ago as a child. I never knew it grew into anything more then just a book! I'm trying to get them all again just to re-read! This being the first book instantly sucks you into a secret, bloody, and beautiful world."
3,"Better, but not ideal","This keyboard is the best compromise that I've found, but it's not perfect.Pros: ALL keys are in the correct position (I had a Datadesk Smartboard, and the '=/+' key is on the left hand on that unit). Even the Insert/Delete/etc. keys are in the correct position.Cons: The spacebar is a little ""clacky"" as another reviewer said. The split could be angled a little more -- it's almost like they took a keyboard and pulled it apart in the middle. My unit is wobbly, so I put a penny under one of the feet.Overall it's a good value, but Belkin needs to do a little more work on the design."
5,The western world is missing out .,I totally agree with the previous poster.You need to read this book . The teaching in it will help in your spiritual walk with God and will lead you in the direction to know Christ better. I was introduced to this Sadhu Sundar Singh's books about 6 years ago and it has deeply affected me and helped me to have a different look on life and my relationship with God. It is amazing to read the change that Christ had on this man. Do a search on the internet for some of his writing.
5,officially sick tracks (O.S.T),"From begining to end, front to back this is a masterpiece and the best album they made period, it don't get no better then PUTS when it comes to underground rap. And like most of there albums there's nothing to skip, except maybe pausing to go get a sandwhich or snack then come back and finish listening.This isn't that mainstream lil John,jay-z,50 cent,Nelly,meek mills, Rick Ross,lil Wayne,drake etc.. Crap you see on t.v. Everyday, this that real hip hop reminisce of the 90's."
4,"Intelligent, Soulful, Creative Music","The People Under the Stairs have definitely created a soulful approach to rap music. This album is one of my favorites from the underground. I've been a fan of Central/southern California underground for a couple of years now, and I have to say that the region has produced more talented, creative hip-hop acts in the late 90's than any I've heard (i.e. Living Legends, The Pharcyde). This music has evolved from the literal and straightforward mumblings of early to mid-90's gangsta rap to intelligent, philosophical poetry over music. This is just another advancement."
1,big time garbage!!!!!!!!!,"this has got to be the worst Hip-Hop cd ever. the only track that's tight is the first track. this is a massive dissapointment if your a true Hip-Hop head you will understand when you listen to this cd. do yourself a favor don't cop this cd, if you do you will tell yourself i should of listen to that kat on the amazon reviews..."
4,MARQUSAS,"Survivor is the best show ever.The Survivor team really knows there stuff.Including of coarse the producer.All Survivor addicts like myself,and even if your not and watched other Survivors Survovor Marquesas was great.See how Boston Rob started out.Just cant say enough.Great.Great show"
5,"Please, Please, Please!",This was a great season! My father is a great fan of Boston Rob and nothing would make him happier to own this series! They should all be released. Amazon help us Survivor fans out ;-)
2,At least one scene deleted,"We loved Survivor Africa, and bought the DVD because we really, really wanted to see Frank do battle with his antlers again. We watched the entire thing and . . . no Frank/antlers scene! We are disgusted. No scenes should be deleted upon production of the DVD."
2,Worst Winners!!!!,Great overall season; however it produced the two worst winners ever in survivor history. Where are they now? I don't really care and I don't really want to know. Kathy should've won it - she had the best image transformation of the entire show. Would've been nice if Tammy and her original alliance got further into the game as they all looked very competitive and cut throat. I also liked that Watermelon Queen Girl. She was hot!!!
4,why arent they releasing any more seasons?!,"survivor Africa was ""ok"" it wasnt the best season but it was pretty good. [...]"
3,So far disc 1 bad...

5,Please,why is it taking so long for CBS to release survivor Africa I have been waiting for ever please get to it
5,One of the best seasons.,"I'm a SURVIVOR tragic...love EVERYTHING about the show and have long been waiting for the release of this great entry in the series. However, am disappointed that there are no commentary tracks. Would have been so cool to get someone like LEX sharing his thoughts about his time in Africa."
4,Worth the wait... sorta,"It's about time that the missing seasons of Survivor were released on DVD. Thanks to Amazon for getting this going. It is great to revisit one of the better seasons of this great series. The picture quality is excellent but the packaging is sadly kind of cheesy. There is no ""box set"" but rather three standard size dvd cases labeled part 1, 2 and 3. Each contains 3 discs with 2 episodes on each disc. I'm assuming that this is because these are DVRs. At any rate it is still great to finally be able to collect the unreleased seasons."
3,QUESTION ???,"Someone said that the ""reunion show"" was not included on the DVDs for Survivor Thailand.Is this true ?ALSO..... which other Survivor seasons DON'T have the reunion show ???"
1,WTF CBS???,Why the HE@# hasn't CBS released all the seasons of Survivor? I've been a huge fan from the beginning and have applied to be on the show before. I want a complete collection of ALL the seasons. DO YOU HEAR ME??CBS???
4,Yay!,"I love Survivor Marquesas, and I really enjoyed rewatching the season. I wish they had a box for it, like the other seasons that were released earlier on.My original shipment got lost, but luckily Amazon.com sent me a replacement order immediately."
4,Disgusted at Hold Up,"I'm very disgusted with CBS for not releasing this season. I bought it on eBay, thinking it was a legitimate copy. It was only when I got a pirated copy and complained that I was told ALL copies are pirated because the season hasn't been released yet.Because I have a strong respect for copyright laws, I have never watched the pirated copy I have right here in my house. But when CBS keeps putting off the release date, the temptation grows stronger.Last time I checked here on Amazon, there was a release date for late February this year. Now there's no tentative release date at all. I don't know what the reason is for stringing us along like this, but I'm royally disgusted."
4,The Best Survivor!!!!!,"My family, my husband, my two little kids, loved this season!!!When will it come out on DVD? Here is my vote for it to come out soon. For the finale, we decorated the house African style, and had a mini-desert! We loved it!"
5,One of the best!,One of the best of the Survivor series. I'm a first rate fan & I can actually recommend any of the seasons.
3,Yay for Survivor! Ehhh for season.,"As a superfan of the show, I'm really happy to see the release of Survivor Thailand. However, this season is Jeff Probst's least favorite season for a reason. The challenges were great, the location was great, the music was great, Jeff was great, BUT the cast was not. This is one of the most BORING casts of all time. With the exceptions of Helen, Ken, and Shii Ann, I think that most of this cast we could have done without. The Ted and Ghandia thing was a little ridiculous, Robb Z was ridiculous, Clay was just awful, and Jan was one of the stupidest players the game has ever seen. And on top of all those negatives, the winner, not saying who, just has a cake walk to the end. It does have its moments though, the fake merge, the lost boat, all of Helen's confessionals were great. I would say if you like Survivor and have yet to see it, buy it. Just don't expect a great season or great bonus features. No commentaries :( No updates on the players, its pretty bare."
1,Survivor Thailand,"I am a huge fan of Survivor, and like many have been waiting for new seasons to be released. I was so excited when Thailand became available and bought it immediately, even though it ranks low on my survivor season favorites list. I will definitely buy any season released. However, I was VERY UPSET that the discs froze or refused to load. I have had to return them and hopefully the replacements will work appropriately. Even with the inconvenience, I wait expectantly for the replacement and for more seasons to be released."
3,"Ok, But not the best Survivor Series","This Survivor series was pretty good up untill they put that obnoxious loud mouthed Rosie O'donnell in the reunion segment. Also If not for the racist and the gay back stabber, I would have rated this higher. Too much finger pointing and whining in this series. Check out the Africa series instead. That by far is the best survivor DVD!"
5,Good Boston Rob fun,"We bought this season to go back and see Boston Rob's first season, which was before we'd started watching Survivor. Totally worth it. There was a good mix of contestants on the season, good Survivor challenges...the stuff you like to watch as a Survivor fan."
4,have to have them all,"i am a huge survivor fan, could never play the game but i love watching the show. i would recommend this show to anyone who like reality tv."
2,Not the pack I expected,"Although watching this season in DVD Quality and with extras is a real pleasure (I'm actually enjoying it much more than the first time I watched it), the pack I received was not even a pack, but three packs altogether. I think they should have been putr together in the same box, since the effect on my shelf couldn't be more horrible..."
3,An OK season,This is a middle of the pack season. Didn't much care for Neleh. Paschal was lucky he made as far as he did. Boston Rob and Kathy should have been the finalists. They played the best.
4,Still Waiting...,"We have all the ""Survivor"" DVD sets and have enjoyed rewatching the heroes and villains but when is ""Africa"" -- one of the best seasons -- going to be realeased on DVD? Come on Burnett, work it out."
4,Very minor glitches,"Would have 5 star rating except for the fact that each disk had at least one glitch where it stopped and then restarted (very quickly). Other than that, picture and sound quality were great. Played on a Sony blu-ray to a 50"" Sony rear projection TV."
2,If you're watching all the seasons,do watch this one for continuity; but it has one of the most unlikeable winners ever. Interesting introduction to Boston Rob before he came out of the closet as a sociopath.
1,"Survivor, Marquesas (Season 4)","I ordered the disc set for Season 4 of Survivor, Marquesas. Everything was fine until we got to disc 6. The disc will not play, there is nothing on the disc.......... two whole episodes gone.......... This was supposed to be a new disc set, very disappointed on the quality or lack of QUALITY CONTROL..... then I contacted Amazon and told them about my woes, and in less that 12 hours, I have aq new disc set in the mail to me and free shipping to return the defective set. THANKS AMAZON.... Excellent Service!!!!"
3,Played like The Godfather but not as exiting,"Survivor Marquesas is the first season to actually almost have a blowout. In all the seasons before, the tribes were very close together (except for Samburu internally) and had an even to 1 player advantage. The Rotu's kept slamming the Maraamu's in the challenges. Anyway, if you notice right (and I mean same episode as) the merge, the story plays almost exactly like the movie ""The Godfather."" If you buy theSurvivor All-Stars - The Complete Seasondvd; you will notice on disc 7 they have promo's from the first 7 seasons. One of the promos of Marquesas is calling Rob ""The Godfather."" Watch the merge like thisRob: The GodfatherSean: Godfather's sonThe Rotu 4: The evil empireand you will see what I mean. The only exciting parts of this season were episodes 4-8 and the final 5-the finale. You should not buy this season IF you want to begin watching Survivor. If you are a fan BUY THIS NOW!!"
3,Loved it - Hated it,"I loved this movie, but I'll never watch it again. The ending is just way too sad. The acting here is top notch and the story is wonderful. I especially liked the short but impressive role of the German Mayor played by John Banner (aka Sgt Schultz). Seriously, the movie is brilliant and this may be Brando's greatest role, but as I said the ending stinks, kind of like All Quiet On The Western Front, but at least in that movie from the previous war to end all wars, you kind of knew all along that the dude was gonna catch it. This movie is a real tone setter, like listening to Pink Floyd's The Wall, first thing on a rainy Sunday morning, it sets the tone for the rest of the day. Great Flick - Horrible Flick. You have to see it, but I would suggest not buying it until you do. Look for it on AMC or something."
4,WW II epic drama,"Big, sprawling epic drama tracing the lives of three soldiers, two American, one German, throughout WW II. All three men are fighting personal wars within the context of the big one they are all involved in. Marlon Brando plays the German soldier who becomes disillusioned over the Nazi cause he's fighting for; Brando makes his character sympathetic in a way Irwin Shaw, who wrote the book the movie is based on, did not. Montgomery Clift is Noah Ackerman, a Jewish draftee, who must battle the Army's anti-Semitism before fighting the Germans, and Dean Martin is a pop singer who is also drafted, but has no strong desire to serve. Clift and Martin become friends and the movie unfolds toward the inevitable climax where all three soldiers meet outside of a concentration camp near the war's end. Over three hours long, the movie does at times seem to ""drag its slow length along,"" but the three principal actors are all excellent and keep us watching to the end."
4,different kind of war storey,"although a bit long, this storey of 3 soldiers in ww 2, is a good one, dean martin bascially plays himself...., (...)actormongomery clift plays a sulky character, and marlon brando plays a german officer diillusioned by his country's war machine. cameo appearance at the end by"" sgt shultz"" of hogan'shero's fame- actor john banner. made in 1958, this would have been a real gem if filmed in color."
2,Anachronisms Galore,"I have trouble with films with glaring anachronisms, and this one has them right off the bat. The initial scenes take place in Bavaria in 1938 and the clothes and hairstyles of the female characters are straight out of the late 50's. Ditto for the scenes showing the early to mid 40's. If I am not mistaken, in some of the scenes depicting the war years, some of the women's costumes had Dior's ""New Look"" construction, which was definitely POST war. So, a half baked attempt to be true to the 40's was attempted, but they got the timing wrong.More problematic for the plot is the female lead's prescience to know how bad Hitler was going to be--in 1938. Her whole attitude is of someone who knew the outcome of WW II, which she obviously couldn't have at that time. Avoid this clunker."
2,weak,"Two movies spliced together is what this one seems. Brando and Clift only meet in the end for two seconds. Weird structure for a film, and it doesn't work. And if Brando is such a great actor, how come he's so weak in this film and in DESIREE (which I just saw). In Brando's autobiography, he says he learned the trick of reading dummy cards on this film, instead of memorizing lines. Well, at least he accomplished something with this film."
1,Marlon Brando Makes You Und Offer You Can't Refuse,"In essence this shows how war can be hell. Brando plays a blond(ha!) Nazi who questions himself and his allegiance to the Nazi cause, he never seems to appear with other actors. The cast is also small with Dean Martin, Montgomery Clift and Hope Lange. Martina and Clift are friends and are drafted and end up together in the same unit where Clift finds jewish persecution is not occuring in Germany only and he continually fights every soldier. His wife, Lange is truly in love and sympathetic with his cause but warns him that if he continues he'll end up in the brig and never see is unborn child. The movie is trite and the only highlights are Martin(not singing or playing the stereotypical Italian) and Lange as the young bride! This is HOpe Lange's only B&W film and she was wasted in it as Clifts wife."
1,"Slow, boring, disappointing.","My husband and I are always interested in WWII movies. So when Mom, an ardent Brando fan, recommended this, we watched it.It's a long time since we did - perhaps as long ago as a year - but the impression is still with me that this movie had very little to do with The War - it was more about interpersonal relationships and character development. So in the way of being a War Movie, it was not so good. I think it was a rather long movie, too, which didn't help. We just kept waiting for 'something to happen' - and it never did."
5,The lions ROAR in style,"A classic. period. Any movie which has Brando and Clift deserves to be seen and they are brilliant in their respective parts.The movie is a great insight into the 2 sides of the war. All germans were not bad and brando brings that out in his depiction.The yanks were fighting the NAZIS (who were anti semetic), but the yanks were harbouring anti semetic feelings for clift's character of Noah in the film.Brilliant direction, a lovely background score and the greatest actor ever BRANDO, with another all time great CLIFT and a very likeable MARTIN, make this a classic true to life look on the war.A must watch."
3,"A minor , early war classic with two iconic stars of","the 1950's, Marlon Brando & Montgomery Clift. Then throw ina real movie star, Dean Martin cast as he put it as ""a like-able coward"". Likeable? Definitely. A coward? No. Dino befriends Noah Ackerman, played by Clift, a Jewish outsider, with a chip on his shoulder, before the war. They hook up again in uniform during the war. Noah is discriminated against & beat up by men in his own unit & his CO because he is a Jew. Dino puts himself on the line for his friend. It puts a racist face on our fighting men not often seen in World War II movies. Brando does a excellent job playing Lt. Diestl, a conflicted German officer. He is a sympathetic Nazi who doesn't always follow orders.This is a lost classic, a forgotten but good early war movie. With the death of Brando perhaps it will be rediscovered."
4,Absorbing and Intelligent War Drama,This movie deserves a place in the top 20 war movies of all time. Viewed now it is an intelligent study of the psychology of war and one asks the question is it necessary ?. The big factors of this movie are its excellent photography (great DVD transfer) and music score. Believe it or not Clifts performance was the only weak link
3,Operatic soap opera,"The VHS box calls this ""Romantic comedy at its finest."" And several reviewers have praised the film""s operatic music. Nonsense. This is a soap opera, featuring very little music, almost no comedy (especially if you find making fun of gays less than amusing), and lots of tears and angst. Yes, the movie does make a good point about the difficulties of unions and nationalities in contemporary opera. File that under ""labor relations"" rather than entertainment. And Glenn Close, as always, is a fine actress. But what a bore this film is. Who cares if the neurotic singer and the even more neurotic conductor go to bed with each other for ever? This film is also about ""putting on a show,"" and in the end the show is just so darn good that everyone cries and hugs each other. I prefer Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. I'm now ready to watch a DVD of Tannhauser--without the bathos."
1,Another BOMB from Taylor Steele!,"Taylor Steele is the most overrated director in the world of surfing. Here's another example of his tired attempt to be 'cool' in the world of surfing. I'm sure he has the right attitude to get along with all of those surfers, but he has no sense of art, story, direction, mood, music AND waves! This was tough to sit through and I returned the DVD immediately! Buyer beware."
1,SanDisk Doesn't Make a 12GB Extreme III,"I made the mistake of purchasing one of these on eBay. The card turned out to be only 8GB which prompted calls to Canon and SanDisk support. It turned out that SanDisk doesn't even make a 12GB card and the serial number was phony also, according to their tech support.Before purchasing one of these, call SanDisk and verify this for yourself at 1-866-SANDISK. Also, check out the eBay article about this issue. Do a web search for ""eBay Guides - FAKE SanDisk Extreme Compact Flash Cards Exposed"". You'll see lots of hits. Remember, fakes don't have any warranty. I hope this saves others from getting ripped off."
2,Not Region Free,"Although the trilogy is marked with an ""ALL REGION"" symbol, only 'Old Boy' work in my Sony ""Multi-Region"" Bluray player.I will have to send the films back."
3,Great movies but...,"I ordered this 6 weeks ago and I still haven't gotten it. They are the only place that has it, otherwise I would have cancelled by now. I love Amazon in every other regard, but this is pretty crappy.The movies are great, though"
2,They REALLY want me to watch Lady Vengeance,"I ordered this box set and was so excited to start watching them. Only problem was rather than getting what is offered in the set, it's missing Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance altogether and instead has a complete duplicate copy of Lady Vengeance. Otherwise I would rate this item more favorably, but I'm sitting at a 2-stars until I get this issue worked out with Amazon.com"
4,Hooray for Vengeance Movies!,"I am so glad I waited for the Vengeance Trilogy to be released. If you like revenge movies, this is the collection for you. These stories not only show violence and destruction, but can also show how revenge can backfire. The best out of all of the three is no doubt Oldboy. Even though I had an idea of how it was going to end, it didn't stop my mouth from gaping. Min-sik Choi is amazing in it. He is also in Lady Vengeance (as a different character). Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Lady Vengeance are good - but Oldboy is definitely the highlight.I don't want to say much more, since I don't particularly like spoiling movies. Let's just say that I am more than happy I have these movies in my collection."
5,Great Psychological Crime Thrillers!,"Got the trilogy on blu from Amazon's merchant, Moviedepot, for $19.99+ $3 ship. Each of these movies run about $20/each when bought separately. All 3 have excellent PQ and AQ on blu. Didn't see any of the problems others have complained about.Sympathy for Mr Vengeance * 3-stars* - a bit ""soft"" and lacking character development. One of the fight scenes involved slapping which took away from the film.Lady Vengeance * 4-stars * - well made and probably the best female revenge movie.Oldboy * 4.5-stars * - clever, twisted, and extremely well made. a classic for sure.Watch all 3 in that order. Then go watch ""I Saw The Devil"" and get blown away!"
5,Good,It was great i will do business with you again cheers mate dogs are good company on the weekends thanks
5,Rapid Fire Study Guide,"Very effective study guide, real measure will be how well I do on the test. Questions are well written. Would definitely recommend."
5,"of course, he's right. The internet will be the government","Basically what Dick Morris and Matt Drudge have both realized, is that as the cost of communication drops to zero, the political and media institutions that have been based on restricted access to information and power, will be drastically re-formed. Not the sham 'campaign reform' which has been the successful creation of an incumbancy entitlement, but rather the true reformation of participatory democracy. There will be excesses and adjustments. The process is in its infancy, but Morris has seen the trend for what it is. Those who don't like Dick Morris should still recognize him for what he is, the most brilliant mind in politics who is willing to speak his mind. (There may be more brilliant individuals, but they don't tell us what they are really thinking.) If you don't read this book, some of these changes may take you by surprise. If you want to help shape the political future, please read this book."
2,Gems buried very deeply,"Morris' ""Vote.com"" is poorly written, poorly edited, and repetitious. If you have the patience to muddle through, however, there are insights to be gleaned. This would have made a good 28-page paper."
3,"Doesn't come with a new ""O"" ring.","I would have rated it 5 but I had to go out and find a new ""O"" ring for the canister side of the filter."
2,Not sure...,"I'm about 100 pages in and I can't decide whether to keep reading or not. I was really expecting to be totally enthralled with this book as a result of the description and the reviews but so far, I can't get connected to the story or the characters. I find the concept of the book fascinating but ultimately, I don't find the characters engaging and in some ways it all seems superficial or contrived to me. At the same time, I keep believing that if I stick it out a little longer, I will find it more compelling and that I might miss out on a good book if I give up. My philosophy has always been that I would rather walk away from a book I'm not enjoying or gaining anything from in favor of others that I would find more satisfying. With this one, I'm very torn. I think I may ultimately move on to something else. That being said, if the description interests you, I would recommend giving it a chance; maybe it will speak to you more than it has to me."
2,Is life really like this?,I persevered the 800- pages of this novel always looking for ultimate goodness of human nature to triumph. It was in vane! The theme of this novel seens to be that the bad eggs in each family are reproduced again and again. How dreary! Would have been a better read if the grammar had been corrected!
4,Haunting,"I purchased this CD for one song only, a song seldom mentioned by other reviewers. Love the movie because it is a shadow in each of us...a dark shadow."
3,"Yep Mullholland Dr, It's the nightmare of character Diane","The first half of the film starts with a close-up of red linnen sheets someone turning underneath....there's the clue. We are not wacthcing reality first but a dream of Diane's.And after the dive to the ""rabbit hole"" i.e the blue box, that's when reality kicks in.So Diane is unhappy with her relationship with Camilla and she sees a dream where both of them are ""victims""of Hollywood glam, hence happy together.Untill ofcourse they enter the vicious world of entertainment the Theatre Silecio,...that's when Diane wakes up and ""let's the cat out"" and boom we're in good old superficial Hollywood where everything is corrupted and rotten."
2,"Well, it's not terrible","It's worth the cut of ""Llorando.""The majority of the soundtrack sounds like the atmospheric, two-fingered ""eery"" music I once tried to compose on a keyboard for a college play. It's not that this is bad music. It's just uninspired."
1,For pre-teen beginner sewers only,This book is simply not suitable for anyone who has already sewn two pieces of fabric together.The designs are ridiculous and impractically small. This book will be appropriate if sewing a strap onto a pocket cut from an old pair of jeans appeals to you. Might be okay for a pre-teen just starting out sewing.
2,not for grown ups,I expected more from the book. It really was for children to play with glue etc. no sew or patterns. big disappointment.
1,"Odd designs, not something I'd make","I'm glad I borrowed the book from the library before buying. Are these bags what ""hip"" people make? I guess I'm not hip. Some of the designs are absurd like the duct tape bag and the newspaper one. Definitely beginner projects."
5,18 roaster magnalite,like the roaster very well return it it was to large only me and my husband if had big family would had kept it
4,Magnalite is great,"I want to rate this a high five. However, the original magnalite makers have sold out and their products are now being made in China (?) and are not near the quality we have seen in past Magnalite products. However, these are still big, sturdy pots that can handle high heat, lots of stirring and clean up beautifully. We love magnalite pots. Even with the lower quality of magnalite, these are still MUCH much better than many of the pots you can buy in stores."
5,MAGNALITE CLASSIC 18-INCH ROASTER,VERY SATISFIED WITH ORDER PROCESS AND ROASTER. ARRIVED QUICKLY AND WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.
1,Not the Usual Magnalite,My first set of cookware was Magnalite and both my Mom and Grandmother owned Magnalite. This aint your usual Magnalite. It arrived warped and scratched up and was shipped in it's own box with no packing materials. It also appeared to be a return because the box had been opened and retaped shut. Not to be anti China but that's where this was maufactured. I will try to buy this made somewhere else because it looks to be a cheap immitation of the real thing.
3,Nice but not the same,I have used this kind of roaster for the holidays over the years and love them. It keeps the Turkey so moist and cooks very even.The problem I have with this new one is it is made in China not the USA like my other one. The new one is not as heavy and the quality of workmanship not up to par. I never found it on the internet as a recalled item so I kept it but still am not really confortable with products made in CHINA because of the lead content in allot of their products.
1,Not the original magnalite,"I returned the product. The product was nothing close to the set of magnalite that I was trying to add to. The material was lighter in weight, the lid did not fit securely and the inside appeared to be unfinished. The texture was very rough. My original set, which is 15 years old still works perfectly and looks great."
2,Damaged or defective,"This item would be great if it would not have been damaged (defective) when I received it. This item was advertised as open box only. There were several that were open box ""scratched."" I stayed away from those because I thought there was a chance that they would have defective lids like some of the other reveiwers mentioned. In addtion, this item was a little more than those. So I was somewhat surprised when I received that item and it had a lid that did not fit on the pot correctly. Being an open box I would have thought the defective lid would have been pretty obvious and mentioned. I am sure that the full price, unopened ones are fine. I have used magnalite for years and they are still great large pots (even though they are made in China now)."
3,Title is a mystery,"After reading this I concluded that the writer knew a lot about Beckett's life but that he didn't know why Beckett wrote the way he did. There's plenty in here about his family life and lifestyle throughout the years. The title is something of a mystery though: Cronin doesn't explain what made Beckett a modernist or why he was the last modernist. He hints at his postwar change from knowingness to unknowingness and his hostility to narrative, but he doesn't link this to the modernism of the title. Why did he write a 100 page paragraph in the unnameable and how did that make him the last modernist? Cronin doesn't say. But you will learn that Beckett liked his whiskey and playing billiards. He was an avid sportsman as a child and followed sport, especially rugby, closely during his life. And for that side of things this book is worth picking up."
3,Painful,"I have just finished wading through this weighty tome. It is shameful that this author who evidently knew Beckett intimately but did not learn any from him. He makes it clear to us, how Beckett was able to develop a concise reductive approach to his work in which he reduces sentences to a mere phrase.This book need editing dramatically. Cronin waffles for pages and pages about the most tangential issues barely relavent to Beckett's life.On occassion, conjecting as what Beckett may be thinking or not. This goes on for two thirds of his book and then he cuts short the most active period of Beckett's life. A moment that Cronin has the most resources availble to him with documents and personnel. Beckett was a master of language this author should read him."
3,THE ATRAIN IS ROLLIN,"I AM A BIG CHICAGO BEARS FAN, SO ONE CAN APPRECIATE THAT WHEN WE DO HAVE A SUPERSTAR IN CHICAGO THAT IT BE DONE AS CRISP AND REALISTIC AS THIS ONE WAS"
1,"Careful, the MP3 download is less than 2 minutes long.",Several sites offer this 1:55 download ... it is 1 minute and 55 seconds long whereas the whole CD album is just over an hour long. Buyer beware.
1,Not sure why others think this was a good purchase...,"It is advertised as an ""album"" when in reality it is a song. It's called false advertising, and buyer definitely beware. Love the ""song"", wish I had the rest of the album."
1,"Yes, please beware","Yes, please notice, this download is ONLY 1 minute and 55 seconds.I didn't realize that.Would like to hear more and then I would rate differently."
1,"In the Age of Wiki, A Book More Worthless Than Ever","I can't find any value in a work like this - in this day and age, one can surf the web for 90 minutes and be far more enlightened than this.Alot of the time I know am in the presence of someone who cannot stand the grandness of Nietzsche's vision - he relays this to the listener in tone and weasel words. The author doesn't like Nietzsche - which for a reader is worse than hating.The rest of the time, one has the author makes it his job to apologize for the Nietzsche's excesses twisted by those who would willfully distort the racial philosophy, etc.To the writer's credit? If you hate Nietzsche, you can use this to make yourself sound smarter in your argument with a Nietzsche-lover. If you haven't read him, you won't want to."
2,No philosophy; plenty of gossip,"Well, Strathern is certainly entertaining, if not informative. He gives us the dirt on each philosopher, tells us who was overweight, cheap, pushed people around, etc. This would be great if we were reading about movie stars or politicians but I bought these books in order to understand something about what these philosophers thought. He does reserve a few pages at the end of each volume to tells us one or two of their ideas and gives us a handful of quotes. A total waste of money unless you hate your philosophy classes so much that you want to hear how awful the personal lives of the philosophers were. A new low in publishing."
1,Doesn't Do Nietzsche Justice,"Nietzsche in 90 minutes? This worthless attempt to present Friedrich Nietzsche's very profound and complex ideas in a concise form as a quick read for the reader utterly fails in every aspect! Paul Strathern only gives a very, very brief outline of Nietzsche's philosophy and a short biography of his life interspersed with numerous disparaging remarks about Nietzsche. One gets the idea that Paul Strathern thinks that Nietzsche was just a megalomaniacal joke who took himself too seriously. He writes off all of his philosophical works as ""childish"" and only understandable to teenagers. Although extremely easy to read, ""Nietzsche in 90 Minutes"" is an extremely depthless, shallow book that does not clarify or shed light on any of Nietzsche's ideas. For anyone that is interested in learning more about Friedrich Nietzsche: DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"
1,This is not a good book,"The author considers himself to be able to explain Nietzsche'sphilosophy in 60 pages. He does not achieve this, and dares towrite things like: ""eternal recurrence is simply poetry, aworthless idea"". I do not recommend this book to anyone whowants to start reading Nietzsche, instead try ""Nietzsche forBegginers"""
2,Strathern's Cute Little Series is Getting Worse,"Strathern's books appeal to two main types of readers: (1) Curious newbies who would like to dip their feet in philosophy and/or science; and (2) Lazy intellectuals who want to learn everything about everything without doing any real work. Either group will be ill-served by this book, which treats important ideas in a smug and cursory manner. The best introduction to Nietzsche is probably ""The Gay Science"", by Nietzsche himself. He's a much more powerful, disturbing, and beautiful writer than Strathern would have you believe."
2,Lacks depth... very simple,More of Nietzsche words should be included into this book. As is we get more of a biographical knowledge than of the actual work itself. More quotes would help and certainly a little more depth into his works as well. In the end it all seems like a MTV clip... too fast and too little. Same for other books in the series.
4,A delightful enhancement for quick references to Nietzsche.,"Paul Strathern combines quick insight of Nietzsche's biography with his memorizing works. By breaking down simply the instances in Nietzsche's life, you are left refreshed and intrigued on most aspects of the exisitential philosopher. Though it is very short and simple, it yields at understandings that not only amuse you but informs as well."
3,Good introduction,"This bite size morsel of a book is a great way to acquaint oneself with the basics of the philosopher's thought. I strongly suggest one read Strather's series of books. They make for an enjoyable read, and leave one feeling invigorated and ready to take on any philosopher."
1,Worst Book of any kind EVER.,"This book gives golf and books a bad name. To play a round of golf with Fred Gefen must be hell... Schindler's List was a funnier book. This book leaves but one burning question... What is the opposite of funny? In fact, this book is also the answer to that question."
4,Wynton's take on Trane,"Okay, it's not John Coltrane, it most definitely sounds like a Wynton Marsalis album. A lot of his trademark style in arranging and playing is evident throughout... perhaps a little too evident. But it's a delightful album nonetheless and loads of fun to listen to. Not as adventurous and interesting perhaps as the original, but still worth a spin. Wynton gets the same fabulous performances out of his group as he always does, and the music... well, what can you say... It's ""A Love Supreme""... the music is supreme!"
1,buyers be warned ! this may not be what you hope for !,"Buyers need to be warned that this is Marsalis' own version of A Love Supreme which he had liberally rewritten and given much big band flavor. Others might disagree, but I think this is a total abomination of one of the finest jazz albums ever created. I heard this mess live at Lincoln Center. I could tell by the audience reaction that they were displeased, no booing but near dead silence. Elvin Jones was in the audience that night, I wanted to ask him if he knew ahead of time what Marsalis had done. I had heard a very fine rendition of A Love Supreme the prior year at Carnegie Hall performed by the now-defunct Carnegie Hall jazz band. They did an amazing job retaining the original characteristics without doing a note-by-note copy."
2,Not a great deal,"Line is great, but be advised this is a small spool of line 110yards. You can get much cheaper at Walmart."
5,Excellent service!!!,"Compact Disc was exactly as advertised, fast delivery! Plays great, takes me back to my Navy days when I had it on tape.Thanks!"
5,Excellent Compilation,"To my mind, the problem with many 'tribute' albums revolves around the selection of particular musicians to perform particular songs. They often do not match well. In this case, the selections were excellent. The result is a wonderful CD that brings out not only the best of Guthrie and Leadbelly but also of the artists covering their songs. Sweet Honey in the Rock open with a warm, evocative rendition of Sylvie. Bob Dylan's Pretty Boy Floyd is as good as Dylan has ever sounded. It is reminiscent in tone and content to his own Hurricane Carter. Little Richard's Rock Island Line was terrific as was U2's Jesus Christ. Springsteen, Taj Mahal, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris and Arlo Guthrie round out the CD with other excellent tracks. It evokes the era in which the songs were written. The CD is well worth buying."
3,different size than my other L shirt,I have a tri-blend shirt also in size L from Tylers in Austin. This shirt is at least 2 inches wider than the Tylers shirt despite both being same brand and same size.I love the color and fabric. But be careful of varying sizes.Go figure.
2,bad advertisement,"The shirt is a great shirt, but it's not the shirt that was advertised in the picture. I saw a picture of a girl wearing it and it looked more like a 3/4 sleeve unisex shirt and it was just the typical unisex tri-blend from American Apparel. I'm just using it as a sleep shirt."
4,Perfect for travel,"I travel A LOT and this makes it hard for when I have a multi-stop trip. I once went from a perfect 80F Athens, Greece to a freezing 12F Beijing, China. With that kind of change I needed a shirt that would be suitable as a base layer or my only top layer and these shirts worked.The material is light and brethable and really soft against the skin (hand wash in cold water and after a few times they get even softer). The fit of the shirt is perfect for me, it's not a slim fit nor is it regualr. It's tight in the right places while loose in the otehrs.These shirts are perfect for warm weather, but I would recomend a different shirt for a base layer in colder weather."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Not only did this drive completely fail after only 4 months but the company refused to honor the guarantee! Also, don't be taken in by the resemblence to the other Crossfire drives (like I was). This is a much heavier and nosier drive.There are many more reliable and cheaper drives on the market. I replaced this unit with a LaCie, which is not only much quieter but also seems faster.I lost over 150 MB of music files when this drive failed for no apparent reason. The company refused to accept Amazon order form as proof of purchase and refused to honor their guarantee.A word of advice, for those planning large music projects. You should be prepared to buy at least 2 large drives in order to be able to backup. Also avoid this company and research your options!"
5,It's not about us! It's about God!,"In the book ""From Mourning to Morning"", Harry and Cheryl Salem share with us the heart wrenching story of the home going of their daughter, Gabrielle. The faith, hope, and strength that the Salems' hold onto through their journey with Gabrielle is unbelievable...and only attainable through their love for Jesus.As I read this book, which was nearly impossible to put down, I had a renewed sense of hope and a definite increase in faith. Very inspirational."
1,Not Realistic,"This book is not the least bit realistic. What are the odds three 10 year old girls could tame a wild pony in only a few a weeks with no help? And how could a formerly tame,docile pony go completely wild in just under a year? When I bought my horse he had been out to pasture for two years,but he was pretty well behaved when he came to my stable. Plus,despite their relatively small size,Morgan horses are usually considered horses. If you have a horse-crazy child who dreams of ponies,(but the closest theyv'e been to one is the pony ride Shetlands at the county fair)then this is the book for them. But if your'e really into horses and know your'e fair share of horse knowledge,steer clear of this 100% FAKE horse story."
5,This book is good . I suggest you read it.,"Try this book you will like it. I find it great. The Pony Pal books are the best kid's horse fiction books there are. They go 1-16 (coming soon # 17 Detetctive Pony).It also includes Super specials # 1,2, and 3.It is about three girls(Pam,Anna and Lulu ) who find a pony in some- one's backyard . The owner of the pony is careless enough to leave it for slaughter.Will the Pony Pals save the day? Read to find out!"
4,almost,"the transcriptions are very accurate, however, crucial string arrangements are left out of the songs. for example, the strings section in the song 'needs,' though not that hard to figure out given the tonalities, are not tabbed out like they were in the tablature book for collective soul's self-titled album. aside from this lack, though, this is a good place to start for the beginning to intermediate guitarist since the songs here require many basic rock techniques that are easily built upon and will certainly show up in one's later rock repetoire."

1,Not good looking,"I bought it for 52$, when I received it, I was disappointed... It's not worth for 52$.Very old fashioned and not at all attractive... Pictures shown here are deceptive."
1,American Pie,"I have always been a fan of APie so I was thrilled to hear a remake was happening with Madonna. When I heard the song, however, I was very disappointed. The singing was fantastic but the music totally destroyed what American Pie is all about. I am not a musician so I can't give you specifics but it just sounds like the music doesn't match the lyrics. It is like a marching band at a dance. I sure wish you would have done this differently, Madonna. You're one of the best artists I've ever heard and I love your music."
4,fun fun fun,"This CD stands out in my collection like a sore thumb. It's not jazz, it's not blues, it's not an improvisational statement. None of the players will ever make the Rock & Roll hall of fame. It's simply a great rock record. It's fun, it's dopey, and it's loud. Just the way a dopey rock record should be"
4,Baby I've been (...) already,"This is where is all started (discounting A Catholic Education). One of the great underrated bands of the last decade showed just what they were capable of in the messy, poignant, joyous collection of songs that is Bandwagonesque. Big Star blah blah - Teenage Fanclub stand on their own as a great band who write great songs, full stop. And they invented Travis.December, Guiding Star, What You Do to Me and Alcoholiday are all lovely, but my favourite is the Gerry Love penned instrumental Is This Music, though how the Fannies managed to get their guitars to sound like bagpipes is a mystery not uncommon in Scottish bands (remember Big Country?).Bandwagonesque is not as smooth as later Teenage Fanclub offerings, the wonderful Grand Prix, the excellent Songs From Northern Britain and their latest long player Howdy, but in its sheer ragged exuberance it stands out as one of the best albums of the 90s."
4,Memories of all kinds,"This album reminds me of a great alternative rock radio station in Minnesota circa 1991. Just at the time I thought ""rock"" was dead, along came that radio station and albums like this. ""The Concept,"" ""What You Do To Me,"" and ""Star Sign"" received regular rotation on the old KJJO, and what great tunes they were. Over the course of time this album has become a favorite in my collection. Good times. Great tunes. If it weren't for my discovery of classic alternative bands like this I'd probably be listening to country-and-western now. Ugh. :)"
3,Not great...,"I don't understand why many people say this is Teenage Fanclub's best album. It's actually quite boring - but then many people would say that TF ARE boring! There are only a couple good tracks on this record, and personally I prefer Songs From Northern Britain. Different strokes..."
2,Glo light went out right-a-way,"I bought this watch and the glo light stopped working only days after the manufacturers warranty expired. It keeps decent time, but i needed to have a watch with a night light, so I am very unhappy this product broke while it was so new. Probably should find another brand."
5,is nice watch,"the watch is very good, is casual, I like the brightness of the light at night, you can see very well, and the aesthetics of it is elegant"
4,Russia's painful transition away form communism,"Pavel Lounguine's ""Taxi Blues"" personifies the painful transition of Russia from communism to whatever it is they have ended up having over there in two men who have one of those chance meetings that changes one of them forever. Pyotr Zajchenko as Shchlikov represents the old Russia: he is hard working, rather dour and brutish, and misses communism. While driving his taxi cab one night he meets Liocha (Pyotr Mamonov), symbolizing the new Russia: he is at least irresponsible if not insane, an alcoholic, and a musician obviously influence by the decadent West. Their ""friendship"" forces Shchlikov to reassess his entire life. Even if you do not read ""Taxi Blues"" as an allegory, it is a compelling tale of a man forced to face brutal truths. Certainly a depressing film, but the emotions are justified because nobody every promised life would be fair."
5,"the Residential ""Tommy!""","this is one of my favorite Residential treats! Their collective talent explodes in this one!Fashioned in the style of a rock opera, God in 3 Persons explores the polar opposites of Pain and Pleasure. Metaphoricly and sexually. ""Pain and Pleasure are the twins...""Join the Residents as they tell the tale of ""Mr.X"" and his two newfound friends- siamese twins joined together at the shoulder. Share his experience as their friendship becomes carnal and how the whole atmosphere of the relationship changes after that.This album is adult, with adult themes. It explores with metaphores, the world of B&D; and S&M.;""For everything that gives us pleasure also gives us pain to measure it by... and all our lives we love illusion, neatly cought between confusion.. and the need to know that we are alive.""""- The Residents"
5,Simply beautiful.,"Rosana is one of the best-sellers singers in Spain, she has the power to decide to record an album every 3 years. Her selling status helps her very much with this kind of decision.She only has 3 albums and this one is the happiest one. Her letters are painful but beautiful. But ""Rosana"" has a little bit of everything, good lyrics, more flamenco rhythms mixed with that big talent that this woman has.Her music can be compared with Alejandro Sanz but she's much better.This album includes the hit singles: ""Pa'ti no estoy"" (I'm not here for you), ""Gira"" (Spin) and ""Hoy"" (Today)."
5,Outstanding!,"This is my first CD by ROSANA. I'm very impressed! Oftentimes, singers try to mimic other successful singers. In this CD, I find ROSANA has a very good and unique singing voice and style that I can't compare to anyone else. Each track is unique and the overall arrangements are very good. I especially like the track ""Donde Ya No Te Tengo"" since it has a jazzy / blues feeling.The only track that I really don't like is ""Mil Y Una Noche"" because I'm not a big fan of mariachi. I didn't deduct for it because it is the ""bonus"" track. I guess that's what I really like about this CD. It goes from a jazzy / blue track to a pop track to a mariachi track. Lucky for me, there's only one mariachi track which I can avoid."
3,"Not the best so far, but not bad","I always await the release of the new Destroyer books, and the title alone was enough to expect another satire-filled romp. Not so. The humor was pretty low-brow, and the characters shallow. Not at all the usual quality of the Destroyer books. The review at sinanju.com was true"
4,Excellent escape book,"Will Murry has taken the reins of the series, when the original author went to Hollwood to be in films, and has taken the books to new entertainment highs. This ""can't put it down"" book is funny and exciting and make you glad you read it when you are done.It is a the best investment of five dollar you can make"
2,People are getting tired of white bad guys.,"People are getting tired of white bad guys. Full 90% of inter-racial crime is black on white (U.S. Crime Statistics). 99% of books are about White bad guys, blacks as victims. It is very boring"
2,author burned-out?,A ho-hum Remo entry. One of the other reviewers here said the author went to Hollywood or something. Looks like he dictated this entry over the phone. Boring.
5,Magnificent,"My first impression of Karita Mattila and her voice was ""breathtaking!"" What a magnificent voice, expressive and true, and filled with a rich vibrato and a memorable tone. I've been recommending this CD to everyone I know who is into opera!"
5,Like water for chocolate,"""Ahhhhhh..."" is my one-word review for this CD. Karita Mattila satisfies. I simply have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about when they mention flaws. There aren't any. And if you insist on there being one, it would be that there weren't included MORE songs on this recital album. Lately I have been listening to Troyanos' version of When I Am Laid by Purcell, and I would love to hear Karita sing it. I would love to see Karita's live performance. I would marry Karita. I love her. And I didn't know a thing about her before I accidently acquired this CD."
5,A brillient music album by a band known for writing pop,"Teenage Fanclub's musical ablity and emotion is showed at its best on this album. The album is nothing short of amazing. It's not quite pop though, so if you are expecting another album of similar style to their others you might be surprised. It's a far less happy and far more difficult album. The lyrics are simple but they become better with each listen.Despite the fact it is called Thirteen and may feel teenage at first, it is the most grown up music the group has written. It goes far beyond pop and is quite an interesting listen. I would prefer this album to many newer bands like Coldplay, Jet, The White Stripes, The Strokes, etc. because the quality of the music is not even comparable. Teenage Fanclub deserves a place in music history well before any of these bands. Buy the album and enjoy it."
4,"First half is best, then looses steam","The first 6 tracks are quite good but then the album gets a bit tiresome. Worth it, though for ""Hang On"", ""Cabbage"", ""Song To The Cynic"", ""Norman 3 (I'm In Love With You)"", and ""Radio"" especially. The Big Star influence is strong again. Sometimes you swear it's Alex Chilton singing. The band really knows how to channel the man and the band in their music."
4,Like a misunderstood child.,"It's a pity this album has gotten such a bad rap as many of the songs have more lasting power that the often repetitive Bandwagonesque. While the album as a whole doesn't quite measure up to the sheer brilliance of Grand Prix, songs like the heart on your sleeve rocker The Cabbage can't be denied."
2,oops,"Definately the worst Fanclub Album. The first few tracks are cool,but most of it is just boring, badly mixed drivel. ""Hang on"", ""The Cabbage"" and ""Radio"" are about all that's worth listening to. Any other album is worlds better. Even ""The King""."
4,Another Excellent Record,TFC is wonderfully consistent. And Thirteen is just as good as any of their other albums. But I'll admit that it wasn't until after ignoring it for a year or so and coming back to it that I realized how good it was. Not that I didn't like it from jump because I did. But I like it even more now than I did before. It's pretty long for a rock album and there's alot here to discover. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed.
3,"Unlucky for some, not a classic","First I'll mention the standouts. Radio, aptly the album's one hit single in the UK, is a great fast pop track which shows their makeshift roots as well as their pop edge. Fear Of Flying is a dramatically underrated lament, with a lovely ""Hey hey hey!"". Opener Hang On is a 6 minute epic evolving from a T-Rex style solo to a lush string finale. 120 Minuters merits a mention for its subtle anti-fame lyrics and clever tune. But overall I agree with some of the negative feelings people have over it. It's too sprawling, too bland and has some real stinkers, esepcially Norman 3 which seems like a band in-joke accidentally committed to record."
3,Half-Baked and Lukewarm,"Well, I don't worship ""Bandwagonesque"" only. I love Grand Prix and Songs From Northern Britain also.There are only two Teenage Fanclub albums that I don't care for: A Catholic Education, and Thirteen. Even after many listens, I have to come to the conclusion that Thirteen is definitely inferior to their other great albums. I am glad that they really rebounded back with Grand Prix, after making this semi-flop."
2,A misstep,"This is the album that made me think that Bandwagonesque must have been a fluke; that the Fanclub had only one good album in them, and then they were spent.I'm really glad I was wrong about that, since they redeemed themselves fully with Grand Prix and Songs from Northern Britain. But Thirteen still just sits gathering dust in my CD rack. It has nothing really worth listening to on it, except maybe ""Radio."" But even that one is subpar compared to a lot of their other stuff. Unless you absolutely have to complete your collection, give this one a pass, but definitely pick up their other albums."
2,"The Fanclub's only ""flop"" album","There is a reason this album is marked down to about six dollars. It is a flop, both commercially and creatively.If you are new to Teenage Fanclub, buy Bandwagonesque. Thirteen was a huge disappointment for me after that awesome album. Thankfully, though, they did redeem themselves after Thirteen, with the great Grand Prix album."

4,Could have been a contender.,"One small correction. ""Trapper John M.D. was not a sequel to the show-It was a sequel to the Robert Altman movie. MASH the t.v show was an acquired taste, though it was a dark comedy people remember the comical moments. AfterMash was kind of dark, it took place in a depressing place(A VA hospital) and the Hawkeye type doctor with the prosthetic leg was a little hard to get used too. I rememeber that there were problems with the timeslot , but had it been given enough time it would have worked itself out. They were well written characters they just needed more time to develop outside of Korea."
3,If Paramount owns it...,"If Paramount owns it, everyone should stop panting... yes, I would be interested too... witness my appearance searching this site... but look what stingy creeps they are about controlling Star Trek for maximum $, refusing to allow fans to make respectful non-monetary tributes... and changing their own version till it is hardly recognizable. As noted by one reviewer, that's what they did to season 2 of AfterMASH... Yes, how would it hurt them to release it... but will they?"
2,Its Over - Let Go Already,"M*A*S*H was already detiorating when it finally left the air after 11 seasons. One reviewer at the time aptly described the show as becoming ""homogenized"" as the characters became more like the actors that portrayed them.Part of the appeal of the original series was the fact that these people were thrown into a setting where they couldn't leave. They lived and worked in a war zone far away from home and had to learn to get along. ""After MASH"" was set in a stateside hospital. The characters we had become familiar with could now go home to their families and leave the work day behind them.That was just uninteresting to me. And besides, some characters are better talked about than actually seen (Mrs. Potter). I was a fan of all the actors involved, but I was glad to see the show get an early cancellation."
2,Not As Advertised,"You describe this as .750"" thick it is in fact .075"" thick. Big difference. Review decimal fractions. Other than that this stuff goes on easily but I can't tell that it stopped much sound in my car."

3,Peterson's Engineer and Computer Science Careers,"This book gives people interested in Computer Science and Engineering a relatively comprehensive look at the various career options available to them. It discusses the educational requirements necessary for various positions, the starting salary of the positions and a short description of the work that would be performed. The only thing I found lacking in this book was the amount of information given regarding the specific job. I would have preferred more detail when describing the actual tasks of each position. Otherwise, I found the book quite helpful and I feel it painted a realistic portrait of most entry level positions available for engineers and computer science majors."
2,Dreck,"Others have said it - we all like Phil's voice, we all like what Vinnie can do (on his own albums), Pete and Jason are solid, but the songs ROT. Vinnie's sound here just isn't UFO. I've listened to it 3 times now hoping it'd get better, but it's headed to the CD dust heap, never to be retrieved. Luckily, the day I picked this up I also bought the Schenker Pattison CD, which I've listened to every night for a week. It's probably the best whole ALBUM Michael has done in almost 20 years - its different, not really my genre, but man is he good! So if you just gotta buy the UFO album, get the Schenker Pattison too so you won't hateth yourself cometh the morn!"
3,"Music: A, Lyrics: C+","I have to agree with the other review, the guitars, drums, etc. are excellent. Vinnie Moore does a nice job. As for the lyrics, not that great. It might be because Phil Mogg has cranked out quite a few albums in the last 5-6 years under different band formations. He should refine his material a little more before laying it down. Don't worry, us die-hards will be here to buy the next record."
4,Better than the reviews,This whol cd is good to very good. I like all the songs on it..don't have to skip around on it. Vinnie Moore is a excellent replacement for Schenker. It's one fault is the sometime weak lyrics like Jello Man...it might have been better called ghetto man with appropriate lyrics to go with that title. I like it better and better each time and I like better than last two cd's. It's not Lights Out but it's good.
3,not bad not great,"I really was excited to check this out , being a lover of UFO since back in the day .And I dig Vinnie Moore as well, so I figured this can't miss . But it does miss ,its not because the players arent great , they just arent great together . Of course I knew it would sound different than UFO with Michael Schenker , but to me there's something missing ,the chemistry just don't sound right. Like I said Phil is a great singer , Vinnie is a monster guitar player but together as UFO .Im sorry I was like eh , its not a bad album , but its not UFO ."
2,Mostly disappointed,I have been a fan of UFO for about 17 years. Great individual players does not a great CD make. And this CD is rather boring. The best song is the first. The music isn't memorable enough and the lyrics are sadly lacking this time around. Just telling it like it is. Let others indulge in hero worship. Let's hope for better next time around.
5,Very under appreciated cd,"You know, I really must be bored tonight, because I have read every review of this cd. I bought this cd about a week ago and I really enjoy it. I have been listening to UFO since the late 70's ( I am 42). I used to think Michael Schenker was a God, and I still think he is ONE INCREDIBLE guitar player! I still think he rocks, to be quite honest (and I know he has been through quite a bit lately, personally), but that aside, Vinnie Moore really put his stamp on this cd. He realized who he was going to be compared to and did a GREAT JOB of channeling MS and made a great piece of work. I really don't understand the bad reviews. I know it is just a matter of opinion. Listen to this cd a few times. It really rocks!! I saw Vinnie Moore in a night club one time and, believe me, he held back big time for the SPIRIT of UFO on this cd. Great job guys. I really think this is one of my favorite cd's this year ( I know it was released about two years ago)."
2,More of the same,"This CD has exactly the same atmosphere, production values and general effect that all the previous UFO since their comeback with Schenker, be it WALN ON WATER, COVENANT and SHARKS. It's like it it's the same album with another nam, up to a point that Vinnie Moore plays exactly like Schenker in the mentioned phase of the band. It's incredible! (well, better try to play like the master than goes shredding the whole album!)The twelve tracks drags on and on without ending. Of course there are good moments, theses guys are very talented musicians. Jason Bonham drumming is very solid and interesting, a real upgrade to the band (altough Ansley Dunbar delivered the goods also).Anyway, is a good album for a completist."
2,"as hard as i to like this, i just can't","i bought this cd because i am a fan of vinnie moore, and because i like some of the classic UFO stuff. i'm sure die-hard UFO fans will probably like it, but as a fan of vinnie moore, i can't recommend buying this cd. if you have any of vinnie's previous solo stuff, you have no need to buy this. most of it is recycled material. maybe my expectations were too high. some of the lyrics are great, and some of them areextremely cheesy. the whole thing is pretty cheesy..."
2,Lazy man lazy!,"I am longtime fan of UFO and Vinne Moore ,but my only gripe on this CD is that ,couldnt Vinnie come up with some NEW Material and not take his riffs from his solo albums?! Lazy ,uninspired and lame ,it makes the vocals n music seem like afterthoughts,and quite forgettable,maybe nexttime guys.2 1/2 stars"
2,Vinnie Moore no more,"Vinnie Moore doesn't play in the same league as Jeff Kollman and probably never will. Vinnie is all technique ( eventhough he doesn't impress one second here ) and no soul or feel. Jason Bonham's bass drums sound too much like Metallica and don't honour his father's and Andy Parker's sound . This problem can be solved easily but I'm not so sure about Vinnie's...It's Phil Mogg who really makes the album worth listening to. I don't care whether Phil will be making his next album under the name UFO or Mogg/ Way or Sign of Four, but I hope it will be with Jeff Kollman !"
3,Not Bad,"Vinnie Moore is a great guitarist! UFO was a great band with Michael Schenker! This CD is good but is flavored with cloned instrumental pieces from Moores own albums. Phil Mogg is not the singer he used to be. He can be very redundant and boring at times. For the next album, I hope the band gets serious with the song writing. And also, it wouldn't hurt to recruit another singer to help poor old Phil out and put some excitment in the vocals."
2,"""NOT YOUR CLASSIC UFO""","A great line-up but the songs fall short! I'm a huge UFO fan but their latest releases keep getting weaker and weaker. Even the cover seems uninspired. If this line-up manages to stay together, they might be able to put together something better in the future. I love UFO but the song writing is lacking this time around. Maybe next time they'll get it right."
5,"Excellent Reproduction, Excellent Classic Team Stories","I never grew up durring the Golden Age. And you don't need to be to enjoy this book. This book reprints All-Star JSA issues #3 - 6. The book features the VERY first Super Hero Team! The stories are corney, sure, but it's still fun and entertaining to this day. Like one reviewer said, if you get one Archive you'll want to get them all - it's that good! Comic fans will love this book, and it's other volumes.This story features interesting characters, like Spectre, Dr. Fate, Golden Age Flash and Green Lantern, Hour Man, The Atom, Hawkman (also features Hawk girl in one issue) and my favorites Sandman and Jonny Thunder!!! All are classic heros that even appear today, like in Comics such as ""Spectre"" (Who is Hal Jordon now) and ""JSA"" written by Awsome Writer Goeff Johns.Buy this book if your a comic fan! Even if you aren't into comics, it's a great place to start and learn. (May as well Start at the begining of Comic Histroy)"
5,"True, Accurate and Easy to Read","The REB is not new, but new to me. I really love this version. It is as easy a read and understand as any contemporary writing, plus it is as true and accurate an English version as one can find.Compared to the many ""contemporary"" or modern English versions this one is miles ahead in its scholarship and accuracy. You can rely on this one.Compared to the other ""serious"" bible versions, the REB does not have the specific agenda (some say bias) of the New International Version (NIV). Plus I find it is an easier read than the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV); which I also find very good.The REB seems to combine the best of both."
1,Learning Curve is a bad company!,"Think twice before you purchase anything from Learning Curve. They no longer have any Customer Service even there is still a toll-free number.

1,Louis Armstrong The Hot Fives,"This disc contains analog material recorded in the '20s and digitally remastered onto CD format. The sound on the disc is akin, nonetheless, to listening to an old RCA Victrola - it is atrocious, unlistenable. I am amazed at the positive customer reviews that led me astray. This will not stop me from buying other Armstrong discs, but ""The Hot Fives"" remastered by Columbia Jazz Masterpieces was put in the used CD bin the day I received it. I strongly recommend trying other discs unless sound quality is of no importance."
3,An overall okay CD.,"Although I loved the movie, 90% of the people i've talked to who saw it hated it, but that doesn't change my mind about it in any way. The soundtrack didn't have this one song i'm looking for, which had the song that was playing through when he bought the car and was driving down the freeway, does anyone know the name of that song?"
4,Not bad,"Although I do not like Paul Walker nor Leelee Sobieski, I did like this movie. I thought it was scary at the right parts and any movie with Steve Zahn - I will watch. He's awesome.Anyway,I have a question about the soundtrack.. could anyone tell me the name of the song that plays when Venna and Fuller are drinking in the motel at night? (it's the part when Fuller comes to Venna's room) It's driving me nuts, thanks to anyone who can help."
3,Whats That Song?,"I want to know the name of the song in the movie, I think its when theyre pulling into a gas station, maybe leaving, but the lyrics go ""Ride on, ride on...."", and I can't seem to find the song anywhere. Can anyone help?"
3,Ride On Song Name,"Decent moody soundtrack, very good movie. The missing ""Ride On"" song is definitely ""You're Mine"" by Sinomatic, not ""Weightless"" by the Old 97's. Both are available via MusicMatch."
2,"Richard Grudens, Glenn Miller: Chattanooga Choo Choo","With all the good, detailed studies of Glenn Miller and his orchestra currently available, there exists no good reason to pick up this shallow glimpse of the man and his band."
5,A breath of fresh air !!!!!!,"The story is pretty darn good. It does deal with some crazy stuff, so don't buy this for people who don't like crazy stuff. I am chomping at the bit for the second one to get here to America. Hopefully, nobody screwed anything up and I can continue to purchase the entire series here in the US, dubbed by my favorite peeps, region 1, and have it done before the year ends. I will wait patiently as long as I can, then it's time to sport the old wooden leg, eye patch, and talking parrot! My money is here waiting, stop messing around and come and get it."
3,Short fast-paced story. I couldnt quite get interested.,"Well judging from the ending, I'm assuming there is going to be a 2nd episode. To be honest, I probably will pass on it. I couldnt really get into this show. Maybe 60 minutes was just too short of a time. Seems like they tried to cram too much story in that short time frame. I will say though, a lot of the animation looked beautiful. I prefer a more drawn out story, not quite so fast-paced, and with more plot/character development. If you want a quick, fast-paced story, this might be your thing."
4,Crazy as they come,"Well this is definitely Sci-Fi all the way, and they story line goes indef so if your not looking for that time of setting at the moment don't do it - but this is definitely a lead on to something more, kinda makes you sad at the end"
3,"fantastic so far... be aware, the 125 minute running time cited here is wrong.","I'm not going to get into the specifics of the movie, though I really enjoyed it and am fairly bummed it will be a year before we see part two and another year to get to part three. That said, I often look to the running time of anime to see if it is feature length. The time cited here on amazon (that amazon refused to alter despite the proof I presented), as well as the time cited on the box of 125 minutes is no accurate. There are two edits of the same movie. The director's cut clocking in at 1 hour 9 minutes (69 minutes). The theatrical cut clocks in at 1 hour 5 minutes (65 minutes). NOT the 125 advertised. It feels disingenuous of them to add those two running times together and somehow arrive at 125 minutes (poor math skills, I suppose). So, you know, be aware. This is not a full length movie. Only about an hour. It's a GREAT hour, don't get me wrong."
2,"It could have been a good story, but wasn't","A teenage prostitute is murdered, but is afterwards brought back to life so that she can testify at her murderer's trial. She has issues. An important issue is does she want justice or vengence?This is a situation that the Japanese can do exceptionally well and I was expecting a really good story. Unfortunately, it dissolved into a torrent of pseudomecha fantasy combat and that was the end of the story.Mardock Scramble does have a great deal of sex and nudity, but I didn't find that objectionable because much of it fit what should have been the core of the story. It's a hard story about a girl who at the beginning of the story sees herself as a hard and messed up person.Mardock Scramble didn't appeal to me, but it might appeal to others. It would be a good idea to watch an episode online beforre deciding whether or not to buy it."
1,A let down,Didn't think much of it. It started off slow and had potential and then went off in a complete direction at the end.
1,Not what I had expected,"I was very disappointed in this aftershave. I love the smell of sandalwood, as I have The Art Of Shaving sandalwood shaving cream, which is amazing. I was hoping for something with a similar scent to complement the shaving cream, but it was not the case. This smelled like the perfume my grandmother had in 50 year-old Avon bottles shaped like airplanes and animals. Unless I received an out-of-date or a bad batch, I cannot see how this can smell good to anybody. It has a musty, moldy smell, which stays with you all day. If you want a good Sandalwood aftershave, try the Art Of Shaving sandalwood aftershave lotion. It smells exactly as it is supposed to, without the mold stench."
4,Wonderful but more a cologne than aftersahve,"My husband loves this ""aftershave lotion"" and so do I. The name is misleading though. It is really a fluid cologne, not a an aftershave lotion as the description says. Using it as an aftershave would be overpowering! The scent is wonderful."
2,Does not smell like the shaving cream it is designed after...,"I absolutely love Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream, so I was excited when my wife and daughter got me a bottle of the aftershave for Christmas last year. Then I put it on and realized it smells absolutely nothing like the shaving soap. Does it work at an aftershave? Yes, it has alcohol or some other astringent product that will give you the appropriate sting when you finish your shave, and it has a perfumey and (just barely) sandalwood scent to it... but DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you are trying to replicate the scent of TOBS Sandalwood Shaving cream."
1,Not a Case of 5!,"I just received this shipment. I am the Scoutmaster for a local Boy Scout troop and I wanted these for a highway trash pickup. The order took weeks to arrive - and when it did, the ""Case of 5"" was actually only a single nabber. While the quality of the one unit seemed okay, I don't think it is worth the pricetag I was expecting for five."
3,A MEDIOCRE COMEDY-DRAMA.,"Dashing Ray Milland and Robert Cummings play reporters from rival newspapers who meet on a train while travelling to a remote Swiss village. The two men are forced to room together due to lack of accomadations at the Hotel, and they are both smitten by Louise Norden (Sonja Henie). But the true identity of Louise's father changes matters considerably...A frothy little number which should please those who like Ray Milland or Sonja Henie. The backgrounds for the film were shot in Sun Valley, Idaho and Fox borrowed Milland from Paramount for this picture, the original working title of which was DOCTOR & there was elements of the story which were based upon the exploits of a real-life doctor."
4,Worth watching soley for the sheer charm of Ray Milland.,"This film is a mixed bag, full of humour, romance, and suspense. It works most of the time, however the scenes where the graceful Sonja skates tends to slow down the film. The piece on it's own is a wonderful display of ice dancing. Anyway, the best scenes involve Ray Milland. They don't make Ray's anymore! He really lights up any bit he's in. Standard story of two men after the same girl and scoop story. Well, one gets the girl, and one gets the memoirs in this bright, fun film."
5,Gorgeous!,"Although I'm not much of a fan of kidney or squid floral arrangements, the sheer beauty and creativity of this book gets one's own creative juices flowing. The specific tips are very helpful, and the results tremendous. Beginners may want this book to save for when they have gained precise knife skills, as the instructions are a bit cryptic. However, they may want to purchase it to save for when they are ready to tackle the incredible possibilities contained within. Professionals will be inspired by the photos. Beautiful work!I did feel, however, that the section in the front of the book (all the dinners) was just a tease, and could be confusing to some with the way the garnishes were referred by page number for instructions. That space could have been used to present more garnishes!"
5,Chinese Appetizers & Garnishes - English & Chines,"I have two of this book, one for me as I want to study how to do decorative garnishing. the other one I bought for the mother of my daughter-in-law for her birthday this year. I am sure she will enjoy this book as much as I had enjoyed mine."
2,Not the best book,"There are much better books to get on this subject, but this was assigned for a class.I wouldn't have chosen this book for reading on my own about Asian Cuisine."
1,Too Many Errors,I found the errors to be very distracting - they changed a good read to a fair read (at best). I find this book to be worthless as a reference document due to the errors.
3,Less Than Expected,"Since I have a budding interest in existentialism, I thought this would be a fascinating read. Perhaps for some it is, but much of the symbolism escaped me, and if you aren't able to make the deeper connections, then you may find this little book boring. At least it's brief though. I'm giving the book 3 stars instead of 2 only because I know it's a classic and that those who 'get it' like it."
3,Lots of information but - yawn - hard work to get to it.,Turgid. There is no question this book is based on genuine and scholarly research. But the ordinary but informed reader is better leaving this one to the academicians.
2,Bad book!,"According to Claude Lanzmann there are several major errors which do occur in Bairs book, and basically it's gives a rotten and unworthy presentation of de Beauvoirs life and work./Leah Greber"
5,Disco perfecto con todos los exitos hasta el 2001,Me encanto! Un disco que nunca cansa y que tiene bastantes canciones para bailar y cantar. Aunque es un disco ideal no dejen de comprar los otros discos del grupo que algunas canciones bastantes buenas no llegaron a ser parte de este disco. Pero todavia el disco es una colleción de canciones que son irrestibles.
2,Pretty but small,"Beautiful watch, but it's to small for a man. It would be a great one if it were bigger. That's why a rated with 2 stars."
3,It's okay,It is a lot smaller then I thought it was and it wasn't quite what I was looking for but it is still a nice watch.
2,No better than cheap ebay adapters,"I purchased this because the cheap $10 adapter I bought off ebay focused a bit PAST INFINITY, meaning if you want to achieve infinity focus in your image, you actually need to set the focus on the lens a little SHORT of infinity. Turns out this adapter has the same problem. It also has an almost identical build quality to the cheap ebay adapters. Additionally, it's a bit misleading to advertise this as an Adorama branded adapter when it's actually a Fotodiox adapter. Had I known this from the start I would not have purchased it, as I was already aware that Fotodiox adapters focus a bit past infinity.Bottom line is, a cheap $10 ebay adapter provides equal performance for a fraction of the price."
2,Strictly an FBI version,"I got the distinct feeling when reading this book that it was written to ""clear"" the Bureau of Investigation agents from wrongdoing. It is a very interesting book, but the author never questions the FBI's files. Only one eyewitness of all the people present at Union Station placed Charley Floyd and Dave Richetti as being present at the ""Kansas City massacre"". Charley Floyd was a bank robber, not a hired gun. Also, the Federal Attorney refused to prosecute Dave Richetti because of lack of evidence. Richetti was then tried by the state, convicted on perjured testimony, and executed. If you really want to find out at least part of the truth, I recommend ""The Union Station Massacred"" by Professor Robert Unger. I have to give this author credit, though. He is talented."
3,The Kid's death in detail,"John W. Poe was a respected lawman who was Pat Garret's deputy with Kip McKinney when the Kid was shot in Pete Maxwell's bedroom, July 1881. This is a detailed description leading up to the event, the shooting and the aftermath, which Poe describes as ""pre-ordained"".The details pretty much follow those of Garret's, but more's the pity that Maxwell and McKinney did not also write their version since both written descriptions have become questionable, if not controversal.This book is a must to add to Billy the Kid collections."
5,Slightly different than the first two!,"Each of Goldsmith's soundtracks to the films in ""The Omen"" trilogy was uniquely constructed to reflect the on-screen horrors that it accompanied. The first was a masterpiece that turned religious scores upside down, deservedly winning Goldsmith his only Oscar.The score to ""Damien: Omen II"" took the first to its next phase by assaulting the senses full throttle with the driving demonic chorus from the first but at an accelerated and more frenzied pace.Finally, the third score hints at the past two but is more traditional in its approach, signifying the story line's defeat of the Anti-Christ.This deluxe version, like the ones for the preceding films, offers cuts not found on the original LP release.And, in light of this year's death of the great Goldsmith, it is fitting testament to his place as one of the cinema's most prolific and gifted composers."
1,suprising content,"Cura is wonderful but the style on this recording was not at all to my taste, my husband's taste or to a hispanic family's taste who know more about the ""bolero"" style than we do. Unfortunately, we all hated it. It is a sort of a slow, slighly jazzy drawl of music that never grabbed any of us."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! I'M WARNING YOU!!,"A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY......I HESITATED ON BUYING THIS CD AND NOW I WISH I HADN'T. JOSE CURA IS KNOWN FOR HIS BIG, ROBUST VOICE IN THE OPERA WORLD..AND I LOVE IT!!! HOWEVER, ON HIS NEW RECORDING OF SO CALLED BOLEROS HE OCCASIONLY SINGS A TOUCH LOUDER THAN HIS NORMAL SPEAKING VOICE. IF YOU WANT SONGS OF LOVE AND INSPIRATION FROM A REAL TENOR, TRY JOSE CARRERAS' AROUND THE WORLD. I BLEW MY CASH ON CURA'S ANHELO AND NOW THIS GARBAGE. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT I WILL NEVER EVER BUY A CURA DISC AGAIN. SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT THE SO CALLED TENOR WANNA-BE'S IN WATSON, BOCELLI, AND AMANTE. THEIR DISCS OFFER EXCITING SINGING AND FEELING..EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT TRUE TENORS. ONE STAR ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT GO LOWER!!"
1,Not for me.,"In bolero singing enunciation is very important. I find that many times he skips through the middle part of a phrase as if the only important part is the end. His pronunciation is also irritating to me. His t's are at times Italian and at times Spanish. Italian t's sound great in Italian, but not in Spanish. I'm not quite sure why he uses both. It is probably his knowledge of many languages. He does sound very nice, though not my cup of tea."
3,"Maria, you gotta see her! or at least hear her.","You Gotta Sin To Get Saved is a good album from former Lone Justice leader Maria McKee. She's a ""real"" musician and songwriter, not a record company product. She could sing the phone book and I'd listen to that voice. I like this solo release about a smuch as the first LJ album but not as much as Shelter. I'm not sure where this release falls in her solo career, if it was her 2nd, 3rd, 4th solo album...It's good music. If you like talented female musicians on the mellow side, this is a good CD. Sort of in the style of 10,000 Maniacs but better than Natalie Merchant.Standout track: I'm Gonna Soothe You"
5,This CD is great!,I have recently come to appreciate jazz and this CD is a pleasure to listen to. I found it very relaxing and usually have it on continuous play as I feel you would never tire of listening to it.
1,a tempest in a teapot,"First, Harris is not credentialed and has no expertise in child psychology or any related field. Secondly, how can we believe our children are more affected by the kid down the street than by the people under whose roof they live? Harris seems to have written this book to prove she is not responsible for the problems of her adopted daughter, whose growing up years were much more difficult than those of Harris' natural born daughter. Has Harris done any reading on adopted children? It seems quite likely that much of her adopted child's problems stemmed from feelings born of being an adopted child. I believe many factors determine how a child behaves, including friends and acquaintances, heredity, etc. But I have seen all around me how individual parents affect their children by the way they treat them, the time they spend with them, the values and mores they impart, what the parents emphasize as important or unimportant, etc. Parents do matter!"
1,Poorly argued and written,"This writer relies upon a patchwork of primarily anecdotal evidence, as well as often flawed and inconsistent logic, to conclude that there is relatively little influence parents have over their children's development. This book is a superficial and ultimately unsatisfying exploration into complex and interesting issues of nature and nurture. I would recommend instead the excellent, thorough, and deeply considered book Hold on to your Kids, by Gordon Neufeld."
1,For a book that does a great disservice to American children,This book is Harris' attempt at espousing her opinion with little or no regard to scientific studies or facts. This book should appeal to those parents who want to play the blame game. This book is not for mothers and fathers who are really trying to raise their own children. She does bring up interesting correlations between genes and peers. These correlations are not based on any kind of control group and the sample size is not specified which leads you to believe she either doesn't know or care about proper research.
2,Well-written yet ultimately pointless,"OF COURSE nature matters! I don't think anyone would argue that it doesn't. But c'mon! Nurture obviously matters as well. For a better exploration of this topic, check out the brand new book ""ATTACHMENT PARENTING--Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child"" by Katie Allison Granju. Granju wrote a great review of Harris's book for Salon Magazine. It's in the archives there."
1,Whew! What a relief!,"I'm sure this book will be greatly lauded by many ""experts"" and parents alike. If I wrote a book stating that what you eat really has no effect upon your health, I know it would receive the same response. This work, standing on a mountain of specious facts (her evidence is derived mainly from questionaires, in lieu of actual studies), basically states that there is no difference between good parents or bad parents. That you have very little effect upon who your child becomes. This is great news to all the guilt-ridden parents of the world! Don't worry! Since you have such a limited influence over your child, you don't even have to set a good example! As a parent, I think this book is more than just erroneous and self-serving. Its dangerous."
4,Purchase review,The book is not in a perfect condition (a chewing was gum found between the pages:(...) but the delivery was very efficient.
3,"Interesting concept, but somewhat laborious to read","I raised teenagers into adulthood, so the conclusions of the book were nothing new for me. The author researched prodigiously and this is both the strength and weakness of the book. I would have found it more interesting and useful if she had summarized her work, spending more time on the implications for education, family relationships, etc. Buy it used/paperback and you won't regret it."
2,a little irritating,"I found this book quite boring and irritating. I found it repetetive and her conclusions became too predictable. It is largely concerned with debunking research, this is ok if you have paid a lot of attention to the research in question. If you haven't you may wonder what is the point of reading all her criticisms. I agree with her advice to get kids out of a ""bad"" peer group by moving house or schools."
3,Look at both sides before deciding,"As Barry Goldwater once said, ""Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice."" The Nurture Assumption is an extremist, and therefore extremely interesting and revealing book. The argument that genes and peer group experiences shape personality development, and families/parents do not, is presented in a one-sided, selective, and impressive broadside."
3,Very helpful but . . .,"may be hard for some to swallow whole. This book is written from within a particular ideological/ religious framework (specifically, Unity) and if one does not share this perspective some of the foundational assumptions may not work. For the non-Unity reader, the work would have been strengthened by a straightforward statement of assumptions at the very beginning. Otherwise, the statements about Universal Laws and Demonstrations can read as jargon and lead one to dismiss otherwise useful ideas. As you can tell, Unity is not my religious/philosophical framework, but still I did gain useful insights about the links between one's personal economic wellbeing and one's spiritual beliefs -- once I did what I like to call ""filtering the ideology through my teeth."""
1,Church propaganda,"This book was written to be used in Unity Church study groups all over the country to put psychological pressure on church members to tithe a tenth of their income to their local Unity Church. If you believe in tithing, you will like the book. If you don't, you won't like it. I don't like it as I believe it was written to manipulate people to feel guilty if they don't give a lot of their money to the church."
1,Book should rate a Black Hole,"After reviewing this book as a possible candidate for a college class, it is amazing how awfully stupid some companies can be at marketing. Most people who buy computer books can at least read at a college level even if they've never been there. As if the typos were not enough, the examples don't work and as the last commentor explained the code that does work on the CD is completely different from the code in the book. It's a shame that Mr. Wallace can't even walk you through a wizard without breaking the code. If you don't believe how terribly poor a book can be written then pick this up in the book store or order it with the intention of returning it. Richard Grimes's book is much better for beginners and at least the code works right out of the book. Be careful, this book will suck your brain out and make you not want to do any ActiveX development with Visual C++."
1,Another poor programming book,"Simpy put, this book is of poor quality and has a misleading title. Both the information presented and the printed code are full of errors. Furhtermore the code in the book is not the same as the code on the disk. Much of the code is so bad it takes an excessive effort to get it to compile. The title of the book ""... Using Visual C++ 6.0"" is an outright lie. The book was written for VC 5.0. The VC 6.0 information was added as an after thought (usually mentioned in the last few pages of each chapter) in an attempt to bring the book upto date before release."
1,Too bad I can't enter 0 stars.,"Although I'm only starting as a C++ programmer, even I could write better code than this guy. I was greatly amused by shortening up his very verbose code examples to just 5 or 10 lines in places.If you have the time to spend/waste/squander trying to make his programs work as presented in the book, you will learn much about the MS VC++ environment. But trust me - you won't learn much from this book!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Follow the examples step by step and don't enter any data other than what was in the screen shot or, it will blow up. This ranks right at the bottom of the pile with Scott Hillier and Dan Mesick's books. The Tom Armstrong book is outstanding and it's cheaper."
1,Too much fluff not enough substance,"If you are considering buying this book to learn ActiveX, look some where else. This book is not structured with any real logical order in teaching someone how to program. It's not even a good book to teach you how to use the ATL wizard for beginners. It falls short of any proper explaination on any of it's topics. I do not recommend this book for anybody that wants to learn how to program ActiveX."
1,Terrible waste of paper,"Most of the sample programs in the book fail to work. But, the program on the cd works but the code is completely different from the code in the book. Also, he creates ATL code with the MFC dependency just so he can use CString. Does the author know how to use standard C++ like maybe basic_string. In addition he never mentions anything about adding metafile support so that you can use the control in something other than the test container nor does he bother much with the OC96 standard. If you're not new to C++ but want to learn about ActiveX controls read Julian Templeman's MFC COM for MFC controls or Richard Grimes Beginning ATL for ATL controls. If you know C++ and stl at all this book will probably rate below most high school beginning programming books. Just make sure that you look at it in a book store first and be happy that Amazon has a return policy."
5,I really love this bag!,"For me, a bag is all about functionality and not about showing off. I'd rather spend money on something that I can carry every day rather than some fancy bag. For my money, this bag is almost perfect. It can adjust to each individual's taste in strap length, is roomy but not overly, and you don't really have to ""dumpster dive"" for stuff at the bottom. If it had a separate pouch for a cellphone, it would be perfect."
5,How To Remember Jokes: And A Whole Lot of Drop-Dead Jokes To,"It was worth the money for the jokes alone! After listening to the advice, in this recorded book, for the first time, I can actually remember jokes! Well done!"
5,LOL,IT WAS GREAT AND CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK. I WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHERS PEOPLE.
5,Slickrock,"I have read all of Laura Crum books and I love all of them, this lady is an excellent writer, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves animals especially horses."
5,Outrageous shipping costs,"I ordered 20 Sony 120 minute audio cassettes to get the ""Free Shipping on ""Orders over $25.00"" deal that was on the screen. Then I used ""One Click"" ordering. A few momements later I was astounded to see that the shipping charges of $28.59 were more than the cost of the cassettes, $26.40. With ""One Click,"" you cannot cancel an order.The ""Free Shipping for Orders over $25.00"" is deceptive advertising at its worst. Amazon should be ashamed of such practices."
4,Great Book..,"I just finished Seventeenth Summer yesterday....It was a great book that let you experience love from a young woman's eyes. I recommend this book to everyone because it is easy to read and captivating. In fact, it was soo captivating i read the whole book in one day!"
5,Great! - It voiced my own thoughts...,"Let me put it this way: I bought it yesterday, and I'm going to finish the end tonight. I really like it! Strangely enough I understood myself a lot better after reading most of it because the main charachter feels the same way I do. I told my parents that if they read it they'd understand me much better. I think anyone who wants to understand teenagers better should read this because it's very sweet (oooh... romance) and so interesting."
3,Not What I Expected,"""Seventeenth Summer by Marureen Daly, was not what I expected. I thought it would be a story about modern era love, but to my surprise this book was actually taken place in the past. Girls where dresses, all men (young and old) smoke, everyone drinks beer, helping the family take care of the house is the main priority and no internet. (What would we do today if there was no internet!) Angie and Jacks relationship continues throughout the entire book. They met at the end of school and stayed together throughout the entire summer. It was a summer to remember...""Read more at: [...]"
4,Former Fond du Lacian.,"Having grown up in Fond du Lac I was curious enough to order and read the book. Although it took place many years before I was born, many of the same places still existed in my time. A great love story. Timeless."
1,I HATE THIS BOOK,"I'm the kind of person who once I start a book I will see it through unless their is a ligitimate reason that I have to end this book. This book is awful. Way too much description of people and places. Not enough dialogue between anyone. I struggled with this book. There was hardly no romance, there was no real ending. THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE. Let me summ it up for you. I wouldn't even wipe my behind with this book its so awful. One of the worst books I have ever read. And I only say that about books I have to read. But this book I didn't have to read and it was still horrible."
2,A Drag,When i bought this book I thought it would be full of jucie love. But i was really about this girl who was going off to college and had never had never kissed a guy before. Too add on to that she never had a boyfriend before. I kept wondering when something good was going to happen but it never did. Angie was very shy she and never told her boyfriend anything. It was boring. You might like this book if you were shelterd and have no life.
3,A little boring,"I purchased and read this book for a course on young adult literature. This book was split into three long chapters, one for each month of the summer. Daly's writing is very clean (G rated) and her 40s setting was fun. Yet really the book was just about the main character, Angie, and how she managed her very first dating relationship. Most of the other books I read in the course tackled some big issues facing teens or looked at the darker side of growing up, so Seventeenth Summer was pretty boring to read at the end of the semester. I would reccomend it to anyone looking for some light reading on vacation or to girls younger than seventeen, but if you're looking for action and drama, this is not the book for you."
2,So-So,"Maybe it's just me, but I didn't enjoy this read all that much.It was 'okay', but there was nothing spectacular about it. I did not find it romantic. Maybe sweet, but definitely not romantic. It's about a girl who falls in love for the first time. She's so naive, that it kind of makes the read boring and dull for me. I suppose everyone is a bit naive during their first crush/love, but, in my opinion, there could be more interesting ways of writing/portraying that.It just came off a bit dull for me."
5,Sweet memories of first love,"Ms. Daly has superbly captured the moments of first love in this delightfully written book. Angie is a seventeen year old young woman,blossoming on the verge of a first time relationship with the adorable, star basketball player Jack. Being as inexperienced as she is with dating, she is a breath of fresh air. This book will take you back to your own first teenage romance. Ms. Daly makes you remember why you never forget your first love. Make it a tradition, as I do each year, to celebrate this wonderfully written book. Read it each summer and winsomely remember"
4,This is an exciting WWII teen novel,"I grew up in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, the setting for Maureen Daly's novel, Seventeenth Summer, and I reread this book about five years ago when I found a new paperback edition. I'd read it about 20 years earlier as well.I think it's a lovely story, capturing what it was like to live in a small Wisconsin city during the Second World War. Sadly, the locations that Ms. Daly accurately describes have been damaged beyond repair. Lakeside Park, has since been ruined by renovations, and ""Pete Mingles"" swimming area among them. Lake Winnebago has been polluted for years, so you can't swim there anymore.My mother went to St. Mary's Springs High School, just like Ms. Daly, and she once took me to McKnight's Drug Store, which had its ""Malt Shop"" in the basement. McKnight's is now a carpet store.I haven't lived in Fond du Lac for over 30 years, and don't have the happiest memories of growing up there, but I do appreciate this book."
3,Builder grade light,The light is not oil rubbed bronze. It looks like it might be brown with copper splotches painted on it. This light is a good deal for the money however it won't match your other name brand bronze items.
5,Pleased overall.,I received the book in a very timely manner and the condition was excellent. I enjoyed El Túnel and recommend it to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers.
4,A must-read book!!,It is amazing how the aothor make you keep on reading inspit of telling you the end of the book in the first line. You have to read it!!
2,Writing all over,"I did not like this item. The inside is covered in writing, which should have been specified. I probably won't be buying from these book sellers again."
3,Not as poseable as I thought,"Although the figure is highly detailed and well made, it does not satisfied my needs.I'm currently writing a storyboard for a Stop Motion and wanted to use the Djinn as the Wishmaster. Unfortunately it is not poseable at all. Arms and legs moves but it is hard to find a pose where the figure stands.It would nicely fit in a static display but if this display is shaken or moved, it will not stand."
4,great toy for little kids,bought this for our two little sons 4th of July party. It was a huge hit. They especially liked hitting the button that turned the siren on. Definitely worth the money -and easy to put up and take down.
1,is this the world's worst novel?,"There's no need to read beyond three words to answer that question. Author Savage, in this self-published tomb, begins a sentence, ""Jeff glared seductively..."" Although it did make for a laugh-filled lunch hour, as several of us attempted to mimic thesemutually exclusive facial expressions, you should save your time for something really important. Examining belly button lint, alphabetizing your prescriptions, or polishing the inside of your CD cases would all be far more productive."
3,"Laboratory Manual for Starr/Taggart;s Biology: the Unity and Diversity of Life, 9th Editin","The book was almost like new as promise, and I was very satisfied with the delivery time."
5,"""My heart is full.""",I have not seen this movie since the early 80's and would love to own it on dvd. The before mentioned quote has stuck with me all these years!!!
5,Unflinching and raw emotions.,"I absolutely adore this very poignant and exquisite family drama with comedic undertones.the acting by all the principals is simply superb.Joanne Woodward is as usual absolutely superb,unflinching in a searing and raw portrayal of an embittered woman,directed by none other than her superbly talented husband,Paul Newman.I know this type of film usually attracts a small rather esoteric audience,but it is simply a brilliant piece of cinema.I have been waiting to see it again for several decades now...I wish Fox would release it on dvd or blu-ray.five stars."
5,The effects of gamma rays on the man-in-the-moon marigolds,Would the owners of this intellectual property please release this film so we can see the truly great director Paul Newman was. It'd like to also see Beatrice's character with Joanna Woodward and finally the great performance of their daughter in this film. This was a nomination for best movie in 1972. It can't have disappear from every source available to the public. I have been trying to identify the company or person who maintains this property to ask permission to view it. Can anyone lead me to the archives that would have this movie and how to rent or obtain it?
5,A favorite Newman film,"I've heard that the family owns the rights to this wonderful but disturbing film starring Joanne Woodward and Nel Potts, directed by husband and father, the late Paul Newman. I've also heard they have no plans to release it, but I heard the same about WUSA, and I've just finally ordered it from Amazon. These films have long been two of my favorite Newman films. I'm hoping against hope that ""The Effect of the Gamma Rays"", will be released on DVD, too. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE! As a writer, I have high regard for copyright laws, and I'm fighting giving in to buying a bootlegged copy somewhere."
4,Great Live Experience,"I saw these guys this past weekend at Tivoli, an amusement park in Copenhagen, Denmark. Never heard of them before, but the show was great! Very energetic and melodic, yet plenty of rock riffs thrown in for good measure."
5,The Living Torah,A magnificent and authoritative work encompassing the 5 books of Moses. The author explains everything in English and includes numerous diagrams and annotations. A truly excellent way to understand the Torah in a contemporary living way.
5,"Best Mouth CD in a long, long time!","I've been a Mouth fan for over 10 years now, and I didn't buy Voodoo Shoppe when it first came out because I suspected that it was a ""typical"" new release with 1-3 new songs, and 8-10 previously recorded songs. (How many different ways can they record ""How Do You Tell Someone?"") But this new CD is FANTASTIC!!! Not only are the songs all originals, but the lyrics are incredible! I'll even admit that I got misty-eyed listening to The Avenue (tribute to the Hurricane victims and the Spirit of NOLA). I don't know what the source of the inspiration was, but thank you Fred, JTG and Paul!!! I've missed you!!!Don't question buying this CD, people - DO IT and buy copies for your friends. They'll thank you forever! (And don't miss seeing them on tour - they're better than ever!)"
1,Heartless and Soulless,"This group represents the absolute bottom of the barrel in music. Heartless and soulless only begin to describe their generic sound. Some other words, lazy, boring, mind numbingly unintelligent. Please lets unite to stop Cowboy Mouth before they turn another helpless person completely tone deaf."
3,Much larger than expected,"I'm sure this is a great helmet for protecting your skull in times of need; I can't give it lower than a 3 for that. But I just was expecting something much... well... cooler. This thing looks like I'm wearing another head on top of my head. It's huge. For some reason I pictured something that fit closer to my head, smaller, and that had less bulk. I realize, that the point is to meet safety standards, and it's probably my fault for not realizing that it was going to be just as disappointingly un-stylish as other bike helmets, but I'm just telling others so if they had similar expectations as me.My goal is to find a helmet that looks good. I'm looking for function, but more style over function. I'm a casual biker living in a small town. My helmet is there to protect me from scrapes if a wheel falls off at 1 mile per hour. I'm on a mission to find such a helmet... I'll update this review when I've found that pot of gold."
4,It works,"The helmet is comfortable, but in case you're looking to get the ""Matte Red Demon"" version, please note that the graphic designing extents to the other side of the photo being displayed.It dismayed me that I had to find that out once I received the package, im tempted to spray paint the whole thing.So aside from the graphic designing (in the Matt Red version) which I thought was limited to one side of the helmet, it is of good quality and comfortable. You receive different sizes of ""inside pads"" to adjust its fit to your liking."
3,Obnoxiously huge helmet despite correct size,"I've worn helmets for skateboarding in the past and I didn't think that this helmet would look so huge on my head. I bought a medium sized matte black helmet and when I received it, wow, totally huge. I went to a Sports Authority store to see the same helmets there (at a higher overhead price) to see if a small made a difference. This helmet is just flat out huge by default. When I wore it the first time around while riding my bike, my girlfriend thought I was going to Iraq to fight the war because she thought I had a military helmet on (lol). It was quite cumbersome to wear while riding my road bike. I didn't know if it was more of a hazard than a safety component to my regiment for riding bikes. I returned the item. Definitely not for me. I would probably focus on buying a helmet that doesn't make you turn into a pumpkin head. The photos of this helmet are quite misleading."
4,Is what they say it is.,No problems. Got it for snow skiing. Went skiing with it and worked just fine. Had no major falls but looks like it would protect well. Wore a balaclava under it and head was easily warm. The temp though was not colder than upper 20s/lower 30s. No wind.I have a large head and have trouble with hats/helmets being big enough. Often a size large is not big enough (sometimes even extra large isn't) but this helmet in large fit easily. Comes with multiple pads to fit it to your head more precisely.Happy with it.
5,Fantastic Helmet,This helmet is really well made. It's also comfortable because there's alot of padding inside. I like all the air vents...they help to keep you cooler. Overall this is a great value for the money.
4,Great helmet for melon heads.,"My head is approximately 59cm in circumference, and this helmet fits me using the thinnest set of included pads. Sadly, I left it on campus somewhere at UVU and now someone else has it. Also, the pricing is variable, so if you pick a less-popular design you'll save a little money. It is a little bulky and not the lightest helmet I have worn, but also very solid. I use it for bicycling and longboarding."
4,"Basic, but perfect","The BELL stickers are plastic and remove easily. I bought the basic black one. I like it. It comes with thin, medium, and thick cushions so you can fit it to your head. I bought this style of helmet because I don't care to look ""fast"", with the aerodynamic competitive racing bike helmet standard style. So when guys wearing a couple grand of gear, bike included, pass me, they'll know I'm transporting groceries, not training for a race. This helmet says nothing, except: I'd prefer a buffer between my head and the pavement when a texting driver runs a stop sign and plows me over. This helmet replaces the one that saved my scalp some serious road rash when the last in-a-hurry driver finally came to a halt 20 feet past the big red sign that says STOP."
4,Great helmet!,I thought my 14 year old son would hate the color but he absolutely loves this item. Fits snugly and seems to serve its purpose.
5,my great bright helmet!,"This is a great helmet, haven't needed it's protection in an accident yet, but I wear it no matter how short the bike ride is. The helmet fits true to size, and color and description are right on. It's a comfortable helmet and stylish....fashionable and functioning!"
4,good helmet,"The sizing was not as accurate as I would have liked. My head measured right in the middle of the small helmet - but with the padding inside the helmet it was a brain squeezer. I advise to measure as directed and then probably go up a size. They come with an extra set of pads, so when the old ones become soiled, you can replace them. The different colors are great - I got 6 of them for the family, including myself."
5,Cute Helmet,This is a good quality helmet at a good price. The design is very fun and the helmet is very comfortable. Just what I was looking for.
5,Great product - Versatile & Certfied safe!!!,One of the few that is dual certified! Plus a Huge thumbs up in the looks department from my 12 year old boy & very satisfied parents that it can take the beating from speeds that cycling might deliver or the hard bounce that skateboarding flips & tricks could bring. & a great price :))
5,My son liked it!,The helmet is very comfortable according to my son. The mat finish makes it very cool-looking.
3,for the skaters or hard core bikers,good looking helmet but more for the skater crew than a casual biker like me.
2,no good protection: sizing chart is inaccurate,"This helmet has no protection around the front, back or sides.Bad purchase.Seller was slow to ship the item.Over priced."
5,Tony Hawk Helmet,"Great product. Looks good and works well! Very sturdy and easy to adjust the chin straps. Well-cushioned on the inside of the helmet. The only negative was not about the product, but about trying to find out the right size. There was no sizing chart, even though there was a link to it, I could never get to it. I crossed my fingers and got lucky."
4,Protection and aesthetics.,"This is the exact helmet I has in mind when I was looking for a ""Cool"" helmet. It has the shape and look of a skating helmet as opposed to the weird obviously-foam biking helmet. I put it on my head, made a few adjustments, and was on my way (I ripped off the ""Bell"" sticker and put on one of my own.).The only thing that might be an issue is that it is hotter than it maybe should be. There are vents, but maybe there are not as many or they are not as well placed as the ones in the helmets the kids make fun of. I sweat in this helmet. A Lot. But that is a trade-off. I would rather sweat than look un""Cool""."
5,Well-built helmet.,"I've never worn a helmet while cycling. Start riding a bike when I was cycling four years old and I am much older now. I really did not like the design of most of the other helmets. They looks sort of dorky. When I found these on Amazon, I really like the looks of them. When I received it I was very please find that it is a beautiful helmet. It is constructed well and fits perfectly. Additional pads come with it, so you can ensure yourself a proper fit. I think my only complaint is that it was hard to find the sizing chart. I had to go to the Bell site to find one. If you're like me and you to where cool helmet get this one. JC"
3,Not among the best,"I love Iommi's work and thought his solo album IOMMI was overlooked years ago considering how good it was.In fact, IOMMI was MUCH, MUCH better than this FUSED album.Problem 1: The modern production saps the power out of Ioomi's trademark guitar tone and dominance. It has a washed out sound to the guitars with too many cute studio tricks tossed in.Problem 2: Glenn Hughes..... Sorry, I have never liked that nasal twanging sound he has when singing and unlike many I never found his voice to be a good match to Iommi's guitar styles in the past or now.FUSED is tons better than the crap most bands release now, but I dont listen to that stuff either.I gave away my copy of FUSED as I knew I would never want to listen to it anymore.On the otherhand, IOMMI solo album and DEHUMANIZER are two relatively newer Iommi albums that still sit in my car's CD changer."
2,I expected better,"I'm a HUGE Glenn Hughes fan and an equally HUGE Black Sabbath (and, thus, Tony Iommi) fan. I had high expectations for ""Fused"" but I was very disappointed. I should've listened to the song samples before buying this. Every song sounds pretty much the same, which would be okay if ""the same"" meant good. Unfortunately, mediocre is a better description. Damn."
2,A decent Iommi effort destroyed by Glenn Hughes,"Not one of Tony's best efforts, but there are moments worth the price of admission. But it's hard to get over Glenn Hughes's vocals. Just horrible stuff. Where did this guy come from, and what was Tony thinking?"
5,This Fuse Burns Hot,"First off I would like to thank ""cd-heaven"" for his informative review of the Hughes and Iommi collaboration. However, I am looking to the future and hoping that after the Sabbath Summer tour, Tony and Glenn will find a way to be on the road together. If so, then I'm there. Until then I recommend all Iommi and Heavy Metal Hughes fans to purchase ""Fused"", ""1996 DEP Sessions"" and ""Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi"" and figure out for youself the songs you really want to hear live."
2,How people sometimes overestimate an album...,"Of course, in this mediocre and utterly obnoxious musical scenario we have nowadays (thanks in great part to MTV, the Grammy awards), old giants like Iommi and Hughes, evn when deliver a moderately shineless record, are much better than the new artists.But this album is simply not good. A lot of the songs seem the same, with a dreadful nu-metal style to some of them. There's nothing here so amazing as some reviews say. Nothing here is even as good as THE ETERNAL IDOL or even THE SEVENTH STAR 9to mentin another albume featuring Iommi and Hughes).Mos of the sogns are slow, boring, pedestrian. The exception goes for WHAT YOU'RE LIVING FOR. as for Hughes vocals, of course they are still breathtaking. But the songs.."
1,1.5 stars- Even worse than 96' Dep Sessions,"I got to tell you that I can hardly stand Glenn Hughes' singing voice. He just sounds crazy and makes Tony Martin look like the greatest singer that ever lived. Let's get back to making Black Sabbath albums with Tony on board. Okay, Mr.Iommi! I'm sure there are probably millions who agree with me about Glenn's voice. I think Mr.Iommi should take a long break, and think about getting Tony back, and when you know you got some good writing, then give the Sab thing a go again. This cd sounds more like hard driving rock, than any type of metal. Save your money folks, and maybe go out and buy an Iced Earth cd."
2,"Disappointed, again. Makes me sad!","I have been a die-hard Tony Iommi supporter for decades. When Ozzy left, I supported Iommi. When Dio left, I supported Iommi. I followed Sabbath, and still listen to my Sabbath cd's. But the three Iommi cd's that I have purchased, including this one, FUSED, have all disappointed me. In this case, it's more about Glenn Hughes, whose voice I find annoying on this effort.I would love to have seen Iommi team up with someone like David Lee Roth, or when Rob Halford was still roaming solo. Tony needs a GREAT vocalist, and he comes out strong. Tony is a great performer, love his riffs, but they are drowned out by the annoying Glenn Hughes on this album. Heck, even someone like Joe Lynn Turner would have been an improvement on Glenn Hughes. Isn't Vince Neil looking for a job these days?Ug, so yeah, this album is ONLY for the die hard Tony Iommi and/or Glenn Hughes fan. Otherwise, by an older Sabbath album."
4,The riffs got me hooked on first listen,"Riff meister Iommi is at it again and he is always interesting to listen to. Hughes and Iommi make a good team and should reform Sabbath with Hughes as the frontman. To heck with Ozzy, Hughes has a good rock voice. Reminds me of Sabbath of the 80s- good stuff."
5,Amazing,"Just an amazing record from the riff-God Tony Iommi.This record will please all Black Sabbath fans, as it has the heavy and dark vibe that the band has always delivered, and it also includes a top-notch Glenn Hughes performance.The music is perfect, and the mood of the record is unbelievable.Get it, you CANT be disappointed with this one."
4,This Rocks,The godfather of Metal still has it. Catchy riffs and melodies. Balsy guitar work and vocals!
4,"Good product, but make sure it is right for you, and you ready for it","This Tripp Lite is the workhorse of my office branches. It has good run time, will take the load of our servers and Power-Over-Ethernet (POE) applications. Always know the load of your devices and do not think that the inexpensive versions will work with connected devices more than once. You will destroy these units if you overload them, so always overspec slightly.Things to know about these are that you need to keep the fan vents clean, so make sure you periodically blow them out to prevent overheating and fan failure. ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE that these require a NEMA L5-20P outlet, which has a 90-degree rotated prong (the outlet prongs look like a T on its side), and you need to make sure the AC circuit will support that draw and on a 20A breaker."
2,Disappointing Production Values,"Mr. Young is an inspiring teacher, but this tape sounds like it was speeded up to fit on one cassette. He talks so fast that it rather negates the calming intent of meditation. Mr. Young, if you're out there, expand it to two tapes or cut it."
5,"between ondaatje, james salter, chekhov and tatiana tolstoya","found this on the table at the strand. hooked by the opening, mesmerized by the rest. the story of a russian ex-pat and the three loves of her life: 1) a childhood neighbor in st. petersberg; 2) a sickly man with whom she moves to paris; 3) another russian ex-pat in paris. told in a simple, intense, musical, oblique, emotionally impressionistic voice. kind of reminded me of a cross between ondaatje, james salter, chekhov and tatiana tolstoya. there's a beautiful passage near the end of the novel where berberova describes the passengers she sees in a train adjacent to hers, first passing her by, then stopping so that she sees the same passengers quickly in reverse, then once again passing her by for good and leaving an open vista (something i experience daily on the subway commute to work, sans the open vista). it's exactly what reading her story is like."
5,Carreras at his best!,The golden voice still got its old magic. A marvellous collection of songs that suit that world-famous tenor voice like tailored up for it. José Carreras sings these popular classics with the velvet sound he is so famous for. I'm sure this album will win the maestro a lot of new fans!
1,"Ave Satani, Versus Chr...what da?","Wasssyuup!This is the one and only E-Man(The Southerner)and I know whats up with ole Jon boy Taylor has used other re-views for his reviews look at the first ""Along Came a Spider""review and tell me what you see. Ok, now to the soundtrack,Iam a big Goldsmith fan and I burned two ten bills on it.First, it sounds cheap. Secondly, it all sounds the same. Thirdly, it gets old real fast. Fourth, after a month you just don't want to listen to it. If you want a good Goldsmith score, get ""Air Force One"", ""Along Came a Spider"", ""Star Trek:"" 1,5,8,9---they are GREAT!! This is NOT!!! This is NOT!!NOT!!!NOT!!!."
5,"Hauntingly Chilling, and Perfectly Composed","I am a huge fan of Jerry Goldsmith, but the undeniably most impactive score that I've ever heard under his name is this CD.The 1976 success of Richard Donner's masterpeice is without a doubt 86% due to Jerry Goldsmith's requiem-stylized suites.The tracks that stand out in this lister's brain are ""Ave Satani,"" (once you hear in on the movie track, it will be instantly engraved in your mind.) ""The Dog's Attack,"" enormously beacuse, when I hear it, my mood changes--as does with any music I listen to) and, course, who can forget the pressing motif in ""the Altar"" (I love it, and so will you.)So, if your looking to listen to a killer score that will blow you out of your seat, slip this sweet little CD in and prepare yutrself for this beautifully remastered 25th Anniversary Edition of Jerry Goldsmith score to one of the most memmorable films of our time--THE OMEN----Jerry or G I G I"
3,Less than celestial,"This book was a particularly slow read for such a short book. It was a dull story with little resolution at the end. We read this book as a book club. At our meeting, we sat mystified as to what to discuss. I did not enjoy this attempt at a novel, and would probably not recommend it unless you have time to read it more than once to try to follow the stale story."
5,My young kids love this movie!,My 2 and 3 year olds LOVE this movie. They will sit still for the whole movie. It's a cute movie for kids and adults will laugh a few times too.
1,don't buy plastic,"I bought the lime squeezer, and it snapped in half the 2nd time I used it. uggghhhhh, going with metal this time"
1,"Purchased twice, broke twice","I purchased the acrylic lime squeezer at the local supermarket for $3.99 and it broke after a few uses. So I returned it and got a replacement which broke the second time I used it. If you squeeze to hard or too fast, the acrylic breaks by the hinge. Metal is definitely the way to go with lemon/lime squeezers. However, keep it clean and dry immediately after use, or the paint coating can eventually peel away as mine did."
1,Expectations~,"This CD was a huge dis-appointment to this new ager. Not at all in line with what moves my soul and transcends my fantasies.Rasa Mellow was much better, but NOTHING can move and make a difference to this lady like, Zingaia's ""Dancers of Twilight"", or Deepak's, ""a Gift of Love 11, oceans of ectasy.""Even my feline's get mello and low and very ""into them."" As do they and I, get into Enigma, Afro Celt Sound System.This music, Rasa Exotica, lacked the sensual and erotic rhythms of East India."
1,Not worth the money,This book is not worth the money. Most of the ideas and suggestions are nothing that you already don't know.
5,A great resource to help find the mate of your dreams,"If you are single and feel like you're stuck trying to find the mate of your dreams then this book just might be what you need. Well written and easy to read, you'll find it hard to put the book down. Getting the reader to find a perfect match is what this book is all about. It covers all of the basic steps needed to make this a reality. At the end of each chapter there are a series of action items that help to apply the material covered in the text. This book is a great resource for singles of all ages."
1,Single No More.,"This product is not what it is advertised to be. More than a third of it is how to write a personal ad in the newspaper and how to respond to it. In the days of the internet, not sure this is relevant anymore or really the best way to pick up a date. Additional content is basic Psych 101, (as most of her stuff is), and better information on getting dates could be picked up at the office water cooler."
5,"If you weave, you need this book!",I never really understood how to correctly warp a loom until I got this book. It's so much easier than I thought and much easier to understand than any other book focusing on warping only. I think it's even better than taking a class because you can read and warp at your own pace without being distracted by someone elses' bad habits or personal preferences.
3,Good info,"This book is a little dated, but it has some useful tips for warping your loom without assistance. I wish there were photos to accompany some of the descriptions."
5,Great book,This will help me in my SCA hobby!!! Now I just have to learn how to weave using the book ;)
4,Works well and comes with the bands to use.,"I chose this because I trust Losi with their quality of tools and supplies. I was not let down with this. I like that it comes with rubber bands to hold the tire tight.The glue gives you a bit of time to work with when you're gluing tires on, but next time I'll buy a thicker formula that doesn't dry so quickly since I'm not great at gluing and need a little leeway in drying time."
4,new age music with quality,"Ray Lynch does a good job if you like instrumental, soothing (elevator) music. It is pleasant, relaxing music that is good for background while you are reading or doing something low key. Like most music, some instrumentals I really like and others aren't so hot. (I personally take what I like and put it on a separate CD.)"
3,Sounds too contrived,"I bought this CD based on the reviews here because I wanted something spacey and soothing and figured the strong rating would get me that, sound unheard... I listened to this CD three times. It puts me on the edge because every time I have listened to this whole CD it sounds contrived and a bit too forced, formulaic, and childishly(in an annoying sense) simplistic..Sorry, it goes into my seldom played bin while I look for something really comfortable, spacey, and relaxing for my tastes. The rest of you? Please enjoy!"
2,A Dud,"I was very disappointed. Celestial Soda Pop is the only good thing on the CD, and it's not that great. The music is quite uninspired."
1,worst cd I ever bought,"I bought this cd, thinking that the music would be uplifting, and I was very disappointed. This music is downright creepy. It sounds like background music for a science fiction flick."
5,Best CD ever,"I grew up on this cd, and to this day it brings me a sense of peace. It is a soothing and relaxing musical journey that will help to calm the troubled soul."
5,Brings me back,"When I came across this title on Amazon, I listened to a sample of ""Celestial Soda Pop"" and it brought a tear to my eye (yeah, I'm a sentimental fool). I first heard this album when I was 16 and hearing it again after so many years have passed has reminded me of a simpler time in my life. I have been an amature artist ever since I was old enough to pick up a paintbrush and this album was constantly playing whenever I sketched or painted. The music, although completely electronic, is calming to the soul and soothes the heart. Whether you are a ""new age"" music fan or not, this album will make you feel wonderful."
5,just close your eyes,"I'm relatively new to this album, but it's simply amazing. The whole album flows together flawlessly. I only first heard it 3 weeks ago, and i'v listened to the whole album straight through everyday since. It's hard to case this into a specific genre. To me, very spaced, relaxing, yet intense....Some call it new age, to me just fine music."
4,"Sweet, restful haven for the soul","This is a new age classic. The songs are varied in tone, melodic and calming, putting me in a calm upbeat mood. I love to read to this one. My favorite Lynch CD."
5,Christmas Gift,We needed it for a christmas gift and the price was right. Can't wait til March 2 for the final one!
4,Liked the way it translated to the screen.,"It was good, and followed the book well, unlike Twilight. However, the music drove me crazy. Twilight's music was moody and modern. In New Moon, if I closed my eyes, I could imagine a melodrama from the 50s. So story good, music annoying.I was also disappointed that the colors tended to blend into each other. There were some times when it was crisp and clean, and others not so much. Again, I liked Twilight for it's weird blue/gray coloring and crisp clear visual.All in all, if you like the book, you will like this movie."
3,Instant video,"The movie itself was great, but the quality of the instant video was extremely poor. The video was very grainy."
4,Great movie,Great movie. I just wish there had been more of Edward in it. Made you want more and more .
1,too drull,there really was no plot despite it being fiction and knowing that werewolves and vampires don['t existit just was bleak
4,Liked better than the original,"I enjoyed this better than the original and much better than the book. The ""Jacob Saga"" part wasn't as drawn out. Actually watched it twice in 48 hours. End left me ready to rent the next installment."
5,Twi-hard dream!,"Love, love, love this edition! Previously had the Eclipse and BD1 Target exclusives and just had to have the first two in the same edition. Finally found them and I must say, I love this one! The necklace is such a great addition! Well made and looks great. Not Jared's diamonds quality, of course, but the pendant looks great and is two sided! What a cool addition!! You most definitely need to own this series of collector's editions if you are a Twi-hard!"
2,one of the worst non-movies,"If you think the book is bad, the movie is worse. You are better off watching the trailers because then you at least get to miss the fluff and filler shoved in to make it a longer movie. Kind of like you can just read the first and last pages of the books, you probably get a better story."
5,Just what I ordered,"My product was shipped in a timely manner, and it was just what I ordered. I am very pleased."
5,Twilight Rocks,"I am a total Twihard! I had to have this three disc dvd of New Moon. The third disc has deleted scences,the film's music,Interview with the Volturi, Fandimonium and more. A must for anyone addicted to theTwilight Saga!"
2,Buyer beware,"The DVD was scratched, the case was a little damaged and the leaflet was not in the case. This seller should be honest what she/he/they are putting out and not lie how new it is."
1,biazare movie,"bizare movie about a big headed girl who wears a lot of make up hanging around 2 boys too socially incompetentthe whole movie is like watching a commercial, however it is not that that makes it a problemthe movie is sooo weird, basically its like a dirty fantasy, which shows women expressiveness as suppression so much in a way that it is exploded into such films as the twilight sagathe movie is however, still good as something funny to laugh at, the scenes contain physically impossible occurrences,the film is based about some weird girl and how she is ""so important"" and two ""exremely cool boys"" who ""just cant get enough of her"" they battle each other in seeing who is the most ""valuble person""so its pretty much a commercial film , not that commercial films are ugly, but this one particularlu stinks, i know some movies have to go with the trends, but it would be nice is some artistic if not more was added into script"
2,Really?,"This was not a good film. Some of the scenes were hilarious in how cheesy they were. ""Oh you have a tiny scratch, well I should take off my shirt then...for the scratch."" It was also really boring. The only reason it doesn't get one star is because the WOLVES ARE AWESOME! But aside from that its really not worth seeing let alone buying."
2,Vegetarian Vampires Are Human Too,"The ""Twilight"" books don't hold up very well if you compare them to ""Salem's Lot"" by Stephen King or ""They Thirst"" by Robert McCammon. I don't want to insult anyone by saying they are pretty much total garbage, but they are. Teenage girls will be squirming in their seats just to see Jacob's Abs of Steel when he takes his shirt off. Poor Bella can't decide. Who does she love more, Edward an Jacob? Oh, the agony!"
3,blah!!,"I went to see New Moon also and I must say that after reading the book there was so much more that could have been shown. Mostly I think that it missed the mark, although new moon wasn't my favorite book I'm still buying the dvd when it comes out. I'm hoping when Eclipse comes out here in June that they dig into the background of the characters and how they came to be. I can't wait for Breaking DaWN to see how close it wiil come to being like the book. To me there was just so much more that could have been told."
1,Poor Bella,"As I watch what must be the WORST movie of the year I can't help but feel sorry for poor Bella.If her boyfriend isn't a boring vampire then her other boyfriend is a boring werewolf! Me thinks Bella should dump both of them, go back to Florida, live with her mother and find herself a nice Jewish boy.Is this is a new trend in he horror genre? To bore people to death?"
1,One Word Movie Review,"Meh.There are way too many negative reviews out here that break down every little thing wrong with this movie. Instead, let me just state this, I can't think of a better movie to resurect MST3K with.The plot is a bit disturbing as well, a girl has to make a choice between beastality and necrophillia."
1,sub zero+++,"DVD is not worth the PET it is printed on. A love story between werewolf and vampire? No! Thats a Movie without any action, no SFX, no heart blood, so boaring that i wonder why even the vampires did not die of thirst. The werewolves? Their transitions to animated fur balls had been the best scenes in that movie.So dear Bosses of ""Summit Entertainment"" - please fire those yappie managers who accepted that screenplay before you go bankrupt or they abort your studio.Sorry - i did not imagine that such a bad DVD had been promoted this year.The good news - never watched such a time wasting movie nor i expect that such exists."
2,Wow,"I am the type of person that will give any movie a chance despite what all the critics say, but this one was a force to be reckoned with... a devastatingly boring one. I have never wanted to leave a theater during a movie, but the thought crossed my mind several times. It is just long and whiny. I love that everyone says that if you have read the books you will be a huge fan. Just because something is popular doesn't mean that it is good, smart, or cutting edge. I gave it a 2 star simply because it was so bad that its great to make fun of. Wait! If you got a scratch reading this review let me take my shirt off in extra slow motion for you. Good God people."
2,Very disappointed in this set's lack of extras,"The good news: New Moon is much better done than Twilight and the acting is also much improved.The bad news (and the reason for the low rating): This version of the DVDs does not contain any deleted or extended scenes. And the only commentary is by the director and editor. (I enjoyed their commentary but would have liked to hear the actors' take, too.)There's already a very nice review here by E-Transitions who took the time to list out where you have to buy other DVD versions of this movie if you want the extras Summit did not include in this version. I don't buy a lot of DVDs, so perhaps this greedy practice of parceling out the extras between different versions in order to get buyers to purchase multiple copies is standard, but I think it's awful and I'm really mad."
2,Terrible Special Features!,"The add-ons are complete garbage on this edition, don't waste your money! Read the review by the person who stated which stores are selling which versions."
3,Buyer beware!,"Just an FYI- this is labeled special edition, but there is nothing special about it... it is bare bones with the special features.... It contains NO deleted scenes or anything remotely interesting"
3,"Review movie, have not read the books","That being said....I did not really care for this movie. It jumped around alot and I felt like the editing was off or something, I could almost hear the director yelling ""Cut!"", then we were on to another scene. I guess I was just hoping for more."
3,"Good quality, but not as advertised.","I knocked off two stars, because the product picture and description is inaccurate, and Amazon should update it. The alternate audio track is in French, not Spanish, and is the Canadian release, not the American. I was confused when I received the Canadian version of the blu ray, but after reading some other reviews, I did a little research and found that this is the E1 (Entertainment One) release (not Summit Entertainment). E1 is a licensed, third-party distributor based out of Ontario, Canada. That is why it is in English & French, instead of English & Spanish. It is not a knock-off. It is a legal copy, although not likely intended to be sold in the U.S.Despite the fact that it is not as advertised, I am not returning it, because it was only $10 and without defect.***UPDATE*** I have uploaded a scan of the blu ray I received to the photos in the description."
3,if your kid likes it - watch it so you can discuss with them,"Bella drives me friggin nuts with her lack of enthusiasm - could have had a mannequin play the part. But that isn't what my review is about. There are many scenes in the movie that a parent could (and should in my opinion) discuss with their child (presuming they are old enough to understand). Obsession, lack of respect for parents (father mostly), running away, lies, taking extreme chances to learn if ""he"" loves me (her cliff jumping to the water), being possessiveness of another person, I could go on and on. These all present wonderful opportunities to openly discuss with your son/daughter about what they are watching and (unfortunately) learning in the movie - good discussions about how incorrect the scenes are and why. Whether the children are male/female doesn't matter as each should not behave the way these characters do. Why 3 stars - well the movie isn't a complete disaster, I do love the scenery. Middleborough, MD"
5,saga,"Obviously bought these movies for my teenagers. I love them also, I admit. Great movies. can't wait to see them all"
2,Still Crap,"Still disappointing. I really had hope but between the garble'd lines and poor acting it was pretty hard to stomach. I think the wolves chasing the vampire was the highlight of the movie. It completely lacked any emotional connection, I think it was actually worse than twilight if that's even possible. It completely amazes me that with such a huge budget and fan base, they still can't even get close to getting it right. The cheesy outfits, the make-up, even the soundtrack was bad. Go read the books, there's no comparison."
3,Sappy story of codependent teen,"Rob Pattinson's acting in this leaves much to be desired. There is way too much of Taylor Lautner's pecs and biceps portrayed. While Kristen Stewart's acting is solid, her character is absolutely pitiful in this movie. Anytime she breaks up with a guy, she acts like she can't live. I would never, ever want my teenage daughter believing she can't survive without the love of her life. What a disturbing tale of codependency! Also, I thought the music was used too much in this movie. It seemed to distract and take away from the action."
2,Does not have deleted scenes,"The sale was an ok good deal. Mistakenly, I thought I was buying the DVD set with deleted scenes. Honestly, how can you call this a special without deleted scenes."
2,Hilarious,"Hilarious. The first Twilight movie just sucked but this one was worth watching for the unintentional humor every time Robert Pattinson came on screen. Seriously, I think they overdid the sensitive thing if that was what they were going for with his character....Anyway, I gave it two stars because I don't think it the movie was well made but I might have given it more if I were just judging things based on whether I enjoyed the movie or not, because it genuinely did make me laugh."
2,They sent me the French DVD!,I ordered this as a present for my Edward Cullen loving wife. It arrived and I was surprised to see it was the French version of the DVD. Great language but I would prefer English on the DVD menus and in the film. Nowhere on the description does it tell you they are sending the French DVD.
4,Amazing,"If you're a Twilight fan, then you'll definitely enjoy this movie. Great quality, quick shipping too!"
3,"""New Moon"" is full of giant pauses with Bella & Edward, Jacob is a little more interesting","Length:: 5:24 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie ""New Moon"", starring Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner.[...].[...].[...].[...]."
2,alright...more adolescent than the first,I actually did enjoy this movie. It's entertaining but I did feel like I was watching a movie for young teens. More dramatic and less plot..in fact it was pretty predictable.
2,easily the WORST of the Twilight trilogy!,"Oy, there were certain places in this movie when I was just cringing and howling, that's how bad it was...some of the most appallingly corny, dopey dialogue and ridiculous plotlines imaginable. Imagine the first episode with the cheesy scenes amped up about ten times, and without the more decent parts.The ladies will be pleased by Jacob's newfound buffness, however. I wonder how much of it was CGI...I would definitely recommend skipping this episode and going directly to Eclipse, the 3rd installment."
1,nothing to this,"theres no story, and even worse than the books this drags on with no end in site. Oh wow, there are vampires...whoop'd do. There are vampires in how many other movies, and they don't sparkle"
3,great Movie but this version GIVE IT A MISS,"THIS MOVIE IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL TWILIGHT FANS HOWEVER I JUST RECEIVED MY COPY AND I HAVE WATCHED IT THROUGH.IF YOU ARE INTO THE BONUS FEATURES THIS VERSION IS ONE TO CONSIDER NOT BUYINGTHWE FEATURES ARE VERY LIMITED INDEED IT HAS A 65 MINUTE FEATURETTE AND MUSIC VIDEOS BUT UNLIKE THE ENGLISH RELEASE WHICH HAS OVER 3 HOURS OF BONUS CONTENT I WOULD RECONSIDER.THERE ARE NO DELETED SCENES, BECOMING JACOB, MEET THE WOLFPACK JUST TO NAME A FEW...I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY PURCHASE AND I WOULD RECCOMEND A DIFFERENT VERSION THEN THE DVD 2 DISK SET.I GIVE THIS 3 STARS BECAUSE I LOVE THE MOVIE ITS 5 STARS BUT BECAUSE OF THE CONTENT I CAN ONLY GIVE IT 3."
5,New Moon,New Moon kept me on the edge of my seat. The action was fantastic and the men were to die for.
5,Wonderful price,"I gave this movie as a gift for Christmas. I could not beat the price of the video even in the story, fantastic."
4,The beginning of the end,"The story is the perfect wrap up to the twilight series The interplay between characters is wonderful. If you love romance, get this movie."
5,Twi-Fans only,"I liked the book better, although, I thought they portrayed a portion in the book well in the movie. Whether you are a fan or not, you will still be able to follow the movie and enjoy it."
1,they did not sell to me the item that they describe,"in the description they say that it has audio and subtitles in Spanish and is a lie, they delivered to me two movies of the saga twilight only in English."
3,Not pre-ordering from Amazon again!,"WARNING: the 2nd disc doesn't have any deleted or extended scenes. If I had known that, I would have ordered from another source."
4,Blu ray quality excellent,"I got a new blu ray player and this was my first blu ray DVD. The quality was excellent. While I had already seen this movie several times in the theatre, the behind the scenes extras made this purchase especially worthwhile."
4,New Moon adaptation to film flows well,"Taking into account the style of the first movie in the series, New Moon flows along without any major artistic/directional hiccups. The book to film adaptaion doesn't lose too much from the story line, and the actors all did a great job portraying the characters."
4,New Moon,Good movie. Better than Twilight. The characters are coming into their own. Love the Italian scenery. Aro is ...well he is Aro.this movie keeps with the book for about 95%.
3,happy -sort of,the movie came in great shape but unfortunately it had no case and since it was a gift I returned it.
1,"Unless it's shipped directly from Amazon, it's made in Mexico!","Very disappointed. I placed 3 separate orders and 4 of the dvds, including this one, were made from Mexico. It clearly shows on Amazon site one cover with English only text, but the DVD you get is stamped 'Made in Mexico', a different cover, and the Title & narrative are written in English and Spanish. So if the price is 'too good to be true' and does not come directly from Amazon, this is probably what you will get. Yes, you can return it, and yes, it is a big hassle. Hope this saves some people the trouble I went through..."
1,Buffy did it better.,A whiny little girl goes into a snit because her stalker boyfriend leaves her. She then gets with another creeper/pedophile and continually sucks at all forms of life. I just saved you two hours.
4,Great movie...not great extras,"Of course the movie is great...but the extras were not impressive. The ""special features"" disc does not have much on it to begin with and what it does have was not something I thought was worth the time it took to watch them."
2,"""I guess the wolf is out of the bag."" - Blu ray review","I find myself after watching New Moon asking ""WHY? WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME?"" The movie is an overblown pre-teen after school special! What do you girls see in this crap. The story is boring and childish. I can understand a young girl who still has Hannah Montana posters up in her room falling all over this but WOMEN? ADULT WOMEN?A vampire movie (especially one versus werewolves or dogs on steroids) should have a little more pulse pounding excitement. People spend good money to be entertained and just like TWILIGHT, I was bored silly. The movie does have some interesting concepts in it but the execution is terrible and lacking.NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: I am disgusted that there are several versions out depending on where you buy it. That is a joke and an insult to the consumer. The print is strong and the sound is a nice mix. Special features are bland. FINAL THOUGHTS: I wish I rented or borrowed it. THIS IS A MUST OWN FOR FANS (no one else)."
2,2 Disc Trick,"My daughter talked me into buying the 2 disc instead of the single copy because of the scenes to the follow up ""Eclipse"" movie. (We bought it at Walmart.) What a waste of money! You can view more on a trailer preview online! The other ""extras"" were pathetic. My reaction was ""That's it?!""I wish I had read the other reviews before I caved into buying the ""Twilight"" 2 disc Fan Edition. Just get the single copy and you'll save money. The movie is really all that's important anyway."
4,Because of the book,"I bought all the Twilight Saga DVDs because of the book. However, the book has more in it. I received the movie just as quick as I ordered it. The movie was in good condition. I bought it used, and had no problems with it."
5,... Brilliant...,"Actually bought Twilight when it first launched in 09... Was not in love. Then I watched the Fourth of the series over the weekend and re-watched Twilight again, and fell in love. Watched New Moon last night and am planning on watching Eclipse either tonight or within the next few nights. The movies are easy to follow with just the right amount of edge without going over board. The love affair of Kristen Stewart and Robert is very sweet and pure considering he is a Vampire and she is a normal girl without judgement.After viewing True Blood and all the gore, the Twilight Saga is a world apart. It comes together more logically for the viewer, nothing so over the top that even a tween or teen could watch and enjoy.The color and animation are sensational...the transformation of the humans to wolves was cupable without being terrifying. Would recommend the entire Saga for anyone seeking a light love story mixed with some tasteful well done humor and a twist."
2,sub-par acting,"Perhaps its their ages - they are young adults and I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here, they may not have accrued much acting experience.Don't get me wrong, I mean, I enjoyed the books. The CGI is well done, the locations are beautiful filmed."
5,AWESOME,"the entire Twilight saga is awesome. My daughter got to watch New Moon, which was the first movie I watched, I became hooked on the entire saga, I have watched all the movies and read all the books. We are planning a Twilight night, watching all of the movies back to back. Cant wait for my order to get here!!!!"
2,Not my cup of blood...,"Let me start by saying I'm not the target audience for this movie (male, over 50). That said, maybe other adults won't waste 2 hours of their lives on this mind-numbing piece of drivel. Nothing but constant whining, sad atmosphere, sad music, characters with downcast eyes and stupid questions of ""why they're not together"". Believe me, the melodrama is stratospheric.I actually bought this BLU-ray version thinking it would have awesome special effects and great extras. I had no idea the games SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT was playing with its distribution practices. Since it seems Amazon got screwed by SUMMIT I've ended up with nothing. And no, I won't be hopping around to Wal-mart, Target, whatever, just to get all versions of the extras. Once is more than enough!"
2,Ugh.,"Maybe I would have enjoyed this better had I not read the books? I felt very disappointed at how many details were left out, the completely different look of the sets, the actors... I realize to have included more about each character, or relationship, would have taken more time than one movie would allow; I just felt like I was being told half a story. As ""popular"" as these books have become, step it up and get better direction/production.Kudos to Taylor Lautner for stepping into the actual look of ""Jacob"", though. Wouldn't hurt for Pattinson to do the same, considering his character in the book is so often described as ""perfect"".If you haven't read the books and think you might be interested, do yourself a favor and read them. I was a skeptic, thinking they were ""teen reading"", and really, really enjoyed them, and I'm old enough to be the Mom of the focus group. I would have loved to have been able to give this 5 stars. Sadly, I can't."
5,AWESOME!,"Yet again they have created another fascinating movie!! The suspense keep you completely in tuned with the show, I highly reccomend!!"
1,STUPID,ITS a bad stupid movie. This is a movie for a 10 year old girl. Glowing men and very bad acting.
4,New to the Twilight series.,"Being a Great Grandmother, I thought it would be wise of me to watch this series to keep up with the kids. I find the stories well written and the characters well defined. I can even today remember the intensity only a young woman can feel. Bella rocks."
3,"DVDs Perfect, Storyline Not-So-Much","The DVDs in this package are perfectly intact, shipped in thorough wrapping, and excellent quality for your purchases. The storyline, however, is not one I think the thoroughly literate or the avid writer would enjoy. Pop-culture hype and the diminished value in literary excellence in the world has permitted a poorly-constructed piece to stand where far better stories could. The saddest aspect of this story is easily that this could be superb, but falls short. However, if it's the item you're looking for, these DVDs will do the job easily enough -- personal opinion of the story unneeded. Happy shopping!"
4,MOVIE REVIEW,SEEMED OKAY. THE FIRST TWILIGHT MOVIE I HAVE SEEN AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO WATCHING THE REMAINING TWILIGHT MOVIES.
4,Confused but Happy.,When it first came in I was a little confused because t had a different language written in front along with the english title. I was like please tell me i didnt order a spanish version. I got home and tried it out and it was perfect. So overall i liked it but would of liked to know before hand what two disc edition it was.
5,It's incredible!,"I love it! And I got it from Amazon the same day I could've gotten it in the stores, for the same price or less. And I could've watched it earlier from a link they sent me (I didn't have the time, but I would've utilized that nice feature if I could've.) Overall, a wonderful product and a wonderful experience."
3,"Expecting more from all the hype, but it was good enough.",This was not as good as the first one. Hope the next one has more substance!
5,New Moon Awesome,New Moon was totally awesome. Edward looked so hot. Will buy Eclipse when it comes out.
4,"Not as good as twilight, but...","Ok, so this isn't even close to as good as Twilight, but you know you are going to see it anyway if you love the series. I also think that the actual book was not as strong as the Twilight one so I don't blame the film makers. The story line is a little anying regarding Bella feeling sorry for herself and not being kind to anyone trying to be nice to her. Makes you wonder why anyone really wants to be her friend in the first place. But, still love the films and the books. Just wish Bella's character was made a little more likable by the author.Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath"
5,twilight /newmoon,"a little dissappointed in the content of movie, but that is no fault of yours. Didn't know it was a love story sequal...thought it was a true action wolf and vampire movie....condition of product was great and at a decent price...no complaints!!thank you!"
3,I recommend,hi received the product today that gives me completely sealed guarantee that the product is new but his description was said that the Idoma Inglish with subtitles in Spanish and Inglish but when I read the product came with French subtitles only ...... send me something because I only speak Spanish so .....hola hoy recibi el producto totalmente sellado eso me da garantia que el producto es nuevo pero en su descripcion decia que el idoma era inglish con subtitulo en español e inglish pero cuando leo dicho producto vino solo con subtitulo en france...... porque me envia algo asi yo solo hablo español
4,;0),"Ok this one wasn't bad we got to see more of Jacob what he does and who he is not bad they still can improve on the acting though, but good to watch."
1,teenage version,I have now watched two of the Twilight series. I have not been impressed with either one of them. The story is predictable and dumbed down.If you have ever read various were and vamp novels then you know what I'm talking about. I'm thinking Patricia Briggs and Christine Feehan. These movies and probable their novels are too child like for most adult interest.For pre teens and teens I think the series is fine. And that's the audience best suited for these books and movies.
1,Am I over the age of 13???,"it's funny that Amazon asks if you are over the age of 13 to write this review.hopefully the only people that enjoyed this after school special (part 2) were 13 or younger.what an emotionless piece of garbage. I've never been so bored in a movie before.the thing is, you should NOT have to read the books to ""get"" the movie and ""like"" the movie. everyone I talk to about how much this series of movies is so ridiculous is like ""did you read the books?"". NO! ...and after seeing these train wrecks, I certainly don't plan on it!even though they are different, at least the Harry Potter movies could support themselves without reading the books.bottom line: The Twilight Saga is a disgrace to the entire Vampire genre. so disappointing."
3,True to the book -- for better or worse,"To those who have said that ""New Moon"" is short on action, I have to agree. The book that the movie is based on moves at a slow pace and is much more about character development than chills and thrills. For that reason, those wanting fight scenes, etc, should just skip ahead to ""Eclipse."" I personally enjoyed the movie, but I do think the pacing suffers at some parts which is why I've given it three stars."
1,meaning anywhere?,I'm told that some movies should not be judged on how they are sending the worst possible message to young girls. That it should be enjoyed as entertainment and as such shouldn't be criticized for being about as deep and meaningful as a Frisbee. Why does a movie have to serve to elevate the intellectual mind and leave you wanting to delve deeper into it's nuances? And I rest my case in why I this is a complete waste of time.
1,"still bad acting, but at least a better budget","Like I've said in my review for the Twilight DVD, I enjoy the books for what they are -- pure entertainment. I'm not expecting my life to be changed or anything. However, the acting continued to lack by the lead actors. Kristen can only do one emotion: blank stare. Pattinson doesn't fare quite as bad, but not much better. Taylor Lautner really stepped it up and I really felt for him (I honestly believe he has a bright future ahead). Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick as usual shined during the little screen time they had. Ashley Greene and Kellan Lutz did wonderful with what they were given, etc. The bright spots were Fanning and Sheen. Sheen was wonderfully creepy and scary. Don't pay full price for this. Wait until this is on the $1.00 theater screen or queue it on your Netflix or Blockbuster for when the DVD comes out & I'll do the same for whenever Eclipse comes out on DVD."
1,New Moon sucks,"This has got to be the most boring movie ever. I sat there and watched it all the way. I had to go out a couple of times to walk around and go bathroom and when I came back the scene is still the same. First of all, out of all the Twilight books, this one was the worst. The you make a long movie out of it, just did not make sense. Anyway, unless you are a die hard fan of this series, I recommend not getting it. I won't even recommend renting it. Don't waste your time."
3,Books are better but movie not bad,"I liked this movie better than Twilight but that being said the books are way better than both.The reason I liked it better than Twilight is less Edward.I can't stand Edward and did not miss him in this movie.Now if we could only have less Bella my watching (And reading) joy would be complete but I guess that is too much to ask.I actually liked the movie especially the parts with the Volturi especially Dakota Fanning as Jane.I am ordering it on DVD today.As to the reviewer who said Lautner doesn't look 25 get a life I thought he made a great Jacob, much better that Stewart as Bella (Or anything else she would play...Talk about wooden)but it is just a movie get over it."
2,Only worth making fun of for its badness,"This movie is so ridiculous that it's only worth watching with a group of friends who want to MST3K-it with you.The acting ranges from awful to nonexistent, the dialogue is forced and stilted, there is no real passion or chemistry among the leads, and it's hard to care what happens to any of them as a result.I give it one star for some of the music and another for the woodsy, if dreary, scenery."
2,Unbelievably boring for a vampire/werewolf movie,"Note: not sure why I gave it two stars. Should be one.I'm 42 minutes in, and it's been incredibly boring. Is this movie really for teens?Make that 45 minutes ... yawn.60 minutes ... yawn.I'm glad I'm watching this on DVD. I saved some serious time by fforwarding.OK, finally a few seconds of action ... then it's over.A guy climbs a tree.An unexciting and silly-looking werewolf fight. Yawn.73 minutes.At this point I must assume that I just don't understand what this movie is supposed to be. Maybe the other reviewers have read the book (is there a book?) and understand some deeper story and meaning underneath all this boredom and bad writing.A boring chase in the forest. The heroine does something really dumb. Yawn.More talking ... talking ... talking ... 92 minutes of mostly talking so far ...A short fight ... more talking ... talking ... talking ...Great, it's over. I've done it! Yawn."
3,50/50,"I cant say that New moon was better than Twilight, nothing in the second even touched the Baseball scene for its in your face wow factor. You actually see that Rosalie is capable of caring which is something you don't see in the beginning. The wolves really did not look that good. Edward was much better and Taylor uniquely wonderful, Kristin unfortunately still had to deal with a character that is pretty much totally strange and unappealing, sorry guys Bella is really weird. I cant blame the movie for the fact that there was not enough of the Cullens."
4,Guilty pleasure #2,"My wife had been hinting for a while that she really wanted to see the latest movie in the ""Twilight"" saga at the theater, but beyond the basic notion of it being about vampires I had no idea about the backstory. So, on to Amazon I went...and picked up all of the Blu-Ray releases thus far. I hate to admit it, but these movies are mesmerizing. The acting is just so-so, the story is a little convoluted and to top it all off the friggin vampires sparkle in the sunlight. All that being said, you really can't help being drawn into this world and these characters. The movies may lack a little when it comes to vampire lore, but the whole package somehow just works. The high-def transfers look really good, and my only complaint about the discs is that the dialogue always seems overpowered by the score, even when run through a home theater system."
3,Stick to the books,The books have much better detail and are a great story. The movies have weird acting and leave a lot of detail out.
2,Cases are in FRENCH!!!,"I love the movies, so I bought them all in Blu Ray. When they arrived from Amazon, two of them, New Moon and Eclipse, had French and English on the cases. The movie itself is in English, but the case shows in French. The image that you are seeing on the site is not what I actually got. However, the movie will play the same, so I might not be sending it back. I ordered from the American Amazon site, and I paid for it with American money, not Euros or whatever they use over in France. The price had a $ not a deformed E. So I do not understand why they would send me a French version of what I actually wanted. I am giving this 2 stars because the case is upsetting me."
1,I give up.,"Being a lover of all things vampire, I really WANT to like The Twilight Saga. Before seeing ""New Moon,"" I saw it as a chance for redemption, since the first film in this series was tolerable, yet slow and a bit shallow. But after seeing this film, I'm convinced that I should give up and move onto something new. This entire film could've been replaced by 130 minutes of Taylor Lautner running around with his shirt off, and I would've felt like I actually got my money's worth. At least the plot would be more interesting that way."
1,Another sad attempt,"How sad that the vampires have lost all their mystery and grace, and teenage love has lost it's intensity and angst. What happened to the passion and magic of the books? It's not here. Have to say this is the second epic fail in this series, so once again, buy the book. The first half of the movie is as spectacularly boring as the first film, the second half picks up some but only by adding action scenes that weren't in the book and leaving out others that would have been better and more interesting. Deviations from the story do nothing to add to the story or to the interest. Again, skip this movie it's stolen my happy memories and depth of the story presented in the book."
1,I got fooled...,"I have read some of the reviews, and maybe I am missing something but I only received 3 cds of nothing...no movie...nothing that the title implied...somebody let me know..because I am confused and disappointed...."
4,SWEET,"Pretty cool . Not your second rate film but what i consider first rate . I seen Canada mentioned , go figure ."
1,Not what I ordered!!,The Blu Ray I received for Twilight-New Moon was a Canadian copy. It has French and English on the packaging and it does not even have the right studio name. I haven't opened it to see if the audio is in English because I am planning on returning it.This was extremely disappointing. No where on the description did it say that it was even an option to receive a non-US copy.
5,The Twilight Saga: New Moon (Two-Disc Special Edition),Awsume move I would watch this time and time again I would recommend this to everyone This is a great movie
2,I don't like it,"I don't like it, but I ordered it for my daughter who liked it. So we averaged at around 2 stars. There you have it. I like my vampires with more grit and more blood."
3,finally had to,"i broke down and had to watch the series, since everyone else in the world already had. i'm 29 so if you're a teen i'm sure it's fine, but these movies somehow grab your attention and make you want to finish the story, but are cinematically pretty awful. lots of people raved about the effects and acting but actually it's pretty terrible. to be fair, taylor laudner (or whatever) is actually pretty good, he's the best one of the bunch. otherwise, snore."
3,Freezing Problems,"The digital playback froze a few times during really intense moments. I had seen the movie already, so it didn't matter much to me, but my husband was watching it for the first time and it was distracting to him. It even broke the suspense that the movie had been building and he made fun of those parts.Overall, the movie did a great job summarizing the book. Some changes had to be made for time's sake, but overall the story was still there. The acting has improved a lot in this movie compared to the first and you can tell that had a bigger budget on this one."
5,I love this movie,"I have watched Twilight, Twilight New Moon, and Twilight Ecilipse several times I love the three of them. They are really well written books and the movies are really great ."
5,The quality of the picture is great!,I really like the fact that I can take my Kindle everywhere and watch movies whenever some downtime happens in my life. I am a Twilight fan and so loved this movie. The quality of the picture is great. The sound quality is excellent as well.
5,Love this movie!,I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves vampires! All of the Twilight series movies are great! Get it today!
1,Waste of money,"The animations look completely fake, the book is way better than the movie I feel like this was worst than the first movie. I didn't like how this movie was directed ,it looks like every screen had a green scene behind and I'm pretty sure that most of the movie did."
5,good,"just love all the twilight movies. 5 stars . would recommend it to anyone who loves the books, vampires, etc."
3,i'm a twi-junkie,"I love all the twilight films, as corny as they are. None live up to the first, but after reading the books, I had to watch all the films."
3,good,It was good but I didn't think it was as good as the first. I am excited to see the others though.
5,Favorite Movie Ever,THis is a great movie - has become my favorite. I got the 2 disc special - well worth it!
4,It's alright,"There was some parts that I found very enjoyable, but sometimes there was weird pauses between Edward and Bella."
3,few scratches,got the dvd earlier than expected which was great. it did have a few scratches so the quality of the actual dvd was not that great. but better than expected for a used dvd
3,good movie,"This movie was by far SO much better than Twilight, how it was done and all the effects. I was actually impressed wish that he would have the last one because that one stunk! They did make it less sad and upset than it was in the book which was good because reading the book was really depressing. I'm upset because this dvd set does NOT have any extras. For those of you whom like commentary, this has it but I HATE that. I prefer to just watch the movie, why hear people talk about it? LAME!I actually didn't buy this from Amazon, I used my points to get it from another site but they sent it through amazon's site. But I am glad that I didn't waste my $ on it, because I would have been pretty pissed if they I had."
3,Good Movie - CRAP for $20.00,"I only have 1 thing to say, which is what everyone else is saying...You get the movie!! THAT'S IT!! If you want any extras, pay for them either through buying multiple copies from multiple retailers, or pay apple a grundle. I bought Harry Potter over christmas and just bought the Blind Side along with this. I paid 18.00 for Potter and 22.00 for Blind Side. I got digital copy, all the bonus features I could dream of and a DVD version of the movie. I am less than 1 mistake away from never buying a Summit Product again!! I would urge people not to buy this until Summit gets their crap together!!!"
5,Loved it!,"Great movie...not so much a fan of the main actress, but still a good movie. It goes along pretty well with the book."
3,the twilight saga: new moon,"the movie itself was good, but it did not keep with the book as much as was expected."
4,Twilight Saga,my Daughter Loves these movies it was a gift for easter and when she saw it in he basket nothing else mattered she has watched it about 30 times since then it was a good movie a great movie if you have a pre-teen or a teen daughter.
1,Really horrible movie,"Just terrible. About two steps above un-watchable. If I could refund the purchase, I would. Unfortunately, I don't think that is an option."
1,Don't waste your time...,"The quality of the movie was awful and was extremely pixilated. You can't download the movie onto your hard drive which requires immense searching in order to be notified by amazon of such. I bought the movie off iTunes, quality of the movie was 10X better and is yours anywhere you go, even with out Internet connection!"
3,tough it out.,"Although it doesn't stand up as a singular movie, it does however compliment well to the Twilight Saga. It's the turning point between Bella, Edward, and Jacob which defines where the movie will be headed onwards when considering these three characters."
5,Twilight-New Moon,"Excellent book. Book #2 in the series. Very good story line, characters were spot on. I recommend reading the series before watching the movies. While the movie does a very good job of following the book, there are things you pick up on that are not always fully explained in the movie. Highly recommend entire series"
3,bad acting in this movie.,I was so excited when the movie came out because I read the book and really enjoyed it. Well I was definitely disappointed when I watched the movie. It wasn't what other people make it out to be and I thought it had some bad acting in this movie.
5,cool,my girlfriend loves twilight so it made a great gift for christmas. thank you for putting a smile on her face.
5,Cute brown metal case for the New Moon Blu Ray dvd.,This brown case is just like the picture. It is metal and really protects the movie. Never again will I have to worry about someone dropping and cracking my movie case. Love it.
1,Can i have 2 hours of my life back?,"My brothers wife got me to watch another Twilight movie. I will not be watching 3 and 4. NO WAY A GUY COULD LIKE THIS MOVIE. Its so obvious its a girl movie when it first shows Edward hes walking in slow motion. Are you F***ing kidding me slow mo to introduce a character. Acting still is terrible. Mostly just talking, not much happening. Jacob turned into a werewolf, thats about the only developed plot there was. Oh and that Black vampire got killed by wolves. Bella's screams of agony when shes depressed are unintentionally hilarious. Like alot of the movie its really funny but for the wrong reasons. I can only imagine her acting when she has sex with Edward in the 4th movie. I could of not watched the last 30 min and not cared about how it ended. My sister in law says she loves the books so its almost like she forces herself to endure and like the movies too."
2,Still don't understand why this is so popular,"Well, wasted my money buying this but since I had the first I figured surely the sequel couldn't be any worse. Boring. Have to admit the books are much better. These movies just cannot hold my attention. They are very slow paced. I don't even get any 'romantic' story in this. All I can figure out is people like these movies for the actors or actresses. I wouldn't recommend this. The werewolves are not werewolves at all. Just large wolves. Very disappointed in this film. I don't hate it but it's definitely on the bottom of any movie watching list I have."
1,deleted scenes,"I was looking for the deleted scenes, but found out they are not on the version from Amazon. I am greatly disappointed. I order the 2-disc editions because 99% of them have always had the deleted scenes.I will be shopping around for Eclipse. I may not use Amazon for anything but books now."
1,"Oh, God, I want to slit my throat!",How can anyone make a movie about vampires and werewolves and make it so boring???????
2,Sparkly Vampires Vs. Masculine Werewolves!!!,"For the past two years, I've avoided the Twilight saga like the plague because it just looked so melodramatic and ruined the image of scary vampires like Dracula. Instead, we get a Glampire, buff Werewolves, and a whiny teen named Bella who is suicidal over them. There was a double feature at my theater last week, so I finally decided to cave in and watch. Bella is just ridiculous. After she gets a paper cut at her birthday party, Jasper Cullen tries to attack her. The Cullens soon decide to leave Forks, and Bella goes into a deep depression. Whenever she gets an adrenaline fix, she can see glimpses of Edward. If you love glampires and melodramatic love stories, I'm sure you'll love NEW MOON!!!"
5,Love New Moon,"Amazon is great when it comes for any purchases, Now the movie ""New Moon"" is a great movie and I love all the Saga books....But this new director changed what Katherine did in the first movie, but making the movie way too dark in a lot of the scenes, I almost returned my copy of ""New Moon"" back to Amazon for a new copy but when I played it on another DVD player then it was ok. and as far as to what Katherine did she kept the cullens ""Innocent"" like (and don't get me wrong)I know Vampires are not nice... but the new director makes them look all weird and falsie looking. Should have just kept them all looking the same as the first movie.Yeah I'm an old lady what do I know...Twilight lover"
5,*****************,I really love this movie .......it came so fast .......GREAT service thank you again:)
3,love twilight good price,"Wanted to get teh second Twilight. Recently bought a new Blu ray so I wanted to get a blu Ray disc. I love the movie. I am most disappointed that no matter where I looked they did not make a combo Pack. I would to be able to watch this in my bedroom but I can't since its a DVD player. Most new movies have the combo pack option. I am not going to buy the DVD as well!Otherwise I love the movie. It is a great sequal to the first one. Not a mans movie, defently more of a chick movie. My husband fell asleep and only woke up for the few fight scenes. But thats okay its my movie not his :)"
5,TwiMom all the way,"I love this movie, so naturally, my concern was the condition that it would be in since it was used, but wow! It was like new and it was delivered to me about 2 days after ordering. I am very happy!"
1,Amazingly awful,"I enjoyed the first ""Twilight"" film, and looked forward to the seeing where the story would go. But I never imagined they would wind up with such a poorly plotted, slow-moving, incoherent mess, or that they would so shamelessly push the teen-heartthrob angle at the expense of trying to actually tell a good story. This was just awful. And the actor that plays her second love interest, the werewolf kid, is so intensely unattractive -- why, why, why, oh why do we have to keep watching him take his shirt off and try and look all sexy? Yuchh. Anyway, this movie was a real embarrassment. If this is the direction their headed in, I'd be amazed if they could pull it together again for the third film. Or if anyone still cared."
3,Thank goodness for Taylor Lauttner,"Honestly, I would have dropped double the money to see his bare-chested distinction parade around on screen. Unfortunately, I had to endure the two hours of cinematic drivel for the pleasure. Although I am not a member of the pubescent target audience, I now have a better understanding of their plight if THIS is what is being funneled into their impressionable minds."
2,dvd version skipped,I got the dvd version of new moon from wal-mart and about every 20 mins it would skip over a part of the movie and each time it skipped it was a good 10 to 15 mins of the moive. The movie skipped in 4 different times in the movie. I took it back to wal-mart and they told me at least 20 other people had the same problem. They gave me a new copy of the dvd and it also has the same problem. DO NOT BUY THE DVD VERSION. Unless u dont care if u miss parts of the movie.
2,"Eh, It was okay","Maybe it's just because I didn't read the book, but I thought this movie dragged on and was very boring. But, the special effects seemed cool."
1,Zero Stars,"I can't believe how bad this movie was. I walked out after 45 minutes because the acting was so lame and the plot so ridiculous. It's a shame that young women and girls go to movies like this and end up thinking that this is the best that the movies can offer.If they want to watch romance and/or vampire films, there are so many more examples that are of better quality, and I sure hope they don't think that love is in any way like the rellationships they see here. The books have to be better than this, at least I hope so."
4,Wish there were more disc purchasing options,"LOVE LOVE LOVE the movie. However, I realize that certain stores (e.g. Target, Wal-Mart, etc.) may have certain exclusive rights for packaging/content.I wish Amazon could have the same options. I would have loved to have the option to purchase the documentary on the Forks or the two-disc special edition with Eclipse bonus material.""New Moon"" was delivered on time and as promised!"
5,Just a few words to say,I just want to say that this movie was way better than Twilight!! 5 stars to New Moon!! Can't wait to see Eclipse!
2,New Moon,"The best actor for the teen set is Taylor. However, Sheen steals the movie, whenever he is on screen you forget everything else. Too bad the lovers are such zombies."
1,Blu Ray disc did not work!!,"I pre-ordered this Blu Ray back in January. After waiting 3 months til it came out I was very anxious to watch it, but when I put the disc in my Blu Ray player it would stop at 17 seconds and not play a single thing. I had not used my Blu Ray player in awhile so I began to think maybe it was broken, so I went and bought another movie on Blu Ray and it worked just fine. So I called Amazon and they ended up sending me a second New Moon Blu Ray and it did the same thing! I was very frustrated at that point and called Amazon again and they ended up giving me a refund and temporarily removed the item from their site. All in all Amazon's customer service was very helpful, but it was very frustrating to receive two defective items. I ended up purchasing the DVD version from a local store instead."
4,Won't pre-order next time...,"Of course I love the movie, but I was disappointed that I did not receive my copy on the release date. I would have NOT have pre-ordered fro mAmazon had I known I wouldn't get it by the release date. I know some people did get theirs even before the release date, but not me...next time I will buy Eclipse from Target or Walmart on release day."
3,It was ok but I just had to keep watching....,"I read all the books in record breaking time and I'm an adult. The 1st movie was like, ""I loved the books, so I can't not watch the movie...to the end."" Pretty much the same thought process with New Moon. I actually liked the beginning, fast forwarded through most of the middle, seriously, and the end was good enough that I want to see the next one. My one complaint, ok, actually two, Bella, Kristen Stewart is NOT a good actress. So bad, I think, that she pulls the movie down. And tweens, don't get all up in arms, but the boy that plays Jacob, not so good either. Plus, he doesn't quite fit the ""manly"" werewolf role. But, all in all, 3 outta 5 stars."
2,Pretty bad...,"I have not read the books, so I'm not sure if the translation to screen did it justice, but not this movie was more disappointing over Twilight. I saw reviews that New Moon was better (which is why I watched it), but Kristen Stewart is still horrible-- she looks as if she had a hard time remembering her lines with her constant stammering of words in every direction. I honestly think her only role was to look pretty. It was difficult to watch this movie. Lautner and Pattinson acted better, but the overall film was weak and boring. I gave this 2 stars because at least there is some slight entertainment value in waiting to see if Eclipse will redeem this one."
5,Great,Very pleased with purchase of this movie. Clear picture and able to play it even on my computer and with my son's XBOX.
5,dvd,I got this dvd to replace the one that I already have. It was a poor quality one. I do like this dvd. It is a must for all of the twilight fans out there.
3,half spanish half english,Even tho the movie is in english...everything written is half english and half spanish...urg Deceiving pictures. I purchased the third movie of the series as well and its also the same way...half spanish and half english
3,Good,"Not much action, the film focuses more on how Bella takes the fact that Edward is gone, no big deal."
2,Necessary but disappointing,"I've seen the first three movies in this saga, and this is my least favorite. If I hadn't read the book, I think I would have been completely lost. There was a lot of back story that wasn't addressed in the film, and the movie seemed disjointed. It is necessary to watch it to stay in the loop in the saga, but could have been made much better."
2,Not Happy,I ordered and paid for a new DVD and received a poorly mailed USED copy. I expected more from a company with 100% approval rating.
1,Dull as dishwater .........,"Having enjoyed the first film I was really looking forward to the sequel. I was incredibly disappointed to say the least, so much so that I even resent giving it a one star rating! The plot was weak/ non-existant and really just boring. When Edward Cullen says something about ""let's wait five more years"" I was thinking ""OH hell, 5 more sequels in order to outdo the Harry Potter franchise, so we can all get fabulously rich selling our tat to kids!"". This film was all about dreary teen angst and dreamy boys getting their shirts off and acting heroically for girls - which is fine in its place, but not for me or anyone much over the of 20 I suspect. I hear the next in the series is even worse!"
3,Music and Special Effects,"I think the music and special effects in this movie were really good. Compared to Twilight, this movie was at least a decent watch. The wolves, music and shirtless men were probably one of the best aspects of the film in my opinion. The acting was also a lot better in this film than Twilight.The plot of this movie really followed the book quite well. I'm not exactly a fan of the book series, but New Moon was the best out of the whole series."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I'm 45 minutes into this film and can't think of any good reason to finish watching it. There is NO STORY. Belle is pining for Edward and fixing a motorcycle. Wow, I'm on the edge of my seat. I've never been able to see what the young ladies see in Robert Pattinson, and this makes me wonder even more. But to each his (or in this case, her) own. The only thing keeping me in suspense is when does Taylor Lautner cut his hair? If you're a fan of the series or fan because all your other friends are gaga for this series, then watch it, otherwise, catch up on any missed episodes of Buffy. She's far more entertaining."
2,Rent this for a laugh,"The notions are juvenile and obviously aims at appeasing teenage girls only, while there is nothing to help boost their intellectual calibre. Of course, it is good for a laugh because the actors are so serious in it!"
4,Twilight Sage - New Moon,Got the item just in time for Christmas - my daughter loves the series and is looking forward to playing the DVD's.
5,Gears game is lots of fun!,"This gears game is not only colorful and lots of fun, it offers great fine motor skill practice. My son is 5 and he enjoys building and creating with it though he does like some guidance with figuring out the 3 dimensional aspects of building a really large structure out of this. I think for a child who is younger, the parts would get lost and scattered all over the house really easily. I think it's better for age 4+ as a table game that you get out and not a game that you keep down on the floor all the time. And when you keep it up and just get it down occasionally, it seems more exciting to the kids too!"
2,OUCH,"The bottom green pieces are EXTREMELY hard to get snapped, and little fingers got pinched. I can see with an adult how this could potentially be fun, but I couldnt leave my son to do a whole lot with it alone. It got sent back."
3,hard!,"I gave this three stars for fun because, while it is dynamic in action and engaging, it is difficult to put together. Not only is it hard for me (an adult woman) to figure out how to make it work, but my husband found it very hard to pull the pieces apart (and he recently got 99/100 on his military physical training test!). I give this a four for educational value because it does a good job at teaching how things work. I'm giving it a four for durability because it seems well built, but I haven't tested it for long. Overall, I give this toy a three because it is difficult to work with, but okay overall."
2,not all it is cracked up to be.,"The gears don't fit well together, it is hard to make anything semi-complicated. Many of the pieces are difficult to put together and take apart. Overall, it will get played with, but not much and with much help from the parents."
4,Fun! Fun! Fun!,Our kids love it but just having this set seems too repetitive for them so they stopped playing with it after a few days. I'm thinking of getting a different set to get them interested again.
5,Kids love it,My kids (ages 7 and 3) love this toy. It sparks their creative sides and they love showing me their lastest creations. I would recommend this toy to others.
2,Not as impressive is it could be.,"Sadly, the motor of the gear does not connect well to the set up. The connection locks up constantly. I had to drill the holes larger and add glue and thumb tacks to get the gears to stay put. Many of the fancy gears don't serve any connection feature. Its just decoration. They need to fix the toy so it stops locking up."
5,lotsa gears,"I like this set a lot --- it is even challenging for the adults who are playing with children --- this is a good thing! And, I like that you can put it away in the case it comes in --- also a good thing!"
4,Unique,"This is a very unique gift. Our boys love to build with blocks, wooden tracks, and play with Legos. It has been an interesting additon to the building toys. They did need to have some adult help to fully understand how gears work, but are able to manage just fine now (ages 6,5,and 2)."
3,Gears,"This was a really nice set, although my 6 year old grandson was not as interested in it as my kindergarteners are. So, nothing wrong, just not the right choice."
5,gears,"Bought for my grandson, and he loves them. Also there is a large bucket and he can pick them up himself."
5,He loved it,Would highly recommend for young kids. My son's 4 years old and is having a blast with this toy. Definitely worth the investment. I really can't think of any dislikes on this one. Gives him lots of stimulation.
3,Great toy with some durability problems,"Gears are a great toy, and my child loves to construct things daily. I really, really think Gears are a wonderful toy. Don't get me wrong.After about a year, however, I can report that there *are* durability issues with the blue connectors. On the connectors, the little plastic prongs to which gears snap on/attach are weak, and you can see the stress points forming as white lines. The prong loses its shape and strength, then the gears start to fall off. I mean, fall off ALL the time. This has led to much frustration. Some of the prongs broke off long ago. I have to replace our whole bucket now because the gears won't stay on the connectors.I also have to say that the gears have chipped as well."
1,Where's her Accordion?,"I was very disappointed with this recording. I am a big accordion fan but barring a few tracks, could barely hear her playing at all."
2,On site image does not match figure,I'm a tad dissapointed to find that the open mouth full of teeth shown on the web site is not what the Tooth Fairy has in its reality. The figure actually has a closed mouth and appears somewhat demur. Not the sort of horror figure I expected.
5,Wonderful candle,"I got the lavender one for a gift and it makes my whole place (granted it is small) smell fantastic. The scent isn't overpowering or cheap smelling, and it lasts for a long time after you blow the candle out. I light mine every evening after work for a couple of hours and enjoy the aromatherapy until I go to bed. These candles are expensive but they last a long time because you don't have to burn them for very long at a time. I haven't tried the other scents but I did smell the Italian Blood Orange at a local spa and it was nice."
5,Excellent manual,"This book includes basic and advanced information regarding proper techniques for forensic interviews and interrogations. After using the techniques/information presented in this text and others, I have never had one of my interviews or interrogations ruled inadmissible in criminal court during 19 years of police work."
1,This Kindle Version,"The book itself is a magnificent work. This Kindle Version has only the months in the TOC and no text after that. Unless Amazon corrects it, it's not worth the download time."
4,Butch and Sundance should have had this guidebook,"Bolivia is a spectacular and seldom visited country and a guidebook is very helpful. This book offers lots of maps and travel recommendations, along with medical advice, history, customs, and the very popular ""how to get there and away"". Bolivia is not changing very rapidly, so the information tends to be quite reliable. The biggest problem with popular guidebooks is that many people read them, and the recommended hotels tend to be very crowded. I usually travel with one, and I think that this one is the best. But I always ask other travelers where they have stayed and what they have seen, and many of my best experiences have been because of word of mouth. A mixture of guidebook and going it on your own can be a very fun and adventurous way to travel, but keep the Lonely Planet handy.Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"
5,The Essential Guide to Bolivia,"I have used a ton of different guidebooks in my travels, but I always come back to Lonely Planet. That is the one I always have packed with me when I go.This is the essential guidebook for all who are travelling to Bolivia. I used the Lonely Planet Guidebook for Bolivia when I went a few years ago and I just bought this one since I am planning a trip to Bolivia next summer. Lonely Planet has never let me down."
1,worse lonely planet ever,"got the book to prepare for a trip to the bolivian pantanal, in the peurto suarez area...neither are even mentionned in the book, not even in the index!!! never seen anything like this...wish i could get a refund!!"
1,One of the worst guidebooks I have used,There are serious flaws with this edition of Lonely Planet Bolivia. The map of Sucre is unusable as the key and points on the street plan don't match up. Other travellers have told me that other street plans in the book have similar problems.At other times the information is incorrect or badly researched.To those thinking of travelling in Bolivia I would seriously recommend using another guidebook.
1,"A poor reference guide, idealistic at best.","The author's view is too idealistic; readers and future visitors considering on touring through the country must take into account the enormous amount of hatred among the natives towards northamericans, stemming from the popular movements from one Evo Morales. Author also ignores the lack of common courtesy among shop owners and the dangers posed by walking after nine PM on the streets, which are taken over by gangs of what are known as Pollillas - translated into ""Moths"".The cultural life is hardly taken into account, as it is virtually nonexistent. The greatest parts of visiting Bolivia are all OUTSIDE the cities, yet the author tries to gloss over the fact of the stagnant urban scene, to convince it as a viable tourist option. Totally unreliable view."
2,I'm not convinced that the authors have ever been to Bolivia,"Lonely Planet is generally a great source for guidebooks, but I'm not convinced the authors returned to Bolivia to do research for this updated edition. It seems as if they just slapped on a new cover and republished the previous edition.The restaurant recommendations (if the restaurant recommended is even still open for business, that is) lean heavily on pizza and pasta places that cater to travelers, which is fine if you have traveled all the way to Bolivia to eat pizza with a bunch of German tourists in zip-off hiking pants, but not useful at all if you want an authentic experience.I also had a Rough Guide to Bolivia during my 5-week trip around Bolivia and found that book to be a far superior resource to LP Bolivia. The Rough Guide never disappointed in terms of hotel, restaurant, and sight seeing recommendations."
3,Guess I have a bone to pick...,"I guess I have a bone to pick with this title, as I'm the author of at least 90% of the background information; I wrote the first four editions of this book, but failed to receive any author credit this time around. However, the newly inserted practical information seems to be solid, despite the fact that the new updater(s) lacked much time to put it together and Lonely Planet's new format dictated the deletion of lots of information that I'd consider both useful and entertaining - and in some cases essential. I'm sorry to see what has happened to 'my baby' (this was the first book I wrote for Lonely Planet), but that's through no fault of the current updater(s). In fact, I believe it's still the best available guide to Bolivia. Happy travels in that wonderfully enigmatic country!"
5,Food and festivals,A great overview of the country and certainly an essential companion to any trip to this underrated country. Food and festival entries are particularly good and help in any trip planning. Always impressed with the quality of LP publications and the recommendations were good.
1,Worst Lonely Planet guide I have ever had,"The guide is seriously outdated. I bought a version that the website claims to be published on December 2012. For example, how can a guide miss an airport in Uyuni (one of the most important destinations in Bolivia)? The airport was built two years ago!!!!!Travel times, travel routes, companies and so on are not accurate any more. The guide is still useful for a general idea of where to go and what do to but it is not reliable for making decisions.On a more specific and personal level, I think this is the last guide I buy for kindle. It is really difficult to navigate and maps are just impossible to use.One ends up wasting a lot of time trying to find stuff and in the process one misses some important bits of information.Summary: Look for another guide if you plan to travel to Bolivia or use this one knowing that for getting around it is not accurate and you'll have to find travel specifics from somewhere else."
3,Very incomplete and not updated,"Itinenaries, rates, available hotels, activities are not updated.Also, viewing the maps in kindle was impossible.Bolivia's guide was not good. Viewing it in the Kindle made it even worse."
5,Great Lakes Lighthouse Encyclopedia,"We have 50 lighthouse books in our home, and this book rates in the top three. The information and photography contained within are all a lighthouse buff could ask for."
4,The Opera is Fabulous.,"I recently saw the Opera in Detroit, Michigan. It was a wonderful experience (but isn't going to the opera always a wonderful experience?). I thought it was well done-- the music was a tad too 20-th Century for my tastes, but I still loved it!"
5,Isa Lei,The merging of the Fijian song Isa Lei into a deeply moving piece of sub-continental music is brilliant. Worth the whole CD
4,Good book marred by shaky set-up,"I liked Dinty Moore's examination of Buddhism in America. I thought his explanations of esoteric Buddhist concepts were clear and straightforward, his observations rich with the detail of day-to-day life. The small tome is a superficial--at best--look at this ancient religion, but an honest one. Too bad Moore clings to what he calls his ""Project Mind""--the premise that he's on an anthroplogical mission (to find out what American Buddhism is and why it appeals to us) rather than a spiritual one. Clearly, Moore is seeking more than ""data"" on his journey; his chats with spiritual leaders are about much more than ""good quote."" I for one would have related far better to Moore's journalistic journey had he dispensed with the pretense and gotten down to the sticky, messy, uncomfortable business of enlightenment."
5,"Insightful, Funny, REAL...","OK. I have just begun to read this book and I have to say that it is probably one of the best books I have read (next to the Harry Potter series) in a long time. I could NOT put it down! The wording and the experiences the author describes are so to the point and real.Thanks to Dinty Moore, I now have a better understanding of Dharma and how the East has met West and merged seamlessly."
3,Not bad- a mirror of Buddhism in America,"which is also ""not bad."" However, the book's schizoid nature- which the trade reviews have noted, *is* there, and in part is a reflection of Buddhism in America.America has not yet seen its Hui Neng, or Shantideva, or Eiehei Dogen, although we have had the Shakers.Truly American Buddhism doesn't exist yet - although not for want of trying by the likes of Loori et al., and this leads to my main criticism of the book: the author doesn't quite get *how* lacking America is in its Buddhist development because he relies too much on folks like Helen Tworklow, and not enough on his South Asian Theravada teacher, IMO- who, by his immigrant status, provides a good example of what American Buddhism at present is not. Asia's been doing this far longer than Americans, and if you've been there, you know. Not only the ""strength of practice,"" but also the inevitable frankness about Dharma scam artists.Still, a good introductory book, and yes, it is quite humorous."
4,Not So Accidental,"There are at least two problems with the title of this book. First, it gives away the fact that the writer considers himself Buddhist. No suspense there. Second, there was no ""accident"" involved, but rather the purposeful quest of a person investigating various forms of Buddhism. Oddly, the title is the only thing I have to complain about! The personal account given in this work is well-written and engrossing. If you are curious about Buddhism, this should be on your weekend reading list."
4,...entertaining entry to American spin on Zen,"Noble and interesting attempt to bring the search and discovery of the many westernized versions of Zen in a coast-to-coast america. More importantly, an example of the writer seeking through prose to reach his inner, unspoken mantra. Only needed to hear the grounding of his feet in the Zen's focus of experience as existence. Well worth the price, time, and effort by any reader."
3,Stewing About Zen,"As a perpetual plodder on the spiritual path, I'm always buying some book or another that promises to simplify religion -- maybe so that I can feel empowered by newfound knowledge or, at the very least, emboldened by my own intellectual standing relative to the author.The author of *this* particular volume is one Dinty W. Moore, a beefy, would-be Buddhist and creative writing professor whose singular mission is to catalog the evolving essence of American Buddhism.Rife with anecdotes from his experiences at retreats of all stripes, an Indiana appearance by Tibet's beatific Dalai Lama, and several face-to-face encounters with ""real American Buddhists,"" Moore manages to create for the reader an entertaining, enlightening (small ""e"") vantage point from which to witness his slow shuffle towards Shakyamuni (the Buddha).The result is a book that is light enough for an airplane, but deep enough for the bathtub. Recommended."
5,American Buddhism,"Moore's autobiographical narrative is an excellent overview of American Buddhism practices. His explanations of the dharma are accessible and easily understood. I personally found his experiences at various retreats good preparation for my first retreat. Highly recommend this light read as an intro to Buddhism. If readers are looking for more meaty books, try Jack Kornfield, Pema Chodron, and Chogyam Trungpa."
5,top rated,Very good album. Being more likely a guitar listener I must saythat I rarely find a player excites me as Mr. Herring with histalented playing . But the album apart from the guitar thing isindeed a very good album and there is no bad song in this work.
3,It's Just Super Glue,I frankly thought it was a larger amount of glue to the the cost. About half the price at Walmart
4,Should I?,"I hesitate to write this review because I'd rather buy every one that comes available. At John Lopez Welding School we are always buying grinders. Of all of our grinders in use (with some students, abuse) over half are 1810PSD's. They seem to hold up much longer than similar models and the students can handle them easily. Until something better comes along, we will continue replacing or beyond-repair grinders with these."
5,The best,"If you're in the market for a quality angle grinder, consider the bosch product. For the price and if you want a grinder with a paddle switch this is a great product."
1,Don't do it!,"This drill is a waste of money, picked it up approx. 1 year ago at a costco for around $39, seemed like a good deal, came with two batteries and a charger. I believe this drill is made by Alltrade, with a kawasaki label. This tool has been used little and is pathetic,batteries, both of them last a very short time, clutch is already slipping, my 14 y/o 9.6v Makita has seen much battle and still performs far superior to this tool. I have recently switched to using Ryobi and the one + system, which I have been very happy with, you can interchange the 18V batteries Ni Cd or lithium with any tools in the 18V range. Just completed a 700 sq ft deck project using the Ryobi impact driver, absolutely brilliant tool, tons of power and with 2 batteries, never had down time. Bottom line, do not waste your money, Ryobi is not a high end, maybe a little more, but far superior to this piece of junk."
2,Runs out of power quickly,If I had known this drill was going to die so quickly I would have never bought it. Ok for very small jobs but don't expect it to maintain power long enough to even install a shelf
3,"Fun teletubbies but annoying ""real people.""","My toddler liked the Teletubbies scenes in this video (a scene at the beginning involving each of the Teletubbies going through a big door was a total hit with him -- and I imagine that it would be with most toddlers who are obsessed with doors). But the ""real people"" videos on this tape are not so great. The first one involves kids looking for rabbits and is just kind of boring. The second one involves an adult woman dressed up like a queen and putting on a show for some kids. It's painful to watch and to listen to."
3,Remember the source!,"The sound is amazingly good on this black and white DVD of an over forty years-distant TV broadcast of Berlioz's enduring piece. However, beware of coughs, and of cuts in the material. I bought this primarily for ""The Shepard's Farewell"" and was chagrinned to hear it shortened by one verse! I can't wait to find out what else didn't make the cut for time."
3,One of Rev. Jim Jones favorites.,"I liked ""Wanna do it to you"", ""Chalk it up"", and another of which I can't find the title. I never heard of this singer before until I started listening to the FBI Jonestown tapes and low and behold it was in there. Evidently, Rev. Jim Jones had this in his possession!"
4,A musical jouney to home,"Lots of music components, while watching the DVD, I feel touched by the music in the background. I am also touched by the plot which is two 'strangers' in France tried to journey back to Algeria to find their ancestors' root. A very god movie of Tony Gatlif. Exiles promises a definition for why people feel empty sometimes. Worth watching over and over again."
2,Falls short,"Despite high expectations, none of Gatlif's efforts have met or surpassed his hallmark film Latcho Drom. Exiles is particularly disappointing with its thin plot that links occasional emotional high spots and some interesting gypsy music sequences. The highlights are not enough to compensate for its lack of depth and texture."
5,Aimee...I will never stop listening...,"There are just a handful of recordings that I listen to faithfully YEARS after their release. These songs are timeless. They are beautiful. They are Delicious. This album will never grow old...and I will never stop listening. Thank you so much, Aimee...for sharing your incredible gift."
5,Wore out the audio tape! Buying the CD!,"This album is very easy to like. The lead singer's voice doesn't become stale and neither do the arrangements. One thing that stands out are the wonderful and creative lyrics. I'd recommend that when you listen to this album for the first time, choose a sunny late morning relaxing Saturday (on your day off) get the morning newspaper, favorite coffee and listen. Put yourself in the lyrics and dream."
5,My divorce album,"This tape got me through my divorce years ago. I wore it out and when I got a new one my friend lifted it. So, now I'm back and it's still great."
5,A heart wrenching masterpiece!,"Everything's Different Now guided me through lost loves during the late 80's and early 90's only to resurface some months ago as I flipped through my CD collection. To my pleasant surprise, all the power and emotion is still there even with the lack of personal crisis. My vote for album of the 80's!"
3,Last hurrah for the Snow Queen & Band,"The title's more or less accurate: for the final record in their trilogy of albums, 'Til Tuesday moved away from the general pop sound of their previous pieces and toward a more ""mature"" sound. The lyrics are mediocre enough, but the music is where the strength lies: the arrangements are pretty to the point where they almost lulled me into divine tranquility; the fact that they never escape their Eighties pop-rock trap only increases their appeal. But their downfall, beside the deathly uninspired lyrics, is Mann, who sounds like the stereotypical Ice Queen, unmoving from her bitter throne and devoid of any desire to be dethroned. When she sings ""Nobody wants to be happier more than me/Nobody wants to be happier more than I do,"" my B.S. detector goes off the scale. And I LIKE Aimee Mann! The one brilliant/non-mediocre lyric: ""I was counting to forever/And never even got to ten."""
4,One of the most compelling pop albums ever,"Aimee Mann is lanky, pale, and has floppy doll-like hair. She looks slightly boyish. This image, combined with her voice, which though intended to sound happy over the happy poppy music, has a sadness and vulnerability that makes her all the more compelling. There is a honesty and purity in her voice which you do not find with many singers. Most of the song on this album are about a broken relationship ( perhaps with Jules Shear). The lyrics are poignant. The songs are not so much like water the way Sarah M's song are. Rather, they are very well crafted pop songs. What makes the album so compelling is the way she delivers them. One of the best pop records ever recorded!"
2,Should have passed this one by,"I bought this book while visiting the Yorkshire Dales, after lapping up the James Herriot series years earlier. I was sooo excited to find the book and had romantic visions of reading about the real James Herriot while visiting his homeland.Ohhhhh, how I wish I had picked up the book, soaked up the photos, and put the book right back on the shelf.A classic case of raining on my parade; bursting my bubble; toss out ANY fitting cliche. It shattered all my illusions about James Harriet's life, experiences, and loved ones. If you are a sentimental fool like me and have read Herriot's books, pass this one byyyyy."
2,Very Disappointed with this Book,"I bought this book after having read and re-read all the Herriot books for the past twenty years. I was eagerly looking forward to seeing pictures of a young James Herriot, a young 'Siegfried' et al. We fans already knew that the characters names were pseudonyms but did Lord really have to go to so many lengths in almost calling James Herriot a liar ? Why did he feel it so important to reveal so much ? I felt he and Eddie Straiton collaborated in trying to destroy what James Herriot had spent so many years building - a little corner of the world where we can all escape to in our hearts and minds. I wonder how many people will ever be able to enjoy re-reading James Herriots books again after reading this unnecessary 'expose'. Shame on you Graham Lord !"
2,This book has the wrong sub-title,"I agree with most of the opinions expressed in other reviews - Lord seems to be determined to highlight the inconsistencies in Herriot/Wight's life. Even though it's a well documented and well written book, I really wonder about Lord's motivation for writing it.One comment I haven't read so far, though, is that the book should be sub-titled ""The Life of a Writer"". Fully 1/2 of the book discusses his work as a writer - how he got started, how he got published, how he handled fame, etc. That was interesting, but - after reading 4 of Herriot's books - what I really wanted to know was what his daily life as a vet was like (what the sub-title implies). Unfortunately, Lord skims over those decades of Herriot/Wight's life, only focusing on dicrepancies between the Herriot books and reality. Overall, a disapointing read."
2,Poorly researched and highly speculative,"This can barely be called a biography. The writing gives little insight into the personality and life of ""James Herriott."" Rather it is a poorly researched and highly speculative conglomerate of anecdotes and opinions. The author makes lots of suppositions about many aspects of his subject's life with little to back up his conclusions. Much is made of the fiction versus non-fiction content of the ""All Creatures Great and Small"" books, as if it would be incredibly shocking (apparently especially shocking to Americans) to the reader. I love those books and it came as no surprise to me that a good amount of the work is fiction or fictionalized. Mr. Lord has taken what is, essentialy, a newspaper piece (and not a very good one) and streched it into a book. Herriot fans deserve a solid biography of Alf Wight. This isn't it."
2,"Disappointing, to say the least","A mean-spirited attempt to capitalize on the success of Herriot's books. Even if Graham Lord's assessment is accurate, it is entirely unnecessary to imply that Alf Wight (James Herriot) fictionalized his accounts of life as a Yorkshire vet. Those of us who have read (and loved) Mr. Herriot's stories of his life in ""Darrowby"" will be offended by this attempt to convince us that much of the content was fiction rather than fact. Let the man rest in peace and let his many readers enjoy his stories, regardless of whether they were strictly true or not. Mr. Lord claims to be Herriot's friend and confidante -- no-one needs friends like that."
2,Disillusioning,"I was very disillusioned after reading Lord's book. While it may be factual, the illusion I had of James Herriot before reading this book was more important to me than possessing the facts of Wight's life. If you cherish the warmth, kindness,and humility of Herriot's books, maybe you'd better pass on reading Lord's biography. Wight's son, according to Lord, is currently writing a biography of his father, to be released later this year."
3,Nothing here will dampen your enthusiasm.,"The real James Herriot was a soccer player. James Herriot of veterinary fame was really Alf Wight. Siegfried was really Donald. And Tristan was Brian. More surprising yet, All Creatures Great and Small is not an autobiography. It's fiction!If all this sounds too much, then don't even think about reading this book. If, on the other hand, you are one of those insatiable Herriot devotees who just can't rest until you've read everything there is to read about the famous Yorkshire vet, then by all means read on. Nothing here will dampen your enthusiasm."
1,"As a fan, but not a fanatic . . .","I'd advise you to skip right over this and go to ""Cry"", which is a solid CD, really outstanding, one that anyone would like, fan or not. ""Neapolis"" is only for Minds's fans that need a complete collection. I own it and never play it. Only one song made my MP3 playlist (Glitterball)."
2,A Dissappointing step in SM ongoing evolution,"As with an earlier review, I would avoid this CD. Not sure what Simple Minds were trying to do, but it didn't work. I've loved the band since 1981 growing up in Ireland ,through ""the commercial years"" and all since. Cry is a much better representation of where the band is now. Long live Simple Minds, but just skip this part of their evolution. Cheers!"
3,"Simple Minds, still the best kept secret in the world!","Still a big fan and will always be. When this album came out I searched high and low. The big record chains looked at me with a dazed look when I inquired about Neapolis. It was worth the hunt through some cold NY weather! Tracks 2 & 3 are the hits, offering that distinctive SM sound. ""War babies"" is the best. I can't believe this stuff isn't on the radio. I found ""War Babies"" highly addictive. Play this song in your car and you'll find yourself being pulled over by state troopers! Simple Minds has done it again and as usual, has gone unnoticed and under-appreciated. Tasteless Swords!!"
4,A remarkable collection of music,"I've been a Simple Minds fan for a number of years, and this album is definitely one of their better ones. I've read other reviews about the CD, and I'm sick of people who use words like ""stadia Krautrock of the 80's"" that mean nothing about what the CD sounds like. The bottom line is this: This CD has a number of excellent songs on it. Glitterball, War Babies, and Superman vs. Supersoul are my personal favorites. It's sounds like classic Simple Minds, but with an evolved aura about it. I recommend it to anyone who likes their type of music."
3,"A Good First Try, But Not Wilson At His Best","This book starts out well, but it gets tiring as one reads on. The end of the story is far from satisfactory, and the confusion of philosophy and reality make it obvious that Wilson still had far to go as a writer. But for an 18-year old, it is an impressive first book. The three outsiders are here (emotional, intellectual, and sensual) ... many of Wilson's later ideas are here in embryonic form; the peak experience, the narrowness of consciousness, the outsider, etc. It is a fairly enjoyable read, but it should be considered as Colin Wilson-lite."
2,It's ok but could be better.,"Dragonballz Sagaz is an OK game nothing more. I'm sure it's better than the first 2 games of the bud. seris but the third one is far better than this(minus the teleportation skill). Even tho it takes DBZing to a new level it's not above average. The one good thing i can say that came out of this is the ability to teleport, this does make a difference in your fights along with the fast ki blast that are now there(no more combo's for great skills). Not to mention the fact after you better the game and get brolly NO ONE is ever a challenge(they uber strengthed him). Over all i think this game is ok but could be A LOT better but there working on it now so i'm waiting to be impressed."
3,Hey give Atari some slack,"I found this game to be OK. It's one of the few attempts at a console DBZ RPG, and to tell you the truth, it's pretty creative. For one thing, it's real-time battles, and I've had experience at such games, like Phantasy Star Online (which is amazingly good even offline). You have your basic Kamehamehas and Galick Guns and Masenkos, etc. Like I expected, you have to buy those kinds of skills. You have to buy combos as well (what the h#!!) and you gather capsules to increase your health and energy. The game is challenging with the AI, especially the bosses (it took me a good deal of time to beat him). If you are a DBZ fan, a definite buy to add to your collection or to have fun playing. Non-DBZ fans, beware. Real-Time RPG fans, rent (maybe...)."
1,h.o.r.i.b.b.l.e,"This game was horrible and quite frankly it sucked! If anyone out there is wondering whether to buy this game or not don't. My reasons for not buying this game are it is way to short. The whole set up of the story is gay, and worse than any other dbz game. Also, there is nothing to do after the game is completed, that is right people there are no bonus missions, or levels. There only a few more charcters and level replays, and that is that. I have more points that I would like to point out about the game, but I do not have the time to right another page full. So I give this game a really bad 1/5 stars!"
4,i love it,i just have to tell you how great it is. ohh the gameplay slammin the sound system pumpin the moves dare i say POPPIN. and with the people who dont like it ill fix it and make sure every blessed dbz game IS 5 STAR MATERIAL. BUT LITTLE WINY PUNKHOLES LIKE THEM DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THERE PRECIOUS LITTLE DBZ GAMES BEING A TEENY BIT BAD. well i dont have it yet but ive played it its awesome. i played the android level and me and my friend anthony whipped em. when i get it christmas i will play it for hours on end. well by
1,sucks,this game sucks.big fan of the games and series but when they came out with this one they ruined the whole mojo of dragonball z.the last three were outstanding but getting kind of tired of the same ol thing im tired of beating cell and freiza come up with something new like they did in the gt series.my 8 year old son beat this game in 2 hours on hard but he couldnt beat the last three so i went and got my monet back.
2,nenck,it freezies to much during a fight or u get ur assss kicked by an invisible guy but cuz of glitch er wetf
3,Too linear...,"First, let's start with the pros and cons of this game.PROS:-Co-op play on story mode.-Fairly challenging.-Clips from the series on loading screens.-You fight of hordes of enemies.-The upgrade system is cool.CONS:-Too short. (It stops at the Cell Saga)-Hardly any characters.-The bosses do the same moves.-Bad landscape graphics.-You can only hold super saiyan for a certain amount of time.All in all, I'd give this game 3/5 stars. It's just too linear for my liking. It would be great if there was more individuality."
2,get any other dbz game but this,"ok,first off,they move WAY TOO SLOW.the graphics,my gosh,its like a 2nd rate n64 game i swear.fun,not really,maybe if this were on a game boy i would say 4 stars but a ps2 surely not.as far as i can tell very few characters,they are no where near as powerful as the other games.i would not get this if i were you.i bought it from here for ten bucks.it might have been worth five.get budokai one two or three they are all better than this."
2,Not exceptional.,"To be honest, I was expecting some rare DBZ 'coolness' when I bought this for my little brother to play. Together we took turns playing, and before we knew it: the game was over.Yes, you get to (almost) freely travel. Yes, the graphics are fairly plausable.But for what reason did they produce this game, when they didn't make it exceptional? Sometimes I think that the DBZ franchise is all about currancy, and for nothing else.This game was alright: but just buy Tenkaichi, instead."
4,kinda good,"i have played this game. it's good but it only goes up to the CELL GAMES. the graphics SUCK @$$. there isn't a lot of charecters. the only attacks you can use are kamehameha,masenko,galik gun,burning attack,etc. only gohan can go ss2. goku, vegeta, trunks, and broly go up to ss1."
2,Waste of the DBZ Name,This game is horrible. It is not even fun. It could have been a great game but it seems like no effort was put it. It was probably already a game and they just put the DBZ characters into it. I just expected so much more out of a DBZ title after the Budokai games.
2,What the.....,First I love the DBZ series but their games are a joke. This one is the worst. This game is about as fun as a Reg. Nintendo game just better Graphics. If you want to play this game put in a DVD on one TV and play another game on another. You would probably have more fun and still know what is going on with the cartoon. DBZ needs to make their games original. All they do is follow the series to the detail. I have seen every single episode. I dont want to play the exact same thing. I am giving two stars I guess to be nice.
4,Legit,My teenage son who plays basketball purchased the Jump Soles. He has been very satisfied with them and would purchase them again.
4,"The ""very best""? Not entirely.","I've been a fan of Liz Story's since the early 80's, and the fact that she was issuing a compilation that included tracks from albums that are no longer available (Part of Fortune, Speechless, and Escape of the Circus Ponies) was really exciting. This CD is good, but not great, for an entirely subjective reason: in my opinion, it's not strictly her very best work. I would question why, for example, when choosing the tracks from Circus Ponies, ""The Sounding Joy"" or ""The Empty Forest"" were passed over in favor of ""Church of Trees"". And why not more material from Speechless, which is stupendous from start to finish? And the title track from Solid Colors surely deserves to be included among her very best. On the other hand, as a showcase of 20 years' worth of work, the CD is very representative and gives a taste of Liz in all phases of her career. Maybe they should've called it ""A Liz Story Retrospective."""
3,EX Commodores goes solo,"This is the solo album from Thomas McClary a fine songwriter,guitarist and vocalist who was an original member of the Commodores,and recorded with them on all their Motown classics(he also went solo before Lionel Richie).This album debuted in the mid 80's and was'nt a chart shaker,however it had great material,and production. Thomas continues to release great music today."
5,Year Without A Santa Claus Snow Miser Set by NECA,"These are great toys for, both, young and old. It's great how us ""older kids"" can have fun reliving our Christmas past childhood memories with these great toys... it's, also, great for kids who are finding out what a treasure the Rankin/Bass Holiday specials are!!!!!!!!! I would not recommend this toy to anyone younger than seven or eight years of age. If you have any these toys from NECA, then HOLD ON to them and play nice with them! They do go up in value, once they are discontinued! Hey, my Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer castle quadrupled in price after buying it! What a blast! Have fun and enjoy! You can never be too old for these toys!"
4,Great just for the artwork!,"Angela Trotta Thomas is legendary in the toy train world for her nostalgic paintings. She could have been an in-house illustrator for the Lionel catalogs if she had lived a few decades earlier. The story line is kinda lame, but passable...it takes forever to get to the ""train"" parts (near the end) and if you can hold a kid's attention that long, they will LOVE the ending. The book's been out quite awhile but I just ""discovered"" it a few months ago."
3,let's be realistic,"I'm a big fan of Branford, but this recording definitely belongs to the category of apprentice-level work and those who purchase it expecting a five-star CD will probably be disappointed. As with all of his releases prior to the ""Trio Jeepy"" lp, this one finds Branford doing what many young musicians do: imitating his idols at the expense of true improvisation and creativity. One can almost listen, track by track, and say, ""OK, here he's doing Ben Webster, here it's Sonny Rolling, here Wayne Shorter"" and so forth. It's not bad music, by any means, but as someone who has followed Branford's career with interest, I would say that most listeners will want to avoid the pre-""Trio Jeepy"" records like this one, but by all means shell out for more mature efforts like ""Crazy People Music,"" ""Bloomington"" and ""Contemporary Jazz."""
3,It's good.,"I like this CD and listen to it occasionally. Some of the tunes really swing out, man. I'd like to hear more of Steep's Theme, but it's only 30 seconds long. What's up with that? I guess that's all it is, just the theme. Lots of good playing here. Thank goodness the dreaded bass direct was not used, though I would have liked to hear a few bass solos so that the absence of the dreaded bass direct could be fully enjoyed.The liner notes are terrible. It seems like they were put together as an afterthought. I just want a list of performers and composer credits for each tune, is that so much to ask?A good CD, but seems to lack a certain je ne sais quois. I think it lacks a commitment to some sort of artistic ideal. Not that it's not artistic, it just isn't focused. I enjoy it, but after listening feel as though it could have been better somehow."
2,Problems with reliability,I find this product works great about 50% of the time. Numerous times during mid-presentation it will not advance slides. Changing batteries does not improve performance!
1,Save your money buy something else,My company purchased 3 of these malfunctioning pieces of garbage. One did not work at all the other worked only intermittently. The third works 80 percent of the time. still a poor record. The laser pointer works on all three but using it to control a powerpoint presentation is risky if your business depends on it.
1,Pooped out,"I used this for a day on several computers, but after about 6 or 8 hours of use, it died. I changed batteries, tried it with several computers, and it just wouldn't work. I returned it and am looking for another device."
4,Great for what it's designed for.,"I really found this remote to be perfect for what it's supposed to do, run PowerPoint. It has a nice look, fits perfectly in the palm of your hand (as opposed to my old, bulky remote that I found myself fidgeting with), and runs PowerPoint like a dream. I have free range within my training room and quick response to commands. It is also is very easy to use with a simple layout for the technology impaired user.The only warning that I would give anyone is that the RemotePoint Navigator is designed to run PowerPoint and nothing else. If you want it to run other programs, you're better off looking for something else. In my organization, many of the subject matter experts produce their own slide shows for training or presentations. Many of them prefer to use Corel Presentations over PowerPoint (I don't know why). This remote doesn't work well with Corel Presentations because of the commands.However, if your only goal is to run PowerPoint, I highly recommend this product."
3,"Good device, but dim laser",This device is great for PowerPoint presentations. It's simple and ergonomic. The only problem is that the laser pointer is too dim. It barely shows up. I've yet to find one of these remote devices that incorporates a decent laser pointer.
2,"A DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT...","I must agree, that this disc falls short of highlighting this amazing talented voice's true vocal range and capabilities.But don't worry. For the Fado fan and the Misia fan, try the CANTO disc to get a true feeling, and I do mean FEELING, of this emotional powerful talent."
2,Sound Concept; Unsound Delivery,"This book has a lot of potential, but mostly fails to teach things you wouldn't have otherwise thought of yourself.There are several useful suggestions scattered throughout the book, but no sustained sections of good quality writing. Every time I came upon something that I wanted to read more details about, the author skipped onto to some other self-evident tangent. Also the author uses a lot of examples from her public speaking life, which are generally uninteresting and not relevant to most people's business life."
1,Horrible!,"This isn't even worth a penny! I dont recommend this at all. Now if they made this twice the size of the user's body, then I would pay the money to buy it. Plastic just doesn't beat metal."
3,Fans only,"This bit of fans-only fare see Joe clearing out the cupboards with previously unreleased tracks, covers and live tracks. The material doesn't gel together like his other albums, and only a real shred/Joe fan is going to enjoy it, although tunes like ""Bullet Train"" and the Rainbow cover ""Still I'm Sad"" stand out."
1,Boring,I can't recommend this record as I've heard it all in the past. Why people are still into 'neo-classical metal' music nowadays beggars belief. I can't recommend this record to any guitarist as there is nothing different in it.
4,Top Trails Lake Tahoe,The hikes that are noted are very clearly explained and directions are good. Limited selection of hikes as ones I was looking for were not included.
4,A Very Honorable Mention,"Axiomatic in horror films:The more you see the less you take it seriously. The best leave you jilted at the altar,but you never forget the experience. The Shout is not a horror film - it is a dare. In ""The Shout"" an organist in a diminishing parish lives for his own world of basement sound sampling. A beautiful wife puts up with him. Alan Bates the evil stranger boasts of an aboriginal shout which kills everything around. The wife is attracted. Director Skolimowski is not one to chicken out. We get the shout. A great premise, maybe impossible to pull off."
5,Absolute must 4 music lovers,This CD is one of the best I ever heared.Pleople that like Dream Theater should listen to this CD.Other tips:- Pain of Salvation- Spocks Beard- Incubus
1,You have to be kidding?,If anyone who heard the first CD by this all-star prog band and like this second attempt has not listened deeply to it. I found every song on this CD to be weak andd hollow when compared to the first CD. I listened to to this CD about 6 times and traded it in at my local used CD store. I think the members of this group took them selves to seriously and thought they could throw anything together and it would smell like a rose. Most reviewers think so but I urge you to listen deeply to it. You to will be at your used CD store finding something interesting.
1,'taint SMPTe...,"Musical gym overcompensaters might like it, but that's if you actually consider Dream Theatre to be progressive (I dig Mike Portnoy's drumming, but he should lose THAT band). Some of it sounds like they're trying to rip off Tool, another great band, but C'mon, guys, did YOU have to?!? I gave SMPTe 5 stars; it deserves 15 1/2, but the sophmore release sounds like alcoholics-turned-Christian rockers would worship it, good or bad. Oh well; sorry Pete; you're still my bass player hero!"
4,"Excellent, but plays it too safe","I bought this CD based on who was in the band, every member is an exceptional musician on their own. The only down side to that is I expected more than any band could realistically deliver. Don't get me wrong, this CD is fantasic and one of my current favorites. The musical abilities are impressive and demonstrated well. My one disappointment is that it did not delve into new or experimental shades of music enough. It mainly sticks to formats they have all done in the past, and done very well. Sort of 'plays it safe' in a way. I am still very happy with my purchase and would buy it again, happily."
3,Disappointing second outing,"Why do so many reviews come with five stars? I have 'lived' with this CD now for a couple of weeks and can only rate it as average. The original outing from the band, SMPTE, comtained all the elements of a new fresh project, interesting songs, great melodies and some truelly spine tingling guitar solo's. Whilst this second album may have moved the whole game on some of the magic of that first effort has somehow got lost. Not bad but certainly not worthy of five stars."
3,hmmm...,I personally did not like this album as much as I enjoyed the first one. But it is still good and deserves to be a CD in any Portnoy fan's collection.
5,2001's Best Progressive Rock CD,"The combination of the 4 musicians from Spock's Beard, Dream Theater, The Flower Kings, and Marrillion, really comes out on this latest CD. It is a masterpiece of Epic progressive rock. The music is creative and the lyrics are deep and timely considering what is going on in the world today. I keep playing it over and over. Fantastic CD!!!!"
3,3 1/2 stars actually ...,"Anyone who wants to buy the new Agnostic Front record will be pleased with their purchase as AF will give you exactly what you expect. For those awaiting a re-write of THEE classic AF record - 'Victim in Pain' - well, this is as close as the boys have come. Every song is raging, fast, 3 chords, with Miret's classic, indecipherable growl & plenty of old-school ""gang"" vocals all over the place. Yeah - it sounds like the guys could have written the whole record in one weekend - but it is definitely the best of the 3 ""reunion"" records. Those who have been fans of AF for almost 20 years now will know what to expect, and they'll love it. It will change no one's mind who's not a fan, though. The record cover is somewhat silly, and, in light of the 9/11 attack, a disclaimer sticker was put over the front cover. They're legends - if you're a fan of hardcore - you can't be without 'Victim in Pain', 'Cause for Alarm', or 'Liberty & Justice...'. This is a good addition to the legacy."
2,Not what I was looking for,I purchased these pads to address an issue with my PS3 FAT 60's Bluray drive and unfortunately these were not what I needed; they were about a half a millimeter thick and would not come off the tabs they were affixed to without major damage. If you are looking to fix an overheating issue with your PS3's Bluray drive I would suggest looking elsewhere since all five of the included tabs would not even span half the distance between the drives chip and the heat distribution board.
1,Thermal Pads ... Never again,"Pack i received was worthless, doesn't stick well enough to sink which made it impossible to take off the wax paper.Went back to using arctic silver, tricky to get a smooth even layer, but it is easier to use.No more pads for me, and i won't recommend these to anybody else."
1,"In a word, worthless","Complete waste of time and money. Purchased these thermal pads for use in installing a new heatsink and fan assembly into my HP Pavilion dv2911us laptop. These pads were extremely thin - all five put together wouldn't equal one-quarter of the thickness of the original thermal padding I wanted to replace. Secondly, the adhesive backing was so tight against the pads that I couldn't separate the thermal material from the backing without tearing the thermal material.If you want to replace thick thermal padding from a laptop, do yourself a favor and buy the proper material from a laptop parts reseller.If you are applying fresh thermal material to a computer and you don't require thickness, just get thermal compound."
3,paste is better,it doesnt stick on my first 2 tries. i should have bought the paste instead. but the product is working. watch out for the pads not sticking on the metals (heatsink) and will end up wasting one.
3,You'd be much better off with a ceramic-based grease,"I got this thinking the pads would directly replace the pads Dell used on my portable's heat sink tubing. I was wrong. These pads are very thin, and Dell's was quite thick.I wound up using a ceramic-based grease from Arctic Silver that is not electrically conductive in place of the former padded area. I had to make sure the grease comfortably came up to the heat pipe, but it did and this worked phenomenally well. Temperatures on my processor, bus, and video chip all went down by at least 20 degrees.This pad will surely work for some, but if you need something with such small tolerance, why not get a high-performance grease that also won't conduct electricity?Strangely, the pricing here is double what I could have paid at a local computer store. FYI."
3,Hard to find,"Thermal pads are becoming extinct in the PC business. I like and use them because I don't want to be bothered with paste. It is just so simple to stick these on like a sticker and be done. They work fine for all but the hardcore over-clockers. If your building a PC and want quick and easy TIM and aren't going to over-clock then this is what your looking for. If you plan on doing over-clocking or removing the HSF all the time then use paste.The only con I had with the pack I received is they appeared to have been slightly pre-heated as the back release liner was difficult to remove. I suspect this is an isolated case, and when I get through the ones I have I will be ordering again."
1,Worst purchase ever,"I thought these pads would make thermal heatsink to CPU easy and effective. WRONG! I destroyed three of them as they did not stick and they are way too thin. The other two I got rid of. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. Besides, the shipping cost was higher than the actual purchase. The package weighs next to nothing. Use XBRdepot Arctic Silver Ceramique Premium High Density Thermal Compound 2.5g instead. This goo works great with enough stuff to do several jobs. Alas, be prepared for high shipping costs on this as well."
2,Can't get it off the paper,"I ordered this thinking it would be better than applying grease to the CPU.I removed the one side of the protective paper, only to find out that I can't remove the other side without destroying the square shape. After two failed attempts at removing the thermal pad. I put them in the freezer.After about 30 minutes, the pad had become hard enough to remove from the paper and was put on the CPU. So far, CPU has not overheated yet, so I guess the product works, but it is a pain to get it off the paper."
3,Not as specified.,I bought this product to repair an 8800 GT video card. The pads were not as thick as specified. But after doubling up the pads I cut they worked great.
2,It melted onto the processor,"Two weeks after putting it on, I check it and it seemed to have melted onto the processor. It was much more difficult to remove this than removing a regular thermal paste. For me it seemed to work for properly for maybe five days. Putting it on was not difficult at all, after reading about it on 'the net'. I would not buy it again, so will not recommend it to anyone."
3,A So So Read,"This book was just okay for me. It was written well, but I felt too much time was spent on getting Angie ready to go out into the world. I read it a few days, but because I wanted to get on to another book. If you like chick lit, you might like this, but for me it was just all right."
4,Works well,"Does what it's supposed to, but you'd be better off buying the individual turnaround pieces. There are still cases where it doesn't fit in the layout and you wish you had a smaller piece."
5,well what do you know?,my kid loved bending these pieces around ti the right track end. i loved always having the right track adapter!
5,Great music! Great variety! Great price!,"This is the favorite cd for everyone in our family (ages 9, 12, and 40-something parents). Sharon is accompanied by a variety of superb musicians on tunes from her previously released cd's. She's kinda like the Ry Cooder of Irish accordion music: she's at home in a variety of styles, excels at all of them, and makes music that's joyous and moving. She and her musical companions will definitely have you tapping your feet, if not dancing across the floor. If you like traditional Irish music or Irish music with an electric update, you'll like this. You may not realize how good an accordion can sound, til you've heard Sharon's dancing fingers. This cd will be right at home on your shelf with the Bothy Band, Altan, Solas, and Donal Lunny's Coolfin."
2,dull dull dull,"Fell for the hype, but can't see anything here at all. Not folk, not rock, just a kind of bloodless white boy blues."
5,First there were The Plimsouls...,"...and then there wasn't. What followed on this debut caught many of us by delighted surprise. Jangly, heart felt: a guitarist's album released when there was still room for such solid music."
3,Simple and informative but the CD templates DO NOT MATCH,"This is a good simple book on incorporation in any of the 50 states. It includes plain English descriptions of the requirements and responsibilities of corporations. However, the Adobe PDF forms on the CD in some cases do not match the content of the book."
5,i loved putting this puzzle together,"this has been my favorite puzzle for many many years. i prefer the round puzzles so many people can work around it without having the edges block the way for new pieces to fit in. all the pieces fit together well.i have read the odyssey, even making love while going thru the clashing rocks thru the dardenelles, shortly before seeing the rosey fingers of dawn arise over the horizon...this was challenging enough, and let my mind distinguish many different areas of color to put the puzzle together.i would buy another such puzzle by this maker, and i have ordered a romeo and juliet that seems similar.the pieces held up well, the edges didn't fray, and i plan on building it several times a year, to see how fast i can get it together!great company, quality construction, and a little history thrown in!"
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"I RECIEVED ULTIMATE OMEGA 500, NOT ULTIMATE OMEGA. THE PRODUCT I RECIEVED IS STRAWBERRY FLAVORED AND HAS ONLY HALF THE AMOUNT OF EPA AND DHA OF THE PRODUCT THAT IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR SALE."
3,Couldnt really notice the difference for the Price,I take Fish oil everyday and to be honest I couldn't really tell any difference from these that what I get from Walmart. I know they are better quality supposedly but I couldn't tell. I got recommended these by a friend and I am sure they are good just cant justify the price for someone who takes a lot of them
4,If you have ancestors from New Haarlem you will love this book,"I used this book to research my Dutch ancestors who helped found New Haarlem and I wasn't disappointed. This book is a gold mine of rich details, maps of actuals locations of homes, and much, much more. I'm really happy I bought this book because though it I came to understand what life was like in this settlement. I also recommend ""The Island at the Center of the World"" by Russell Shorto. If you are a student of this time period, you will love it."
5,My Book,"I havent used either firewire cables yet, but my usb is working great. I havent noticed a wait for it to come up on my desktop like other reviews stated. I have a total of 465gb available to use. The fan is really quite. the only noise it makes is when you start using it, it seems to make a little buzz. It is hard to notice it though."
5,So far so good!,"Don't want to jinx it. Most mechanical items fail me, and this has not and it's been a few months. I definitely recommend it."
2,Poor components?,"This drive refused to work with my MPB. It would sometimes show up and then once it did, it would hang my system. Dont buy this until WD has figured out what's causing these problems. On the positive side it's got the connections I was looking for at a decent price. Returned and went with LaCie."
2,Slowly died,"Worked great for about 6 months months. Then started having intermittent hangs. Usually a reboot solved it, but it happened more frequently until it failed to work at all. None of the three interfaces work on any of my computers at this point. I've used several of the lower capacity MyBook drives with no problems for several years now, but this failure is making me reconsider my replacement choice."
1,Don't try to use two of these,"I bought two of these drives to hook up to my Mac. Well, either one works, but not both at the same time. Connecting both causes the other to disconnect and just go away. Tech support has not provided help, so far. I've got multiples of other vendor drives connected, so I know it can be done."
1,Don't Try With a MAC,"I have had WD My Books work great on PC's so I purchased this PRO edition for my imac. Had trouble getting it to mount, finally got USB to work, but the firewire never mounted. Called WD customer support and they had me return the drive. After my experience I did some research and it seems this is common with this drive and the MAC."
3,Pretty good,The drive is pretty good and fast. Its been used with an iMac for the last 2 years. Recently it has started giving off a high pitch sound. I'm backing up my data just incase the drive fails.Edit:I called Western Digital and they replaced the drive with a newer 750GB drive since the drive was still under warranty!
3,lasted just beyond warranty,"Well, it worked great until just before the warranty ended. Then it began to have problems powering on. WD was kind enough to quickly replace the power cord which seemed to fix the problem for several months (long enough for the warranty to expire). Not too much longer later the hard drive died completely. Hmm, not sure about WD quality."
5,Good mix of speed and capacity,"This is my 6th firewire drive, and my 2nd firewire 800 drive. Of all the drives I now own, this is the most quiet and quickest drive to date. This drive has been tasked with the daily backup duties for a recording studio and has performed without complaint. For the price today there is not a better deal out there for 500GB of quick storage."
3,Daisy-chain Problems for Mac Users,"I'm a Mac user and own two of these drives and one 500GB My Book Premium ES. I like the drives, and they have all worked well for me individually. Unfortunately, unlike the claim in the Product Description, I have not been able to daisy-chain any of my drives together or these drives with drives from other makers; in fact, when I try to daisy-chain with these drives, my Mac won't recognize any of them at all! After researching this issue, I discovered that the problem seems to be some sort of conflicting IDs with these drives. Apparently, Western Digital is aware of the problem, but has not yet issued any kind of fix (and doesn't even mention it at all on their Support pages).So, if you are a Mac user considering buying this drive and don't care about daisy-chaining, then this may be the drive for you. If you think that you'd want to daisy-chain with these drives, then you should check out this issue."
4,Great drive. Only one problem.,"This is a great drive and met all my expectations apart from one thing.I bought two identical drives for backing up one to the other.Daisy chaining them together was what I expected to do, but it just won't work. What did work however, is connecting the drives to the computer individually. In my case, one drive with Firewire and one with USB. This is inconvenient and, more importantly, very slow transfer.The response from Western Digital Customer support regarding my problem:""You have a known issue and unfortunately, we have no fix. I recommend you use one drive with USB and the other with FireWire.""Not great. You might wanna consider this if you plan to use them the way I intended to."
4,"Nice 3.5"" 500 GB drive!","Sufficient space, 500 Gigs. Nice, sleek case.No major problems so far. Drive runs cool and quiet, not as noisy as stated in other reviews.As with any other large capacity drive, re-formatting to NTFS could take some time.Cons: Didn't get the 1394A interface to work on the first shot."
5,Excellent,I have used this ext.HD several times and it comes in great use. My wife can use it on her MAC while I use it on my laptop which is windows based.... so all in all it is perfect for us both.
3,Noisy -!!,"Wow, this thing is very noisy, I may have to find a sound proof booth for it. The Accomdata drive I brought two years ago is whisper silent, plus it has 2 FW-800 ports for expansion. The WD Pro only has one FW-800 - So out of the three types of connections available the slowest one was chosen for expansion. And remember FW800 is not backward compatible to FW400."
4,Works Great With Macs,"Great Product, is my third one connected daisy chained to my Mac. Removed all of Western Digital software and reformatted in Mac OS X Journaled.Quiet and trouble free."
5,Doing exactly what it should,"This drive has been running constantly since I purchased it nearly a month ago, serving as a storage drive for a large, environmental model that I use for research. I simply plugged it in to my XP workstation, and began writing and reading files seamlessly. Very simple installation (none really) for WinXP USB use, although I purchased the pro edition because I wanted to interface with Firewire in the near future. Little noise, little heat, little worry. It currently holds about 350 GB of data, and I'm considering buying a second once this one fills. I'm overall pleased."
3,Outdated now.,"This was the best purchase in 2007. Now it is outdated, will require AC plug into the wall outlet; USB WILL NOT POWER THIS BIG BOY. Still very fast and powerful. Good for storing important documents and other data for long term storage. Too bad, FireWire didn't make it to mainstream as expected."
2,"Two bought, three died.","I purchased two of these drives in September and October of 2006. It is now January 2010. Both drives have failed (but, to WD's credit, have been replaced under warranty for free), and now one of the replacement drives have failed.I have a good backup strategy and haven't lost any data, but there's an inconvenience to the almost inevitable fact that these drives will fail you eventually.To get a sense of my usage patterns, these drives were plugged into a Mac mini running 24/7 serving as an iTunes server."
2,It's a good product until it crashes,"I guess it is inevitable that these external hard drives will eventually crash. It's almost like you need a backup for you backup. But I lost all of my music, videos, documents, and pictures with no way of getting them off back. All it does now is click when you plug it in (Head Crash). However it is a good product until it crashes and it will crash!!!"
1,No good for Macs,"I've owned a couple of WD My Book drives, and this one has been the worst, although the most expensive. Every now and then, it simply refuses to mount on my Macbook. I've tried to fix this with every method recommended on Apple forums and elsewhere about the web, but Apple is uninterested in helping with 3rd party software, and WD is uninterested in helping, period. I end up having to erase the whole drive and copy from my backup drive. In the 6 months I've owned it, this has happened four times. Utter junk."
1,DATA LOST - Dead Unit after 2 months,"I wouldnt buy it. WD tells me they will replace the drive, ok fine, what about recover my lost files? Nope.This drive hardly lasted 2 months."
1,Garbage.,"I bought this on January 27th 2007 & today August 1st 2007 it died. Ominous clicking sound you hear about when you google ""Western Digital Mybook clicking fail"".I loved it when I first got it, because it does look nice, but it runs very hot & unmounted from time to time spontaneously. This is not isolated incident if you look around the internet."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I have two external hard drives for my Mac, this one and a LaCie. The LaCie boots up instantly every time. This one almost never does. Some times it takes 45-60 minutes to show up, sometimes it never does. Requires endless rebooting and relaunching. Customer support was useless. I will never buy another drive from this company."
1,"Slow when it works, bad tech support","When the drive is working, it is so slow as to be almost unusable. I spent hours combing through the WD knowledge base and could find nothing to help. Worse, after a few days the Mionet program started throwing an error that says it cannot get my username, and then refuses to open. I emailed WD tech support and 2 emails and 3 days later they still haven't responded. Now all of my data is inaccessible, the knowledge base has no entry for this error, and tech support won't respond. Purchase this product at your own risk. I'll be returning mine as soon as I find a way to get my data off of it."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DRIVE,"This is a huge mistake - don't buy this device. One day, it was working fine, the next it was dead. I had the drive for about 8 weeks. ALL OF THE DATA IS GONE.DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE.If you go to Western Digital's site there are over 1600 users who ask the question ""Why is my hard drive dead and why is my data gone?""I think that says it all."
1,This one isn't worth the trouble,"I bought this particular My Book Pro on April 17, 2007. Last Monday, July 28, 2008, it died. There was no warning and no apparent cause. I wouldn't recommend this drive to my worse enemy."
1,What a Dud!,"We purchased this in April 2007 and by mid-2008 it had stopped working. An apparent power failure. After contacting the manufacturer we were told to send the whole unit back. Since we're not crazy about shipping our confidential data to ""who knows who,"" we'll be purchasing a different backup system - not Western Digital -- ever.What a way to waste $230."
3,problems with the install,"I had problems with the install. I can't make the firewire cable work, it will only run off the usb cable. Once I got the software installed I found I don't care for it so will be replacing that."
1,Beware,"I bought this HD because my Lacie (which had lasted over 5 years) crashed on me finally. So I figured I would try a different company. Out of the box this product looked great, although it was very large and heavy. I immediately plugged it in to test it and it came up - however that was the one and only time that it booted. I tried several more times and it wouldn't boot up. VERY VERY scary when you buy a new device to hold all you important data and it won't boot up out of the box. I don't know if this product just happened to be the one that sucked - but I am not taking any chance on a defective HD and my data. Going back to Lacie!"
4,Great audio-only receiver,"This is a fine unit at a very affordable price. [..]. It's no-frills. Just 5.1 (not 6 or 7). The remote is very basic, the is no on-screen guide. The video input is only the most basic (so S-Video and certainly no component). But, it does a very nice job just pumping out sound. DTS is included. I have it paired up with the Athena Point 5 speakers, and I'm very happy.The daily frustrations are: remote is not very well designed, only one optical input (but 3 digital overall).As the other reviewer commented: very good for the budget-minded."
4,not the best of her,"After reading Buket Uzuner's 3 novels, I wrote an e-mail to my favorite writer. With her answer, she sent me some of her stories. Well, I must confess that they are not the best things she wrote. My advice to the readers: ""Read 'Mediterranean Waltz'(Kumral Ada~Mavi Tuna)"". This is the book which made me a fan of Buket Uzuner and certainly her best novel. Love could never be told such well...and 'well' is such a simple word for that book!..."
3,Is that all she could do ?,"Buket Uzuner has been one of the most successful writers of modern Turkey . But I am afraid I will not be able to say the same thing about her Karayel Huznu. First of all , the language is far behind what is now called ""pure Turkish"" . There are couple of language mistakes ... as many people critize about Buket Uzuner's other books . The content is amazing on the other hand ,the story is much more challenging than one would expect . Nothing else to say ... Read it and form your own ideas !"
1,Disappointed.,It's been way over the arrival date and it's still not here. It's been over a month. Poor college kid either wants money back or the CD she ordered.
4,Emmanuel is a gem!!,I have just received this CD and I can't stop playing it!!! He is quickly becoming one of my favorites!!
4,Fantastic French Pop Album,Because French is my second language and I am still very rough I purchased this CD because I'd heard him on the radio while living in France for four months. Although I still have not figured out all of the lyrics I can say that the music is uplifting and fun to listen to. Excellent to practice the language.
2,Awesome if they held up longer,"I love keens. I have 3 pair of sandals, a pair of boots and these ""flip flop"" type sandals. I've had two of my regular sandals for over 2 years and they're well worn. I loved these the moment I got them. They are cute and comfortable. But I've had them for less than 4 months and they are falling apart. I haven't worn them any more or less than any other keen sandals, so I'm not sure why they're falling apart. I may have gotten unlucky, but I wouldn't buy them if they aren't on sale. Too expensive to only wear a few times for one summer."
4,Very Comfortable,"I ordered these shoes to wear on a trip to Israel, because I had a pair last summer that I loved. These were very comfortable for a LOT of walking however the back edge began to separate in a week."
4,LOVE MY KEENS!!!,"This is one of five pairs of Keens' sandals that I own and is my favorite. They are soooo comfortable and I love the way my feet look in the shoe; covered, but not. The only thing that would make this shoe better would be if it were in leather with a black sole. (Then, again, leather would probably cause your feet to sweat in very hot weather.) Otherwise, they are perfect!"
2,The record company won,I came on board with Too Far To Care (an unheralded classic mix that defies the simplistic country/punk/metal/pop genres). It was by far their best album. I liked Fight Songs a hell of a lot. It had lost some of the edge/sting of Too Far but it was still damn good.I hate to say it but Satellite Rides feels like some record company exec kept telling the band what would sell and blanded the hell out of them. The beats and chords are simple and predictable. And I never thought I would say that about the 97's.
3,NOT THE SAME!,"10 minutes into the movie ""Clay Pigeons"", a song played that blew my socks off! That song was by OLD 97's! Soon after that, I owned all their releases! BUT...here we have a completely different story. We have the stereotype. The major label picks up the innovative group and tries to convert it into a money machine! No!!! This is not about the love of money! It's about great songs & artistic freedom! It took a while for Elektra to pursuade this group to change but the day is here! From their traditional hell-raising rockabilly sound, I count ONE track! Nice retro-looking cover but it falls apart from that point on..."
2,Whiny...,"This album can't hold a candle to thier earlier releases WRECK YOUR LIFE, TOO FAR TO CARE, or HITCHHIKE TO RHOME! This is alt/country/pop. Or poop as I like to call it. Sold the album on ebay! What happened to the real stuff fellas??"
4,"Ride on, boys...","The Old 97's are back in town with Satellite Rides. Yeah, it's a bit more ""pop""y than even Fight Songs was, but there's still the underlying coolness that makes you love them. I've seen Rhett in his solo So.Cal. gigs, so a lot of the songs weren't new to me, but it was cool hearing the full band behind them. Each of the songs has a hook that pulls me in...and I noticed that it's best played LOUD. Can't wait for them to come back to town...I'll be there!"
5,The Car Stereo CD of 2001!,"I took a chance on this album after hearing the band's rousing version of Marty Robbins' 'El Paso' on the 'King of The Hill' Soundtrack. It has not been out of my car stereo since then! Think Replacements meet Johnny Cash with some BNL lyrics thrown in. This album is a great hybrid of Rock, Pop, and Country, from the rocking guitars of 'King of All of the World' to the sweet romantic sentimentality of 'Question' to the sinister brooding of 'Nervous Guy'. The best songs on the CD are the small town rockers 'Rollerskate Skinny' and 'Buick City Complex'. With lyrics such as ""Do you wanna meet up at the Pickwood Bowl/We can knock nine down and leave one in the hole"", the Old '97s show a lyrical intelligence so badly missing from the Creed-N'Sync-Madonna infested radio airwaves. The best CD I've heard so far this year!"
4,Orbiting Smoothly (revisited),"Normally, I wouldn't come back and edit a review I had written earlier, but this album compels me to do so. When I first reviewed this album, I was ambivalent about it. I felt that some of the songs were forced (""Buick City Complex,"" ""What I Wouldn't Do"") and that the band seemed headed straight for a writing formula (kind of like what began happenning to Paul Westerberg in the early 90s). But now I'm beginning to feel like I was a victim of overblown expectations. After living with it for a little while (putting it away and coming back to it) this is one of the more solid and enjoyable albums I've bought this year, and songs like ""Roller Skate Skinny,"" ""Question,"" ""Weightless,"" and ""Can't Get a Line"" show that the band hasn't lost any of the romantic wit and charm that made ""Too Far To Care"" so good (but, then again, I actually like ""Fight Songs"" so what do I know)."
2,"Not an E-ticket ride, though....","i am an admitted Old 97's fan, and am all for the ""evolution"" of a band, but this CD is their weakest by far IMHO. i have had to purchase new copies of Too Far to Care, Wreck Your Life and Fight Songs because i wore them out. this one just sits in its case, and not because it's less alt-country, but because musically it just doesn't hang together as a whole, doesn't have the flow and cohesiveness of their other releases, tho there are a few standout tracks. feels like they're THINKING about it too much....a big disappointment to me."
3,Hopefully a phase for the 97's,"I liked this album for about two weeks. After that, the disc never made another spin. I found the lyrics not up to Rhett Miller's usual standard and I found the music boring after a few spins. For the past few years I have been living off of a steady diet of their previous four albums. While many thought of 'Fight Songs' as a departure from the 97's core sound, I really liked it. Unfortunately I found 'Sattelite Rides' to be a little too poppy and slickly-overproduced.Putting the weaknesses aside, this is a relatively strong album in a very weak music market. 'Am I too Late' 'Buick City Complex' and 'Designs on You' are all great 97's outputs. However, overall this album is weak and overproduced."
1,"Dan should re-record ""Feelin' Happy"" ..............","There are a few nice tunes here, but they need a revamp because the synths sound so prehistoric. Quantum changes have been made with electronic sounds since this release in 1987, so much so that I find this cd hard to listen to now.Dan really came of age with ""Inside Out"" in 2004. Buy that instead."
3,Aragon at U,"What's the ""U""? I have no idea! But the music is fine. There are moments when it takes me back to the late 1950's when the Aragón, Orquesta América, and Fajardo were my favorites... Alas, when I could still dance in the style of the times! And, has anyone but me noticed that cha-cha-chá is no longer danced like it was in the 1950's, except in competitions? Now it's easier, because all we have to do is move our derriere! Back then we had to jump all over the dance floor as well as move every inch of our bodies -- but never sensually!There are moments when I swear that another Aragón is playing, specially when I hear those ""s"" and ""r"" so beautifully ennunciated. We, Cubans, don't sound those letters so clearly, after all. Generally speaking, I recommend the CD. It has a couple of forgotten songs nice to re-visit. If you can afford it, add it to your collection."
2,Not faithful to the greatness of the work,"Possibly interesting to the specialist, particularly in the treatment of dischord, but this is not a sincere rendition of the Matthew Passion. As mentioned by previous reviewers, tempos are too fast. What does it mean that to consider the initial chorus ""Kommt, ihr Toechter, helft mir klagen"" (come ye daughters, share my mourning) as a jig? Not what Bach meant! And this is an ""authentic"" performance! If you are looking for a ""period"" performance, I would advise Gardiner's, although I am sure there are others which also maintain due respect for the theme of the passion."
1,"Light Years Away (Les Années lumière) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Spain ]",Eric Roberts do not play in these movie. I'm a huge fan of Eric and this movie means nothing for me! Sorry for it but I think in do NOT want to watch it!
3,A comb is a comb...,"But, for a buck during the ""Friday Sale"" you can't complain too much. However, they won't last long as the plastic is thin and the edges are a bit sharp."
3,Quilting Space not so perfect.,"I was anxious to receive this book because I had read the other reviews, and wanted to see for myself. I agree that the other Sewing Spaces BookDream Sewing Spaces: Design & Organization for Spaces Large & Smallthat I have is better. I wouldn't really recommend this oneCreating Your Perfect Quilting Space: Sewing-Room Makeovers for Any Space And Any Budgetover that. I love books, and Sewing Places and Spaces books are among my favs. I'll keep this one, but if someone wants it I'll definitely give it away."
4,Great ideas,"If I were starting to build a room specifically for crafting, these are wonderful ideas, but a little extreme as far as setting it up. But I did give the book to a friend building anew home that may be able to afford all the items in the pictures shown."
5,"Really, really great spaces",These were great ideas and the various spaces usable in the house to convert to a quilting room can be amazing.
2,It's about the size of a magazine....,"Actually I have thicker magazines than this book. Please note that it's only 96 pages. I somehow missed that when I ordered. For $17.79, I really expected something chunkier...something actually worth $17.79. And I bought this as a gift. Sigh."
2,"This book, money and a large room work well together","I had eagerly awaited the arrival of this book but must admit I was disappointed in it. I didn't find the information new, creative or inexpensive. If I had a large room, a carpenter husband to build shelves, or money to have them made, like most of the rooms portrayed in this book, then I wouldn't have needed help setting up my sewing room! I found the two books ""Dream Sewing Spaces"" by Lynette Ranney Black and ""Setting Up Your Sewing Space"" by Myrna Giesbecht to be filled with more ideas for storage and room design than ""Creating Your Perfect Quilting Space""."
2,Beautiful but ....,Amazing how extremely uncluttered and tidy studios can look. Always wonderif they are ever used or just a space to lounge in.
5,Creating Your Perfect Quilting Spacke,The author of this book has been to my house-I just know she has.My family could not believe that other people had a messy area as I did. This book has pictures to prove it! I have already implimented some of the ideas. I couln't wait to get started and the ideas have proven to be great. Anyone who loves to have a stash of anything could use this book. I have already shared with other quilting friends. The Quilted Barn
2,"You too can have a great sewing room with 1,000's of dollars.","I was looking forward to this book as I have a new chaotic sewing studio that needs order. When I started looking through it I was interested in the low budget makeovers and pleased to see the first one (or so) was done for approx. $100. That was really the one and only low budget makeover in the book! All the others were done for $1000's. Not exactly ""every budget."" Oh well, the pictures were interesting. And if you are a woodworker, have extraneous furniture in other parts of the house or have some cash to spend you have lots of ideas."
2,MORE A WOMAN'S WATCH!,"Unfortunately, this watch did not live up to expectations... It is more a woman's' watch than for a man... I had no issues with the features etc, but for me, just too small.. I phoned amazon, spoke to a customer service person who without question accepted my explanation.. I returned the watch and purchased another Nautica watch which I am more than 100% happy with... Thank you Amazon for your promptness in refunding my purchase...I am more than satisfied with the service I receive... Some times the pictures do not do justice to the product being advertised..."
4,Nice watch,"I really like how the watch looks and fits; just two problems:1. Second hand tick is particularly loud2. Too much writing on the dial (Indiglo, Water resistant) makes it look too busy"
4,"Good casual watch, solid bargain","Have had this watch for about six months, and it keeps time to within three seconds of my original setting. The Indiglo feature, and luminous hands and dial make it VERY easy to read at night, although the date feature is a bit small. The band is comfortable, but beware that it will lose its brown ""tan""--likely the dye wearing away--if it becomes wet, and the band will take on a mottled brown/black appearance. Still, it's hard to beat this casual watch at this price point (I paid less than $50), and the cream-colored dial/blue second hand add just enough panache to set it apart from a lot of other relatively inexpensive watches."
5,A Classic...,At 25.... i still like 2 think back when i was younger and how u used 2 read C. Pike and R.L. Stine.. Witch was one of the BEST Pike novels... It pulls you in and makes u care about whats happening 2 the characters even with the sad endings i STILL LOVED IT!!!! Also my fav was the Remember Me series.. and of COURSE The Last Vampire.....
5,One of the Best!,"It is a novel that has a sad ending, but it is GREAT! I read in a day; I couldn't put it down, not even for a second."
3,Surprisingly Good,"When I was given this book to read as a reccomendation, I read the back and decided that it wasn't the book for me. But I'm glad that I gave it a try. Like the other Christopher Pike book I read, it is suspenseful and almost controlling without knowing. You tell yourself just one more chapter, until eventually you're tear eyed as you turn the last page. A great book."
5,"""Witch"" is the best!","I am a HUGE Christopher Pike fan and I have to say, this is one of his best books! I couldn't put it down, and the ending made me cry so hard! I've had 6 copies so far, and I can't loan it out anymore- the person I loan it to almost always ends up begging me to let them keep it!!"
2,"To Help, to Heal",I didn't find this book very interesting it was about a girl named Julia who has the power to heal with her touch.Her mother had always told her not to look in a full moon gleaming on water and one day she does and she sees something terrible. Will she be able to stop it from happening? I was camping with my class and read it instead of going to bed it didn't spook me and I found it kind of boring.
3,Not the best,"This book was O.K., but could have been better. It was confusing. And the end was as expected as it was lame. The book was just one long rant from Julia."
5,Classic Pike,"Julia is a witch who looks into a pond with sunshine on it and sees current events. Only she breaks a rule and accidentally views the pond with moonlight on it sees the future. What she sees changes her behavior, she does things she wouldnt have done otherwise to try and change the future as she saw it in the pond. Of course, our actions always have consequences and so do Julia's. Its an excellent read with a heartbreaking ending."
5,Commonality between Eastern and Western Creation myths.,"""There is a mystical truth behind every physical fact even as there is a moral force behind every aspect of universal law""...""the letter of the law killeth but the spirit of the law giveth life"". Hall's visually sumptuous interpretation of classical Greek creation myths is breathtaking. Both thrillingly readable and footnotely scholarly, his revelation of the common origins of the myths of East and West unfolds with the timeless rhythm of the Music of the Spheres!"
5,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!,"Love it. Bought this back inthe day when it first came out! Lost it, needed it! Izzy needs to do more."
4,Glad I purchased Izzy's CD.,"Hi! It was fun to hear Izzy singing and listen to his compositions. Any chance to hear Izzy's guitar playing is welcome! Who knew that he played the harmonica? This is great car driving music. Keep composing and playing, Izzy!Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel are great musicians; however, when they sing together, it is like one voice/one muscial instrument. Ditto for Izzy and Axl Rose. Magic happens when Izzy and Axl mix their talents together. Just for fun, it would be interesting to see how mixing some of Axl's voice in this CD would change the compositions.Will Izzy be publishing a book like Duff McKagan, Slash, and Steven Adler? It would be great to learn about Izzy's experiences, too.Does Izzy dance?"
5,JUST GREAT !!!,"I bought this album (cassette actually, then the CD) when it came out in 1992. To this day, I never tire of it, and it still holds a hallowed place in my heart and on my iPod. Everything else you're read here about the Exile On Main Street similarities and down & dirty rock n roll are all true. Seek out this CD, and you shan't be disappointed. Wish Izzy would tour though."
5,A gem!,"What a great album. I bought this years ago from Tracks record store in South Bend, IN along with Keith Richards' ""Main Offender."" Two great albums from two great talents. ""Time Gone By"" is one for the ages."
3,Not From the Gunners but Hey,"This ain't Guns n Roses, but it is a great album. By listening to this you realize how much Axl held Izzy down (as well as most of the other members). It is reminicent of the Rolling stones and some of the softer Gunner tunes like Pacience."
1,a collection of junk,"Izzy Stradlin was the best songwriter in Guns & Roses. He wrote most of the band's well known and most timeless songs. He was also an excellent singer and he sang some of our favorite GNR songs such as; Dust N Bones, 14 Years, and Double Talkin Jive. Without Izzy GNR imploded, shriveled up and died a slow death. Unfortunatley, Izzy seems to have blown his load with GNR. His first solo album is a boring, mess of an album. Its uninspired and flat and not at all indictive of what Izzy seemed capable of..."
1,The Rolling Stones without emotion ...,"It was mentioned that this CD sounds like TRS which is true.Unfortunately, it lacks any impetus to listen to it.CD already gone."
2,Just some trace of what GNR was,"I bought this CD because I think there is not a lot of good rock music nowadays. I was trying to find something new (new for me) with a touch of good old rock. I tought that Izzy Stradlin, being one of the main songwritters of GNR had to write at least a couple of great songs for his debut solo album. However, it was dissapointing to find out that this CD is just full of mediocre songs. In fact these songs sound just like the usual GNR filler songs that one doesn't listen too often from their CDs. some better than the other but not a single song to mention. Well, I should have known better why this album was not very popular back then when Izzy was incredibly famous."
1,What the hell is this?,"Oh, no, this is a horrible CD. It don't care what other people call it but to me it sound like really bad rock & roll. HUGE MISTAKE buddy, leaving Guns n Roses. I was listening to it in my car and all I wanted to do was to go home and step on it and then blast some real Guns & Roses. If you want to buy Guns & Roses music, wait for their new release. What I miss the most is Axl's lyrics and carisma. Believe me."
4,Izzy on his own,"First I should say this CD is very unGNR-like. I bought this CD knowing that Izzy Stradlin was one of the better songwriters from GNR. He does not disappoint. He branches out in all kinds of styles. From the hard rock/reggae ""Pressure Drop"" to the slow ballad of ""How Will It Go"". If you're looking for a different sound, I would recommend this CD. Even if you are a hard core GNR fan, you should give this a try to follow up on Izzy and his sound. If you can appreciate an ecclectic sytle of music on one CD, give this a try. Too bad no one else supported Izzy's solo career as much as his GNR career."
4,Post GNR Work,"When Izzy left GNR I was a bit peaved. After all it was his blues-influenced rythmn guitar that sustained the sound of the band. Wether gloriously accompanying Slash's heavy guitar sound or Axl's incredible voice Izzy was a musical force to be reckoned with. And so when he left and joined up with the Ju Ju Hounds I was excited by the prospect. To me this album doesn't disappoint. If you like early Black Crowes, Johnny Lang or Stevie Ray Vaughn then you love this album. The single Shuffle It All is one of the best tracks but the album as a whole is solid. I really believe this is about 4 1/2 star quality. Give a listen."
4,Pure rock and roll,"This release has a very different sound from Guns N' Roses' brand of hard rock. Izzy Stradlin' and the Ju Ju Hounds sound more like The Black Crowes than GN'R. The difference between Black Crowes and Izzy is that Izzy includes some punk-sounding songs along with the rock and roll. Some of the highlights are Somebody Knocking and Shuffle it all, which got some MTV airplay for a while. Is a good work overall, but no for every Guns N' Roses fan. If you like Rolling Stones or Black Crowes, then you'll be pleased with this CD."
5,What a fellow crohnnie has to say,"I have read the book, ""Learning Sickness: A Year with Crohn's Disease by James M Lang.As a fellow crohnnie I found myself ""hooked"" on this book. It was hard to put it down.It has been a very long time since a book has done that to me. I have had crohn's disease now for about 13 years and have never in all these years been able to relate to a book about CD like I did with James Lang's story.Professor Lang, ""You took the word's right out of my mouth and you read my mind!""Need I say more?Yes. Jim wrote in chapter 6, the last paragraph, something that I have never been able to put into word's. Something I have always wanted to put into word's and never could. Professor Lang is creative, sensitive, and clever in his writing in this book.This is a book that every IBD patient will want their doctor to read!Lisa B."
1,Sorry to disagree...,"As a person who has struggled with Crohn's disease for years- I had hoped this book would offer some useful information. Instead, after buying it out of my now very meager income- I got to read some guy's diary about how he felt. It was not useful to me at all- except that it will hold the front door open to let the fresh air in. If you have Crohn's disease or suspect it- I beg you to read Jill Sklar's book or 'Straight from the gut'- both are available on Amazon and both are very, very helpful."
4,Great Price for A LOT of jimmies,"I used these to make Elmo cupcakes for my sons. They make great red fur when you cover the frosting with them. One much smaller jar at the local grocery was $8 and there weren't much better options at most online places. If you need a lot of these sprinkles for a project, these are perfect and for a great price."
1,jetsn,I was very disappointed. I felt like the item was a bait and switch. The item in the picture is NOT AT ALL like what I received. I contacted the seller and nothing was done. I wouldn't buy from this person again because I wouldn't know what I are getting. Thank you.
5,An amazing journey with Primo Levi,"An really good book. I read it immediately after his previous book (Survival in Auschwitz : The Nazi Assault on Humanity) and where the first one is extremely sad and depressing this second one is an incredible insight into the mixture of characters that Levi encounters on his way back from Auschwitz. Although set in a completely ruined Eastern Europe I found the book positive and intriguing to read. His friends the Greek, Cesare, il Moro etc. are all amazing characters to read about and his whole journey through the Russian bureaucracy is just as fascinating to experience as well."
4,Review,"Product came as advertised, but it took longer to ship than I was expecting. I still received the book in time though, and it came as advertised."
4,They're Slipping But The Album Still Has Heart,"The reunion piece from the boys of the self-confessed cookie-cutter band, Pulley, should ooze with unbridled energy, but unfortunately Radinsky's vocals just seem subdued and the rest is so immaculately produced it's often hard to make an emotional connection. The Ocean Song is the standout track of the album, most of the rest are adequately catchy, but there are some woefully tuneless songs in there too (History Repeats Itself, Leather Face). Radinsky's vocals skip between the unaccompanied sound of @#!* and the vocal layerings of Matters effectively, but his constant habit of overextending his notes at times grows tiresome. It seems Pulley have slipped even more into the realm of the ordinary with this album, but not for a lack of sincerity or as a result of selling out. When Radinsky claims, ""I don't write this music with intent to pay my bills,"" you can't help but believe him."
3,standard.,"Well, I'm not going to say this is a terrible cd because it's not. ""Hurray for Me"" and a few other songs save this album from that solid title. I would more less consider this album a mediocre cd. It's not anything to rush out and buy, but if you want a good pop-punk collection or something this will keep you entertained for a short while. Pulley has some good songwriting skills, but there are better pop-punk bands out there. So listen and judge for yourself, because you may think of it totally different than what I do. Once again, it's not a bad cd, it just seems like I haven't been really getting into it, but sometimes if my mood is right it's a masterpiece, but not too often. I found more satisfaction in an Alkaline Trio album than I did with this, so I recommend ""Goddamnit"" instead of this, that cd blows me away, but this was a cool breese."
2,Pulley not so good,Pulley would be a great band if the singer weren't so monotone. Check out Ten Foot Pole Unleashed or Insider instead. A much better band!
1,Rubber head author,"This is probably one of the few books I have read that goes totally in the wrong direction. In this book, he discusses the problems with traffic using the same frame that has been used the past 50 years ... V/C ratios and such. Nothing new here. The only value of this book is for those who want to understand exactly what is wrong with urban planning. This book is essentially a step-by-step guide on how to take the humanity out of urbanity."
4,Really cool collectable,"This toy is definatly a cool collectable! It's pretty big and could actually cover your face like in the movie(s). The legs are also a great feature, as they can be put into various positions and add some more life to it. My only complaint is that the item is quite pricey. But overall, it's great!"
4,Who needs Teddy Bears?,"Quite possibly the most unique & coolest 'stuffed animal' ever!On those cold rainy lonely nights every good colonist or marine needs some thing to snuggle up to, and this fits the bill perfectly! What is more comforting than your own personal facehugger? Fully articulated legs and tail ensure a proper grip, so there will be no escape!A must have for any Aliens fan."
4,If you love sorbets this is the book for you!,The sorbet recipes in this book are fabulous. They are very simple to follow and require very little special equipment. They are low fat and delicious. I wouldn't buy this book just for the ice cream recipes - there are just a few.
5,The Cat's Meow!,"I am a big ""Alice in Wonderland"" fan, and absolutely LOVE the Cheshire cat! So this item was perfect to add to my Wonderland collection! I love the expression on the Cheshire cat's face, and plus it glows in the dark! How cool is that?!"
2,This is cute but it doesn't fit well!,I LOVE the design of the Waverly Petite Rose collection - I bought it for my daughter's nursery. She is now a year old and the crib sheets (we bought several) are all TORN from just trying to get them over her standard sized crib mattress. I wish Waverly had a knit crib sheet instead that coordinated. I think I will go with that fabric the next time around.
4,"""You can DO it!""","Been using this video for exercise for about three weeks now. Being a polio survivor, I can't exercise standing up. This video is ideal for getting the old heart pumping. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the famous and not-so-famous people saying ""You can DO it!"" Thought that was totally patronizing (we post polio folks are funny that way). After you get used to this one, try ""Sit Tight"" by Richard Simmons also--it'll really get you going!"
3,Passable movie,"The movie requires a bit of a stretch, but would suffice on a long, rainy afternoon when there no other options."
5,Perhaps the perfect date movie...,"I really enjoyed Tristan + Isolde...in fact, much more than I thought I might.The performances were all excellent, especially those of James Franco, Rufus Sewell and the radiant Sophia Myles. The period details and production design were quite well-done. Best of all, the script dealt with such big themes as love, honor, duty and even redemption, but not in a heavy-handed fashion.I had recommended Tristan + Isolde to a friend who likes Jane Austen novels. The movie has that sort of grand, sweeping romanticism she would probably like coupled with enough sword fights and action scenes to keep the boys in the audience entertained as well...in other words, this is perhaps the perfect date movie."
2,visually beautiful,"This is probably the most visually beautiful movie I've ever seen. That said, the romantic triangle is much better known as part of the Arthurian legend, so there's little that's new. In fairness, this legend predates the Arthurian legend, but that doesn't negate the feeling that you've seen this done many times and much better. Worse, the lead actors have zero screen chemistry. As a result, I couldn't have cared less that they weren't together. My best friend and I had a moderate amount of fun watching this since we started making fun of the characters early in the film, but it wasn't a total waste. The redeeming quality is how utterly gorgeous the film looks."
2,Boring movie,"I am really suprised by all the glowing reviews of Tristan and Isolde. I thought the movie was very boring. I didn't think the movie was well written at all. I do like this type of movie but not this one.I think the fact that Tristan and Isolde loved each other but couldn't fully be together, because she ended up married to someone else seems like it would be interesting, but somehow is just fell short for me."
1,tristan & Isolde,DVD skipped scenes and the sound went out several places. I tried it in two different players. I mailed it back on 12/31/07 and still haven't heard anything from them (as of 01/16/08) I sent them an e-mail asking about it and haven't gotten a reply.
4,a bit slow,"A bit slow and tedious and not such great sound, but a great, classic story. You will enjoy."
3,"Decent Sword Movie, Average Love Story","For those interested in Tristan+Isolde, I think you'll porbably fall into two groups: the sword fighters, and the star-crossed lovers. The movie tries to satisfy both groups, and does so - barely. All in all, the movie is good, but not great. The action scenes are well done, so the sword fighters will be happy; and the love scenes are also adequate (not over the top, like I feared). The acting is also not as bad as I expected- although for about half the movie Tristan looks like he is fighting back tears, which will be annoying to the sword fighters. You could say that this was a movie I watched with low expectations that were just exceeded. The sword fighters will end the movie wanting more sword fighting, and the star crossed lovers will wonder why there was so much fighting in their movie. If you can live with that, then you'll like the film: it is a good compromise to settle the argument of 'his movie' or 'her movie'."
1,An insult to the honorable,"This movie is ok in its way, howver, those connected with it obviously have no concept of the meaning of honnor or duty and, if they have ever bothered to read the original romance understood nothing. Tristan in this version is spitefull, self-centered and mean spirited. He blames Isolde for the failure of his relationship and forces her to betray her husband, and the man who cared for him a a child. The mythical Tristan was a man of great honor and integrity, who put honor, loyalty and duty above all else. He did not betray his lord or his friends. King Mark of Cornwall in the legend wrongly suspected the couple of an illicit affair. Incidentally, the makers of this movie also call Tristan 'Traistan of Aragon' which is in Spain. He was actually from Lyonesse, which now lies beneath the English Channel."
3,Slow and uninvolving,"There are movies that merit running more than two hours, where the filmmakers fill every second with cinematic gold. Unfortunately, Tristan & Isolde isn't one of them. The movie drags from the beginning, as we see 20 to 30 minutes of background that could have been explained with some background text. Each scene, then and after, moves at a leisurely pace, as though people were not dying and nations were not at war.Worst of all, James Franco -- surely there were attractive young British actors that could have played Tristan -- seems to be sleepwalking through every scene with his co-star, bringing an abject lack of chemistry to the proceedings.This is a workman-like film, but it has really nothing to demand that the viewer watch it. A rental, and nothing more."
3,Good action,"This movie was a good movie for those who like medieval action. However, the love story was quite wooden. There's never a real connection between the two characters. Isolde seems like she's just looking for an escape out of her ordinary life. Tristan on the other hand is never really sure about his feelings for Isolde. There is ZERO passion in their relationship and the love scenes thus never reach anything remotely close to those of Romeo and Juliet.That aside, James Franco shows that he is a great actor by himself in a lead role. His conviction in his character and his role demands admiration. His character was believable and as he progresses through the movie, the audience can't help but root him on. Definitely worth a watch or two."
5,Unforgetable Love Story,I cannot stop watching this movie it is so good the best love story since titanic for me!!!
2,Hit the snooze button...,"This movie is cheesy and contrived. It consists of one worn out cliche after another, from beginning to end. The movie may be based on a beautiful story, but the screenplay is uninspired and forgettable. The only reason it even rises to the level of two stars is due to mildly acceptable performances by the actors, and some nice cinematography sprinkled in here and there. I paid $1 to see this flick at the local cheap theatre, and it was worth not one penny more. I found myself bored for the entire two hours. Thumbs down!"
3,Eh....,"Tristan and Isolde started out really, really well. I like this movie because Rufus Sewell is awesome and you kind of have to feel bad for him and I really like Sophia but I didn't see any chemistry. Its like one day they're just like ""oops..we're in love..."" and you're left scratching your head wondering ""when did this happen?"" I don't know if its how the movie was written or if James Franco is really bad in romantic movies. There is also more fighting and war than I'd like but its still a pretty good movie. Although, there were a few times my eyes welled up (thanks to Isolde) I think Rufus Sewell probably gives the best preformance."
5,Two willows entwined,"When the Romans pulled out of the English isle they left a power gap and a divided land that was ripe for the picking by the ruthless Irish. Growing up in this turmoil is Tristan. Left for dead he is nursed back to health by Isolde. Thy find each other only to be pulled apart by loyalty and duty.The story has many parallels to tales of King Arthur and other Celtic tales. It looks like a tad of Seigfreid was to send in also.Two outstanding things that make the film first class besides the story and cinematography (filmed in Ireland and Prague, Czech Republic) is the acting of Rufus Sewell and the music by Anne Dudley. People will want the soundtrack."
3,Entertaing but it tries to ahrd to be an epic,I enjoyed this film at times but not all of the movie was good. The acting was over the top and it was to big for this little movie. Then the movie tries to ahrd to be a big epic but it fails. But that dosent mean this film is entirelly bad it is pretty good overall. There are great action parts and the story is good. The romance is real and you feel the chemistry between the actors. Overall it's an ok film but they tried to ahrd to amke it good.
4,Slowly paced in parts,Yet this film was a good rendition of an ageless story of duty -v- love.James Franco does a passable job of the hero who is in love with one he is not meant to haveThe downside is some dialogue is a little unclear.
3,The Problem With the Romance...,"The problem with this romance is that King Marke is a far more admirable person than Tristan. Marke is noble, wise, brave, considerate, even a bit good looking. All Tristan has going for him is youth and studly good looks. He is sullen, soulfull, and more than a little bit obnoxious.So one wants to yell at the screen at Isolde, ""What are you thinking!""Of course if she had been sensible, the only tragedy would be Tristan eating his heart out somewhere on the Scottish Marches where he should have been sent--far away from Isolde."
1,Tristan and Isolde,"If you like swarmy soap operas, you may enjoy this movie. This was a terrible adaptation! The story of Tristan and Isolde is supposed to be about an anguised love that cannot be. At the very least, you are supposed to feel the couple's longing to be with each other. You can never feel this because the characters are rolling around the forest every five minutes. The tension of never being together isn't in this movie, because they ARE together all the time --which completely defeats the point of the story."
5,Beautiful,This is one of my favorite love stories. I didn't even mind the ending :) I fell in love with Tristan and Isolde from the beginning. For those of us who wonder if true love is real...this movie gives you hope. It didn't feel like a fairy tale to me. This story felt real to me and I appreciate that.
5,"""Every look he gives you, I get sicker and sicker. ""","Isolde-If things were different, if we lived in a world without duty, would you be with me?Tristan-That world does not exist.Isolde-I'll pretend it's you...This movie had be captured from the very beginning. I do not at all agree with reviews I have read about it not being a good love story and it making you roll your eyes. It was very good, good actors, good story. I would actually prefer this over a number of love stories, it's in my top 3 of them. And I have also read that it's not believable that they fell in love in just a few days, but what about Romeo and Juliet?..that was basically love at first sight. I am one of the most romantic saps you will ever meet and I am very judgemental about love stories. To me, along with Pride and Prejudice and Romeo and Juliet, this is one of the best love stories ever told."
3,A tepid take on classic love,"I am a total sucker for doomed, tragic love. That said, I was unimpressed by this movie. Depite some good acting, the main characters and shallow, self-centered and unlikable.It starts off somewhat promising. Tristan is injured and nursed back to health by the daughter of an enemy, Isolde. They fall in love.Then Tristan returns home. He is sent to retrieve Isolde as a bride for the foster father who loves him as a son. Does he tell a man who would give him anything in the world that he is in love? Nope. Does she tell him that his son and her are already lovers? Nope.Instead, they have her marry the father and start a cruel, needless affair. Tristan adores this man and yet lets his lover marry him and then sleeps with his father's wife? What a ^$$&.They both come across as weak and selfish.This movie made their love seem cruel and shallow instead of timeless and powerful.Pass. Giving this movie away."
2,Tony Robbins?,"I could not stand this book. It used verbs like it was going out of style. It tries to make you believe that you're about to embark upon an amazing adventure of learning where discoveries will lead to ultimate fulfillment and success :) . It's 75% fluff to make you believe that all life problems will be solved if only you could learn how to learn. It was like Anthony Robbins wrote it. Motivational B.S.. Some of it was good, if you siffed long enough you could get a couple gold flakes out of this one, that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of a deserving 1. But it was so anoying in how it was written. It was so bad I had a hard time paying attention. Awful motivational and persuasive [stuff]. Do waste you money buying this. ..."
5,Great Book of Poetry!!!!,This is definitely one of the best poetry books I have in possession. The cover art is beautiful to look at which is a plus for me. I highly recommend this book to poetry lovers.
4,Just the appetizer....,"Ok, this is just an EP based on tracks on the upcoming ""Cool to be You"" CD. I've been waiting what seems like forever for some new descendents/all music. The first 2 tracks, ""Nothing Like You"" and ""'Merican"" are great, and also, coincidentally, set to be released on the new cd. The bonus tracks, ""Here with Me"" and ""I Quit"" and the bonus instrumental track are just average, but leaves me wanting more. Overall, a great EP, however."
4,Head Like A Movie,"This CD is one of those underrated little gems that will borough it's way into your subconscious before you realize how much you really like it. For those unfamiliar, prime ""Head"" Dave Einmo is a veteran of fine Pacific NW bands Spyglass and Sushirobo. This ""concept"" album is inspired by Super 8 films shot by his parents in the 1970's. It's catchiness is almost a contradiction to the arty stance of the music, but it all works seamlessly without pretension. It's fun music any way you look at it, and I've been unable to get it out of my car since I got it. If you have the chance, see the band live. I saw them at Seattle's Crocodile Cafe last weekend and it was a brilliant show, deftly incorporating the old films as visual background to the songs. Eno would be proud. Here's hoping HLAK is more than a one-off project."
2,I wish I paid a third of the price!,"I've had this video for quite some time. This morning, I blew the dust off it and popped it in my VCR. I fast-forwarded to the dance portion and remembered why it's been sitting on my shelf for so long: it's annoying and not interesting. The dance is hard to follow because none of the girls in the video are in sync and it seems to be mostly walking from side to side while twisting your hips in akward ways. I found that I sweat more blasting music and dancing on my own without Donna's video. I don't really have an opinion on the kick and jab routine. It's definately better choreographed than the dance. (Although, I still prefer Billy Blanks.) However, I do really like the circuit toning. Despite her yelling, ""I got your back"" every five seconds, I like it. I felt the burn in my entire body and have noticed results. I would only recommend this video to someone who is looking to tone muscles; not lose weight. And thank goodness I have a mute button!"
3,Was hoping for better,I purchased the video because I liked the idea of three different twenty minute workouts on one tape. The cardio segment I didn't like. It was too hip hoppy with hard to follow dance steps. The kickboxing segment was ok; I have done a lot better. The weight trainig workout was the best. It worked the total body with an extra emphasis on the lower body with lunges and squats. This one unfortunately sits on my shelf with a lot of other unused workout videos I bought.
5,Lots of fun while working out!,"I really like the workouts and the fact that they are 20 mins long. I can rotate the different workouts and not get bored too quickly and then once I am ready for the advance workout, I do not need to buy the next tape, she already has the advance workout on the DVD. I definitely recommend this DVD for those who like to dance and get ""funky"" in their workouts!"
4,Pretty Good!,"After receiving my first Donna Richardson tape, 30 Days to Thinner Thighs, I knew I had to try more by this friendly, energetic, very personable instructor. My next tape was Four-Day Rotation; I do the entire tape for a wonderful, fun total body workout. Three-Day Rotation was my third purchase, and Donna still motivates me in her very friendly manner. What I DIDN'T like was that loud, obnoxious Asian-looking woman in the back of the class in the first section; I think she's in the back of the class in the last section as well, but in the second section - kickboxing - she's right up in your face. I began to wonder ""who's teaching this class"" as she whoops and hollers at her classmates to ""work it"" and ""keep it up"". ... as I'm huffing and puffing trying to keep up ... I wish I could mute her out, but keep the music and Donna's comments. I know I went on a bit about ""that woman"", but your ""classmates"" really do make or break your class enjoyment."
5,Fun and Funky Workout,"This three day rotation workout is great! You burn calories and have fun. It is a party that ends too soon. I love Donna's attitude. She is a motivator. I would use perky but she's laid back. The kickboxing routine has one girl that tends to interject a lot. That is a little distracting to meb but the workout is still very good. If you need a quixk workout that is effect for total body shaping, this is the way to go!"
4,Excellent Workout,"This was an excellent workout. I personally do not care for the dance aerobic workout. The other two are excellent. Using the kick boxing routine and the circuit toning, I have lost 50 pounds. Of course I was using Slim Fast and Weight Watchers as well but the circuit toning exercises really worked my abs; and the kick boxing worked my arms. This is an excellent dvd if you have the discipline to get up and do the workouts. You will definitely see results within two weeks (if you are doing it consistently- 3 to 5 days a week). Thanks Donna, my family and I love you!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good Beginner's Workout,"This workout was great for me, because I'm a beginner. But the DVD will remain useful for a long time because of its versatility. You can do anything from one basic workout (20 minutes) up to three advanced workouts (60 minutes). You do need a pair of dumb bells to do the toning workout. I wasn't sure I would like the kickboxing workout, but it turned out to be a lot of fun. My only problem was with the dance workout. I do not like funk and don't like having to sway my hips around. The other two workouts and the versatility of this DVD still make it well worth the $..."
5,Great - lost a dress size in a month,"I hadn't worked out for about 10 years. I worked out to the tape every weekday morning for a month. At the end of the month I looked great. I went from a size 16 to a 14 in pants, and could wear some dresses in a size 12. I had definition in my abs, legs, and arms. I was 50 years old, the workouts were challending in the beginning but got easier each day. Each one is a full body workout.Could it be better? Sure, but I haven't encountered a perfect one. If you are looking for a good workout, that you can stick with, try this one. Give yourself a month (five days a week) and you will get results. Just eat balanced meals. I didn't diet, just ate right.It's been two years, I've had surgery and regained the weight. Gonna start using this workout again, and I know I'll get the same results."
2,Super Bummed,"I was extremely excited to get this DVD. I have been working out with Tamilee Webb and Donna Richardson for years and was thrilled to find that Donna had some DVD's of her own. I really like her energy in the Platinum 2000 series and was looking forward to being motivated by her some more. I have to say I was super bummed after doing the 3 day rotation workout. Although Donna is great and her energy is, as always, super powered, the women in her class shouting and whooping it up and commenting constantly is both distracting and totally annoying. They are often so loud that I can't hear Donna's instructions and the whole thing is just way too over the top. If you want to get the benefit of Donna Richardson without all the annoying background chatter, I recommend you check her out, along with Tamilee Webb and Tracy York, in the Buns of Steel Platinum 2000 series."
3,Great idea but poor execution,"I bought this when I started exercising at home and hoped that the ""pick your routine"" option would really be cool. It's not. You have to have good exercise routines for that to work. The circuit training portion is a good workout, but I, as a real beginner, found none of the workouts to be vigorous AT ALL. They barely raised my heart rate at all and I much prefer my Denise Austin and Kathy SMith tapes. I think DVD is a great medium for workout videos, but this is not its best incarnation."
4,short and effective,"this video has 3 sections, each 20 minutes long, with their own warm-ups and cool-downs. the toning section is good, though you won't always break a sweat. it does a good job firming up most of your body. the kick and jab will definitely get you sweating, though she probably doesn't really know what she's doing, and the whole ""i've got your back"" thing is redundant and kind of annoying. i just try and ignore it when she says that. as for the dance section, i watched it once and that was enough. too low-impact for me, but if you're a beginner, you might like it. i only use the first 2 sections, but i think they're great."
3,donna rocks,"I really enjoy Donna Richardson's workout routines. She's fun, energetic and informative in her workouts. While I love this video, I'm not a huge advocate of the 3 section workouts being so brief and would prefer longer cardio sections. To get maximum benefits, I need to do two sections and fast-forward past the next warmup to get enough cardio in. The pros of this video is that these are no nonsense, 'get results' types of moves, which are executed in proper form. For a beginner this is an excellent video that is well rounded. By incorporating her 'dance aerobics', a nice cardio section that seems less like exercise and thereby makes it seems effortless, she makes this segment a fun fat burner."
4,Donna Richardson: 3 day rotation 2000,"Donna has three 20 minute workouts. They are fun, easy to learn, and get your blood pumping. Her group is real loud and always cheering! She has kickboxing, circuit toning, or funky dance moves to choose from. You can also do these three routines with just her on an advanced level. Her cool down is a bit rushed. She goes through the stretches quickly.Donna is real smiley and pumped up and funky."
5,Awesome workout!,"All 3 of the segments (rather done together or independently) give you a great workout and best of all they allow for a workout between 20 and 60 minutes! In 20 minutes you can get your heart pumping and start feeling good without having to sacrifice too much time. I alternate between 20 and 40 minutes workouts on this DVD and some of the other videos in my collection (Denise Austin, Jane Fonda, Tae Bo...). None of them work it like Donna Richardson though!"
3,I liked 1 out of 3 of the segments.,"I am not much of an excerciser, so you would consider me a beginner. I bought this video because of the flexibility of doing one of the 20 minute segments at a time. The first night I fast forwarded to the cardio-kickboxing segment. I liked it a lot and found that it really got my heart beating and me sweating! The next day I did the dance-aerobic part. It was not for me. The moves were more about looking ""smooth"" than actually getting a workout. Donna also continued to say ""I've got your back"", which is kind of weird considering she isn't in my family room excercising with me. Last night I did the toning segment. It was OK, but I didn't feel like she concentrated on my arms very much. Overall, I would recommend this video to someone who has other videos in their library to choose from as well."
3,Big Cheesy Grin,"This is a fun, hig-energy, bouncy work out with a very smiley bunch of gals! I love that you can rotate workouts for Mon, Tues + Wednesday. I really love the mambo workout. However on the down side you have to learn very fast to keep up with the dance moves and when it comes to the stretches just keep the remote control handy to keep pausing it to actually have time to stretch."
2,"less banter, more instruction!","While I enjoyed Donna Richardson's ""enthusiatic"" contributions on the Buns of Steel Platinum series, this video was an overdose of such. On this DVD, I enjoyed the Dance Aerobics and the Kickboxing sections to a certain extent but there is way too much distracting banter going on in the background. The Kickboxing section definitly needs more instruction on the proper excution of the moves and less kidding around. If Donna decides to do a series where she concentrates more on serious instruction, I would definitly buy it. Her moves are great but lets get serious!"
2,No workout here,"This one was a huge disappointment. The cardio was funky but not fun, and won't do anything for your heartrate. The cuing is poor, especially with the kickboxing, where she just goes right into a move. The weight portion wasn't bad, but there are better tapes out there. I really regret buying this one."
1,Not for me,"I hated this video. Sorry to say. The people in it were annoying. I couldn't focus they were so annoying and overly into it. I prefer the Minna workouts or Tami ones, but these, too many people and they were all annoying!"
4,Good Product.,"Easy to install, good fastener system to secure to wall, just followed instructions. Easy to use, looks good. Visitors comment on how well it looks."
2,Broken after two days.,"We gave this net to our seven year old for his birthday. He loves catching bugs. The second time he played with it, the pole snapped in half. He wasn't playing super roughly with it - just trying to catch some bugs. I bought a net at a local dollar store that lasted for a couple months. I was expecting more durability from this."
2,Butterfly Net Reviewed,"Just your basic butterfly net for a small child. Nothing fancy, a good place to start, but not to stop."
5,Great and comprehensive book for small business!,"As a professional web developer, I wish every one of my new customers would read this book BEFORE they begin the web planning process with me. Web Savvy offers basic information that helps people get some solid footing before they step off into the unknown. Yes, it's really basic stuff -- just exactly that. You get a better feel for what content/text/graphics will help your site become truly functional and useful to your visitors; and you find out how to plan a basic but effectivemarketing plan. Web Savvy is absolutely the place to begin the process!"
1,didnt work on my 360,i dont know how good it is b/c i couldnt play it. I think that the user should have put on the description that it doesnt work on the 360
3,Not for x-Box 360,"I bought this game as a X-mass gift for my brother, to my surprise it was no for X-Box 360, is for the old x-box. I returned immediately, don't really know how god or bad is it."
4,Kids will luv it,"The game came fast, My kids have been asking for Dragon Ball, the game had good reviews, its an older game but the kids will still enjoy it."
2,"Ok, but not particularly good","I bought this CD for 2 reasons: Black coffee and Pure Shores. These are the 2 songs I had heard on the radio and I liked, and hoped that the rest of the CD would be good too. Not really. In fact, I never heard any other song from this CD being played on the radio here in Europe. William Orbit does bring an interesting bit to the sound of these songs, but the girls really don't stand out as talented. Though they all have ok voices, none of them has a particularly nice nor powerful voice, and the text is girly in a shallow way: what artist would make an entire song around the chorus ""I know that you want a piece of my a**""??"
3,Its OK,"Hey,i got this really cheap by ordering it used from Amazon UK. But basically, i wanted to listen to Black Coffee while driving around LA. Black Coffee being Classic pop in the best sense of the word. My taste do not gravitate to vocal groups usually. Its easy to say and probably true that the Brit girls are not as soulful as their American opposite numbers, But at least they don't thank Jesus every other song once they become successful. Pure lovely sounding voices all the way through with a lot less cringes than you would think not to mention at least two or three non hits that are really great pop tunes. Sure you'll yawn when yet another girl group sings about having their own cash, big deal you got a job, but there is some good stuff on here. Very Prince like in production.cheers"
4,Instructional DVD for learning about how to check-out your PPG,"Interesting for the beginner...a lot of detail on ""how to"", not too interesting for the more advanced."
1,Gun Crazy aka A Talent for Loving,"Unfortunately I purchase the cheapest of the four videos available and was disappointed in the quality that I received. It appeared to have been copied, or merely was just so old (1969) that it should have been marked as POOR QUALITY. I would not have purchased it. It was misrepresented by the seller, daisy899."
2,"Bach:Organ Spectacular (DVD Audio), Ton Koopman","Ton Koopman has undeniable skills at the keyboard. However, as a European virtuoso he surely should know that one must take the acoustic of the environment into consideration. He plays everything on the disk at a pace too rapid for the reverberant room. The recording is OK, but not any better than a standard CD. In fact, if you want great Bach, on a terrific organ, and wonderfully remastered on CD, get ""Great Organ Favorites"", E. Power Biggs on the Harvard Folentropp organ, recorded about 1960!Unless you need to have multiple Bach recordings, skip this one."
1,I would not buy this title,"I bought this DVD-Audio title based on recommendations from Sound and Vision magazine. I wanted to hear this great version of the Toccata and Fugue. The sound is ok...the playing is not. It started off the with the first few notes. He adds trills to the notes where they are not written that way. It does not get better from there. The playing is rushed, muddy, and with no passion. Compare this to my favorite version by Peter Hurford (Toccata and Fugue, Great Organ works on London records) and there is no comparsion."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,I expected a much more detailed and extensive coverage of Taekwondo moves. The tape is a mere forty minutes long and is to say the least lacking anything different or inventive that black belts don't already know. I was very disappointed.
3,PIAA H3's are just ok,"I had the Sylvania SilverStar H3's and they kept blowing out, these PIAAs are exactly the same color and lasted about 2 years, one just blew out. Now I have one Sylvania and one PIAA and like I said they are the same color and brightness, I can't tell a difference. They both are ""whiter"" than stock but barely any blue color in them. These PIAAs are way over priced, the Sylvanias were half the price but agian they only lasted 1/3 of the life.I recommend the Osram Nightbreaker H3 bulbs or Philips eXtreme power bulbs. These are real quality bulbs."
3,okay,They are bright but seem to burn out to often. i only use in morning or late at night. I think PIAA should try a little harder on making this bulb last longer.I have PIAA headlight bulbs on my truck and they work great.
2,Xtreme White,"The product was in good condition, but the color is not that I expected, the Title says. ""Extreme white"" but is the same color that the normal bulbs"
4,Worth the Search,"It used to be that one who simply reads history for fun might shy away from out-of-print books, thinking the writing style might not be as compelling as that of more modern authors.No so here. The original copyright was 1947 and the copy I found was a 1970 reprint.This is readable, concise, and tells the story of Alexander I with the level voice of someone truly interested in his subject. The bibliography is superb.A nice little addition to one's library."
5,great item,great item great songs good music we like the cd we will shop again in your store for more itemsthanks again
4,Fun & Fresh,"Love Match is first and foremost a fun read. Not your typical ""women's lit,"" this novel combines romance and intrigue in a refreshing setting: a tennis tournament. Abbigail Arden, the main character and first-person narrator, charms her way through the pages of this book with wit, determination, and honesty. Her expressions are funny and unusual enough to make the reader laugh aloud. Perhaps more importantly, Abbie sets an example for anyone who has ever been apprehensive about taking a big step or making a change (and who hasn't?). This book is a perfect choice for taking your mind off of something, relaxing at the end of the day, passing the time while traveling, or just trying something new and different."
5,The best contemporary jazz CD ever!,"This multiple Grammy-nominated CD is my all-time favorite contemporary jazz CD. A beautifully orchestrated and virtuosically performed selection of covers along with brilliant completely original material. I am in awe of Paul Peress's musicianship in arranging, composing, producing, and playing on this CD. He is a giant of contemporary jazz."
3,...,It wasn't as good as I expected. 'Kiss The Rain' is still the best track...I think Myers needs to expand her horizon lyrically before she can be considered an amazing artist. Still good though.
4,The voice makes the music,"I actually don't have the album, but I do have the single for ""Kiss the Rain"", which also includes ""The Shark and the Mermaid"". Anyway, since I do have the single, I wanted to say a bit about it. The husky voice does indeed make the music. It seems like the best female vocalists have some power behind their voices and Billie Myers certainly does. ""The Shark and the Mermaid"" is not as strong, but it does have kind of a cool story in it. Billie Myers is an excellent vocalist, hopefully I'll get a chance to listen to the rest of her material."
3,CAN'T PLAY ON REGULAR EQUIP,"I love the music, she is so talented. I had purchased this CD years ago, and lost it. I searched hard to find it again and was happy when I found it, but that quickly changed when I received it and it can only play on my husbands surround sound system. It won't play in my truck or on any of my players."
3,I like the first song...,Well i only like one song off the whole CD unfortunately. Bought it for my girlfriend and she agrees... only good track is Kiss the Rain. In my opinion of course.
2,only a couple good songs,"There are maybe 2 good songs on the whole cd, Kiss the Rain being the most recognizable and popluar in its day. All of the other songs are so similar and repetitive they make you wish you were listening to something else. Too bad you can't just buy the single of ""Kiss the Rain."""
2,"If You Can't Figure Out the Plot Hole Inherent to the Premise in Six Minutes, You'll Probably Enjoy This","If however, you're like me, and saw the gaping, gaping, enormously distracting plot hole that completely undermines the premise of the film when it was first introduced (before the opening credits) you'll probably not be able to enjoy this film at all."
5,An amazing surprise!,"When I picked this movie off of Netflix instant play, I wasn't expecting much. Another cheap cheesy movie about a desperate girl trying to find a boyfriend before her biological clock self-exploded. What I got was an honest to goodness heartfelt love story that, even with the fictional aspect of the timer, was entirely believable and a joy to watch. The writing is amazing with jokes that are subtle enough to feel real and unscripted, but that still have you laughing out loud. The cast is perfect and the acting is very well done. Music and camera work were smooth and seamless, never distracting from the story. Best of all, it really does make you think 'What if?' and every time I watch I watch the movie I stop to think what it would be like if the timers were real.To sum it up, this movie is perfection! I've watched it a dozen times and will watch it a dozen more, without a doubt."
3,Cute,"Cute movie and an interesting look at differing approaches to the single life. And Emma Caulfield is definitely still a cutie although it was a kinda hard to believe her as a 29 y/o (and I'm a fan). If you rent, try to get past the first 15-20 minutes or so. It may have just been me but the movie seems to get better after a little bit of a slow start. Nothing exciting but still worth watching when you have to pick a chick flick. Although be prepared for some comments on the ""biological clock"" issue... ***1/2 (3.5 Stars)"
4,"Great movie, good features","Timer is an excellent romantic comedy - funny, witty, and makes you feel for the characters. Very real in terms of how relationships are handled, and a great fantasy in terms of what may happen if the Timer existed.The bonus features are decent - some outtakes and deleted scenes. The commentary is very good - the writer/director gives great insight as to her motivations behind writing the film, and has good behind the scenes info."
3,"Great premise, mediocre presentation","Lots of interesting ideas, but I think there are way too many logical holes.Also, is TiMER promoting the fact that there's only one? I think the message behind this film got mixed up.Lastly, aside from the main actress and her sister and her mother, none of the actors were compelling.And yeah, just a lot of ""explanations"", not a lot of acting.And since when does love = sex?The dialogue felt flat too when mediocre actors were reciting it (ie: the main guy in the movie. agh. you WANT to like him b/c he's a cool rocker dude drummer who's sensitive.. but really, let's not kid ourselves. he was awful.)"
2,Good stories but not much more than that.,I have to honestly say that this is a quaint little book that's basically a compiled list of one lady's experiences with ghosts. It's entertaining at times but I honestly expected much more. Overall I was pretty dissatisfied. If you get it as a gift then consider reading it but I'm not sure I would drop my own money on this title.
1,Mindless Garbage,"I am a musician and a huge fan of contemporary music, always looking to broaden my horizons. This Cd is not going to broaden anything except a desire to turn it off, especially Edwin Duggers random and mindless composition, if you could call it that, at the end. Do not buy this cd."
5,Great experience!,"The book arrived on time and in GREAT condition. I don't remember exactly how long it took to arrive, but I used standard shipping and got it in about a week to a week and a half. It doesn't look used at all. I actually had to re-check my order form because I thought I might have unintentionally bought a new one. All in all, I would definately use this seller again."
4,Almost there,"It needed a hundred more pages, particularly in the begining when he was contrasting Liberalism and Republicanism at the theoretical level. Because of the brevety of the treatment of the subject he seemed to over implify some very fundanental issues. Further, I disagree with the conclusion he seems to imply that Holmesian jurisprudence created a basis for contemporary liberalism. It certainly seems to me that, although some of Holmes' work is liberal, the ""Lochner"" jurisprudence that he was reacting against represented true liberal (in the libertarian sense) orthodoxy, and that the likes of John Harlan (which he views as representing republican values) posited the more exspansive view of liberalism. All in all this is a good book, It just needed a little more development."
2,"Overall, a poor showing.","If this book were a pocket hand, it would be a 9-6 unsuited - not the worst, but far, far from the best.If you take one thing from this book, it'll be the fact that the World Poker Tour (WPT) is on the Travel Channel every Wednesday night. Why? Because Sexton, one of the hosts of WPT, never ceases to remind the reader of this fact - to the point of it being annoying. While the book provides a decent overview of strategies for No Limit play, he covers key factors such as calculating the odds and pot-odds in as few as 2 1/2 pages. In all, that's what's frustrating - the book barely scratches the surface. It hints at other information that might prove helpful in No Limit, then tries to explain it away in 2 paragraphs."
5,beautiful jacket,"I took a chance, not believing the low price. The jacket is beautiful in construction and fit, and wonderfully warm. Thanks!"
4,"Nice, especially for price","This jacket is nice. The fit is perfect, true to size, it looks good but the color is a bit different than pictured. I got the 'summer berry' but I would definitely call it orange. There's not much 'berry' about it. As for the fabric, I agree it's not as soft or luxurious as you'd expect from cashmere but that's about all I can complain about."
3,Underwhelmed,"The fabric on this jacket is actually quite coarse. I prefer a slightly longer jacket and this one only came to right above my hips. There is almost no tailoring to it, and so if you have any waist at all it will feel baggy.The color is very nice, but I have yet to wear it and I've had it for almost 6 months."
5,Frikinterrrific Baby,"I wedged it in between ""Spine of God"" and ""Dopes"", it fit nicely. Thank you for the purity boys!"
5,Music on a Monster Scale,"Sandwiched somewhere between Superjudge and Dopes to Inifinity, Monolithic Baby is fast becoming my favorite Monster Magnet record. I was skeptical at first, due to Wyndorf's experimentation on God Says No, but after first listen my doubts were laid to rest. Unbroken is so catchy it should be in heavy rotation on hard rock radio, but it won't be. If ever there was a band that deserved to be a household name, it's Monster Magnet. Although, and call me selfish, I'm glad they're not. I've been a fan since Superjudge came out and believe me when I say that this record is simply great. Buy it now!"
1,A Disorganized Jumble Of Disconnected Thoughts.,"Please, please, do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. I was so excited to read it, then after 50 pages, I was so excited to throw it away. I just threw it in the trash.The book is just a bunch of disconnected thoughts with no organization, no style, no interesting revelations, no coherent,readable paragraphs. The fact that this book's editor let it get published means the editor needs to be replaced. - You want to read a good book you can't put down, read 'Complexity'."
4,Useful introduction to systems thinking,"I was delighted by the initial sections of the book - the first time I have seen 'systems thinking' properly defined, and also a very useful sketch of the historical development of these ideas. I will therefore be recommending it to my students - it really is a useful book. But do I agree with it? I think the whole thesis falls down in the application to ecosystems; here the evidence gets really shaky and I wasn't convinced."
5,"Key ""Thinker"" of the next century","What many of us are discovering is that the world was created from a select number of basic patterns and a random generator to make zillions of distinctions. That means that the world of science can be applied to the world of business, the world of art, etc., because there are underlying models which are similar. If you assemble the predominant thinkers leading the way to helping us all to find the ""keys"" of the patterns, Capra would be one of them. His earlier tome, ""The Turning Point"" is a good companion to the work he has continued here. Don't bother, however, with ""Belonging to the Universe"" (at least not for this type of research)."
3,Web of Life a Little Bit Tangled,"I admire the intent of The Web of Life, but the outcome is a bit messy and confusing. Although the content and ideas Capra writes about are very important, and I agree with about 90 percent of what he says, the way it is stated is very confusing and not well-written in most parts. A comprehensive knowledge of the sciences is required before making sense of this book, and even if you possess that, it still is not very clear. Only recommended for those willing to wade through some murky text."
3,"Basically, a synopsis of history. No original thinking here.","If one is interested in a long chronology of how systems thinking developed, this book is for them. If you are looking for new insights from a recognized thought leader, choose one of his other books."
3,This is not for the leisure reader...,"I had to read this book for a class that I was enrolled in. This book is really tough to get through. Jam packed full of interesting views, some parts I had to read twice just so that I could comprehend the subject. This isn't a book that I would have chosen to read on my own."
5,It is obne of the best ones,"I need to find this book of Capra in spanish. Would you please help me? Thanks,"
3,"Worth a listen, but not for everyone","Mindstrip by Suicide Commando is raw electro-industrial with heavily distorted vocals. Most of the tracks on here are slow and angry with the heavy, banging bass that is immediately recognizable as Suicide Commando. The strongest track has to be Hell Raiser, and it's the main reason why I got this album. None of the songs are very fast, and even though the lyrics are fairly good, I've heard better from other bands of the same genre. Also, some of the samples seem muffled in spots and often the keyboard synths in the backround are overshadowed by other sounds more than they seem they should be. However, if you're in the mood for the slower, more harsh type of industrial, Mindstrip is still a good choice. It's one of Suicide Commando's better albums."
4,"Good lights, short life","I really liked these lights while they lasted. These are not obnoxiously blue or bright, they're not yellow but an excellent white.They only lasted 2 years & 3 months which from previous reviews, appears to be normal but I expect longer life, hence the 4 stars."
3,lights are not a much brighter,"I had before a classic halogen Phillips and they had much light output power. Don't know why. I have check voltage. Alternator and all electrical components and they are ok. So for me, is not what I was expecting."
2,Bulb is not pure white,"When i have installed the Bulb after that I came to know that its not pure white, so I am disappointed with the description which that product has saying XTREME WHITE :( which is not really. its bit yellow."
3,Great Bulb Very Short Life,"Great light. Burned out in 13 months. First the left then the right 3 weeks later. Will not buy again. I will try another brand. Honda's original bulbs were 5 years old and worked fine. Live way out of the city and wanted more light. Got the light, but they are hard to change and costly so burning out in 13 months is unacceptable."
5,Bright!,Purchased a pair of PIAA white's in 1999 for a 1997 Acura. That pair are still on the same car and working like new and much brighter than the OEM. Bought a new car (Toyota) and was not happy with the OEM's. Dealt with it for a year and finally bought these PIAA's. HUGE improvement! No more yellow! They have a slight hint of blue which is what I wanted (looks more of a crisp white). I did not want to look too fake/blue like you see often. These are amazing and worth the $. Shipping was so fast with my prime membership :-)
4,Great product,"The light output is better than the stock bulbs. The blue hue from these bulbs in the reflector bowl looks neat also. Depending on the life span, I would buy these again."
2,Not bright enough,"To my surprise these bulbs are not very bright. Unfortunately this is true. If I knew that it's that bad I'd keep using the German ones from the local W/Mart, much cheaper and even little brighter."
4,Good quality but could be brighter,"Overall build quality appears to be good, and yes they are brighter than your standard bulbs, however that being said I thought that they would be more noticeably brighter than they are."
5,Xtreme White > Silverstar Ultra,"White is nice and crisp, without the blue/purple tint (although you can kinda see the blue lens reflected off the headlight). Output is awesome, would recommend."
4,Brighter than stock.,"Slightly brighter than a stock H4. A nice upgrade if you have an aftermarket lamp. And on a side note, make sure you wear gloves when you install them. All these people saying the don't last.. id bet they had their oily palms all over the bulb."
3,Costly and no brighter,"These units are no brighter than the 8500K ""EuroDeZigns"" I have purchased numerous times for different vehicles from various vendors on EBay for $10-$15 a set and have a lifetime replacement policy directly from the manufacturer. I have received replacement bulbs quickly at no charge from EuroDeZigns. Thus you could purchase 3 sets of EuroDeZigns for 1 set of the $50+ PIAA and have a lifetime warranty as well. I thought because of the PIAA name I would achieve a brighter bulb but these are no brighter and do not include a comparable warranty. This is a $50 lesson."
1,Still can't get it to work,"I should've believed what others had written about this expensive doorstop. I have never been able to get the pump to prime, thus have never been able to paint a thing. I'm painting for personal use, not for professional, and therefore have use of this item on weekends, when Campbell Hausfeld's customer service is not available. I'm REALLY not happy with this waste of money, but short of bringing the unit to work with me and trying to get CH customer support on the phone at my office, I don't know how I'm going to get any use out of this. The VP's around me will be thrilled with the sound of a compressor motor coming from my office, don't you think?"
4,review house painter,The product do the job better than expected.Instuction was easy to follow.Make the job go faster than expected
3,Important non-documented tip!,"The sprayer works quite well--be forwarned: you go through *a lot* of paint--if you think you need a gallon, get two.But **most important**--spray at the lowest acceptable pressure, and when you are not spraying, even for a minute to rearrange your spray area, switch the dial to prime. This bleeds the pressure out of the system. If you don't do this, you can wear out the prime spray valve very quickly--I know :-( It's not an expensive repair, but generally getting these things fixed is a matter of weeks, not days.4 stars for when it works, 1 star deducted for the poor documentation."
4,House Painter,"Painter worked great. It primed easy once I followed the tips that were included. It painted fast and cleaned easy. I used it to put 4 coats of paint on a 1500 sq-ft basement. My only complaint is that the paint spattered each time I sqeezed the trigger. I ended up rolling as I painted the first two coats to blend in the big drops. I e-mailed Campbell Hausfield and got a quick first response, but they haven't replied since I gave them the info they requested. It seemed to perform the same whether the gun filter was clogged or clean. The paint was interior latex primer and satin finish. Both paints were unthinned and both spattered the same. I think the whole problem is in the gun, probably the wrong size tip."
1,stay away,"Have had trouble with this out of the box, difficulty priming, won't hold pressure. I had a good full day last weekend (when it works, it's great), thought I'd figured out how to squeeze some work out of this thing, but in the middle of staining it lost pressure. Motor sounds good, but the hydraulic system won't 'click' to pressurize the system. Took it apart, checked the oil level, all the actions in the troubleshooting, no good. Good weather and nothing getting done, wish I'd spent a little more $ and gotten something more reliable."
4,House Painter,"It's great for outdoor painting. Spray sorda goes everywhere. I was hoping to use it for interior as well, but think I'd have to tape off and run plastic everywhere as the sprayoverage would get on everything."
4,beware the reconditioned units,"My husband bought a reconditioned unit on ebay. Attempted to use it the first week of arrival. The motor would not run, only hum. 90 day warranty covered the motor replacement but he had to paint the room by hand. Several choice words were used to express the frustration. It sat for two years in our basement with the new motor. Used it for 20 minutes and it stopped spraying - no pressure. He found a pool of oil at the base of the unit. Tore it apart, found a loose bolt. Tightened, refilled with oil and it ran great after that. Put two gallons of paint through it with no problems, no oil leaks, etc. Very poor Quality Assurance program. Nice product once he got the bugs worked out. Use the sprayer before the warranty runs out!!"
3,Not good but not bad,This is perfect for outdoor use. If used indoors be prepared for over spray. Clean up of the equipment takes time and the unit is rather noisy. The power plug on the unit is very short so an extension is a must.
1,Did not work coming out of the box,"After researching this product, I purchased it. Received it and took it out to use it and it would not work. After fiddling some, I called the 800 number. They asked me the usual questions (Is it plugged in, pain in the bucket, etc.) Finally had me take it apart and loosen a ball bearing. They said they were having a problem with the ball bearing from the factory and got a lot of these calls. After loosening the ball, it worked great. Cleaned it up and put it away. A couple of months later, got it out to use it again. It won't work again. Now the screws are stripped so I can't get to the ball bearing and fix it again. Buy one at your own risk. If it doesn't work new out of the box and they know they are having that problem and don't fix it, I would be wary."
5,Completely Satisfied,"I wanted to buy the Wagner Painter at first untill I read the reviews at Amazon's web site, they quickly changed my mind.I purchase EZ5000 from amazon.com after checking prices it was the best buy with free shipping, I ordered it Friday and it was here the following Wednesday. The discharge check valve was stuck ,which is common from pretesting of unit the only thing I think they should supply is a swivel for the spray gun, the hose is stiff and the swivel allows you to keep the gun pointing in the right direction and if you have to spray low you can easily turn gun upside down, it will save your wrist and arm.PAT GALLAGHER"
3,"I Mean, I Liked It But I Was A Little Lost...","Official Disclaimer: I happen to know this author, have spent time with him, went to his wedding etc.That having been said, I enjoyed the book and I am looking forward to the other two. I paid absolutely no attention to the dates, only to find out based on the other reviews that this is am important detail. How it's important, I don't know and I haven't asked him either. I thought it was distracting to the plot and characters, so I blew it off. Sue me.It is a little more political than I'd like, but not overly so. It had an awkward love scence that I hope is not repeated (Sorry Phil) and if it has to be repeated, maybe with more panache. Other that that one scene it was a good book and made me glad I picked up book two so I could continue the story. Looking forward to more."
1,"Excellent, but with a significant catch...","First let me say, when I first picked up this book, I thought it was one of the finest Forgotten Realms branded books to come out it years. I had been reading fantasy for 10 years, and this was one of the best that had that unfortunate company brand upon it. The plot was excellent, the characters interesting...Until I read ""The Fountainhead"", by Ayn Rand.This series is virtually the EXACT SAME thing! Honestly, the similarities are astounding...Ivar Devorast IS Howard Roark in a tunic. There is a scene that is grotesque in its slavish devotion to Rand's original: where Phyrea meets Devorast = where Dominique meets Roark.So, while Athans is excellent, the sheer disgust I now feel at his blatant crime is overwhelming. If ""The Fountainhead"" set in the Forgotten Realms sounds appealing, by all means go ahead, he does a splendid job of adapting and simplifying the tale to the setting...but know that he adapted, he did not create."
3,the fountainhead in the forgotten realms,"i am only halfway through this book, but as another poster pointed out, anybody who's read the fountainhead will recognize that this book owes heavily to it. there are at least 7 characters from the fountainhead that are transplanted directly to this book, with near identical physical descriptions, occupations and relationships between the 7 characters. so i guess i would have appreciated if there had been some kind of disclaimer before hand about what i was reading. but i don't know how these things work in the legal and the book world, but i feel like i am reading a story i've already read before in a different setting, and it is obviously prejudicial to my continued enjoyment of the story which otherwise might seem quite good."
3,To chaotic,"This book has a flow that doesn't seem to generate a continued interest. Every chapter doesn't neccesarily follow exactly the chapter previous(and each is only pages long). The concept is novel and the writing good, but just as I got into a section it was over.A book with a better flow to it is one that I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
1,so much promise lost,"Whisper of Waves (Forgotten Realms: Watercourse Trilogy Book 1)sadly the book seemed to have so much promise. but in about the middle of the book it just fell apart. objectivism is not my cup of tea, and it just pains me to read the appearant randroid writing incorperated into a novel for the forgotten realms. i say stick to editing philip its what you do best, stop writing books. it was the war of the spider queen series that i also stopped reading right at book 5. from now on i will steer clear of philips books and i hope he knows , if someone doesnt want to publish your randroid points of view then dont try to sneak it in the backdoor in your books, thanks. another writer on my do not read list."
5,BARING ONE'S SOUL,"I once read where to be a successful actor one must be so uninhibited that they would be able to go out on stage completely naked. I would never wish that fate on Rick Hamlin but he has shown us that he has what it takes to be a great writer: he is willing and able to bare his own soul. Keep on writing, Rick, (acting, singing). We'll be listening. You've got what it takes!"
3,maybe too old?,I was hooked to this product a couple of years ago and was so disappointed when it was discontinued. I've been searching for a like product since so i was so excited to see it on Amazon. What a disappointment - it is runny! I think it has exceeded it's shelf life.
3,Nice snips,"Having used the Reds for years to cut 20, 18 and 16 gauge studs and track the new blues I thought might cut nicer or work a little better.The only thing I can say at this point is they are twice the cost and cut just as good as the reds.So I gave them 3 stars because unless they last twice as long I won't know how much better they are than the reds..."
2,Muy pequeño,Me lo imaginaba el doble del tamaño real. Fue la única decepción que me lleve con este producto. De resto me pareció excelente.
2,Nigel Davies: Please! stop writing opening books!,"lets summarize the technique:-get all the grunfeld books-review the main lines and what kasparov and kramnik are playing-make few conclusive or thoughtful statements-when you do make a statement, give very vague varaiations so people are left wondering, did he really think this was okay or did he miss this move?specific variations: 7.bc4 in the exchange variation after 7...c5 8.ne2 nc6 9.be3 0-0 davies forgets 10.Rc1 and only lists 10.0-0 for white, not even mentioning the h4 idea.I could list probably five more without thinking, but its not worth the time.It may be the newest book, but dont bother, get rowsons book, he at least thinks before he writes."
2,T-shirt thing,"This product worked well enough for its price. It didnt have too many options, but if you're looking for a cheap way to make shirts, this will do."
5,The Kings Rule!,"This cd reminds me of a time when music as much about songs as it is now about a sound or look. For Granted and Love is Always Growing (#1 and #2) are the best songs, but #5 Falling Down is a keeper too. The only weak spot is the last song IMHO. They sound a little like U2, with some Cult and INXS mixed in. It's a grab bag of early 80's influence presented in a 2K kind of way. I will definitely purchase their new cd when it comes out."
3,Pretty Candle,I like the main candle but the 2 small candles are plain. I'm not sure the set is worth the price but it's hard to find beach themed unity candles that look classy so if that's what you are looking for then it's an easy fix amongst many not so easy wedding tasks.
3,Pastoral Care in Context Review,"Rather technical for some folks. Seems geared to those interested in higher degree programs. In this respect, however, it is guite good."
2,pastoral care in context,"over the head, to many other peoples veiws not enough of his and biblical veiws"
5,"Looks good, fits better",This bracelet is deep blue in color and the fit is perfect because of the stretch. Sometimes a bracelet won't fit a small wrist and falls off; not this one.
4,denim blue in color,"ok bracelet, but not as blue as I was hoping for. For the price worth it for blue jeans.. not dressy."
5,Excellent book to change your prospective on prayer,"Dr. Elmore and Dr. Hull have written an excellent, thought provoking book on how we pray. It's not by repetition or eloquent wording, it's what God sees in our heart and soul. The authors share many examples from both real life and from the Bible about how to prayer effectively. I am re-reading it for the second time in a month."
3,Not what it could've been,"I would have preferred that if the author was wanting to refute some of legendary happenings attached to J.H. ""Doc"" Holliday that she would have done so to each instance. Instead she ignored many circumstances completely. What was in reality only a 233 page effort with 100+ pages of geneology, bibliography and contents could have been with more research and work easily a 450+ page novel.What is written is well written and is an easy read. ""A Family Portrait"" is for the most part exactly that. I bought the book for a greater understanding of the character and that I received. I put the book down believing that although many of the acts attributed to Doc Holliday through legend and Hollywood may be false this version of his life does the complete opposite by not going far enough.I do have what I believe a greater understanding of the man but by far not the complete picture. I'll just have to keep reading."
2,A whitewash,"According to this, Doc Holliday didn't do anything. It sounded like a genteel relative proving that Doc was misunderstood and didn't do all the things for which he is famous. Very disappointing"
1,Terrible! Pap only!,"Tanner has given us absolutely nothing that cannot be obtained in other sources. I see nothing of scholarly endeavor here. If one wishes to read fiction, one should read Eickhoff's THE FOURTH HORSEMAN which is far the better written work and tells just as much as the enigma of Doc Holliday."
2,Very dull,This was just a very dull book and difficult to stick with. It was loaded with pictures and facts about Doc Holliday but was just plain boring.
3,Doc Holliday - A Family Portrait,"I was hoping to get some interesting insight into Doc Holliday by one of his ancestors and this book does provide information on his early life that you don't usually find. However, there was a little too much information about his family - parents, uncles, aunts - that I personally did not care about. There is also a section of Doc Holliday's genealogy that I felt could have been left out, although actually there was a tidbit of information there that was useful to me. I didn't feel that there was much detail brought in to certain events, but then, there are other books that provide practically second by second coverage of the Tombstone gunfight. His death was not written in detail and his famous last words were left out of the book. That said, I would still recommend this book to someone wanting to know more about the life of Doc Holliday away from Tombstone. It is also an easy, to the point read."
4,"A gifted story for history, biography, and genealogy buffs.","American history brought to life with caring concern for the truth, Doc Holliday is seen as a human being not as an icon of the Wild West. Reads like a story but stands up well next to any academic effort; this book is full of source material gathered from John Henry Holliday's relatives by an afficionado of western lore and also a cousin of his. Our public library featured Tanner as author of the month of April and Tanner's writing style is similar to her speaking style--sprinkled with wry wit and based on fearless candor. She tells it like it was."
3,Historical,"I was looking for a little more story telling, this book was mainly about the facts. Especially the first half of the book which was dry and full of family information. If you need a source to write a history paper, this is a 5 star recommendation."
4,A keeper!,If you enjoy learning about the characters of the Old West you'll really enjoy this book! I'd recommend keeping this book for future generations.
2,DVD shelf.,"Item is made from cheap materials. Pressed sawdust shelves, side panels and a cardboard back. The joint between the two halves weak. When assembled and stood up it's wobbly. Unit must be bottom loaded."
1,Watch out: Wrong Color!,"Just received this item, and it's not as pictured: I was sent a solid-black unit that does not look like the photograph on the product page.I can't find any information on the product page that would have warned me I would be receiving a big black shelf unit instead of the wood-toned product I thought I bought.Not sure whether to return it or live with it ... or put it somewhere I don't have to look at.Disappointed buyer."
2,Beware of the vendor,"The scale won't turn off unless I remove the battery, and the vendor is non-responsive."
4,Beautiful Holiday music,This is lovely holiday listening music. Greatbackground music for a holiday party or for sitting quitely reading.
4,Great for Organizing,"If you are someone who is not a natural organizer, or has alot on your plate, then this book would be great for you. There are many helpful tips and ideas. It really helped me out to get rid of things and make the home and daily activities more manageable and functionable. I think that almost anyone would benefit from reading it."
2,Not that special.,"I bought this book after I saw it mentioned in the new Duggar book. I am a pretty organized person to begin with, but after hearing of her method for boxing things up with the separate cards and number system, I figured she may have a few new tricks to teach me. Unfortunately this book didn't carry much else new with it. There are many, many repeated tips in this book and it reads like a 1950's Betty Crocker cookbook in the style of ""adding a touch of this will brighten up your home!"" At the beginning of the book I was dismayed to learn that she believes all women should strive to host Tupperware parties for a living. Lastly, there are many common sense tips such as ""never leave a baby alone in the bathtub"" and ""never leave pets in the car"". Save your money and look for something else."
3,Rather disappointed,"On the positive side, the author does provide some good suggestions and tips. She provides excellent illustrations of pages for creating your own planner for to-do lists and schedules. The book is well-organized and easy to understand. On the downside, it is very outdated. The book begins by addressing ""Women of the Nineties."" The book is also geared towards married women with children. Single women are scarcely even mentioned! Some of the ideas presented I found to be a little unrealistic. If you are already organized, this book might be helpful to fine-tune your organizing. But for some of us that are more organizationally-challenged, the ideas are a little impractical. They sound great in theory but hard to follow through on on a regular basis."
5,Superb!,"I'm the author of ""Thinkertoys"" and ""Cracking Creativity"" and, generally read as many books as I can that relate to thinking. Terry Stickels, in my opinion, is America's Puzzle Master and has produced another great collection of original puzzles. Over the years, I've become a great fan of Terry and the way he makes me think. This book is superb. If you like puzzles, do yourself a favor and buy this book. It's a hoot!"
3,I liked this season,"I watched this season for the beautiful Emily who seemed sincere enough in her search of love and the guys were exceptionally good looking this season :). It did feel that the real feelings were involved, I rooted for Arie, especially when it was revealed that after he was dismissed, he cared enough to fly back trying to see her, it did feel real and what a person who is in love would do.I really think it doesn't matter where you meet a right person: a bus stop, opera, grocery store or the TV show, all that matters that you meet this person."
5,The Bachelorette,Missed this episode and couldn't get it on the TV! It was really neat to down load it and have it to watch when I was ready to watch it!!!!! There aren't all the commericals like on demand!
3,Military purse,"The strap is too short and it's so little that it feels more like a purse, and if you're tall or overweight it'll choke you. A normal notebook does not fit inside. A large moleskine notebook fits perfectly though."
4,Take your daughter to a fantasy land.....or just buy this doll for her!,"I mean, this toy is not too educational-but does everything have to be?! Oh yeah, and little Ms.Explicit, don`t act so rude if someone likes a toy you dont.Just move on with your life! I mean, the kids who worte that review are only 8 or something. Anyways, the doll isn`t that durable, whenever you leave her mermaid too long her wings get crumpled up.I noticed this by observing my little sister play out the whole story with her other mermaidia dolls and this one- she had elina as a mermaid for quite awhile.Also, I think that your daughter might enjoy the doll being a mermaid a bit more than a fairy because the fairy wings are HUGE!And in my opinion, this is a doll you should get your little girl.It can take her away from all those bad role models, like fashion fever and teen trends or whatever.-Critic(and a very good one indeed)"
5,Gorgeous doll,"My daughter recently purchased this doll...what a beauty she is! We are both big fans of Barbie, and this doll is just *gorgeous* My daughter is having many hours of fun playing with this doll."
2,Pretty but...,"My five and half year old daughter asked for this particular barbie doll. She was so happy when she opened her present and found Mermaidia Elina doll. She took it out of the box and started to play with it. Soon enough she lost interest however. The wings are large, so large they are actually a burden. Placing the doll inside the mermaid tail is not easy for little hands either. All in all, this doll is just ""make-up"" if you see what I mean. Pretty but not easy to play with, and easily forgotten. She is on a stand in my daiughter's room, and hasn't been touched or played with since Christmas morning...Not worth the price."
3,okay doll,"Yeah I have this doll and it's alright. It's pretty but not very fun. I would recommend it for a collector.And I have a question for everyone. I'm thirteen years old. Do you think I am too old to play with dolls? Please help because I love playing with my dolls, espescially my American girl and I realized nobody else my age does and it has been bothering me. I really don't want to give up my dolls! Any help would be great!"
4,"Very pretty, fun doll","My four year old daughter received this doll in her Easter basket and she loves it. I think this doll is awesome because Barbie in general is fun, but then little girls also like mermaids and fairies and she is both! My nieces (3 and 5 years) also really liked the doll. I only gave it four stars mainly because the wings don't seem to completely ""rebound"" and pop into their original state after being pressed down into the mermaid tail many times, but it's still a very pretty Barbie and my daughter really likes it."
4,Great buy,I will grab this book before using the HD manual. I especially prefer the way this manual has the wiring schematic laid out. It also contains pointers and useful info that will keep your Hog rolling.
1,Presbyterians and the Revolution is a third grade primmer. W.P. Breed should be ashamed calling this a 'book'!,"All this is is a grand printed brochure that is less than 130 pages that does a disservice to being called a book. A pgamplet or brochure would be much more accurate. As for the price : it is absurd. It is shown on Amazon and touted to be a ""BOOK"". NO thanks and I am surprised that this exscaped the watchful eye of Amazon! Jay Craig"
3,The Only Game In Town,"If you own a bunch of Scepter plastic fuel cans as I do - 6 yellow for diesel fuel and 4 red for gasoline - this is really the only game in town for replacement spouts. Yes, they will come apart at the seams and start to leak after a little while (as pointed out in another review), but they are still better than the Scepter ""Eco"" spouts which don't work at all right from Day 1. At least you can get some fuel out of these flexible yellow spouts before they start to leak.Bottom line is that they are still better than nothing... and in this strange, brave new world of CARB rules, that ain't so bad. I suggest that you buy a few extras. I can guarantee that you are going to need them."
2,Didn't last.,"I can't say I was impressed with this filler spout for very long because it just didn't last. the gasket at the base corroded and broke, so I used e-tape to simulate a gasket and shortly thereafter the ribbing on the flex part started cracking, leaking gasoline everywhere when I poured. No No."
1,Weak product - GOOD SERVICE,"The torque wrench as received was defective. The written instructions warned against storing the wrench on any setting other the the weakest yet when received it was set at approx 75% - who knows how long it was in storage this way. After ruining a hex head bolt I asked for and immediately received a return authorization for a full refund. I did not order a replacement, choosing to go with a Wheeler."
2,"Inaccurate, not sensitive enough, avoid",My knowing how tight tight is alarmed me to the fact that the torque wrench was not indicating any achieved torque when it should have clicked. Thus this is very inaccurate any of the settings I needed and guessed. Almost ruined nice bicycle frame mounting derailluer had I not stopped myself knowing the click was not coming. Avoid this product unless you're working right at it's 80% rating.
1,Don't bother unless you pay up for it.,"I decided to give this is try & had a terrbile experience with this. I have used others of the same length at 60 in-lbs and know what the pressure feels like. When testing this wrench I couldn't seem to get it to click at any torque adjustment, so I used two fingers and put roughly 60 in-lbs of force on it - snapped the 1/4"" drive. So not only would it not read torque, but it also snapped due to possible casting defects.Beam style wrenches are more accurate & less complex to damage. Don't bother with this click-style wrench in in-lb (ft-lb would be fine in click-style) unless you are going to pay up for a high quality one."
5,Excellent product,Excellent product at a great price.I found a similar one at Northern Tools but it was not the right torque range. I am working on small engines and I needed a wrench calibrated for around 50 Inch/Pounds not Foot/Pounds. Price is great. Quality is excelent. Delivery was faster than expected. No complaints.
5,Would never think an inexpensive brush could be this good,"I bought this brush after reading the reviews and figured if I didn't like it, I wouldn't be out much money.I love it! My hair is shoulder-length and wavy and this is the perfect brush for it.As someone else mentioned, this isn't a styling brush (I have round brushes for that), but for brushing your hair out at night or first thing in the morning, it's wonderful. The nylon bristles go to the scalp and seem to help the natural bristles go through the hair easier. It leaves my hair soft and shiny."
1,Absolute Garbabe,I threw this brush away pretty quickly after receiving it. I thought it would be a cheaper version of the #25 Spornette Porcupine brush but just as good. I was wrong. The synthetic bristles were awful. Garbage Garbage Garbage
3,"easy to use, but hard to clean","The brush makes hair easy to tight up, right in shape, but very hard to clean!"
1,About as effective as using my hand to brush my hair,I did not like this brush at all. I have thick hair and it hardly felt like I was brushing it - it's too soft with little fluffy bristles which impede the brushing action of the longer stronger ones. Since it's not worth the cost of returning it I'll give it to my grand daughter and will let you know if its a hit with her as she does get a lot of tangles in her very fine hair.
2,Did I get the right brush?,"When I received this brush, I honestly when back to the listing several times to see if I got the right brush. All the reviews (save a few) are glowing. I have long, relatively thin hair. Although the brush seems to go through tangles nicely (which is why I gave it a generous 2 stars instead of 1,) the thing really hurts my scalp. Massaging effect? Absolutely not. I kept on checking the bristles to see if maybe some of the balls on the head were missing, but they weren't. As long as I keep the brush from actually touching my scalp, it's fine, but it's hard to do because my hair isn't very thick. Plus, as other reviewers said, it looks like it is going to be a nightmare to clean. I honestly don't get all the reviews. Maybe I got a lemon. Maybe my scalp is more sensitive than a 7-year olds. I'm just glad I paid less than $5, because it's going in the trash as soon as I can find a better brush to replace it."
4,Great Brush for Kiddie Hair,ONLY brush that I can use on my 5yo and 8yo that does not make them scream in pain. This brush does a great job of navigating through knots and no ouch factor. I now have one in every room of the house. Downside Not easy to clean.
4,Glad to have found this online!,"I have been using a similar Revlon brush for years, but they no longer carry it at the store I was purchasing it from. I really love the longer bristles for de-tangling and shorter ones for smoothing. I slightly prefer the old style I was using because it was wider, but this is a decent replacement. The little balls at the end do have a tendency to wear away making the longer bristles very sharp, but I just clip them off with nail clippers. Because of this, the brush will eventually have to be replaced, but this brush is great if you can't shell out the money for the better quality yet super expensive ones of a similar style."
5,Economical brush set,"For the price, you get two and they are well constructed. The beaded bristles protect scalp from abrasion. Good deal."
3,Football fan,"My son loves this game! The only problem is that it periodically shuts down and goes black while he is playing it. We knew it was a used game when buying it, so due to the age of the game we are not surprised. We love Amazon and will continue to purchase from it."
2,Stay away,"This game is not worth anything at all! I bought this game thinking it was gonna look somewhat like PSP's version but it stinks! The graphics are so bad the players look like a bunch of sticks with hard to see numbers on them. There are only about 8 plays to choose from. And the soundtrack.... There is only one song playing, and that song is ""revelations"" by audioslave. It plays on forever! If you like this game, than u need professional help. I wasted 3 months allowance on this, and I can't get it returned because it was opened. I gave it two stars because I feel sorry for the people who made the game. Get it for PSP, PS2, PS3, XBox or Xbox 360, not for DS."
2,"Well, what should have I expected????","I just purchased a DS and am a die-hard Madden fan. I thought that being in 2006 we would see a fantastic offering for the DS sports category.....dead wrong. This game would get 5 stars for the GBA, but considering the upgraded hardware, it falls way short. I guess that I was yearning for a console version that I could play on a portable, but ultimately got dragged back into the late 90's with this game. The graphics are okay, but the gameplay is seriously lacking. I firmly believe that this is not EA's fault...it's the DS. Plays run so fast that you never really have a chance to let them develop and the touch screen kicking motion is a joke.The expanded menu options and the season mode are enticing, but without sustainable gameplay I've lost the motivation to continue playing."
3,"Great singer, great vocal, horrible editing and bad director","I love adele, her voice, songs and etcnothing against her.but the concert editing is horriblebasically the director use everything tricks in the book for the showpanning in and out on the artist,panning in and out on the concert hallpanning in and out on the audienceslow motionless than 1 sec cut from artist to concert hall to audience to band to the backup singer back to artistjust HORRIBLEi will just listen to the CD"
3,Not for young kids.,"This is a very good dvd, as far as concert dvds go. But Adele uses foul language and gestures throughout. I bought it to watch with our 5 and 10 year old daughters who just adore Adele's music. But my wife and I will not let them watch this."
3,good audio..bad video,"True, her voice is good..but cutting to all the roll-focus shots one after another after another made me want to scream at the director! I am probably more sensitive to this because this is my business. We all learned early on to make your edits ""invisible"" to the consumer.These are really NOT.But, the performance is good."
5,Wish I had been there,This is one of the most incredible live performance videos I have ever seen. It is very evident that there is a very good chemistry between the audience and Adele. Maybe she uses some bad language between the songs but the audience loves it and when she starts singing you forget all about that. The sound and image quality is excellent and the cutting of the video gives a good feeling of what it must have been like to be there. I'm sure that we will get to hear a lot more from Adele and I really hope to get a chance so watch her live.
5,"You owned it, Adele.","This was the best purchase I have made since 1994.Adele, you owned your audience. I am from South Africa and I ordered this dvd set from the USA via Germany to South Africa, and it cost 3 times more than the initial purchase price - but it was worth every effort and every penny.You had us in tears, and moments thereafter, we were all laughing.You set a new international standard not only with your music, but with your mind-blowing stage personality. It felt like knowing you personally.I will get a plane ticket and head down to the uk or even the US later this year, to see you live.Gosh - this is the best purchase I have ever made.Brilliant. Fantastic. Wonderful."
5,Christmas present,"I gave this to my daughter, she is a huge fan of Adele, I knew she will enjoy it and she does. I was in the kitchen with my wife and we hear her voice, Adele's voice and it is angelical. 100% recommended."
3,Horrible directing,"This is a great concert by Adele. No one can sing like she can and she sings all her top songs. The problem is the director does not let us enjoy it. He continually jumps from camera to camera, every few seconds. I buy a DVD because it gives you a front row seat, but not here. You will find yourself watching the concert from all over the arena, including lots of views of her backside, from the side and every instrumentalist au nausea. Its as if the director thinks we will forget where the concert is if he doesn't continually show the concert hall from every imaginable direction. A lot of out of focus shots. I would suggest you buy the cd or listen to the DVD with the television picture off. We buy the concert to see what the audience sees. The audience got to see more of Adele than we did. What a shame."
3,"Concert = Great, Video = Blah","The concert was excellent. The video was very inconsistent. Stage shots were excellent to good, and audience shots were grainy and blurry at best."
4,Must buy if you're a fan!,"When I saw that this was releasing, I preordered it immediately. As expected, this is amazing, even better that it comes with a cd of the concert as well. My only issue is the video quality could have been better. The crowd shots are quite grainy, not a big deal. The audio is great. I'm happy they decided to release a live dvd of her show considering she had to cancel many of her shows this year. Adele is the truth. This is a must own for any fan."
5,Adele at the Royal Albert Hall,"This is an awesome CD/DVD combo,anyone that likes Adele will love this. You can't go wrong with this purchase.Great gift idea!"
5,Album of the year,I have watched this concert over and over. It is the next best thing to being there. I only wish there was more behind the scenes footaage.
