4,Deeper Meaning,"Put aside the title, the gore, and feel for the depth and truth.If you look past your own blindness, you'll see it written there. I did. And came away refreshed, renewed, and perhaps a little more in tune because of the recurring lesson... It's not hidden, but there in black and white, written over and over again. You just need to open your own eyes to see it, feel it, and know it... That awareness that you've just stumbled on something you have known all your life, yet had somehow forgotten or let lay too long. It's worth it.. to know it again.** A great book for the reader who comprehends the space between the lines **"
3,Great Story...Poor Research,"First let me point out what I disliked about the book. I am from Alberta where the story takes place and the author has done a good deal of research on our province but there are a couple of glaring errors that ripped me out of the story. The first one being when Sam was a child and his father put the heated ""loonie"" 1-dollar coin in to his hands. The loonie has only been around since 1987, and judging by the books timeline this event took place in the late 70Â¡s or very early 80's. Another error that jumped out at me was when the author referred to Canadian ""provinces"" as ""states"". I'm sure not to many Canadians were pleased with this one. Otherwise I found this to be a very entertaining read."
4,Good Read with Some Beginner's Flaws,"I read ""Furnace"" first and back-tracked to ""The Trickster.""I have no major complaints at all. This is a very diverting and well-written supernatural thriller. In comparison to ""Furnace,"" I noted two things -- the characterization is weaker. Gray obviously means for us to like the characters in Trickster, but she doesn't pull it off quite as well. Also, while ""Furnace"" was notable for a near-zero rate of Scots/American English translation errors, ""The Trickster"" is full of them. For some reason, the Indians speak like budding rap stars. And a very proper young mother greets her son with the salutation ""How's it hanging?"""
4,A really good book. Not H.P. Lovecraft but getting there.,"The only similarity to King is that it's printed on paper; everything else is superior to anything he has produced. Better ideas, better characters, better writing, just plain better."
1,Really bad.,"The fact that this book is a fast read is about the best thing I can say about it. But just because it's fast, don't think for a minute you're going to get anywhere by the end! Especially not with the mediocre characterization and a muddled plot full holes as big as the train tunnel that's one of the book's settings. Plus, it's needlessly brutal, even for the horror genre (there's a reacurring motif of bodies and heads cleaved in half. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not) If you're looking for a good Native American horror novel, pick up ""Crota"" by Owl Goingback instead."
5,better then hoped for...,"if I did not know better I would think this book was new, with small wear due to being in a major bookstore. I am more then happy, thank you."
5,african redbush tea,GREAT TEA. Good substitute for coffee. A staple in the pantry. Broad range of people like it...even non-tea hard-core coffee drinkers.
4,Great flavor for an herbal tea,"OK - so I've hit the point where I can't tolerate my much loved coffee anymore,or anything that has a slight bit of caffeine, so I'm constantly searching for a good replacement. A really, really good herbal tea is hard to find - one that has a full-bodied flavor and can somewhat replace that good cup of coffee. This tea, while not quite there, is one of the closest I've come to, and I've certainly run the gammut in tea testing over the years. It actually has a very pleasant flavor, and is very enjoyable to drink, which is more than can be said for most herbal teas. One tea bag also makes 2-3 large cups, an unusual fact for an herbal tea. And - it's supposed to be amazingly good for you according to it's own packaging...."
3,Not peachy,"This tea has a somewhat strong spicy taste. I, nor others I have asked, have been unable to detect a peach flavor in this tea as one might assume from its name. Perhaps the spicy flavor is too overwhelming."
5,Earthy Flavor and Soothing Effects,"Yogi Tea's masterpiece, African Redbush Tea, was recommended to me by a friend. I went to Yogi's website to request a free sample of this delicious tea, and then I waited six weeks for it to arrive. The bold, earthy taste of this tea calms me every time I drink it. It does not contain added caffeine, and the flavors are all natural, including Ginger Root, Cardamom Seed, and peach. This tea is light and I enjoy it every evening, as it is strong-flavored but not too heavy. I highly recommend this tea to everyone, as I have to family and friends already."
5,A good starter...,"...for someone interested in exploring some of our musical heritage. The Roots of bluegrass, country, even the Grateful Dead are here."
2,A fun read.,"Really wasn't what I was looking for, but it was a fun resourse. The book is more of a ""look it up"" to see how you want to become something."
3,Only for the Motivated,"I was intrigued by what this book was all about ... but it's really for the motivated person or someone w/a lot of time on their hands. Though it's just a ""guide"" and you can really make what you want of it, it's a lot of work! Seems more work than it would be ""fun"" to accomplish each task. Alot more so than how I recall my GirlScout days. It's not something you can accomplish in just a couple days or even months. That is, unless you've really got a lot of time on your hands to devot to each task.I won't throw the book out ... perhaps I'll pick it up in a later period of my life and decide to tackle it."
3,It's just okay,"This book is really nothing to shout out about. The stickers are nice, but I found the book quite boring and repetitive."
3,"Chicken Soup for the ultra-motivated soul, basically.","Don't get me wrong, I really like this book. It's got good tips in it, but it's definitely overly 'cheesy' to me. Some points in some topics are *somewhat*-to-completely obvious, so it gets a little tiring to skim through things I already know through common sense (and perhaps through being a little older than 12).Also what I was somewhat annoyed by was the 'motivational' tips on each page where I can basically write that I'm going to get more organized or make sure I throw out old banking statements.What I do like is the uncommon suggestions from real experts on such things. That's the sort of thing I bought the book for. So my suggestion to make the book better would be to condense things a bit, and don't suggest everything, only provide more helpful tips that most seemingly don't think about instead of a gen-ed guide to living."
2,"Disappointing - lots of ideas, but doesn't follow through!","I love to do things. I love doing new things! From arts & crafts (etching glass, and blacksmithing), to unusual sports (like sailing or bungee jumping), I am passionate about learning new things.However, this book - while chalk full of ideas - is very skimpy on actual direction. While other resources are listed (usually another book that you should buy, or a website you need to visit) - I was hoping for a book that not only had great ideas --- but had information on how to actually DO the activity (and what skills I might need to have before-hand before starting).This book has a wonderful concept, but it would have been even better if it had more details and information on how to actually DO things.NOTE: the forward written by the author's sister is heartbreaking...and bumped this book from a 1-star to 2-stars, just based on that letter."
5,I LOVE this book!,"I have bought this book for all of my girl/women friends from college graduate-age to 60 years old! It is really inspirational, and I love hte little challenges it gives you. I consider myself a goal-setter, and this is the perfect map to setting and reaching goals. It's great for getting you thinking about all the things in your life you could never imagine yourself doing -- and then giving you a way to do them! I highly recommend it for any woman."
2,Easily broken,We purchased these glasses because we liked the simple design and the price. Either we got a bad batch or they are just very fragile but we only have 3 glasses left out of the 12. They break very easily. One even broke while we were cleaning the inside with a sponge. Not worth the money because you soon won't have any left and you'll just have to buy more.
4,Nice,"Nice glasses, not too bad in quality. Haven't had a chance to really use them yet but they seem like they will last. My only complaint was that there were sticker labels on the bottom of each glass that was impossible to peel off nicely. Had to use goof-off on them to get off all the residue. Stuff came off after that. Other than that I am satisfied."
2,Factory seconds?,"Two of the glasses I received have major flaws. One lots of bubbles in the side of the glass, and another has highly visible rings around the glass where the thickness abruptly changes. Many of the others have minor flaws, including small bumps on the inside of the rim. They all hold water, but four of them look bad enough that I certainly wouldn't hand them to a guest.If these aren't factory seconds, then I'm really depressed about the quality of American manufacturing.And, each glass has a UPC sticker on the bottom which I had to scrape off with a knife, leaving residue that I removed with acetone."
2,Nice enough for guests,"Over the years I have discovered that drinking glasses are actually disposable items. I like a thin drinking glass and have learned to live with the fact that there will be breakage! In fact, one glass arrived in pieces. But that left 11 pretty good looking glasses so I decided not to return them.These glasses will work just fine. They are thin and tall and have a heavy bottom which seems to help stability. If anything, they might be just a bit narrow for my taste but all in all they are more than adequate for my needs. I feel they will serve me well and in a few years when most of them have broken, I will just buy another set.Update: January 16, 2013These glasses lasted about 2 years and it is time to buy new ones. I have decided to go with a thicker glass this time because I feel they will last a lot longer."
4,"Great glasses, lousy packing","My first set arrived broken, which was no surprise considering there was no padding on the bottom of the box. Who is teaching packing 101 at the warehouse? Amazon replaced them promptly, but why don't they just get it right the first time?"
1,Cheap glasses,"These glasses are cheaply made and as a result some of them were broken in shipping. I don't blame Amazon for not shipping them properly, they are just so poorly made that they break easily. When I saw them I was incredibly disappointed and returned them."
3,"Smaller than described, huge messy sticker on each one","The glasses are fine, although they're smaller than described: mine hold barely 12 oz, not 15.But why, oh why do manufacturers slap on huge, cheap paper stickers that are impossible to remove? Every single glass now has a sticky mess on the bottom."
2,3 arrived cracked,"This jibes with what others have said about these glasses being so fragile. They're in the washer now so I'll see how they fare. On the other hand, they really are cheap."
4,Good Sturdy Glasses,These are a little too skinny for my taste but they work well and are very sturdy. Hard to clean without a special tool but still good glasses.
3,okay,"their ok .. better than the rocks glass, but still imperfections on the rim.. At least no sharp areas. Really there ok for me .."
3,Okay,These glasses are ok. Not quite strong and durable as I had hoped for. They crack very easy even setting them in dishwater they will crack. Suggest make a little more durable.
3,No frills,"More a high ball drink glass than a water glass, but suitable for casual home use. Heavy base and think glass hold up well in dishwashers."
1,Poor Quality,"I sent these back because they were so poor quality. They looked as if approximately 1/3 of them were seconds. Many of the rims had noticeable imperfections, I guess where they poured the glass. One of the glasses was also cracked. Fortunately Amazon was good as always and took them back."
1,breaks easily,"I purchased this set and have been using it for less than a month. Out of 12 tumblers 6 have broken. These were not dropped..they break during normal washing (hand washing - no dishwasher). Unless you are particularly fond of picking up broken glass or really really enjoy getting deep cuts on your hand(s) stitched, I wouldn't buy these!"
1,Easily Broken,"We purchased 24 of these glasses about 6 months ago and are now down to 5. They broke under normal use....in the dishwasher, in the kitchen sink (stainless steel) and a couple even broke while dispensing ice from the ice maker. These are the least durable glasses we have ever purchased. Oddly, we also have the 9 oz rocks size and haven't broken any."
1,Thin glass,"OK, it is a great price, but within 1 week of using them, we had 3 broken glasses. 1 year later we have 3 left! They are made super thin and they break at the slightest thing! Save your money"
2,Big Lots,"I got these, pulled them out of the box, and put them in the dishwasher. I figured they looked fine at first glance, so why beak out the inspection mirror. As I removed the first one from the dishwasher, I noticed on the lip was an area much thicker than the rest of the rim, as I pulled out the rest 9 out of 12 had this same flaw. Now I realize they were not expensive, but this was not some flaw missed by an inspector, these were rejects and I don't remember seeing that in the description. By the way, I also bought some smaller ones in the same order from Amazon and they had the same flaw. Very disappointed my Amazon friends, it makes me wonder about ordering more expensive items."
2,not the highest quality,"nice glasses, and I was impressed that they were made in the USA, however two of the twelve glasses had bad rims and were not usable. I would have expected defective glasses like these to be removed in production. Well packaged, with individual bubble wrap. Too bad the quality is not higher."
2,They Break Easily,"I love the look and feel of these glasses, but they break WAY too easily in the dishwasher, even getting ice from the dispenser on the refridgerator door. I'm on my third set and am facing the fact that these glasses are so fragile that they are a danger to fingers unloading the dishwasher. I am looking, reluctantly, for a heavier duty replacement."
4,An good reference for a inadequately covered subject area.,"An excellent book that is unfortunately more of a coffee table book than a reference guide. Photography is interesting and satisfying with good but sometimes disconnected text. Does not fill the desperately needed void for a field guide for this fastly growing collectible. Also fails to identify most of the miniatures within it's pages. The creative presentation of the subject matter, however, more than makes up for the areas in which it is lacking."
1,A cheezy collection of covers,"Schon's last two solo projects (Beyond the Thunder and Electric World) were recordings worthy of his reputation as the guitarist for Santana and Journey. Those albums had some spark of originality in both the compostions and the playing. Voices, unfortunately, is a by-the-book collection of covers of pop-radio cheeze-whiz. Only someone with an eye on the bottom line would cover - on the same album - Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On and Bryan Adams' Everything I Do, I Do For You. Skip this and go buy Beyond the Thunder."
2,"NEAL, PLEASE COME BACK TO THE BLUES","Neal, like my previous fellow reviewer, you are a FANTASTIC AXE SLINGER. But, this? Mariah Carey even? No offense, but, dude... what ever happened to TOPAZ?!?!?! I WANT MORE TOPAZ, no MARIAH CAREY! I love anything you play, but, CHANGE YOUR CONTENT, NOW! Otherwise, I am gonna tie you to the mast, and make you play it. hahaHow about more blues?! Do some Bloomfield tunes, not Annie Lennox. These are great performances..yada yada yada, but, they are not great for your fans, I CAN SPEAK FOR MANY. Go over to Sammy's house and drink some tequila, then, YOU TWO SHOULD GET BACK TO SOME BLUES AND ROCK ASAP! Good god, am I the only one here who feels this way? hahahaha Keep rockin."
4,Sucker for guitar work,I admit freely that I love works like this. It could be the most basic techniques used but albums like this always amaze me and in my limited ability show off the true creative nature of a guitarist.
2,How Could You take to Easy Street?,"Having been a fan of Neal Schon for decades I can only guess that he put this collection together to satisfy some sort of record label production requirement. Come on. He used to make his guitar sing and wail. Now it's me who's crying. I wouldn't put this cd with my jazz collection, and I wouldn't listen to it in an elevator. I can't think of anywhere.. well, there was that castaway story.Neal is great. Neal can be very original. So what's this thing?I gave it a two, only because Neal gets a 10 from me for being Neal. I averaged the scores. You figure the cd rating.Neal, this isn't Highway 1. I think you should have called this ""Easy Street""Still a fan - but wondering."
3,Very interesting read,"I enjoyed this book, if only for the humor and perserverance shown by Mr. Grodin.I think it should be on the syllabus of every entry level acting class.My brother is contemplating going to film school, and I've already sent him his own copy."
5,Forgotten Gem by Malle,"I saw this movie in the theatre many years ago and thought it wonderful then. These many years later, I wondered if it was out there on DVD. No such luck, but I did find a VHS and have just spent one of the more enjoyable afternoons in a long time, wallowing around in the pleasure that watching a Louis Malle film brings.This is a beautifully and heartbreakingly told tale based on true-life events ... of new immigrants who were ""going to own my own boat"", to young men who can't figure out how to live in a new world they never thought would find them with nothing to offer.I believe Ed Harris and Amy Madigan met on the set here, and their heat is evident in the motel scenes. They later married.Malle takes the time to acquaint you with his characters; his dialog rings true; and it is a tale told well. One of those little films that have been forgotten. And that's too bad. Perhaps it will be rediscovered in times to come."
4,Good movie. No DVD?,"This movie isn't great. But I have a friend whose family came from Vietnam and his father works in the shrimping business in Louisiana. This movie takes place in Texas in the 80s, but it still resonates."
1,Antiquated view of homosexuality,"Don't waste your time. You can't change your sexual orientation. The author's views are antiquated, misleading and inaccurate. Find a book about learning to accept who you are. END"
3,Great fun but fragile,"This rebounder is great fun but the lower joints collapsed after only 2 weeks of use. Potential solutions: (i) only use this rebounder from 10 feet away instead of 20, (ii) brace the lower-front joints with the pins provided, (iii) re-design the lower-front joints to be a single 3-fingered piece, instead of 3 pieces connected by just one screw."
1,Net is defective,We assembled this item on a Wednesday and by Sunday the net had already broken in several places. My kid had not even used the net before it frayed.
2,Net tore on the first day of use,"We just bought this item for our 10 year old son, who loves to play soccer. It was pretty easy to set up with clear directions, and everything was as described in the listing. However, after my 10 year old, my 8 year and I were playing with it for a few hours having a great time, one of my sons pointed out that that the net was already torn. Upon further inspection, I realized he was right and that the net appeared to be very low quality.I later contacted Franklin about a warranty claim, but they weren't taking calls. I emailed my claim a few days ago per their instructions, but I have yet to hear anything back. I called today, but didn't reach a live person - I left a message. Someone called me back and apologized that I didn't get a confirmation, but I should be receiving the replacement net in a week or so. So that part of customer service was very good.Hopefully the new net holds out better."
3,Wish it came with all it's parts,"This was not packaged in it's original box (looks like a returned item to me). The parts sort of rattled about in the package causing some damage to the metal bars. Also, the ends of the box were almost open when it arrived. The product was missing it's instructions, bolts and nuts as well as the stakes to secure it to the ground.Since my kids burst into tears when I mentioned returning the item, I got new stainless steel bolts and nuts and galvanized ground stakes at Home Depot, and figured out how to put it together without the instructions. I also got a can of rustoleum to touch up any dinks and scratched in the finish.The product itself is really nice. Works well, and the kids are really enjoying the rebound."
3,Best suited for kids 12 yrs or younger,"Rebounder net was easy to assemble according to the directions provided. Frame appear to be of good qualtiy, however the netting seems a bit thin for heavy duty use. On the first day of use by my 15 year old son, he drove a shot into the center of the netting and it ripped, indicating to me that the device was not designed of old, stronger teens and is better suited for younger, smaller players. The net does round very well and works as intended, but I would recommend only for 12 yrs or younger."
5,Great rebounder by Franklin from Amazon.com,"Easy assembly, good quality, nice rebounder. This is not a goal, it is a rebounded so don't buy it for full power kicks. It is plenty strong enough for rebounding to me and my 13 year old."
2,Net is too small and does not look like the one in the picture,"After reviewing several products, I ordered this one from Amazon. It took me half an hour to assemble and I realized the net is too small for the frame. The soccer ball can go through gaps between the net and frame. A big disappointment. I will contact the manufacturer to send me the replacement net before I return the product."
2,Too many errors!!!,"I am not an advanced Excel user, but it is easy to find out that this book has many mistakes in coordinating the problem descriptions with the solutions, as well as typos in the book, when referring to certain cells. So, I do not know which of them should be corrected, but it is hard and time consuming, at least for a novice user, to understand what is going on. The solutions to advanced problems have no explanation, which on one hand is good because it makes you try to think...on the other hand though, it is such a disappointment to find out that the solutions you try to understand are wrong!! You can easily find it out by doublechecking with pen and paper..."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as expected","I am an intermediate to advanced Excel user, so my review may reflect that level. As others have said, it looks like MS rushed this book to the market, evidenced by so many errata, which can be disappointing especially when the solution is wrong. On the other hand, there are some very interesting and genuine uses of various Excel functions to solve business problems.I wouldn't recommend this book for beginners. If you're trying to learn Excel, this is not the book. It is not a book to teach excel, but a book to teach you what you can do with Excel to solve everyday problems, given you're familiar with the mechanics of excel.I would recommend it with these caveats. And getting Walkenbach's book on Excel functions along with this would be very helpful in my opinion. Best of luck in your endeavors."
4,Good Book,"Overall this book was good. The first half of the book is pretty easy. It explains basic functions in excel and the author does a good job in explaining on how to do those functions. The second half of the book is kinda complicated because it contains a lot of statiscal functions like multiple regression, Two-Way ANOVA, bionomial and hypergeometric random variables and Weibull and beta distributions. Overall the book is great for anyone who is a business major or someone who owns a business."
4,"Very practical, but full of errors","Overall, I like this book, even though it is somewhat confusing, both in scope and in the target audience.The techniques of ""naming the range"" or writing the ""if"" formula are certainly targeted for beginners, but most of statistical tools are normally used by more advanced users.The worst thing, though, is that the book is full of errors, both typos and mistakes in problem solutions on the disk. I consider myself an intermediate user, so finding an error in ""instructor solution"" was more like an additional challenge for me, but for the beginner this could be very frustrating.On the positive side - I really liked the idea of problems in the end of each chapter; so many books just give you the theory and then you do not know how to solve a real life problem. For most of chapters, I knew the tools, but still had to spend time figuring out the best way to implement it for problem solving.Very practical book, good for intermediate users. Just be aware of the typos !"
5,Very Good Book,"I am an intermediate Excel user. I was looking for a book that could be used as a quick reference. This book is the best book I have ever read. I learned a great deal about hidden capabilities of Microsoft Excel. If you work with excel a lot, especially for analyzing data, this is the book for you. Every chapter introduces a new excel technique. Explanations are straight forward and easy to understand. Included CD has all the examples, both solved and unsolved.I analyze a lot of data in my job everyday. Techniques I learned from this book help me everyday in getting my work done faster."
4,"Delivered quickly, included CD-ROM, good condition as stated by seller","The product was delivered in a timely manner, was in good condition as promised, and included all materials. I am very satisfied with this transaction"
4,good for mba students learning excel,I think the book provides many good tips on learning how to use the many tools excel provides a business analyst.
4,Great Resource,"It could possibly be a 5 star. It's great for those who need it to supplement knowledge obtained ""on the job"". I recommend it."
4,school of life,"i recently ordered a dvd of the movie ""school of life"" through amazon, and ultimately, through one of their suppliers: dvdcd central. unfortunately, the dvd was defective, and after i contacted the supplier, my money was promptly refunded without any problem. i would not hesitate to use them again in the future."
4,My New Favorite movie...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Even though it may predictable, as some reviewers have said, I love movies that cause me to think about my mortality and remind me to not take it or people around me for granted. That's what ""School of Life"" does for me. If you want a movie that has corny humor and depth then you'll enjoy this movie also."
5,Very Surprising,"I was very surprised I liked this movie. The only reason I wanted to watch it is because of Ryan Reynolds. I wish he was in more movies, I love to watch him act, he has IT. I've seen just about every movie he's been in. Even more, why couldn't I had a teacher like Mr. D (Reynolds) when I went to school. The movie made me cry, which is a good bonus, everyone needs a heartfelt cry once in awhile. Didn't think it would be any good since it was a family film, but it gives a great message. Definitely check this movie whether your a fan of Ryan Reynolds or not."
2,it has a message on the bottom of the screen,every 10 min a message comes up and its embarsseing cus i showed it to freinds and they thought it was a first copy or somethingi was very sad
4,Calling all history fans,"Yes, I am absolutely crazy about 16th century French history. And Dumas has a whole series for this era. Though ""La Dame de Montsoreau"" is my favorite of the series, the Forty-Five does not lack young, handsome and rich gentlemen and beautiful and graceful ladies, not to mention the private lifestyle (humorous I found) of the King Henri III and his brother the duc d'Alenon. It was overall just captivating, I felt like I was reliving this time period. Again, I suggest you read the whole series, especially since this is the last book in the series. But I prefer this 'Valois' series to the 'D'Artagnan' or 'Marie-Antoinette' etc. series... It's more fascinating for me. The only thing is, that the end leaves a little something to be desired. I don't know if Dumas meant to write a fourth book in the series, cuz he seems to leave a few things hanging. But if you can ignore that, the rest of the plot is great!"
3,Review of old dutch hammered paper towel holder.,"It is everything I wanted except for one extremely annoying little detail, you have to unscrew the globe-like atlas on the top for quite a bit and remove it prior to replacing the paper towels. For this reason I was looking to buy a different copper paper towel holder as this is very inconvenient in the kitchen. Beauty just doesn't get it done."
4,Beautiful but not very practical,"This paper towel holder looks gorgeous and is a very nice addition to my copper collection. The only drawback - as mentioned in other reviews - is that the top has to be unscrewed every time a new paper towel roll is needed.It looks great, but I wouldn't say it is the most practical."
3,"Attractive, but not as functional as I would like","This item is attractive, but not as functional as I would like. I change rolls often and the finial has lost its threading. It did last a few years though."
4,copper paper towel holder,"nice item, a little crooked in the beginning when put together so have to play with it a bit. but good looking."
5,Old Dutch hammered copper paper towel holder,This paper towel holder is very pretty. It is quite sturdy and easy to use. You do have to put it together yourself. I added a felt pad to the bottom. I'm very pleased with this product.
3,Krona pot review,"The Krona pot was received in a box that was ripped and torn and badly damaged. The exterior shipping box showed no sign of damage whatsoever therefore it was concluded that the store shipped an item that had been used for display because the pot while not damaged was dusty and did not look bright and shiny. Because it was a Christmas gift and there was no time for an exchange, I wiped and shined the pot myself. The handle in the cover was attached in the proper position for use and not attached on the underside of the cover which one would expect for shipping. This may have been because some consumers do not realize that the handle is shipped attached to the underside to prevent damage or it may have been because the pot was on display."
5,Italiano by Gene Pitney,I purchased this cd to replace the vinyl lp plus to get the spanish songs which I had not been able to find.I love it!
4,Nice little light,"Nearly 5 stars. Plenty bright, very small (my fist almost covers it), and batteries last a long time. I have not experienced any of the problems with flickering that other users mentioned. This lives on my belt daily and is just fine for non-tactical use here in Afghanistan, lighting my way around camp at night or for essential use when the generator goes out. My only complaint is that the case is shabby: it is not a very loose fit for the light and when you velcro it shut, there is still a big space at the top where, given a hard bump the wrong way, the light can pop out. The light itself is a nice piece of equipment, especially for the price, but it seems they paid someone about 5 cents for a cheapo holster. Still good enough for my everyday carry and I don't regret the purchase at all."
1,4 out of 4 Did Not Work,"I purchased 4 of these flashlights to give to my kids for a trip. Foolishly assuming that they are simple flashlights, what could go wrong, I did not save the packing material (there were no instructions, why would you need them for a flashlight). I tried all 4 with fresh Duracell batteries, even checked the batteries and they were fully charged. Not a single one of the 4 flashlights that I ordered and received worked. I changed the position of the batteries, did everything that could be done with a flashlight to make it work - nothing. Clearly they are not the highest craftsmanship, but to get 4 out of 4 is impressively bad. Please do not waste your money."
2,2 out of 3 DOA (dead on arrival),"2 out of 3 failed to turn ""on"" on 3 different sets of batteries (which worked in 3rd one).Very disappointing!One that works is bright and all appears to be well mechanically made, with 2 o-ring seals.Too bad, electrical/functional yield is 33%..."
1,2 for 2 bad,"Don't purchase this item ! I purchased this flashlight as a gift for an elderly relative and after installing the batteries it flickered and died. Since I kept it for > 30 days before I was out of luck returning it. My bad. So, I ordered a new unit and apologized to my mother-in-law for the defective gift. We installed the batteries and presto: nothing. This unit was completed dead. I least I can send this one back. Also, I noted that both the rear and front screw caps emitted metal shavings when removing/re-iinstalling. Overall this is not a quality product to say the least."
1,Super dead flashlight,I bought this as a Christmas present & got a call a few days after Christmas asking if I had the receipt because it didn't work! Tried new batteries & nothing. I didn't keep the packing materials/receipt so I couldn't even return it. Embarrassed & dissapointed.
3,"Very Bright, but...","This flashlight is very bright indeed. I wish I had been able to read the warranty and see the notice about the lead content because I would not have purchased these items, especially for use by our grandkids. Instead, we will place them in our cars and keep them for emergencies."
2,By No means Not the best LED flashlight!,Of the 21 LEDs 20 work. If you tap it right I get a bright light. Otherwise it's a dim low light. It flickers on and almost off. That's when a lite tap works. This is a pice of crap flashlight. I can't believe Amazon sales something as low in quality as this flashlight. I'd send it back but I gave it to a friend. I went to Lowe's and got a LED flashlight that works.
2,Unreliable,"I bought this flashlight for walking my dog in the evening and while I loved it the first few times now it constantly flickers, dims, and is more irritating than it is helpful. On the upside the size is perfect for long walks but does not serve it's purpose which is to help me see where I am going. Sadly I bought a 3-LED pup-light for my dog and that doesn't flicker and is 20 times brighter!"
3,Very bright light but...,Great light but you have to hold in the pushbutton to turn on light. There is no way to keep it on without holding button in.
2,Bright,"The shipping was quick, the light is very bright and batteries were included. However, if you lightly shake the flashlight the light goes on and off. Overall, for the price, not bad. I just wanted to try an LED flashlight."
1,Didn't work,The batteries they provided did not turn the flashlight on so I tried my own new ones and the flashlight still would not even flicker.
2,"Good value, poor performance","This flashlight is great when it works. The flickering, as mentioned in other reviews, is unchanged by shaking or twisting the model. The light output is bright, but not as bright as a single-LED flashlight I already own. I would have expected brighter light from this 21-LED flashlight.Other than that, the flashlight is sturdy, lightweight, and it fits nicely in the palm of my hand."
4,Nice flashlight,"Got it on time! i am in love with it. It has been a while sine i got it and i use it on daily basis, it is of a good quality and i am very happy with it."
3,Average Flashlight,"The best way I can describe this flashlight is to compare it to one of those $3 EverReady flashlights in Pros and Cons:Pros: Half the size of an EverReady, made of metal so it ""feels"" sturdier, slightly brighter.Cons: Unreliable in it's lighting - sometimes it's brighter, sometimes it's dimmer, sometimes you've got to bang it on your hand to try and keep it from flickering or dimming.Not a horrible flashlight - I'm doing fine with it - I like the compact nature of it, but the reliability of the steadiness of the lighting is more akin to something you'd pick up at a dollar store."
3,LED Flashlight,The light output on these LED flashlights is really good but the on/off switch is made very cheap and won't last long
4,"So far, so good with mine","This flashlight works well for me. I have not had any problems as others have mentioned...about lights flickering. As a law enforcement officer, this light is very close to being one l.e.d. that I can actually use on duty. One thing to make it better, would be a dead man switch."
4,Great Light,"This light worked very well for a few weeks. It works well now except every few minutes it goes dull, and I have to hit it against my hand a few times to bring it back to full brightness. Great price though!!! I'd recommend it."
1,DOA,"Received one of these as a gift, it failed to work from the very beginning.The battery compartment is completely without label as to how the batteries are supposed to be installed, and in spite of trying all possible variations of battery orientation, I get absolutely no response when I press the button."
2,Not what I expected,I was wanting more light and this one all the lights did not seem to work right. Not very practical
1,Neiko 40290 Super bright Flashlight,"Neiko 40290 Super-Bright 21-LED Aluminum Flashlight, Gunmetal SilverThis is the worst flashlight that I have ever bought. This thing would not come on when I put the batteries in. Finially got it to burn but now it flickers or goes off just when you need it the worst. I would not recamend it to anyone. This is not a product of Amazon quality. If I ran Amazon I would pull it off my shelves.disappointed,Frank"
2,"Great light output, horrible flickering","As mentioned in other reviews, the amount of light put out by this flashlight is surprisingly strong for such a small unit. However, the flickering is unbearable and shaking it or adjusting the contacts don't seem to make any meaningful difference. It's virtually unusable for me and very annoying. I want to like this very portable flashlight, but I wouldn't recommend it. I'm going to look toward more expensive, hopefully more reliable, LEDs."
4,GIANT Light - Small Package' Flashlight - 21 LED! Gunmetal Silver,"I have used this flashlight for over a month and my observations are:1) Very powerful light. Much brighter than it's smaller 9-LED sibling.2) Good for taking out at night while walking the dog. Will light up the immediate area.3) Don't expect this light to illuminate anything more than 30 feet away.4) Great value for the money. Don't waste your time with the 9-LED version.5) Comes with batteries, but don't expect high quality brands.6) The structural quality is fine. I didn't experience the ""flimsiness"" that other people wrote about.7) Small and compact. Powerful for its size.Bottom line: You can't beat this flashlight for its price. Not the best light I've seen, but definitely worth the price.UPDATE!! I have had this flashlight for almost a year now and it is rapidly dying (no, it's not the batteries). I put in fresh batteries and the lights are still very dim. I won't be buying another one."
3,switch doesn't always work,"Sometimes it takes six or more tries for the light to switch on. When it does come on it, all of the LEDs produce a bright, clear light"
5,Super bright!!!,"I just got this flashlight today, and im super happy with it. Im going to use it at clubs and the light is great...really shines like a big flashlight but so compact and light"
1,safety goggles?????,"I wish the web page had said it came with a warning to ""always wear ANSI approved safety goggles when using product."" The product also says ""Before using this product, the user should read the operating instructions"" but of course it didn't come with any operating instructions. I thought my kid could take it to camp, but now I wonder if it will blind somebody."
3,Just as what I thought,"Good, useful if you don;t have a compact flashlight. But you cannot adjust the range of the light. The reason I gave only 3 star is that I saw some cheaper price on other sites."
5,Great little flashlight,Very bright. I can't believe it only costs $8. Works perfectly and even comes with batteries.
4,Giant light in a small package,"I bought several of these for gifts and the receivers are happy. It's very well constructed and palm size. For the ladies it can be carried in the purse and makes a great light to walk to the car in a parking lot. The brightness would temp blind an attacker if the need arose.With the 21 LED's it gives off a very bright light and covers a larger area that you would expect. If you desire a small, well made, bright flashlight that you can depend on, this is the one."
5,This is a very nice flashlight,If you are looking for flashlight that is small and produces a very bright light then this is for you.Great value. I've purchased several of these and all of them work flawlessly.The covered on/off switch on the bottom of the flashlight makes it easy to operate with one hand.
2,get less than what I paid,"when it's $8, you get what you pay.Amonzon always increases the price when they get good reviews, so the price is more than $11.Now I got less than what I paid. Fit and finish is not that good and it gets hot for 10 min use. Light is bright but it flickers sometimes."
2,Gets Too Hot to Hold,"I bought this light to use as handy light for my job. It is small and comes with a holster I can put on my safety belt. The light is rugged, well finished and very bright. However after about 10 minutes, it gets too hot to hold. The heat starts creeping back from the LEDs in the front of the light after a few minutes. It little while later, you can't even hold it. It's fine for short duration use, but that is all. I have since retired this light to home use. The most I'll use it for is looking under the couch for my kids toys. Luckily, I also bought the 9 LED version. It is more cheaply made, isn't as bright but doesn't get hot. I now use the 9 LED model at work with the holster that came with the 21 LED model."
2,Flicker Flicker,"The good, sturdy, very bright light when not flickeringthe bad, flickers from dim to bright, can not find a loose contact.Can not recommend"
4,Great Light,"This is actually the second time I have bought one of these lights (the first works fine but I needed another). I have had some flicker problems with the first, but none with this second. This second one works perfectly and throws out a lot of light using very little power. I am pleased and would buy yet again if I needed another. I subtract 1 star (giving 4 instead of 5) because of the flicker problems with the first, which I have had for over a year, and the pricing does seem a few dollars higher on Amazon than what I have seen elsewhere. 4 stars"
4,Bright light,This little flashlight suprised me. It is blindingly bright (i found this out the hard way) and can lighten an entire dark room. The one thing i would've like to seen on this light was some sort of focuser or rim on the front of the light becuase the light disperses a lot without one.
3,Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers,"Love it, love it, love it!! It's continuously upbeat with each and every track and perfect for all parties and any type happy occasions where there's music. Most of the music's familiar to everyone, and I would dare anyone to not tap their toes or move to the beat!"
1,poorly done arrangements,"was very disappointed in this cd, very poorly done arrangements, very poor sound, all over BAD. Save your money!"
4,great music,Very true to it's name. It is a master mix of some very great music.They did a wonderful job on all music genres.
5,More Fun with Jive Bunny,This is an excellent addition to any collection of music. The music is very well done and I really enjoy how Jive Bunny transitions the music from one song to the next. Glad Amazon suggested this along with the Swing The Mood CD I was hunting.George
4,Jive Bunny Rocks,This CD really rocks. Very good for dancing. Recommened for listening and dj play. Just select the tracks and watch the people have a ball.
1,Don't buy,"What a terrible album. It sounds like a bunch of drunk chickens. If you were expecting sounds similar to that of the original Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers: The Album, you will be very disappointed! I should not even give this one star. Now I have to sell it."
2,Rerecordings of classic music,"Just a heads-up: There are a ton of different compilations of Temptations music; I'm not a fan of this one because rather than the classic original or remastered original recordings it contains new ones by, as the sparse liner notes say at the very end, ""a line-up including the original Temptations member, Eddie Kendricks"" - based on other reviews, I just ordered the ""My Girl: Best of..."" collection and will get rid of this one."
3,Not what I expected...,"I bought this cookbook because of the raving reviews on this page, and because I needed something that made veggie cooking faster and easier, so that it would better mesh with my lifestyle. I am a very busy person. I was very disappointed to find this is just another vegetarian cookbook. Long lists of ingredients, no photos, same old, same old. It'll go back on my shelf. I'll just stick to the Seventh Day Adventist's Diet's recipes - lots of veggie recipes in there and they focus on easy meals, like haystacks. This was a waste of money, but I spent it in good faith."
3,The Lost Ed Wood Film!,"For years this movie languished at the film lab, because Ed couldn't afford the developing fees! When it's bail was finally paid, the world could finally see the final film in the Kelton the Cop trilogy. This is a kind of sequel to Bride of the Monster, which plays very loose with the facts of that film. A fake medium has set up shot in Lugosi's old house - rebuilt I suppose - Lobo (Tor Johnson) survived its destruction and is still lumbering around, for some reason Kelton the cop has not been fired, there's a couple of ghosts running around, and let's not forget - Criswell in a coffin! Surprisingly, Wood shows a fair amount of competence in the filmmaking department, but at the cost of his usual outrageous gaffes and overwrought dialogue, which makes his other efforts so enjoyable to the fan of bad cinema."
3,Great if you like cheesy movies,"This movie was made on the cheap, really cheap. Don't expect Plan 9 from outer space quality. It's a notch or two below that. I still found it entertaining in its own way."
1,Painfully Bad Wood,"The Ed Wood Stock Company returns in this ""so bad, it's bad"" follow-up to ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" Unlike previous Woodian schlockfests, ""Night of the Ghouls"" (1959) is depressing no-budget hackery. Poor Kenne Duncan gets saddled with the Bela Lugosi role while Criswell narrates the uneventful proceedings from a coffin! Some lab fees are better left unpaid."
5,One of the best SF novels I have ever read.,"John W. Campbell's formula for great science fiction was, famously, ""ask the <em>next</em> question."" That's exactly what this bracing, challenging, bleak, funny, deeply subversive novel does, elegantly undercutting decades of unexamined science-fiction adventure cliches.Recommended for anyone who ever wanted to lay into Compulsory Optimism with a meat ax. ""The human race is fine. We're just not there."""
1,Dead boring.,"This a story of a woman being bored to death. Really, she dies of it. There are some other characters to begin with, but they're a bit boring and she kills them half way through the book. Then we're left with this murderer, and her morbid fascination with, well, death, and her slow, well, death. There's that D word again. The book's actually more interesting then it sounds, but it's still dead boring. The writing is pretty good, but really, the plot is a killer. There's nothing going on, and the murderer's morbid thoughts and recollections are not that interesting, especially as the sane reader will probably not sympathize with the one and only character offered in the second half of the book.Other reviewers seemed awed by the fact this book deals with, you guessed it, death. This book should have been killed in its infancy."
1,Charger does not work with R225 cell phone,This charger does not plug into the R225 cell phone. The R225 cell phone has a micro USB connector. This charger does not have a micro USB connector.
1,charger,"Worked well for a few months, but is cheaply made and died shortly thereafter. I would not recommend to buy."
3,First model did not work - but great customer service,"I gave this 3 stars because the first one that arrived did not work at all. I have to admit though that I E-mailed customer service and not only did they immediately respond, but the sent out a replacement immediately, overnight, and sent an RMA tag to return the defective unit.The 2nd unit worked as promised - a little light on the qulaity construction (not flimsy, but not stout like the OEM charger from ATT).Overall I would give it a 4"
4,Good to have many recharge t//o/y/s/ tools,"Since batteries don't seem to ever last as long as one might like between charging, no matter how long that may be, it's good to have multiple options for recharging on the go.This car charger is exactly the thing."
4,Photo history of Vietnam,"As photographer and Vietnam vet appreciate Page's photos. A must for anybody interested in Vietnam is Michael Herr's Dispatches. I must have read it ten times. It catches the humor, horror and pathos of our misadventure. For a modern look at what went wrong and why a must is the very recent The Generals, which I have on audiobook, and will soon get Kindle edition."
3,Too Much of a Good Thing.,"Having read and enjoyed all the earlier books in this series, I expected to enjoy this one too. But Ms. Swanson has upped the level of everything in this latest book. We're told more than we need to know about Skye Denison's lovelife with her bland boyfriend, Simon, who no longer even worries about her tendency to place herself in danger. And the number of acts of violence in 250 pgs. are mind boggling. Skye's brother is battered several times. A musician is killed, the school is set on fire. A student is shut up in a locker, another has to be taken from the school's roof before he jumps, Skye's car is run off the road, a woman is shot dead, and most annoying of all, Skye keeps stupidly putting herself in jeopardy by going off on her own to investigate such things as methamphetamine labs without anyone knowing where she's going. All this in a town of only a few thousand citizens. It's all too much. I won't rush out to get the next installment."
3,Goot top but lost it's song...,This was a great top for about the first year but eventually it stopped singing and would only make a single tone no matter how often I had oiled it in it's lifetime.
2,Dated and oddly organized,"This book comes with several strong promotional promises, most of which are over-promised and under-delievered. The book is written in a way that becomes stale quickly - particularly in its use of web-sites and pointing out sites and content that are not dynamic and now several years old. I have no doubt that Ms. Burwell knows her stuff -- it is just that she hasn't provided a well-organized means for communicating it to the reader. This book might be better if it were updated regularly, but I do not see annual editions of it available, which would have helped."
2,Burwell Coasting on Her Laurels?,"Helen Burwell does have credibility, given her credentials, but I have to admit that I was REALLY disappointed -- in reviewing recommended sites, I found myself often wondering why a site was included in a particular section, or why it was included at all, and why some wonderful sites weren't mentioned period. Perhaps this would be a useful starting point for a beginner, but if you consider yourself an experienced researcher, you'll do better to rely on your own set of bookmarks."
1,Waste of money,If you've looked at this book and you think it's complete - you're right - it's completely wrong. Many of the songs have incorrect tab and chord listings. I have compared many of the songs in the book to how Harrison plays them in the Concert for Bangladesh and the chords are definitely wrong. If you're looking for George Harrison guitar tablature that is correct don't buy this one.
2,don't buy it,Don't buy this book. The chords and notations are incorrect. If you have seen the Concert for Bangla Desh you will know the song My Sweet Lord is incorrect. Songs like Here Comes the Sun are difficult to read. If you are looking for George Harrison guitar tab find another book!
2,this movie sucked juevos rancheros,"if you liked classic 80s Chase, like Vacation or Three Amigos, heck, i'll even throw in Deal of the Century.... then you might think this movie really makes you gasp while reaching for your pelvic region... but then again... you could enjoy Curley with his crazy greying hair trying to relive the glory of City Slickers. but unlike slickers, this movie's ""one thing"" that every man must realize is that Chase couldn't even save this one, baby."
2,Not Karaoke,"I bought this CD because I thought that it was a karaoke CD, and it wasn't. I put it in my karaoke machine, and there were no words, then I thought it would maybe work in a DVD player, and it didn't. This is only background vocals of the songs and not a CD with the words on it for karaoke machines."
4,gold star,"Lyrically and musically, Expansion Team equals if not surpasses The Platform. The only thing keeping this album from five stars is its similarity to Dilated Peoples' debut. It's armed with the same underground heavy hitter guests, thoughtful lyrics, and some serious, serious beats. So when hip-hop is this good, who cares? Dilated peoples will be around long enough to push their artistic expansion further."
5,DILATED'S BACK,This album is definity some dope sh*t. It has got the same tight flows of platform with even better production. Better peep this.
4,"For the peoples, by the Peoples","With the release of Expansion Team, Dilated Peoples just might finally show the world what the ""underground"" hip-hop world has been unleashing for years. More group-hop scratch rap than the pop coming from Ja Rule and P. Diddy these days, Dilated speaks of what they know and that includes some of the groundwork of what started rap.The first track shows the live ability of the group while orchestrated tracks like ""Heavy Rotation"" show the studio sound of the Peoples is where the meat and potatoes really are. More Roots and City High than anything else, the Dilated Peoples are on the fore front of scratch rap. The turntables spin, the rhymes come out, and the final product is a very entertaining album. Hip hop fans take note, Dilated Peoples are poking their heads above ground, and you WILL hear from these guys soon."
2,Strong Production Here & There - Weak Lyrics Abound,"Los Angeles's suburban backpacker hip-hop darlings Dilated Peoples' 2nd full length (""Expansion Team"") is a marked improvement over their debut ""The Platform."" However, the major problem plaguing this outfit continues to act as a scourge -namely Evidence's inability to compose rhymes of reason/logic/dexterity. To compound this dilemma, Irascience's lyrics this time 'round are almost as weak as Evidence's (is it any wonder why Evidence 1st started out as a grafitti artist?). The Beat Junkies' DJ Babu holds his own and the crew is ably assisted by some of the better producers out there (DJ Premier/Da Beatminerz/Joey Chavez/The Alchemist - although the beat for ""Worst Come To Worst"" definitely isn't as hot as the Jadakiss/Rass Kass number). It's too bad that ""Target Practice"" didn't make the cut owing to an uncleared sample - its inclusion would have bolstered a somewhat so-so outing from these west coast mainstays."
2,"Sorry, but not a big fan of Evidence and Iriscience","Am I the only one who thinks Evidence tries to sound hard, like he's Ice-T or something? As if that hard edge authenticates his street knowledge. Iriscience, well, look at his name..iris + science...wow, that's deep bro. He tries to kick knowledge type rhymes, but is seriously flawed in coming up with something creative. I really wish I could be a fan though. The beats are slick, and Babu really saves these two MCs with his turntables. And it's cool when he's scratching over the chorus ""a dangerous man who can speak with his hands"", then mixes that. These guys would be better off just playing hip hop with a vibe (such as people under the stairs) rather than the tired cycle of Evidence battle rhyming followed by Iriscience trying to, i don't know, look at stuff with his iris. Check out Hieroglyphics and/or Blackalicious for stuff that Dilated tries to be like."
5,A VERY GOOD CD,"i personally think that this cd is a bit better than the platform. both cd's are really rockin, but this one just sets on fire. it could do without all the shouts to the beat junkies throughout places in the album, but thats no biggie. if youre looking for a cd that has excellent beats, good lyrics, and just damn good-pick this cd up"
3,Late night company...,"Dilated Peoples are a good band.They try to make nice and honest hip-hop and not the .... hip-hop that's all over the billboard charts!They are obviously influenced by A Tribe Called Quest,De La soul,The Beatnutts and other 90s underground hip-hop acts.So far,so good...Expansion Team is good,but the thing is it doesn't add anything new to the underground movement.It's all been played before by others.The record has a good flow but only a few songs reach perfection(songs like the first single 'Worst Comes To Worst','Proper Propagandha','Pay Attention','Expansion Team Theme' and the short but impressive 'Deffari Interlude'.)The album has downtempo beats all over the place and is great for late night conversations.It won't change hip-hop but on the other hand it doesn't disgrace it either and judging by today's standards that alone is an accomplishment!"
3,good album,"good album, beats and song content is good but i think evidence can step his lyrics up just a lillte bit and his voice is a little annoying, but babu is the man, iriscience is dope too"
5,Spread the News!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is the best CD I have ever bought, and every song is great. If you think Im lying, go buy it I promise youll like it. The scratching is great, the rhymes are perfect, and they even got special guests like tha Liks to hook something up with them. I give this cd a Perfect Score. Favorite songs....Heavy Rotation and Defari Interlude.Later. Matt S."
4,A Must-Buy!,"Way better than their debut album! Live on stage, the introductory track with amazing melody, beat and scratching, was featured in the NBA Street Vol 2 soundtrack. This is proof of how good it is. Most people will have heard their single Worst comes to worst, which has elements of ""Growing pains"", by Ludacris. Again amazing. With strong lyrical exposure, they hold their views geniunely and are not afraid to say them out loud, unlike others who just say what the public want to hear, or just try to sound hard. Dilated Peoples have finally been given some respect and recognition. Big up Evidence, Babu and Rakaa!"
3,"Good, but ""The Platform"" is 10 times better","What they hell is up with that ""Trade Money"" song. How played out does that ISH sound!!! Let Jay-Z do that type of ISH. Dilated, this CD is bangin but the lyrics are a little bit off. Peace"
4,four and a half stars,"Dilated's last album had a very fitting title. ""The Platform"" was just that- a platform from which they were only beginning. While i liked the last album, something about it didn't quite reach the heights that I wanted it to reach. I was expecting the same from ""Expansion Team"". A set of decent, but not over-whelming, ""underground"" hip hop. I can now say that Dilated have shown us that they are on the way to becoming more than just a decent run-of-the-mill hiphop group. This album completely surprised me. Right away, it got me in a way that only Platform's very best tracks could. This album is one of the year's best. The production is stepped up. The rhymes are more diverse. Evidence and Rakka have a greater sense of purpose, are more focused, and are just having a lot more fun. This is the beginning of a good hip hop group turning into a great hip hop group. Expansion indeed."
3,album needs expansion,"I listened to the platform, pure classic. This album is totally boring, black thought from my main crew and questlove couldnt even rescue this album from the boredom this album represents. After the first three tracks its totally boring. Buy it if youre a real dilated fan or leave it alone."
4,"Dialated.. ""heavy rotated""","I like the anthem... ""When worse comes to Worse""And there are some solid tracks on this LP But I need more from This group.. I loved the First album.. Simply Cause I Checked it more.. Ev is just not doing it for me these Days with his Ryhming.. But Rakka is still on point.. and DJ BABU makes beats that rival anything today..ill keep playing this tho.. let me discover some hidden GEM"
3,Not worth the money,"I learned a couple things from the video, but it didn't show everything that was claimed it shows. The title says training miniature horses for halter and it barely mentions it. It goes more into halter obstacle. The video is poor quality and not worth the money."
5,Tender and beautiful Easter book................,"In this world of violent cartoons and scary movies for children, this gentle story is a must for youngsters."
4,Beautiful short story,"A very interesting story with a puzzling ending, I especially liked the understanding that Traven has of the meaning of death in the mexican culture.A man goes into the woods and meets the Death, they make a pact, a series of events follow until Macario dies many years later, or did he die the same day he met the Death?, you find out.I really recomend this book for everyone, combine it with Canasta de Cuentos Mexicanos, these two books really make for some of Traven's best."
4,Fascinating novelization of a Mexican folktale,"Great for intermediate students or adults. Goes through a lot of Mexican culture in a very accessible Mexican Spanish. Poor woodcutter Macario meets the devil, Jesus, and Death on the day his wife cooks him the first filling meal of his life. They all want a bite of his turkey. He makes a deal with Death, that makes him wealthy, but later puts him in hot water with the Inquisition. Humor, irony, adventure, and philosophy. It can be compared with a wonderful B&W movie."
1,For someone wanting an introduction to Persian don't bother.,"For a scholarly detailed and obscure grammar look no further. If you want a guide to how Persian was written in the 10th century your on to a winner. For those who know Arabic, this work is comparable to Wright's grammar with little excercises and unbearably long vocabulary lists at the end of every section, followed by a collection of largely unannotated prose passages at the end of the book. The last half of the book is dedicated exclusively to explaining Arabic grammar that the student of the modern language scarcely needs. Alas I have never got that far. Every time I've picked up this tome, I've put it down again before completing Chapter 10. This book is for the advanced student only, and the more pedantic one at that. Beginners use Thackston, you won't regret it."
3,Car Freshener - Good,"Tried this air freshner and found it good. It resembles the new car smell, however, it could be stronger in scent."
5,The best Matlab book available.,"Version 6 of Matlab is improved in graphic use interface and efficiency of computation as well as compatibility with other languages like C++. ""Mastering MATLAB 6"" is the best choice of book on Matlab for its detailed coverage on graphics and interface with other programming languages. Only weakness of Matlab is its capability of analytical computation, and it is preferred to use Maple for analytical calculation. The most respected programming book on Maple is ""Maple Programming Guide"". ""Mastering MATLAB 6"" and ""Maple Programming Guide"" are the investment which you will not regret."
5,Great book for MATLAB beginners,"This is the best book I have read about MATLAB. It covers as many topics as possible for beginners. It is written in a simple and clear format. The examples given in the book are explained step by step with the commands printed out. The summaries, tables and important notes are also listed out for the learner easy to understand. In conclusion, it is a well organized book and reference."
1,...The Matlab online help is better,"...The Matlab online help is better... If you've never used Matlab, C++, Fortran and are in high school (freshman), and want to get ready for college, don't buy this book. Buy the student version of Matlab and use the online help, it's just as good as this book. GUIs are barely even discussed (version 6) in this book. The GUIDE section (GUI creater) is 12 lines long. Why would anyone buy this book? The GUI section looks like it is right off the help screen.....yada, yada, ya......"
1,Messianic Jewish Deception,"WHat this translation reflects is the inherent dishonesty of the Messianic Jewish Movement. There is abslutely nothing Jewish about this book and it has absolutely nothing to do with Orthodox Judaism. It is a 100% Christian book with a Christian translation teaching Christianity. The New Testament (yes, ""Brit Chadashah"" is just an attempt to hide the fact that this is nothing more than the Christian New Testament) is not a Jewish document, has never been a Jewish document and has absolutely nothing to do with Judaism of an kind. I was given a copy of this book by a Messianic Jew trying to prove to me that it was still Judaism- it had the opposite effect and just reinforced my notion of the dishonesty and deceit employed by the Messianic Jewish movement"
1,Outright Lie,This book is a shameless attempt to masquerade Christianity and feed it to unwitting Jews who think it is Jewish. The title says it is Orthodox Jewish but it is no such thing. It is the Christian New Testament and is the foundation of the Christian religion. All Jews are warned not to read this book if you are looking for information on Judaism. Respectable people from all religions should be outraged at this blatant attempt to fool people into worshipping another religion. Those looking for information about Judaism are advised to read Aryeh Kaplan's Handbook of Jewish Thought and The Real Messiah.
1,Don't be conned,"So Philip Goble had a good idea. Dress up the New Testament as though it is an Orthodox Jewish book, use the words Orthodox and Jewish in the title and just may be someone Jewish might be conned into buying it. This is a Christian book; there is nothing Orthodox or Jewish about it and Jewish buyers should beware."
1,Misleading,"This book is very misleading in that its title reads ""Orthodox Jewish"" while its content are pure Christianity. It is evidently an attempt to draw unwitting Jewish readers into Christianity without letting them know upfront. Readers should beware and consult with knowledgeable rabbis while contemplating the issues in this Christian book."
1,Don't get taken,"Don't be fooled this is just another one of J for J's (Jews for Jesus) messy antics. It is a X-tian bible translated into ""Yeshivish"" in a bold effort to convert not the unafiliated Jews, but Orthodox Jews, even Hasidim as well! ""The Bersuras HaGelula according to Mattiyahu"" = The gospel according to Matthew. ""Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach"" (I'll give you 3 guesses - see my first sentence) The publisher's goal is to deceive. The name of their ministry is clearly deceptive - (artists for Israel international) Jewish People be warned!"
3,Lost spaghetti,"This pot is best used for large items you want to boil and drain; I got it for the venting/draining feature when cooking spaghetti, so I wouldn't have to use a colander (and wash it). However, there is a gap between the lid and the pot, so I've seen some spaghetti go down the drain through that gap. Might be OK for ziti or anything large, maybe even macaroni. On the plus side, it has kept its new appearance for 4 years, and is an adequate size."
3,"loved this pot, then the handle fell off","We used this pot for several years and loved it, especially the thick bottom and the straining feature (though I agree with others here that you end up losing lots of spaghetti through the strainer if you're not careful). We used it for making popcorn quite often, which required some shaking to keep the popcorn from burning. All that shaking made the handle fall off. The handles are spot welded in 8 or nine places, but all of the welds seem to have broken.The manufacturer says they won't fix it because it's older than a year.Summary: this pot is awesome but if you shake it too much after a few years the handle falls off."
4,"Good ,serviceable pot",First one was damaged beyondsalvation but second pot was first rate merchandise. The pot is great and I like the straining features built into the lid. There is a design flaw in that the lid does not completely seal the pot and a lot of vapor is lost when doing long recipes. There are better pots but for the money this one does an excellant job.
1,Probably one of the worst one ever!!,I have all the dream dance collection. I would rate this one to be the worst of all. I only like one of the songs out of the whole two cds.
5,Fantastic,"Worth a buy for the history buff. Well done! My favorite part was the Mystic Battle piece and the commentary that made a great deal of sense,"
2,karaoke words not included in CD,"We have a great Karaoke machine so when we bought tons of Karaoke CD's it was a blast until we found this one doesn't have the words on the screen, it's just the backing music and no clue when to start or what to sing unless you know the song well and can read the words from the small insert."
2,Out of date,Definitely out of datePublished in 1995Ten pages on the internet today is useless.Almost all the equipment is out of date.Did get a couple of usefull ideas thus the 2 star rating
3,About half out of date,The advent of widespread digital devices has rendered much of the information here obsolete. Needs a new revision.
5,Definitive spy source book,"After reading this book, I have no doubt Lee Lapin has the drop on the information gathering business. For those in the business, it is a well rounded guide for data access and equipment useage in conducting investigations. For the novice, it provides great insight and a useful tool for individuals doing their own investigations. A fun to read book cover to cover. I was very pleased with A1 books who sold the used book through the marketplace. The book was in great shape for used and looked brand new!"
2,mixing genres lost me,"Trying to mix Benigni's over-hysteric bufoonery with a Woodyallenesqe love comedy with the trauma of the Iraq war didn't come together well. I didn't find it funny, sad or touching."
1,Trite,"This movie is confounding. It attempts to be serious, funny, and romantic at all times, but is mediocre in each aspect. Don't get me started on the overly preachy ""symbolism"" that is rank within the movie. ""oooh! a tiger in the middle of the street. How mystical!""A joke of a movie. The quality of something one would view for free on public television at 2 A.M."
3,Decent movie,"This is a decent though quite a mediocre movie. My favourite actor plays the main role. Roberto Benigni, isn't he a little bit like Pierre Richard? I always associated these two guys as they somehow are similar. Both are my favourite actors. The movie is clearly against any kind of invasion and war and is created to send a message across. If you sleep through the middle of the movie (I did, unintentionally) you will not understand what it all was about. Once you watch it entirely and especially the second time, you will understand, it's a good movie. Three stars only for the overall movie, but I give 5 stars for the actors and for the acting and 5 stars for the anti-war topic."
5,Robert Begnini,If you love Begnini's movies this is one of the best. I truly adore it. Its quotes and situations dipected are now part of my daily life
3,Too Much Benigni,"A little bit of Roberto Benigni goes a long way, and in The Tiger And the Snow there is a lot more than a little bit of Benigni. The are a number of truly touching moments in the film, and a wonderful sequence early on when Beningi the teacher is lecutring his students on poetry and language. All of this makes the film worth seeing. However, for those not tuned into Benigni's antic acting style, his manic energy can quickly become frustrating and annoying. Benigni the director cannot seem to control Benigni the actor, and Benigni the writer does not seem to realize that Benigni the actor is much more effective when he is surrounded by other strong characters. There's just too much solo Benigni in this film."
4,I loved it,"I saw this movie before I saw Life is Beautiful and really loved it. I had no expectations and had no idea what it was about, and was pleasantly surprised. It's not as deep as Life is Beautiful but it is similar in some ways - the silliness of Roberto Benigni, the love story part, the sadness from a war. I think I enjoyed it more than Life is Beautiful (although I do think Life is Beautiful is a better movie) because I had no expectations and I really have trouble watching any movie about concentration camps in WWII. I recommend it."
5,A Masterpiece That Only Benigni Could Orchestrate,"The Tiger and the Snow is brilliant. Roberto Benigni has incredible energy, wit and intelligence. This movie is poetry in motion. He can bring sadness and comedy into the same moment. As a script, The Tiger and the Snow is creative, well plotted and has a near flawless structure. Benigni is highly underrated for this particular work; maybe because it takes place in Iraq, maybe because there's a bias against ""foreign"" films in America. Whatever the reason, if you are a lover of good quality work, this is a highly recommended movie. And I haven't even started on Benigni's gift for comedy. Or the magic that Nicoletta Braschi brings to the screen. Or Jean Renoir's ever-present charisma. What a fantastic film."
4,Beautiful lens for the price,"This lens looked like the perfect fit for a walk around lens (whatever the hell that means. Are there crawl around lenses? Or sleep around lenses? Just figured Id use the buzz word) so I decided to pick one up. I have been amazed at the results it produces for just over $200 dollars. I use the lens on my E1 and could not be happier. Sharp as a tack, and great contrast. I noticed that another reviewer was dissapointed with this lens on an E500. Maybe that body uses a different metering system? Maybe his meter was set wrong? Dosent make sense. It aint no Zuiko, but it aint no $900 either. I have the 50-200 too, but this one is much quieter, and produces a generally better picture. I wrote to Sigma and told them that I would gladly pay another C note or two for more quality and speed. Why dont you too? I paid right around $200 dollars for my 50-200 Sigma. The 50-200 Zuiko was around $1200 but I hear it has dropped in price. They can stick them until they hit around 4 bills."
3,beauty scenery & the apes,i like the continuity-lots of different closeup and wideview visual scenery/scenes; the story is decent with ape action in the beginning and suprisingly in the end when you thought it may have been edited out. but it wasnt. so far the best ed wood film ive seen; and good dvd pic quality. good differently done.
1,"Sorry, Terri. Fed Up is RIGHT!",Queensryche sucks. So does this album. One star is all it gets. Now save your cash and wait for Jessica Simpson's new album due in August.
3,"Recommended by a co-worker, I think we both missed the mark","As the book says, this is written by a ""business person"" from that point of view. It isn't a techie book on networking like ""TCP/IP Illustrated"" (Stevens) or ""Computer Networks"" (Tanenbaum). I felt pretty let down, but that's probably more due to my expectations (I mentioned to a co-worker that I needed to brush up on my understanding of networking, as my current level of knowledge isn't cutting it after a job move, he recommended this book (and he owned an ISP at one point, so I figured it'd deliver in spades...sadly, it is more suited to ""business people"" looking to gain an understanding of networking.))."
5,Better Than Networking For Dummies,I'm a big fan of the Dummies series and never thought I'd find anything to compete with it except for the Idiot's Guides. I was wrong. I found this book covers the topic much better than the Dummies and Idiot's guides. The author writes in my kind of language - plain and simple so the average guy can understand. And the indepth coverage of the industry is a bonus. I really like the author's down to earth style of writing. This is a buy.
5,DVD,If you live in the USA the PAL DVD's won't work unless you have a all region DVD player.You can buy them here an Amazon for $34.00
2,would have liked it,i ordered this but couldn't play it because it was region two and i am not. would have like it i am sure since i love michael ball. will sell the item on my daughters site because i hate returning things.
1,NOT MARKED PAL AND IT WON'T PLAY ON U. S. SYSTEMS,THIS DISC IS NOT MARKED CORRECTLY WILL NOT PLAY ON U. S. SYSTEMS ONLY FOR PAL PLAYERS AND IT IS NOT IN THE DESCRIPTION. AMAZON NEEDS TO FIX THIS AND I'M RETURNING MINE. I LOVE HIM AND WISH THEY WOULD BE SMART ENOUGH TO LET US SEE HIS CONCERTS.
1,Where's the yerba mate?,"Yogi Tea has done yerba mate a disservice with this product. The rich, earthy flavor of the mate is simply drowned out beneath the same chai spices (i.e., cardamom, cinnamon, clove, ginger, and black pepper) that Yogi Tea uses in most of its other blends. If you love the taste of yerba mate, look elsewhere."
4,"Funny album, with a metal touch!!!","This album is along the lines of Tenacious D, Green Jello, Gwar, Spanker, and Stormtroopers of Death (with less of a hardcore EDGE). For fans of both of those bands, you wil likely like this. This is more of a new metal sound (at times sounding like hatebreed, system of a down, and other times like the above metnioned bands). With short bursting riffs and songs, this album is highlighted by the songs Scrotal Torment, Death Burger, Beer, Prozak Milkshake, and Fake My Own Death and Go Platinum, this band pokes fun at pop cutlure, previous artists and art culture, and cultural taboos. Formed in Pheonix Arizona, in about 2000, this group a kids brings new energy back into comedy music that has lacked for some years now. Pick this up if you are a fan of the above bands, you will dig this."
1,Thank goodness for audio samples,"Way too much vibrato!!! Stay away. You won't hear the actual music. Get the Hilliard ensemble recording or some other group you can trust to sing the music with the correct technique and style, i.e. senza vibrato. I'm glad I could listen to the audio sample: now I know not to buy and waste money. I'd rather pay more for something I can listen to."
2,Disaster movie as a book,"This book has been a great disappointment. I have read everything McDevitt has written thus far and I must say this is by far the weakest book. To me, it is nothing more than a printed disaster movie. It takes an exceptionally unlikely event and spins it into a story filled with a decent amount of action, but populated by a host of forgettable characters. While reading it I realized that I really did not care much whether any of the too many poorly sketched people in the book lived or died. I honestly did not even care whether the human race would make it. Overall, very forgettable."
3,McDevitt does a decent job with a tired theme.,"Moonfall is an engaging story. McDevitt dosen't cover any new ground here; Niven, Benford and others have doen the same. Moonfall throws a twist in the theme by having the Moon get hit, not Earth (at first). Being a fan of his work I certianly enjoyed Moonfall, but he has yet to fulfill the promise of Engines of God. Worth reading. Dane Carlson."
3,"Enjoyable, but some missed opportunities","This was a good summer read but McDevitt misses some chances to make it more than that. Granted, the characters are fighting for their lives, but nowhere is the emotional impact of losing the moon as we know it really even mentioned. McDevitt also throws the characters at you with introductions that read like ""John Doe was a grim, taciturn man of 40 with a receding hair line and glasses."" How about spreading that out a little? ""John Doe pulled off his glasses and wiped the sweat off his receding hair line."" Rather than tell us he's grim and taciturn, SHOW us.Anyway, I generally like McDevitt's work and ""Moonfall"" is no exception. ""Engines of God"" is better, but this is a good light read."
4,Kindle version needs work!,"I love this book; I must have read it ten times, and get a thrill every time. My complaint is that the Kindle version is riddled with misspellings and/or formatting problems. It starts off really clean but at around 45% the mistakes get to be noticeable and at around 86% they kick into high gear (at least three per page). I hope Amazon is looking into these problems and will correct them in the future. That being said, even with the all but unreadable ending I still give it four stars. It's THAT good!"
2,FAST TO PEICES...,"I picked up and put down this book in one day. I read from cover to cover and when I was done, I gave it away... with a warning, this book misses the mark by a long chalk. Slow to build, quick to end, this book seems to have been written at the pace of a last second Hail Mary term paper. There's a great idea here toally killed by the conference type writing by McDevitt. Everyone in this book seems to be stuck in committee... talking just to pass the time until the disaster actually passes them by. And boy, does this disaster pass them by. McDevitt wastes no time by the last quarter of this book to totally gloss over any actual destruction on Earth, by the last page a year has passed since the Moonfall, and everything... and I mean everything, is just peachy! Bypass this book if you can, it literally reads like it was meant to be produced for television."
2,No real surprises,"A few years ago I read a book called A TALENT FOR WAR by this guy called Jack McDevitt. I read the whole thing in a day and it has been one of my favorites ever since. After that I read every McDevitt book I could get hold of.Unfortunatly the rest of his books have not grabed me the way A TALENT FOR WAR did and MOONFALL is no exception. I found most of the characters very calm and almost bored with the fact that a giant comet is going to destroy the moon and possibly lead to earth's destruction. In fact they are far more interested in insurance, money and in the case of the vice president getting re-elected.There is very little sence of urgency in this book, it reads more like a report on a casual fishing trip. Also you know right from the start what the whole story was going to be about there were no surprises, no unexpected twists everything that you expected to happen happened.Oh well I can always read A TALENT FOR WAR again. Now there is a good book."
2,Not a good book,"I liked the premise - tidal waves caused by a comet exploding the moon. What I did not understand is why the author continued to introduce new (and minor) characters up until the last few pages of the book! There was no reason I could see related to the story, or the characters that we already knew by then. This was distracting, confusing, and I did not enjoy it. This book made me tired."
2,A Beach Book,"OK, I read this 500+ page book in two days. But, it was like ""Airport"" in space. I knew that almost everyone would live happily ever after and I still turned page after page. I kept asking myself why I continued reading and the answers I came up with were it was easy to read and it allowed me to escape holidays under the threat of terrorism and war. It would make a great summer movie."
1,Boring,"This book is simply boring, looks like the script for the next independance day. It should make a lot of money with Hollywood"
4,I couldn't put it down!,"This is absoloutley one of the best SF I have ever read. A real page turner. Just sit down, hold on, and go along for the ride!"
3,"Too many characters, but I've always liked his inclusiveness","I have read many of McDevitt's books. I salute him for placing humans of various races in his books who are just people, no more no less.As I deal with the insults against black women by prominent idiots in the popular culture, black and white alike, it is nice to know that there are artists out there who are giving strong roles to women of color in their stories, not to mention roles to women of character, period.I cannot say I liked this story much, however. Too many characters! Too many displays of cranks and opportunists, just like those in ""Ancient Shores."" I prefer not to have to deal with the vast displays of human stupidity in my science fiction.I prefer some of his other efforts and will continue to go back into his collection to read those I haven't gotten to as yet.I found myself skimming most of the book, but reading all of the Haskell and Evelyn scenes, along with the Saber and Lee scenes.Nevertheless, I say, keep them coming!"
5,Very good story.,"While this is NOT a book I would pack for move to remote island for remainder of my life, I did enjoy it very much. I will encourage friends to read this book and others by McDevitt."
5,collecting tinker bell memorabilia,"I purchased this item based on my experience with Madame Alexander products over the past 30 + years. I purchased it for my daughter-in-law who is quite a fanatical fan of Tink. I looked the doll over before wrapping it and found it delightful. My daughter-in-law said she felt likewise. It is such good quality. The dolls by nature are not cuddley/cuddly (?) so the essence of ""fairy-like"" is missing -- you know, the lithe and lovely and flighty and flitty characteristics we imagine belong to fairies. But then again I am not so sure about a stuffed Tink . . . ?I think this is a wonderful product. NOT a toddler doll. It is a collectible doll to be cherished and looked at with both parent/adult and child then put away again for another time."
1,Confoundedly disappointing!,"I had expected something of the genre and quality of Market Wizards I & II, Trading for a living, Trade like a Hedge Fund (by James Altucher), Soros on Soros, Reminiscences of a stock operator, Running Money by Andy Kessler etc etc. I had been confoundedly disappointed. The book is flooded of interviews with hedge fund managers anonymous leading you to nowhere but setting goals, visualizing success, overcoming fears and all the stuff you find in any trading psychology book, only that the writing skill of the author is sub-standard. The author had repeated the term ""Hedge Fund"" highly frequently. However, the content is not related particularly to any hedge fund or hedge fund manager at all. Also, the author had elaborated the term ""mastery"" throughout the book. I assure you that you will have no idea of how to achieve it unless you employ the author as your personal trading counsellor.In short, a waste of time, money and the paper to print the book."
1,Suspicious Reviews,"'Sceptic' (See March 2nd review below) is right - the author has conjured up a slew of similar 5 star reviews from family, friends and SAC office co-workers. His ego knows no bounds.If you have his first two books you would be wasting your money to get this one. And it would be nice to expect better of an author on subjects of peak performance than to pad reviews. Sorry, Ari."
1,Smaller than stated,"It says, "" Product Dimensions: 8.3 x 7 x 6.2 inches"". However, it is only 5""by 5"" which is way too small for my burner and you do not want to put a stainless steel pot on a burner that is bigger than the base of the pan or you'll ruin it/"
4,Neat Pan!,"I gave this as a gift. They say it is a very useful pan and that they use it alot. I thought it would be good because it fits on that smallest eye on the stove,which never gets hardly used."
5,cute and practical,"This little pot has plenty of potential uses, but I use it strictly for making tea. I like to boil water and steep the tea in the same pot. The straining lid keeps the tea bags from falling out when I pour, and it looks cute enough to leave on the stovetop. Keep in mind that the side handle stays cool, but the lid gets very hot."
4,earns its place in the kitchen,"I purchased this little pot from Amazon a couple of years ago and use it pretty frequently. Mostly i use it for boiling eggs, but it comes in handy for gravy and other types of sauces or it is perfect for homemade hot chocolate. Make no mistake it is LITTLE. 8 cups might be smaller than you expect, but for my family of 5 it gets the little jobs done. Some of the reviews question the quality of this product, I have been pleased with its sturdiness and durability, my only comment would be after frequent use there are several noticeable scratches on the outside of the pan. I have only hand washed it, but i'm sure it gets banged around going in and out of the cupboard and i nest it in a larger pan for space saving purposes. The scratches are not really troublesome to me, but might be a big negative for some."
3,Was this lid even made for the pot?,"I can't comment on the cooking potential of this little pot ... because I'll be returning it unused ... the pot looks great, good weight, good size, nice finish but for a pot that is supposed to trap steam when you have the holes covered I think the lid would actually have to fit the pot! This pot is at least 1/4 inch too big for the lid! the lid actually rattles around on the pot it is so small. There is no way this will contain steam. As for the straining function of the pot ... it is a two hand job since one hand will have to hold down the lid. For a pot this size I would expect the lid to be tight fitting to allow for single handed straining ... if I have to use 2 hands I was already doing that with my saucepan and strainer!I contacted Norpro and I am hoping this is a random error and they will send me a tighter fitting one but if they can't help me this one is definitely going back. Too bad since I really do like the appearance."
3,A Ok Book,"I enjoyed reading this book, when I could under stand it. The main charcter is Paul Kindom. This book is about an army [Deathsingers], trying to take over Dugoum,Nagala, but some gangs in Dugoum they try to get to get to together a big group to take and try to defeat the deathsingers [they do]. They also free Paul's so called dad Micheal Kindom. I would not recommend this book to a kid under 13 like me because there are to many names and different languges."
4,Great book to own,"I bought this book for one of my first political science classes. Awesome book to references gives great detail about how the various governmental structures in the international realm function. Some minor details that change about seats, parties, constitutions correspond with the year but other than looking up those few details. Great book for any political science major to own."
3,AP Gov Students Thoughts,"I am an 11th grader using this book in my AP Government class, and I have not been thourougly impressed with this book. It is incredibly dense and hard to follow. (It usually takes me over two hours to do a Chapters worth of notes.) The vocabulary words are rarely defined and usually lack contextual clues as well.If this book is to be used for a high school AP class, then it should come with more resources for either the teacher (so they have a thorough understanding of the book) or else for the students.From what I can tell, this book has a lot of useful information, and seems to be a decent resource if the students and teacher are willing to put the time into it. Unfortunately, with an AP test four months away, time is in short supply."
2,Not worth it.,"I found this book's literal weight significantly greater than its intellectual weight. No where in the book does it ever give ANY definitions for the vocabulary words, most of which are unique to politics; one cannot even glean a hint of a definition from context. The book was written by different authors, some of whom were worth reading, but mostly not. The chapter on England had such horrendous grammatical and spelling errors, I couldn't keep reading it (I have no idea how it is in its eighth edition). Most of the book used casual phrases for the lay person but never gets into the specifics of what I need to learn about the functioning of international politics. The book was awful. Had I not wanted to recoup some of my wasted money, I would have covered every page in red ink and sent it back to the publishers for proof reading. It was extensive, but never really got to the core of the topic."
4,Suprisingly Enjoyable Movie,"I rented this movie for a cheap thrill and a couple of chuckles, and ended up viewing a surprisingly entertaining and downright funny movie. Sort of an early American Pie, this movie follows four boys in their quest to get laid. This is where the paths of the two movies divirge, however, the boys unite under the idea of holding auditions for a phony porno flick. This is where the movie really starts to get funny. Be forewarned, however, that this movie is not really intelectual humor, but if you are a fan of Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, or any other comedians of this type, you should definately give this movie a try."
1,Very short life,"The first bulb lasted about 4 weeks with intermittent use, the second lasted less than two weeks. I strongly recommend against buying this product."
3,Faking the sun for our turtles,"It's a bulb, I can't say much. It's been working for several months now and the turtles can't seem to tell a difference between it and the pricier ones in the local stores."
2,Horrible Life Expectancy,"Bought these to heat my bearded dragon tank. The amount of heat that was produced was perfect, but 1 bulb lasted 2 months, the other lasted 2 DAYS before burning out. I will not repurchase. They're too expensive to last a total of 2 months. Next time I am purchasing regular household lightbulbs which are a fraction of the price and last much longer."
4,really really,Well this light heats my snakes cage just right. One side cool the other nice and toasty. Yup its a good thing i got this.
4,basking,Great for basking for my bearded dragons. The only issue I have is the bulbs burning out in a few months. Otherwise the product works great!
3,Works but not what I ordered,"Be very care of the pictures of the items that you order. I ordered a 100 watt bulb and was sent a 75 watt. When I called ZooMed saying I received the wrong item, they said it was Amazons fault for not changing the picture. Well..it would of been cheaper for me to drive to the store at this rate."
1,Zoo Med Basking Lamps,"The reason I am only giving a one star to my review is that the picture was deceptive. The basking lamp shown was a 100 watt and when I received my order, I was shipped 75 watt lamps. I could have probably bought the 75 watt lamps locally at a price that would have been just as good as what I paid. I think this is deceptive advertising. The lamps themselves are fine, although not what I thought I was ordering."
1,Terrible life expectancy,"I bought a two pack of these bulbs from a local retailer on 14 March. Worked great initially, but I was pretty disgusted when I came home from work on 26 March to find the lamp burned out. A week and a half? I thought perhaps the bulb overheated or something, although you'd figure a *heat lamp* would be designed to tolerate high heat. Anyway, I tilted the bowl fixture from almost straight down to about 35 degrees off of vertical to allow more heat to escape, and aimed a pretty small fan at the top of the fixture to cool it. The second bulb blew out on 8 April, giving me an average bulb life of about 12 days--but considering the bulbs were on a 10 hour timer, they lasted for about 120 hours each. Totally unacceptable! Since then I've had a regular Philips 100W reflector spot bulb and it's been working great for 61 days. An email I sent to Zoo Med has gone unanswered for weeks. I won't be buying anything from Zoo Med again."
1,Poor quality for price,I bought a 75wt bulb and it failed after two weeks. Had it on for 10hrs a day in a ceramic wire cage lamp. Will be looking for a better brand.
2,Guess it's o.k,I don't really like the finish on this product. Looks like plastic compared to other copper items in my kitchen. I'm glad I only purchased one of the set.
4,Wish they were a bit bigger,"They are nice and not cheap looking at all. They were quite small for what I pictured, good thing I ordered two. We will just have to see how long they stay nice.."
4,Nice caddy,"There is nothing really unique about this tool caddy. I was just looking for something copper to go with my new granite countertops. I'm using it for sponges, bottle cleaner, etc. It's a little small to use for other kitchen utensils, like spatulas."
4,pretty good,"Todd Rundgren's first solo album shows signs of a great songwriter with the ability to experiment. The songs for the most part are memorable, with Todd already showing signs of a musician going in a direction that would put him on the map forever. His dated-sounding ballads are included (sorry, but they DO sound stuck in the 70's) and his weirder moments (in other words, his BEST stuff) has been included as well. Good start."
4,Rundt,"Not all of this works, and what does tends to be marred by tinny production- -the drums sound particularly wan on the tracks recorded in Los Angeles- -but it's a serviceable first-time solo outing for the Runted One. Todd was never God, or Godd, or even Gawd, but he was and is a great songwriter. Talk about eclectic- -this has its roots not merely in Nazz but in such far-flung influences as progressive rock (slight but noticeable) to Gilbert & Sullivan and 60's Brill Building (very noticeable) to Laura Nyro (virtually everywhere). Ms. Nyro even gets a back-handed name-dropping in 'Baby Let's Swing', though given Todd's predilection with evil humor it's hard to tell whether he's paying adulatory tribute or expressing disgusted exasperation at her genius. Probably both. The brief 'There Are No Words' says it all- -sometimes there aren't, and sometimes it's better that way."
2,THE Worst Dino cd I EVER Bought !,"I bought this at a Sam Goody at the mall and I was appalled that they would release [material] like this. The sound quality is attrocious (I have RECORDS with better sound) The song selection was poor and it was sloppily put together. The artwork is not any better than the sound either. I listened to it and most of the tracks you can find much better versions of elsewhere. I am a huge Dean Martin fan but the only semblance this had to the Dino I love is the name. Most of the time it doesn't even sound like him. It's not the worst cd i ever bought but but the worst cd i've bought with Dean Martin's name on the cover. There's a reason it's cheap. I gave it two stars because it could have been worse but not by much. Also anything with Dino's name on it deserves at least two stars, no matter how bad."
3,FLY IN THE OINTMENT,"Thanks to my parents and their peers, I was exposed to Dean Martin at an early age. As talent as the man is, I truly hate the title song, ""Everybody Loves Somebody."" Ever since I was barely out of the carriage, I would have to leave whenever I heard it because I truly cannot stand that song. I would rather hear the 5:00 train whistle and construction equipment. I truly hate that one song. That being the one exception, the rest of the collection remains easy listening music and a meeting grounds of the generations. (I'd still rather listen to Crosby, Stills & Nash)."
3,I HATE THE TITLE SONG,"This music was the music that my parents and their peers loved. As a result, I became familiar with Dean Martin's music as a young child (I preferred the Beatles and the DC5). He had a nice voice and I enjoyed most of his tunes, but since I was a very little girl, barely out of the carriage I have truly detested ""Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime."" I JUST CAN'T ABIDE THAT SONG! I TRULY HATE IT! That one fly in the ointment notwithstanding, this is a decent collection."
4,good tube,What can I say? It's a tube. It holds air. The box says Inline but the tube is labeled Kenda.
2,Oops!,"I did buy this single CD and the songs are great, but for some reason I didn't realize that it was a single! I feel like such a dork for not reading all the way through. I wanted to give this as a gift to my sister, and all I knew was that she really liked Michael Buble, so I just randomly picked a CD that I knew she didn't have. Whoops. When I got the CD I realized that I had just shelled out $13 for a SINGLE. Can we say WAY overpriced? I gave it to her anyway, and she put the songs in her iPod with the others and she was happy. But I still feel foolish for not reading the description all the way."
2,Not feeling good,"I bought this single without thinking that this is not just the one song, but two others were added that I did not read product detail carefully. My fault, but I could have bought a lot more for the money than and still got the same length of time in the song. I just thought that It would be a longer version like some I ordered. It is not and had two other songs that I don't particularly like out of all of Michael Buble songs. I love Buble, but the CD is a rip off."
2,Not quite there,"I was excited to get this CD. I'd listened to The Gift and thought his music was very relaxing. The first sign that this CD wasn't going to be as good as the others was the disclaimer on the back that stated that this ""collection"" was ""specially created by Jim and features all new versions of classics."" If I had read this I would have known to stay away.Messages like this can be translated to mean the following: ""This CD has limited new material and it was put together by recyling past-not-quite-hits so that the artist can meet his contract requirement of at least one CD per year.""Perhaps the true, die-hard, Brickman fan would appreciate this half-hearted effort, but b/c the songs weren't very good to begin with, new versions of them don't make them any better. I wouldn't recommend this to a new fan. Start with the Gift and stay away from the ""collections."""
4,Jim's Re-Issued 'Valentine' CD ...,"This is an almost entirely different release than his original 'Valentine' CD (also with a different cover: issued with him standing against a completely red background). Although many of the songs have been included in other collections up through this point, there are a few first-timers. One is the non-vocal version of the title track: Valentine. An overall very enjoyable disc."
4,A good bet for Bruckner fans,"As a Bruckner fan, I have been interested in hearing this for a long time, so I bought it without ever hearing a note. I have been rewarded. For Bruckner fans, this is a fine addition to your collection and should not disappoint. He uses similar effects in this chamber piece as he would in his symphonies,his characteristic tremolos and crescendos, etc.I chose this over the other offerings of the Bruckner String Quintet, because Harmonia Mundi tends to put good recordings out on the market. They have a fine list of recordings and are often a reliable source."
3,One Good and One Bad,"I ordered 2 of these batteries, one works great and the other does not hold a charge. Even though these were being sold elsewhere for less, I ordered them from Amazon in case I had a problem. I'm glad I did because Amazon made the return effortless and fully credited me for the dud battery (including free return shipping since it was a problem with the product). Thanks Amazon."
1,Panasonic CGR-H703 Lithium Ion Battery,I have ordered 3 similar batteries for my LS90 Panasonic DVD player. The first one worked perfectly. The other 2 could not be charged and had to be returned. I suspect that the batteries were from an old stock and had past their viable state.
3,Do not buy if...,You're thinking you're going to get the same tone of as John 5.Because I naively (another word for ignorant or stupidly) bought it because I thought was going to get JOhn 5's guitar tone from that one youtube video I saw advertising this particular pedal.If you're looking for a pedal that raises the volume and overall bright tone I say give it a shot and see how you like it.If you're looking for heavy crunchy distortion...than THIS IS NOT THE PEDAL FOR THAT.The distortion on this pedal is ridiculously bleak...and absent.It does give you that much range on distortion either.but it does give you an acceptable range for making those solos stand out.So like I said... i'd give it a try and see how you like it...and maybe even write a review too...to save other people time like I just did for you.
1,Worst Knife I've never used,"I bought this knife and tried many configurations to be able to use it and I hate it. They have this funky strap arrangement that was no fun at all and it has what they claim is a quick clip it's not quick at all.I tried to use the BC mounting attachment instead. The holes are too small for the screw and are crooked.The blade is in a handle that allows you to take it apart for cleaning, nice feature but the blade is loose in the handle and feels like it will fall out.It does not feel solid at all and I don't feel comfortable having to rely on this product. I would have returned it but I live overseas so it would cost too much to send back.I've been diving over 30 years and have tried lots of gear, a knife is a simple item and this one well lets say it's not coming diving any time soon. I've given up and tossed it in the tool box maybe it will be good to pry open a can of paint."
4,Useful,"I bought several of the John Brown DVD's. Some do look like transfers from VHS. Some have chapters, some are 1 long chapter. They run about 20-40 minutes. They cover strategies and mechanics briefly, then focus on exercises that build the desired muscles/skill, punching/footwork drills, then sparring drills w/ partner. They also show lots of cool gear for training, most of it from Ringside, of course.Overall, they're not super in depth, but you WILL learn some things. I think it's worth the money if you're interested in the specific topic (though I wouldn't buy all 21!)."
5,A must have for those conducting surveys!,I've been doing online surveys and consulting for years and have found Vista surveys to be the best by far. This book really helps to enusure that I ask the right questions for my Fortune 500 clients! Highly recommend indeed!
3,Good research methods,I used this book for class. It is a good reference book which thoroughly explores research methods. It is exactly as I would expect a classroom text to be.
5,Didn't receive the book,I ordered three books and this is the only one I didn't receive. At first I thought the hurricane might have slowed the process up but I never did get it. I had to drop my class.
1,He can't even get his facts straight,"Case Study #2 involves [...] aka Harvard Coop.Students who become ""members"" of the coop own the place..how is the Coop supposed to then make a profit?Yet para2 line6 asks exactly this!What kind of escapeees-from-business-reality do wehave out there writing our business textbooks?"
1,Good extension cord... does not protect from surges,"A lightning storm fried my Xbox and my Denon AVR 2802 receiver that were plugged into this surge protector. I also had a 55"" Mitsubishi TV, a DVD player, and a subwoofer on the same surge protector that were fine (maybe it protected somewhat?).After dealing with Thomson's reps. for 2 months now (they own Acoustic Research), they said that nothing is wrong with the surge protector and they are denying the claim. So if nothing is wrong with this product, then it apparently does not block surges as it advertises.This makes an excellent 7 outlet extension cord, but I wouldn't plug anything more valuable than a lamp into it."
5,Norpro Krona steamer/cooker set 8 quarts,"I have owned a set of Norpro Krona pots and pans for over seven years, getting heavy use each day. When I saw that there was now a 4-piece Steamer/Cooker Set, I immediately ordered one. The arrangement of steamer basket suspended by its rim over a pasta colander makes it ideal for steaming vegetables while simultaneously boiling pasta. The vegetables can be lifted out of the pot at any time by the folding wire handles on the steamer basket, allowing you to control their tenderness.I am unhappy with the new glass-and-steel lids that Norpro has begun using because they are not seamless nor as well-made as the older, solid-steel lids. Other than that, the Steamer/Cooker Set has performed exactly as expected and as always, with an entirely stainless steel construction, has been easy to clean either by hand or in the dishwasher. And yes, the triple-layer construction on the bottom of the pan diffuses the heat from my gas burners very effectively."
1,This has to be a joke!,"This is a hideous display of human idiocy - there is no way that any thinking, reasoning adult could actually hold these views. This simply must have been written as some kind of sick joke - not funny at all."
4,Disc 1 Provides New Content ; Disc 2 Fails to Do So,"I wish Underworld had simply released only the 1st disc, and charged less for the set. Disc 1 is great, as it offers several rare tracks; Big Mouth, Dirty, mmm Skyscraper I Love You, & Spikee. These songs are all great, and make the CD worth purchasing... or at least purchasing used. Disc 2, however, is less exciting. It contains 9 tracks, 4 of which are either identical or slightly modified copies of songs from Beaucoup Fish. CD 2 is basically filled with slight variations on songs that are already in any Underworld fan's collection. I wish that instead of re-releasing a bunch of songs that people already have, Underworld had released more rare material. If anything, I think that the original songs are better than the remixes. In general, the originals tend to have longer and more complex lyrics."
3,its not bad,got it fast and from vender and install was not the top of the line speaker but sounded fine and suited its purpose. I've already speaker up.
1,DONT BUY THIS CRAP!!!,"This sub is the biggest hunk of CRAP ive ever owned. Yea, its loud, it hits good but the emblem in the middle will pop off, and your sub will INSTANTLY crack, and blow. I had THREE of them, now im going to Kicker L7s, a sub that will NOT do anything like this hunk of garbage does."
2,maybe good for the home but not the car,its not that bad but not for the car it would be good for house audio not car audio it don't have low bass and it don't hit that hard.
2,Not worth the price,I was kind of surprised when I opened this CD rack from its packaging. It is not finished. You will have to paint or finish the CD rack to use and also assemble it. I guess I didn't do enough research before purchasing! But it was not worth the price ultimately.
5,The good ol' days,"Finally there's a book that captures the spirit of those great SF 49ers teams. As a lifelong fan of the 49ers (yes, I saw them play in Kezar), this book will help me get through what might be a rough season. I loved Roger Craig as a player and I find him to be an excellent storyteller."
5,Great Book by a Great Player and a Great Person!,"I had the opportunity to meet Roger Craig at a charity basketball game last fall and he seemed like a great guy. Being a lifelong 49er's fan, I was thrilled to find out that one of my favorite players of all time had a book coming out. It's a nice, light, and insightful read that can be done in one sitting but the stories and lessons that ""Catfish"" provides will stay with you for a long time.A definite must for any fan of the ""Team of the 80's"" and also an interesting read for any NFL fan. Thanks for all of the great memories Roger!"
5,THIS BOOK ABOUT THE 49ERS STRUCK GOLD,ROGER CRAIG DOES A GREAT JOB DISCUSSING THE 49ERS FROM THE LATE 1970'S THRU HIS CAREEER THAT ENDED IN THE EARLY 90'S. HE BROUGHT BACK SOME GREAT MEMORIES AND HIGHLIGHTS OF HIS CAREER AND OF THE SUPER BOWL SEASONS. I ALWAYS LOVED WATCHING HIM PLAY AND FELT HE WAS NOT GIVEN ENOUGH CREDIT. THE NINERS WERE ONE OF THE ELITE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND HIS BOOK BRINGS IT ALL BACK WITH AN EASY TO READ AND EXCELLENT RETELLING OF THOSE FABULOUS TEAMS. I READ THIS IN 2 DAYS COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. THIS IS FOR ALL NINER FANS. WELL WORTH IT.
3,Not as bad as all that,"I too got this for my son for Christmas. I had it as a child. There are ""issues"", but can be worked around. Don't use the guides behind the plate and the bat swings freely. Don't use the pitching guide given, instead use one of the plastic guides meant to go behind the plate and you'll pitch a strike every time. Make sure to use the little round magnet ball to pitch and hit and the larger magnet to ""throw"". The little ball is an improvement over the older model I grew up with. Yea, the scoreboard and throwing arm are kinda flimsy, but again, can be modified to work better. Overall, something that will get your kid playing something besides EA's Major League Baseball on his X-box, and is enjoyable if you work with it."
4,A little different from moog/way but good,"This cd is a little different than the moog way cd's or ufo it still rocks but the guitar playing is leaning towards a little more towards jazz/fusion/blues than even more than the moog way cd's. My favorites on it are Overlord, Clap Hands..the songs takes off after a while..despite what you hear on the samples page, bad on bad, beautiful friend, and falling down. All songs are good and the cd does end up being a little different from the samples they of it at tracks."
2,not the same all the time,"I had purchased this same item from a department store years earlier and was very very satisfied with it. Finally, after years of use and abuse, it broke and I was very pleased to find it's replacement online. However, it turned out to be the evil twin. My main complaint is that it does not remain stationary with your ironing board. There is a large plastic screw which threads through the metal base and should clamp tightly against the underside of your ironing board. However, the plastic screw constantly comes out of the metal base and so the whole holder wobbles while in use. Also keep in mind that it folds from right to left for storage and so needs to be mounted on the left side of the ironing board. This is a little awkward for righties as we would stand on the left side of ironing board while ironing."
1,Find it elsewhere !!,"I ordered the item and I guess it was on back order, but no one let me know. So I waited and waited finally I sent them an email and was informed of the status. Took forever to receive the item I would never buy from them again !!"
5,A Different Use,"I purchased the Iron Cord Holder to keep my oxygen tube up out of the way while I'm working. I needed something sturdy, yet flexible to sway or bend when I walked away from my desk, but also one that would fold down out of the way when I had a visitor. It's everything I needed!!!! It's not often you can find something under ten bucks that fits every need.Judith Woodard"
3,"not the best film, but the special effects are mindblowing!","This movie has a good but not great plot element to it. The acting was also not the best, but the special effects for the tunnel explosion are some of the most incredible I have ever seen!I didn't really like this movie ia a favorie but I bought the DVD - just for the explosion scene alone. I watch it frame by frame on my dvd player.The filmmakers even said that they wanted the fire to have a plasma like look to it and they did a really good job at it! In my opinion, the special effects in that scene are one of the best pyrotechnics displays in cinematic history!"
4,another good Stallone movie,"I don't know of any Sylvester Stallone movies that I don't like and this one is certainly no exception. I remember the critics were all over this movie because it wasn't as good as everybody was expecting it to be and then they gave it bad or mediocre reviews.When I finally saw it, I realized that it's not action packed like most of Stallone's previous movies, but it's still not a bad movie. The special effects are good and the movie will keep you interested throughout because you wonder how Stallone is going to rescue everybody from the tunnel when it seems impossible to get out.If you want an action packed movie don't get this one, but if you like entertaining action movies that have some mystery to them, then this would be a great movie to buy."
2,ONE OF THE WORST,I HAVE A 155CM TV SET AND WITH THE MOVIE BEING IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT THE BLACK BARS ON TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN MADE SAME DULL & BORNING LIKE BEING IN THE BACK ROW AT MUSIC CONCERT. THE DTS SOUND WAS GREAT BUT WAS LET DOWN BY THE HISSING WHEN TALKING.
3,"Great action fiim, keeps you on edge","If you don't have DTS get it for this film. The sound detail is incredible, a must have if you like action. Use this for your reference disc to show off your system."
5,Tunnels scare me now!,"whenever I watch this movie I wonder what are the possibilities of something bad happening whenever I go through a tunnel. You never know what could happen in a tunnel such as cars smashing into a wall, an explosion, falling water, or car accidents. this movie really made me think of the incidents that could happen in tunnels. This movie focuse on a bombing of the Holland tunnel in New York. Only over ten people survived the explosion and must find a way out of the tunnel. A person that helps them isMr. Latura(Sylvester Stallon)who is a former Emergency Medical Services cheif. The characters really face dangers in the movie such as toxic fumes, fires, falling water, and collapes of the tunnel! You will really like this movie because it is suspensful and emotional! Imagine being trapped in a tunnel all night long and you can't go home until you see daylight!"
2,I swear I've seen this somewhere before...,"If ever there was a predictable and formulatic movie, its this one. Well, this one and tons of other movies just like it, otherwise it WOULDN'T have been predictable. You knew everyone who was going to die, and once again you have people taking more risks to save a stupid dog. It seems to be against the rules these days to let a dog die in the movies. I'm not against dogs or anything, It just seems like a stupid PC stunt to me. Now look, I've gotten off track. Let's see I was talking about a movie...what was it?...I've forgotten already."
4,Great Stallone Movie,"I bought this movie because I thought that the HD would be a lot better than the regular DVD. Like many other HD and blu-ray movies I've seen, most of the scenes are not that much sharper than the regular DVD but the color and sound are better so I can't complain too much. I am also running these on a Sony 40"" LCD which may have some to do with that."
3,Awesome Sound!,"This was the first DTS DVD I ever got. My favorite part is the 30-second DTS intro: awesome sound. The movie itself is not as satisfying. At 1 hour 55 minutes, it feels too long. The ""diverse band of survivors"" is, in my opinion, too diverse: it has everyone from the stuffy aristocrats to the juvenile punks in the tunnel at the same time, and none of them can be sympathized with. The cinematography is decent, but the music -- well, let's just say that not every movie can have a great score. It's tedious and repetitive -- hard to tell when it's supposed to be sad, suspenseful, or inspirational. Overall, a ** movie at best, worth *** because of the DTS."
4,Stallone fan - action packed,Well made action movie - everyone gives good performance. I have been throught that tunnel in the past - don't want to go again aftre this movie=HA!!
3,Movie for 25 cents?,This movie was sold for .25 + Shipping cost. It was my fault entirely for not seeing that it was a HD movie- or DVD wouldn't play it at all.
5,TUNNEL OF THRILLER,I CHOSE THE RATING BECUZ I LIKE THE CAST AND SUCH A GREAT MOVIE SO YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT IS THERE A WAY TO SURVIVE AN DISASTER AND HELPING OTHERS. I LIKE SYLVESTER STALLONE MOVIES DUE TO HIS TALENT MAKES ME WANT TO WATCH HIS MOVIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO STALLONE FANS
3,Another action-disaster movie.,"It is diverting enough, but I wouldn't watch it a second time. It is one of many films that were designed to show case Stallone in a hero role."
4,GIVE ME AIR!,In this movie we begin with several looks at different people going through there daily lives. Gradually they all converge on a tunnel in New York city that goes under the river to get to the other side. At the same time a runaway car is flying through the tunnel to get away from the police(some punks pulled off a robbery). Unknowingly they crash into a convoy of trucks carrying toxic flammable material. The resulting firey explosion is by far one of the best Ive ever seen. Our heros are trapped in the tunnel in which most people died. Stallone is an ex-rescue chief who goes in against all odds to lead them out. The battle of these people is almost overwelming but they forge on in all sorts of bad conditions. At places there is some fine acting as the group bonds with each other and things are revealed about them that takes the viewer by surprize. I wont spoil the ending but it too is pretty good although unbeliveable. Even so I recommened this movie.
3,I enjoyed it.,"Yes, if you've seen one disaster movie, you've seen them all! I'm not even a Sylvester Stallone fan. I did, however, like this movie. Even though it is predictable, it was action packed. There was also the human compassion element that we can never see too much of. Maybe that's why there are so many disaster movies--to remind us of the compassion we can display in times of trouble. Overall, I recommend this movie."
3,"Beautiful book, but...","The author started with a great idea of finding inspiration in old paintings. The jewels are far from being perfect copies but their imperfection gives them an appealing style.However, since this is a how-to book, it should at least introduce the polymer clay to the beginners. The author reduced the subject into a single paragraph. You have to guess where to obtain most of the material; don't look for a list of suppliers, there is none. This ""je m'en fous"" attitude may work for the French but the English-speaking reader expects a more thorough approach to details."
3,"Good for inspiration, but lacking in honor","As a beginning jeweler who has worked with polymer clay in the past, I was quite excited to read this book. Though it inspired me to create some new pieces, I found the projects offered to be a complete disgrace to the original artists."
3,Kindle download is not DBW edition,"I think the graphics for the Kindle edition are a little misleading. The Kindle download for 'Ethics' is the older edition, not the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works edition."
5,What would you do when you cannot do what Jesus would do?,"Based upon choices the author had to make in early twentieth century central Europe, we soon realize that ethics is much more interesting and complex in real life than it is in the classroom or study group. It is the essence of ""how ought one to live"" without the contrived scenario that is often presented there. He had to answer real questions from the soul, such as ""Would it be wrong to murder the devil, if you could do so and it would save many others"" (not a direct quote from the book, but along the same line).Good reading and definitely character-building."
4,"Pretty Good... More of a Drama movie, than ""christmas"" feel","I bought this movie without seeing it. I love love LOVED Megan Follows in it! She is a FANTASTIC actress! I wished she was in more of the movie. This felt like more of a ""drama"" movie, than the typical ""christmas"" feel... (so, it depends what you are looking for). It was mostly about a man (who was adopted as a child), trying to find out more about his past. The story was a bit dry at times, but I think what made the movie was the supporting actors/actresses. There are some great characters that make it nice. I haven't decided if I'm going to keep it yet, as it was ""pretty good"", but not fantastic. .....(I also bought ""Christmas Shoes"" movie at the same time, and I thought that was better, it's a keeper... you might want to check that out as well!) :-)Overall, it was pretty good, I guess. Megan Follows get an A++++!! :-)"
3,duck the ending,"This movie does a good job of developing three story threads for 88 minutes: a marriage that has died emotionally, a small-town sheriff to rival the one in Rambo (""First Blood""), and a man searching for his birth parents. Then, the movie falls to pieces. In two minutes the filmmaker tacks ad hoc endings onto all three story threads. As if that weren't enough, you also get treated to two quickie sermons. Be forewarned. Even religionists like to see problems solved, not have them vanish for no reason except that the filmmaker ran out of time (or out of ideas).As to acting, Megan Follows is the only one here who knows how to act. The others walk through their parts like stand-ins.And, oh yes, you get treated to rock-country versions of the Christmas carols.Too bad. This could have been a good movie."
3,Christmas Child Worth Your While,"This was a good movie. Not anything sectacular but if you set aside the low budget and the ocasional questionable acting it has a good story line and makes for a very entertainig Christmas movie. It is one of those movies you can sit down with the whole family and everyone enjoy. If you are a big movie buff this may not be one to add to your collection. however if you are looking for something that is entertaining, has a good storyline, decent acting and something you will leave with, I would reccomend this movie."
3,GOOD INTENTIONS--SO-SO MOVIE,"Based on a story by popular Christian author Max Lucado, CHRISTMAS CHILD is loaded with good intentions. However, it's overly leisurely pacing and a weak performance by lead William R. Moses prevent the film from having a truly emotional impact. The story follows journalist and workaholic Moses as he takes a Christmas assignment in Dallas, only to end up in Clearwater, the town where his real parents came from. (He's adopted and wants to know his past). There he meets some friendly folk, and not so friendly (Sheriff Muse Watson in an understated performance), and tries to uncover his roots. This shell of a plot affords us a chance to explore the meaning of the season, and we also get a chance to see Steven Curtis Chapman (Christian music superstar) in a fitting role as the local minister, and also the father of an adopted child (parallels Chapman's real life adoption of three little girls). It's all a little predictable, but one can't deny it's good intentions."
4,Great clean Christmas film,"I thought this was a wonderful feel-good Christmas movie that focuses on redemption, forgiveness, and the true meaning of Christmas. Although the acting was not spectacular, the movie as a whole was very moving. I liked Steven Curtis Chapman (one of my favorite artists) as Pastor Curtis, especially when he spoke about his (real-life) passion for adoption.I think this is a great film - once again Max Lucado has written a fabulous story!"
3,'Adoption' Story or Christmas Story?,"I thought the movie was 'ok'. It's not really a Christmas movie, as much the all-to-familiar story of adopted child looking for birthparents (and the secretness of a small town) set against the backdrop of Christmas. For some reason the actors left me cold... and I couldn't emotionally connect with the film (it paled in comparison with say a movie like ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Watching it once was ok, but I would never want to see it again, or buy the dvd."
2,Not very Christmassy,"I found myself wanting Megan Follows (who played Anne Shirley inAnne of Green Gables) to have more screen time. Her position as the wife who wants to keep working at the marriage seemed more powerful than the protagonist, who didn't appeal to me. He didn't get angry when he should, he didn't feel sad when he should. In short, very little emotions from this fellow, for whom the whole movie is about his discovery of things he has been wondering all his life.The storyline with the sheriff is interesting, but they never redeem him by letting us know why he did what he did. I thought he was just following orders from someone higher up, but the movie didn't even pick up on that part. Even the idea that he is born on Christmas Eve, didn't seem to produce any kind of special story for the character.I was hoping to get my Chrismassy warm feeling from watching this movie, but instead, I just felt slightly disappointed."
3,Not what I expected,"Though an okay movie, I was dissappointed by the music. I have this thing about good music and much of what passes for Contemporary Christian is just rock with different words. This was no exception in that. I watched it twice and that is probably all I will watch it. I think I will donate it to the library."
4,a surrender to the moon,"I ordered this as an extra copy for a gift and the first page poem was different that the one that I have. The first poem "" ABlazing Path"" was the poem that I wanted the book for. But instead I received a copy with "" whispers reign"" as the first poem, how did this happen? and does anyone have the copy that I am looking for?"
5,How does it do that?,"This product is amazing. I have a lot of fine hair that will gently curl on its own (and then frizz) but with a bit of a blow dry is straight. However, my hair is VERY frizz prone. I have never been able to achieve soft curls without tons of frizz. Somehow this product makes my hair curlier than it would be naturally but without the frizz. I have never used anything similar. The instructions on the product are bizarre and initially I thought it was a joke (twirling hair around your finger...) but it really works, and you can control the size of the curl based on the amount you twirl. It's quite amazing."
1,BB disappoints,"Based on all of the positive reviews here, I thought this product would be great for my naturally wavy hair. Unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing. No hold. No curl boost. No shine. No nothing. I really wanted to like this product, trying several different ways of styling with it, from letting it air dry to finger curling and diffusing. But I got nothing but a frizzy, dull, definitionless mop of hair from this product. It probably works well for people with super curly hair, but if your hair is wavy, go ahead and pass on this overpriced bottle of blah. I'll be returning the product to BB."
3,Who wrote this?,"While some of the information is good, this book sounds like it went through a couple of interpreters before it got to press."
1,infini de Caron,The box was openned. It smells like smoke.. I had to throw the bottle. This is not what I expected. I know now not to order perfum on line. It could have been tempered I do not know. Was unable to return it.
5,Lori's Miracle: Inspirational Tale,"As a busy mother of two young children, and at present 9 months pregnant, I seldom have the time or energy to read novels. After hearing about this book, I decided to make time. I am so glad that I did! Once I opened the book, I could not put it down. The story is about Lori, the baby who can only be described as ""God's baby"" as John refers to her. She had multiple odds against her, yet miraculously through her many painful surgeries and obstacles continues to shine her bright smile at the world. John's insight into his family's journey is both heartwrenching and inspirational. He describes a world of uncertainty about his daughters survival, describing treatments and medical interventions that are the things of parents nightmares, yet all the while he does so with dignity and strength. I have great admiration for Johns talent as an author and a parent. Thank you for sharing your story, I wish your family well."
4,Gem from an under-appreciated band,"Most people I talk to have never heard of Horslips, a strangely-named Irish band from the 1970's. That's a shame. Yet there's still hope, since celtic rock is undergoing a re-discovery and this band had the concept clearly developed two decades ago. This album includes original material with a strong rock sound overlaying some folky stuff - mainly fiddles, penny whistles, and other traditional instruments. The tunes are catchy to the point of addiction, particularly the title track, and ""Green Star Liner"", which will tend to hum along in your head for hours. The band has a fairly big, textured, mature sound in this album, which is much less folky and traditional than some of their earlier work. For those who like Celtic rock, Horslips is definitely worth a listen."
5,One of their best,"This album seemed to have ruffled the feathers of the Celtic folk purists, if there is indeed such a creature, when it was released. Yes, it's louder and veers more towards rock territory, but the Celtic roots are still there if you listen carefully. And frankly, these are just great, powerful songs, whatever genre you want to file them under, some of the strongest material that the band ever wrote. Over 30 years later, this album still packs a punch."
1,Where's the Brazilian music?,"As a big fan of this series, my expectations may have been too high. This is the worst of the series. It lacks the Brazilian influence. This release is ""stretching the soup"", so to speak."
4,"good movie, good feelings...","Although this move reminds of another movie involving a character who is unwillingly outcast by the outside world becuase of unearthly powers (the movie would be Powder), It has more of closeness and heart. Besides allowing us to think about the potential we all have, it also reveals how cruel we can be to those who are different. The movie showed us honesty, our fears, our reflection of Life and the relationship potential."
4,Phenomenal!,"""Phenomenon"" has to be John Travolta's best role ever! His role as ""George"" almost seems to nice to rate this a 5-star movie. However, the role was played like it should have been. To me, the movie is all about relationships we have with each other and how we effect others through those relationships. The movie has you speculating why he now has a ""special gift"" as evidenced on the assumptions of the townsfolks. He's betrayed often in the name of fear and ignorance. Yet, he never gives up his friendship. The emotional swings that fly through the movie seem very genuine in the characters. I felt that the casting was excellent and highly recommend this movie to everyone. It's one I'm glad to have as part of my DVD Collection!"
5,Loved it.,"This movie is absolutely amazing. If you haven't seen it, then you have to. It's really touching. Sad. 5/5. ."
5,Great Movie,We love this movie. We had tried to rent it but no one carried it so decided to just buy it online. It was perfect.
3,.,"Alright, listen. John Travolta was cool in Pulp Fiction because he was a sort of campy, out-of-context, but very well-used surprise. But the ""comeback"" of Travolta since then is just silly. Like Tom Hanks, he's now just a big, money-drawing name being cast in roles that would've been far better suited to other actors. Phenomenon is a good example of a silly ""that never should've been Travolta"" flick. I'll admit that, this considered, he doesn't do all THAT bad a job with the role, but the movie suffers from its obligatory Hollywood trappings, some poorly used music, and a lukewarm, familiar premise. Not as bad of a movie as I would've expected, but not great either. Get over Travolta -- he worked in PF, but now he's just gumpy, over-used, and over-praised."
5,Great movie & fast transaction!,"I ordered the movie for a school project and they arrived in perfect condition with just enough time for me to do a movie psychology review on it. I got an A, so it was worth it!"
3,A Speeding Thud,"It was exciting to see John Travolta acting so well again in a small-town setting.As far as the story went, I felt the wind-up was strong, but the actual throw went limp, landing short of the target. Somewhere in the middle of the story I felt the tampering of several hands, giving other parties more film time. Perhaps there were too many actors to fully satisfy here. Someone lost the nerve to go with the gut feeling and deliver a guy who could make serious changes and handle his super-powers. It was as if a Republican hand stepped in and decided ""they couldn't afford it."" Travolta's character could have been better than ""Charly"" here and copped out. Rewrite the last third of the movie and you could get this off the ground where it lies."
2,Oh Please,"I am amazed at the way people throw around 5-star reviews on this site. If Phenomenon is the best movie you've ever seen, then you haven't seen enough movies.This is the story of a guy that gets hit by some sort of ball of alien light, which gives him clarity of mind and memory, telekinetic powers and limitless energy. Meanwhile, everyone else in the movie has an IQ of about 50 or below -- from his auto-mechanic friends to the town doctor to the federal government goons that take him into custody.If you want to watch an unintentional comedy, here's your movie."
5,Very Good,"I think this is a very well plot for the movie. It is very creative, and that's what i love to see in a movie. Also, I love John Travolta. He is a very good actor. This movie actually made me cry. It is very good."
2,Movie is GREAT....Blu Ray is okay....,"This review will be short and to the point. If you are a studio and you have a wonderful movie like ""Phenomenon"" in your catalog, why not release it with some EXTRAS!!!??? There are ZERO extras on this disc. It is a BLU RAY. It can hold tons of information. How about releasing Thomas Newman's SCORE on CD? The only CD available is the Soundtrack of the songs during the film and ONE of Newman's songs. The soundtrack is worthless. I love this film, but I am not happy with a blu ray release that is only there to take more money out of my pocket while giving me the same thing I had on the DVD which is JUST the movie."
3,Why would Touchstone cut out scenes on the DVD release?,"I loved the movie when it came out, and would rate the video or original release 4-5. It is a touching story of an average person demonstrating that we all have the potential to be more than we ever imagined. I was disappointed that the DVD cut out several scenes, like Kyra Sedgwick's character going to the local bar looking for John Travolta's character after he disappeared. Another small scene of collecting flowers with Kyra's character children.I would have liked to have seen more extras, like a mention of how the writer developed the storyline. What books or other videos on the subject influenced this movie.It rates a 3 because on DVD where you can do so much more, taking out scenes seems like a waste."
5,Phenomenon,"Probably Travolta's best and rates with his Boeing 707. For those who like a bit of psychic phenomena, and possibly a little insight into what might be possible if we wish to believe the unbelievable, this is a terrific movie. It shows the real John Travolta. Someone without a heart could not make this movie. Apart from revealing what we might witness under certain circumstances, it also reveals thelack of depth of the average human intellect, and why education should be the most important aspect of every government's budget. Even if you just watch it and appreciate a well made movie, good acting, good cinematography, good location selection, and everything that makes a great movie, enjoy. If you're looking for more.., you might find it in this movie, and you'll enjoy it even more."
5,Good service,My mistake as I though that this was a CD. But was VHS. Its ok. It was a good quality product andyway and my mistake. Good person to do business.
3,Really inteligent,This was romantic and funny with drama in it to. And it dosent have a lot of kissing so that means younger kids can watch it to. Not like todlers or 3 or 4 year olds because it dose have some swearing in it. But other then that this movie is really inteligent and the person who wrote this knows what they where doing. I want to bye this movie know.
5,Truly helpful reference,"Came across this book on a wikipedia ref list. I'd seen discussion and accepted the importance of ""commitment"" in religion that it is central to religious language, but this book made me consider (for the first time) that ""discernment"" is another central component to religious language. Naturally, as a Christian, I had already experienced these things, but for whatever reason this book helped me link the experience with the word. I know that I am solid footing with the religious experience (God and his kid have some very good instructors), but, for me, I need a little bit of extra help with the vocabulary and this book finally did the trick especially with the word ""discernment."""
5,Lots of fun!,Lots of fun for a wide age range and excellent quality for the money. We hooked this sturdy trailer to the back of the heavy duty wagon. The kids then tied the whole thing to the back of a Barbie Jeep and and it pulled three of them around the yard in a makeshift train. This toy leaves a good deal of imagination up to the child as any good toy should. I wish that it was made to attach on the back of their tricycle. It would also be nice if it came with the heavy duty tires like the wagon.
5,Great set of extra wheels for a great price,"I have 3 boys ages 5, 3 and 1 and it is a little difficult to squeeze them in just the wagon. So I was excited when I found this product at Amazon and for such a decent price. I think when I was searching this, I recall other places wanting $60 and more. Then I found it at Amazon and I was thrilled. Plus the website offered the first time buyer deal of $30 off first purchase credited to your statement, when signing up for their credit card. I also think at the time the offer was free shipping for orders over $25. I made out really well. It is also easy to assemble and comes in handy when I have to take my small children and my sister's kids to preschool. I pile them in the wagons and away we go. My youngest son loves the trailer and thinks he is so cool sitting in there. Love this product. Thanks"
4,Ahmad Brand Earl Grey Loose Tea,"This is an excellent brand of Earl Grey tea. However, I used to be able to buy one-pound tins of the same tea from another vendor, who is no longer listed, and I would like that option again. I hope this vendor will offer one-pound tins as well."
3,The classic break-in,"Ever wonder what you would do if someone broke into your house? Would you do as the intruders asked? Or would you take matters into your own hands?This is a fairly good book. It is laid out well and there is some logic behind the events that take place. It gives a good idea about what the people are thinking about on either side of the stick.While the beginning of the book is slow and dull, by the middle of the book you are addicted. Taking you from the easy life to the main action of the book. There is a lot of things that seem out of place at the time of reading it. It all comes together towards the end to make the book complete."
4,A very interesting book to read!,"I just finished this book and I'm really impressed on how the plot of the story turns. Just imagine that instead of feeling safe in the panic room, Meg and her daughter felt horror and fear altogether. It's a really good book and I can't wait to see the movie. I hope all novels are like this exciting and interesting at the same time."
4,Page Turner,Panic Room is a true page turner. I started and finished the book in one day. A good read!
5,Panic Room,"I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. I loved all the action that was packed into it. I heard of the movie and wanted to read the book before it came to the theaters. I recomend that any one who likes action thrillers to read this book. it's short, but it's a really great book."
2,Boring,"If you dislike ""The Key"" then you won't like this one either. I find both films to be the least likeable films of Tinto Brass, who is otherwise a great director of Erotica. 2 stars for the leading lady... but that's it."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing is the word on this apparently censored version of Tinto Brass movie Miranda. While the story is not a big deal, the cuts made the movie much less enjoyable"
4,This is about a MILF.. period,"If you want to see a dialogue with sex and a bit of drama about a MILF, then this is your title - but if you ain't in to what I just said exactly well... then move on if you ain't into this particular director"
2,Has potential but Christian content stymies its usefulness.,"I was enjoying this book. I liked its unique focus - that of the resentments that all members of a stepfamily have and how they undermine the successful functioning of the new family unit. However, when the authors were discussing the essential components of a good marriage and wrote that the woman has to be ready to ""submit (or adapt herself)"" to her husband, I got a really sour taste in my mouth. After that, knowing that the book was based on this traditional, conservative interpretation of Christian beliefs vastly reduced my confidence that this book was going to have anything useful for me and my new family. I think the use of Christian values is fine - traditional or contemporary, if that's what you're looking for. However, this perspective should be prominently listed on the book as it is a major assumption and is a value that a large number of people today do not necessarily share."
3,Power has many facets,"Jane Chance's discussion includes some valuable insights and a useful review of research, however it suffers from three main problems:a. The discussion of power is one-sided and focuses too much on the power of language, while neglecting issues such as the power of vision and the gaze, which are just as prominent. This makes the application of Foucault's theories - a good idea in itself -superficial (The author refers to one book of his out of a vast corpus).b. Any discussion of the structure of The Lord of the Rings cannot disregard the vast work that Christopher Tolkein has done on the various layers and stages of the volumes of the book.c. Chance's book is marred by many errors: for example, how can Germany have blockaded England in 1946, a year after the end of the war? In this context, the author should have mentioned Tolkein's own discussion of the relationship between his work and the Second World War."
2,Don't take a Chance on this book,"I'm very disappointed in this book. The author is wrong about basic facts on which she bases her theories. To wit:Frodo does not, as the author claims, use the Ring ""to test resistance to institutionalized power and the power of others within the community."" He doesn't ""use"" the Ring at all; if anything, it uses him. Gandalf's Elven ring does not save Frodo from the Nazgul at the Ford on the way to Rivendell; at that point in the story, we don't know that Gandalf has one of the Elven rings. ""Mordor"" may mean""murder"" in Anglo-Saxon, and that may have been in the back of Tolkien's mind; but ""Mordor"" mean ""black-land"" in Sindarin, and that's the meaning Tolkien wanted for the land. Durin's Bane is not mithril or greed (though that is an issue), but the Balrog.Dr. Chance does makes several interesting points, and for that reason I might, albeit with much hesitation, recommend this book to those who are familiar enough with LotR to avoid the pitfalls."
4,Excellent insight into Lotr,"Overall coverage of the entire trilogy is excellent and she provides logic as to where Tolken was going with his writing. She also includes info from Joseph Campbell about mythology and the role of hero. Overall a very interesting, useful and enjoyable read."
3,Sense of Time,"""South of Stephen"" is my introduction to Stephen Kellogg's music. I see that he has about five different CDs out; so he's obviously done well enough to keep recording after this set from 2000. This CD is pretty good. Kellogg has a pleasing voice on this folk-flavored disc. The strongest track is the opener. ""Southern State of Mind"" has a good beat and a midtempo full-band arrangement. Kellogg's vocals are wistful, ""Until I cross Montgomery & I lose my sense of time; Just for a second I forget it all; I make my way across the next state line."" ""Fading In"" is a good rocker. Much of the other material has strong lyrics but suffers from melodies that are not overly memorable. ""South of Stephen"" is an interesting introduction to this artist and shows promise. Enjoy!"
4,YET ONE MORE GREAT CTI RELEASE FROM THE 70'S,"GEORGE BENSON , KEITH JARRETT, RON CARTER, BILLY COBHAM, HUBERT LAWS AND FREDDIE HUBBARD WERE SOME OF THE MOST PROLIFIC JAZZ RECORDING ARTISTS OF THE 1970'S AND THEY ARE ALL HERE ON THIS CTI RECORDS RELEASE FROM THE MID 70'S. I HAVE HAD THIS RECORD/CASSETTE/CD SINCE IT CAME OUT, IT IS AS GOOD TODAY AS IT WAS WHEN IT WAS RELEASED. I AM GLAD ALL OF THE OLD CTI RECORDS ARE FINALLY BEING RELEASED BY SONY ON CD, IT'S ABOUT TIME."
2,Lasted for four days,"As a Christmas gift for our 2 year old twins and 4 year old boy, this seemed like the perfect toy on day 1. They had a blast jumping around and bouncing on the soft, springy bed. When it popped on day 4, they weren't as excited. Like most of the other reviewers here, it continued to develop holes along seam lines at a rate too fast to keep up with patching. Then the main floor developed a hernia, the bottom section developed a rip along the seam and Intex does not cover any of this by warranty. If you do buy, expect a week of fun and then disappointment as it gradually deflates from apparent manufacturing defects."
2,Leaked in three spots with a month.,Santa brought this toy to my two year old for Christmas. Here it is less than a month later and I had to deflate it and take it away from my son. Both of the chambers you actually jump on have holes along with one of the wall chambers. He loved it and is sad to see it go. I made sure it was always away from anything that could hurt it and never let him take toys in it. If a two year old can pop it from jumping alone than there are serious flaws with this product. Spend your money else where.
2,Great idea if it worked,"This is a great idea for burning off energy when the weather is bad. Ours lasted three days before a seam split while our 4 yr old was jumping in it. This happened within the 30 day replacement period, but I don't know yet if CMS Worldwide Sales will live up to their guarentee - or if the next one will last longer."
3,Great while it lasted,"I bought this for my sons and they enjoyed it, A LOT. After two months, I noticed the two bottom compartments were not hold air well. We have a large air compressor, so it was easy to inflated. After awhile, I found it needed to be re-inflated almot daily and then the walls started deflated. I about had it at that point.Great bouncer, but NOT durable at all."
2,Daughter to emergency room after this toy,"We bought this jumpolene for our toddler and he liked it okay, but then my 5 year old daughter started bouncing in it. She landing wrong on her neck/head and was screaming and said she couldn't move her arms. (sounded like spinal injury to me)We rushed to the emergency room. 8 hours, 50 tests including cat scans and MRI's later, we left with a brace around her neck for the next week. Thank god for insurance because the bill was over $8000.She's fine now, but the jumpolene went into the trash the next day.Now, of course this type of accident can happen anywhere your children are bouncing (beds, trampolines, etc) and sitting there watching them jump is no protection... you can't prevent an accident when you don't know it's about to happen.I just wanted to warn parents about this type of toy."
2,"Make sure you have a pump, and it leaks!","Like other reviews, ours was fun while it lasted, but it didn't last long. We received ours as a gift from Grandma, to keep our two bouncing boys active in the winter. We didn't have a pump, so we had to blow it up on our own. It. Took. Forever. It doesn't look too big online, but when you come face to face with this thing with only your own lungs to fill it, it's huge.We had it up for a few weeks, indoors, with carpets, but it still got leaks. Every chamber except one got a slow to medium-speed leak, which we couldn't find. In the end, we set it up one last time (using an air mattress pump), had a few bounces before it deflated later in the day, and put it on Craigslist.For free."
2,Fun while it lasted.,"The size is just right for kids 5 and under... room to jump, romp and get creative. It takes forever to get the thing inflated, but child anticipation is priceless. We were able to set up a couple diff locations pending some arranging in rooms, so that was great. The down fall was the amount of use we got out of it before an air leak. We used the patch, but due to the leak being at a seam in the top bumper, we only slowed it down. Then we got another leak on the base, again at the seam. Impossible to seal with just a patch. Slowed it down once again, before we got a puncture somehow in the base again.. This all in about a 2 months time... I didn't expect it leak proof, but if a seam is going to give out, which is where I would think most leaks would happen, I wish they'd provided a glue to, to seal it properly with the patch."
4,...,"I am now shopping for a third Jumpolene. The first one was purchased 5 years ago ... and lasted about 2 years, slowing dying the entire time. The second one was bought 6 months later ...and lasted 1 year before the chambers began deflating, 1 at a time, over the course of 6 months. The ""repair"" patches are a joke, and no other repair kits would work, either. The ONLY reason that I search for one now is because my children LOVED it, and beg for another. I will get another if the price is right, but Intex needs to work on the craftmanship of its products if they wish to charge this much!"
3,Jumpolene too big for inside,"My daughter received this for Christmas when she was 3. Although she did love it and play w/ it for awhile, there really isn't as much bounce in it as a bouncy house would have. Also it is very large. It took up our entire living room. Then we moved it into her room and it overtook her room. It didn't seem sturdy enough to leave outside. Eventually it became a big toy collection area. I would say if you had a very large playroom then it would work well because of it's size. It's just too much."
3,A little disappointed...,"Bought this for my 20 month old grandson, who loves to jump and bounce on anything in sight; however, he had some difficulty getting in/out (which we overcame in a short time), BUT my main problem with this item is that it has a space between the bottom (jumping area) and the sides. My Grandson has gotten his foot caught in this space on several occasions...NOT A GOOD THING FOR SMALL ANKLES. On the POSITIVE side...even left out in the direct sun, this ""bouncer"" does not seem to get hot."
1,poor product,This was a Christmas gift for two young girls. After two weeks the center chamber (floor) of Jump o Lene deflated. We contacted CMS worldwide and reported the problem. They made suggestions as how to fix the problem. Nothing worked. We called and emailed the company. They emailed and stated they would send a patch kit. That was the middle of January. It is now the end of March and we haven't received the kit or has the company returned any further calls or emails. We will not be purchasing another Jump o Lene nor will we be purchasing another product from CMS worldwide.
2,Won't last long,"I have the ""castle"" version of the Jumpolene. It too popped the bottom chamber after about 6 months. I have to blow it up again every day. But, it lasts about 5-6 hours and only takes 30 seconds or so to inflate with an electric pump...so not the end of the world.The chamber you bounce on popped the other day. I can inflate it again, but it only lasts about 30 minutes."
5,jump-o-lene,"order came quick for granddaughter just love it had at birthday party all the kids loved it80"" x 27"" Jump-o-Lene"
2,Poor quality,"Top seam of Jump-o-lene was not sealed correctly and broke within 1st month of use. My children are terribly disappointed, but still use the bottom. Wish there was an inflatable jump-o-lene out there that was worth the money. This is my 4th purchased and I haven't found one yet."
3,Great for use as a ball pit,"We bought this for use as a ball pit and its worked well for that. The top 2 rings do delfate quite easily for no one jumping in it. I would say my 2 yr old is in it on average of twice a week (he weighs 31 lbs) and is the only person who uses it and we have to pump it back up for each use. We have an electric pump so its not that big of a deal, but if you have older children who will be using it daily, it may turn into a hassle. We keep it in the play room that's in the basement (so its quite chilly) so this may be why it deflates easily. My recommendation is that if you are not going to be using it everyday or as something other than a trampoline, its a good deal. If you have older children who are going to be jumping regularly, invest in a good electric pump b/c you're going to need it!"
3,Bought for a toddler,Love the concept of this item. My grandaughter loves bouncing in this and it provides support where you do not have to worry about them falling out. Unfortunately it developed leaks in it and she only got a couple of months of use out of it. It would help if they reinforced the top ring so pin hole air leaks do not occur so easily. Overall not worth the money for the amount of time we got to use it.
1,Mine punctured too soon,"This product did not seem to be too strong, it punctured in less than 3 months. My kids did not jump on it a lot either so I question the strength of workmanship. Be careful when you buy this and if you do, buy it with a card that offers purchase protection."
3,Jump-o-lene,"My grandchildren have fun with this, but the middle ring did deflate soon after purchase and I can't figure out where the leak is. It is still usable - just not as high around the sides as it should be. We use it inside and it takes a considerable amount of space."
4,nice toy,"I bought this toy in teh summer of 2009. I inflated it easily with a pump (I think bought separately). the kids had a blast.. my youngest was less than 1 and she couldn't keep up with older kids but as she grew older, she enjoyed more.after few months of usage, it needed to be regularly inflated. it wouldn't go down completely. the upper rims lost air the fastest and I think one of them developed a bigger hole so I stopped inflating it.We left one night outside and It filled with rainwater. that was it. It filled compltely and it became immovable. (when u leave it outside, better to turn it over). we tried to empty it initially with a bucket but it took so long. I tried turning it over but wasn't successful. I eventually made a hole in the bottom and we had to throw it away. All in all, I think it is really fun to have. the kids love it especially when they started jumping off the sofa into it.The four stars is because of the upper rims and the small minimal significant air leaks."
2,Great idea cheaply made,"This seemed like the perfect answer for our daughter's ball pit: soft, high-sided, and bouncy on the bottom. We purchased it for her for Christmas and set it up Christmas eve. She absolutely loved it for a little while, and probably still would if it hadn't sprung leaks EVERYWHERE. It is now January 9th, and in spite of taking care not to exceed the weight limit and to avoid having shoes and sharp items near the jump-o-lene, etc, normal use by our 35lbs 3-year old has resulted in a flattened bottom (both chambers) and a flat top ring. Sadly, I can't recommend this product because of the cheap material and/or production that results in it breaking in record time. I am frustrated to find myself in the market for a replacement so soon after setting it up! Keep in mind that, due to the fact that there were ballpit balls inside, very little actual JUMPING took place! Mostly playing and flopping over, and aparently even that was too much! What a disappointment."
1,Junk-o-lene,"My 6, 5, and 4 year old loved the jumpolene for about 2 hours before it popped. We were careful not exceed the weight limit by only letting 2 kids go at a time. We supervised them carefully and they weren't crazy in it. Fun while it lasted, but c'mon, 2 hours? Ridiculous. We used our inflatable swimming pool as a ball pit prior to this and it lasted 2 years."
2,I'm on #4 due to holes!!!!,"I am on my fourth jump-o-lene in 2 months. I keep exchanging them because they either have holes to begin with or develop holes within a couple of months. A great concept, but poorly made!! My 1 and 2 year old absolutely LOVE playing in it though!!"
2,Did not last,"We purchased this product for our 2 younger children (ages 3 and 2). Our children are very mello (compared to others their age) and the product popped at the seam. We haven't had it up for 2 months, we would probably use it once every two weeks to play. Very disappointed. We had a smaller cheaper one from Target that lasted longer than this."
2,Not pleased,Interms of fun my 2yr old and 3yr old had lots of fun jumping and bouncing around. It started leaking air frm the seam and I can't find it. This is the second jumpolene I've purchased this year because my kids do enjoy it. The price should be cheaper because you can't keep it a long time. Make some improvements and you can have all of my business!!!
2,2 leaks!,Received this as a gift for my sons 2nd birthday. We blew it up with the air mattress pump and later in the day found 2 leaks in the seams that are impossible to repair. Wish it was manufactured better. The little guy is going to be so sad when he wakes up and it's gone.
2,It Deflates Constantly!,"I bought this item for my daughter (who is a 34 pound 3 year old) in October. The first day we bought it, we inflated it and she jumped around in it for hours. The following day, the center deflated. And it's been like that daily ever since.This has not even seen outdoor use; it's been in our playroom for the entire time we've owned it and the only thing that goes inside is my daughter. There is no reason for this thing to leak - I could understand if it had contact with sharp objects of any kind, but it hasn't. It deflates every single day, and we have to find and patch holes, then re-inflate it. It's a pain in the butt.I give it 2 stars because my daughter loves it when it's working, but I'm sorry we bought it for her. The toy should be more durable than this. Save your money and find something that doesn't leak."
1,Zero for Two,"I ordered one last year and zone 4 and 6 didn't hold air. I had no problem returning the product but this review is for the actual product. I ordered one again in November and zones 2,5 didn't hold air. Very poor product in regards to quality control."
4,Everyone around our house loves this!,"Our toddler loves to jump in it, her friends love to jump in it, our neighbors love to jump in it, but we have discovered that there is a leak in the floor. The floor is made up of two chambers and there is a leak in the top one. Of course the leak is on the bottom side of the chamber and is not serviceable, so I have to fill it back up each time we use it.Other than that, the jump-o-lene has been a fan favorite at birthday parties and is now living it up in the basement as part of the ""play room"""
1,Not really a great jumper,I bought the Jump-O-Lene for my son and was very disappointed with it. It really is not a great jumper. It claims you can leave it outside even in the rain and it will not fill up with water. Well mine is now a swimming pool. I would not reccomend this product to anyone.
1,Bugs enjoyed it more than kids,"I bought this thinking it was a great alternative to a regular trampoline. I kept it outside, covered, but that didn't stop bugs from making homes in it everyday. They would go in the crevice between the floor and sides. It didn't matter much because my daughter didn't enjoy it at all, there was hardly any bounce to it no matter how much or how little air I put in it. It went in the garbage."
1,Seams Split HUGE UPSET,"I got this for my 22 lb 1 year old and 38 lb 3 year old for Christmas. They loved it for two weeks then the seam split open leaving a 6"" hole in the largest air chamber. No patching this weak seam. Now my boys are sad and they asked why Santa brought them a broken ball pit. Very disappointed as this was for both my boys ""big"" Christmas gift and was very expensive with the 1,000 balls and high priced shipping. Now left with 1,000 balls all over the playroom. I emailed CMS WorldWide Sales - Amazon Marketplace and a George asked for pictures which I sent. Almost March and still nothing...."
2,piece-o-crap,"My daughter is 40 pounds and I could not get enough air into this so that she didn't hit the ground (through the inflated bottom) when jumping. Not so fun. She learned to jump ""lightly,"" but c'mon."
2,"Waterlogged, not Airtight.","It worked great indoors but when I left it outside during a rainstorm, water found its way into the inflatable rings. So I now have water inside the thing and no way to completely drain it. If I do salvage it, I will keep it indoors from now on. No apparent leak, but it's obviously not airtight.This could be a great toy indoors. I'm only warning others that it may not work outdoors.Another issue is that it has a strong chemical odor - the reason I left it outside in the first place."
4,Great as a bouncer or a ball pit!!,"We purchased this to have at my daughters first birthday, upon arrival my husband blew it up and sat it in our living room for two months before the party. It was a hit, we used it with and without balls for months, lots of one and two and three year olds bounced, then the bigger kids got to for a little while. Since then it has been used at lots of our friends birthday parties and my daughters second birthday!! Great item it has held up really well, when not in use it is deflated in a green tote in the garage and it seems to be good storage."
2,disappointing,"I bought the toy for my grandaughters birthday and after inflating it, the top ring slowly leaked and went flat. There was a tiny tiny hole in the seam. The toy cost 29.00 and I paid 20.00 for the shipping. The company that sold the toy wanted me to pay to ship it back to them. The toy is great fun. It is a great idea, If only it had not been defective."
2,It deflated after 3 weeks,"I bought this product for my active 2 and 4 year old boys. We kept it inside and after only 3 weeks one of the seams busted. We are unable to patch such a large hole and the company refused to replace it claiming it was overinflated. We had used it within the guidelines provided and had it inflated to firm, as the directions advised. Therefore, I am unsatisfied with the product."
4,"My son loves it, but larger then it appears in picture","My son loved this item when I got it blown up and ready for him to play with. The sides are not super stiff so he can climb in and out of it himself. He is 20 months old and about 36 inches tall. It is easier for him to get in then out. There are times when he gets ""stuck"" and ends up hanging upside down over the sides. It is a fun toy...I want to jump in it, but I exceed the weight limit. It is a bit larger then what the photos shows with the 2 kids in it so make sure you have the room for it."
2,Only lasted a week,My four year old and two year old got this for Christmas but it only lasted a week before it split down a seam. Customer service hasn't returned my call.
2,Fragile...come on this is a JUMPING Toy!,"We bought this and used it starting on Christmas day (today is January 8....13 days later). The top ring is now deflating. I found the hole, a small tear in the seam between the upper and middle ring. Clearly this is a defect and not due to my kids putting hole in it. My kids are 5 and 3 and about 40 and 30 pounds each. I am really disappointed in this. I have written the company asking for a replacement and will let you know what happens. An inflatable jumping toy should last longer than 13 days (we were even on vacation for 5 of them)."
2,Full of Holes,"Inflated the Jump-o-Lene Christmas eve to find a leak in the top ring. Used the patch kit provided, hole fixed. Christmas day, floor seemed low so filled up with air again. Next day floor was flat. Multiple leaks (holes) in every area. Too many to find in one day. Looking for a return or refund. Not built as well as one i bought 10 years ago."
2,Save Your Money,This toy has not held air from the first day. I have to blow it up every time my kids want to jump on it. I say save your money and just buy a trampoline.
4,My grandson loves this,"I bought a jump-o-lene to keep at our house when our 2-year-old grandson comes to visit. Two was a little too young, but now that he's closer to three he loves it, and wants to use it several times whenever he's here. It's bigger than I thought, and takes up a lot of space in our downstairs family room. We have to stand it up on one end or roll it into another room when it's not in use because we don't have enough room to leave it, and I don't want to deflate and inflate it all the time. We haven't had any trouble with punctures, but we don't allow toys or hard objects to be used in it. I would love to be able to have it outside in the summer, but again, it's a storage problem if left inflated. Overall though, I would recommend it. Great physical exercise; great fun!"
3,"Kids loved it, but didn't last long","We got one of these for about 35 at a sports store when our kids were 2 and 4. Along with a manual air pump and some of those ballpit balls. The kids LOVED it. Had so much fun bouncing around together, it seemed like the perfect toy. But after about a month, the air began to leak. And I found the repair kit pretty useless. Overall we were able to use it heavily for about 3 months before there were too many holes to be functional. (We only ever used it indoors.) So I probably wouldn't get it again, but my kids had so much fun I'm glad we got it once."
2,Super Fun but No Warranty,"I purchased this for Christmas for my 3 year old Niece and 2 year old Nephew along with $100 worth of balls. They absolutely loved this and had a ball jumping up and down for about 2 weeks and then the seam split. I contacted Intex this morning and was told all their products do not have ANY warranty, so I now have $100's worth of balls and nothing to do with them or I purchase another one and hope it last longer than the first one. For $60, I really hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks. I could understand if I had this outside an the kids poked a hole in it but the seam split. This is too much of an investment for the time they got to play with it."
3,Works good,"This worked good , we used it in our house that we just bought to keep the kids out of our hair . Just dont put it out side if its going to rain ."
1,NOT a ball pit unless you want to make it a $$$ pit...,"Honestly, I don't know what on earth I was thinking. How many balls would it take to make this an adequate ball pit for a 2 and 4 year old? Not sure but it is a lot more than the 300 + we already have. I'm guessing 2000 or more might make it OKAY. The quality of this product is not worth the money. It is not at all trampoline like as advertised - so, it's only good as a ball pit. It is not sturdy enough to stand up to the basic jumping of toddlers, let alone a child of even 1/2 the weight limit. Not that it would matter - only toddlers would be happy with the total lack of bounce of the thing. The Jump-o-Lene is a great idea that has fallen really short."
1,No durable toy,"En dos dias se le abrio un hueco y mi hijo ni siquiera salto solo jugo sentadito, no lo recomiendo porque aunque el producto fue muy barato yo tuve que traerlo a otro pais donde gaste en flete e impuestos para que me dure dos dias no gracias."
2,Very Poor Quality,"I bought this product as a gift for my daughter's birthday. Thinking she would love it. Her (2 yr old) and her sister (5 yr old) got one use of about 15 minutes out of it before the seam broke. I was very disappointed, and would not recommend this product."
3,Jump-O-Lene for fun,"I was so excited to get this product. My kids really enjoy(ed) it. Its a pretty good size, not to small, and yet doesnt take up wayy to much room!. I have 2 small children who use(d) it. It did say not for children older than 6 and i can see why. With my 2 kids in it, they did bounce in it everyday for a week when it got 2 holes. One in the bottom floor and one on the top ring. They werent allowed to take toys in it as I feared something would like this would happen. (or hurt themselves) It was a great product while it lasted. I did fix the holes and they are able to use it again however I wish it would have been a little more durable.Overall, I am satisfied with the price and the enjoyment my kids got out of it. however, i will do more research next time to see if i can find something a little more sturdy."
4,Durability an issue,"Although my children enjoyed using this toy, the top level deflated after 2 days and the bottom ring had a hole within 2 weeks. We were very disappointed in this product."
2,Grandkids Give It A Two Thumbs Down,"I have two Grandaughters ages 4 and almost 2, who love to jump and play. I thought sure this would be a great present for them. They could use it inside the house to jump and have fun. They would only jump for a minute or two and then they wanted out of the thing. It takes up too much room to keep it out when they don't want to use it."
1,not as much fun as you'd think,"We bought this toy for our 2 year old daughter who loves to jump, but was less than impressed with this toy. She is only 2lbs and within one day it had a hole it. Also the toy does not bounce very well. Within minutes she lost interest. Needless to say we are returning this pointless toy for something more fun."
1,Disappointed,We purchased this for our daughter who has sensory intergration. Her therapy teacher mention this would be nice for her to have at home. Purchased one from Amazon and only filled it up with air once. The Jump-o-lene does not keep air in it at all. We have to blow it up each time she wants to use it. Very disappointed with this product.
2,"Fun toy, will not last","This was a great toy for my son but only lasted a few months - the seams split on the top rings in order and finally on the base. Not patchable with normal patches since the tears are on the seams. I got a different model also made by Intex and this one lasted even less. Great fun if you don't mind spending the money for a month or two's worth of playtime, but I would not recommend it for the price."
3,Great but won't last more than 6 months,"This was our favorite toy, but it developed SO many tears along the edges. I have 2 VERY rambunctious boys and from diving in and out of the trampoline they eventually tore so many holes in the sides that it wasn't fun to play in any more."
4,Great for hyper kids!,"I ordered this for my daughter for her 2nd birthday. I thought it would be nice for her and help me out by letting her burn off some of her extra energy! Since we set it up, she has been in it all the time! She likes to put her little foam chair in it and sit there to watch TV. She'd probably eat all her meals in there too, if I let her!! I love the height of the side ""rail""; it is just tall enough that she won't fly out of it while she's jumping, but short enough for her to climb in and out of on her own. We have had no problems with any of the cells deflating or any leaks so far! It is HUGE, so if you don't have a big room to put it in I would recommend you not buy it. It is a lot of fun and well worth every penny ;)"
3,"much fun, even though the trampolene lasted only a few days","Great exercise for kids during these long winter months here in Minnesota.The Jump-0-Lene arrived on a cold day : 15 or so degrees.We brought it indoors, waited an hour or so for it to thaw out, then opened the package and unfolded it, and, just as the directions warned, we waited to inflate it until it fully thawed out.It leaks air and requires refilling faster than I can keep up, so it's been in our dining area deflated for the past three weeks.The company has not responded yet to our email and tel msg: it's been 3 weeks."
2,Great fun but a piece of junk,"My twin four-year-olds love this thing when it's working. Usually it's not.Usually one of its chambers has sprung a leak. At this writing, three of the five chambers don't hold air. The only reason I'm able to MAYBE fix it this time around is that the family's out of town and I have all day to find and try to repair the leaks.None of these leaks are punctures. All of them are the result of seams coming apart. The seams on the jumping surface itself have also failed; you can't see it in the photo on the Amazon page, but there are parallel inflated ribs where the kids jump. One of the seams between two ribs has failed, creating one big mega-rib. Another such seam has also started to fail.This isn't a one-star review because when it's working, it's great. But I'd recommend you look for something else. It was a terrific thing to have around for the first few days, but has been unusable most of the time since then."
1,Great while it lasted......29 days!!!,"Got this jump o lene to replace another castle jump o lene from last Christmas that lasted 5 months. We found the 2 holes in the castle and kept patching it for 4 months before finally giving up. Bought another one, just not the castle one because my kids still love to play with the 400 balls we have in it. Bought in early November and 29 days later it was leaking in the bottom compartment. I have to blow it up 2-3 times a day now. Amazon rep would only give partial refund and we have to pay return shipping. Pretty sad when a product that's meant for jumping and was never used for jumping springs a leak that's impossible to find. And pretty sad that Amazon won't take it back for full refund. Some customer service. Target or Walmart would have taken it back for a full refund........NO QUESTIONS ASKED!!!!"
2,We are sad....,"Wonderful concept, but in two weeks it got a hole. I had to pump it up every day. Now, at 8 months, it has several holes (which are taped up) and a broken inflator nozzle. The chambers won't even hold air long enough for the kids to jump in it. I guess I'll look at buying a bouncer with a blower, and maybe that will stay inflated."
5,Great way to keep kids active indoors!,"We got this bouncer for our two year old son to use indoors when the weather is bad, and he absolutely loves it! Every cousin who comes over makes a bee-line for this it, and it keeps the kids busy for hours! I am very pleased with the quality of the item, and many people have commented how cool it looks, and will be buying one for their children.I know I'll be esp. grateful for this bouncer in the winter!!"
2,"Great fun, before it deflated.","We got this for our 5 year old daughter and 20 month old twin boys. The base and the bottom ring are very thick and seem like they'd hold up over time. The upper rings, however, are not as durable.The kids all loved it -- jumping, sitting, running and otherwise burning off energy in it. We only kept it inside, and the top ring deflated after about a week. Try as we did, we could NOT find the leak and ended up sending it back.After the aggravation of having this and other blow up toys that have deflated on us, we opted not to replace it."
2,not as durable as I had hoped,"a birthday present for my two-year old - he got two weeks out of it before puncturing the top inflatable ring. it's still usable, just not so attractive with the limp edge. probably would have kept shopping had I thought the window of use in intact condition would be so short."
2,Not the safest toy,"I bought this for my 18 month old grandson and it's a lot of fun if you can have two adults ""spotting"", but if not, I think it's a very dangerous toy. He's now 24 months and I no longer allow him to play in it as a trampoline because of the fear of neck/head injury. The walls are not very sturdy and he tumbled out of it more than he landed in it. We also had problems with it staying inflated."
1,Unsafe; walls too low,"My 2-year-old flipped out of this right away. We took it down after 1 hour. Our 1-year-old almost flipped out too and probably would have, if I kept it up. The walls are simply too low for this to be safe. Flipping out of it, my son snapped his neck. He was fine, but I was worried about what could have happened. Also, the two children crashed into one another all the time, hurting one another. Mainly due to wall height, this is an unsafe product. Sure, it was plenty fun for them. It's too bad it did not work out.Another thing to note is that there is a strong vinyl smell (which is supposed to be toxic, right)? In addition, the product is very large and didn't really fit anywhere without taking up a whole room. It takes a long time to inflate with an electric pump, so once it's up, it's up. Do not buy."
2,"lot's of fun, not durable","I bought this toy for my 2 boys, 4 and 2, and they loved it. I even bought balls to make a ball pit. The toy is huge which I know everyone said, but you can't really get an idea of it's size until you see it. One bag of balls was definitely not close to being enough, however, before I could even buy more, it got a hole in the middle of the bottom. That was only about two days after putting it up. After that every couple of days a ring would get a hole in it. By the end of about two weeks only one ring was still inflated. I thought about going to get a pool patch kit, but I realized that if I patched one hole another would come somewhere else.Bottom line, if you have the time and patience to look for and patch holes or if you go into it not expecting to have it for long go for it. The kids love it. Maybe your kids won't be as hard on it. My girls had one when they were little and it was fine."
5,Jump O Lene,We bought this and 100 fun balls for my grandson's 1st birthday. He loved it played in it for hours. It was a hit with the other children at the party also.
4,GREAT fun for lots of ages!!,"We purchased a Jumpolene as a gift for some friends with twin boys. Both boys PLUS my son would jump like crazy outside. Then my son received his own for his fourth birthday. While we have only had it set up inside, it has held up great (even to 120lb+++ Nana laying across the sidewalls!!). My younger son (16 mo) also is able to get in and out on his own, -so it's great for toddler fun too!! We've had as many as five pre-schoolers jumping at once and it's held up great! Now I'm buying one for my nephew..."
1,Not as much fun as it looks...,"This product seems like it's hit or miss. Miss if you receive a defective product like I did. The top chamber would not inflate for us on Christmas Eve. Our children were not able to ""bounce"" or ""jump"". Dissapointing to say the least for what we thought would be the most exciting gift of the day.We had quite a bit of trouble getting a refund as we ordered this the day after Thanksgiving to ensure a Pre Christmas delivery, only to find out the manufacturer of this product will only warranty this item for 15 days from the recvd. ship date. 15 days...sounds like this Jump 0 lene has a short expiration date. Take a hint, not built to be used for intended purpose. I can quote Willy Goat,the company that shipped this product, ""We get calls all the time for this item breaking, but if it's past the 15 day warranty you have no right to a refund or replacement...even if you never used it."
4,Not worth it.,"Forget it! Spend your money in something else. It was great while it lasted, but the problem is that it only lasted 2 months. My kids got it last Christmas and by mid February it had a puncture and it was gone. The jump-o-lene does not include a repair kit and whatever you buy from the store will not make it!"
1,Seam split within a few months under non-excessive indoor use,"My sister bought this for my 3 and 4 year old boys for Christmas. I figured it'd get a hole in it eventually that I'd have to patch but unfortunately the seam of the top two rings split and we need to pitch this because it can't be repaired. I attemped to email Intex in case they might stand by their product, but the ""finish/send"" email button doesn't work on their site! What a dissapointment! The kids did have some fun with it while it was in tact but it's too cheap quality of a toy -- my advice don't purchase."
2,Fun but poorly made,After reading all the reviews we decided to take a chance and buy one. Seems we got one of the lemons. Son (age 4) loved it and was super careful not to take any toys in with him (not even a ping pong ball) after being told it could pop. Didn't matter. Seams began to split one after another within two weeks even though only one 40 lb. child was in it. All rules followed. We are down to one air side wall that will still hold air now. Destined for the trash! DISAPPOINTING!
3,blow me up...,"If you're planning on using this for a 'ball pit' it'll take about 800 x 3 1/2"" balls to fill this thing above the interior blue section (that's about 1/3 the total volume, btw).At least one section of this thing will not stay inflated more than one day without needing extra air (I'm on my 2nd exchange unit for this very reason).When it says ""not to be used unsupervised"" in 5 different languages, THEY MEAN IT.Do not let your children use this thing unsupervised.It's actually pretty good, don't expect it to last if you use it outside. On a carpeted floor, no shoes - socks only, this thing might last a while..."
2,It wont bounce? am I doing something wrong?,"Well it seems to make a better pool then tramolean, Maybe I didn't do something right. My daughter enjoys it but it is not what I expected."
2,Low Fat Low Sugar,Was not as good as I thought it would be. Measurements were in metrics. Not at all what I am used to.
3,A lone dissenter!,"I didn't really get drawn into this Anne Tyler book like I did ""The Accidental Tourist"" or ""Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant."" The charactes, while a bit quirky, didn't strike me as strange enough to people a Tyler novel.I liked the story, but I wasn't intrigued by the characters. None of them were true misfits. They seemed just a bit unusual, and that's not enough to hold my attention.Opal seemed the most complex character...and I wish the author had given Barnaby more time with her.I'll read Tyler again, but I won't purchase the next one. She's done more thorough work."
4,Great Book to Take on a Trip,"This book was a good read for me on a recent airplane trip. Anne Tyler works magic with details and Barnaby, his family, his possible angel, and his elderly customers at the Rent-a-Back Company all became very real. I might have been flying at 35,000 feet but as I read I was with Barnaby as he met the challenges of his free form life."
2,Must be an acquired taste,"I have friends who LOVE Anne Tyler, and keep prevailing upon me to try (and re-try) her books. So I have, with this one... But this kind of writing must be an acquired taste. I'm almost halfway into ""A Patchwork Planet"" -- and really, nothing has happened yet. Once again, we have this charmingly, almost poignantly purposeless character, incredibly passive, waiting for something to HAPPEN to him. Just as the reader waits for something (anything!) to happen to him. I want him to get up off his leisurely arse, take charge, and DO something! -- but he doesn't seem the type, so I doubt I'll bother finishing the book. This is probably due to a shortcoming on my part: I'm far too impatient to be deliberately set adrift in this casual, aimless sort of story."
2,Not her best,"I am always excited when a new Anne Tyler comes out but this is the first one that disappointed me. The story lags and the ending doesn't tie anything up...it just ends. I loved Ladder of Years and Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and many others. I'm glad this wasn't my first Tyler book, I might not have read the rest!"
4,A real book,"There are many differences between Korea and America. Family relationships are especially different, so I don't understand the first part of this book. But as I read this book more and more, I learned about Barnaby's situation. He doesn't fight others, but himself. Anne Tyler gives the way of life to us. What we learn from this book is the spirit of struggle. Barnaby overcomes hard situations by himself. I would like to introduce this book to teens and people situated in difficult conditions."
3,Patchwork is more like Patched Work,"While this is not the worst novel of Anne Tyler (""Tin Can Tree""), it is certainly not among her best, or even the majority of good ones. It was written not long after her husband's death, and I believe that her grief shows through in this novel, blotting out the strength of the novel's imaginary world -- always a mistake for a writer. The male character is strangely feminine, not passive but almost a woman in a man-suit, making him seem unbelievable. I never felt attached to the Gaitlins or Sophia, as I loved the characters of Tyler's other novels, including her latest, well-written and memorable novel, ""Back When We Were Grownups."" Read it if you must, but please do not believe that this is the height of Tyler's capability. She has done and does much, much better."
3,Not Anne Tyler's best effort,"I began this book with great anticipation because I am a big fan of Anne Tyler's work -- my favorites are Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and Ladder of Years. This story began promisingly enough, but was ultimately unsatisfying. So much was left hanging -- and even though this is not unusual in one of her novels, I felt at the end as though I didn't really care what happened to the main characters beyond the final page, and that IS unusual.I also didn't think that Tyler's device of writing in the male first person worked very well. I'm not saying it can't be done, but in this particular book, it felt stilted and not as authentic a voice as I'm used to from her. While I'll grant that even a mediocre book from a writer of Tyler's caliber is better than the best efforts of many other writers, this one felt like a noble experiment that didn't quite pan out."
3,Ordinary People,"Unfortunately if one has read much Tyler, one begins to be able to predict the outcomes (if not the actual plots) of her novels. This is not a bad book by any means. It has good character definition, passable dialog, etc. It would actually make a fairly good play - very little in the way of sets would be necessary, too. I guess I wanted a little more - some surprises or something."
2,"Easy to put down, hard to pick back up","I was really disappointed by this one. I couldn't connect with any of the characters. In fact, I couldn't wait for 'em to go away. I've liked other Anne Tyler books. But here, the quirkiness is missing. All that's left is the pathetic. One reader commented that the author failed in her attempt to project a viable male persona as the voice of the piece. I felt this jarringly apparent. I kept thinking ""A guy wouldn't notice this, or be concerned about that."" But most of all, I was aware that I didn't like any of these people, didn't care what happened to them, and saw no chemistry anywhere. Sorry."
2,The worst book I've read in a long time!,"I read this book because of the acclaim and praise Anne Tyler has received from her past books, and was very surprised to find such a shallow, simple-minded story. Tyler did not think this story through. It seems to have been hastily written, perhaps for an impatient publisher. I found the main character anything but ""lovable,"" but rather, a true loser with very little redeeming qualities. Why would I want to spend my time reading about such a person?"
4,kooky square,"once again ms. tyler creates a pathetic hombre. this barnaby fella personifies chump. he basically is a functional celibate, 9 years removed from his last time in the rack. sad, sorry creation and yet a worthy pile of words."
4,In Our Own Way,"Anne Tyler created a novel based on perceptions; our own and other's. The main character, Barnaby Gaitlin has struggled with perceptions most of his life.We all know a Barnaby Gaitlin. Barnaby is what most would call a loser. He has little ambition, a shady past; a family that he can't live up to; a going-no-where job; and a daughter who couldn't care a less about him. Need I say more...Have we ever thought about what this person is really about? Anne Tyler did as she chronicaled a crossroad in Barnaby's life.A Patchwork Planet is a moving account of the human spirit. The lengths we go to meet the standards of others and the complexity of our relationships. We will experience Barnaby's trials and failures as he climbs to respect and love, all on his own terms. Anne Tyler has a new fan! This was the first Anne Tyler novel that I have read, and I highly recommended it to all."
5,"Beautiful, just beautiful.","I have read almost all of Anne Tyler's books but this, by far, is the best.Beautifully written, engaging characters, and what an incredible main character in Barnaby Gaitlin.I was open-mouthed the whole way through thinking about how Tyler's mind works and where these beautiful words came from.I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat. I defy you not to love Barnaby, want to slap Sophia silly, and even feel sorry for his mother who, because of her own deep insecurities about being born into a 'low-station' in life, treats her son lesser than she should.I loved that the opening line was a question, and the final line was Barnaby's realization that, yes indeed, what others thought about him WAS true.Beautiful book."
2,Not worth the time,"As a Baltimore ""neighbor"" of Tylers, I feel compelled to read her books. I keep hoping that the familiarity of Roland Park and other locales will endear me more to her and her characters. It doesn't. I find many of her books to be repetitive and boring. Her story lines are shallow and I am led to believe that those who adore her are not in search of compelling stories but safe tales of average people who just get by. I'll keep trying, but not buying."
5,Compassionate.,"""Patchwork"" is the perfect description for this Tyler novel: the mismatched, dysfunctional world that is Barnaby's. Looking for his ""angel,"" he finds her in the person of an elder client and an unanticipated finale leaves the reader in profound thought. A great walk through the life of a misunderstood young man."
3,Anticipation turns to disappointment,"Anne Tyler's latest book, ""A Patchwork Planet"" was a disappointment to me. Eagerly I wait each time for her books to come to print, and this one, sadly enough, was a disappointment. Unlike ""Ladder of Years"" or her older books like ""Clock Winder"" or ""Morgan's Passing"" I did not find Barnaby Gaitlin as Tyler's quintessentially quirky characters, which is a huge reason why I love Anne Tyler as a novelist. The book was an easy read but I just was not drawn into the novel like her other books. Unlike her other characters, like Delia in ""Ladder of Years"" or Elizabeth (Gillespie) in ""Clock Winder"", Barnaby's character did not appeal to me. Also, Tyler's typical humor was missing in her newest book. I wouldn't tell other people don't bother with this book, but I was sadly disappointed at her latest effort."
5,My first Anne Tyler novel - not disappointing!,"This was my very first Anne Tyler novel - I picked it up after hearing so many great things about her writing. I was not disappointed in the least. I thought this was a very good book, well-written and touching. The story kept me involved, and was one where you wonder what the characters are doing even when you're not reading the book!There were several times when this book made me laugh out loud - and a time or two when I got tears in my eyes. I will miss Barnaby and Sophia and will always wonder what became of them..."
4,More Memorable Characters,"I have been an Anne Tyler fan since a friend introduced me to ""Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant"" years ago. I savor every minute I am reading one of her books. This novel came to my attention when it was advertised in a popular book club flier. I didn't even know she had published a new book (too busy to pay attention these days). Barnaby was not as ""real"" to me as were some other of her characters, but the descriptions of the elderly clients of Rent-A-Back were right on target. As usual, Tyler makes you feel grateful for the calm and sanity of your own life. In my case, a life free of food-related disasters like the Thanksgiving dinner of only sweet foods. It's a lovely day-long read at the lake or beach house."
4,Listen to the audiotape,"I listened to the Books on Tape audiotape of this (unabridged) and it was delightful. A good reader. A good novel to listen to. Charming, light, a nice little romance and a fairly realistic look at aging."
1,I didn't like it,"I really enjoyed Breathing Lessons and The Accidental Tourist so I thought by reading some of the posted reviews that I would enjoy this one as well.I found this book pointless. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere, make someone endearing, but instead it fell flat and left a rather unpleasant feeling of wasting my time.What really gets me is at the end of this book Barnaby states in a letter to Sophia that he was a man you can trust. A man she could trust? He lied to her every time he looked into her eyes after sleeping with Martine and never telling her about it. He treated every woman that was closed to him (his daughter, mother, Martine, Sophia, and Wicky if you think about it with that crude grapefruit remark) with a blatant disregard that was very disconcerting."
1,"Yawn yawn yawn, not well written","This book is poorly written. It's too boring to even put me to sleep. The main character is not likable, not someone I""d want to know, not someone I care about. I just started reading this and am trying with all my might to keep reading, but it drags on. The main character is missing something, I want to feel like I like him, but I can't! he is a rebel but not well crafted enough so far to be heroic in an every day way."
2,A Whole Lot of Nothing,"This is my first Anne Tyler book. I have to say that by the time I finished it I was so mad I had spent the time to read it. She developed the characters well and there were several funny, cynical parts, but nothing HAPPENS. I like for the character to accomplish something, or to resolve a problem, or to learn something. The story is more like ""a year in the life"" of Barnaby, and then just ends. I turned the last couple pages thinking ""Where is the rest of it?"" The only parts I liked were about the elderly who hired Rent-A-Back even though that was a little depressing. I don't recommend it."
1,Disappointing,"Anne Tyler does not do a good job of writing the voice of a 30 year old man. Barnaby Gaitlin's language is just not believable. The character of Sophia--please, what a cliche. Though she's a banker (why is she so broke?) her character is a stereotypical ""librarian"" or ""schoolmarm."" Though the story is set in two very colorful cities, Philadelphia and Baltimore, there is little atmosphere described. The ending is very ho-hum. I won't be rushing off to buy another Anne Tyler novel."
3,Too Slow and Blah ......Blah............Blah,"Patchwork Planet was my first Anne Tyler read. And I must say I was disappointed. The story was too slow. I found myself wondering when is she going to get to the meat of the story. It was just an everyday living of life story that just wasn't very interesting to me. All in all it was an ok novel, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Being generous,The only reason I am giving this book 2 stars is that I love Anne Tyler. This book was a disappointment.
4,Good book,"Seeing as how i was required to read this book for school, i assumed in the beginnning that it would NOT be one to enjoy. However, I was proven wrong. Patchwork Planet turned out to be a truly engrossing read, i believe the first one in a long time. congrats! i recommend this book to all! ~Catie, 9th grade."
4,Another Charming Eccentric,"Barnaby is yet another of life's lost, who Tyler brings into such clear focus. I love the way she brings out over the length of the story, all kinds of positive qualities about her characters that they don't know about themselves--having us both discover at the same time, for instance, that Barnaby is ""good looking"" almost at the end of the book. Sophia is very well drawn as well, presently herself as an almost impossibly understanding and mature character until you find out, of course, that she isn't at all.Barnaby knows a lot under the guise of not knowing anything, and serves as a reminder to readers that things most often aren't what they seem."
4,Takes Practice,Don't plan on cutting time off of your ironing until you have used this extensively. It takes a lot of practice but it's fun & I don't burn myself with it like I often times did with a conventional iron.
1,Read the small print,"The product description said fits all 12 cup Delonghi coffee makers.....NOT.I was going to return for an exchange, but the packing slip reads...coffe pot carafes are non-returnable. And, if it was, it would be subject to a $10 restocking fee plus shipping.... I pay to return ship an item that only cost $20.My bad!"
2,Review of DeLonghi coffee maker,"Though the coffee maker is handsome, it does not have a gold cup filter so needs paper filters. Often times, the paper folds over so that the coffee comes out weak. Also, the coffee maker does not have a tone to tell you when the coffee is done. And it is very slow brewing. I would not buy this item again."
3,Virgin no more,"Parthenius of Nicea is a minor author of the early Roman period, one of many Hellenistic/Roman Greek poets of whose work only fragments survive. He also prepared a number of summaries of romantic stories with tragic endings as a resource for other poets (specifically Cornelius Gallus) to work up into poems. Lightfoot has done a superb job of evaluating the data. At home with a number of methods, ranging from traditional philology to folk-lore, adept in judgment, thorough in analysis, complete in her survey of secondary literature. This is a major study that will stand for a good generation, if not longer. Parthenius is of interest to those who study Hellenistic Greek and Latin poetry and, because of his Erotika Pathemata, to students of ancient fiction. Lightfoot has served these disparate audiences well."
2,Extremely introductory,"If you already know basic HTML and CSS, this book is not for you. This is more like a pocketbook. It's vague without much explanation and just basic concepts. Only buy this book if you know absolutely nothing about HTML and CSS."
1,HTML,"Do not waste your effort, time and money.Deceptive and very vague. The author refers to chapters as hours the examples are vague at best. The continued use of incorrect wording is annoying.I gave this book a second try and came to same conclusion, this book have by a liberal democrap. Always lying."
4,Learn HTML Web Layouts and CSS Stylesheets in no time...,"This book is ideal for the beginner who wants to learn html and css as part of website layout and programming. This has assisted me in now editing my own website after initial programming throuhg an advnce programmer.The only problem with the Kindle version however is that the example code appear small on-screen and you need to look at these using ""Kindle for PC""In the Kindle version it's also a pitty that the code is in picture format, therefore you cannot copy and paste the code, but need to retype code."
3,"Mostly on overview, could have gone deeper in some chapters.","I was quite surprised with the numerous amounts of typo's in this book. I'm confused whether or not they actually did try out any of their code before putting it in the book. While I recognize it is very hard to include all necessary information in a technology book, but I think the author could have put more effort forth on some topics; I believe the layout of the book (the fact each chapter is an ""hour"") hurt the material more than helped. Overall, the book was okay. It provided a good overview, or at least a start to most subjects. One thing I did like a lot about this book was the amount of online resources it referenced to for further reading. If you are a beginner and really want to understand HTML I highly recommend the Head First Series book on HTML and CSS."
3,Good starter book on HTML,"As a novice in HTML and web design, I needed to start from somewhere. This Sams book on HTML gave me an idea what HTML is about. It is easy to read even though understanding HTML by reading one book once is only a baby step in the long journey of using HTML/CSS to create the well-designed web site. I plan to read it again."
3,Nice Pics. . . . .,"Unfortunately, This book is not your well known X-Files Guide book that we've all grown to Love. If you love Art, and meaning Freaky Art, then this is your book to own. But on a lighter note there are Scully, and Mulder pics. for your enjoyment. Fortunately for myself, I Love unique art, and X-Files is definitely covered under that category. I found it interesting to go into the minds of these very talented artists; to immerse myself into their subconsciously Talented works; In a way looking through their eyes at how they view The X-Files ((who knows, maybe even their own lives)). There are notes for each picture, and descriptions of what inspired the artist to Paint, draw, snap pollaroids or mold out of clay their creation. So if you're into Very Unique, yet captivating Art, then this is a Keeper. ""Hope Ya Likes!"""
1,Not for the faint of heart,Most of the art is compelling but repulsive at the same time. View only if you are a fan of the grotesque.
2,You can do better!,"I bought the Krona 1 1/2 quart double boiler because I needed a double boiler and I needed a small pot. Unfortunately this purchase was a big disappointment. While the bottom has the 18/10 stainless steel construction, the first food I prepared in it left its mark and I have not been able to remove them. (No, I did not burn the food nor cook on too high a heat). That aside, I can live with the bottom pot. The top one however, the double boiler part, is thin/very light and cheap feeling. Plus the pot has a conical shaped bottom which means you can't sit it down. How useless! If I had known, these latter two features would have been enough for me to have passed on this double boiler.Sorry in Alpharetta, GA"
5,Very pleased!,"I recommend buying from this seller, and I love this photographer of food! This is my second one, and I will collect these calendars for years to come!"
4,A fun book at a reasonable price.,"This is an enjoyable and fun book whether you only look at it or you actually prepare some of your own ""play"" food. Especially good for children, the ill, those who need to be encouraged to eat, or someone who is just feeling a bit down."
1,This is NOT the Kidneythieves!,"I got this disc because I thought it was the Kidneythieves that put out Trickster (a great album by the way). It's not. This is some kind of Matchbox 20 Lite version with not one of the people involved with Trickster (Bruce M. Somers and Free Dominguez). Needless to say, I'm disappointed. If you're looking for the Kidneythieves that did Trickster, stay away from this disc. I imagine there will be some kind of legal wranglings in the future stemming from this. They can't both be the Kidneythieves."
1,KT confusion,"Ok...regarding the whole confusion over the band names...the LA based Kidneythieves won because they were actually SIGNED to a label and I believe their name was copyrighted before the NJ kidneythieves. Regardless, the LA based won the court battle. =oP"
5,A must read for everybody,"This may be a life changing book. The rules are simple. Do not try the unusual to get ahead. Be extremely good at your work and follow the conventions of the workplace. Advancement most often takes time, is not a quick jump up the ladder by calling attention to yourself."
2,Weak clasps,"Earrings look great. Unfortunately, the star fell out of the clasps after one day. Resetting the stone was easy but annoying. This happened with both earrings, so be prepared to do some work yourself if you buy this product."
4,Book 3 of Lambert's Campbell Family Series....,"furthers strengthens the close-knit relationship between the siblings, Sandra (age 18), Josie (age 15), and Tenny (age 10). Josie is a high school senior at Wallaceville, Indiana, and one of the main characters in her senior play. The author Lambert does a very adept depiction of the difficult struggle that the main characters of opposite gender experience in portraying stage love, while trying to deal with real emotions between each other."
3,Mine was broken.,"Good rare stuff on here. However, be warned, my disc two is a reject that won't work in any of my players. I guess that's what you get when you pay so little money."
3,Ruined By Formulaic Writing,"This would have been a dynamite book had not the page count been limited to a mere 300 pages. Wizards of The Coast are known for keeping their page count to around 300 pages, and most of their writers do a good job portraying a good story in that word count. Strohm, however, fails in this, as his story seemed to have a lot more life to it before he pulled the plug. The 300 page formula makes him wrap up the climax in a paltry 20 pages, when it should and could have lasted 100 pages alone.The beginning and middle are good enough to merit 3 stars, so I guess its worth reading."
1,"Oh joy, 310 pages of knee dragging depression","I can't properly describe my level of disappointment with this book as it spends over 200 pages with the main character wading neck deep in personal sorrow. When you finally find out what this great tragedy was and look at the situation, it falls flatter that a wet bowl of oatmeal for justification of why the character feels so guilty or responsible.Close to the last part of the book after serial lock stepped sacrifices of the main and supporting characters, only four characters remain. Also the characters love interest that has been built up throughout the book is eliminated in less than three descriptive sentences and the main character barely even registers a care in the world.Stay with Paul Kidd and R A Salvatore if you want books of quality high adventure story telling.Keith Francis Strohm should try to keep his day job with pushing pokemon cards and not use his influence at Wizards just to simply get his book published."
5,You can almost hear the dice roll,"This is the first and only D&D book that fully captures the feeling of living a D&D module. The only thing I cannot fathom is why the Greyhawk series is so hard to find at most book stores. The inferior R.A. Salvatore books are everywhere. This book is very faithful to the D7D module yet still manages to tell it's own story. The dialog gets stiff at times and the plot ""twists"" are not very twisty, but the pace is snappy and you actually want to see what happens to the characters. The Forgotten Realms books are simply a series of battles."
1,Safety issue,I purchased this book for my son when he was about 9 months old. We both liked the book until one day he was playing with it in the car and got his little finger stuck between on of the shapes and the book. He screamed terribly and I had to find a place to pull over and release his finger. I haven't given him the book again.
4,Ken Russell meets mother of Frankenstein - worth seeing,"I saw this some twenty years ago, and haven't seen it since. It is a very particular vision of the famous night when Lord Byron, Percy Shelley and Mary Shelley spent a night in a country estate in Switzerland and decided to see who wrote the scariest story. Mary Shelley, of course, wrote Frankenstein out of that night. There are other movies on this subject - I think Roger Corman made one. Gothic is what one expects from Ken Russell - lurid, grotesque, hallucinatory, over the top. It hasn't been seen a lot since then, it hasn't become one of his classics, but it is a good film for those who like this sort of thing. And there is the addition of seeing the then young and upcoming English actors playing this - Natasha Richardson (as Mary Shelley), Gabriel Byrne (Lord Byron), Julian Sands (Percy Shelley), Timothy Spall. The scene that have stand most in my memory: Myriam Cyr's nipples turning into eyes."
4,"Strange, Hallucinogenic & Interesting","The movie ""Gothic"" is not nearly as awful as some reviewers here have represented. Russel more or less puts the viewer in the minds of the characters as they experience drug induced hallucinations and whip themselves into a climactic frenzy. If you can accept this frame of reference, you can enjoy the disjointedness and wierdness of this film. Both Byrne and Sands are excellent as the two poets, although Richardson is fairly wooden in her role. There is some poor editing, particularly towards the end, and some unexplained shots that require knowledge about the actual characters (especially Lord Byron). However, the film does a good job of conveying the goings-on of a crazy night at Byron's swiss chalet. In short, Gothic is a fairly wild (and short) ride that has to be approached with an open mind in order to enjoy."
5,Way off the wall and WOW!,"God, this movie is weird. (But I love it) Every time I watch it I understand something new about the symbolism that is everywhere in it. If you're looking for a reasonable attempt at unravelling unknown segments of history, look somewhere else. If you are looking for a wild ride that will make your pulse pound and make your little grey cells work harder, see this film: the first time I saw it I was still thinking about what it all meant for days."
1,Viewer's drunkeness may make this movie lucid or interesting,"This movie unconscionably wastes the ability of several fine actors. The script is negligible at best. No clear delineation is made whether this is a dreamscape or reality. Full of unexplained tangents that are often abandoned without explanation, this could have been a very interesting film. Even a hardcore Natasha Richardson or Gabriel Bryne fan will be hard pressed to watch this disaster more than once. RENT it and watch before wasting your money buying."
3,slapdash transfer,"I won't go into the pros or cons of the movie, which many other reviewers have covered earlier. If you like Ken Russell, can tolerate some ambiguity, and enjoy the darkness of Romantic poetry, you probably like this movie; if you don't, you won't.What I will mention is that Artisan has provided us with a DVD that defines ""lackluster."" There are no, repeat no, extras on the DVD. Not even an original trailer or still of an A sheet. The format is pan-and-scan, and I do not believe any attempt was made to restore the print. In fact, I would venture so far as to say this is simply the earlier VHS-formatted movie transferred directly onto DVD. If, like me, you no longer own or use a VCR, or your VHS version is worn out, this DVD is worthwhile. If not, then wait until someone who cares about movies, perhaps Anchor Bay, gets permission to produce this movie on DVD, and does it right."
3,Group Hysteria...,"Lord Byron (Gabriel Byrne) throws a bash like no other! Gathering his friends, including future author of Frankenstein, Mary Shelly (Natasha Richardson), Byron sets out to have a night of haunts and fear. Of course, true to the period, everyone gets blasted on laudanum (opium mixed w/ alcohol) and spends the evening in deepening states of hallucination and terror. Russell's never been my favorite director. However, he does know how to present narcosis on screen! As in ALTERED STATES, we are treated to many nightmarish images and a heavy, forboding atmosphere. While not particularly frightening or disturbing, GOTHIC has memorable sequences throughout, like the randy suit of armour, the thing in the coach, and the infamous ""look into my eyes!"" scene. Not bad..."
5,Twisted Cerebral Fun,"This movie is one I could wtch over and over - it inspired me to read the originalFrankenstein (Penguin Classics)(I had never read it until after I saw this movie), I will warn those who do not want to see nudity that there is some in this film but it is not gratuitous and does have a bearing on the story or character development. All the people mentioned in this film are real historical figures and alot of what is said about there lives outside of the main story line are actually true (no one knows if the events shown in the film took place - but I like to think that it did)"
4,A frightfully good time,"How's this for a premise: five people are trapped indoors during bad weather and decide to tell ghost stories as a way to relieve the boredom.Interesting, but rather dull. Now imagine that two of those pople are Lord Byron and Percy Shelley and the third is Mary Shelley. Now things become more intriguing.Ken Russell takes a look at one of the most famous gatherings in English Literature, and the results cause you to ask the question: Is fear an external or internal condition?"
1,"The CD was shipped promptly, but did not like the movie at all.",I should have known that if it was directed by Ken Russel it was going to be too strange for my tastes. He butchered the good name of Mary Shelley and the other characters. I was sorely disappointed.
2,Don't waste your money...,"Dr. Symon is basically a proponent of letting babies ""cry it out."" If you believe in the cry it out philosophy, then this book is just common sense. If you don't believe in crying it out, then you're not going to like what he has to say anyway."
5,Infallible guide to teaching your child or baby to sleep,"This book is great. Easy to read, common sense, and it works. I used it for teaching both my kids to sleep and they both slept through (8-10 hours) from about 8 weeks. Whenever they had relapses I returned to the book and they would be sleeping well again in a day or two.I have recommended it to about 14 other families in the past 4 years and it has worked for all of them. It helps you to understand how kids sleep, why they sometimes don't, and how to teach them this important skill. Buy it, try it (really try it, don't just dabble). It really does work. Well-rested kids are happy and healthy kids and have happy parents. Do your kids and yourself a favour and BUY THIS WONDERFUL BOOK!"
2,Infants should NOT be sleeping throught the night!,"a 9 week old sleeping through the night? Not likely. They have small stomachs and still need to eat frequently. I read a book that said that even 9 month olds still need to sometimes eat in the nighttime. Why is our society so eager to push independence in infants? They are only babies for a short while. Why do we want to rush that? Babies will sleep when they are ready to sleep. The only ""Sleep problems"" created our by these books that make parents feel that if their 3 week old is not sleeping 10 hours that they have created a monster! Babies were not designed to sleep all night. They need to eat!Even Adults can't always make it all night without a drink of water! Why the heck should we deny infants this?"
4,Good Review,"In This ValleyAftermath is a good review of what not to do when flying. As the office manager of a flight school, I have recommended to the manager that he include this book in the school's library and I am thinking of suggesting that the chief flight instructor consider making it required reading as some of the younger students do not understand why some things are repeated over and over and over."
2,Skip this one,"Bought a few years back at the suggestion of a friend. Might fit for someone with no exposure to Spirit yet maybe not even that. Writing is detached . Far better works like anything by Bradford Keeney and Shaman, Healer, Sage."
1,Don't order from here!,"I ordered this item on a Sunday, paid nearly $20 for 1-3 day shipping. The item shipped on a Monday, and I didn't receive it until the next Saturday! Costume is of poor quality, the hat is not as pictured, looks more like a witches hat than an Abraham Lincoln hat. Hat was actually compressed to fit in a package and the company should be ashamed for their lack of responsible shipping!!!!! I am returning ASAP."
3,it's okay for school project,"I bought it for the school project. The quality is not high, but for this price it's okay. However you've got to be a little bit more creative to help your child looks good in this costume. I had to find black pants and put the carton into the hat to keep its shape. The beard has 3 sticky tapes, but I also added a rubber band arond the head to keep the beard in case if tapes don't work. The cloak is pretty slim, so I would be recommending ordering it one size up. Besides, your child is needed to put on at least a tank top, because cloak's material leaves a little mess under it. Anyway, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
5,evolution of the earth by don prothero,"This book is gives you clear and concise knowledge of how evolution works. If anyone questions evolution, they will come out clearly understanding it after this book. It is full of pictures to help you understand the information. It is a clear journey through time"
5,So Handy!,This set of ramekins is so sturdy and a well rounded set for various kitchen uses. I use them for microwave cooking in a snap. Love them!
1,Piece of Junk,"Like some other reviewers have noted, this router is a piece of junk. I purchased one a few years ago, and it amazes me to see current reviews with the same problems I experienced then. Dropped packets, inability to maintain a VPN connection, browser timeouts.I was cleaning out my closet, and found this sucker. Thought that I might sell it on fleabay,(you get what you pay for). Hey, even on fleabay this sucker is not selling.I guess I feel better now, because this 2310 is now in my trash can. I could not have sold it on fleabay for 1c without remorse.Run away from this item, run Forest run."
1,Piece of junk,"It was easy to install and we thought it worked until a few days later, when we kept having to ""refresh"" it. Within a few weeks, I felt like I was using dial up again. In another week, one port stopped working, completely.Now, I find out I can't even get a full refund!Don't take a chance. You WILL be sorry!"
1,lockup router,"This router was purchased because of generally positive reviews. The installation was a little bumpy...had to call D Link support...but the call enabled me to get it running. Shortly after beginning to use the router, I noticed some hangup/lockup situations would occur. I wasn't sure if I was having issues with my ISP or the router or what. After a time braving the lockup issues, I searched the internet for lockup problems with the D Link router and found many people were having the same problem. I decided to replace the D Link router with a Linksys E1200 and the lockup problems vanished! I would not recommend the D Link router and, if it was not so much of a hassle, I would seek to return it."
1,Can't Filter by IP,"I wish I would have had read the reviews better, but you can't filter by IP address. I also noticed some weird timeouts so I'm thinking there is an issue with the routing too. Returning because I like to restrict access into my home network by IP. I can't believe this is not included!"
4,Works,"I gave it a four because it works and it installed easily.The included software will try and load a worthless ""network manger"" provided by a third party (only includes stuff Windows can already do and then gives pop ups to tell you to buy their complete package) The first part of the software disk will automatically sense your connections and get it going so you don't have to manually set it up.I just recommend don't bother with the last part of the set up disk which loads the third party software. Keep the disk though.. I had to re-run the first part of the set up again after I temporarily disconnected the router.I think it slows down sharing torrent files a little but I suppose its doing its job security wise."
1,JUNK!,I bought this product to replace a Linksys router that failed. The D-Link EBR 2310 keeps disconnecting from the cable modem every 5-10 minutes. D-Link knows about this problem and they can not fix it. Do not waste your money. I'm going back to a Linksys.
5,Great router for Computer and XBOX 360,I purchased this router to connect my XBox 360 and Computer to my cable internet. Haven't seen a loss of speed or disconnect yet and I'm usually on one or the other.
4,Excellent performance and price,"I was searching for a DSL router to replace my 10 years old router. Tried a Linksys and the setup didn't cannot find the router after initial settings.I'm glad I saw Debra's review on this model that the setup doesn't work. I ordered one and tried when I received it from Amazon and the setup indeed couldn't find the router.I just use IE to browse the default IP address and everything works like a charm. It even has a ""Continous on"" option for my PPPOE setup which the Linksys router lacks.It will get my 5 starts if the setup works."
2,cant do anything,"it's a solid router, but i use it for my ps3 and pc, and when i do multiple things on my pc like download music and use firefox, it almost picks one to work with and the other wont work...for example, if im on firefox and start to download music, firefox wont load anything"
1,Resets constantly,"The router will not maintain a connection. Turned off UPnP per website recommendation, didn't work. Reset speed on computer and router to absolute 10mbps per website recommendation, still didn't work. Hours of tweaking settings to try and maintain connection. Uninstalled antivirus, still won't hold a connection for more than 5 minutes at a time. Router continually resets itself when using internet in our small 3 computer office. Waste of time and money."
1,Constantly drops connections,"This router is completely useless as a router. It drops connections constantly. You have to wait some indeterminate amount of time until it comes back. At least power cycling work restarts it. In addition, since one of the reasons it drops connections is bw overload, it will overload with at extremely small data rates it is useless when trying to use the 2310 as a router for multiple machines."
1,Junk -- don't buy it.,"Very poor performance, This router was (until I replaced it with decent hardware) a bottleneck in between my home network and broadband connection -- when multiple users were sharing the connection, they got extremely poor connection speeds. Tech support was very unhelpful, and could neither diagnose nor fix the problem. It's certainly cheap, but in this case, that's because it's poorly made junk. Spend $5 more somewhere else, or you will be very disappointed."
2,"Inexpensive, Average performance, poor reliability",I bought this two years ago and it's been going out on me for six months now. the switch in is must be bad because constant dropped connections and slow web page loading is occurring. 1.5 years is a sad amount of time for a lifespan in my opinion. I bought a new router and hope it lasts longer than this model and brand.
2,drops connections all the time,"I used this router at home for two years, servicing a Macbook, a Linux box, and occasionally my Windows laptop from work. Throughout that time, I had flaky internet connectivity, which I always attributed to my ISP, Comcast. Recently I became suspicious that the modem might be responsible, and found a number of reviews from people who had traced similar issues to the router. I took my router out of the way, used an Apple Airport instead, and the unreliable connectivity went away immediately.Some people in this product page seem to have had no issues, but look around here, and in search engines, and you will see a sizable number of people with flaky connections because of the router. It may be some manufacturing tolerance issue, or some conditions may set it off, who knows. But I'd avoid altogether."
1,Stopped working after one month,"This product worked perfectly fine for one month, then stopped working. I called D-Link customer support three times and they were unable to fix the product. They told me that they do not offer refunds but that I could ship the product back to D-Link at MY expense and they would try to fix it and then ship it back to me. If you're looking for a router, I would Definitely avoid this one and I would recommend buying any router (or similar cheaply manufactured technology product prone to have problems) from a physical store so that you can easily return it if you encounter problems in the future."
2,Works fine - then fails,"This little router worked fine for the first 7 months of service. However, it then began to disconnect and the diagnostics said the ethernet cable was not connected (it was). It would restart and then disconnect about every 2 hours. I gave up and bought a linksys and things are back to normal. A router should last longer than 7 months."
1,Just doesn't work very well...,"I connected the router to one computer - and it worked perfectly.I connected a second computer and the internet connection to both became very slow, disconnecting multiple times, even when only one was being actively used.I could share a printer through the router, but not the internet connection.Online tech service is a joke.Documentation is not helpful.Try a different brand."
4,Easy setup,"It worked fine as I setup and it worked fine, but it cannot take an input of 220V to be used in India. So I had to return it."
5,Excellent (so far).,I've owned it for several months now and I've not had any issues with it whatsoever.The CD setup program is most helpful (although not needed) as well.I did own a previous D-link that died but it was in nonstop use for a few years so I can't complain. We'll see how this one does.
1,Don't buy it unless you live in Alaska,"This router has an amazing thermosensor inside it. If you use it to transfer data continuously, e.g. watching netflix stream video, you are good to go in winter but not other seasons. Today I unplugged it twice in order to put it in my refrigerator for about 10 minutes only to use it for another 10 minutes to 1 hour.So if you live in Alaska (or anywhere cold enough all year around) and do not use room heater, this might be a good one for you."
5,D-Link Router,"Work as advertised. Good price and delivery. Had Linksys for over 5 years, but finally it gave up. D-link had better overall customer reviews compared to Linksys. Followed direction and easy setup. Been operational for over a month with no problems. Recommended."
5,Novice user but got it up and running in ~ 1/2 hr.,"This may not be a glowing recommendation but consider the source, a novice. :} Being as this was the first time I ever set up a router I'd say it went pretty well. Yeah, I had to try a couple times, and it did take a good 20-30 minutes (mostly not doing anything, waiting for things to be detected), yeah, it was a little bit frustrating when it seemed like I had done everything right only to have it not work...the first time, but when I ran the software again and did all asked again, all the same way, it worked fine. So...though I was a bit frustrated with the setup, in the end it did work fine without me having to call tech support and, me being such a novice I'm satisfied with the overall results."
1,NOT for Mac users who are new to broadband routers!,"The included CR-ROM manual has a nifty ""Setup Wizard"" which sadly is not compatible with Macs, which I discovered only after buying this thing and then calling D-Link's Tech Support hotline. I talked to the guy for an hour trying to get the basic configuration behind me, only to have him tell me that I needed to call my ISP (surprise!) because it's their fault that it wouldn't configure properly. And I'm certain my ISP will tell me it's D-Link's problem. Not only that, but you also can't download firmware updates on for this router on a Mac.I'm returning this and doing what I should have done in the first place - getting face-to-face advice from a good local electronics store."
5,Ethernet router/switch performs flawlessly,"I had a problem with WiFi penetration with 802.11g in my old house with thick walls of plaster over metal lath, so I hooked two Mac desktops to this router, hooked the router to my DSL modem, and hooked my Apple Airport Express to the router. The Airport Express (for laptop access) required reconfiguration to get all the IP addresses compatible, and one call to D-Link's excellent and helpful tech support got me configured; now the system works fast and flawlessly."
3,Slightly confusing!,"Well, actually the router is not that confusing. But just attempting to get the computers to network together is confusing.The router is small, a bit smaller than a paperback book. Hooks up very easy. It has a cd that is supposed to help get everything co-ordinated and working correctly. The disc actually did not help me when I connected the router to the computers. I was on the net in about 3 minutes, but still (3 weeks later) am having trouble getting the computers to talk to each other. Computer #1 is an older Dell Dimension running XP, Computer #2 is a newer Dell XPS Studio running Vista. neither computer wants to speak to the other, and I cannot get the XP computer to access the Vista machine so I can use the printer.Would I buy this router again? Maybe, but the price on this one was just so right. At least the net works (pretty fast too)!"
2,Wired Router,"Setup was a breeze...but unless you are a computer programmer, the online user website (that you have to use to access your administrative menu) is useless and impossible to read and understand. If you are looking for something with easy setup then this is it. But...if anything goes wrong and you need to change sttings then GOOD LUCK. I am pretty computer literate and can usually find my way thru most programs, but this one is waaaaaay beyond my expertice. For now it does what it is supposed to do and at a good price, but I would like to have found one that was more user friendly."
2,it works but won't let you configure it,"I bought this when I set up my home network. The CD included told me that I didn't have an EBR-2310 when I tried to load it. hmmm That's what's printed on the router. Oh well.. I was on the internet anyway so who cared? I DID! When I tried to get into the router page I kept getting an error telling me that the page wouldn't load over and over. Since I use my computers for gaming, this router couldn't handle the traffic and port forwarding couldn't be accessed. Tech support was no help. They told me to buy a different router. Seriously! So, I will."
5,Excellent bassic Router,"This is a basic wired router that simply does what it says it will do. The set up simply could not have been easier. Very user friendly. It is half the size, compared to other brands, which allows it to fit nicely into any configuration. Silver and black color scheme blends with most equipment."
5,Great router,I've had it for a month and it works great.I have 3 computers hooked up to it.It was very easy to install and inexpensive.Don't forget to put disc in before installing router.
4,It works,"Well unsurprisingly it works, works exactly as it says. It does not have a cable input, it is basically an adapter for a cable modem that only supports one pc. This way you get a network that works good for a good price. I will say that the only drawback is that the Network Magic software that it comes with is a trial, but as of now I don't see the necessity for my home network. So D-Link does it again in my book!"
5,Great home router,It set up in just a few minutes and came with enough firewall and networking software to provide a rock solid expansion of home computing/internet connectability. It's cheap and even looks nice.
1,D-Link EBR-2310,"This router is very fast once you are connected to a web site. It's three times faster downloading than our older LinkSys router. And, it seems to stay connected even for large downloads.But, it fails to connect to new sites. Surfing from site to site it connects about half the time, usually timing out. Family members complain to me every day, this is a home system. We went back to our old router because of this problem.Please read the postings from other users on D-Links own web site. There have been problems like this reported for the last year and no input from D-Link. Firmware version 2.01, there is nothing newer on the site."
1,Bad service,"I am not happy with your return service. I made mistake ordering wired Router while I need wireless one, but the seller refused to return the router or replace it with wireless one.Khaled M DadeshPhone:313-384-8262"
2,ROUTER DISCONNECT,"D-LINK ETHERNET BROADBAND ROUTER EBR-2310. THE PROBLEM IS ONE OF RECURRING DISCONNECTS, REGARDLESS OF 5 TECH SUPPORT CALLS IN 3 DAYS WITH AGENTS WHO ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, TRY HARD, BUT ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT SOLUTION - NONE OF WHICH WORK - EVEN WHEN THE CASE IS ELEVATED TO SOMEONE HIGHER UP. THIS ROUTER WAS PURCHASED AFTER A PREVIOUS D-LINK I-604 MODEL ""DIED"". THAT DIAGNOSIS WAS MADE BY PAID TECH D-LINK SUPPORT (ANOTHER COMPANY) WHEN I BEGAN TO HAVE RECURRING DISCONNECTS. THE MOST ANNOYING THING ABOUT D-LINK WARRANTY TECH SUPPORT IS THAT ONE HAS TO LISTEN TO THE SAME VERY VERY LONG SERIES OF MESSAGES - EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING THAT THEY LIST TO TRY.I AM RETURNING THIS ITEM AND PURCHASING A DIFFERENT COMPANY'S ROUTER IN THE HOPES OF MORE COMPETENT AND UNDERSTANDABLE TECH SUPPORT (IF NEEDED) AND A BETTER PIECE OF HARDWARE."
1,Save your money,"Reading the other reviews it sounded like a good product. I tried useing the c.d. to install it. Didn't work. Tried to manually install it. Didn't work. called tech support. Wasted 2 hours,finally they said would mail me a replacement. 10 days later replacement arrived. Repeated my past actions and AGAIN it FAILED. I give up. How one party says its great and another says it stinks. Must be the router. Good Luck"
1,Couldn't give it any lower...,"The price was as good as I could find and normally I don't believe in ""you get what you pay for"" kind of thinking. But in this case... Buggy as heck and eventually couldn't get it to do anything at all. Refund received though-thanks."
4,"So far, so good",It arrived on time and worked as anticipated--after I got the wires plugged into the right ports! No problems so far.
1,Excellent Frisby!,"This Router is a very old design, and in 2012, it is crap. I think it came out in like 2004, so it's a antique, and it performs like one, but It does make a excellent Frisby."
1,regularly drops connections,"It goes through periods of dropped connections. Very unpredictable. In our case it often happens in the evening. You'd think it's the cable modem for sure with the traffic being heavier in the evening. I've done troubleshooting and NO it's the ROUTER. I'm actually typing this while connected directly to the cable modem and bypassing the D-Link router. Why in the evening? Maybe there is more traffic on our home network or we just notice it more. I'm looking for another router. Not D-Link. This is the second time it happens to me with a D-Link router. The first time I thought it just got old and decided to replace it, because the setup is just fine.Now having read more reviews I see that about half the people who bought it have the same problem.How it got a ranking of 3.5 stars with 1/4 of the people giving it one star is a mystery to me (40 out of 152)???"
1,Very bad router,I got it last week. The internet connection drops every 2-3 mins. You should not buy this cheap product. I am returning it back.
1,"DO NOT BUY.. NEW IN BOX, STILL FAILING","THis product is perhaps the most horrible thing I've bought from Amazon, and especially from DLink. I googled this router before buying, and the internet is FULL of issues about it, but for the low price, I figured I would take my chances. MISTAKE. Router works for 5mins, then fails. Reset, it will work for 5mins, then fail. Firmware is up-to-date. Other routers on same connection do not duplicate this issue. THIS PRODUCT IS FAULTY. No one on the Dlink forums can offer a fix, other than ""buy a different router"", and Dlink is not addressing the issue at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID, PLEASE!"
3,Supports very limited number of sessions !,"After buying the EBR-2310 I noticed that my internet connection would become sporadically unavailable. After some troubleshooting I discovered that I am reaching session limit when I visit websites that don't support HTTP Keep-Alives.Basically, such websites require a separate connection to receive each element of webpages, including images and such. Each of the connections is stored in router's internal memory for few minutes and it doesn't take much to overrun the routers session table capacity.Other than that it works fine, but I recommend you look at a different router if you're an active Internet user."
1,Don't bother,Ordered this to replace an ancient (circa 2004) Netgear router. Lasted approx. two weeks and then died. Now I cannot even log in to it to figure out what is going on. Guess I will have to live with wireless and buy Netgear again.Save your money.
4,Solid American Death Metal,"No Reply was the first full-length album from North Carolina's own Daylight Dies. The band sound merged elements of melodic death metal in the vein of bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquility, with Katatonia and My Dying Bride style doom. They are one of the few American bands that manage to play this kind of music well.No Reply is powerful, melodic, and brutal...just what you expect from death metal. It's also melancholy and heavy enough to appeal to doom fans. If you're a fan of In Flames, Dark Tranquility, Katatonia, Anathema, and similar bands, you'll want to see what Daylight Dies has to offer, and No Reply is a great place to start. I think you will be pleasantly surprised."
5,Best death metal band in US,"If you are a death metal fan you cannot pass this album up. It is a very powerful and emotional journey from beginning to end. Drums, guitar work and vocals all blend together to create this epic work. I strongly urge you to get a hold of it. Also check out their website at http://www.daylightdies.com and view the video of 4 corners if you want a taste of their music."
4,E otimo!,"I've looked for many books to study independently Brazilian Portuguese. I've found that many geared for the tourist don't help someone who really wants to learn the language. Brasil lingua e cultura offers enough grammar and vocabulary for a person to learn Brazilian Portuguese on their own. Another text I have is for Spanish speakers but I find that the vocab is not arranged in any thematic manner which renders studying less interesting and practical. I'm no expert so I can't judge whether or not the cultural information given is correct; but I can tell you that if you are looking for a text to learn Brazilian Portuguese, this is one of the better options available."
1,"Poorly written, full of grammar mistakes, stereotypes Brazil","I am only familiar with the first edition of ""Brasil, LÃ­ngua e Cultura"". Based on my experience, the book is poorly written and should not be recommended to readers. In an attempt to present ""colloquial Brazilian speech"", the book features non-standard language that would be unacceptable in educated speech or writing. The grammar explanations are also seriously flawed. Finally, the book stereotypes Brazil and Brazilian culture and includes many offensive and politically incorrect remarks directed at the country and its people."
3,"AH, c'mon...it's not THAT bad....","Yes, it's lacking in some features (it has a poor glossary and some confusing grammer rules), but the bit about it being offensive? I don't think so. Brazilians have a very dry and open sense of humor, and that is what this book portrays. It is written primarily as a college text book for the college age group, and therefore the little cultural side stories (mostly about college life) written into the ""text book"" format is actually quite entertaining. It's a lot better then a lot of other Portuguese text books out there, trust me!"
3,Addendum to My First Review,"Brasil!: LÃ­ngua e Cultura is probably one of the better Portuguese textbooks on the market despite some of the aesthetic problems that I mentioned earlier. It should be noted that ALL textbooks have some errors or other minor ""burps"". I would like to again reiterate that the Lingua Text personnel were always very helpful."
1,Errata!,"Highly suspect!!! I used to be a devotee of Thieme, too. Then I discovered that God is love. Then I discovered that Thieme distorts interpretation to align with his own personal beliefs -- errata! Not kosher. Not fair! A distortion of grammar and syntax. Even Chester McCalley, who is now with the Lord, did not agree with him in this respect. Life is sacred! Not R.B. Thieme, Jr."
4,vision for the layman,"A very concise description of visual skills, aimed at the practitioner who needs to be able to easily explain visual functioning to parents and laymen. It has lots of good intervention suggestions and accommodations and modifications for those with visual deficits."
2,does not work,"Same problem as many others--new batteries--worked 2-3 times then stopped. Reloaded batteries and still nothing. My brother has the original green handed bank and it still works fine. This one never ""rocked"" like it was suppose to either. I would like to get a replacement that works, if possible. My 6 yr old son loves the old version his Uncle has but was very disappointed in this one.Magic Bank"
1,Could be a fun item,"I had one of these when I was younger, many years ago and it worked fine.Mine was DOA (dead on arrival). I thought I could possibly fix it but oneon the motor connections was broken off. Really made cheaply like so manythings these days. Buyer beware, you may be fortunate and get one that worksbut for how long? They can be a fun toy, maybe some other company will startmaking one that is a better quality."
1,Absolute Junk !!!!!!,"Product totally failed to work. Poor quality. Don't waste your money because it will end up in the garbage. Schylling should be ashamed for selling such crap! The only thing magic about this bank is how it makes your real money disappear. . . .poor, poor, poor !!!!!!"
1,Did not work for me!,"I got this for my dad because he is a banker. He took it out of the box, tried a couple sets of batteries, and it wouldnt work at all. We left a coin between the two metal strips and after a while the coin became very hot, which tells me it was defective."
1,very disappointing,"When I received this bank, I put batteries in it and it worked good. I wrapped it up and gave it to my son for his birthday. It worked a few times, then quit. I thought maybe the batteries were bad. I replaced them and tried again. NOTHING!! I wiggled it, shook it and it worked again. Later that day, it quit working. It seems as though I have to really mess with it to get it to work. It is a cute idea, but too unpredictable."
2,Fun for 30 minutes,"I bought this bank for my daughter. It only would accept think coins, no dimes. Then it stopped working after 30 minutes. Would have been great if it worked right."
2,Funny idea. Poor execution.,"The hand only grabs the coin about half the time, and the box is so constructed that getting those few back out is almost impossible. Not the Addams Family the way it used to be..."
3,Magic Bank Surprise,"This was a 2009 Xmas gift for my almost-5 year old grandson. He loved it and put lots of coins in it the first day. However, I haven't seen him handle this toy/bank since."
3,Grandpa's Bank,My husband's grandfather had a bank like this. I waited 35 years to get mine. I keep the bank on the coffee table and a roll of pennies in the drawer and my own grandchildren get a chance to play. I think a child would break this in a hurry if they are not careful but at my house it's a treat and they watch and learn.35 years ago the hand was green and that was really cool. This is still fun however and I have purchased another as a gift. At least now I know whose hand is grabbing my pennies.
3,Fun gimmick,"I had this when I was a kid so I bought 4 for my family. 1 out of 4 worked. TnT Toys was FANTASTIC - the president responded less than an hour after I emailed and said he would personally test each one before sending 3 replacements. He sent them priority and they arrived in time for Christmas. They are all a bit temperamental and sometimes require a good shake to work. If full of coins the motor runs quite loudly, so it's mainly a neat gimmick to watch a few times. Also very hard to get the money out - grab the top while the hand is snatching the coin."
2,"fun, but unreliable","this toy is great fun with a surprise element that makes people laugh. unfortunately, it works sometimes, but not others. we can't seem to make it work every time, and need to fiddle with it to make it work."
4,Magic Hand,"Simply Awesome. Very good toy, specialy in this times wich video games rules. Not saying that video games are`nt grat, but, real interaction happens only with real toys."
1,I am returning mine...doesn't work...,"Our old one broke so I got this for my husband. However, the hand doesn't come out and the motor doesn't turn off. Very poorly made."
3,Magic Bank Toy,"This is a nostalgic toy that my kids had when they were little, and my husband loved it, so I bought it for him for Christmas. He still loves it."
3,"Not bad, but drags at times","There is definitley a lot of thought provoking material in Lopez's book, like the placement of wolves in folklore, fables, and mythology, but at times it drags on in lenghly explanations and reads to much like a textbook."
5,Incredibly informative and readable!,"One of my earliest memories is reading Jack London's ""Call of the Wild"". Ever since then I have been fascinated by dogs and wolves. Barry Lopez has done the wolf and the reader a great service with the extensive research. He does an amazing job of not crusading for the wolf and because of this the book is that much more persuasive. I've always felt that wolves lived their lives similarly to the way that men probably should live their lives. Anyone who has any interest in wolves, or man's relationship with the wild should pick this book up immediately."
2,Not a hardcover book,I can't comment on the content of this book because I gave it as a gift but it is a paperback book not hardcover despite claims to the contrary in the description of it.
4,Everything you could want to know about the wolf,"This book was ahead of its time in pulling together the most comprehensive, cohesive argument on behalf of wolves that had appeared at the time. By marrying folk wisdom, science, mythology and the views of practical utilitarians for whom the wolf impacts their way of life, Lopez has created a more complete picture of this wonderful species than any other that I've ever seen to this day.I felt more at home when Lopez was citing scientific biological information rather than spiritual texts, but appreciated everything. Lopez has a clean and precise writing style that will bring wolves to life. I also enjoyed the way that Lopez shines the spotlight on the ugliness of hunting wolves for sport.A great book; I recommend it for all those who appreciate the great outdoors."
5,"Fantastic trip-hop debut, perfect for those late nights...","This is not Portishead or Fiona Apple or anything else. Daughter Darling has a sound all its own, and in that sense they are phenomenal. Yes, this album will fall under the broad category of ""trip-hop"" and as that it is very good. If you want a sort of ""heir"" to Portishead's empty throne, well, this is about as close as you can get, though I think it's unfair to compare anyone to the absolute perfection that was Portishead. Natalie Walker has a delicious voice, unique and warm and fantastic, and for the most part, the tunes and beats are great, extremely well-put-together. This is great late-night listening. C'mon, support an up-and-coming act. Get this phenomenal CD!"
5,One of the single best,"Trip Hop albums I have ever heard. Sweet, ethereal vocals laced with haunting melodies and great downtempo beats that are so important to the genre.This album is a must for true Trip Hop fans and if you pick it up you will not be disappointed. I sat, waiting in sweet anticipation of this album for half a year and it certainly did not disappoint. The replay value is markedly high and I am anxiously awaiting the 2nd album.It is certainly refreshing to hear a band such as Daughter Darling come on to the scene and I expect to listen to them for years to come."
4,Quick P.S.,"The first track on Sweet Shadows, Broken Bridge, was also used in the first episode of Bones, Season One - that's how I heard of it, though it took some internet research to track down Daughter Darling - glad I did!"
2,Beauty between boredom,"2 1/2At first DD can come across as just another goth-y, female-fronted outfit with lackluster beat-driven influence, but SS heads into a middle stride to showcase some production versatility and strong vocals, making the process rise above bearable."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!,"My family are big fans of The Globe Trekker series in general. The DVDs are normally high quality, with crisp picture, good sound, and the best travel hosts in the world. This is why this DVD was such an amazing disappointment. The DVD quality was extremely poor, with garbled sound and a less than crisp picture. It had the look and feel of a DVD that someone illegally copied and tried to sell on the street. Shame on Amazon for even advertising this DVD on its website and shame on Globe Trekker for putting out such a poor product. The host was fine and the stories were interesting, but the entire experience was ruined by the low quality of the DVD itself. Also, this is not one of Globe Trekker's more recent episodes. It's time to go back and redo this episode!"
5,Parts of My Brain,Parts of My Brain is popular with both the adults and the pre-teens in our house. It seems to feed that quirky twitch we are genetically pre-disposed to!
3,most plans were weird looking!,There were a few really good plans. I really liked the color images. They helped me to really visualize what the house would look like. It would have been helpful if there were more color images. Also maybe some inside views of the home.
4,Home Plans,Gift to someone looking to build a new home...they liked the book and said it was helpful and gave them some new ideas for their home.
5,Good children's book!,"Lots of nice photos, good animal atlas book. Kids in class enjoyed it, with plenty of facts. Kids can draw pictures from the photos here. A good gift."
1,Ick,No thank you there are a few other seasonings out there that taste much much better.Sorry just not for me.
1,"This Product Includes Salt, Black Pepper, and Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)","No wonder they don't include the ingredients in the ad. MSG has been shown to cause health problems and is entirely unnecessary from a health and taste standpoint. I never would have bought this product if I had known. Foolishly I ate some and had heartburn. I immediately tossed it, feeling really ripped off for my money. Come now, Amazon -- shouldn't you make it mandatory to include a full rundown on ingredients on products such as this? Think about it."
1,Tastes Great! Then it nearly kills you.,"A friend cooked up some burgers using Cavender's. I commented that the burgers tasted great, and they really did. Then at 3:30 am I broke out in some of the worst hives I have ever had. I had thought I might have an MSG allergy, now I am positive. Thank goodness for a massive dose benedryl or it may have killed me."
4,can't live without this,"i have been using this seasoning for many years, which i first bought in a specialty store and then had to buy it direct from the manufacturer. now that it is available only from amazon, i am not happy to have to buy 12 8 oz shakers. that would last me 10-15 years. i will give some away as gifts, but some people refuse it because of the msg. nontheless, it is a wonderful seasoning and i use it for salads, meats and vegetables cooked in the oven with just a little olive oil and cavenders."
2,Filler from Bruce Brown,"These are 3 short segments that are filler compared to Brown's other surf movies. If you are going to buy it, purchase it along with the 7 others in The Ultimate Summer Bruce Brown Surf Collection. Not worth it as a stand alone. (Just wanted to get a real review posted since the first one is so bad! IMHO of course!)"
3,Like a box of clippings in the attic.,"This was published in 1984.There is some interesting information in this book. It's deceptive and confusing, because you'll be reading a clearly factual list and the next list will be opinion.The writer even includes himself in a list of greatest rock critics. Perhaps this is done with a wink?Because public opinion changes, it's interesting to stumble upon lists (soft rock, for example) that a contemporary critic might approach with a more open mind.Fun, like an old box from the attic. Certainly dated. Nice if you like trash and treasure."
3,high and dry,"a good, even compulsive read, and a stark, moving portrayal of immigrant life in california. but the white rich people are over-the-top, really caricatured in their greed and self-involvement, in their lack of understanding of the issues they apparently care about (the environment, open communities, fairness, human decency). boyle has done much better in other books (for instance Friend of the Earth). at the end, what you get is a series of stereotypes, which is not necessarily bad, but certainly not the stuff of good literature. it will leave your mouth dry and bitter, just like after one of those big california fires..."
4,2 worlds in one place,I really thought the ethics and morals of this book are understanding. The bias that exist in society are seen on the pages of this book. An Anglo-American family and a Mexican family are destined to meet in a small city of California. They keep running into eachother throughout the book as the story twists and turns. I think this book is a good read!
3,"Brutally honest, but not highly enjoyable.","The Tortilla Curtain is a tragic account of brutal honesty. It made me really question my morals and how if I actually abide by them. It is difficult to read such honesty and sometimes it is even engaging. However Tortilla Curtain was not engaging for me. I found myself skipping the chapters about the Mossbachers and reading the story of the Rincons, for the simple reason that the Mossbachers had nothing to offer me, and the Rincons had an actual story.The book was not an enjoyable, engaging read, but I am glad I read it and found I had more questions to ask of human nature and people's motives after I read the story."
2,Not at all impressed,"I recently read this book for a book club. I found it trite and terribly predictable - and, ready made for a TV movie or series. So, a couple from Mexico cross the border illegally, she becomes pregnant, he is beaten up, they live in the canyons, they get robbed, she gets raped, they get robbed again, she has a baby, the baby is blind, they set fire to the canyon, they find a safe haven, then the mud slides hit....what was left out?Why do people read this and think it is good? And, why should people feel guilty if they have a job and raise a family?Did not like the book or what it implied."
1,the downtrodden vs the unhappy whining haves,"Everything negative that could befall an illegal mexican immigrant happens to this couple. It's one after another knock down. After a few of these, I wondered why I was reading this depressing mess. The woman gets raped and gives birth to a blind child. The man saves up money for an apartment only to have it lost to him time after time. The rich white folks are the worst kind of self absorbed, whining americans. People I don't want to spend time with- including the hours reading a book about them. I can read about these issues in factual stories. I don't need to pollute my fiction reading time with this."
5,Human Nature,"The Tortilla Curtain is a gripping read about the flawed and yet redeemable human nature. Stylistically, it is written well and captures all the nuances of fine literature. T.C. Boyle swiftly captures political undertones without telling us the message of the book. He does not tell us the point but shows us. Though the ending at first is unexpected, unsatisfying, and a let down, I realized that if the ending was written otherwise, it would have been a lie and just another fiction novel with no truth in it. Though portions of the illegal immigrants' lives seem a bit exaggerated, it gives us a perspective into their lives and our lives and the mental stereotypes that trudge back and forth between both races, resulting in racial tension and misunderstanding."
3,Interesting Story about real problems,"The novel deals with immigration and racism which are important and actual topics. It's about by two main characters named Delaney, a nature writer who moved to Aruyo Blanco with his wife Kyra and an illegal mexican immigrant named Candido with his wife America. At the beginning they meet in a car accident and from there on they are somehow connected. The story alternates between their different point of views so it's quite interesting to read. The most impressing part is the development of Delaney from a liberal humanist to a racist just because of a few incidents with mexicans which influenced him badly.In the end the protagonists face each other and a mudslide carries them away so there is no actual showdown or happy end.I think the novel is worth reading because it gives a good impression of the problems ,which an immigrant has to encounter, and how they are treated by the people who already live there."
3,"Intriguing, dark look at society","The extremes of the reach for the ""American Dream"" are both depicted in this novel. I found the stereotypical, new-age American family to be quite disturbing, and equally so the abundant struggles of the illegal aliens. The twists and turns of the plot and the interactions of the characters kept me interested for the most part. I would recommend it to those who wish to see a different point of view of how the so-called ""American Dream"" affects those who believe they already have it and those who wish to attain it. It requires an open mind."
3,Over and over: Problems/Catastrophies,"Boyle's intention of writing Tortilla Curtain is very intesting.He shows the contrast between the American upper class and illegal immigrants. His main topic is racism and the inner personal conflicts concerning this. One of the main characters for example, Delaney, wants to be a fair liberal humainst but fails.Becasue of the structure Boyle chose, it is impossible for the reader to identify with either of the characters. Due to this you develop an objective point of view. This is positive.Although he did a good job reaching his goal it wasn't a fun book to read. Because of it's many exaggeratins, problems and hopeless situations the book seemed dramatic, sad, unreal and therefore untrustworthy. The reader's hope vanishes and there is not even a happy ending :("
2,book club read,I would not have chosen this book had I known that is was about racism. I do not like this kind of book
2,just dreadfull,"i really thought that this book was poorly written, it had a bad view on the mexican ways. it made me feel anger, sadness, embarrasment, and just plain sorryness towards the author. i hope he has writttne better books than this one."
3,My words,I really did think this book should of been better. I really didn't get into it at all. My opinion does matter. Boring is the only word I can come up with.
1,HORRIBLY INACCURATE,"I can not begin to describe my disgust with this novel. The way he sets out this farfetched situations just surprises me. He describes immigrants as ignorant people, who are always running. Makes them seem like some kind of animal, I 've seen more respect given in describing a dog."
1,Biased and Slanted,"This book is worthless. Don't waste your time or money. If you want a biased, slanted, bleeding heart view of illegal alien squatters who are invading our country, just pick up the LA Times editorial section. I've heard this author is not willing to debate this book with those who are fighting to save our country against this invasion. Is he afraid of being exposed? It seems T.C. Boyle is desperately trying to make a buck off this issue. Remember he wrote this book in 1996. Forget this piece of junk and go for an honest account of the illegal alien invasion with any books by Lou Dobbs, Tom Tancredo, or Jim Gilchrist."
2,"lacked depth, has been done before better","I consider myself a T.C. Boyle fan, and T.C. Boyle to be one of our best living writers. But this book struck me as so heavy-handed and even poorly written that I could not get through it. John Nichols covered much the same territory in ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" and the rest of the ""Magic Journey"" trilogy, but with more compassion for his characters, more depth and more control of his craft.Is this really the same author who wrote ""World's End"" and ""Water Music""? What sort of contractual obligation was he under when he wrote this?"
4,I couldn't put it down.,"Yes, it was depressing, but it also was very enlightening to the fear and mistrust on both sides. The ending was a surprise, but there really isn't an ending for this problem in the near future.The character development was excellent and I felt I knew each one personally.I would definitely recommend this book!"
4,absolutely great,"The novel is not only entertainment but makes you think about problems of misunderstanding, intolerance and prejudices between the Americans and the illegal immigrants. Because of the shifting point of view the reader is able to identify with both couples and doesn't take side. Boyle managed to write an interesting novel about a very important topic. Besides this book isn't as boring as most of the books you read in school. You can also read it a second time and you will still discover more and more allusions and details. We can only recommand it because you don't waste your time by reading it!"
3,The Tortilla Curtain,"This novel is worth reading because it revolves around the timely issue of illegal immigration. The characters are rather flat and one-dimensional, and the book ""jumps the shark"" a few times, but it is interesting to view the problem from all the different POV's. Our book club read it and had a lively discussion, but more about politics than about literary aspects of the book."
2,"Weak, a writer in love with himself","Disappointing, political correctness run amuck, another writer thinking he's God's gift to the world and small-minded enough to lance people who it is fashionable to lance, and praise people of a minority skin color. Utterly predictable, a peon to stereotypes and one-dimensional characters"
2,I Listened to this book,"for what seemed like weeks! I can hardly believe it could be ""abridged""; Boyle said everything he had to say at least three times anyway. And then, it just stopped. Very poor ending.Started out interesting, but just went on and on and on with nothing happening with the exception of the occasional natural disaster. We got the point real early. Illegal immigrants are good, just want work and are treated like dirt. Yuppies are self-serving, materialistic, greedy, etc. And furthermore, their efforts to ""protect"" themselves are pointless anyway. Look what happened to the wall and the gate...It got really boring..."
1,just depressing...,"There are certain books that are depressing in a powerful way, in a way that's thought-provoking and interesting. I found this to be just a collection of every depressing thing that could happen to both illegal immigrants and middle-class residents of Southern California as a result of illegal immigration. I felt no sympathy for either couple after reading this book, and it seemed like the author was trying to hard to make it sound well written."
2,"Present conflict, but too lengthy","The book ""Tortilla Curtain"" deals with an interesting conflict between immigrants and upper middle class-Americans, but it is written in a boring way, because there are too many details and the story is too long. It has no real climax or structure and because of that, the story seems to be endless. Another aspect is that the plot is exaggerated and surrealistic, although the depiction of two completely different worlds is very good.All in all it is difficult for the reader to see the whole context, because of too many unimportant details."
1,It never came. I double check the shipping address and it was exactly correct.,It never came. I double check the shipping address and it was exactly correct.
4,A story that makes you examine your own feelings,This story kept me thinking and I also found that my feelings about the subject (illegal immigrants in Southern California) kept changing throughout the story -- as they do for several of the characters. It paints the issue in different lights and tells the story from the views of various characters involved. It really does show you that there are more than 2 sides to every story. Most importantly I believe it teaches or at least reminds us to be empathetic to others who may not be as fortunate as we are.
4,Battles,"It's the illegal aliens vs the too wealthy nouveau-rich. A perfectly drawn picture of each side certainly showing the human side of each, both good and bad characteristics. Each person really came alive for me. I knew them, even the minor roles. Certainly a graphic description of both tiers of society, their problems and their successes. A learning experience getting to know people with whom most of us will probably never have any contact. An absorbing read."
3,The Tortilla Curtain,"A fairly well-written book. It illustrates a lot of good points--the irrational way that racism creeps in and takes over a mind, the negative and positive of Mexican immigrant. For me, mostly, it put an individual face on a problem that we think of as more of a collective."
2,Hopeless and lost,"One criterion that I have for what is a good read is whether I like or empathize with any of the characters. This story falls down in that area. Each character is almost unrelentingly selfish, desperate, unhappy and without hope or prospect of future happiness--with the possible exception of America--and it is somewhat unrealistic that she stayed with Candido after even the first of their series of misfortunes.The story gets lost and does not quite know how to end--without revealing the ending, I might say that it is unbelievable, unsatisfactory (and feels unfinished).Despite good descriptive passages, I would not recommend it."
1,Utter crap!!,I had to read this book for a class dealing with other cultures and I hated reading every single page. I don't see how this book relates in any realistic way to the class I took. Every stereotype you can think of was played out to the extreme and it made the story unbelieveable. The writing is just horrible. The author takes entirely too long to get to the point. You could take out all the unneccessary crap and it might make a decent short story. Don't waste your time or money!
2,Not that great,This story while somewhat interesting was a bit contrived. I would not really recommend this one.
1,This book is terrible!,Americans are supposed to feel guilty for the illegal aliens that have come to America illegally? The white people are the ugly awful characters of this book. Whoever TC Boyle is~ he thinks a lot differently then I do!
5,Used Book,"I ordered the used book, ""The Tortilla Curtain"", from Amazon.com. It came in excellent condition, and the price was unbeatable! 1 cent + $3.99 for shipping!!! I would do this again in a heartbeat!"
2,Thought provokingly depressing,"I hated reading this book. The suffering that America and Candido endured and the lengths they went to in order to survive were just too much. There are truths in every part of it but the fact that everything bad that could could possibly go wrong did, after awhile served to almost desensitize me to their plight. And, of course,the yuppie couple with their materialistic problems were so despicably insensitive they were just as hard to take. I am sure the author went to such extremes to make an important point. There has been some change in the treatment of immigrants by the state of CA since this book was written and it would be nice to think that this book was a catalyst for change. If you feel you need a reminder on what constitutes moral behavior and what does not, then read this book. That to me is the only reason to read it...it is just too painful from beginning to end."
2,did not care for this at all,I had a tug of war with this book. At times I liked it and then really disliked it in the next few pages. the characters were way over the top stereotypical and unbelievable. I live/work in California and am in the thick of this issue. I won't spoil it but the ending was awful. I'm glad it was a library book and I didn't pay for it.
4,Good book but Amazon should make it clearer what you're buying,"I had heard that Tortilla Curtain was an excellent book which would make one think. It was and it did. I was, however, less than pleased with Amazon. When I went to order the book, the first choice listed was a paperback. I wanted a hardback so I ordered the other choice. When it arrived, I was much surprised to see that it was an audio book. Being an old fart, I had never even heard of audio books and I certainly didn't want one. So, I threw the ridiculous thing straight into the garbage and went to the library where I checked out Tortilla Curtain. I highly recommend the library as an alternative to Amazon."
3,gripping,"First I have to say I am not an expert on illegal immigration, and do not live in California, so I don't know if this is true or not. I do have family in the area, and tend to think it's on the true side. Whatever the case it's worth the read because it was gripping. The bad part is that the ending was abrupt. There was no closure, and I am disappointed. I was into the charaters and now don't really know what happened to any of them. There's a vague clue, but no closure....It's still a good book, great for a discussion. Maybe great for students too....just to start debates....I found myself pulling for the immigrants, simply because everyone wants a better life. Aren't we all products of immigrants, one generation or another? I understand we're getting alot, and it's taxing our systems, etc...but doesn't everyone deserve a chance ?"
3,reading two books at the same time..,"Tortilla Curtain is the story of two men living in two different worlds.Delenay Mossbacher - a white American citizen with a regular family lifeand CÃ¡ndido RincÃ³n - an illegal Mexican immigrant who wants to start a better life with his wife in the USA.The story of the Mexican CÃ¡ndido is quite interesting told and you get information about illegal immigrants in an exciting way. It is full of cruel, but also realistic, events happening to the couple.By contrast, the Mossbachers seem to be a very ordinary family. These parts are so boring that I was on the verge of skipping it sometimes.While reading the book I was always wondering when they would meet again. I actually thought the lifes of the two protagonists were connected much more. That was the most disappointing aspect of the novel. It was more like reading two books at the same time."
3,Better Than Most Current Fiction But...,"I heard about the hub-bub over fellow Santa Barbarian T.C. Boyle. I picked up the book and was a bit disappointed. Perhaps the premise just didn't grab me. The writing style is ok, but not particularly deep or fluid."
1,Penguin over priced,Penguin sets the price for e-book editions higher than paperback editions. Not buying it. There is ample content at reasonable prices.
2,"Good idea, but lack of plot","This book was good about teaching to ignore racial differences and such, but that was about it. I never really got the plot until I was through 75% of the book. This book is way too slow moving."
3,What does it all really say?,"Although the details were vivid, the book's ending was very sudden with an unnecessary twist. It was never clear to me whether author was trying to show the hard times imigrants are put through in The Land of Opportunity, which seems to be owned by assimilated white Irish descendants that have lost all ties to their past culture. Or perhaps Boyle is against illegal immigration, discouraging it by making it look very unpleasant. Perhaps, he even discourages American aid to illegal immigrants. Hence the phrase ""don't feed the coyotes"" often spoken by the liberal main character, Delaney. It seems to me that the coyotes are the illegal immigrants. The book shows that they come uninvited and expect to be welcomed, and the plan fails them."
3,"Wanted to know the outcome, but not exactly a compelling read","Rather depressing, but interesting to see how parallel lives with the difference being affluence and poverty along with illegal status makes all the difference when life happens. I recommend reading the book. It is thought provoking and an easy read."
4,A good read dealing with contemporary Americana,"This book was assigned as part of my ""contemporary American Literature"" class. At first I thought it would be some liberal propaganda for more lenient immigration laws or something along those lines. There is a Mexican couple that lives in the canyons of an L.A. suburb trying to buy into the ""American dream"" (without really becoming American). We are also introduced to an affluent white couple living a gated community. This is a great fictitious work dealing with socio-economic and class inequalities, racism, segregation, etc. The contrasts in this book are at times comical and sometimes very tragic. Boyle has a unique stlye and isn't too academic or dry."
3,Great premise but a very poor ending..,"It starts off being interesting but by the last couple of chapters, it becomes absurd and you regret having purchased it."
3,I want a better ending!,I like endings where all turns out okay and I am informed of it. I felt it still left me hanging in mid air. I liked all the references to the area as I live nearby.
5,Tortilla Curtain enligthens and challenges,"I read this book because area high school students are being required to read it and I had heard varying opinions. The story reflects what I believe to be the reality for many who cross our borders. It shows the desire and commitment of the human heart.At the same time, I believe, it shows a defensive nature that goes unnoticed in so many people. Some find it easy to cry over the loss of their pets while failing to see the pain inflicted on human beings. Is not the need of a human being greater than that of an animal?In the end, the victim reaches out a hand to the victimizer ... a true lesson in compassion.hman"
4,Should be required reading for all California schools!,"Not only is this book entertaining, it is also a chronicledtragedy of what happens to immigrants who come to Californiaunprepared and illegally as well as a tale of the loss ofhumanity of those who inhabit the ""upper class ghettos"".Chapter after chapter you are left to think ""what else couldhappen to these people?""Read this book, you'll find it fascinating whether you live in California or not!"
3,Boyle unfairly stacks the deck,"TC Boyle is a sharp-eyed , capable writer (though I was driven crazy by this American's constant use of the Briticism ""round"" -- as in, ""he looked round and saw...""). He keeps the plot moving, but the book would have been much more interesting if Delaney had been a real human being. Instead he's a puny whiner whose fussy complacency is underscored by a constant listing of his name-brand accoutrements -- his Lexus and his Goretex and his Vibram soles with half-inch tread. I wearied of him fast, and of Kyra and the rest of the Arroyo Blanco crowd instantly.How much more deep and searching an exploration of the burning issue of illegal immigration Boyle could have offered us, if Candido's opposite had been allowed to be a full-hearted, open-minded man of intelligence and conscience, instead of a silly, shallow , selfish straw man? There's not a sympathetic gringo in the entire book."
2,"Dry and Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive repetitive.","The Tortilla Curtain, although describes in uncanny detail the horrifying yet practical racism Mexicans and foreigners experience in the United States of America, is still not very good. It continues to portray the same message over and over in a thousand different ways at least 50 different times.It's dry because there is only so much that can happen to illegal immigrants in the USA. Despite the repetitiveness of the book it still contains a great message that really opens up the eyes of an everyday American like myself. The book shows how brutal people can be to other humans because they talk a different language and have slightly darker skin . This would, could, should be a great novel but it is just spread out 200 pages too long.Unfortunately the message the story extrudes from the writing is not enough to weigh out the fact that it's dry and repetitive, repetitive, repetitive."
3,True but boring book.,"A lot of what was written in this book is truth. As in how Mexican live here in the United States to survive, it is true. Immigrants come here to have a better life. As for the people that already live here and were born here tend not to care. I'm not saying everyone but most people don't care. In this book there is a lot of truth but the book was not exciting at all. This book is about how two different couples and how they both deal with life differently, all the different things they both go through. There are parts when you think the book will get good, which it is, but then it just goes back to the boring. To some people it might be a very good book because it opens your mind to many other things and realize how cruel people can be. That's might be but there is not excitement. All i am saying that if you want to read a book about facts than read Tortilla Curtain. If you want a book with more excitement than grab another book."
2,Opportunistic,"The potential to execute a work of high intellegence with this subject matter in this day and age is limitless. However, dispite the fact that these ethnically-oriented 'tragic' realism plot lines are in ample supply, TC fails at offering us with any new direction. His unwillingness to assert ANY position on this theme speaks to his inability to create any new or original perspective on this bordering-on-tiring literary genre. He merely capitalizes on the popularity of such works and gets away with cranking out the same old Same Old."
2,"Keep It Simple, Stupid","Mr. Boyle preserves the classical unities in appearance, but underneath, it's an MTV video, bopping here, bopping there. He gives us flashes of insight into a character, then long reams of cardboard. **** Like GOW, this book strives to portray the tragic immigration situation. But Boyle is cleverer than that. This cleverness works in bits and spurts, so TC is not as preachy as GOW. But it distracts the reader and detracts from the story. When I finished this, I felt a moral emptiness, not in the LA Mr. Boyle describes, but in the story itself. *** This would have been much better as a shorter, leaner book. Even so, it's not awful - the prose is, at times, beautiful - and the characters are interesting. Plus, the hardback version I bought (for $6 at a used book store, so don't feel too sorry for me) has a lovely cover."
4,Highlights the Human Factor in illegal Immigration,A must read for anyone who has an opinion about illegal immigration. This book is sensitive to both sides of the issue rather then casting judgment it paints illegal immigrants as humans and lets the reader decide what their opinion should be. Bravo!
3,"Ah, the writing...","Boyle knocks out a great read that [...] me into the storyline - pronto. But his ending is lacking in depth and it is only within the fnal page or two that he attempts to reward his readers for their efforts. Hard to knock this guy and his writing abilities, but he's got Steven King-itis since his endings are sometimes (but not always) lacking. This puts me in the odd situation of saying that I'd probably not recommend this title to a friend, but I'd be willing to tackle his next book when it hits the shelves."
4,No Jack Steinbeck... But damn Boyle is good. One of the best around today.,"This book of the Mexican experience of trying to get into the US for a stab at the American Dream is a gut wrenching, miner in the hole, canary dead, run for the light story. His confidence in telling the story is what hooks you here. His characters -- the ones you will look for next time you are in southern California and they whiz by in their Lexus with the air on high going from point A to B passed those who are taking the heat for the rest of us. No, it's not a bleeding heart yarn here, but rather something that leaves the reader to decide what exactly is wrong with this picture."
5,i give it 10 stars!,"I'm surprised at how few 5 star reviews there are for this book. i read this book in high school and was one of the few out of all my classmates who didn't hate it. Very touching and moving, very real, believable characters, with rateable and real-life situations. The contrasting point of views are very effective and evoke empathy and understanding for both sets of couples. Wonderful novel."
2,The Tortilla Curtain,"If the author was going to take on the issue of illegal immigration, then he should have taken it on fully and more robustly. The story is weak and cliche'. The character development of both the Mexicans and Americans is narrow minded and doesn't show the broader spectrum of people in this country or of those that come across the border. I have recommended to my book club not to waste their time on this book. Frankly, for someone unemployed, I'm angry I even spent money on this book."
5,Immigration is there; like it or not,"With the new immigration laws being considered, this would be a great book to get back in touch with the reality of immigrant life and what it is like at the human level."
5,The Sitwells Are Back,"Reading T.C. Boyle is always a pleasure. Delaney and Kyra Mossbacher's pets are named after the Sitwells (English writers): the terriers - Sir Osbert and Sir Scheverell Sitwell; the Siamese cat - Dame Edith Sitwell. Very clever, Mr. Boyle."
3,This novel lacks something.,"The Tortilla Curtain lacks something. It lacks that universal equilibrium found in humanity. In moments of great distress, humanity finds a way to create a balance in the shape of hope, humor, transcendence... It is a survival mechanism. The problem is not that the lives of the characters in Tortilla are extremely depressing; in reality, they could be even more depressing than Boyle's depiction. Life hardships and circumstances are not what strip Boyle's characters of humanity. Mr. Boyle himself takes care of that. There is almost a patronizing disdain in a way this story is told. A happy story is not worth reading nor writing. So what's so great about a sad story?"
2,It just makes me mad ...,"... when Boyle goes to such lengths to create complex characters and then, for deadline's sake or waning interest, turns them (especially Delaney) into stereotypes by the book's abrupt end. And the ending is just Boyle washing his hands of the whole business. Bah!--don't waste your money for this cheat of a novel."
5,satirical brilliance,"I love this book, and read it before moving to Southern CA. It made me decide not to have children, and that was the right decision given life in SoCal. I have assigned it to creative writing students who find it heartbreaking and true. The best satire builds compassion for all those trapped in society's self-deception and false promise, and this is it."
1,Could he have added one more disaster???,I was so dissapointed in this book. The characters were all completely stereotypic and uninteresting. There were so many disasters that befell the hapless Mexican couple that it was hard to take after awhile. The premise was an interesting one but was VERY poorly executed.
1,"Boring, boring, boring.","Holy cow, what a worthless and boring read. Did Boyle actually do any research on this? It amazes me how certain writers can just sit down, fabricate lies, and then draw a royalty check. And with a writing style that could put the sleeping pill industry out of business."
1,The Tortilla Curtain,This book is a WASTE of time and is an attempt to undermine the American culture. I would advise that NO ONE read this book! I wish I had not but I did want to determine its value and I conclude it is a no buy - no read book.
3,The Tortilla Curtain,"I received the book a little bit later than I expected. Also, it was a bit more worn that I expected. However, the price was very good."
4,This story stays with you.,"I read this novel in a day. I liked it, though I never knew who to root for, I never knew who was a hero. This would have been a 10, but the ending was a let down. It seemed the author just wanted to wrap things up."
3,No joy here,"I read this for my book group and everyone else in the group loved it. I didnt, but not because it is not beautifully written, it certainly is. I just dont want to be sad and uncomfortable and in a dark place for the amount of time that it took to read it. There is no joy in this book. Not a single character experiences happiness for anymore than a couple of lines and then is thrown back down to the bottom of the misery barrel. Not for me thanks, I'm too old."
4,when to worlds crush...,"The Tortilla Curtain is about dreams of a better life, problems of illegal emigration and predjudices.T.C. Boyle tells two stories - one of a typical white american middleclass family, Delany and Kyra Mossbacher with their son and their two dogs and the other, about two poor mexicans that illegally crossed the border to live a better life in the promised land - and he lets them cross each others way.The story is settled in California, near the mexican border.Beacause of an accident Candido and Delany come in contact first, afterwards their ways cross several times again.The development of prejudices towards the emmigrants, their problems to exist in the new world, that doesn't behaves as the promised land should - very realistic and immagineable."
3,Good fences do not make good neighbors,"As someone who works with undocumented aliens and immigration (from an advocacy point of view), I would hope that the issues raised by the author were already sufficiently known that they could be presented less melodramatically than the author did. But, if one has never thought much about issues of immigration and its connection to American culture before, the book will provide an interesting and occasionally moving introduction to the subject. You could, however, watch the movie ""El Norte"" and have the same thoughts provoked, and more profound questions raised.Finally, the snap ending ...was it meant to be Maupassant or was it just a gimmick? I think it was the latter."
3,"Straight, forward & to the point. Full & broadbased.",Good Job. Mr. DeMey has put together a source book that does credit to its title. Due diligence is the key to hiring a good & honest person. This source is valuable to any business owner or Human Resource Manager.
2,Renaissance was better than this....,"In purchasing this CD, I was anticipating music that reflects the excitement that was the Renaissance. Instead, I felt I was listening to middle age dirges. I confess, I've not listened to the CD again."
5,captivating,"It was a very well written book.,I couldn't seem to put the book down,,,the characters were people I could identify with..."
2,Nothing in common with Orthodox Judaism,"This English only Bible has nothing in common with Orthodox nor any other orthodox Judaism. It includes the New Testament, which is not a part of the Orthodox nor non-orthodox Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). It is the King James Version of the Bible slightly modernized and filled with popular Hebrew and Yiddish words.Its Goble's translation is more less as accurate, compact, and concise as the King James Version, and still old fashioned. The Hebrew and Yiddish words used there are popular and easy to understand especially for readers of the Ashkenazi decent. Their meaning is quite easy to decipher, so other readers should not have difficulties to read it at no time.This 4th edition has the same content on 1232 pages, as all previous editions, but is smaller at 8.4 x 5.3 x 1.6 inch and difficult to read. The larger 3rd edition (ISBN: 0939341050) measuring 10 x 7 x 2 inch has already small print even though the letters are bigger by 20 % than in this 4th edition."
4,Unique Translation,"Goble's translation of the Bible is unique in the world of Bible translations. Unlike David Stern's Complete Jewish Bible, Goble's translation is loaded with Yinglish (Yiddish and English vocabulary).It appears as though Goble translated it for the very religious Ashkenazi segment of the Jewish population. This translation will not appeal to all (Messianic Jews included), but for those with the prerequisite background it should prove to be welcome addition to anyone's collection."
5,Insightful Read,Great translation that brings the New Testament into the language of the modern yeshiva. Very insighful into the Jewish practices of the early believers.
1,The very name of the work is false.,"The author is a Christian and his book is merely a Christian translation with a few Yiddish words tossed in for effect. It's certainly not Jewish, let alone ""Orthodox Jewish"". How can there be any merit in something founded on falsehood?"
2,I thought this was a sppof until I saw people actually take it seriously.,"I actually thought this was a spoof -- somebody decided to take a Tanach and render it in yeshivish, and then went ahead to do the same to the xtian bible. I am kind of horrified that this is actually marketed as a legitimate ""Jewish Bible,"" or that it represents Judaism at all as a reference or study text -- to me, it is really just a tongue-in-cheek, Jews making fun of Jews sort of thing. Again, this is not a bible -- it is a parody of a bible. You will find this hilarious if you're a Torah literate Jew, and if not, it is a misleading product that will surely lead to misunderstanding."
4,Interesting & Useful,I am glad I got a copy of this Bible. I really like it. I've been studying Hebrew so it makes sense to me. If you have no understantding of the Hebrew language this Bible will be confusing. I have only one complaint. I wish it had been printed in hardback or leather in a larger size with larger font. Then it would be the Bible I would use most. The font is very small.
4,Perfect for the use,"This little gadget is perfect for my use. Always on the boat, ready to be used to check my 12v battery status before leaving or when returning. Quick to use and I like to have both a rought idea of the charge as well as the voltage.Few pointers justifying only 4stars from what could have been a perfect score:The wire is a bit short and needs to be stretched on a large battery. Not a big deal but one more inch would have been perfectThe voltage indication is a bit off compare to the color reading. The meter indicates 100% for 13v which is incorrect. Most battery, depending on the exact density, should be 100% around 12.7_12.8v. At 12.8v, the meter gives 2/3 charge. Not big deal, just need to know that you have more juice than the meter indicates... Better that wayFor reference (I have the table printed and taped to the battery)[...]All of these picky comments for a great price, so let's be real. It is a great product."
1,This bag won't 'EVERLAST',"Simply put, the bottom areas where the bag chords tie up to it get ripped open due to the constant pull of using as you go to the gym or anywhere else. The cloth around begins to rip and you are left looking for another bag, eventually. This probably lasted me a year..but not forever.."
2,a Nicaraguan View,"The book is quite disappointing in that it does not provide the same type of information about each of the different trees listed and as a tool for deciding what types of trees to plant at our home in Nicaragua it only occasionally provides useful information. In only some cases and they are sporadic it doesn't indicate normal height and branch spread, accommodation to wet and dry areas or seasons, when it flowers, normal longevity, compatibility or incompatibility with other foliage or trees, resistance to disease /infestation, sun shade preferred conditions, etc. In short it was not a source of information for appropriate selections."
3,Gives a general Idea,"This book gives a general idea about the subject matter. Though the author's remark indicates that it is specially designed for the Civil Engineering PE exam, I find it just an average review book, not complete"
5,Great Mystery!,"Another great ""Mac Mystery""! I could not put this book down until I finished it. A great story that kept me guessing ""who done it"" until the very end. I would highly recommend this book!"
1,Don't waste money,"I have been reading this book, trying to hang in there, but seriously? Just some fact checking: The autopsy said that the guy was shot, hitting lung and aorta (although external exam was repeatedly ""unremarkable""). Then, they go out to the waterfalls and want to throw a sheep off them to rule out suicide or an accidental fall? Before or after the gunshot that, per ME, killed the guy? Does no-one read these books before they are published?The plot is just not very exciting. Lots of fro and back about this detective who can't make up his mind which woman he wants, too many details during the autopsy and about this eccentric looking female ME, ... it's just dragging along.Now, this book goes back on the shelf and out the door asap ..."
4,Parallelism,"This book contain intriguing arguments regarding possible connections between major historical events such as the rise and transformation of political regimes. In a unique way, the author addresses the differences between paternalistic and fraternalistic regimes and establishes a hypotheses concerning similarities between such diverse regimes as ancient Macedonia, revolutionary France, Nazi Germany, and revolutionary Iran.The most interesting section of the book deals with the detailed analysis of the Iranian revolutionary system. There, the author describes in a clear manner the array of political figures in Iranian politics since the fall of the Shah, as well as the political and ideological struggles which have taken place between them. Additionally, the book contains some predictions about what the future may hold if there are indeed parallel processes at work. All in all, the book is a quick, yet thought-provoking read."
4,This book rocks!,"Liked this book, I think it's too cool. Much more than your average comic. Saw brian at the small press expo in california and really dig his work."
1,This movie is NOT hands of steel,"I had order this movie and got other movie, not Hands of steel (AKA) as you can read from DVD description. So beware - if you order this, you will get ""Fugitive lovers"" by John Carr, and even if you ask them to resend correct title, you will get same DVD."
1,Shame on Large Music!,"This mixCD was supposed to be one of the best I have in my collection, the choice of music is excellentBUT I gave it back to the shop I bought it from! Reason: the whole CD is recorded in MONO !This is a real shame, and moreover Large music doesn't even bother answering me when I questioned them if they knew this CD was FULLY MONO and so what went wrong during the mastering.I wanted to buy the vinyl edition instead, but that isn't available :-(shame shame shame, should have had 5 outta 5, now it is worth 1 outta 5"
2,Widescreen disappointment,"I was looking forward to a widescreen version, but it seems this is NOT on the dvd even though its referred to in the Amazon blurb."
3,THIS TIME THE TEAM WREAKS CHAOS IN THE FORIEGN LEGION,This basic Abbott and Costello comedy is a fast paced adventure about Abbott and Costello as wrestling promoters. When I first watched this I thought it wouldn't be as funny as the teams other outings but then I was wrong. I noticed that Abbott and Costello do the same old same old though but never the less the team does pull through.BEWARE WATCH OUTFor the teams most funniest routines.
5,Absolutely the Best!,"I must say that this is just amazing. The sets, dialog, atmosphere, and more... This movie is just about the best i have ever seen. Lionel Atwill and the others are fabulous. I love old horror and murder mysteries and this movie does it all. The only thing is, please try to get your copy of this movie in its orig technicolor as it is much better to see than in black and white. It makes the sets and feel of the movie much better. Thanks Norm, it was your review that led me to this movie ! P.S. I agree, Night Monster is another great movie! I love it!"
3,"Not one of the best, but worth a view","Length:: 5:00 MinsI'm partial to Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Mummy from this time period, but ""Doctor X"" is certainly worth a view. See my video for more info about the picture."
2,boring,"As a foreign living in Turkey I can say that this book is one of the most boring ones dealing with Turkey. The writer makes a few mistakes in the book, he claims, for example, that Kurdish language is banned in Turkey. The book seems to be written in 1993. Kurdish wasn't banned then anymore. Yes, Kurdish language has been banned, but not during this decade and it is not banned anymore. In Istanbul Kurdish language study books are being sold at bookstores and one can hear Kurdish being spoken every day. For me, this was very surprising, totally the opposite what Western media says. Anyhow, the book also made a few stupid generalisations about Turkish women. The book was fairly naive and shows that the writer has a very scarce knowledge on any Meditarrenean culture. I must admit that I do not think that it reflects the reality of Turkey at all. It is totally from another planet than the Turkey I live in."
3,3 1/2 Stars for a Light Read,"I have never been to Turkey, i may never go either. But, i found this book in my new home and decided to read it. I had no expectations. And it turned out to be a nice read. It's the kind of book you pick up and read when youre hitting the sack, or just lying around the house.The author brings you through several different parts of Turkey and gives you a glimpse of what the culture is like. It is a very personal account of his trip through the country, and i always find things like that pretty interesting.I recommend it, if you can find it for free, hidden away in a house youve just moved into."
3,Turkey Demystified,"This is a very personal account of the author's travels around the different regions of Turkey. I think his introspections are interesting. And, he does make places like Ankara, Ephesus and Bodrum more intriguing without over-selling them. For an outsider, I think this book does very well in showing what one might encounter when travelling in Turkey. Although, it should not be deemed as a general description of how Turkey is really like. I like the tidbits of politics and history incorporated into the chapters. It made me learn some things about the country."
4,"workhorse, quality prints",I have 2 of these printers for our offices. They are both workhorses and churn out 1000 pages at a time with ease. I buy the toner for a good deal ... so they are very inexpensive to use. They work fine on my server/network. They are a little noisy but that doesn't seem to bother anyone here.
3,Average storyline with enhaged sex scenes,"A nice 'semi-erotic' movie with a story that make you want to see the end of the movie. A erotic-movie maker is being accused for killing one of his a acctress, and tries to show that he didn't.Very nice erotic scenes."
4,Without the Art Where's the Story,"This is the very first adult illustrated novel I've ever purchased, and I'd say Plucker was a great step towards buying more in this particular genre. It's haunting imagery goes well with the tone of the story. The story itself plays out quickly with interesting characters. The only problem I had with the book was the fact that without the pictures, a lot of what's happening would be lost in the reader's mind. Perhaps this is common with illustrated novels. I wouldn't know. It just bothered me on those occasions when something was broadly described and I had to stop and look again at the painting or drawing to see exactly what it was the author was trying to describe. Still, though, this book is a fine effort from Brom, and for fans of his art style (dark, moody, and strange), you won't be disappointed."
3,Nice art work...,"...but the tale's a bit childish, too predictable and full of stereotypes. Brom's a skillful artist and his efforts in writing are praiseworthy, but making a story worth of adult attention requires a little more inventiveness. I must add is far from my intentions to critic the book from a grammatical or linguistic perspective (I don't speak english -sure you've noticed already!), but I'm able to judge the content as an average reader."
3,The Plucker,"I bought this book for my 17 year old son. 17 year old boys have strange tastes - and this is something that he asked for. I ended up reading the book for a couple of reason. The kid asked me to and the illustrations in the book, though odd at times, were wonderful. Brom is a wonderful artist.The story is on the dark side that involves an old African myth that is woven into a contempory story. There's the good guy, the bad guys, a bumbler, a pretty girl, someone who rises to the moment.I ended up liking the book much more than I anticipated. I don't usually read such dark stories but I know that if the kid asks for another book from Brom, I will probably will read it. Good vs evil stories are always good - and there is a good moral to the story - whether that was the author's intent or not. I recommend it - the kid gave it 5 stars - he really liked it - and it is now being passed around among his friends."
5,The Plucker: Brom,"Excellent delivery and packaging as well as pricing. Super customer service when needed. Overall, meets 100% quest satisfaction!"
1,VERY WEAK STORY SO SO ART,"I was excited to find this book because I am a fan of fantasy art and story. Unfortunately, the story is very weak and did not have a lot of substance. I needed the illustrations or I would have been lost. And even with the illustrations, the story is not very good. The story is a VERY lame take on Disney's TOY STORY."
1,"Repellent and Ugly, Not For Young Kids","Although Brom is a talented artist, this is a disgusting story that should never have seen the light of day. I'm sorry to think that kids are going to be exposed to this ugly, repellent stuff. Brom may think it's a riot -- after all, he has a photo on his web site of his own small son giving the finger to the viewer. But his sense of the macabre and his own peculiar humor is an indigestible mix, at least to some of us. Maybe he's spent too much time talking to Tim Burton. He should stick to illustrating other people's stories and characters."
4,Not My Favorite of Brom's Work,I brought this becasue it was such a good price and I love Brom's artwork. I would say start with Devil's Rose and then read Child Thief next. This is my least favorite of his works but I will say it's worth reading.
4,5th Grade and up? That's surprising...,"In the above School Library Journal editorial review it says that this book is for grades 5 and up. I don't want to sound uptight, but I am surprised at this determination. I love dark, stories with beautiful drawings like this one. But I wouldn't say that it is for everyone. I would caution parents that are looking at this for their kid who likes Nightmare Before Christmas. My mother was a librarian for most of my life and I am very open minded to books and how they shape our lives. If you are considering this book for your child, may I suggest that you go to your local library or bookstore and take a look at it first."
2,Disappointing...,The artwork was amazing and I thought the concept of such a storybook was awesome and creative and exciting. The story and writing was a complete let down. Couldn't even finish it. Maybe the movie will be better.
2,"A pretty, but empty, box.","While Brom certainly has an abundance of skill as an illustrator, he hasn't developed his storytelling ability as far as he should have before penning this piece. The artwork doesn't fail to capture my imagination, but the writing is weak, the premise shallow and the attempts to shock fail. I'm not unhappy with the purchase, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this volume for its literary content. Brom should keep painting, but leave the semantics to someone else."
4,Harlan County History,Loved sharing this book with the family. Worth buying if you or your family grew up or had family that grew up in Harlan. It was great seeing some familiar family names and seeing how they came to be in one big family.
3,Good cd from one of the greatest comtemporary samba masters,"I liked this cd especially the first six songs. Really good rhythms and arrangements, however the last couple of songs fall flat a little and takes away from the overall quality of the cd."
3,"Good quality, but not enough exposures","The picture quality for these cameras is great. The biggest bummer is that it has so few exposures. When you go to get them developed, you have to pay as much as you would for a full 24 or 36 exposures. I would recommend buying a disposable camera with more exposures."
4,Great Purchase,"I bought a few of these wedding packs for my brothers wedding and was more than pleased with the results. Unlike the other reviewer our pictures came out great, indoor and outdoor shots. We were able to pass these out to various people at the ceremony and reception and got a wide range of great pictures. The benefit is that you don't have to bug everyone to send you their pictures of the wedding. I just gathered the cameras up at the end and got them developed. Now I'm thinking I'll buy a few of these for future parties, great product."
5,Wedding Cameras,This was a great product for the price. My reception was dimly lit but the pictures still came out fine. I would definately buy this product again for another formal affair.
1,DO NOT USE FOR YOU WEDDING ! you will regret it !,"its a fine product except for the fact that the flash needs to be turned on by flicking a switch, located on the front side of the camera body. Which means you are going to have a lot of underexposed interior shots, but nice outdoor shots..when the general public uses this camera for the first time. Learn from my mistake and buy kodak or whoever has an automatic flash that charges and sets itself when you hit the button to snap a picture."
1,Too good to be true,I tried this product on a lark. I thought that for 39.95 it wouldn't be a big risk. It worked fair for about two weeks and quit working. The remote only worked for about a day. I thought perhaps the battery was bad but hadn't yet gotten around to changing it until the whole unit died. The main unit itself gets super hot when plugged in and is perhaps the reason this unit failed. I couldn't recommend this product to anyone.
3,"Works, but hard to install.","I'm a programmer and this thing is hard to get working, plus has a crazy way to hook up the sound. No fun but does work with a lot of effort. Not for noobs!"
5,Very Challenging and Fun!,This book was great. So are the rest of the books in the series. They are challenging and require scrutinization of both the exhibits and the court case. Unlike many othe 'Choose your own adventure' books this one is actually a challenge.
5,Toad hits the road again!,Watch out world toad's got a new mania and it's motorcars! This crazy driver will do anything to get his hands on a motorcar. You should do the same to own this video!
4,my son,my son had me get this book for him. he really liked it. he wants more.That says a lot about the book. (he is 17)
1,Not what I thought it was,"Thought I was looking at the novelization of the movie ""Aliens."" which I seem to remember reading back in college. Not it!"
4,Great conclusion to the trilogy!,"I love the Midnighters series and Scott Westerfeld's writing in general. I've been looking forward to the conclusion of the trilogy and wasn't disappointed. The entire novel was action-packed, filled with witty little lines, and darkling infested.I love how the change in Rex is portrayed and Melissa's change, too. Dess is her usual awesome self, and Jonathan and Jessica are as close as ever. Beth, Jessica's little sister, was starting to get on my nerves a bit, but that's what younger siblings do in general, so Mr. Westerfeld captured that perfectly.The world of midnight as readers knew it up until this moment was twisted and warped in this novel in a great new way. I think that everyone should give this series at least a chance, even if it's not what you'd usually go for.I give `Blue Noon' 4/5 stars."
2,A Bittersweet End,"Westerfield is brilliant; bringing in so many twists and turns to leave us hungry for more. However, the ending left me wanting more, wishing for something different. IT was indeed bittersweet. The book up to that point was extremely enjoyable and fun."
2,Good book but this edition missing pages,"The book was good, but pages 284 to 312 were replaces with 30 pages from previous chapters. It is cleary a manufcaturing default, and I was disappointed to have to skip the thirty pages, and not know what happened towards the end."
4,Westerfield Strikes Again!,"If you liked the Uglies trilogy, you're will like the Midnighters too! Interesting fantasy with realistic characteristics."
3,Disappointment,Blue Noon was a total disgrace. I cannot believe why jessica did that. She won't be able to go to the daytime anymore. she's apart of midnight.it will be an eternity for her in that world. only living an hour a day. that's ludicrous.poor jonathon. and beth. how she had to find out. but it is a good thing that she's going to help future midnighters. i give her that. and also now she won't have to use gadgets to use her powers. she could just aim her hand at you and your dead.
2,too $$$ & defective,Was very excited to buy this multi-cooker. The size was perfect for me and I liked the style. Unfortunately the price was very steep but I was willing to spend the money for a quality product. Took it out of the packaging and after washing put it on the stove. It did not sit flat & was warped (the base). Thought I'd try cooking in it anyway and see if heat would make a difference but all's that did was cause a burn mark on one spot on the bottom of the pan and in the interrior. Washed and returned the item and got a refund. Purchased a compairable multi-cooker at a department store and am happy w/ it. Plus I realize a glass lid is best (which the Krona brand did not have) so as to see how things are progressing while cooking. You can find one of these just as nice and for half the price elsewhere.
3,Not worth the price,"I bought this product based on the reviews, but it was totally not worth the money. I have relatively dry/curly hair and this product did nothing for me. I would not buy this again, because it does not do what it says it will do. I would not recommend buying this product...and I'm an honest critic."
2,Take it or leave it,Didn't really knock my socks off after I paid a pretty penny for it. I've used it a couple times now and my hair is alright. This morning I used Panteve Pro-V Smooth and my hair feels more fantastic with this than the Kerastase Shampoo.
3,Don't really get the appeal....,A salon recommended these products to me and I bought them. My hair does not look or feel any different than it does with cheap shampoo I buy in the drug store. Not sure why anyone would spend the extra money.
4,Hair getting thicker and stronger,"I love this shampoo. It made my hair very strong. But there is one downside. My hair feels very stiff.But I think it was worth of my money. I will keep on buying them.Giving 4 start because it's too expensive. Other than that, I would definitely use it."
5,excellent product,Ease of installation.Had 4 installed in less than 10 minutes.Fit was perfect & overall look versus exterior tape visors is worth the few extra bucks.Fit very nicely into the window channels & you might lose about 1 inch of usable right hand mirror view.I would purchase this product again for any truck or car.
5,EGR Slimline,"The bottom line is that the EGR Slimline window visor is by far the best visor on the market. However, I would urge you to be careful in your selection as EGR offers two visors, tape and tape-less models. I purchased the tape-less type and could not be any happier. Installation is so easy a Congressman could install it!"
1,No Fit,"I ordered the visors for a ford explorer sport trac, which the write up said it would fit, but when delivered, was no where near the right match. The order number were right, but on the box, they were for a ford F150, which is not the same shape as the sport trac. They were nice looking visors, but unfortunetly, I had to return them. A second try revealed the same problem."
1,Not what I ordered or as described,"I ordered these for a 2012 Hyundai Genesis and I received parts for a Ford Pickup. The description states 'tapeless'; however, the rear ones have tape on them and the directions state peeling the tap off...etc, etc, etc...I bit the bullet and ordered the 'weathertech' product as I had done in the past; didn't like the $15 delivery charge...oh well..."
2,"One CD nice, other not so nice","The ""Sea of Dreams"" CD is nice. The other CD, ""Mystic Sea"" is terrible. I can't stand to listen to it. The music is very dischordant--definately not very relaxing. I can't listen to more than a few seconds of it before I have to turn it off."
4,great puzzle for toddlers,"This is a great little puzzle for the truck loving toddler set. This was my daughter's first puzzle that involved pieces that can move around (i.e. that don't fit into a single slot). It only has 9 pieces and 7 of them are edge pieces so it is perfect for a kid figuring out the rules of this kind of puzzle. The picture underneath helps so it is challenging but not frustrating for a kid who already can do the slot puzzles. My daughter used it as a springboard and within a month of getting this had moved on to the the 23 piece Jumbo Firetruck Puzzle. Because of this, I think it is pretty clear that the recommended age range (2-5) is wrong. She got it when she was 19 months old, did it a lot for a month, then enjoyed doing it occasionally for a couple more months. At 23 months she has grown out of it. Even taking into account differences between kids, the upper age limit for this puzzle is probably 3."
3,OK Toy,"My 2yr old son received this for his 2nd birthday from my sister and has absolutley no interest in it at all. He loves puzzles, and he loves firetrucks so we thought it would be a big hit, but it just sits around collecting dust. It is a good price, the ""latches"" firetruck that Melissa&Doug makes is much more fun, but very pricey."
3,Mom of Twins,"I got the fire truck puzzle for my 20 month old twin boys, who love all types of vehicles, especially emergency vehicles, and have ""graduated"" from the single shape peg puzzles. They loved the fire truck, but required assistance to put it all together. My criticism is that the fire truck puzzle pieces could be cut according to parts of the fire truck, such as wheels, window, etc, which would also conceptually teach the parts of a vehicle and make putting the puzzle back together more logical/easier."
3,nice doll but absolutely not worth the money,"nice quality doll, very nice soft outfit but absolutely not worth the price, max 30-40$.also they at least could have included a pacifier , to make the doll more interesting."
5,My daughter loves her bebe do.,"This Corolle Bebe Do was my daughter's first baby doll at 18 months. She loves and cares for this doll so much. She sleeps with her and brings her everywhere. Corolle makes beautiful dolls with a vanilla baby scent. This doll is well worth the price, a lesser quality doll would not do."
4,Nice baby doll,"Although purchased in February, I just gave it to my 14-month-old granddaughter three weeks ago. She loved it and really responded to the closing eyes. At this time, the eyes still work (although they have been poked a number of times). She loves ""the baby,"" and likes to feed it with the bottle (although she puts the bottle in her own mouth more often)."
3,Old Crows are Wise Crows,"I have just finished reading this book. While a number of references are out of date (like paper-tape storage), this book is full of useful information on how real-time and multitasking computing is done. My background is Electronic Engineering. All the examples are for chemical processes but still get the point across. I work at with an advanced fighter simulator doing avionics testing. I am recommending this book to all my fellow engineers. If you can find a copy of this book (or better yet an update version) get it, read it, and use it. I will."
5,What do Executive Coaches Do? This Book Told Me.,"I became curious about ""Executive Coaching"" after reading an article in Forbes Magazine last year. The article showed astounding salaries (some of these coaches make as much money in a day as many of us make in a year) and major companies (General Electric, Sony, Johnson & Johnson, Ernst & Hewlett-Packard) using ""executive coaches"".Well this book tells you what these ""executive coaches"" do and I found it fascinating!"
5,The best book on 5-card draw high poker anywhere,"5-card draw high poker is a dieing game in the US. This book is by far the best on this game; at least of the 50 or so poker books I have read. It is also an excellent book to get ""Tells"", body language that gives away the opponents hand. Even if you do not play draw high this book is great for any poker player. On the down side it has considerable bigotry which cannot be avoided. Ignore that, go for the strategy and tactics, and this book is for you"
2,Who plays 5-card draw any more?,"This is a pretty good book, but it doesn't address the games that are actually played in poker rooms now: Texas hold 'em and 7-card stud. So it is of no use to most players today."
1,Terrible translation ruins movie,Wong Kar Wai is one of my favorite directors and I'm happy to see so many of his films coming to Blu Ray. I don't normally review purchases but I had to review this one to deter other fans out there from purchasing this blu ray release. The visual quality is fantastic on this release but the subtitles are AWFUL. It's written in broken english with really bad grammar. The horrible translation ruins the poetic nature of the dialogue and completely ruins the movie. Wait for a criterion release of this film.
5,Poetic and Beautiful,"An unconventional romantic drama about time and love. ""Days of Being Wild"" features beautiful cinematography and hauntingly memorable lines. This is a must see for fans ofIn the Mood for Love - Criterion Collectionand2046. Another Wong Kar-Wai masterpiece that has influenced much world cinema including the American indpendentTime and Tide"
4,REALLY NEW ARCHITECTURE,"THIS BOOK CONTAINS SOME OF THE BEST ARCHITECTURE IN THE WIDE WORLD, BESIDES ANDREAS PAPADAKIS AND OTHER AUTHORS WRITE ABOUT THE LAST TENDENCES IN MODERN ARCHITECTURE IN THE MODERN CITIES."
5,The boy who has everything!,"Our 3 year old has so much that sometimes it seems like nothing keeps his interest for long. This little tin drum keeps him busy and feeling like he is in his own marching band! Cute as anything, we love watching him walk around holding this tiny tin drum around his neck and going to town on it. Great gift! It was a little smaller than I anticipated, would of liked the strap to be a little longer to go around his neck, but not a big deal, he doesn't seem to mind?"
3,Minature Drum,"Buyer beware and read the diameter or any drums you may buy for child carefully. I wanted a drum for my son to wear around his neck as he has shown much interest in carrying things around his neck and thought this would be cute especially because of his love affair with Thomas the train. However it is so small and yes now looking on the site I see it says 7 in diameter which I would have expected to have been larger. This looks like it is a drum for a doll and the drumsticks match the drum and are just tiny, probably wont send them back though because they are for his Thomas themed party and want as much Thomas present as possible and he may not find them as annoyingly miniature as I do. He is a very tall little man and I think that the drum might look too small for him or any two year old. I am disappointed!"
2,"Fun toy, but not sturdy enough for a 2 1/2 year old.","I bought this toy drum for my 2 1/2 year old grandson, who loves both music and trains. He loved it, but within a couple of days, he had pushed in the drum cover on both sides. It's still usable, but somewhat battered. Wish it had been made a bit stronger."
5,Excellent value,"Of all the musical instruments we have, this one gets used most by my toddler daughter as well as all our little friends that visit. Good sound, durable, and the little ones LOVE to walk around with it hanging around their neck like a marching band drum."
3,enjoyed to death,"My sons loved their ""hook up drum"" to death. It did not tolerate being stepped on. Their grandmother bought them a floor drum which seems to be standing up to their abuse better. They are 2 1/2 and 4."
1,drumskin tore within 30 min.,The drum skin is very thin. I ended up buying a electornic hard rubber drum set for my 2 year old grandson. He loves it.
1,This product is not for a 4 yr old.,The tin is very flimsy. The strap is very uncomfortable around a childs neck. I would not recommend this for anyone.
4,Small and a lot of fun,"My nephew loves trains and Thomas - this was a perfect gift for him. He loves it. It's a nice size for a toddler, but pretty small for an older kid."
3,Fun but Easily Broken,"It is a nice drum when it is not broken. It lasted one week before it was completely dented in and the top destroyed because it found it's way near the bottom of a toy bin. Otherwise, the sound is good and my toddler really enjoyed it while we had it. I am glad it was only about $10."
3,It is a good drum for the price and size,"I bought it for my daughter as a christmas gift. My daughtet loves it, it is one of her favorite toys. The size was perfect for her and it is comfortable. I would not recommend for 4 years and up because it will be too small. It is the perfect drum for a two or three year old."
5,Very Didactic,"A book full of exercise, you will be amazed how much you learn without knowing. I found a video podcast related with the book, and presentations on-line too.For the podcast go to i Tunes U directory and look for ""HTEC 60A"". for the presentations go to google and type the same""HTEC 60A"".You won't need good luck with all this material.... You REALLY learn with all these tools."
2,Performance Dashboards,"The first two-thirds of the book were extremely disappointing and added very little value to the understanding of how to create effective dashboards. Instead, the author spent far too much time discussing IT concepts and buzzwords such as datamarts, multidimensional databases, operational data stores and OLAP tools. Much of the book reads as a platform for why one needs to invest in IT to help manage your business performance. It wasn't until the final third of the book that some useful concepts were explored regarding how a non-IT person should go about developing a solid performance dashboard."
4,Best Description Yet of Dashboard Goals and Structure,"This is the first book that I have read that gives a good overview of how and why you would use a dashboard. It has a good flow and give you information you can use. It is a little dry, but it is hard to make this too exciting."
1,Not worth it,"I found most of the recipes not to our taste. If I do try the 2 or 3 that might be good, I will definitely use my slowcooker, since that is the cooking method that seems to make the most sense for these recipes."
5,NOT - uncomplicated but....WOW,"The recipes in this book are often somewhat complex, but they are easy to follow and the results are wonderful. Braising does not aways take a long time either. One of my favorites is Soy-Braised Chicken Thighs with Star Anise and Orange Peel - 40 minutes total."
4,Wonderful,"This book was everything I was hoping it would be. It was filled with easy to find ingredients and yummy receipes. Some will take time, but it was worth the wait!"
5,"Wonderful flavor, easy preparation",A friend who's a chef gave me this cookbook for Christmas. I'm completely hooked. The author does a great job of laying out the basic braising technique very clearly then providing recipes for application. Loved the drawings of the various braising vessels: made it very clear what the author was talking about. I enjoy cooking but am certainly not a trained chef. This book gives me enough detail that I can easily make every recipe and even modify them if I want to. Most all ingredients are easy for me to find in a large city. Well worth purchasing!
5,My current favorite cookbook,"I purchased this cookbook when it first came out and have made numerous recipes all of which were great. A few of my favorites so far....Pork roast w/ apricots, cardamom & ginger; Zin Pot Roast; Veal shanks with rosemary and honey and whole chicken braised with pears & Rosemanry. The instructions, ingredients, and style of the recipes rank high in my opinion. Molly Stevens has produced a cookbook that offers sophisticated yet uncomplicated one dish meals glamourous enough for the best of company.8 years later this continues to be one of my favorite cook books and one which I frequently give friends and family."
5,This book took me to a higher level of home cooking.,"I found this on Amazon.com at a fantastic price and it came sooner than expected.This book details ways to make ordinary vegetables into a magnificent meal, with or without meat.She also describes how to use ordinary pots or pans on hand to create the best braising results. I was excited to learn simple ways to make ordinary food into exciting meals.The author is an experienced and well traveled chef. I am pleased to recommend this book to friends and family that want home cooked meals that are far from the ordinary experience.Reading and following this book was like cooking with a friend. Her candid writing style made it easy to understand her brasing philosophy and simple to follow the recipes."
4,"Top Cookbook, Needs More Pictures Though","I got this cookbook after receiving a dutch oven for my birthday, and not really knowing anything about braising or how to use it. This book has recipes for just about any meat and lots of vegetable recipes. So far I've only cooked a Pot Roast and Leg of Lamb, and I've got to say that the pot roast was the best I've ever had. This is a great primer for anyone who wants tasty ideas and extremely detailed recipes.My only complaint is that it needs more pictures."
5,No matter what stage you are at...,"I am a long time serious cook and I learned some new things. Good recipes, great explanations - a mini cooking course in a book"
4,All About Braising,When I was 4 I used to watch my grandma braising the potroast on top of the stove. And it was always delicious. Until I got this book I didn't know you could braise other things. Good book. Good tips. Good recipes. Any lidded skillet can become a braiser but several styles are illustrated. Nothing complicated about it. Who knew?
5,The details in this book make all the difference,"This is the best book on braising I have read. It makes a definite distinction between braising and slow-cooking, and gives you all of the details and factors to consider when preparing a dish. Everything from cookware, ingredients and techniques are explained in great detail.This cookbook reads like a novel! I found myself sitting and reading it for enjoyment from cover to cover rather then just looking up a particular recipe. And the recipes are fantastic!"
5,Tom Hardy great,"I love Tom Hardy in this . I like all the characters I thought it was very intertesting to see the era , and what happens to the rest of the family of mobsters."
2,OVERRATED!!!,"Don't believe the hype. This is average at best. Yes, Tom Hardy is great in it but that's about it. His performance can't save this train-wreck. To sum it all, full of cliches and predictable story line. Go watch Goodfellas or Boardwalk Empire for some real gangsters thrills."
3,Cheap paint,"I got this paint for my home daycare because it seemed like a good value. Well, it didn't come with a brown (which was the color I really wanted) like in the picture, although I do realize ""colors may vary"" means you get what you get. So that wasn't a big deal, but I was disappointed in the quality of the paint. It's cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for. It's watery and runny, and doesn't show up great on construction paper. I got it just in time to do some Christmas projects, and the Santa handprints I tried to do on light blue constuction paper barely showed up, and even after I put a lot of paint on the kids' hands, it was still hard to see. But, since I'm just an at-home provider trying to save a buck or two, this product will work for me (or I figure out a way to make it work better!). If it had a better consisitancy, I would have given it 5 stars."
3,"Nice, but watery","Some of the lighter colors are VERY transparent. All of the colors are pretty watery, but at least the darker colors actually show up, unlike the lighter colors. Orange is a pretty dark color to be light and it still barley shows up. It's just watery and super light. Don't even try to use them on construction paper it will not show up. I brought theses for my 3 year old daughter and she even sees a differences in the deepness of the colors and chooses to use the darker colors over the lighter ones. The orange for example she will use so much of that trying to get it to actually show up then gets tired and starts using the purple and doesn't use as much and is satisfied with how it looks."
5,Old Grimes,Genealogy has it that Old Grimes is a long lost relative. So I have really enjoyed having it in my possession. Thank you for finding it for me.
2,A Hot Time in Alaska,"In old San Francisco a fire company passes by and two rescue a drowning man (he has lost the love of Rosette). Their comic skits go on with variations on arithmetic. They all get a laugh from the newspaper story. Next they land at Skagway. Nugget Joe finally meets Rosette the singer. Stillman explains his plans: Rosette marries Joe, then inherits as his widow. Gold can change people. George has beginner's luck at roulette, then loses it all. Next they will travel to an Eskimo village (to continue comic skits). An accident releases their dogs, they are lost in Alaska.George and Tom don't have luck fishing. They are rescued. George tries whale meat. There is a dance and singing. Tom and George fight so Joe and Rosette can escape. The search among the igloos recalls the game of cups and a hidden ball.This must be the least funny of their movies. The comic skits are good, but the story is poor."
2,definitely not the best book on ikebana,"The problem with this book is that most of the shown arrangements are plainly not beautiful. They don't look balanced as real ikebana should look, containers don't seem suitable for flowers, color combinations are not always harmonious, and in many cases it is not clear why this is called ikebana at all. There are some pieces of useful information such as diagrams, tools, and tips, but I don't think it reasonable to buy the book for those 10 pages (like I did).There is a really great book on ikebana: ""The art of arranging flowers; a complete guide to Japanese ikebana"" by Shozo Sato, but it is out of print I am afraid. For examples of good ikebana look at these sites: http://www.nihonkoryu.org/, http://homepages.stmartin.edu/fac_staff/elias/index.htm, http://www.ikebanahq.org/"
5,it was good,"i thought that this book , just like the rest of the series . i love v.c.andrews . she is so ggood . i love how she always has action in her books . i think that the new writer is doing just as good of a job ."
3,Family Trouble and a Custody Hearing,"Heaven and Logan had a beautiful wedding. Heaven wanted to have a good relationship with Luke, whom she had known as her dad when she was little. Shortly after she got reacquainted with Drake Heaven discovered this ugly fact: Tony had forbidden Luke to have any contact with her. I would be very angry if somebody told anybody I wanted to hear from not to ever speak to me at all. What's worse was Tony assaulted Heaven again. Fanny did stoop low to try to turn Drake against Heaven. The truth eventually came out when it came to the hearing about Drake's custody. Fanny needed to learn the hard way that a relationship shouldn't be started with lies. I believe that Heaven is a more competent guardian for Drake than Fanny would be."
3,Fallen Hearts ~ book 3 in the Casteel Saga,"It's a good book that follows Dark Angel (book 2) in the series. It could have been read as a stand alone book, but better if you have read Heaven and Dark Angel prior to reading this one. I found it to be a bit long winded in some places. I was just like ""ok already, get to it!!). But V.C. Andrews had passed away and you can see the difference in the writting styles. Not saying this is bad, just different. It was nice to catch up on what happened with everyone. I feel that there could have been more of a story about Keith and Our-Jane. They just fell out of the story by this time.Bottom line, if you are reading the Heaven series, then this is a must read book. If someone just picked it up as a stand alone read, I wouldn't recommend it.Rhonda"
2,Not impressed with new author,"I did not like how Heaven would on and on about her thoughts, memories, and descriptions. I found myself skipping over pages."
1,Strip-mining for profit and greed,"I discovered V.C. Andrews by chance, when I was a houseguest searching my host's bookshelves for a good read. I found the first two Casteel novels, and I enjoyed the tight, competent writing and intriguing plotlines.I recently picked up ""Fallen Hearts,"" and -- after the first 100 pages -- I won't finish it. I just learned that the book was written by a ghost author after V.C. Andrew's death; the contrast is remarkable. This novel's trite and predictable, and the writing is on par with that of a supermarket romance novel.Don't waste your time."
3,Aaaw!,"My name is Kim and I just finished reading ""Fallen Hearts"" for a project for school. After years of seeing each other, Logan and Heaven finally get married. But then, Tony Tatterton invites the couple to live at Farthinggale Manor. Heaven is reluctant to go. Years ago she had lived at Farthy, and lost her love, a man named Troy. Her love for Troy was even greater then hers for Logan, and Heaven doesn't want to be reminded of all the pain she went through. But, catering to her husband's requests, they make their way to the dark and dreary mansion that has only held bad memories for Heaven. This was a terriffic romance novel with plenty of suspence. Not Ms. Andrew's best work but pretty good."
4,Confirming what you may expect!,"This book confirms what you may already suspect in an authoritarian church. Not all of it applies to every situation, but you will find your situation if you are a part of it."
1,church book,I never recieved my book can u send me tracking information to find out where it is. thank u Judith
2,Churches that abuse,Very preachy and boring. Doesn't hit on the topic of the book.Not satisfied with book at all.
5,Could It Happen Here? Spiritual Abuse Around Us,"This book is a must-read for those who have suffered spiritual abuse, and for those who work with them. Mr. Enroth gives many real life stories of persons who became involved in harmful churches and groups. He shares what happened to these individuals, and then describes the patterns of abuse so that the reader can recognize signs of abuse or potential abuse. The reader will be able to see the similarities among various groups. The psychological and sociological ramifications are described. An extremely important contribution; this book will enlighten, warn, instruct, and maybe even shock you."

5,fantastic,I always loved this book and all the author's other stories. I wish she had written more books. Her characters are approachable and yet approriatley foreign. The land is just obscure enough to not be ours but yet relatable enough to makeit viable. I love her humor and her characterization.
1,"Looks great, fell apart first wash!","I really wanted to like these green apple kitchen towels. They're very attractive and Calphalon brand, and I particularly liked the green. They were absorbent too. BUT, after the first wash they absolutely fell apart. The seams gave way and I washed them per manufacturer's instructions! They were ruined after 1 gentle wash.Thankfully the store took them back, no problem. For $7 a towel you expect better!"
5,Finally -- quality.,"A beautiful dish towel, it's large and of good quality which is hard to find these days. If one must dry dishes, it's a pleasure to use."
2,Pretty but stiff,"Love the style and if you only use it for show it is decorative, however I use everything and this towel does not easily get into the nooks and crannies of the things I dry in the kitchen. The fabric is too stiff. Would not recommend."
3,Pretty good purchase,"I was looking for a good looking towel, since I hang them on hooks in my kitchen, but also one that actually dried things (some terry towels really are not very absorbent.) I like the sharp modern style of the towel and it keeps it's shape after washing too. Absorbs well, better than the solid color Calphalon towel."
3,Towel Not As Described in Amazon's Description,"The description indicates that there are ""....terry loops on both sides...."" for hanging purposes. There are no such loops on the towel I just received. There is, however, a single tab type loop made of something similar to bias tape located near the middle of the towel on one length-wise side of the towel. Other than the ""how to wash"" tab located on one end, there is nothing else by which to hang the towel. Strongly recommend Amazon staff clean up the description appearing on their web page to accurately reflect a true description of the towel being sold. Inaccurate product descriptions seemed to appear more and more during 2010 at least on products I was interested in. Example: I looked at some tea discs and the description was all about the ""....dark, fresh roast coffee bean blend...."". Not one word about the tea. One can only hope that this trend is not going to become the norm rather than the exception."
4,"Up, Up & Away","Wharton dashes from the starting gate with a character who dreams of tornados. This is most appropriate to describe the central theme of the collection. Some of the people living inside Wharton's head are adulterers, victims of unrequited love, or on death row awaiting execution for being a little too intense when it comes to love. One contemplates the irony of religious persecution. It would be easy to write that Wharton takes on numerous clichÃ©s and gives them new life but the internal dialogue of his avant-garde characters keeps well off the path most traveled. In the end Wharton's collection whips into quite a finale as it sucks his protagonist up into the heart of an actual tornado. Read Johnny Was and take a look at the world from the inside of the maelstrom."
5,Eloquent,"The never ending quest is writen in the most eloquent, emotionally moving style. I adore books that are introspective and will be on a never ending quest for more titles by Steven Herberts."
5,the never ending quest,"This book was the most riveting poetry book that I have ever read. I am moved beyond verbiage, which is unusual for me. I recommend this book to anyone who loves poetry."
5,Excellent Read,"This book is an excellent read. Easy to understand and thorough, it assists the ""average Joe"" who wants to go from earning minimum wage to earning th $6F."
5,Genius!,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. It's absolutely hysterical and truly horrifying - a perfect combination! Who needs CGI when you have special effects like this?! The chase scene in the subway - excuse me, the tube - is flat out terrifying. And the transition from the closing scene to the credits is brilliant. LOVE IT!"
1,SUCH A IDIOTIC AND SICKENING WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT,"EVERYONE HERE DON'T THINK OF BUYING THAT CRAP IT'S JUST A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME ,PEOPLE WHO GO ON THIS DIET SUFFER FOR LIFE TIME ,I TRIED IT AND I WAS SUFFERING FROM A DISORDER WITH MY EATING HABITS AND I HAVE VISITED LOTS OF DOCTORS TO CURE MY ILLNESS I BECAME SELF OBSESSED AND AND NEVER KNEW ITS RIGHT FOR ME TO EAT OR NOT ....PLEASE DONT TRY THIS BOOK AT ALL RISKS ITS NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE OF ANY AGE ,JUST BE ON A STABLE DIET AND WELL BALANCED MEALS AND U WILL LOSE WEIGHT ,OR TRY SOMETHING LIKE LOW-FAT DIET OR A PROTEIN DIET EVEN WOULD DO."
1,Low quality stainless finish,"Nice cooking pot, solid and just the right size. BUT, had to return this twice for the same reason: After one wash in the dishwasher, both had pitted finishes on the handles and rim.Too bad really, thought I had a great replacement for our 30 year old Farberware (the original high quality American made ones) pots."
1,Absolute rubbish,"Audiotape, Inc? Who the hack are they? Here's your answer. Wait for it.... they're a bootlegging rubbish outfit. This dvd is a fake. It's garbage. It ain't an Apple product. It's a piece of nothing rubbish produced by people who like making money off other people's fame. Can we say PARASITES?"
5,BUNGEE LEASH - the BEST,"This is a great product. It will take the pressure off your dogs neck, and even when they learn to NOT pull, it is still a fabulous item because it is designed to take the pressure off of your shoulders as well.I found the customer service at Bungee to be exceptional. I had ordered the leash for up to 165 lbs and my pup at the time only weighed in at 45. But I was thinking it would work as she grew. But I did put a note in their comment box saying I wasn't sure about the right size. They called me and suggested that I buy the one for pups under 60lbs as the up to 165 would not have any give for a dog her size. I did this and have loved it since the moment I put it on her.Thanks for making such a great product"
5,"""SQUIRREL!""","My puppy seeing something he'd like to chase is never a problem with this leash. I don't get my arm torn out of it's socket and he doesn't have pressure on his neck that might be harmful to him. While he's learning not to pull and to mind me on walks, it's a lifesaver...literally.This leash has turned a simple walk from a dreaded nightmare to the pleasurable experience it ought to be. Recommended highly!"
2,It works,"It is only the chime, and nothing else. You have to buy a transformer, and a switch to get it working. It does work though."
2,just a minimum,"This is a small picture book of holyday pictures, the images are honest, but neither very artistic, nor put togehter in a very informative global picture. I purchased this book together with a german and a french book to prepare a phototrip to Myanmar. I must say that the French book ""la Birmanie"" and the German Book ""Burma"" were much more helpfull in every prospect. Unfortunately there are only very few informations about how to prepare your journey in Myanmar. It is a honest series of pictures, but it is not a photo guide."
5,ONE OF ABBOTT & COSTELLO'S BEST FILMS,"Charles Lamont does a GREAT job directing this Abbott and Costello vehicle. The team spoofs the sci-fi film genre of the time in this film. Despite the film's title, they ACTUALLY land on Venus with two escaped convicts. A few of the film's highlights include the duo landing their spaceship in a wooded area outide the New Orleans city limits. Because it is Mardi Gras season, and everyone is wearing bizzare costumes, Bud & Lou UNWITTINGLY believe that they landed on Mars. Another highlight is the runaway ship's flight through New York City. And the scene where it looks like the spaceship is going to SMASH into the Statue of Liberty, and Lou YELLS for her to duck. Which she does-LITERALLY. This amusing scene has NEVER BEFORE been recaptured on film. This is Abbott & Costello at their VERY BEST."
3,Out Of This World,Abbott & Costello Go To Mars is a very amusing movie. Children will love this picture...I did when I was a child. It's very lighthearted...not so funny for the adult audience...but nevertheless should be referred to as a classic. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The only reason I don't give it a better star rating is because it could've been funnier...not too many laugh out loud sequences but certainly plenty of amusement. A movie the whole family can sit and watch together.
5,The Trivium,"This is an amazing book, so interesting that I purchased a second copy to send to a friend. It is difficult reading but very satisfying and rewarding."
1,"Great book, arrived damaged","The book is great: a concise introduction to logic and its related disciplines. It contains more material than most university graduates and post-graduates (esp., but not limited to engineering and science) would ever see in all their academic and professional careers -- exactly the stuff that makes an education what it ought to be, the 'Ph.' in Ph.D. Sadly the book arrived with a big bruise in the lower front left spine. A brand new book with a brand new flaw. Recently, Amazon customer service has been pretty unresponsive, so I'll have to live with it."
3,It was recommended by a friend. It was interesting to learn about the Chinese culture in the eighteen hundreds.,It was recommended by a friend. It was interesting to learn about the Chinese culture in the eighteen hundreds. I deslike that it was too long.
3,Empress Orchid,I liked this book because I am interested in Chinese history. I like to compare the old Chinawith what it now.
4,Looking Forward to the Next One,I really enjoyed this story a thought it was beautifully written. I did not realize that it was the first in a series until I got to the end and I can't wait to read more. Before I read this book I knew nothing about the Forbidden City and I found my sell totally captured by the tale. It dragged alittle when the were heading back to the city at the end but overall I would recommend this book.
4,Invites the reader to more,"Knowing relatively little about this place or time, this book held my interest and invited me to learn more. I may find out that there were gross misprepresentations of fact but suspect that the book was of sufficient accuracy to be worth the my time. Anchee Min painted a sweeping portrait of life in the Chinese imperial court with its opulence and varied layers motives and relationships. Fictionalized or not, it does give insight into the histroy of China and the events and beliefs that have brought it into the present time. If you are seeking a strictly informational book, you will be disappointed but I doubt that this was ever the author's intent."
5,Simply wonderful!,"This book is filled with drama, intrique, loyalty, corruption, forbidden love and mystery. The Forbidden City is a totally different world for the book's heroine, Orchid, who becomes one of the Emperor's wives at the age of 17. Ms. Min has written a spellbinding novel, with colorful and interesting charactors, rich detail and a vivid, interesting history of China, complete with details on customs, rituals and distictions between the Manchu's and the Chinese. Orchid and her eunech, An-te-hai will keep the reader spellbound. This is the first book that I've read by Ms. Min and I couldn't put it down! Bravo!! This novel took me to another time and place and I couldn't have been more pleased!!!!"
3,Wish it can be more truthful to the history,"I understand this is a novel, so I can't expect a novel to have a lot of truth to it. Yet, since it's based on an empress in Chinese history, I wish it has more facts ties to the story.The novel portraits Empress Orchid as a person with compassion to the Chinese people, loves for her husband and her son. Yet, it's simply too far from the truth. It's distractive to read about her compassion and kindness and thinking about her as a ruthless person who is willing to do anything to gain powers."
5,Mind Candy for the Imagination,"Empress Orchid is one of those books that once you start reading, not only is it difficult to put down, but the story wraps itself around you and is reluctant to let go. Min's narration is lush and captivating. I'm looking forward to the other books in the series!"
2,Snoozer,"While reading this novel, I wanted to be ""awarded"" the white silk rope to hang myself. Boring, slow, characters dancing in and out.Not a good read."
1,Customized for Westerners.,"Author tried so hard to sell this book to English speakers. Facts conflict with the Chinese history though authors ""claims"" her ""version"" is true. In this excessively-detailed book (about strong-smart-mean-ugly Chinese impress who had significant influence on today's Chinese history) is full of ""western"" romance which was totally unacceptabe and unimaginable to Chinese culture, tradition of that time. One of the worst books I've read. If you like this book, Sorry, you don't have clue on China and Chinese history, culture and everything about China.It's up to you if you have time and money to waste, though."
5,Completely Compelling,"I am a housewife with 3 small children who never gets time to read. I saw this book reviewed on a TV programme from the UK and decided to buy it while going on a weekend away. It is the best thing I have ever done. I just could not put it down. I feel like I was just plodding along in life, caught up with rearing children after giving up my job and any real interests. Since reading this I have become completely obsessed with chinese history. The book just took me over, I can't wait to read others by this author. For anyone who has a heart it is a compelling read."
3,Good....Not Great....,"Anchee Min has an interesting and well-told story here, but to my mind not quite up to previous works (Red Azalea and Becoming Madame Mao were fantastic). I thought the first half of the book or so was a bit slow and then moved along better at the end; we see more deeply into the main character near the book's conclusion. This is fun and good reading but not, as I understand, historically accurate. Some of the details are very hard to imagine being real or true. I've purchased Sterling Seagraves' biography of the empress and look forward to reading that. I will go on and read Min's other books and expect to be entertained."
3,"Interesting subject, but too soap-opera-ish","Interesting for those who like historical novel. I was intrigued after reading the first couple pages at a book store so I picked it up. However, as I got more into the novel, I was disappointed at the ordinariness of prose and the soap-opera-ish tone of the novel."
3,Behind the Palace Walls,"Min's story of Orchid, a rural teenager of noble blood who submits herself for consideration as one of the Emperor's 3000 concubines in order to save her family from poverty, is heart-wrenching and horrifying. The author's strength lies in her ability to bring to life 19th century empirial China -- in all its splendor and bloody ruthlessness. However, Orchid lost my sympathy halfway through the book when her manipulative ways overshadowed her tenderness. The novel does bring to mind questions of family, loyalty, and love. Worth a read."
2,Was hoping to love this book !,"I picked up this book at the airport hoping for a good read on my transatlantic flight. The cover suggested that I would be pulled into the intrigue of the Forbidden City and I was eager to begin. Sadly the book failed to live up to its promise ! Although the author is obviously very knowledgable on her subject it just never caught on fire for me. The first 1/2 of the book was the best part as we were introduced to the details of Orchid's life, but the long section after her son's birth just dragged and dragged as new characters were introduced, new situations hurried through, and the promised intrigue failed to materialise. I did finish the book and the last few chapters were a little better. I felt that the author may have been over editorialised and had she been given a free hand would have produced a longer, more detailed book which despite its length would have proved more interesting. I was left with an empty feeling and a desire to know more."
1,SandyS,"I was very disappointed with this item. With a famous name like Ghiradelli I would have thought it would be of better quality. It was very ealily returned through Amazon, as they make it easy with a printable return label. I purchase something in it's place again through Amazon. Thank you Sandy S"
3,No gift card!!!!!,"I am not sure if the basket was okay or not, however, they did not include the gift card! Since this is a company selling GIFT baskets, that seems to be a major omission. I would not use this company again as to avoid the same issue."
4,Good Product - Confusing Delivery,"Ordered this for a sister - a true chocolate freak - for Christmas. The basket was as advertised, but there was absolutely no indication in the packaging as to who had sent the gift. My sister called Wine.com to see who had sent the basket and they refused to tell her. I'm fairly certain I had checked the box indicating this was a gift, but that was apparently ignored. Wine.com did send me an e-mail saying someone had called them to see who had sent the gift, but we both found the whole thing a little disappointing and something that didn't add anything to the Christmas experience. Wine.com, you should do better."
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed at this item when it arrived. It's really a very small gift basket and not worth $40.00 (maybe $25.00). I expected more - I'd recommend avoiding this.
1,"OMG ,!!","I totally thought this would be much bigger than it is, came in a little bitty box and I though no way that can't be it, I opened it and my gosh. It's 1/5th the size they make it it look like. It has 1 chocolate bar, 2 small bags of candy, one very small box of candy and 2 hot chocolates. Not anything what the pic. Or description says I was really bummed out about it because of what I was LEd to believe it would look like. I could've saved myself a lot moneyand disappointment by making my own Griradelly basket ....never again WILL I TRUST ONLINE PICS AND DECRIPTIONS EVER !!"
3,Somewhat disappointed by quantity of basket,"The selections in the basket are all good, but I was expecting a few more contents at this price point. The basket contained 1 small box of truffles, 2 individual serving packets of hot chocolate, 1 milk chocolate bar, and 2 bags of chocolate squares. If you bought each of these products individually from Ghirardelli, it would total no more than $25, so this gift basket comes at about a $10-15 premium (it was listed at $40 when I bought). In the future I will probably buy directly from Ghirardelli."
4,"every thing was perfect,","every thing was perfect, but only thing i didn't understand i charged more than actual pries,here in EU charge you exact pries. thanks"
4,She loved it,"Got this for a friends daughter after surgery. She loved it and had to hide it from the rest of the family! My only, minor, complaint is that it took longer than I thought for delivery. It may have even said it on the site, but I didn't pay attention so I can not fault them. I am used to having ANYTHING I buy on Amazon come pretty much immediately, but this took almost a week. (including the weekend) Just remember to order it a good week in advance of when you need it and it'll be fine."
2,gift basket sucks!!,ughh!!!i regret buying this gift basket.it is not what the picture shows.and it is over price!i should have bought the goduva chocolate set rather than this!!!
5,Great gift,I got this for a friend. She loved it. It arrived quickly and in good shape. Very good purchase.
2,A bit of an embarrassment,"I usually don't even write reviews, but I felt I had to comment this time. I ordered this basked to donate to a fundraiser for injured soldiers. My friend's girlfriend was running the fundraiser, and I was completely embarrassed at the state of this basket when it arrived. It was just a bunch of items thrown into a really cheesy basket, a little Scotch tape, and then thrown into a box with a bunch of foam peanuts! When it was opened, there was stuff all over in the box. I felt so bad. I was sure I was getting a good basket to donate, and if it weren't for the fact that the items themselves were of a decent quality, this review would be 1 star. When it comes to a gift basket, presentation is almost as important as the contents. Otherwise I could have just purchased a bunch of candy bars and been done with it!"
3,"Great gift, but they forgot the CARD!","The chocolate is yummy, the basket beautiful, but the recipient didn't know who to thank because the seller forgot to attach the CARD! Major mistake."
3,"Product is great, but halfway to expired","This item came quickly and was as described, but the SFI rating tag indicated that it was already 18 months old. I had to send it back. So, if you need this item to be current for your race division, you may want to contact the seller before purchasing. If you don't mind (some sanctioning bodies only require that the net be in good repair), then you should no problems. The item was in brand new condition, just older."
3,Toy Safe,"These safe's are nice looking and fairly sturdy. They are suppose to sound and alarm when opened and the alarm on one (1) of the four(4) I bought did not work. Otherwise, locking mechanisms and size are great for kids."
4,Good safe for kids,"We bought two of these safes for our 4 and 6 year old sons. They are great for little guys who want to have their own ""secret place"". I saw some reviews that the lock and the safe itself weren't too sturdy - but it IS A TOY, not a real safe for goodness sakes! It works perfectly for the intended purpose. I do wish we could turn off (or down) the alarm..."
4,Good for 5-8 year olds,"I got this for my nephew (and the pink one for my neice) for Christmas. They are both 5-years-old. My older children also have this safe - they are 15 and 12 now, but got this when they were 5-7. My children still use their safes to store items. As others have said, the knob can be a bit hard to turn. Pushing the door shut seems to help. The alarm can be irritating, but I think we disconnected it on my son's. Overall I like it for kids."
4,they're pants...,"they cover my naughty bits, that's all i was looking for them to do. the logo faded after 2 washes though :("
4,Berlin strikes again!,"Cool sounds from this duo from Germany. Favs on this cd are: Heavy Rotation, LA Shaker, and Cobra Movement."
4,Good,"The official review says most of what I can say. Despite China Silk's various defects(thin characterizations, wallpapery settings and crazy inprobable yet predictable twists in the plot), the book is charming. Plus, we rarely see a romance novel(as the US defines it) set in the 1920s. The love scenes are rather tame, but the results are ultimately satisfying. If you're looking for a meaty, emotional read, you won't find it here, but China Silk is a decent way to pass the time."
2,Pretty pictures and mostly useless,"Extremely disappointed with this. Save yourself the time and just go hang out at www.designinmotion.com. You'll get a lot more insight into making great motion graphics.Basically, each page of the book has a different design studio, a few pretty pictures of stuff they've done, and a few paragraphs (and sometimes not even that) about why they think they're special... and occasionally, they spend a paragraph talking about their design philosophy.Very little about why or how they did a certain piece.It's useful to get the names of design studios so you can go to their web sites and look at some good portfolios, but beyond that I'm not sure what else to do with it. It's mildly inspirational, but with so many web sites offering video clips of great pieces, it's difficult for me to get excited about screenshots. A CD with the pieces shown on the pages, would have enhanced the value of the book."
4,"An entertaining movie, even for a sailor in BFE","Not a bad movie at all. I spotted it in the video rental and thought why not. It isn't the best movie in the world, but it isn't the worst one either. Of course seeing Elena naked was a big plus."
2,It's all about Erika,"Why watch this movie? It's not that good. The plot is pretty tame. The acting is nothing to speak of. Again, why? Well, if you are a fan a of nude Erika Eleniak then you watch this movie. Really that's the good part of this flick."
4,"Well, I liked it enough to keep it!","I guess being a big Berenger fan influenced my opinion of this little flick. I got quite a few laughs out of it and, even tho he is a consummate ham, William McNamarra sure is cute! Took me a long time to finally buy this DVD, but it is a keeper for me. Tom does his usual great job of being nasty/sweet and Elena Eleniak turned out to be a surprise - in more ways than one. All the cameos were fun and seeing Hopper duded out as a sleaze was really great. All in all, 101 minutes of pretty good comedy and I even enjoyed the views of the tacky southernreal estate - ouch!"
3,"Not the best, but still fun to watch.","The first episode of this tape is excellent. Ambassador Mollari recovers a long lost Centauri artifact of power, while a plot is set to overthrow the Emperor. This plot involves the Raiders, while a Centaurian psychic, Lady Ladira foretells the destruction of B5 and sees Shadows that move. And among the turmoil, a dark man appears, moving like a shadow, asking each ambassador the same thing: ""What do you want?""A fascinating episode that gives out hints of the return of an Ancient Enemy.The second part, TKO, is one of the weakest episodes of the first season. It involves a human fighter who comes to B5 to fight in an alien tournament, while Ivanova has to deal with her father's death. If you are a fan of Mortal Combat, you may like this episode. I didn't. I did enjoy one thing, though: As the episode starts, we see Ivanova reading a book. Guess who's the author? Harlan Ellison, the series conceptual consultant."
3,Vol. 1 is better,"Latin Ska is The Best, and although it does not come through generally in this album you get the feel for the variety of styles, elements, and sound found it the genre. The sound quality of the recordings in the series does not help. However, Latin Ska Underground Vol. 1 is a better album, I think. It has King Chango, and that in itself elevates it..."
2,"If you really must by some more ska then,... otherwise","This CD is a collection of Latin Ska. It is okay. Nothing really bad, but no standouts eighter."
2,One Sided Story,This book was so one sided and the author didn't even try to hide that fact. There was nothing about the the countrys history to say why the Serbs would think/know that that country was theres. Its would not be a good book for someone to read if they didn't know anything about Serbs.
5,brilliant and absorbing,"Every few years I read a book that makes me wonder most of all -- How come the literary/bookseller world isn't paying more attention to this one? I fell upon this one by accident and it is a gorgeous piece of reportage from a place we isolated Americans know nothing about. Also, it is an amazing, classic kind of American story, too -- beautifully rendered by a skilled reporter and told engagingly -- at times with great humour and always, admirable skill. Don't judge a book by its cover or either, the lack of buzz. This one's a winner."
4,Mozarabic Chant - Emphasis on ARABIC,"I'm sure other reviewers comments about this work and generally about Mozarabic chant in general are true. Christianity originated in the east and Mozarabic chant's less polished, austere qualities most likely resembles ancient christian chant. The quality of the work is unquestioned.But for a person whose hearing sensibilities have been so influenced by western gregorian chant, the heavy arabic influence in the music may prove a hard listen for the western ear.You definately want to listen to the samples before purchase."
3,slightly boring,"Gotta say, bought this disc for $40, listened to it once, resold it for $40. This was unexceptional music, indistiguishable from a lot of other chant. The raves are unwarranted."
4,You'll laugh so hard you'll fall out of your seat!,"The book was funny and very interesting. There were a lot of funny parts; like the mice thought letters were things like: B was a bee, C was the word ""see"", Hyacinth even gave her mousekins funny names like Laburnum, Larkspur and Lavender. Our favortie character was Buck because he was handsome and very interesting. One of the funniest characters we read about was Robin because he made one too many mistakes and he isn't too bright either. We really liked the book and if you want to know more just read ""The School Mouse""."
4,This is a very nice learning toy,"We purchased this for our sons, after finally finding it @ Toys'R'Us.The toy is beautifully hand-made -- as well as perfectly put together, however, it does chip very easily...Being that usually a child, as young as 1 1/2 will begin using puzzles, if interested; I think they should coat the puzzle a little better to avoid the various bumps and scraps it might encounter..Other then the slight chipping after less than a month, it is a very nice puzzle, which is actually easier for our kids to play with then the regular flat puzzles...I think it was a very good idea for motor skill improvement..."
5,Get what you pay for!,LOVE this sun shirt! My daughter has used this shirt for two summers and I am purchasing another only because she has outgrown it. The quality is superior and the fabic has not faded or broken down over two summers of use. I've had less expensive sun shirts but they barely survive the season. You definitely get what you pay for and knowing the fabic is holding strong gives me comfort that the sun isn't getting through to my daughters sensitive skin.I originally bought the two piece with the matching shorts but the waist band on the shorts are not adjustable or elastic so they were always falling off. I will only be buying the shirt this time.
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought this sunshirt for my daughter and within a week, it was all stretched out and and it has lost all its elasticity. Not worth the money I spent on this shirt."
5,It worked,I bought this because we were going to be on the water in the mountains outside of Jackson Hole. We have a family history of melanoma so I really try to be proactive. My granddaughter wore this while fishing in the mountains and floating down the Snake River. It was comfortable and she was totally protected from the effects of the sun.
1,different product,I didn't even receive this rash guard. They sent me another top without any explanation. I wanted this one because it was a full length sleeve. What I got was a three quarter length sleeve (my baby is tiny so I know it's not because it doesn't fit). The neck is not the same material as the sleeves and the piping is lower on the sleeve. It's frustrating to feel like you didn't get what you ordered. I didn't have time to send it back and get another one before her swim class started and since it is winter it is hard to find baby stores that carry a good swim top.
2,Dim yellow bulb,"This is about as bright as a dim 5 watt incandescent bulb. Anybody who says different is selling them or works for them. My pure white 2 watt cold cathode 20,000 hour CFLs are a little brighter than a 25 watt incandescent... much brighter than these & only cost me $3 each."
5,Great product,"I bought some of this at a spa after a massage and have been using the same bottle for about 6 months. My skin has been much clearer in recent months, but I hadn't thought that it was related to the cleanser (was eating a bit better too, and that helps my skin as well).I finished it up about a month ago and started using something else I had on hand. It just occurred to me today that I've been breaking out a lot more in recent weeks and that it's probably because I'm not using this anymore. So glad to see I can buy more on Amazon!To sum up - best thing is how good it is for my skin - clears skin without drying. But also, because you really only need a small amount it's a grat value as well. And it smells great and feels nice on your skin. Can't wait to get more!"
4,Goes with me EVERYWHERE!,"This book has helped me to lose over 63 pounds since last December and we're still going strong. Although I'm 8 pounds from my goal weight, I intend to keep journaling to make sure I can keep it off. This book may be a bit larger than some but it has everything you need in order to keep track of diet and exercise. The calorie info in the back is helpful in a pinch but I tend to carry the more comprehensive Calorie King book as well. I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because there is not a specific area for logging exercise and no room to enter the times food is eaten."
4,Diet Diary,This is a great tool to use when you are tracking everything you put in your mouth. It's small but sturdy so you can keep in your handbag without ruining the pages. I love it!
2,Not enough space,"This is usually the only dieting journal I ever see at bookstores, which is too bad because I really don't think it provides enough space to use it effectively. I can barely squeeze in what I ate if I write small, but I also like space for writing calories and fat grams, any exercise I did for the day, and anything extra that I might want to remember relating to my diet. I'm ordering the Dietminder, which according to the reviews is much nicer."
3,Boring,I got this book to learn more about the history of mental hospitals. Granted it is about women but they were all in different periods of psychiatry history. Really all the book was about was some ramblings of different women and there really wasn't any history to it. And no real insight into what the conditions were like or what they went through during treatment. I really don't recommend this book if you are wanting any real information.
1,I tried this one,"I tried this one and I had a hard time heating it hot enough to straiten my curly hair. Maybe if you are just doing touch-ups, but not for everything"
4,Comfy,"I don't do a lot of bike riding, but the few times I've sat on this seat, I've been comfortably pleased. It's much easier on my cheeks than the one that came on the bike."
2,Nice Seat BIG PROBLEM,"This is one of the better engineered bike seats made in China and it is comfortable EXCEPT FOR ONE BIG FLAW. I KNOW the Chinese did this on purpose, LOL. If you look close at the picture of the seat, you will see the cover is sewn in two pieces onto it to make it fit well. The lower edge (about two inches wide) that goes all the way around the bottom edge of this seat is ROUGH RUBBER! OUCH, you talk about rub burns!!!! I ride everyday about 20 miles at a time and when I got this seat, the first time I used it, I stop swearing under my breath about my butt hurting. This seat is comfortable and substantially reduces the pressure pain, BUT that rubber cover edge makes your shorts and underwear ride up like someone is giving you a weggie!!!... TOO BAD I like this otherwise.......its got to go back unless I can figure how to cover it with spandex."
2,Not comfy on a bony butt. 185 lbs,This is still better than the stock seat that came with my mountain bike but it still hurts. It's not soft at all. I have a bony butt hence it is important that my posterior hip bones don't dig in the seat to hard. This seat did not do it one bit. I am very disappointed in it. 20 minutes into the ride my butt hurts almost as bad as the stock seat.
3,Its ok,"At first i was in love with this seat. the standard seat that came with my schwinn sidekick was literally a pain in the you know where. i am not a small girl. being over weight there is a lot of pressure on the rear when ridding and when you ride 10 miles a day to and from work that can be a bit much. this seat was a comfortable change, however once i got used to it i find that it really isn't so great. yeah it is far more comfortable then the standard seat, but i find it is a little hard to get balanced right with it. i ether fell like i am going to fall off the front of it or i sit way back and my hips hurt when i petal. ether way i am stuck with it being working class stiff. if anyone else has this problem and you find a good seat that doesn't cost an arm and a leg give me a yell."
4,A big guy needs a big seat.,"I bought a used mountain bike from my landlord's husband. The seat on the bike was more suited to his skinny black behind,(he laughed when I told him that.) I am 6'2"" and 350lbs, all in all a very large man. I bought the bike to exercise with because I like to walk to the library every day or so, around 2.5 miles one way, and the bike would make the trip shorter. The Vitesse Cruiser bike seat makes it comfortable. It's not a huge distance but with this seat I don't get such a pain in the ... The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is even with my cousin who is 190lbs wet the seat is prone to tilt backwards suddenly. I have tightened as tight as possible without stripping the bolt. I have gotten the seat in a comfortable position and used some jb weld on it hoping that fixes the problem."
4,this is a wonderful start to all the r&b love songs... etc,"I absolutely love this group. They definitely had a great sound. I remember when body talk came out in 84'. It was my favorite to breakdance to... Two Occasions was a awesome love song that I loved skating couples to, back when roller skates weren't inlined.. Check this out....."
5,The best blues video,"I have some 10 blues videos and this is probably my favourite. It spans most of lighnin video taped recording carrer, from the 60's up to the 80's. Most of this has never been available in video and its amazing. It includes a version of Rock me baby from austin city limits that is amazing. Also includes baby scratch my back and aint it crazy. This should be in any blues video collection, and if you like lighnin, make this the first video you buy of him"
5,excellent!!!,"Im 12 years old and i think that this is an EXCELLENT CD for kids ages 0-7 even though im not that age i think its a reallllly great CD for little kids. its fun, happy, and enjoyable. BUY IT ASAP!!!"
3,More Cool than Hot and Vicious,"Starring: Tan Tao Liang, Don Wong Tao, Tommy Lee Tso-Nam (1976) (Corey Yuen Kwai as a gang villian with no fights or skills)I bought this movie because the buzz about it was so great. I was dissapointed!! While Tan Tao Liang shows his kicking power in this movie, Tommy Lee must have thought that it wouldn't be such a good Idea to showcase him or for that matter any kung fu as with most pre 1978 movies the only fight in the last 5-10 min of the film.Wang Tao was good, for the little kung fu he did as well as Tommy Lee. Its just that the amount of fighting was little and the story was very boring.It's amazing to me how people review movies based upon one the aura built around one of its stars. Tan Tao Liang is on of the greatest kickers on film, but this is not even close to being a 4 or 5 star film. Tommy Lee played what Tan and Wong reffered to as ""a yellow haired gorilla"". Lee utilized what appeared to be the ""Mantis fist technique""."
2,2 1/2 stars actually,"Well this movie was ok... No where near a classic to me. I recommend ""Challenge of Death""; it was a better movie then this one."
1,"Junk, Junk , Junk",The lighted stadium is mostly made of cardboard. It is certainly not very sturdy and not worth the price. My son has played with it once since he got it for Christmas and he is a football fanatic. It is so big it takes up my entire dining room table. You might as well through your money out the window and save yourself the worry of where to put it.
1,Electric Football board game,This game is not much of a challenge in fact not a challenge at all when the only way of winning is by pure chance. A new game needs to be invented. One where the is a real scheme involved on both sides of the ball. And one you can develop skill along with the schemes you desire. Please look for the next great football board game invention. I know they're out there and yes I do know of one.Regards David Gonzales
5,"Rock Hard, Ride Free","To me this is one of the great forgotten Metal albums of the 80's. It's very traditional, classy stuff - another of the hundreds of bands spawned in Europe in the following of the NWOBHM. Simply, Picture were one of the best and ""Diamond Dreamer"" in particular (well, at least as far as I'm concerned) is a forgotten treasure.The music in here, has a blue-collar earnestness and is not a million miles away from early Accept with a hint of Saxon (and Priest, of course) - but it's very genuine. Alias, Picture truly represents a sound common to a lot of other Dutch or Belgian bands from the era (Bodine, Killer...). I had borrowed the LP years ago and had never seen it again and just recently I tracked it down and got me an EX/EX copy. Yes!Classy stuff for all those into pure, hard, Heavy Metal."
3,A review of water distribution and wastewater,This is not a very detail review I feel. It is also the exact same text from the full Civil Engineering License Review book (the big book by Donald G. Newman). I returned this item since I already had the big book. It would be a good companion to have if you are not willing to purchase the big book and are planning on taking the Civil PE Exam.
2,Three-time loser,"This is my third such thermometer in three years. Unlike the previous two that 'died of old age,' this one has failed to function properly from day one. The two temperature readings are off by 2-4 degrees F and the clock works but tells the wrong time. My experience to date makes me think that ""Made in China"" has the same negative connotation that ""Made in Japan"" had before WW2. The indoor case looks good, is easy to read and provides illumination on demand, all good features. But one shouldn't judge by the cover."
1,lost,what dvd is this? A collection of songs by Cliff Richard in 3 discs or just three of his old movies in three discs.How to reveiw this title.
1,should have stayed beyond the border,"This book is pure pseudoscientific bunk. The publication of this book and others of its ilk is the price we pay for freedom of speech. The truly sad thing is that the real universe is thousands of times more interesting than this nonsense, yet people persist in gobbling it up. If you really want to know about the borderlands of science read Sagen's The Demon Haunted World or Morris's The Edges of Science. I should have read the reviews more carefully; fortunately I bought it used and for a very small price, still it is only good for starting a fireplace fire."
5,"Excellent, general overview of unnatural phenomenon","If you are looking for a book that picks at the details of unnatural phenomenon, alternative history, UFO's and cryptozoology, find another book.However, if you are looking for a well written, well documented book that touches upon dozens of these phenomenon, then this book is for you!From UFO's to the chupacapra, Mike Dash gives the reader just enough information to pique their interest. He also touches on subjects not normally written about or at least included in same book. For example, he writes about numerous hoaxes including Carlos Castanada's poorly written ""biographys""!If you are interested in various subjects such as UFO's and mysterious animals, then grab this book!"
3,"ALIENS, BIGFOOT, CRYPTOZOOLOGY, UFOS","It was very good and informative, I gave it 3 stars cause it jumps around a bit and starts into a subject matter, then ends abruptly and talks about the next subject, without much tie - in. Otherwise I would have gave it a 4 star. It talks about ufos, aliens, bigfoot, etc.... Paranormal- BORDERLAND subject matter."
3,It could be better,"The book isn't that bad. Its beginning is terrific, but the half and the end... The author tries to give a logical and skeptical explanation for every event he talks about. And some of his explanations aren't that good. Anyway the book is worth its price."
1,What a Joke!,"I'm glad I found this book in the library and didn't buy it! After hearing the good reviews here I was shocked at how poor this book really was. I'm a fan of the paranormal and have studied it for a long time, I am always looking for new views and info whether it be pro or con. But this book is obviously a debunking manuscript. And a poor one at that! It tackles only the weakest of cases, ignores REAL evidence, and brings forth ""rational"" explanations that are even more far out than the paranormal explanation. The section on crop circles was horrible, dismissing it as a hoax without even LOOKING AT ANY of the fascinating evidence that this is a real occurance. Pass!"
3,"OK, but Disappointing","I bought this product hoping it would be a good way to run a few non-video intensive PC games on my Macbook Air. None of the games I tried would work for any prolonged period of time. Since some of the games only require a P3 600Mhz I was sorely disappointed in this product. I did try installing a few programs on the ""compatible"" list from the developer's website such as Office XP and they worked fine. So, if you are going to only run applications that are listed as compatible from the developer then this is a fine product."
2,caution - compatibility,"I bought this product because I needed to install a specialized research program - made for Windows - on my MAC. The Cross Over Box listed on the box as ""compatible"" the particular research software - so it seemed like a secure deal. However, it turned out that Code Weavers did not allow this software to work on my computer. The website then explained that there's a distinction between ""supported"" programs and ""compatible."" The ""compatible"" ones listed on the box don't always work.The product offers lots of online support but it's not so easy to find what you need. Overall, it was not a good experience for me."
2,Doesn't Work with MS ActiveX control,"For anyone using software involving Microsoft's ActiveX control, this software does not work at all. :-\"
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased a new Mac Pro computer, read all the hype about Code Weavers' Crossover and decided to give it a try. I found Crossover practically useless: it did not run any of the popular programs I tried it with and it became a nuisance instead of an aid. This is just my opinion and as always,try it yourself to form your own opinion."
1,Unstable garbage.,"I was excited at the notion of never having to bother with Windows again, to be able to run windows/osx programs/games on my mac with no costly waste of time windows licence. By the dream ended there when I tried this horrid software. I was smart enough to try the trial before purchasing this junk because all the programs or games (Crossover games Mac) software I tried to use just crashed, were buggy as hell and had serious capability issues. I'll still with my dual boot on my Imac right now, windows for games OSX for everything else.This software does not work and it is a complete waste of money."
2,Horrible Install,"This will not fit a standard cabinet well. Most cabinets are 12 inches deep, thats standard. With the cables sticking out the back this is easily 13 and a half inches deep. Unless you want it sticking out in front (looking bad) you have to cut into your drywall as I had to.Also the width is misleading, when I bought this it was labeled as for 15 inch cabinets, when its 15 and 3/4 inches wide. Luckily our light rail bumped the width out far enough.The bolts that come with it seem to be a metric size. I needed slightly longer ones to make the install work properly (again because of the light rail) but being metric they were impossible to find.I ended up rigging it up by double laying the cabinet bottom with some 1x6 and boring into the actual cabinet bottom with a spade bit so my bolt head would sit lower.I finally got it installed, and it looks nice, but man it was a pain."
1,Doesn't fit,"I wanted this to work out SO much! The last reviewer is right - it doesn't fit standard cabinets. What, exactly, does Sony expect us to do? I have tile behind my cabinets! Even if you allowed the tv to stick out an inch from the front, there is not enough clearance to bolt it in place. They made this too big.Very Disapointed. Wait until a smaller version comes out - I am."
5,Excellent Sound and picture,This unit is a little to large to fit under a standard depth cabinet but fit under a corner cabinet with not problem. I picked this nit after comparing the picture and sound with the other available under cabinet unis. The sony is more expensie but a cut above in sound and picture quality. The sound and DVD/CD player are great. Radio reception is a little weak and I need to check with sony if there is a way to add an external antena.
1,Looks nice til you go to try and install....,"I don't understand how anyone could use this. Sony didn't consider standard cabinet sizes when they designed this?? There are 90 degree cables that you can get, but still the unit barely fits under our cabinets without any cables. Unless you mounted it in the corner or under a shelf that was extra deep, I wouldn't bother getting this. For the price, I want something that is convenient -- with the installation hassles, this was not. I ended up getting the RCA 9"" tv -- it has an undercabint mount -- AND it's a lot cheaper."
3,too bulky,"The only problem I can see so far with this TV is its size. It does not fit under a standard size cabinet and installing it required some unorthodox methods. I am happy with everything else, but had I known that it would not fit I would have chosen a different product."
1,Didn't hold,Bought to fix a speaker peeped surface and still came apart re glued 3 times same results. Ended up buying new speakers
4,Speaker glue,"I used this to fix a 14 inch base speaker. I removed the old surround and cleaned the speaker metal area with a dermal tool before I glued it back together. Glue worked well. It gets tacky after about 30 minutes and then you can make sure it is stuck down and it dries is a few hours. I glued the surround to the speaker, let it dry than glued the surround to the cone. I still had lots of glue leftover."
2,Speaker glue didn't work,"I had purchased the speaker glue to repair a small 1"" crack around the paper of the cone of my 3.5"" driver. It worked only for two days even after giving 1 day to dry initially. Then, with normal volume the crackling sound returned. I ended up purchasing a brand new driver from Polk Audio for $70."
1,Works Fine but Limited Function,"The product works fine, but has limited functionality. I agree with the other reviews which state that navigation is a little difficult. To me, the sound is fine. It's easy to set up and use. The fact that you can hook your iPod to your receiver is great. But what I don't understand is why I can't use the Bridge to access the video on my video iPod. After all, it links into a Harman Kardon audio-video receiver. The receivers handle a host of video inputs. It seems strange to say the least that the iPod's video cannot be accessed and displayed. My recommendation is not to buy it. You can get video from your iPod onto your TV by using an RCA adapter cable available through Amazon for one cent (plus $5 shipping). While you cannot control your iPod through the receiver you get far more access to its content and greater control over its display. Surely some day we'll get a product worth owning. This is not it."
5,Good product,Very good product...works like a charm. Great to be able to use a single remote to control my iPod.
3,"Integrates well with the HK receiver, but clunky to operate","It is wonderful to listen to the ipod using this dock. It integrates well with the Harmon Kardon receiver, but operating the ipod is a bit difficult. Once the ipod is in this dock, it can be operated only by using the remote for the receiver. Display is only on the receiver. Half of the ipod functionality is lost. In the absence of a better product, this is a good compromise."
4,A Nice Tool,I've been using the HK Bridge Docking Station for about three weeks. It's a great way to listen to the music in my iPod. I installed it and was listening to music in less than a minute.
3,Not a snug fit for the 1G Nano,"There are a total of 5 iPod base snap-ins to provide a good fit for most iPods, but the smallest it gets is for the Mini. If you've got a Nano, forget about it, you'll have to dock it using one of the snap-ins for a larger iPod. Not worrysome, but that would put all of the stress on the connector if it was bumped or hit.Seems like The Bridge was designed and manufactured before the Nano came out."
5,Nice features,"The conveneince of the ""Bridge"" is a great feature to compliment Harmon-Kardon receivers. The on screen videos allow you to watch videos, downloaded movies or tv shows. I definitely recommend getting the ""Bridge"" to ipods users that have HK receivers."
2,i shouldve listened!,i should've listened to micheal dooling! his reviews were right on the dot. it is a hassle to use this product. before i got the bridge i was actually doing ok with the monster rca wires. im gonna try to return the product.
4,Pretty cool but has one flaw,"I have a harman Kardon AVR 140 - You need to have one of the new Harman x40 recievers to use this product. It is pretty cool and sets up in an instant and you can control it with the HK receiver or remote. What you control is the most of the Ipod's Music menu. This means you can scroll through Playlists, Artists, Albums, Songs, Composers - but not podcasts or games. Also, you cannot shuffle the ipod. The menus that you can control work pretty good, but have a bit of delay so they are not as fast as the click wheel on the ipod. The lack of the shuffle feature is the biggest downside in my book and will force you to build up your playlists when you want variety. Sound quality is very good."
5,Well Served To Read Other Reviews.....,"Had I not read the other reviews that share tips to get around this item's shortcomings I would probably be as frustrated with this product as some of the other reviewers here. That said, after taking some time to alphabetize my 5k tracks using the genre category as a previous reviewer suggested, I can now quickly and easily navigate through my songs (note to Zappa owner - do this and you will only need to hit the forward button 26 times, not 780). The shuffle tip another reviewer suggested also works very well. IMHO, people would be better served to spend more time reading the tips in these reviews, and less time ranting about some avoidable problems.In all, I just got my HK avr240 and The Bridge and I am extremely happy with both. I just can't wait for my Athena as b1.2's and c1.2 to get here."
2,Not what I thought,"The functions are hard to use when connected to my HK amp. Also, it has temped me to leave my iPod in the docking station and now my battery doesn't hold a charge for very long."
5,It works,"It works with the older gen of Ipods, but the newer ones will play, but it doesn't charge the battery... Stupid but then again i have the older style so i'm not complaining."
4,Bridge for IPOD,"Not very user frendly with the Harman Kardon Control but it met all my expectations in terms of conecting, charging and playing my ipod with the home theather and using the same control."
3,Not the best,"I am having a difficult time keeping focused. I am not enjoying this book like I have with all the others. It is, for me hard to follow."
3,Good story,"I read it for the book club I am on. I did enjoy reading it. It is part of series I found out. After I read it I watched it and the movie based on book before it called, The Christmas Box, which put into context more the story of Timepiece. There were some good points to think about and discuss. It was a fast read."
5,Not what I expected,This book has history and love and surprise. The telling story of honor and friendship. I hope you read this book it is really a nice read.
2,Sony M-470 Microcassette Voice Recorder,I would not recommend this product. The loud buzzing noise during playback made it almost impossible to hear what was on the tape. I tried different tapes and speeds and a mic but to no avail. Digital please!
3,Clear as a bell?,"This is a very handy device to keep with you. It is compact, and easy to work with. I recorded a television show, and when I played it, the sound was very clear! Even with all things in the back ground, didn't get any interference. I just carry it with me, in a pocket or purse. Only thing is, I need longer tape (90 minutes), for school lectures. But they can be found just about anywhere. You will like it especially if you are new to micro cassette tape recorders. Great price too!"
3,Disappointed ...,"Although the recording quality is acceptable, I was very disappointed that the recorder did not have built-in jacks for external headphones and a microphone."
3,It's Ok,"This product is not bad. Useful and serves it's purpose. But you might want something with a counter, that would help alot!"
3,Nice portable voice recorder,I bought these for my Aunt and Uncle so that they could start to record some of their memories. They both found the devices easy to use and a nice size to keep handy when the mood strikes to make a recording.
2,Sony Micro-Cassette Recorder,"I knew not to expect a lot of volume from this small recorder, but so far I've not been happy with my recordings because they are difficult to hear. I have used new batteries, checked the volume control, but the recordings are still poor. My good sense keeps the recorder from finding a home in the trash can."
4,Excellent Little Machine,Easy to use. Sound quality is fine. Noise cancellation okay. Easy to carry. Nice little product.
5,excellent,"After returning two less expensive microcassette recorders, I bought this one. It performs very well -- good sound and well designed."
3,Okay for basic use.,This is my first small recorder so I don't have a basis for comparison. I bought it to record my own brief observations as I walk through and survey the development where I live. It's adequate for that but the sound is not as clear as I had hoped it would be and there is quite a bit of background noise (not from the environment). I question whether it would be adequate to record a lecture or music but for the price and my purpose it's okay.
4,Playing old and new tapes,I had some old (very) of my wife's grandmother and also her Dad. Never though we would get to hear the tapes again. It worked well and I will probably make a CD of their voices for our grandchildren. It works very well.
5,Much needed Message for Today's Recreation minded Christian,"Are you having problems focusing and gettings things accomplished? Stop making excuses and get this book!As the author himself states:""Discipline is what moderns need the most and want the least."" I would also say that this is a great book for high school graduates, Young Pastors and anyone needing help living a disciplined life.It is Basically in two Parts. My favorite chapter is found in the first part of the book: ""Discipline and Holiness"" which the author(very persuasively)shows are not synonomous.Part 2 of the book: ""The Path to discipline in Christian living"" offers excellent teaching and practical advice on how to achieve a life of discipline.Worth it's weight in Gold!"
3,It is good movie for Rajesh Khanna's fan,"This movie revolves around the lives of two brothers, Kishan (Amol Palekar) and Shambhu (Rajesh Khanna). Kishan is married to Shanti (Raakhee), but both are unable to have children. When Tulsi (Rekha) and her blind mother come to live in the same village, Shambhu falls in love with her. Tulsi is the cousin of Jaggan (Prem Chopra) who does not like Tulsi and Shambhu together and plots to separate them. Jaggan creates false rumors about Shanti and Shambhu having an affair, and as a result Kishan decides to marry again - to Tulsi -at the suggestion of Jaggan, and divorces Shanti. Will this controversy ever be resolved? Will Shambhu and Tulsi marry?"
3,Chick Lit,"Reads more like a screen play than a novel...Thinly developed characters,intriguingplot line, lots of witty banter but never achieves any true psychological depth... Althoughthe story is a sad one the author uses humour to tell the story of two lovers brought togetherby a high school reunion which neither attends....San Francisco is the backdrop and anyonewho knows that city will enjoy the intimate glimpses of certain neighborhoods....A good readbut don't expect great literature."
1,mindless and poorly written,"If you are looking for a mindless Harlequinn Romance, I would recommend this book. If you are looking for decent literature, don't even pick this one up. The plot is thin. I found myself rolling my eyes at the dialog as well as the many stupid situations that (I'm sure) were supposed to be gripping."
5,A powerful story of sadness and redemption.,"Ultimately a moral tale of deep spirtual and emotional impact. The three principal characters, Blair, Amanda and Luke are each faced with defining choices: Blair how to provide for Amanda, the sixteen year old daughter that is the center of her life as Blair is dying. Amanda whether to try to insulate and protect her mom (and their relationship) during the last year of life or to allow Blair to explore love that she has forgone to raise her daughter. Luke to return to the prodigal wife who reappears with her own compelling secret, or to immerse himsef in a love that has been 25 years in the making. In the end there are no miracles but there is hope for lives well lived. Sussman's clear and unsentimental prose, wonderfully drawn characters (including a prescient pooch) and sense of compassion for the flaws of her three protagonists make this a must read for the season."
4,Traveling In Grandma's Day,"Patty Baker was born in 1941 in Alaska. Growing up in a military family meant lots of travel. Because of World War II, they were evacuated to the lower 48. To get to her father's relatives in Texas she went by boat, train, and car. When her family was stationed in Turkey she went by plane. At that time, very few people flew. It took over three days to get from New York City to Turkey. I particulary found the information about flying to be the most interesting. Its changed so much. ""In Grandma's Day "" series is a great way to look back at history on a personal level."
5,PLEASE enjoy this outstanding BD,"There is nothing wrong with the audio for this BD, to the contrary it is quite exceptional.In fact the PCM 5.1 is so detailed in clarity and representation of all the musicians involved that I bet those watching from the front row will say they never experienced the concert's sound as clear as this. My Yamaha-Definitive Technologies Home Theater setup is having a blast playing this BD.Please all you Billy Joel haters, go somewhere else with your clearly misguiding comments. Due to some not very objective reviews, I was almost spoiled the chance to enjoy one of the very best concerts I own in terms of sound, visuals and material."
2,"good video/audio, lousy singing","like so many, i'm a huge billy joel fan. but his voice is just so off in this one (lots of sharp/flat notes) that it's hard to watch/listen.some parts with the duets with others are fun though, but overall, very disappointed."
5,ABSOLUTE MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!,"After watching the"" Last play at Shea"" documentary dvd tonight and being at that awesome show myself I'll be definitely getting this on bluray the second it comes out. What a thrill it was to see Roger Daultrey, Steven Tyler, Tony Bennett and Garth Brooks perform that night- and what can I say about my main man Billy himself?- in a word-GREAT!, and when Sir Paul came out at the end to sing ""Let it be""- it was the perfect ending to a night that I'll never forget. You'd be an absolute fool not to buy this!."
2,Disappointing sound,The comments on the poor sound quality are spot on - I've bought many Blu-ray concerts and the overwhelming majority have immersive sound quality that really are fantastic. The 5 channel PCM mix is terrible - zero depth of sound and no balance between instruments and vocals - and zero bass punch. The 2 channel mix is a bit better but still not up to the standards that many other Blu-rays achieve.I REALLY hope this can be salvaged - great filming and great show - it is a shame the sound is so messed up
2,Too Many Songs Left Out,"I was surprised to see so many songs left out -- he played almost identical set lists both nights (with the exception of what was done with special guests), so why not include all the songs... Songs played, but not included: Innocent Man, Root Beer Rag, Downeaster Alexa, Big Shot, Still Rock and Roll to Me, Big Man on Mulberry Street, Don't Ask Me Why, Souvenir. Would love to know why these were not included..."
1,"BEWARE: Great Show, Bad Disc!","The release date was pushed apparently due to a bad audio mix on the blu-ray version.Best Buy in Los Angeles doesn't seem to know this as they put out the bad discs on the original street date.I have one and Billy's vocals as well as the backup vocals are all pushed to the front. This happens in 5.1, and 5.1 PCM.Make sure you have the newly authored disc.5 stars for the content1 star for the audioUPDATED ON 4/6/2011It seems they new nothing about the BAD AUDIO mix because it's not fixed.AUDIO IS STILL BAD! THE BLU-RAY RELEASED THIS WEEK IS ALSO BAD! DO NOT BUY UNTIL IT'S FIXED!AND why would they sleight the very consumers who are keeping home video alive by upgrading to Blu-Ray by not including the CDs??!!??!!The whole thing stinks and I'm upset because I LOVE ME SOME BILLY JOEL!!!!!Thanks for reading the rant.Larry64"
2,Please fix mix,"This is an outstanding concert. Billy Joel is indeed a master musician/songwriter. His band is the best although like many others, I do miss Liberty, but this drummer is a close equal. But I must agree with Capt RB and K Morris. The mix must be fixed. This Blu-ray should be a cherished record of a great career. Instead, those who have spent a fortune on high end gear have trouble listening to it. I have many concert DVDs and Blu-rays by artists I don't revere as much as Billy Joel, and their mixes make this pale by comparison. I am waiting for someone to come clean and release the corrected version. I will gladly buy it."
5,Loved it!!,"My first Billy Joel concert I have seen on dvd, regardless I loved it. The picture quality is amazing... I didnt not notice any bad sound qualities. Happy with my purchase."
4,Editing at its finist,"Well the quality is superb, however as someone who went to the Final Night I know that there was some major editing done. First off the track order is totally out of whack, and at times it seems as if Billy's voice is in a different key than what I remember and have heard via the bootlegs. Overall it is a great recording, all be it edited recording, of this historic event with perhaps the best american singer/songwriter of the last 30 years."
2,Weird vocal performance!!,"Let me preface by saying that the primary reason we bought this concert DVD was, we were so impressed by Billy Joel's performance at the Sandy benefit concert. He was amazing at that concert, so we assumed he would be equally great at this concert, which was recorded in 2008. Wrong!!! The vocals were odd and frankly unpleasant, one viewing was enough, we gave the DVD away!!! Maybe there's a great Billy Joel performance DVD out there, but this ain't it!!"
5,Memorable,"This is a great concert and a wonderful DVD. It documents the career of Billy Joel and the timeline of Shea Stadium - both New York legends. So fitting somehow that Billy Joel was the last great concert held in that grand stadium. Even more fitting, perhaps, is that Sir Paul McCartney made a surprise last minute appearance, since the Beatles made their first US appearance in Shea! This is a very enjoyable concert with great guests in addition to Billy Joel. If you're a music fan, a baseball fan or just grew up somewhere in the 50's-70's, you'll love having this DVD in your collection!"
4,Why?,"I am sure that this will be a great concert to watch on DVD (Blu-ray no less), but I just want to know why this package does not include the CDs of the show as well? It appears that you have to purchase the standard DVD in order to get the CDs. Not good in my book."
1,I want a refund,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible........ Sub par performance, with off key singing and playing. Didn't seem to get ready for such a large venue. Now the Blu-ray Disc is disgraceful. This is absolutely the worst sounding Disc I have in my collection (Blu-ray and non Blu-ray). There is no Bass management and everything is pushed towards the middle speaker. Just to get to an acceptable listening, you'll have to turn off the surround sound and listen to it in Stereo. They need to fix this disc and send everyone who bought it a revised copy or at least refund my money."
3,His Time is gone!!!,"I am from Germany and Billy Joel is my All-Time-Hero!!! BUT(and it breaks my heart to say this) his Time is gone. When I think of ""songs in the attic"" or ""live from long island"" this is just terrible. His Voice is actualy embarrassing and his pianoplaying just slow. Was he drunked?!He was the best but these days the NEW Billy Joel ist Jamie Cullum.dude"
2,Bad voice!,All I can say is one thing. His voice is really bad in this concert. If you can live with it then the back up and band is better than he is at the time he sang. I agree with one about thinking the man was drunk. You just don't have a concert like this and sound like that. Also the DVD comes in your not so standard case. Something like a clear CD case. The hard plastic kind and the middle hub was broke and we know what that could mean. A DVD that has moved during shipment and scratched a new DVD all to heck. I know they can do better than this as well as Billy with his voice. Its time to retire and remember the good ol days when the pipes worked flawlessly. I give it two stars just because his voice is bad threw the whole concert.
2,More Cashing in For Sony/Joel,"How many more ways can we make a buck rehashing and repackaging the same material? That seems to be the extent of creativity going on in the Joel camp this past DECADE. Same songs, played the same way, pretty much in the same order for the past 15-18 years. The documentary is much more interesting, the new Legacy edition release of Piano Man at least contains a vintage live performance."
5,Music Videos,"Buying George Jones music video was a great experiance. Looking for the video was easy and making the purchase was a breeze. The video was great quality and enjoyed watching it. I will be buying all of my music videos this way because it was easy, a great deal, and time saving."
5,"""A must have""","Now this is REAL COUNTRY MUSIC, thru and thru.The presentation, sound and color is great.The words that Vince Gill had to say about George says it all.A real treasure to be able to sit and listen for 2 hours.GREAT VALUE from Amazon.I also purchased ""NEVER SAY DIE"" the final concert of WAYLON JENNINGS & THE WAYMORE BLUES BAND.It features his wife Jessie Colter in several songs.It's a Box Set, well worth the money.DVD(running time 2 hours) and 2 CD'sDon't pass up this opportunity.Also purchased WAYLON JENNINGS LIVE FROM AUSTIN,TEXAS recorded April 1, 1989.Features 17 great songs taken from the full concert with great color and sound. It's56 minutes."
2,bad sync,"The content is great. The sound is beautiful. The photography is colorful and crisp. But... the video is incredibly poorly synced with the sound, and this is throughout the dvd and variable from second to second. I just glance up at the screen from time to time while listening."
4,Great Variety,A great group of artists singing great songs in their own way. A wonderful tribute to one of the greats.
3,It's so difficult to be a consistant jingo in a world market.,"If you bought this because you ""only buy American"", guess again. You're profoundly mistaken. This is another fine Szechwan product brought to you with an American Logo stamp. In fact, if you subscribe a service similar to this one, [...] , you'll discover that WARN, like its competition, is a branded assembly aggregator, the 21st century's new manufacturing business model, enabled by international capital, containerized shipping, and free, flexible, open markets."
3,Not completely USA made,"I just ordered this, and while the receiver is made in the USA, the d-ring is stamped China (the Amazon photo shows a USA stamped d-ring). I called Warn to verify, and they state that all of their d-rings are now made in China.For the price it would be nice to see a full USA made shackle bracket, but the quality of this is still better than the previous CSI shackle I had."
5,WE LOVE YOU MAYA!,"They have finaly released season 2 of this great show.Maya is so hot! The music is so great. Martin Laundau is the best actor to ever star in a sci-fi show, no wonder he won that award for Ed Wood. I am in a hurry to watch The Bringers of Wonder episode which has a story very simular to The Matrix. Space 1999 was so ahead of its time, after watching these episodes I now know were Star Trek The Next Generation gets most of its ideas, not from the original Star Trek! Hop on board Moonbase Alpha everyone for the trip of a lifetime!!!!!!!!"
2,"Prints, Scans and Copies well - ink is a huge problem","Here are the facts, you decide if you'd tolerate this:-After 6 weeks the blank ink was low and the others were about 40%.-I replaced the black and all the others suddenly showed that they were also empty (although I didn't print anything in between the time black was low and replacing and I rarely print in color.)-To replace all cartridges with genuine EPSON products is about $90, I went to 5 large office retailers before I found out COMPUSA is the only retail location that had all colors available.-After replacing all catridges, I received an error message that the cartridges could not be recognized.-Epson help desk troubleshooted and then informed me that this is ""a known problem"". Epson offered to fedex a new printer. I declined figuring I didn't want to have the same issue next time I had to replace cartridges.-The scanning is great, printing is easy to use."
1,BEWARE - FULL SCREEN - Rating the FORMAT not the MOVIE,"Any of the reviews here from people who rated the MOVIE as 5 STARS I COMPLETELY agree with... HOWEVER, I bought and RETURNED this dvd because it was FULL SCREEN. There is NO WAY that this format or version, or whatever you want to call it can be justified in this day and age. WIDESCREEN or LETTERBOX are the ONLY WAY TO GO. And for those who like full screen (why?????) great, but Amazon should at least offer the WIDESCREEN for those of us who ONLY ENJOY THAT FORMAT.I hear other ""vendors"" offer the widescreen version, which I will now purchase, but I would like to have been able to do this through Amazon.THE MOVIE ITSELF IS INCREDIBLY AND BRILLIANTLY FUNNY AND WELL DONE!"
3,The Road to Wellville is Paved with Good Intentions,"But the jokes often fall shy of the mark. I mean really, how many intercourse and scatology gags can a person take in two hours? The novel was ribald, to say the least, but the cinmatic realization goes beyond necessary. I don't remember so many bodily functions in the novel. While this is the film's own particular problem, the movie does share some faults with the book, too - they're both overly long for the available subject matter, they're both a bit too wordy, and the subject that they share - whatever it is- is a little muddled. On the plus side, good costumes and period reconstructions; good music. No doubt the director meant well, but his point seems to have got lost along the way."
2,"Uneven, not for anyone, and not good","A friend I really respect showed me this film. I can see how a bright person may like the film: it is a look at a semi-interesting topic, the wellness cults of Kellog's day, and in the right hands could have been an interesting commentary on health nazis of today. Instead the film becomes a scatological nightmare, with incredibly uneven pacing and confused plot(s) that end in a very dissapointing ending. The performances range from mildly interesting (Hopkins as Kellog) to pathetic (Dana Carvey as Kellogs adopted ne'er do well son). If you like endless poop jokes, the film is for you. If you think fanantics are wacky you'll like it too. Then again, even if you fit in the above categories you probably still will not like this flop."
4,An absolutely hilarious movie.,"This movie was absolutely hilarious. The character development could have been better, and the pacing was a little awkward at times (other people who have seen the movie claimed to be a little confused), but other than that, this movie was incredibly funny. There's a lot of throw-away jokes here, all of the hit or miss variety, but the jokes work more often than not, so I found myself convulsing with laughter more than once during the course of the movie. Highly enjoyable!"
4,How's your health?,"Once again Anthony Hopkins takes his character over the top and into a hilarious trip into Battle Creek Michigan as the infamous Dr. John Kellog. Who cares if the story doesn't stick to the novel's, its simply non-stop comical sequences, peppering the eyes as one sits back and either shrieks in delight or is both appalled and embarrassed by the goings on. You'll never look at a doctor or nurse the same way again."
1,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA","Remember that song in the film? Very catchy. I love this film. It's well cast, filmed and acted. But I'm giving this dvd only 1 star for these reasons: #1 - it is NOT presented in widescreen (it was filmed in 1.85:1). #2 - the HORRIBLE dvd box art, which looks like a bootleg edition you'd snag off the streets with the cheap looking design and ugly title font. #3 - ZERO EXTRAS and for THAT price?!?!. It's an outrage. This is a horrible edition. Lucky for me I have the laserdisc which IS in widescreen."
1,Hope,"Unable to play due to Region 2. Unaware of different regions until now, lesson learned. Need more description of what regions are."
2,Not recommended!,"This movie capitalizes on the sexual content in the book.Set in an authentic time and place, the book is purely fictional entertainment and twists the history of Battle Creek Sanitarium at the start of the 20th century. The movie is much worse than the book! Both are weighted with adult content.NEITHER OF THESE TWO ARE RECOMENDED!!!"
4,Reeking of pork...,"This movie is a ribald and hilarious send-up of late nineteenth century ideas regarding health and how to maintain it. The unrelenting focus on exercise, clean bowels, vegetarianism, and holier-than-thou dogma propagators like Hopkins' Dr. Kellogg are eerily mirrored by today's focus on exercise, fiber, phytochemicals, and the ""infomercial experts"" propagating the diet and exercise culture of late-night cable TV. Watch this movie and think of it as the start of a great national industry. And eat a pork chop while you do it."
5,"The Flakes aren't in your bowl, they're the Doctors telling you to eat","Hilarious neglected comedy by a star ensemble cast. But perhaps it isn't as funny if you do not know the real story behind the Battle Creek Sanatorium craze and the various circuses of peripheral quacks it attracted. This was a dim era for science and a bizarre pause in America's ongoing love of the latest ""health craze."" Who knows, perhaps the liquid crystal enemas of today will end up being the Kellogg's Corn Flakes of tomorrow."
2,Very off beat film with many famous actors,"This film is very ""different"" and I feel safe in saying the average viewer has not seen anything like it before. Anthony Hopkins is good as always, outfitted with some fake buck teeth, playing the very eccentric Dr. John H. Kellogg. The movie as the book it is taken from is a very fictionalized version of the real life Dr. Kellogg and his vegetarian ""sanitarium"" at Battle Creek, Michigan. You may wonder why a movie about a vegetarian health spa in Michigan in the late 1800's needs to be rated R. Trust me there is more than enough nudity and frank sexual and scatological talk to justify the rating. Many famous and familiar performers have parts in this movie including Bridget Fonda, Matthew Broderick, Camryn Manheim, Dana Carvey, and John Cusack. The costumes and sets are lovely but the movie doesn't seem to know where it is going and is not a must see unless you are a true fan of one or more of the actors."
5,"Extremely Funny, if you with a Sense of Humour!","I've never seen so many intellectual type reviews from people who were so obviously born without a sense of humour. For heavens sake, whether it follows the book, or not, this is a hillarious movie by most standards. Unfortunately, some people choose to take these things too seriously, and base their judgements upon things which don't concern the average person: who seeks entertainment and a laugh. This is a comedy - not a boring drama! - and once you accept the fact, it's a great film!"
4,How's your health?,"Once again Anthony Hopkins takes his character over the top and into a hilarious trip into Battle Creek Michigan as the infamous Dr. John Kellog. Who cares if the story doesn't stick to the novel's, its simply non-stop comical sequences, peppering the eyes. You'll either shriek in delight or be appalled or embarrassed by the goings on. It's the health spa we would've all saved up for and visited if we were around at the time, even if the trip were made to just watch instead of take part. Not for the immature."
5,"Non-stop laughs, fantastic musical score, Alan Parker again!","""The Road"" is highly entertaining from the opening scene to the all-too-sudden end.The cast, script, editing, direction, and musical score all epitomize Alan Parker's unparalleled creative genious. Every element of this movie deserves close attention, which is what makes it worth watching over and over...I show this movie to friends who have no idea what they are in store for (WHY didn't this movie get more acclaim???). It always gets fantastic reviews, and that is what you will experience, too.You will love this one!"
4,"Hilariously historical, but not letterboxed","The film itself is hilariously funny, for those who have an open mind and heart on the subject of body functions. However -- beware! This DVD boasts as one of its ""special features"" the fact that it's a FULL SCREEN version, not a letterboxed version. I doubt there will ever be another DVD edition, so pick it up, anyway. The film wasn't shot in 'scope, so it's hard to tell how much you're missing -- either you're losing a small amount from the sides, or you're actually gaining a little on the top and bottom. Anyway, a five-star feature goes down to four because of the unwise choice of a ""full screen"" presentation."
1,Awful~ I'd Give it less if I could,"I saw this at a video rental store and said, ""Wow, look at all these great people in it this must be good."" I was wrong. The people in this movie are amazing, and the story isn't bad, but its not a comedy. It's not a drama either. It really is just nothing. The cast strives to do as much with the film as possible, but its not worth it. And how can you put Dana Carvey in a role that isn't even funny?"
5,Funny Film,I have always enjoyed this film a great deal. It really tickles the fully bone or in some cases nibbles. Matthew Broderick is great and I can't figure out how he was able to keep a straight face during the making of the flick. I actually doubt if anyone kept a straight face. It's a riot and the best part about the funny part is ALL the contraptions and medical proceedures including manipulating one's uterus are actually true!
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I purchased this formula as a gift for my sister. After what seemed like a very lengthy delivery period the formula still had not arrived. I have made two attempts to contact the seller and have not heard back... I am beginning to think that the Bayou Mom store is a SCAM, and will be reaching out to Amazon for assistance."
1,Still waiting...,I made my order almost a month ago and it hasn't arrived yet. 1-2 weeks for delivery is WRONG!!! Maybe they are being cautious because of the particles the previous reviewer mentioned...
1,I don't get it!!!,"This really isn't such a great deal...the price is almost exactly the same as buying it can by can. I ordered a case because I have twins, and we're going through formula so quickly. I am disappointed with the shipping time. When I ordered this item it showed as available, and now they're saying they can't ship till June. That's three months from now!!! I'm sorry, but this is just unacceptable!"
2,"Great Formula, Not so Great Price...go to Costco or Sam's....","This is a great formula if you baby takes to it. The pricing on Amazon is indeed the best one I've found online, but you can get the same amount of formula (6 of these cans almost exactly equals 4 of the warehouse size)at Costco or Sam's Club for $116 plus sales tax. Less if you have manufacturer's checks. If you really need home delivery, or don't want to pay for a warehouse membership, this is a good option, but otherwise, pass on this."
4,Great addition for the young rock tumbler.,"We purchased this item as an add on to the rock tumbler we purchased for our Grandson. He is very excited about his newly found hobby, and quickly ran out of the rocks that came with the tumbler. Having the refill kit allowed him to continue his hobby without interruption. He has already ordered a second refill kit from the same seller. Great product."
5,Rock Tumbler,"Shipped quickly. I bought this for a friend as a gift. She is loving it. Just after two powder cycles, the rocks came out beautiful and smooth."
3,Refill kit for rock tumbler,This kit worked grate with my tumbler. It had everything I needed. I only wish it had more than 1 small packet of each of the grinding dust.
5,Fun but time consuming,This is a very creative project for kids. I didn't know until we opened it that the entire process takes weeks to complete so I can't tell you what the end product is like yet. We're still on the 2nd stage of spinning which takes 2 weeks.
5,This is the essential masterpiece we have longed for!,'Lust For Blood' is the album that cements Bryan's master attention to details and textures to his range of influences. This album is remarkably cunning and a powerful listening experience. Each track is a sonic experience that moves through many levels. Each album Bryan creates is an edification in sound. They mystify and dig into your guts in wicked ways! 'Lust' is an expanse of beautiful noise and fortified angst. Velvet Acid Christ will curdle your blood and exploit your dance moves in ways you might have thought not possible.I have one grand wish to make! Would love to hear and see these songs played live Bryan! One day...we can all hope!
5,A book that changed my life,"I borrowed this book in 1966 from a friend because I liked the cover of the old 1950s British edition. It changed my life, just as it caused James P. Cannon and other leaders of the US Communist movement who accidentally received a copy in 1928 to launch a struggle for Trotsky's ideas. Let it change yours. Workers and farmers parties in the USA, the revolution in China, how to fight fascism, the world economy and politics, all of these things are discussed, not abstractly, but as a defense of what Lenin and the original Comintern had given the workers of the world, what Stalin tried to take away. The ideas and lessons are needed in today's fights."
3,Nothing Special,"This debut reads just like many debuts--an OK book with few good bits, but also a lot of muck. This book could have used a little more editorial attention, both in terms of helping a young writer find a slightly less contrived voice, but also in catching some of the incorrect word usages scattered in the book. The tale of a lonely young girl growing up in a household with a manic-depressive mother, overburdened father, and incredibly smart and unfriendly sister works at capturing some of the confusion of that age. However, it could have been done equally well without some silly semi-magical realist elements (like the protagonists two antennae). It's OK, but nothing special, and nowhere near the level of Meera Syal's outstanding novel with a somewhat similar theme, Anita and Me."
1,A Waste of Time,"I know it must be quite a temptation, but a book's editors ought to refrain from putting in their two cents on the reader comments page. The language in the other review is just way too book industry to be believed. Moving On: I grabbed this book and cracked it open with much enthusiasm, only to be greatly disappointed. Peres da Costa's shallow, underdeveloped novel is hardly worth the read. Magical realism? What, those disposable and irrelevant feelers on the top of Mina's head? The story was boring, and by the time I got to the end, I knew what to expect -- a great fireball to end a nothing, nowhere plot. This book lacks depth and character development, and it's too bad these 300 pages couldn't have gone to a young writer with something genuinely interesting to say."
2,"Good album, boring DVD","I was impressed with the Born Again album, which is Warrant's 1st since the departure of singer/writer Jani Lane. This DVD contains a video for each song on the Born Again album as well as some extras.The bottom line here is that the videos are amateurish. I've seen wedding videos that had better production than this DVD. Every video is basically the same thing with some random images flown in. Quality-wise, it looks like someone had a camcorder and some no-frills video editing software.Two words come to mind: low budget. I still like the album, though."
1,warrant,"Para falar a verdade comprei esse dvd achando que seriam os melhores clipes da banda,mas sao musicas apenas do cd born again .....e nao gostei."
2,Aloha Sahara !,"For those with Eighteenth Century ears to hear, Boccherini is a marvellous composer. At his best, he imbues a sultry melancholy. His music never sweats.His Sextets are not exactly thick on the ground. They are wonderful, life-affirming works. Sadly, this Harmonia Mundi issue is a half-survey. Worse still, it is militated by some of the driest, most academic music-making you will ever hear this side of the Black Stump. Even Father Melchizedek OP, the High Priest of Period Practice, might withhold his imprimatur from fear of dehydration. It inculcates HIP at its most deadening, not least in its clipped phrasing and the vinegary tone. Strange: Ensemble 415 are so enjoyable inQuintets With Double-Bass. What compelled them to march into the desert like Cambyses' army?I so want to like this disc. Simultaneously I abjure desertification. What is a man to do?"
1,Max Payne-ful,"Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in a very long time.A confused mess of pathetic acting, gigantic plot holes and non-existent direction. Fans of the original game should prepare themselves to be *very* disappointed. Anyone else who has any appreciation for movies will just be bored or turn this disgrace off.Who cast this movie?Mark Wahlberg as Max Payne??Mila Kunis as a vengeful chick with a machine gun??Who are they kidding?As for the action, there is virtually zero. ""Bullet time"" was key in the game and yet it is seen in maybe one pointless scene and Max isn't the one doing the shooting....Avoid this disaster and make your life an extra 2 hours longer."
2,Unfaithful interpretation of an Amazing video game experience!,"This review is for the film. Max Payne is one of the best video games ever created and this film takes bits and pieces of the game's excellent writing and ruins what could have been an amazing movie. Mark Wahlberg does not help matters, at all!"
2,Predictable and bad,"Look..there is enough juice in this movie to watch it and some people will find it entertaining but when something is so obvious 15 minutes into the movie, really bothers me.ok..spoiler alert. The fact that they casted Beau Bridges as the lead bad guy was a complete giveaway. I knew it the minute i saw him. Why cast such a predictable actor? He plays roles like this often. Sure enough, by the end of the movie i was right."
2,paynefull to watch,"This drug fueled vision of violence is big on style and falls short in almost every other way. The suspension of disbelief in this film is over the top; by the end of the movie I was laughing to see our hero full of bullets but still alive. Kind of like the movie itself. These video-games-to-movies struggle hard, but seldom work and that's because unlike comic books that have a cohesiveness to their world, video games' very appeal rests upon the game participants differing interactions to finish the story. As a game player, we are the main character of the video contest. Here, the story is already completed for us, so it's really all about how well the writers relate the protagonist to their audience, and this one, like most, by no means has a universal appeal. So one star for Mark Wahlberg & Mila Kunis' acting and another star for style, but even that's being generous."
1,Don't give it a chance,"I hoped that by the end it would all make sense. It never does as the end is just a shoot fest, which is done well, but never makes any sense of the movie."
4,Pretty Good,"This movie in my opinion wasn't that bad.I saw it with my boyfriend(who of course loved it)I kind of liked it too.Its totally a guy movie.If you liked Sin City,300,and/or Underworld then you would like this movie 100 percent.Its along those same lines with the action and the video game/comic book feel to it.I didn't love the movie but I liked it and it would be something to add to my collection without a doubt.Its interesting and it just basically a movie made for all those hard core video gamers or any typical guy."
4,Much better than people say,"The Bottom Line:A stylish and innovative adaptation of the classic third person shooter, Max Payne was unfairly mauled by critics when in fact it's a visual treat of a thriller that could have admittedly used a better villain (why they changed the main antagonist from the game I don't know) and more on location filming in New York City but otherwise delivers as much as could be hoped for.3/4"
4,Worth the 4$ - you might want to watch again though..,"I watched this movie on a plane, missed out on last 10 min and that made me watch the whole movie again on Amazon. It is that good. There are Arnold Schwarzenegger moments in there, enjoy them, take in the mostly ongoing action. This movie makes you want to be Max at the end. I'd like to be Max. Links in a way to Boondock Saints. Destroy all that is evil."
2,ehh-,"I did manage to stay awake for the entire movie, however I kept asking myself why. I wish I could have bought the DVD so that I could sell it and get ALL my money back."
2,Drags some,"Wahlberg is good. The snow floating down through 95% of the movie makes for good ambience. Some of the action scenes are very good. The supporting caste iss good. The main problems of the movie are the pacing and the plot holes. The movie is not logically consistent in its own universe. Everybody has the same hallucinations on the drug. Beau Bridges's character confesses to killing Payne's wife; however, we see the killer scamper through a bedroom window through flashbacks. I don't think Beau could ever move that fast.Some scenes in the movie are really cool. When Max takes the drug, the snowflakes turn into flaming cinders. The shootout in the office building is done very well.In summary, don't pay too much to see this and be prepared to wonder if the movie is really worth your time."
3,Max Payne,"I can imagine the gamers are disappointed, but so are those unfamiliar with it. The game is addictive, but the movie just seems like another one about drug addicts. Mark Wahlberg is okay but he really doesn't know how to make a character have depth. If they had used Clive Owen or Jason Statham I think they probably could have done a better job of pulling us into the movie. Beau Bridges didn't exactly wow me as the bad guy either. The other thing is the movie didn't seem to know if it wanted to be a real life detective story or a ""Sin City"" wannabe. So rent it but certainly don't buy it. I had a lot of trouble getting the Blu-ray version to play. This is the first Blu-ray DVD I have had a problem with out of at least a hundred. Some extras but low replayablity. If you like this catchThe Punisher [Blu-ray].CA Luster"
1,Very disappointed,"The art direction is wonderful. Walhberg is cool. Everything else sucks. The story is full of loopholes as expected. No big deal. The main problem is the sheer absence of action. The villains are just so weak. In short, dont waste your valuable time and money on it, not even on rental."
3,Pretty good dark film,"This movie was pretty dark. There is an excellent creepy vibe to the movie that is hard pull off. It works with color and the harsh realities of the character Max. He is a tortured person. with having his wife and newborn slashed up by junkies. And he is trying to find out who the killer is. There are some typical themes like evil shady corporation, tough chick with an attitude and die hard lead character. But It works because of the pacing of the film. Wahlburg is a poor actor. But he does have his moments. He did a good job in the underrated The Happening and does some good stuff here too. He literally goes insane near the end of the film. A few moments of his mind just shattering is one his finer moments of his career. You should watch the film just to see him go crazy. It's that good. I recommend this slick film. Also I didn't even no it was a video game until after I saw it. Probably wouldn't have watch it if I known that before."
2,What happened.....?,I am a big fan of the video game and Mark W. but this movie was tough to follow at best. Some great action and some good cinematography but beyond that it was choppy and made no sense. If you can watch for free and you liked the game like me I'd watch it otherwise don't waste your time and money.
2,Not very original or Interesting,"I didn't find Max Payne very interesting and thought the script was just kind of weird. The movie really did not make much sense to me and could not get into it. Don't get me wrong, Mark Walberg is a fine actor but this is not one of his better films.Peter J. Miller"
2,I was hoping for better,"I don't know why, maybe because 2008 was such a good year for movies, I was hoping Max Payne might be fun. After all I usually like Wahlberg in action movies, and after the terribleThe HappeningI figure he owes us one. Unfortunately, Max Payne might be a fun video game, but as a movie it seemed to lack quite a bit.Here's the deal,Taste is relative, but I did not enjoy this film much and really can't recommend it. Unless you really have some time you don't mind wasting and want a dark and violent video game brought to life.1 *"
3,Not too bad but location didn't make any sense,"This is based on a video game so I wasn't expecting much and I got a little more than not much. The storyline is not so bad. However, I have a gripe, something that was bugging me throughout the movie. What NYC are these scenes being based on? I mean where in NYC is there no traffic and relative isolation. For the most part most of the scenes in this film only had the characters in the movie- WTH? Most films based in NY have the scenery right, so if you have never been to NYC most films get it right- yes its that populated, and that heavily trafficked thus the city that never sleeps. Even in the suburban areas of this city, to walk for blocks with no one else around????? This was especially ludicrous for the scenes whose background was Manhattan. I'm guessing they didn't want to spend money on extras but s-it. They should have chosen another local."
1,Really bad,"I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. Prior to order this DVD, I read all the reviews in here and decided I would give it a go.Only after watching half-way through of the movie, I realise what a fool I am. I really don't know how this movie could make it to 4-stars in here.Don't waste your time, your expectation and your money in this moive.Any other movies done by Mark Wahlberg is better than this one.One-star for Mark Wahlberg and really, what a shame."
2,much pain,IT was just plain terrible. I can't say much more. Mila Kunis was not very good in this role. She should stick to sitcoms and voice overs.
3,Average movie,Video games do not do well as movies. and this is one reason why. JJust a another shoot em up film. One person they hype up does nothing and dies. Video game is way better. Mark Walberg is the same as he is in all his movies. Nothing speacial about this. Skip it if you have too.
3,Not close to the video game.,It was not a bad movie but it was not a great movie either. If I had thought it would be close to the movie it would have had a lower star count.
3,It was ok!,"Really keep hoping for another Shooter out of Mark Walberg, but unless it's my imagination, he really seems to be playing the same role...with slight variations...in each one of his movies."
2,Max Lame?,"This is a bad movie, but what did I expect?The acting is fine. Wahlberg, Bridges, Ludacris, Kunis, and the others do a creditable job.And of course the EFFECTS are smashing. But, it would seem, the better the special effects of a movie, the lamer the movie usually is. See ""The Phantom Menace."" Or if you have any sense, don't see it.But the writing is atrocious.This is to be expected. After all, it derives from a video game.But it is disheartening to see such acting and money wasted on such pretentious claptrap. IMDB has a spoiler-alert on their synopsis, but they hardly need it. You can see this ending coming 20 miles out.The only good thing about the writing is the ""circling"" from the first scene, in the water, to the (almost) last. But even that is cheesified at the end."
1,Mark Wahlberg SUCKS !!!!!!!!!,"Mark Wahlberg has ruined more movies than any actor or actress I can think of...With the possible exception of Sharon Stone !!! Rock Star, Fear, Shooter...I could go on and on. Only The brilliant direction of Martin Scorsese and the awesome performances from Leo DeCaprio and Jack Nicholson kept him from ruining ""The Departed"" !!! He's still ""Marky Mark & the Funky Bunch"" !!! Shouldn't expect anything more !"
1,Mindless waste,"Max Payne is a pain to watch. Other reviewers have noted how shallowand unimaginative the piece is. How much longer can intelligent viewersbe expected to accept nonstop shoot-fests with little dialog or story tohold our attention?Walhberg may have some talent, but he's not able to rescue this senselessdisplay of blasting and bashing others. My advice is don't bother."
3,Fair Overall,"Probably the biggest problem with the text is the lack of a glossary, which really makes the first few chapters far more difficult than they need be. The phylogeny chapters get weighted down by taxonomical terms that are not properly introduced."
2,Fun but not as safe as I would like.,"I got this floater recently for my 6m baby girl. I really liked that the parent would be able to closely interact with the baby while floating in the pool, you can swim around pushing comfortably and ""chatting"" with your little one.Now the parent portion has much more air in it than the infant side. When you let go the parent side goes up and the infant side looks as though it may tip backwards (flipping upwards) So there is no time that you could just let go of the floater.Also, swimming and trying to be face-to-face with your child is hard since the toy bar is right in between the two of you, and you basically have a toy bar in your face while swimming obscuring your view of your child.Over all, I wouldn't buy this toy again. I ended up getting another one just for my daughter."
1,received defective item,"I was disappointed when I realized that I received a defective float. The company responded fairly quickly when I emailed them to ask if there was anything I could do to fix it (because the problem is that it won't inflate).However, when their ""tip"" was of no help, and I asked them how to return it, they failed to respond. So all in all, poor customer service and a defective product make this a toy I would not recommend to others."
5,Great Way to Bond and get a tan!!,"My 3 1/2 mo. old daughter loves it! Supports her 13 lbs great, I hold on to her just a bit but won't have to for much longer. Highly recommend this for mom's (or dad's aunts, grandma's..) wanting to share the experience of water with their little one. Also, my daughter was barely in the water 5 minutes when she was already reaching for the colored rings, twirling them around. Stimulated her brain a bit - can't beat that. And this was our first time EVER in the water!"
3,It does hold some childrens interest,"It does hold some children's interest. It is not one long take, it is a collection of twenty segments shot and edited together to give a feeling of continuity, but the cuts from one segment to then next are obvious if you are paying attention. It is an OK ""Student film"" project.. (but considering the amateur camera work, and the nonexistent budget spent on this film it is pricey for what you get.) Fun with dry ice, baking soda vinegar, alcohol, rocket motors, tires, ramps, weights, ladders, tables, foam and sludge, water, ramps, and a camera... don't try this at home!"
3,"Interesting, but slow and rough","A comparison with the now famous Honda commcercial is inevitable. I bought this DVD after seeing the Honda commcercial, but I could not help but to think that the Honda commcercial was much better done. The pace in this film is much slower, sometimes agonisingly so. On top of that, there are a number of splices which are anything but seamless, leaving a proof that the sequence didn't really happen.Still, quite entertaining and best enjoyed late at night with blood-short eyes."
4,Utterly amazing,"first saw this on PBS, then in my art class.....an amazing video....a simple chain reaction of fire, water, bubbles, garbage bags, tires, etc....definately an obscure german film, but who cares? the film is mesmerising....shot in an old factory and set up with old, household items (as well as some non-household chemicals), this film has a very industrial feel to it (heightenend by the bad lighting in some shots).....the continuance of the chain reaction is very surreal...a must see"
5,Simply Breathtaking!,"""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."" ""Objects in motion tend to stay in motion."" If there has ever been a question as to weather or not these two sayings are true, ""The Way Things Go"" has answered it. I to stumbled upon this show late one night while sitting in my friends apartment flipping channels. I sat mesmerized with my jaw dropped as I watched. The channel was raising money and was offering the video for a $120 donation. If the video had not been offered elsewhere (like on Amazon), I would have paid it. That is how amazing this video is! I cannot wait to see the whole thing and share it with friends and family. A must see!"
4,Rube Goldberg redux,"In the last century, the cartoonist Rube Goldberg entertained and fascinated readers with his humorous cartoons of truly complicated devices or procedures that resulted in some simple task being completed. This film follows his lead and shows for some 30 minutes, using simple machines (levers, inclined planes) and fire, a series of continuous actions which accomplish nothing in particular except to entertain the viewer. No humans are shown in the film, though their work in setting up the event, apparently in a large warehouse, is evident in how smoothly, more or less, the whole crazy enterprise takes place. There is a certain underlying humor to the whole thing and also the anticipation of how the film makers will manage to keep the movement going. Bravo."
4,Wonderful for children or adults,"great for preteen boys, but needs disclaimer - don't try this at home! I have given it to friends who have children and gave to my nephew who referred to it for a science project."
5,I hate soundtracks...except this one.,"I usually hate movie soundtracks. They're usually nothing more than a way for companies to make a few extra bucks off a movie. Amelie is one of the rare exceptions. The music on this soundtrack could stand alone, without the movie. With the exception of on or two French songs, every song on this album is worth listening to. The piano music is simple, yet emotive and haunting. I used to listen to this album when I was studying in college, and it got me through just fine. I never got tired of it. It's really incredible. Definitely worth buying. By the way, the movie, Amelie, is one of the best I've ever seen. The movie, combined with the excellent music, delivers an entertainment experience that you won't forget. There are only a few movies that I feel changed the way I view all other movies, and Amelie is one of them. Trust me."
5,stupÃ©fiant... il hante mes rves,"The film was such a beauty, and the music, composed by Yann Tiersen, brought it to life with a purity and freshness unrivaled by any other film soundtrack in years. Tiersen, has modestly emerged as one of the greatest composers of the last 20 years. Perfectly French, his music is breathtaking...it haunts my dreams.The soundtrack also features two scratchy old gems: one by Frehel, a terrific French singer from the 1930s, somewhat in the vein of Piaf, Mistinguett and Josephine Baker; and one by vintage Crooner, Russ Columbo.All in all, a delightful collection."
4,Let the music take you to France,I love the original but very French sounding tracks. Yann Tiersen completely captures the fun and humor of the movie.
5,Excellent!,"This is one of my favorite movie soundtracks ever. The music is written masterfully, evoking all sorts of images. The main theme ""La Valse D'Amelie"" is such a wonderful melody and Tiersen presents it in three different ways, and each time it sounds fresh. But there's more. Tiersen actually plays many of the instruments presented on this soundtrack. So the music is played exactly the way he intended. The pieces on this soundtrack are very varied and colorful. Even if you like some tracks better than others, there is absolutely no reason you would want to skip a track on this delightful cd."
4,Great French Music,"I heard one of these songs at a children's ballet performance and fell in love with it, came straight home and googled vann tiersen. This album is delightful and fresh. There are 20 tracks on the album, many sound similar and are almost repeats of the same, but all in all I am extremely pleased with my purchase and plan to purchase more from this same artist."
5,Reminiscent of mediteranean music,"Many people are saying how French this CD sounds. However I think it sounds Greek at moments to me. Especially the sad bits.Similarities between Manos Hadjidakis(greek), Nino Rota(italian) and Nikos Mamangakis(greek). Maybe it is the common gypsy threads underneath. Nostalgia walz music is universal I think. I can think of some old B/W films of my childhood in Greece."
5,Money well spent,Otherworldly!!! This soundtrack simply transports you to another world that is so far away from home... that you don't miss home anymore.
4,"bon, meme tres bon","c tout simplement du plaisir sur disque... un peu de joie, sans etre le disque a reecouter des million de fois:)"
5,Happy Dreams,"Sometimes life get's us down, same day, they just change the letters. We like it here, but the smile's fading. And as the day's tap into years, let us hear the tapping of Yann Tiersen's feet as he play's for everybody wise enough to stop and sit down.Spread some joy, listen to this music, then go to work with a new smile, make sombody else smile. :)"
3,IMPORTANT INFO for fans of Yann Tiersen,"This is a fun film & good soundtrack. If you like this, check out the soundtrack for ""Goodbye Lenin"" also done by Tiersen. It is another great one but you won't find it listed under Yan Tiersen the way ""Amelie"" is because Amazon goofed. Just check out the sales-rank difference, all because of a database error!"
5,Uniquely captivating music,"I know I'm piling on here, but this soundtrack is a true gem--it's rocketed up to the top of my all time favorite CD's. Accordions: it sounds Paris, it sounds eastern European, it sounds ecstatic, it sounds melancoly. Don't underestimate the accordions, this album is a densely layered amazingly complex work. The sounds are totally unique yet readily accessible. It's one of those rare CD's the more you listen to it the more you like it.The album is also superbly produced, subtle and nuanced. Tiersen defies genres. It doesn't matter what kind of music you like, if you have any brain at all, you'll like this album.Besides that it ROCKS. I get so into it I almost drive my car off the road. Dangerous. Really, I can't say enough--bite the bullet, bring this CD home. Revel."
4,A Sensual Story,"Comes in Colours is a collection of the most popular songs from the Love's first three albums. The sexual revolution of the 60s accented with poetic metaphors of enlightenment provide the listener with romantic feelings of the period. Whether it's the thrill of discovery, the discovery of disappointment, the agony of abandonment, or the explosion of shared joy, each song creatively express feelings of love."
5,THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE,"I purchased this recording after reading the recommendation here and I must say that I agree whole-heartedly. The music is undoubtedly indebted to Monteverdi, especially Poppea, but still has an individual stamp. I find myself finding these early Baroque works suprisingly fresh and accessable.The singers are quite fine across the board, although Montovani's Diana could have been a little steadier. Especially good are Kennylside and Bayo. But everyone sings with style and dramatic imagination. Good balance and recording. Recommended."
3,Fake reconstruction,"La Calisto is truly a masterpiece and this is revealed in Jacobs recording, which shows very good taste and excellent singers. Nevertheless, it is not Cavalli's score. Venetian opera was normally written for voices and continuo with seldom use of violins in ritornelli and a few accompagnati arias. Jacobs, as Leppard did twenty years earlier, seems not to trust Cavalli's music because he has completely re-orchestrated the original score. The result does not sound like Venetian opera at all. It is more or less like Leppard with original instruments and cleaner voices. I think time has arrived to offer to the listener more rigorous reconstructions of early music."
3,Kind of disappointed...,"Don't get me wrong, this puzzle is great and educational but:*Is cheaply made and I expected the durable Melissa & Doug toys that I am used to getting. The letters on here are nearly paper thin.*Some of the letters are the exact same size so if you flip it upside down you can fit it in the wrong one.I wouldn't buy this puzzle again, instead I would opt for one made of better quality. I really don't see this lasting long."
3,Just okay,"Itâs just okay. We have a ton of Melissa and Doug toys and this one was, unfortunately, not our favorite. Itâs not a terrible puzzle, but there are some little things that bothered me. For example, the lowercase d and p are the same color and virtually identical (each fits in the otherâs spot). Given we bought this puzzle specifically to help with identifying lowercase letters, itâs a bit disappointing. Overall, itâs not terrible, but itâs not greatâ¦just okay."
2,Fake Melissa & Doug puzzle,"I don't think this is a real Melissa & Doug product. We have a lot of their puzzles and toys and this is just not up to the standard of the other items we have. It looks really cheap and the pieces are poorly cut out and flimsy. I bought this for my little one to learn his lower case letters but I do not recommend it, especially if you have a baby or toddler that likes to put things in their mouth, the paint looks like it would come right off!"
3,Lower case letters too short,"The product quality is so-so. The lowercase letters are not the correct height. For example, the lower case 'b' is almost as tall as the uppercase 'B', but the lowercase 'd' is MUCH smaller than the 'D'. And, the letters not cut out well, they are like clouds for the lack of a better word, not much definition or true to the actual shape of the real letters. The 'N' and 'P' are my least favorite, they look like clouds or are not proportionally correct. Hard to explain, I may add a photo later. I understand the 'j' and 'i' having to be one piece, but poor choice in font overall. Would not buy again."
4,Great learning tool!,"I saw this when I went by a friend and we immediately came home and ordered it for our 2 year old son. It is designed for 3 years and older so we had to watch him in the beginning because he wanted to put certain letters in his mouth such as the ""C"" like Cookie Monster on Sesame Street. Otherwise, great learning tool for him as he is forming words and sounding out letters. He hasn't even engaged with the pictures behind the letters yet."
2,good yet disappointing,"I am a very big fan of Melissa and Doug puzzles and my daughter has about 8 of their puzzles. I bought this one for my almost 2 year old so she could learn her lowercase letters in addition to the uppercase. She quickly did that, and she enjoys the puzzle. This puzzle seems doesn't seem to be made with the same quality materials as the others. All of the wood is very thin, feels like plywood. Some of the letters don't fit very well or are so similar it's hard to tell what's what, like the d, b, p, and q. None of these 4 fit perfectly and we go off color to figure out which is which."
3,"Not as sturdy as I had hoped, but okay","These are okay, but my kid is extremely hard on his toys, and I'm not sure they will hold up. The wood is rather thin. I thought they were going to be more blocky. It's still a nice product, though."
4,We are learning letters,This is a great puzzle for learning the letters. I have three preschool age kids that all enjoy lifting the letters to look at the picture or my oldest can now place them in the correct spot. I purchased this one over some of the cheaper ones because these puzzle pieces are in the actual shape of the letter- something I think is important while learning the letters. Some of the others have the same whitespace shape all around. Also I like that both upper and lower case letters are next to each other to help with recognition... just somethings to keep in mind while your looking for alphabet puzzles.
