2,we need a preview,"I teach Bless Me, Ultima in a 10th grade English Class. I thought that this might be a valuable educational aide. There is some useful information in here, but much of it is not what I expected. Such a product needs to be previewable to the customer. I took a chance and while i don't regret the purchase, I won't be buying any other ""Novels for students"" publications."
5,Fabulous Traveling Friend,"My daugher received this apple when she was about a week old. For a newborn it makes a nice visual stimuli with the various colors and patterns. As she got older she began to touch it and explore. Now that she is a year old Andy (or Allie as we call her) rides in the car everywhere we go. She loves shaking her to make noises or pulling the worm inside that vibrates as it is drawn back in. I've never tried to hang it on a car seat, but we've used the ""link"" on it to attach it to the side of our stroller so she didn't get launched and that worked well. Busy hands = happy car ride!"
3,It hits my baby in the face.,"I bought this for my 3 month old to hang on his car seat. It is too big and hits him in the face. Also, he cannot open the apple or pull the arms and legs yet. I think three months is a little young for this toy. This would be better for an older baby-around 5 or 6 months at the earliest."
2,Velcro is sharp,My daughter loved Anna Banana right from the start. She played with it immediately....however by the time we got to the register she had managed to scratch up her face pretty badly from the velcro that holds the banana peels up. I did complain to the company.....I hope this problem has been resolved. I just removed the velcro.
5,Best car toy,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 1 month old. He is 6 month now and has never lost interest in playing with the toy. He loves the rattle noise when banana shakes from side to side and enjoys sucking on hands/feet. This is the only toy that occupies him during the car ride. Out of countless toys I bought for him, this is one of the top ten best buy."
3,Nice toys,These toys are great for baby exploration and the like but they have a big flaw(in my opinion):they all pick a LOT of lint and I have to continuously get it off of the toys. I do not like that but my son seems not to care about it.
5,Fruity Pals,This was a gift for my grandson. Not sure about the grandson but I am told his Dad loves it :)
3,Just OK,"cute costume, quality ok, shirt & pants fit like they should, hat really needs a chin strap and shoe covers do not fit over shoes."
4,Pretty good costume,"This costume ran true to size and my son did look a lot like Peter Pan. I thought the quality was a bit poor for the price, however. Unfortunately, there just isn't a lot out there in 12 month old size."
3,Cute,It is a very nice little costume. Good craftsmanship and comfortable for the baby. We had a little trouble keeping the booties on him so we just did without those.
5,Great textbook.,"As a teacher of drawing, I have read many books on the subject. This book is the only one I would use as a textbook. I would agree with all the previous reviews but would only comment on the one review from the budding artist who felt the book is confusing and has too much art history for someone who only wants to learn to draw. I come to this book with over two decades of art experience so maybe that is why I find it so interesting, but even if the history is skipped and you read only the practical explanations and do the lessons in the back of the book, you will learn to draw from observation, as this book promises. The book is not meant to be read in two weeks. Learning to draw takes hard work and invested time."
2,Difficult writing?,"I regrettably found this book to be disappointing in that the writing is most difficult to interpret. I realize that the author is attempting to represent the manner in which each of the characters might communicate but, forgive my lack of understanding, I was expecting a novel approach to the exploits of the ""Corps of Discovery,"" not an exercise in translation. It was hard going and that's not what I expect in a historical novel."
2,Disjointed and boring,"I read this book on a recent cruise, a time when I was very relaxed and had plenty of time to concentrate on a good read. I found the concept intriguing--the story told from several different points of view--but the author, I think, is self-indulgent and makes too many demands on the readers with the rapid shifts in tone and its dense and muddled tone. And I did not come away from the book with a very good idea of any of the characters. I hardly ever do this, but I gave up on the book about three-quarters of the way through. I'm sure there must be much better books out there on this subject. I was very disappointed..."
1,An Adventure Spoiled,"I found the book an extremely difficult read. The writting style varies throughtout while the story line chronologically jumps back and forth. There are also times where scenes are depicted with unnecessarily crudity. As someone who throughly enjoyed ""From Sea to Shinning Sea"" and ""Undaunted Courage"", and who was ready for another pleasurable dose of Lewis and Clark, the book left me bitterly disappointed."
1,Love it or hate it!,"The average rating of 3-stars on the Amazon display is misleading. Start to scroll through the readers' reviews and you quickly see that each reader either loved it or hated it. My suggestion is borrow a copy or check it out from your local library and read the first four chapters. It should be apparent to you by then as to which camp you will belong.The author states that his purpose with this historical fiction was to fill in the gaps about the L&C; expedition and people involved; at this there is mostly failure. He succeeds in breathing some life into the characters, if previously they were two-dimensional history book names to you. But the more you know about these men and the expedition, the more you can make sense of the book; the reverse is not true.I read the book as quickly as I could just to finish it and get on with more enjoyable, worthwhile reading. As is said about so many products and services, there is always a group to swear by it and to swear at it!"
1,It had potential.,"Amazon should be ashamed to have this book on the same page as Undaunted Courage. While this book is somewhat true to the history of Lewis and Clark, The author (He who shall not be named) has created a filthy distusting bunch of words that make very little sense. My stomach was turned by this book on more than one occasion. The graphic detail was not needed in context.If you must read this book, wait to find it in my recycle bin."
1,Huge Disappointment,"Several choice words come to mind with respect to this book--contrived, banal, two-dimensional are just a few. Such a wonderful premise--filling in the blanks of history with fictional, hopefully plausible, details. But to reduce Charbonneau to essentially nothing more than a sex-crazed, blathering idiot, Sacajawea to a mute, ineffectual slave and Lewis to a bipolar, social misfit narrows the scope of possibilities rather than increases them.Add that to a nearly impossible-to-read narrative with hackneyed writing, very little action with regard to the actual exploration, and voila! One of the worst reads of the year. Were no editors involved in the making of this book?"
1,Save Your Money,"Mr. Hall failed in his attempt to give the reader insight into the personalities and experiences of the Lewis & Clark team.The text jumped from one scene to another without any transition, it was difficult to follow when he changed subjects.When he was attempting to present the perspective of the American Indians he did not capitalize names and used minimal punctuation. This was confusing at best and often left me with no idea who or what he was talking about and how it all tied into the expedition. He may be an expert on all the various names which applied to each tribe. But most readers are not. It would have been helpful if he had used the commonly known tribal and individual names.In addition his use of profanity was unnecessary and got in the way of the story he was trying to tell.There are several really good books out there on the history and persons who made this journey. This one isn't one of them."
2,Vapid commentary on the relationship between Lewis and Clark,"Hall had the opportunity to create a major work of the relationship between Lewis and Clark, had it not been for his over-use of 4-letter 20th-century vulgarities that had no bearing on the era. Because of his self-indulgence in ""potty-talk"", his novel can only be taken as an interesting read, but totally lacking in historical accuracy.Readers might enjoy ""Dear Brother"", by James Holmberg, recommended by the Lewis and Clark Heritage Foundation"
3,More Poetry than History,"If you are looking for ""stream of consciousness"" writing and some very poetic passages, this book could be five stars. I was looking for adventure and found this book to be outside this domain, hence, the three stars. As a Native American, I did appreciate the chapters on Sacajawea. This has to be one of the best attempts I have ever encountered to capture the differences in culture between the Europeans and Native Americans. It adds a dimension to this account that makes it decidedly different from the usual L&C fare. It still amazes me how little we know about any of the people who were a part of this expedition that took place just a couple of hundred years ago. What is known with certainty about Sacajawea and Drouilliard, for instance, could probably be written on the back of an envelope. This novel is so rich in characterization that it stands in sharp contrast to what we really know. With a few exceptions, we are basically an ahistorical society."
1,awful,"I bought this violin about 6 months ago from internet vendor. This is the worst violin I have ever tried. Nothing is true about this violin's description. First, wood smelled like they were just cut fresh, not aged at all. Varnish on wood is terrible for any stringed instrument. It has the worst furniture varnish consist of thick uneven coat of poorly applied polyurethane. Finger board is painted black and it is not even straight. Chin rest and peg are made out of plastic, not ebony. There were no ebony parts. They are either painted black or plastic. The bridge is not even maple. It is cut poorly and won't fit correctly. Pegs will slip and snap. Fine tuners will wobble too much. Then strings will break. If you want cheap violin, buy Suzuki or Klaus Mueller. At least they work like violin and sound like violin"
2,"Lots of features, but the sound is sub par","Description sounded very nice, and included bows, nice case and extra strings (not very good) and rosin. It looks ok but it needed lot of adjustments. Bridge was not set at right height, and had to adjust it. No matter what I did, it was difficult to get good sound out of it. I guess I got what I paid for. My daughter did not like the sound and went back to old Suzuki violin until we bought a decent Eastman violin. Paid lot more, but sounds lot better too. Difficulty in buying violin over the internet is that you do not get to try it out. Since these are factory made from China, you will get lucky once in a while. My son also plays and he got lucky with CVN-400 3/4 size, which sounded wonderful. So, you might get lucky, but if you pay just a bit more, you can get a violin that will sound better. Good luck and let me know if you want to buy a used CVN-600 violin, ..."
1,god-awful,"1) The bridge is not high enough to support the 1st and 2nd strings. They just lay down on fingerboard directly although it offers two bridges.This violin is useless to anyone because you need to resolve the above problem firstly. To have a new hand made bridge costs USD 120 here. Besides, I have no evidence but it very likely this violin was made in China. By the same price, I will suggest Romania's."
4,Excellent product,"I was skeptical upon first buying this product, but it works great! At one point I actually crapped myself and my girlfriend at the other end of the couch had no idea. I don't even think the dog knew I did it! Without this product I would have been terribly embarassed and my girlfriend may have left me."
2,Disappointing Indeed,"I bought this cushion after moving into a new office and, as Murphy's Law would have it, always having someone walk in right after I ripped something good. I saw the glowing reviews and figured this might be my way of getting the problem under control. Well, I just received the product this morning, put it on my chair, let it rip, and low and behold, still odors. The product is just a regular cushion with a piece of carbon filter in it (which you can get at a pet store or hardware store for a price significantly cheaper than offered on the GasBGone site). While I appreciate the humor value in this product, I'm sorely disappointed with the quality and effectiveness. If you're buying this for serious reasons look elsewhere or make your own."
1,BS,"Coming from someone with a terrible case of IBS who takes this seriously unlike the jokers reviewing this product, this doesn't work at all, not even a little."
1,Farting is not funny,"Flatulence is a disease affecting at least one out of every five Americans. We need to respond to this epidemic with compassion and ingenuity, not bathroom humor and fart jokes. Just imagine the message that this product sends to our children, how even now little Johnny is lying in bed fearing that something is ""wrong"" with him.Well I am not laughing. The real solution is to stop farts before they escape, not merely treat the symptoms of this dire condition.Instead of spending you hard earned cash filling the coffers of the Fart Shame Industry, strike a blow against body shame by boycotting this product and using a time honored holistic remedy that treats the REAL problem.Yes, I am talking about the cork. There's probably one sitting in your recycling bin right now. Do it for the children."
4,good product if thats your thing,"NOTE: this is an edited review, apparently the sissy types that read my original cant handle the truth, its NOT my fault this is a fart filter which i need and like, after all IT IS PATENTED!"
2,The instructions were lacking....returned for credit,"I was actually refered to the GasBGon by my wife after years of ""gas"" arguments in the evening. I found that it did eliminate the odor of flatulance shot directly into the pillow and also helped muffle the noise. My suggestion to the manufacturer and reason for the low rating is that the fabric absorbs stains to easily and is not water proof. I found my pillow to have ""skids"" after only one week of use and returned it after the stains wouldn't come out."
1,Misled,"At first, this item was advertised as the complete book and MUSIC of Hairspray, but I should have known that would not be available for purchase. I expected at least a couple songs of the music, not just the lyrics, because of the advertisement. Really pay attention to every specific word before you order anything."
4,What is disease? LOOK HERE!!,"""Toxemia: The Basic Cause of the Disease"" opened my eyes to my true health picture and what I was doing wrong. According to Dr. Tilden, chronic degenerative diseases are merely symptoms of toxic waste products, retained in the blood, causing a crisis (disease). Dr. Tilden also mentions the astonishing effects that stress can have on our health. Stress simply multiplies the effects of toxemia. John H. Tilden was a man ahead of his time.This book has been a great help to me with my fibromyalgia condition. I want to regain and maintain my health without the use of medication. This book points the way!!"
5,Great Knife,"I did not buy this knife on line. In fact, when I bought this knife ""on line"" didn't exist. My knife is about 35 years old and is a great tool. The blades hold their edge and the craftsmanship is superb. I would recommend this knife to anyone. However, don't expect to put it in your pocket. I wear mine in a sheath on my belt."
5,Buck 301 Stockman knife.,"The Buck 301 Stockman knife replaces an Old Timer of the same size that I have had for 50 years, and wish to retire.So far the Buck 301 Stockman made in the USA has done a great job. Only time and use will tell if it is as good asthe Made in the USA Old Timer. Made in China knives are useless, won't hold an edge."
3,"Bought it for the B-Sides, I was good, One wasn't","This was the first ever single I bought. So I'll tell you my opinion of it. I think Trouble which you all heard is a good rock song. Delerium is a song about a girl with problems. I like the message of the song, well i can't stand the chorus. Free is a bluesy rock song which should've been used on the album. I recommend this single to any Pink fan."
5,SAINTS ALIVE!,"I am a convert to Catholicism and therefore I did not grow up knowing about many of the saints of the Church. This book is helping to acquaint myself to the richness and wisdom of these holy men and women of God in a way that is refreshing and easy to understand.Bert's style of mixing various quotes from the saints' writings with a short story of their situation is especially inspiring and leads to quality time of reflection. In addition, I enjoy the various ""road maps"" within the book allowing me several options for reading.Great job, Mr. Ghezzi! When's the sequel coming out?"
4,See the most popular recording of Rampal!,"The Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano made 530 weeks in the charts! That's no typo--more than ten years! The backdrop of this recording are various places in the Versaille Palace in France. The only thing that may disappoint fans is that this video uses the exact same track as the CD and the players are simply ""lip syncing"" or playing along with the original recording. There are however some few minutes of actual playing by the group but only to simulate a practice session.However, those who enjoyed the original CD version will enjoy this visual treat."
3,A Book of Another Name,"This is the British version of B.F.'s Daughter. I should know, I have both and found myself recalling the story when I got to this one. B.F.'s Daughter was the first Marquand I read a number of years ago. A couple of his Mr. Moto books also have multiple titles. If you want to read a review, you should look up the B.F.'s Daughter title."
4,Exactly What I Needed,"I bought this as a present for someone else, so I was looking for a very specific edition and this was perfect! It came a little later than I was expecting, but it was worth the wait to find it for cheap!"
4,Nice jeans,"These jeans fit well. I have a curvy shape so 'slim' jeans just won't do. These feel true to size, though plenty roomy; really couldn't go down a full size. The no-gap waistband is the best feature as the jeans lay flat below the waist. The overdyed black looks nice, too - a bit dressier than any other black jeans I have owned. They are also much lighter weight than anticipated. I bought these for horseback riding, but really need to order a heavier-duty jean for that as I don't think these will hold up. There is a bit of give in the material, so the jeans fit well and are comfortable when astride. Overall, I am satisfied."
3,Good Jeans -but must order one size smaller,"I like the product but they run bigger than normal. You must order one size smaller than normal when ordering. Am size Medium or 10, so if i order again, i must be small or 8."
2,These are Misses Cut -- Not Women's,"Note that these are Misses sizes, not ""Women's"" as stated in the description and size chart. I'm a size 16 and since I'm thick in the hip and thigh area I wear women's cut jeans (usually Bill Blass (size 16W) or JNY (size 18W)). Since all of the reviews said these ran a little big I decided to try them and ordered both a 16W and 18W. However, what I received was a 16R and 18R. I tried the 18's and they do run a little big in the hip area but were still too tight on the thigh. A 16W would probably have been perfect!"
3,airplane,Very good service but the product even though it was new didn't work properly because it was so old.
2,...and I'm being generous to give it two stars,"This is the weakest Brothers Four collection I have and the two weakest albums I've heard from them.Regarding ""Sing of Our Times"" -- there's nothing better than mediocre in the whole set and ""Beans Taste Fine"" is ridiculously bad. I can't recommend this album at all.Regarding ""The Honey Wind Blows"" -- a mixed bag. This album marks an early move by the Brothers Four from folk music into ""easy listening"" with their covers of ""Somewhere"" and ""Feed the Birds"" -- the performances are nice but they don't have anything to do with folk music. ""Cleano"" is also ridiculously bad. On the other hand, ""Turn Around,"" ""The Waves Roll Out,"" and ""Little Play Soldiers"" are as good as anything the Brothers Four ever did. By itself, I could recommend this album.Together the two albums make a weak collection. I can only recommend the CD for die-hard Brothers Four fans to fill-out their collections."
1,A very poor book,"Please do not torture yourself by buying this book. The title of Visual Basic.Net for Dummies would indicate that this book is appropriate for somebody who wishes to learn this computer language. It is a horrible learning tool.Twenty-five years after engineering school, I wanted to refresh my computer programming skills which were very good. However much has changed and I needed a guide. The frustration that I encounter with this book is greater than I ever experienced in Engineering school. Remember, engineering school is designed to be very challenging. I told my wife that I thought that I was smart, but my brain must have degenerated since my high honor college days.Then, I read Murach's Beginning Visual Basic.Net. What was difficult was now clear. Buy Murach's book if you want to learn this subject. Thank goodness for Murach. He showed me that I still had a functioning brain. I was not stupid. Visual Basic.Net for Dummies is very stupid."
3,MEL BLANC MUSIC,"If you really enjoy loony toons cartoons with Mel Blanc voices, you may enjoy this cd very much. We were actually only looking for the one song...The Hat I Got For Christmas Is Too Big...but after listening to the whole album we enjoyed it very much."
4,Come on up in the tree and sing some harmony!,"Mel Blanc was best known for doing the voices of literally hundreds of cartoon characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Woody Woodpecker, Yosemite Sam, Barney Rubble and many more. But he also made dozens of novelty records. He actually had hits with ""Woody Woodpecker"", ""Toot, Toot, Toosie"" and ""I Taut I Taw a Puddy Tat"". This CD features 25 of his novelty records. Most of the songs here are good, but some of my favorites are missing. I really wish this CD included ""Big Bear Lake"", ""K-K-K-Katy"", ""Ten Little Bottles"" and ""Daffy Duck's Rhapsody"". There would have been room for them if they hadn't included so many Christmas songs. Four Christmas songs is a bit too many for a non-Christmas CD, one would have been plenty."
4,What do you think his name is? Melvin!,"Mel Blanc was best known for doing the voices of literally hundreds of cartoon characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Woody Woodpecker, Yosemite Sam, Barney Rubble and many more. But he also made dozens of novelty records. He actually had hits with ""Woody Woodpecker"", ""Toot, Toot, Toosie"" and ""I Taut I Taw a Puddy Tat"". This CD features 25 of his novelty records. Most of the songs here are good, but some of my favorites are missing. I really wish this CD included ""Big Bear Lake"", ""K-K-K-Katy"", ""Ten Little Bottles"" and ""Daffy Duck's Rhapsody"". There would have been room for them if they hadn't included so many Christmas songs. Four Christmas songs is a bit too many for a non-Christmas CD, one would have been plenty."
4,Great Outline Book,"I found this book awesome for quick review. If you want detailed explanations, use Harrison's! I would recommend this book highly, especially to those who paid attention in class and only need a quick review. This book gives you what you need to know for USMLE step 2."
1,Appleton & Lange's Outline Review for the USMLE Step 2,"I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I FIRST READ THE BOOK,IT WAS WASTAGE OF TIME&MONEY, EVEN NOT GOOD FOR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT OR NURSE PRACTITIONER."
4,Not what I was expecting,"This movie has been on my must see list for some time. Have been a fan of Sergio Leone for some time. I enjoyed the movie, with its twisted unpredictable plot, quirky characters, and great imagery. And of course the music. Just a great western. Recommended."
5,A Must-See Movie,"An early Clint Eastwood that is clever, entertaining, funny, at times violent and also dreary, as the Civil War is going on. What more could you want in a movie? If you are a Clint Eastwood fan this is a must-see movie. Lee Van Cleef (sp?) has the best eyes for a bad guy. He is gripping. The movie is worth watching just for his performance. And the ugly little guy is just hopeless. Guess who the good guy is? If you have to see one Western, this might be it...although ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" runs close."
5,stay with the older dvd,"The extra 15 minutes is highly distracting. Eli Wallach's voice has changed considerably over the decades, and it is very annoying. Those extra minutes do explain some of the plot holes throughout the movie, but does very little else. If you can find the original release, which I just found on Amazon, minus the extra footage, then go for that DVD and save yourself some money. I love the movie, but those extra minutes don't explain Eli's voice sounding oneway one minute and something totally different the next."
5,ONE OF THE TWO BEST WESTERNS OF ALL TIME.,"The other one is ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", also directed by Sergio Leone. As in some of the best Spaghetti Western movies, in ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" there are no heroes, only antiheroes at best, all the characters are capable of anything in order to remain alive.Ennio Morricone's score is another character in this epic set in a Western, the main theme is one of the most well-known songs in the world of the music from the movies. The photography is flawless, as well as Sergio Leone's direction. The characters are so fascinating that the audiences are interested in them from beginning to end.""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" is one of the two best westerns, both this movie and ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" are essential videos, both films made by Sergio Leone."
3,Extra 13 mins - An editor's got to know his limitations,The extended version boasts an extra 13 minutes of movie. After watching the extended version it is clear why the 13 minutes were left out. In the video extras the editor sheepishly trys to explain his obvious mistake by using Sergio Leone as a scapegoat. Skip this version and rent the orginal American version instead.
2,Mediocre.,"If you're a ""Spaghetti"" buff, it's worth it for the 2nd disc interviews. But I didn't like the extended version. It has always been my opinion that movies at the time they were made, are edited for a reason. I don't see the story value in the added cuts, +, the voices are dubbed by an older Eastwood and Wallach, and it shows. The final blow is the terrible and uninteresting commentary by Richard Schickel. Why they didn't use Christopher Frayling for the third triology film, I don't know. So, I bought the 3 disc trilogy, and that suits me fine."
5,"Good, badk and ugly blu-ray review",Truly a classic movie. All the better in Blu-ray and the director's comments and extra minutes make it all the more enjoyable.
5,My favorite western,"I'm not a ""western"" type of guy, but Sergio Leone's Man with no Name trilogy reeled me in to three of the greatest westerns ever made, starring none other than Clint himself.Nothing compares to this movie in terms of style. Every character has its own charm-be it Clint's reluctant style, or ugly's cunning nature and the cruel ""bad"" guy (determine for yourself who is good, bad or ugly). The music has become kind of an anthem for the ""wild wild west"" movies and has been copied the world over. I have seen the movie half a dozen times, still I cannot resist playing the DVD whenever I get time. Would highly recommend it to everyone."
3,Wish the original US release edit was in the box too.,I love The Good the Bad & the Ugly (along with all Leone's Westerns) but the 2-disc Collector's edition disappointed me. I was excited to see the extra footage that was in the original Italian version but after seeing it I quickly ran out and bought the older (original US version) DVD because the dubbing of Older Clint & Eli on the new scenes took me completely out of the movie (although I commend their efforts). To me it stands out like a sore thumb when you suddenly hear old mens voices coming from the young faces & I truly wonder if Leone would have wanted it released like this knowing it would sound like this. I wish they would have simply included the previous 'Original US release' cut without all the extra footage but with all the great color correction & sound mix. Hopefully in the future & on the Blu-Ray.5 stars for the movie - 1 star for the actors voice dubbing in the new scenes.
5,Clint Eastwood Classic,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly DVDThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the finale of Sergio Leone's trilogy about the ""Man with No Name"", Clint Eastwood's most famous role outside of Dirty Harry. This movie makes a strong case for being a Western Classic.Highly recommended for Eastwood fans and fans of the spaghetti western.Gunner December, 2007"
5,My Favorite ;),"I love This Extended Version Collector's Set Thats why I bought 2 Copies heh,yeah You Should get it too,'tis a MASTERPIECE :)"
5,Clint Eastwood's best,"First, this is my second favorite film of all time! Second, it has the best soundtrack ever. Third, it's non-stop entertainment. It is VERY well directed, and Sergio Leone comes very close to Akira Kurosawa at directing. Clint Eastwood is spectacular, and so is Eli Wallach. The plot unfolds itself wonderfully, and introduces the characters. It even has a civil war mood to the story! This is the greatest Western of all time, just remember that."
3,Great movie - terrible Blu-ray,"For the past year I've been Netflixing and purchasing Blu-rays nonstop and I've seen atleast a hundred discs so far. Generally I've always been able to tell people that most Blu-rays look great, at the worst still better than the DVD release - that I've yet to see a truely bad release. This is all largely assisted by high bitrates. However, for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly the mastering studio really dropped the ball.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of the few releases (other than some asian Kung Fu releases I've seen) that I'd say the video quality is so bad that you may as well not waste the money upgrading your DVD. They DNRed the film so much that it sort of looks like an oil painting.It's a shame because the movie is so great, and definitely a classic. :/ So much detail lost."
4,Terrific all time classic Western,"Well the only thing that prevented me from giving this 5 stars is the sound tracking....that the actors and some of the voices are so out of sync its horrendous. They could have done better....it was 1967 and they could have at least overlayed the sound properly.That gripe aside, this is one of the all time great classic Westerns. They really put in the time and Hollywood cashola on this one because the storyline, backdrops, cinematography, and music are all tremendous. The music I think deserves special mention....it is one of the most breathtaking scores I have ever heard and Im sure that the folks who worked on the Star Wars movies took a few cues from this score. Its awesome.So if youre a fan of westerns and/or great movies, go pick this up right away because its terrific!!!"
5,!!,Excellent restoration... it has the extended version with all the parts edited out when brought to America. Any western fan should have this in BR (it endures scratches and so better)
3,Blu-ray Review,Extended cut but not as good a restoration as The Searchers or the James Bond movies.
5,This film finally gets the red carpet treatment from MGM!!!,"Finally ""The Good,The Bad and The Ugly"" finally gets the red carpet treatment it deserves from the guys at MGM Home Entertainment!!! This superlative 2-DVD set includes the extended version of the film in both English and Italian!!! Wow!!! It sports BOTH great picture and sound!!! It also contains a wealth of extras to enjoy!!! This great DVD set will keep you amuzed for hours!!! And to cap it off,it comes in a nice collector's case!!! A very well rounded package of a very superior western starring Clint Eastwood,Lee Van Cleef,and Eli Wallach!!! Sure, it costs ""a few dollars more"" than the standard single disc version but it's well worth the money!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
5,The best Film of all time,"The Good the Bad and the Ugly can easily be called one of the greatest films of all time. From Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach's superb acting to the brilliant directing of Sergio Leone, the film is a masterpiece. The dvd allows the viewer to watch in awe of the amazing work done on this film. The composition of every shot is breathtaking and the plot is gripping. Plus, Clint Eastwood is the man!"
2,3 Words: Digital Noise Reduction,"Let me get this out of the way first, the movie is a 5 star film.Now that thats out of the way, let me continue on to this Bluray.For some reason, the studio has found it necessary to infuse this film with DNR. In fact after reading several reviews of the U.S. release, and seeing several screenshots of the U.S. release, I was floored by how awful this Bluray looks.The faces look as smoothed over as a wax figurine in many many scenes. In fact, if you've ever seen the Patton Bluray, this pretty much mimics it completely.If you have the 2 Disc Special Edition DVD, just pull it off the shelf and watch it again, but don't support the studio on this awful cartoonish release of such a great film."
5,"Great movie, 5 stars",I absolutely love this movie. It shows in full HD 1080P and the movie is stunning.
4,"A Little Overrated, But Still A Great Western","I find ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" and ""For A Few Dollars More"" better, but this one is still good.Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef do an amazing job playing these characters."
5,A TURE CLINT EASTWOOD GEM OF A MOVIE,"I THINK THAT THIS MOVIE IS A TRUE ART FORM AND DEFINITELY ONE OF CLINT EASTWWOOD'S BEST OF ALL TIME. ALSO THE PARTS OF ELI WALLACH AND LEE VAN CLEEF SHOULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED, THE BOTH WERE SUPERB! THE WHOLE PRODUCTION KEEPS YOUR UNDEVIDED ATTENTION AND LEAVES YOU WITH THE FEELING OF JUST VIEWING A ""TRUE CLASSIC!!"" I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE WITHOUT HESITATION!! THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY IS A GREAT BUY!!"
2,Picture Quality lacking due to Techniscope!!,"Well, The poor picture quality of this release can be that it was shot in Techniscope, which is a early version of Super-35 that uses a smaller amount of the full 35mm aperture for economy during shooting. You will notice that the first three of Leone's films will always be of slightly lower picture quality due to the fact they were all Techniscope releases. Now, Once a Upon A Time was shot in Panavision which is full 35 mm scope quality. It should look great on BLU-RAY. Don't always blame the studio, It can only look as good as the original negitive. Peckinpah."
2,Beware What is Missing!,"I was pretty surprised to find out there is no option to watch the original theatrical release! Shocking actually. To each his own and if you like the new scenes you will like this version but the added scenes do nothing for me and the voices are not the same (Lee Van Cleef's part is dubbed by somebody else). I would like to continue to watch the original. Also, the new soundtrack is noticeably different having been modified with new special effects to create the 5.1 Dolby. Again there is no option to play the original soundtrack! Just plain STUPID! I'll go back to watching my DVD! I consider this a waste of money."
5,Still a classic,"If you've seen the movie, then you know what you get. The picture is greatly restored. I haven't made it through all of the bonus features yet, but the few I have were interesting (including the brief look at the process of restoration and the extended Tuco torture scene and information about a deleted Tuco scene). This 3-hour movie is as good now as when I first saw it. Buy this and you won't be disappointed."
4,Great film and nice package but flawed by anti-theft tag!,"This has to be one of the classic ""Spaghetti Westerns"" and I chuckled to see that it's supposedly Quentin Tarantino's favorite film.It's really too bad, though, that M-G-M felt compelled to ruin an otherwise really nice package by placing one of those cursed anti-theft devices under the transparent disc tray, where it wrecks the cosmetics of the box and cannot be removed. One star off for that insult to us collectors."
5,the man with no name trilogy goes out with a bang,the absolute greatest western ever made. clint eastwood proves that john wayne has nothing on him. lee van cleef is the greatest bad guy ever. and ellie wallach gives an oscar winning performance as tuco. if you havent seen this movie see it. if you have seen this movie see it again. it never gets old.
2,The appeal of this film is lost on me,Especially in lieu of the many other Clint Eastwood/Sergio Leonne collaborations that far outdistance this predictable and utterly ridiculous story.Clint as always is great. Wallach is such a goof it's totally implausible that he would have made it to the end of the film without getting killed.I'll take For a Few Dollars More any day over this.
2,Not the best one...,"Just got e-mail reply from Fox distrubutor here in Finland, that the U.S release will have the same video/audio stream that the finnish release. Now, if that is true, it is a bad, bad, release. The picture quality is not BD quality, much like SE dvd-release(Ps. I you have one, stick with it). The 2-disc Special Edition dvd release has better audio and the same picture quality, than the BD-release. Well, as soon as I get my U.S release, and compare them, I'll info more."
1,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",Terrible. Director Leone amuses himself while showing the audience a self indulgent unbelieveable mess albiet beautifully photographed.
1,What Good?,"Sergio Leone plumbed his greatest depths of nitwittedness when he essayed the script for this travesty. Still, people are watching it 35 years later, so his financiers got something out of it. It would take the film's full running time to detail how bad it is but one scene captures some of the flavor. Prisoner Eli Wallach the Ugly is being transported to the gallows by Union troop train when he throws himself and his guard out the door of a crowded boxcar. Nobody says hey, train never stops, and neither does another express coming the other way when Wallach uses it to cut the cuffs between him and his dead captor, despite the fact that the deceased is laying in the middle of the tracks. Leone knew exactly nothing about the American West and neither do the people who enjoy his ludicrously mismanaged fantasies about the time and place."
2,"Best western, worse blu-ray.","Unfortunately the best western ever is not the best blu-ray ever. The blu-ray version is the extended cut which is a huge downgrade from the original theatrical cut. The 17 or so minutes that are added to the 161 minute theatrical cut really ruin the pacing of the film. There is a reason they didn't make the theatrical cut. The blu-ray ONLY CONTAINS THE EXTENDED CUT while the dvd that comes with it has the theatrical cut. Why they couldn't have both on the blu-ray I don't understand but it is really to bad.I give the Theatrical cut 5 stars, the extended 4 stars, and the blu-ray 2 for being so stupid and not including both."
5,The Good Bad & Ugly DVD,Completely satisified with the product. Has extra scenes not in the version from years ago. Enjoyed the movie very much!!!
5,Old time movies,I fell in love with the classic hero western movies when I was a child. Thankfully they are still available to enjoy today. Thanks Amazon
5,$200! It's all I've got!,"Buy this on blu-ray by all means, but don't let the extra footage be the selling point. It looks and sounds fantastic. That's why you should buy this disc. It's one of my favorite films, and this is the best way to see it for now.The extra footage is fine.. I'd even say that it's a nice addition to an already great film, but you should buy this anyway."
3,Migrant Threat Comedy,"A next movie of Indian migrants to the UK of the seventies, where a hard working teen newcomer outwits a native cute girl by preferring studying to a sex-enjoyment and manual jobs.Moral: better watch ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" , where people work together."
1,Historical inaccuracies and typos equal a grand flop,"This effort is one of the most disappointment among the 100 or so baseball history titles that I have read in the past half-dozen years. The book is poorly edited and filled with literally hundreds of typographical errors. (Also the footnotes section at the end of the hardcover edition is simply eliminated from the end of the paperback, without corresponding adjustments in the text!) This factor is especially disappointing when it comes to the butchered names of dozens of Latin ballplayers. There are also numerous historical inaccuracies here. Hispaniola is not an island to the west of Cuba. Jackie Robinson was not called up to the Brooklyn Dodgers ""not long after the 1947 began."" Aluminum bats are not made in Cuba by the Batos company. And such errors go on and on. This book is a major disappointment when it comes to historical historical research."
2,fell apart,I was not happy when my son gave this as a gift to a boy at a party. It broke the first use. I also bought one for my husband. It lasted a little longer then broke after about a week or two. Not satisfied.
3,"Fun, yet not very practical.","It was fun to play with for a little while, but I grew bored with it pretty quickly, it definitly didn't fly as far as I thought it would."
1,Never even received the toy!,"My item was supposedly shipped on Dec. 5th with a delivery estimate of Dec. 10 to Dec. 15. When it didn't arrive I emailed the seller and have never received a reply. Today is December 20th!! I would never order from them again. I think I will never see the item or my money. I ordered this company's item through Amazon because I thought it would be safe and fast. Not so much!"""
1,watch out for shipping costs,"Note that the prices for all of these ""slingshot toys"" are low, but the shipping and handling COST MORE THAN THE ACTUAL TOY. I didn't realize this until it was too late. Rest assured that I would not have paid [...] for a flying frog had I been thinking; I thought everything I was buying was coming from Amazon and I'd have a single shipping charge. It was a cute little inexpensive stocking stuffer at [...], but positively not worth more than that. My fault for not being careful, but CAVEAT EMPTOR."
1,Not cool.,"This is a great buy for those who like to waste their money on junk from communist China. I wouldn't even let my dog play with it. The thing sheds all over the place. The frog, not the dog, sheds. Good thing about the price, though, is that you can throw this frog in the trash as soon as you get it without feeling too bad about getting ripped off. Same goes for the Slingshot Flying Monkey."
5,So much fun!,"I bought two of these slingshot animals for my kids' stockings...and when I tried one out to make sure it worked, I had so much fun that I promptly ordered two more for me and Dad. I anticipate a full family slingshot war on Christmas!"
2,Just not what I thought,"While I realize this is a inexpensive toy and the concept is fun, the item is not what I had in mind. Right out of the bag the left rubber band stretched out longer than the right one and stayed that way. The ""noise maker"" in the body is hard and kind of heavy making this toy not the best for indoor play. Also, out of the first ten or so flings it only croaked maybe once. This is the reason I bought it, I wanted to hear it croak! I know it sounds stupid but I bought these to hand out at a Christmas party because I thought it would be fun but have decided that these would be dangerous and would hurt someone or something. Two stars instead of one because it might make a nice outdoor pet toy but don't expect it to last long."
3,Its OK.,We never really got the hang of shooting it like the picture... and my dog promptly chewed the mech that makes noise.. but she still plays with it...thx
3,"Great idea, in theory.","I bought this frog and a monkey for my boys for Christmas. They are very cute, and very noisy. They are really very cool, until the hands rip off of them. Once that happens, they're pretty much useless. The hands ripped off after using them about 5 times."
2,Slingshot animal dolls,"These toys are fun for about 5 minutes, then the rubber slingshots break. Buying this product is as satisfying and throwing money down a sewer."
2,Frog,disappointed in this toy it is OK for the price but not much fun. It does not compare to the flyiing Monkey whcih makes a screaming jungle sound vice the croaking sound of a frog. Little used.
2,Fun but flimsy,"This is a great concept, however the slingshot part of the frog is not very durable. Unfortunatly within a few shots with the frog the feet detached and it is now just a ribbiting flying frog."
1,DANGEROUS!!,"we have the flying monkey ~FUN AND FUNNY!~ and thought the frog would be good too. after just a few minutes of play, the front legs ripped off and the toy came snapping back into the face of my 5 year old. it left a welt and he cried for a while and came very close to his eye. it sounds like this foot ripping off is a common problem~ i cant believe this company has not discontinued this thing!!"
1,woefully out of date,"This book was published in 2002, yet some of the interviews date back to the late 80's. About 75% took place in 1995 or earlier! All Grisham can talk about is The Firm because the interview took place in 1991.I was also disappointed by the content. I'm a fan of many of these authors because I enjoy reading about the law. These interviews seemed to be almost purely promotional pieces for whatever work the authors had published at the time and referred very little to their legal experiences."
3,Maybe I'm missing the point,"I know several people who have read ""Boy With Loaded Gun"" and they all loved it. I don't share their enthusiasm though. First, the book is depressing ... there is not one individual in the book who I could cheer for or even empathize with. Thus, I found myself often wondering, ""why would someone do that."" If Nordan is not employing a bit of writer's embellishment, I find his memoir very disturbing. Nordan writes very well and that is the only thing that kept me reading, but the lack of any characters with redeeming value was off-putting to me."
3,good...not great,"This was the first I had read of Lewis Nordan, and I wasn't overly impressed.I whipped through the first section about his (or should I say ""Buddy's"") childhood. After that, the book slows down. It becomes increasingly difficult to identify or sympathize with the problems and eccentricities of this young man as he comes of age. Buddy consistently fails to learn from his mistakes and the lack of growth is frustrating as a reader.Still, I'll probably pick up another Nordan book to see if I like it any better."
5,The Life Behind the Fiction,"I have read all of Nordan's previous works and this memoir is up to the same quality. As a memoir, it is not a comprehensive ""then, and then, and then"" recounting of Buddy's life to date. Rather, he chose certain moments or times to exemplify his life. It was also wonderful to discover the man behind the stories. Although not mandatory, I would recommend reading his fiction before this memoir. Buddy, if you read this, I hope you are hard at work on the next book!"
1,nothing secret here,"I've lived on the Outer Banks for only 5 years, and this book had nothing in it that I didn't already know about. Also, most of the ""secrets"" included in this book are restaurants and businesses. Unless you're looking to read advertising disguised as a book, avoid this one."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!,I really enjoyed this book! I bought it one day and had it finished in less than 48 hours! I could really identify with the book. Well written and to the point. I really liked the examples and how you can go about getting out of being in that mode that Mom & Dad established.It is one of the the best books I ever bought and it is worth every penny! Anyone who has had controlling parents should definitely buy the book! Well worth the time and money!
5,Life Changing - Enlightening - Awakening!,"This book is perfect for those who are ready to understand how their parents controlled them so that they may regain control of their own lives. This book is the only book I have read that led me to discover who I really am and want to be. It also helped me to reconsider how I might parent my own children since I have obviously learned unhealthy methods. This book provides practical, therapeutic exercises for those who are ready and willing to go through the pain and joy of discovering life and themselves from a new perspective and helps you understand why you are the way you are. I have recommended this book to therapists for their clients as well as to my friends and family members who had controlling, dysfunctional parents. This book literally changed my life, made me feel lighter as I allowed myself to release the anger and sadness, and showed me a new world I had never seen before."
4,Thank You!,"This book provides tremendous insight for anyone who not only had controlling parents, but who has now become one themselves(ahem). I suppose I have Lisa Kleypas and her latest book to thank. After reading and thoroughly enjoying Blue Eyed Devil, I came across a list of helpful books and links she provided at the end and ""...Controlling Parents...""was one of them.Even if your kids are mostly grown and you are peri-menopausal :) it is not too late to change or to forgive your own parents. Throughout the book Dr. Neuharth's maintains that: ""You are not responsible for what your parents did to you as a child, they are. You are responsible for what you do with your life now, your parents aren't."" The purpose of this book is not to point fingers, but to be aware of the control and how to deal with it. Dr. Neuharth gives real life examples based on people he has interviewed and even though this is an older book, it is still extremely helpful and relevant."
3,Vintage Carry On,"There were only a handful of truly worthy Carry On films, in my opinion, and Carry On Behind is certainly one of them. Even though by this stage the series was missing regulars such as Sid James (I never quite took to him anyway) and Charles Hawtrey, and Dave Freeman had replaced Talbot Rothwell as scriptwriter, Carry On Behind is still one of the greats.The script has Kenneth Williams and guest star Elke Sommer as two archeologists heading up a student dig of Roman remains on a caravan site. There is plenty of toilet humour and double entendres in the usual vein, eliciting as many groans and cringes as laughs."
2,Fresh Peanuts But Too Hard,"Virginia Diner Gourmet Unsalted Virginia Peanuts, 40-Ounce TinI got these peanuts because I am on a salt restricted diet and I love peanuts. Both my wife and I found that the flavor was that of fresh roasted peanuts but the nuts were too hard to chew. I don't have any idea of what was responsible. We will not be purchasing any more. Not recommended"
4,Good gift for mom,"I bought this for my mom on Christmas. While it makes an excellent gift for any mom and is a very cute book, I found many of the pages didn't apply to my relationship with my mother. I also didn't like that there was not an additional page to write a personalized note to mom on like there are in similar books. She still enjoyed the book and I'm glad I got it for her, I only wished more of the book applied to our relationship."
5,Great Alternative,"I have wanted a Dyson since they came out but being the parents of five boys we did not have the extra money to afford one. When I saw that they were being sold as reconditioned at a cheaper price, I jumped at the opportunity. It was the best money that I spent. It has worked like new from day one. I have 9 month old twins that have asthma and they don't have attacks anymore because all of the dust and dog hair is pick up on a daily basis. This vacuum is great and you can't beat the price."
4,Works as advertised...,"Good vacuum cleaner, extremely quiet but would have expected it to be more powerful. Good value at the reconditioned price but unsure if it's worth full price!"
3,Dyson DC-14,"Inadequate suction power. May be because it is a reconditioned product. I don't have enough reference to copare this product, accept to an old Hoover upright vacuum that I have."
2,Not worth $10...,"I've had problems since day one. The brush bar makes a horrible noise, when it will turn on at all. Now it won't even turn any more. I've cleared the bar and there are no impediments - it turns freely, just not when it's on. These problems started within 2 minutes of plugging it in the first time, meaning this is a severe quality issue with Dyson's reconditioned merchandise. Buyer beware!!!I would also note that suction aside, this vacuum has the worst egonomics of any I've used in 20 years. It is clumsy and unwieldy. Pulling out the extension hose is far more complicated than any other vacuum I've ever seen."
5,Great Decision!,"We have nevered owned anything other than the dust-makers from dollar-stores. We had glanced at this line of cleaners, though I personally had issues of dropping that much cash for a vacuum. So, when I stumbled on the refurb - I looked a little closer. It was a good move - very good! The unit looked like new out of the box. No issue getting it together at all.The first time over our carpet was a bit overwhelming. I really don't know what all was in that capture container - but it was scary. Even after going over our floors several times, it still was picking up more than daily traffic dirt. After a week or so, I also noticed that our home didn't have that hint of staleness in the air.Certainly I had high expectations mixed with skepticism. Well, the expectations were met and the skepticisim fled.If you are leaning towards passing on this to stick with the dollar-store brand - I can make you a deal on one! :)Jerry"
5,This vac sucks big time,I have been very pleased with my Dyson. I have a very hairy dog that could give any vacuum a hard work out. I put my Dyson through the wringer and it came out squeaky clean. An excellent buy.
1,Defective Re-conditioned,"I just received my dyson dc14 low reach r/c model. I was so excited to vacuum. But it was broken. The beater bar would not operate so all it wanted to do was act like I was sweeping on un-carpeted floors. No beating action. Amazon has been very good at saying they will send me a replacement, but now I have to wait more and take the vacuum back and it has been a real inconvenience. I hope that the second one works and works longer than 5 minutes."
4,Good deal on Reconditioned Dyson!,I recently purchased the factory reconditioned Dyson low reach vacuum and I've been very happy. I was skeptical of buying reconditioned but I couldn't tell it wasn't brand new. Great Value for the price! It is very quiet and I like the extra long cord.
2,Never Dyson again,"Dyson ran a few months, then brush quit. Dyson said nearest service center that'd honor my warranty is clear across the state (New Jersey) It cost me $20 to mail it there and $20 for the return. (Gas to drive it there would've been more.)Then 3 months later another thing failed--handle doesn't move up all the way. I wasn't about to go another $40 this time. Bought a Kenmore from Sears. They're only 16 miles from here and will take care of me."
5,the best vaccuum if you have pets,"We have a dog that sheds, a lot! So this is a vaccuum that is perfect for us! Just love it and am suprised everytime to see everything it picks up. Vaccuum has run perfectly so far."
5,Better than I had imagined,"In a household with 2 cats and 3 dogs, I never thought I would find a vacuum to pick up EVERY hair in sight. I was wrong! The Dyson rocks!!! I, believe it or not, actually ENJOY vacuuming the house just to see what I can pick up now! It's an adventure each time I use it! I highly recommend this vacuum. It only took a minute to assemble and a few minutes more to master!!"
5,"Barry, Nova Scotia, Canada","The account of Barry, while waiting for the results on his test for HIV, is heartrending. Most of the stories in this anthology of contact with the paranormal are affecting, but Barry's strikes to the soul. Would any of our loved dead come through in our moment of need as his did? We can only hope."
4,It's Statistics need I say more....,It's Statistics and it is a very helpful self taught book to have handy (for when you forget after so many years of not having a Statistics Class).
5,The TRUTH about CANCER,"This book gives an eye opener to the truth about cancer. On the cover it says the answer to cancer has been staring medical science in the face for at least a decade. And the answer is cheap and simple. Therein lies the key. Yes, there is a simple & cheap cure to cancer. The video(2hrs), bearing the same name as his book, will blow your mind and will forever change your thinking about cancer. Demand that Amazon start carrying the video or maybe you can order it from inside the book"
2,"Long, boring book to make just a few (good) points","Even though Al Carter makes some very good points in this book, it could have been written in under twenty pages. I had to skim through 145 pages of useless babble in order to extract the few main points, which are to eat only whole, unpolluted and unrefined foods (no surprise here), exercise on the rebounder, and keep a positive spirit. There--save yourself the bother of reading this book."
5,A must read for everyone!!!,"If you have seen loved ones or friends treated for cancer or die from it, this is absolutely a must read. It speaks for itself."
2,Don't Bother,"One of the most boring books I have ever read. The main character is not particularly likeable and is, in fact, totally unbelievable in certain areas of personality/lack of insight. The plot has gapping holes in it in addition to being terribly predictable."
1,Seems promising...,but is disappointing. I feel like this book might have been rushed to the publisher before it was really reviewed. There is not much character development and thus it is difficult to feel for the main character and then be invested in the book. I did not even bother finishing the last fifteen pages I had left b/c I did not care for Arjie very much. Being as the book presents itself to be about a homosexual boy growing up in a society that sees him as bringing shame to his family name the book hardly deals with this issue. I feel that the majority of the book was dedicated to the political situation in Sri Lanka at the time and less focused on Arjie's conflict of sexuality. This was the author's first novel and unfortunately that comes across.
3,From a child's voice...,"Shyam taught my Prose Workshop class this year in university, which is what led me to read this book.I found it to be quite entertaining and a good read overall. The political angle, while it does not leave any room for debate based on the POV chosen, is gripping. However, Arjie's voice does not seem as sharp by the end of the novel as I would've expected it to be. At the age of 14, he still seems to speak with the same naivite as when he first started speaking in the novel at the age of 7. I assume that this was the effect Shyam was striving for to further illustrate the social situation, but I found it to be a distraction in the novel overall."
4,Disturbingly Interesting,"This novel was beautifully written, and you can feel that the author has poured his heart out when writing this novel. The scenes in this novel sticks with you for a long time, the injustices that is dealt in our world."
3,Funny Boy By Shyam Selvadurai,"Ive only read half the book so far in my 9/10 literature class at Bayswater Secondary College, Australia. At the start it was boring, but then I got into the book and found it quite interesting. I found it a bit hard to understand because it's set in Sri Lanka. One bit I found interesting was finding out he is a bit gay even though he is a little boy."
1,Awful! Awful! Awful! Awful!,"The biography is superb, but the quality is awful and the sound is way below and acceptable rate. I suggest to other Elizabeth Taylor fans, that you don't purchase this item!"
1,horrible!,This can to me rolled up like a log. It does not have a shape and doesn't seem to be able to be shaped into anything that resembles what the picture looks like. A waste of time and money. [...]
1,pond liner,"the pond liner is not somthing you would like to wast your money on.the liner came in a snall box like a ball and when i toke it out it didn'thave any kind of shap.i tryed to fill it up with water and put it in thesun for a hole day but there was no diffrence in it ,it didn't get the shapeand to top it all off thy are charging me 15% pluse shiping to seand it back"
1,Falsly advertised,"This may be Johnson Bros. but NOT ""Johson Bros. made in England""!These are made in China and are not the same quality at all--not even the exact pattern. I was very disappointed. The company accepted the return and credited my credit card account but it was a chore anyway."
5,Surprisingly Good,"Huge Scooby Doo fan. Any Scooby Doo DVD release is heavily anticipated by my kids. Some of their movie choices are difficult to watch but not this one.Aloha has a good story and continues to develope the great characters by continuing to make Daphne smarter and more resourceful rather than the ""dumb,accident-prone, pretty one"" like the 60's show.Overall a very good addition to the series and our collection."
2,Not one of the better Scooby Doo movies.,There wasn't a real plot and the characters were not great either. I was surprised at the quality of this movie. I usually like the movies??
3,Another classic Scooby Case,"My daughter loves Scooby, and this one sticks to the formula that makes scooby so popular. It keeps my kids entertained and that's all that matters!"
3,This is the Warner Bros version versus the MGM version,I bought this for my 3 yr old nephew for his birthday. We were really disappointed to see that this version contains cartoons created by Warner Bros versus the MGM version which had far better sequences and better drawings. My nephew never picked up this DVD after viewing it once. The season two has the MGM cartoon and he has been watching that DVD more often.
5,good laughs!,"Some DVD's were old version and some new. Enjoy the new version, but still miss the old version when i was a kid..."
3,Christmas for Windows Release 3,"Way, way, way older version and not worth the $$ unless you are running Windows 3.1. Please don't buy this--I did and am really sorry I didn't try to send it back to the seller. I did suggest to Amazon they make the information regarding it available to buyers. BAD NEWS PURCHASE"
5,Great title...,"Ah yes, for years I have longed to penetrate Wagner's ring, and this book finally showed me how. I have now penetrated *very* deeply, and it certainly is a good feeling. As with any profound penetration (especially relating to the ring!) it was a little difficult at first, but with a little perseverance I was able to get really lost inside the incredible ring. I don't know how Wagner himself would feel if he were alive today, having his long-impregnable ring so thoroughly penetrated, but I have a feeling the old devil might be satisfied that his monumental ring finally got the treatment it deserves."
4,Hat doesn't match,"The outfit is adorable and my son of 13 months loves it. The only thing that's disappointing to me, is the hat. It doesn't match what is shown and it's to small."
1,"Disorganized, lacking in story, direction","This is a very poorly written book. There is no coherence to it, no direction, no real point."
5,amazing product!,"at first i wasn't so sure about this product. however, after a month of us, i can say that is it the best skin care product i have ever used. the face cream i only use at night, however. i have recommended it to everyone skin problems. it is well worth the try!"
3,Wanted it to Work...,"This product sounded like a fantastic daily cleanser. Unfortunately, for my oily skin it only clogged my pores, the toner stung and the moisturizer was too heavy. Wish it would have worked better- but it definitely did not work any wonders for me."
4,Teenager use,Bought this for my teenage son. Works wonderfully and much cheaper than Dr. Office pricing on same quality item. Doesn't dry him out as most would.
2,The Cleanser and Toner were OK,"I bought this in an attempt to try to get control of a sudden outbreak of moderate acne. The cleanser and the toner were alright but the face cream was way, way too greasy for my skin! My face practically shimmered from all of the grease. Once I switched back to my Clinique oil free lotion I was much happier. Overall, I didn't really notice much of a difference after a few weeks of using just the cleanser and toner so I stopped using it. After doing some reasearch, I found that glycolic acid isn't really that effective against acne since it can't exfoliate inside the pores. Salycilic acid is what you need for that. I'm now using Paula's choice products and my acne is practically nonexistent. This might be useful if you have alot of sun damage (that's what glycolic acid is good for) and I would definitely only recommend the cream for very dry skin."
4,I am pleased,"I really liked this product. I had to start off using it every other day because it did dry my face a little in the beginning. The face cream, I used only as a night cream, because it caused my face to get too oily throughout the day. Be careful in the sun! Make sure you use a high SPF, as the label does warn that your skin is a lot more prone to get sun burn."
4,Good Stuff,"I gave it a 4 only because I've only used it for about 3 weeks now, but so far it's great! Pores are smaller, skin is smoother, surface bumps gone. I like it."
4,Buy this if you're a true metal head,"Well I've never even heard of this band before this weekend, but I'll be buying a lot more of their previous work. This CD was awesome - great variety! The guitars and punishing parts sound like a mix of Behemoth, old school Sepultura, Dimmu...etc...but then out of nowhere, they change up their speed, and sound almost like something 80's. It's weird...but I like it. I hate it when bands just play the same song, and speed over and over again. This is a CD you can listen to from start to finish, and not get bored. Worth buying...as it will be played often."
1,Scratched,The record I received skips! I need to contact the manufacturer to see if I can return it but as of now I am very disappointed with the product.
4,Sturdy plastic case,"I am a fan of Akro-Mils, however this case (Akro-Mils 6215) isn't quite like some of their clear cases. I much prefer the Akro-Mils #5805 and #5905.With that said, this case is a sturdy, larger case with a handle and strong latches. It comes with the same great removable dividers. The bottom of the case is ""more curved/rounded"", so it's not as good for flat/square items. I wish the height of the case was a little higher (maybe 3.5 inches). The current height includes the separate top compartment, which takes away from the size of the main compartment. This top compartment has a ""dual lid"" for tiny items seems, but it's too small to be useful.Overall, the Akro-Mils 6215 Organizer Case is a large, solid case. But try checking out the Akro-Mils 5805 (medium) or 5905 (large) Plastic Parts Storage Cases because they are sturdy and easy to store in a box or on a shelf. I have used these cases for everything from nails & screws to lego bricks."
1,A Waste of Time and Monet,I wondered why no one else has reviewed this waste of time and money. Now I know. Please do not waste your $3.00 which will really not tell you anything about the asssination that a 2 minute review on the Internet cannot. My bad.
4,Hymns: A Portrait of Christ by Steve Green,"I was happy when I finally saw it in my mailbox! Cosmetically though, the sealed VHS had a punched hole on the cover; shipping was longer than I expected, unlike the previous purchase I made of a cassette tape which arrived within 3 days after I ordered it on Amazon. But I'm still glad because my 12-yr-old son who has autism spectrum disorder loves to watch this on tv and would not leave until it's done. So I decided to look for it online so he could have one of his own and watch it anytime he wants. Thank you!"
4,"Raw, disturbing, important",Linda Aceto's collection of poems is a revelation. She is an alchemist transmuting pain and shame into hope and love. Read these astounding poems and be transformed.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I was drawn to this item because of its cheap price and the many different cards it worked with. Well, I used it once and the next time I tried it wouldn't work. After reading some of the reviews on Amazon about how the USB cord was bad, I tried another I had lying around. Low and behold, it worked. I emailed the company asking for the cord to be replaced, and they won't do anything about it. This is a reoccurring issue and the company knows it, but is unwilling to replace their faulty product. Buy another brand for a couple more dollars. You'll be glad that you did."
1,Does not read Smart Media Cards,"Purchase this item solely to read Smart Media Cards as advertised; however, the reader does not have a slot for Smart Media Cards and does not list Smart Media Cards as compatible on the reader itself."
2,No smart media slot.,"I bought it explicitly so that I could transfer files off of an old smart media card, but this doesn't have a slot for that even though it says so in the title."
4,Only One Complaint...,"I got this reader because it advertised that it could read xD cards and SD cards...The reader worked perfectly with my xD card, but my SD card doesn't fit into any of the slots. This really ticked me off because the writing on the actual case says ""SD card 4"" or whatnot... and that's what my card is... only it doens't fit into the slot. I thought perhaps, that the plastic that was inside the case was a protective barrier, so I popped open the case and realised that was a terrile idea and popped it back on.The reader still works, read my xD card, but my SD card won't fit in it. I've had three people try it, and no one can get it to fit and no one knows what that extra slot is for, if not for the SD card.*ugh*"
1,Anything Lower than 1 star?,"When I got the product, one of the outside pins was bent on the CF reader. I had to straighten it before I was able to insert a card. It didn't work.I tried another card in one of the other slots and it still didn't work.I never called the company or tried to return it because it wasn't worth the effort.This reader is junk. Consider it a gamble if you order one."
3,Not what I thought it was going to be,It was not what I thought it was going to be but I did not read the description properly. not their fault.
2,Not What advertised!!!!!,"The adapter/reader was very good. BUT, where it advertised 23 in one capabilities, it was actually closer to 13 in 1. It also APPEARS in the Ad to have an adapter that expands it to a larger size, not included. It also says that it is BLUE, it was not, was actually a Dark gray. When I complained to the Shipper, I immediately received a FULL REFUND and did not have to send back. I found a friend that could use it."
1,semi functional at best,This product is poorly made. Card and USB cable slots are all very touchy. Connections are so flaky that a nearby oscillating fan would cause a break in connection when the air was blowing in the direction of this item. I was able to get it to work long enough to download a few photos but is not serviceable as a regular use option.
1,meh.,"You're better off buying better quality. I got what I paid for. the pins on the reader are fragile, and if you try inserting a memory card and don't get it exactly perfect, you will mangle one of those pins, and that's all it takes to send this thing to the trash can. It did work for the three uses I got out of it before I bent the pin and could no longer use it."
1,cheep product,"I bought this because it was cheap and I should have read the reviews first. I cannot get it to work on my computer at home, but it will work on my computer at work, which is a pain if I want to get pictures of my memory card on the weekend. It it cheaply made and feels like it could fall apart at any time."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I bought this because it reads CF and SD cards, for my two digital cameras, and because it was cheap. It works fine, except that it's really hard to line up the pins for the CF card, so it takes a few minutes to insert and you risk bending the pins. It's also hard to determine which card should go in which slot without picking it up and taking a good look at the front edge where they're inserted.Overall, pretty cheaply made, but it works fine for me so far."
2,Card Reader Design flawed.,"I bought this for 2 reasons: One of the few readers that support both CF and SD memory cards, and 2. Suprisingly cheap.Well, you get what you pay for. The design is Ok, and the SD slot works fine. However the CF slot guides are not aligned with the pins, and it's easy to insert the card mis-aligned. IMO it's a matter of when (not if) I'll insert the CF card into the slit and have it bend a pin, but for now I'll be careful. The price makes these comments almost mute."
1,Does NOT Read Smart Media.,The description says it reads Smart Media -it does not. The only reason I bought it was to read the Smart Media cards from my older Olympus camera. CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION!!!
2,"Reads card, but required modification: Poor design","The unit does read the cards it advertises, however the plastic housing is designed such that the slot for the XD card is slightly too small. I had to cut out the plastic on the right side of the XD slot in order to insert the card. Once this was done, the card worked just fine. It appears that the CF slot has the same issue, but only from visual inspection since I have no CF card to test. It works, but not without some modification. They should re-design the housing to have the correct slot sizes. It's just a bad design/manufacture of the housing."
1,CF socket pastic broken on first insertion,"the CF socket's plastic guide broke on insertion of a CF card. i've used a couple of other multi-format flash memory readers and have had no problems, so i don't think it's because i'm clumsy. (i bought this one for SDHC support.) since this was less than $3, it's probably not worth the trouble / postage to try to get a refund; rather, i'll just get a different and hopefully more robustly constructed multi-format flash reader from somewhere else."
4,"Great for the price, works on Vista","Great product for the price. Be careful, you can put a card in backwards and damage it. Put the card in slowly your first time and write a note on it. Works perfectly with no drivers."
2,Bargaincell sent me substitute brand that did not work.,"My review was for the Eforcity brand, but I found that Bargaincell had sent me a substitute brand. Disregard this review."
1,"won't read CF 4, 8 gig cards","The thing only works erratically, and reads only my 1 gig Compact Flash cards, not my 4or 8 gig CFs. Definitely not recommended."
1,Never worked,"Installed it on the computer, it didn't read the memory card. Tried a different memory card, same thing, nothing. Wasted my money on this.."
2,Cheap Isn't Always Better,"This trimmer just isn't of good quality. The plastic is very cheap, and I had a hard time trimming anything. Invest in a better quality trimmer."
3,Good but not perfect,"Considering that the Malay language is one of the simplest language in the world for English speakers, you would expect this method to be close to perfect. It is far from it. There are a number of mistakes. Some new words are not explained. Some exercises are simply impossible given the vocabulary of the preceeding lessons. It looks like it has been made of bits and pieces put together but not necessarily connecting with each other. That being said, it will still achieve its goal of teaching you a fairly decent level of Malay quickly."
2,Could really use some proof-reading,"The exercises expect the student to know grammar and vocabulary that hasn't yet been covered, which makes it frustrating and unnecessarily difficult. Sometimes a word is given in the chapter vocab notes, and then a different word (synonym) is used in the exercises. That should have been fixed by a proof-reader prior to publication. The authors have tried hard - successfully so - to make the exercises interesting, relevant and modern but a beginner who has no experience of learning a foreign language will struggle with this book.I only bought the book, not the companion CDs/cassettes."
3,The Tiki Bar Is Open,The Tiki Bar Is Open being Hiatt's 16th studio album and it was released 2001 and was his last record with Vanguard records. Hiatt has here created a straight forward rock album with similair style lyrics. The album itself is not bad but I have heard this so many times so it sounds a bit generic at times. It sounds like Dylan without having Dylans quality of lyrics or melody. The booklet is very nice and has an Hawaii feel to it. All the lyrics are included and we get a list of whom plays what on the album. Allmusic gave the album 3.5/5 which is slightly higher then my grade. 3/5.
5,another great album,"John Hiatt continues to put out fantastic music , if you like his older music , you will love this album ."
4,My First John Hiatt purchase...,"While waiting on something new from Sonny Landreth and the Goners, I decided to purchase a John Hiatt cd. I chose this one and am not disappointed. Good lyrics, music and musicians.I love the reflective lyrics of ""my old friend"" and the lyrics of ""all the lilacs in ohio""I will be purchasing more of Hiatts music. It's just the right combo of blues, folk, rock and roll that I love. Heck, the 70's were my favorite era of music.""Farther Stars"" is kinda a hippy-trippy song that reminded me of the Beatles. (I miss George Harrison.)And I thought it was their way of paying tribute to one who has offered so much to the music world we know and love today, while not losing individuality."
4,4 1/2 Stars! A great new disc from John Hiatt,"The folks over at Capitol didn't know what they were missing when they balked at this album! Luckily enough, Vanguard was smart enough to pick up John Hiatt and let him do the kind of music he wanted. What a GREAT disc! This is probably one of his most listenable albums to date. While this disc has a fresh sound, fans of his classics such as Bring the Family or Slow Turning won't be disappointed either....this one has more in common with those two than it does with say, Little Head or Walk On for instance. It's got a bunch of great songs to turn up loud and cruise down the road....but it's also got some great, thoughtful slow tunes as well. A definite must have for any Hiatt fan (new or old)!"
2,New Lo for Hi att,"I too am a long time JH Fan...I even tried playing this CD several times.. Hoping it would click and it would bring me the excitement that much of his other work had. It is passable Hiatt.. with the exception of ""Farther Stars"" which started making me queezy.Couldn't wait for this to come out, very disapointedBuy Crossing Muddy Waters..Slow Turning, Perfectly Good Guitar, Stolen Moments, Bring the Family, . John deserves your money.. just not for this CD."
4,Classic Hiatt,"Hiatt always surprises me. His growth has an artist as been evident in the past few years, ranging from ""Walk On"" to ""Little Head"" and ""Crossing Muddy Waters"". Now, Hiatt returns with a vibe that reminded me a lot of ""Perfectly Good Guitar"", but with an eye on the romantic side.Whether it's from the steering wheel thumping rhythms of ""Everybody Went Low"" to the reflective ""I'll Never Get Over You"", Hiatt has really come into his own lyrically. My personal fave from this CD is ""All The Lilacs In Ohio"". The first time I Heard this, I found myself bouncing around in the car while driving.This is a great CD to put in the player, head out on the highway, and just cruise to."
4,Missing map,Just a note: On my copy there is a statement on the page that shows the copyright info that there is a system map printed on the end pages. However no map is there. I don't know if this was a printing error or whether there was a last-second change of plans (perhaps the map was not completed in time?).
3,Requesting a repair,This is a nice unit and easy to install. We have been using it two weeks at our small business and the talk/video button is broken. We just contacted the support dept. requesting a repair or exchange as it does hold a 1 year warranty. I'll post again to let you know how the service/support department handled our problem.
1,Very bad performance product,"I was very disappointed with this product. Everything feels cheap, and it also functions that way.Maybe it's just my specific product, but the picture quality is really, really bad. You can hardly say it's a color monitor. Even dark blue colors look white. It makes me wonder how they created the product images...The angle of the camera is ridiculous. The camera must be placed in front of the person to see him right. I thought I could place it aside the door, but then you will not see your guest. They say it has tiltable camera lens, but actually, you can tilt it only vertically. Changing the position horizontally ends up with a picture of your guest profile.There is no option to change the volume of the doorbell or to disable it.To make it worse, when you turn on the camera, it makes a sound on the outside unit, making sure the person know that you are looking at him...It is so bad that I've decided to put it aside until some other use arise."
1,Don't buy SVAT!!!!,"Unit never worked from day 1. I called SVAT numerous times and they would say try this, then try that, and then try ....try.... tryyy and it never worked. Finally they said you are out of warranty and out of luck. I said I have been talking to you all along. They said show us the correspondences. I said it was by phone, and they said too bad it was not written down you are out of luck. Well they got 100's of my dollars and I got a bunch of headaches and a worthless product. Never buy any SVAT because you'll be stuck with nothing, just money out the door......."
4,"Great, but had to be replaced once","The great thing about this product is the 2 wire system, that simply connected using the same wiring that we already had for our doorbell. The ease of use is excellent. Has provided a lot of security, especially for our secretary who may be alone in the building at times. I liked it so much that when the one that we had originally purchased broke (after warranty), I bought and paid for a second one."
3,Correlle--,Missed having the 20-piece set which includes the lunch plate. Also would like to be able to order glassware with it. not available
5,I needed a change.,"I have had Corelle Livingware dishes for almost 15 years and I was tired of the pattern. My set was still a complete set. So I packed up my ""old"" pattern, gave it to my sister, and ordered new. These seem to be up to the standards of my old set, and look so pretty on my table.I recommend these as an everyday set to anyone looking for new dishware.I am very happy with my new set. (I purchased 2 so would have a service for 8). Am now getting the serving pieces to go with it."
3,OK for every day use,"If they had coffee mugs, and bowls with same design it would have been a perfect set even when you have company over."
3,Apricot Grove pattern of Corelle Livingware,I do like Corelle Livingware but the pattern is not the same color as the picture. All washed out color and showed cups being a different color than white
4,Corelle Livingware,"Look, color and quality of dishes are as expected. I did have a problem with the shipping, the first set of dishes had some broken dishes. I reported the problem and I received the second set of dishes within 2 days, some of those dishes were also broken, however I was able to combine the two sets and have my full set of dishes."
2,Corelle Apricot Grove 16 pc Set,"This was a Christmas gift. We are very displeased with this set, almost returned it. The dinner and desert plates are Corelle Apricot Grove, the coffee mugs are STONEWARE and the bowls are Corelle, but of a totally different pattern. Yes, the product description does say that, but I'm used to searching for a product and getting an exact match. I could of, and SHOULD HAVE gone to WalMart and purchased itthere for $10 less."
2,"Good Details, Lousy Fiction","While I found the details about C.I. and the war in Iraq interesting, as a novel this book reads like an army field manual. Cliched characters, plodding plot, a dull protagonist, little suspense, etc. I got about two-thirds of the way through the book and decided to toss it. I got to where I just didn't care any longer about any of the characters or the plot. I sense the author didn't care either."
2,Interesting...but nah,"I found this book interesting solely because I've been to many of the places DeBatto mentions. Like he says, Warhorse is a hellhole, as is much of that part of east-central Iraq. Having said that, however, I find myself in agreement with many of the other reviewers in that his writing appears amateurish at times. As with many (but by no means all) books written by former non-commissioned officers, this book appears written in training manual-format. The gee-whiz computer goodies are interesting but the characters lack development and the dialogue isn't realistic (aside from the description of Camp Warhorse...). Would I read it again? No. Would I give his later books a shot to see if he's improved any? Yeah, maybe."
4,Go behind the scenes of a counterinsurgency,"Painstaking intelligence based upon the development of a network of reliable sources is the key to any counterinsurgency effort and Debatto has ""been there and done that"" in Iraq. Sometimes fiction is the best way to present truth and this book drives home truths about the intelligence war in Iraq: how intelligence can and should be gathered, how mutual trust with locals is the only way to develop reliable information, and how success often walks a fine line between traditional police skills and traditional military skills. For a shorter ""factual"" version of what the CI guys are up to read the Wall Street Journal article by Greg Jaffe called ""Intelligence Test"" dated 10SEP04. Debatto's book is fiction but it rings true. I'm looking forward to his next title, CI: Dark Target."
1,Awful,"I read 75 to 100 books a years, and as many magazines. I seldom fail to finish a book, and cannot remember the last time I not only failed to finish a book, but threw it in the garbage before the first 100 pages. Save your time and your money."
1,don't be fooled,"Although the description promises full color plates that can be used to test for colorblindness, all I received was a book full of gray dots! i purchased this to try and self-diagnose and am disappointed to find out that none of the pages are in color."
5,My Most Treasured Book Since 1975,The pictures in this book brilliantly inscribe into my brain a subject thought to be difficult. Still my most treasured book in this 2013 future. I use the pictures to help me move into a universe where I solve my most current life problem. Imagining my future and past through the intelligent graphics is fun and rewarding.
2,"a good beginner cookbook, but a little bland","This is a good cookbook for the beginner chef. Recipes are pretty straight forward if bland. If you have any cooking experience, this cookbook will be a bit boring. A great cookbook is the Bride & Groom First and Forever Cookbook. Very tasty!"
4,Good basic for your cookbook shelf,"I received this book as a gift from my sister-in-law in anticipation of my wedding last summer. It's a great resource for cooking newbies, with thorough instructions and tips on how to set a table, basic preparations, colored charts on cuts of meat, vegetables, noodles, etc.My favorite part of this book is probably the side boxes that show three pictures of a finished product--for instance, cookies--that show how it should look when finished and a couple of bad results with tips on troubleshooting.This book may be a little *too* basic for those with cooking and baking experience, but it's a great reference tool or first cookbook. By no means is it comprehensive in its inclusion of recipes, either; rather, it includes basics and some ""quick"" solutions that are friendly to non-cooks. For a little more depth, I recommend the original Joy of Cooking. Nonetheless, the new bride in your life will surely enjoy this nicely packaged resource for her first kitchen."
4,Comprehensive - Easy to Follow,"I just bought this book a couple of weeks ago and have to say that it is the best cooking book I have ever seen so far. Me and my wife are cooking fanatics who like to spend time trying out new recipes all the time. Great recipes, easy to follow instructions and a lot of useful information. I strongly recommend it!"
5,Angle jacks,"This product not only makes cables look neat, it takes away unsightly bends and keeps the cable tight against the wall."
2,Signal Degradation,Yes these 90's tidy up the wall but they do not work well for me in applications requiring a strong clear signal such as digital HD cable boxes. The connector seems to play well in my office where the coax run is used only for a cable modem. I question the signal degradation these adapters may be causing downstream.
5,outstanding!!,"It would be hard to discount Augustus Pablo's contribution to reggae music and specifically his influence on dub. He is known for being an innovative dub artist, but is really much more than that. Earth's Rightful Ruler showcases his considerable abilities outside of the realm of dub music. This is a largely instrumental outing (Hugh Mundell does some chanting and there is some spoken word by Pablo and various backing vocals) where the melodica takes command of the ""vocal"" part, and the result is incredible music! Every single song is exceptional, and the musicians who contribute to the project comprise a Who's Who of Reggae Music. The liner notes claim that the album is produced by Jah Rastafari - Haile Selassie I and co-produced by Augustus Pablo, and I have little doubt that the spirit of H.I.M. is being channeled through Pablo. Buy it!!"
5,Great book,This bok is really great. It compares and contrasts the knowledge behind science and faith. You don't get to see this much in today's learning environment.
5,New Edition,"This book is a newer edition (2003) of the other Amazon listing.Good book, really shows some thoughtful insight on how Christians can percieve evolution and other issues in Biology."
3,Book review,"It was the wrong edition. It worked for a while, but I had to go out and buy the new edition anyway. It's unfortunate, but not a huge deal because of how low the price was to begin with."
4,Fun and Funny,"I got tremendous joy from this book on the first reading, but have found myself returning to it less and less. Most of the parodies are wonderful, some are tedious. The question one occasionally must ask is: what is the point of parodying something not worth reading in the first place? A lot of cleverness and poetic skill though and most of the originals are worth at least one perusal. The supreme highlight for me was the parody of ""Macavity, The Mystery Cat"" by TS Elliot, which is a hilarious poem to start with. The parody is ""The Accounting Cat"" and should not be missed. Well if you feel reading poetry is getting too stodgy, lighten things up with this one."
1,Item is complete garbage,"The item is a complete piece of garbage. Packaged in a Plastic bag with little plastic arms, guaranteed to arrive broken. Look for a better quaity piece, guess you get what you pay for."
2,Fluff,There is not a lot worth watching in regards to this movie unless you want to see Lucy Gutteridge (female lead in Top Secret) nude in a bath tub for a few seconds. This is the story of a man who works to stop poachers. Gutteridge plays the love interest. There is some nice footage of Africa but little else.
3,Losses time,"Even with winder overnight, losses time routinely. Nice looking, but can't rely on it giving me the correct time. Will never buy a self-winder again."
1,sizing issues,I received the shipment on time. However I ordered a ladies medium and it was too small. It fit my 60lb eight year old son perfectly. I was very disappointed.
3,Good knife but thick handle,This is a good looking knife with a sharp blade. It would be a perfect pocket knife if the handle were not so thick. The handle is 14mm wide. This is just enought to put a buldge in your pocket. By conteast a knife by Victornox with an identical length blade has a width of 9.5mm.
5,Buck Bantam Folding Knife,"I have been quite satisified with my new Buck Knife, it is sharp and it is easy to carry. I was shocked when I looked at the blade and saw ""Made In China"" on a Buck knife. I used to live two blocks from the original Buck factory in El Cajon, California, and visited several times and never saw ""China"" on anything.Ray in Colorado"
4,Size doesn't matter,"Seemed a little small at first, but now I really like the size. Perfect size. Fits fine in my pant's front pocket - without an uncomfortable bluge or weight. Also is very sharp. Everyone should have one."
4,Rugged Buck for the price,"I was taken back by the size of the Bantam, it is a little small, and it is made in China. But this knife shows no sign of inferior craftsmanship. It came to me razor sharp, and for the price this throw-away is a perfect everyday knife for rugged purposes. I took it out camping with me and carved shotgun slugs out of a tree, cooked and ate steaks with it (Not in that order, of course), I cut and honed branches, turned screws, have pounded it into stumps, and cut open innumerable packages with this and it is still razor sharp with absolutely no nicks. This is a testament to Buck, and whether it be foreign or domestically made, I'm reaching for a Buck, especially this little surprise."
3,"Good for average daily use, not for heavy use...","I've had this knife for 10 months now. When I first got it it was fairly hard toopen with one had with out your thumb slipping of the stud. It half way opens thenit gets easy to open the rest over the way. The blade had no play from side to side or up and down when new. After 10 months it has gotten some side to side play. The up and down lock up is stillvery tight. the tip of the knife is needle sharp. The very tip will bend over and after alot of use it will wear down to a good point. The blade steel is nothing special. It will dull when using it onhard material (plastics, hard wood, nylon rope, ect) but it sharpens easily in little time.I really wish it had a pocket clip. Mine falls out of my pocket alot.Once I loose this one, I'll likely move up to a little better model.For the price I do believe it to be VERY good and will tackle most daily task with relative ease."
4,Inexpensive but sharp,Straightforward knife that is about as big as you would want to go in your pocket. The one hand open is smooth and works well. Lock open is solid. You will likely want to use both hands to close.This knife is sharp! Eats through cardboard and packing tape. Not for the extra clumsy as I have drawn blood twice with very light pressure (once with the point and once with the edge).I think I payed around $10 and am almost thinking of grabbing a few more encase I forget to put this in my carry on when I go on my next airline flight. ;-)
2,Lock Back Not.,"I always purchased Buck knives for their quality and safety. The lock back knife I purchased does not lock back and is dangerous. It has made in USA on blade, but I wonder if it is made in China?"
4,Buck Small Bantam,"This lockback exceeded my expectations. It is light, sturdily built, and easy to open & use. The release is well-positioned for ease of one-handed closing. The blade is a useful thickness, sharpness, and design. The pivot is robust, and the knife seems well assembled (no east-west or north-south movement of the blade when open)."
3,Does not hold edge well,"I bought mine at local farm & fleet as a utility knife. Fits great in my pocket. Very light. You wont know it's even there. But this Buck does not hold an edge well. I seem to sharpen it constantly since I like my knives razor sharp. I bought a Case XX today from Tractor Supply to replace this Buck, since I am disappointed. Case XX was much sharper out of box. But cost $30. Case XX does not have locking blade, however. I hope I like it better than this Buck Bantam it is replacing."
2,Small and hard to hold,"The image of the knife looks very impressive but this knife is much smaller than it appears. The biggest complaint I had was the handle was made of hard plastic and I never felt like I had a solid grip on the thing. Unless my hands were warm and a bit moist, it always felt like I could drop it or cut myself trying to open the thing. Other than that the blade is quality and sharp."
2,"Needs some improvement,","I got this knife because of the look, it has nice lines and nice looking blade, but that is about all that it has got going for it. It does not stay sharp, it has play side to side, the handle wont take much abuse. This is a nice office knife good for opening letters, cutting some string, carving a desk. Its a good starter knife but its not a solid built. I have an older buck lite 442 and its way better than this knife. I am kind of dissapointed with Buck on this one."
4,"For the price, this knife is OK. Cheap Plastic handle","It's small enough to be pocket knife, easy to carry around and not hard to switch out the blade. Only complain is the handle is quite cheap."
5,Love it!,this knife came in 3 days which was super fast. the package was well protected which is another plus and the knife is great. its super easy to open and close and its really sharp too. overall i think it was a great buy.
4,The perfect Pocket knife,"I purchased this Buck Lock Blade Pocket knife for my daughters boyfriend as a birthday gift.He likes the size, light weight, quality blade, and the fact it is a Buck.A reasonably priced knife made in America."
5,Excellent research material,I am currently engaged in an MBA dissertation on the state of MBA programmes and found the referrals to companies as brands very helpful. The book clearly sets out the marketing of a service brand and contains many helpful hints that are not repeated in other texts. The book is easy to read without being superficial.I look forward to reading other material by these authors.
3,A Passion for Art,"Reading this book is like sitting in a room with a very old and rich man to hear him discuss that part of his life devoted to collecting, and later giving away, paintings by fresh and talented American artists. Some of the tales are interesting and some are important only to the old man. On balance your time is well spent. His advice directed to new collectors is especially good. The Conables have done a nice job in helping Mr. Neuberger's informed thoughts on art reach the printed page."
2,Biased opinion,A biased author who had a problem with the constitution and freedom of religion. The animosity wreaked in each page and chapter.
1,Thanks for the fodder,"Walter Martin undercuts his agenda greatly with this book. When arguments like his are so easily blasted out of the water, it serves to undermine the effectivness of all attacks on Latter Day Saint belief. For this I am grateful! Its like serving up a hanging curveball to Sammy Sosa. His legitimacy is going, going, gone!"
5,Furnace draft Inducer,This purchase was by far the best purchase I have made on Amazon. The description of this part and the specifications were right on the money. It actually took me 30 minutes to repair my furnace and get it back running again. The part fit the opening and actually is quieter than the original part. Our furance is like new again and running great! $110.00 vs. $600.00 from the furnace repair company. What a deal!
5,a standard at its time.,This was one of the best books written on the subject when it was published. It had data in it not found in other books. I highly recommend it to anyone's library.
3,A wide spectrum of Bloch's works,"This anthology is a fairly diverse collection of short stories written by Robert Bloch (author of ""Psycho""). A few stories into the book, and you will understand why Bloch has been called the king of the shock endings. You will soon find yourself attempting to guess how Bloch will finish off the tale you are reading, and you will be right about seventy-five percent of the time. Does this harm the stories themselves? In a way, much as it would if you were reading a book entitled ""100 Stories In Which The Hero Turns Out To Be A Vampire.""Still, several stories do manage to chill despite this failing, and they are superb examples of Bloch performing in top form."
2,DOWNHILL IN A HURRY...,This CD compiles Rhinoceros's second and third albums into one completely unnecessary release. Their second alb (Satin Chickens) was a very weak rehash of their debut; their third alb (Better Times Are Coming) featured a stripped-down band with only a few of the original members left and bears almost no resemblence to the original group's music. Forget this CD and get their fine first one and you'll have everything you need by this band.
1,God is a Big Fat Liar,"It is poorly written, poorly edited and the author rambles aimlessly. In my opinion the author is trying to set himself up as a guru or new cult leader."
2,Poor Quality Black and White Photos,"The information about the animals is very complete, but the poor quality black and white photos make this a poor reference guide."
2,Waste of Money,"Absolutely zero benefit from Blu-Ray on a movie like this, not to mention this movie just flat out stinks. I am all about the serious drama, but this was the serious sleeper, as in I could not stay awake..."
2,Big waste!,I thought this movie was horrible. The only salvation for the movie was Hayden Panettiere's acting skills. Her Looks don't hurt either. I would not buy it because of that. T he gay sex scene was absolutely horrible.
2,Bette kept it from boring me to tears,"It's not that it didn't stand the test of time, it's just for me Leslie Howard is about as exciting as watching mold grow (for the record I didn't like him in Gone With The Wind either. It's not that Bette Davis was that good, it's just Howard was so bad he made her look good.I know I live in a different age, when teeth are so white they are blue but I couldn't get over how bad Leslie Howards teeth were. I was so zoned in I kept straying to the thought, my gosh his breath must be killer and they must be hurting him and thats whey he keeps his mouth closed.Plus after a while you just wanted to slap Leslie Howards character for being so stupid."
1,Flimsy,Wished I did not purchase since it comes so easily apart. Not really what I had in mind when I bought.
3,Bachmann Train depot,Support for canopies is poor. gluing is difficult because of the inadequate support for the canopies.
2,unnecessary,"Mostly just a plot summary and list of characters. A few essays describe topics that should be largely self evident to an adult reader. I was hoping for more explanations (footnotes) on Waugh's many culural, social and historical references to supplement my reading of the book."
4,Imperial Chinese Military History: 8000 BC -1912 AD,"I found this book on sale as an ebook for my kindle, so I bought. I've read other books dealing with Chinese warfare and mititary history. This one is not bad. It gives a good overview of China's military history, but its not perfect. The author is not able to read Chinese, but uses books and articles already translated/writen in English. I think that it's a good read, but an expert, like Ralph D. Sawyer, on Chinese history with knowledge of the Chinese language would have done a better job. This would be a good book for the general military history fan, much like the author, who heard about Sun Tzu and wanted know more. I recommend it."
1,Soleus LX-120 One summer is all you get,We purchased this portable air conditioner to make it through the heat waves here in Northern California. It worked one season. It rattled toward the end of the season and got louder and louder. This season it would not even come on. My husband opened it up and the gray plastic fan inside it is destroyed. We are over the warranty period so hoping we could fix ourselves. I called customer service. You must have a certified HVAC person order the part. They will not sell parts to customers!!! Avoid this product!!! Get a window unit.
3,"Good, but with errors","Overall this book is very good, but there are quite a number of errors, both of explanation, inconsistency and simple proofing.My wife is Spanish, so I was able to verify with her.Learning a language is difficult enough without a text book introducing errors!"
4,Promising,"I've just started this book, but it seems clear that if you use it regularly, there's a path there to be much more proficient and comfortable with Spanish.Audio-only approaches, while helpful, do leave you floundering with verb endings and tenses, which do a lot of the heavy lifting in Spanish.This is exactly what I was looking for."
2,"If you don't buy the TI-83 Plus for Dummies book, you will not get this one.","If you don't buy the TI-83 Plus for Dummies book, the TI-84 Plus book won't do you any good. There are way TOO many references to the TI-83 book and the book is written in a way that implies you spent the money to upgrade to a TI-84+, rather than buying the TI-84+ out right.Save your money, unless you agree that spending the money for both books is a good deal."
1,This Book is Downright Terrible,"I have literally not gotten one single answer out of this book. It is a dark unholy thing...just lurching into the night. Even the index is terrible in that it is extremely limited. There is not even an entry on how to use logorithmic functions. I have literally had way better luck pressing buttons in all kinds of combinations to slowly figure out how to use my graphing calculator. Even the manual that came with the unit is way better than this book.If you buy this rotten book, then plan to take up smoking. You will need to because it is extraordinarily stressful to try and find a single answer to anything out of this rotten text."
2,"TI-84 book is just the +1, missing MANY TI-83 topics","Author is good, subjects are covered well. The issue is w/ WHAT IS LEFT OUT! Why, besides greed, did the publishers think we should also have to buy the TI-83 book? I didn't have to purchase two calculators. They offer a download option for some missing information, which is great, so we know it's possible. Why not offer up the missing (and there are many) topics. Topics like complex numbers, financial calculations, logs and natural logs. We all understand that to keep the costs and pages down some topics are omitted, but come on, it costs what to post them on your site. Bottom line, this book will assist you if you're new to TI-8x products, but don't expect too much. Also expect to walk away w/ a bad taste in your mouth from the Dummies."
5,Helpful and easy to read,This book is so helpful! I often find instruction manuals confusing and this book is so much easier to use than the manual that came with the calculator. It is easy to read and the format makes it simple to find the topic you need. I am taking introductory statistics and the stats info helped me study for my test. This book is excellant and very easy to use.
1,Save your manual,"And save your money as this book is poorly written and you will need your TI-84 manual to get started. Many of the commands given do not work. I stopped using it and went to an algebra text book and a web site. This is my first and last book of the ""for dummies"" series that I will waste my money on."
2,Depends what UR looking for,"Should have I known it was not application-driven, I would have not bought it. It says to be process-driven however some examples are wrong, the sequence of operations does not get the results on the book."
5,Very helpful,"My daughter needed the calculator for school. This book has been of great help to maximize the use of the calculator. Price was good, and we enjoyed free delivery. The overall experience was great. I ordered other products; the package was received as promised without damages. Thank you."
1,Lacking,"This book is seriously lacking in information. If you need a guide to help you in actually accomplishing something, choose a different book."
2,Rather boring for a vampire murder mystery,"Based on the plot description, you'd think this would be at least an interesting read. Instead, the plot meanders around without any sense of authorial control, and the characters are cardboard. There are several subplots, one involving the daughter of a murdered executive seeking revenge, one involving something called the focus, which gives its recipients supernatural powers, and one involving the turning of vampires and a strange little cult. Not one of these is handled well, and about halfway through I simply lost interest and put the book down. Not recommended."
3,It's fine for limited use,"I was having a lot of stretching pains because I was carrying so low. I wanted something to support my belly and this worked just fine. The sizing is completely off by about 50-80 lbs....so make sure you buy one to two sizes larger than the weight stated.Again, a simple product that works well while walking, but sitting down with it is a bit uncomfortable. After a few weeks, it just became a hassle and I stopped using it."
3,Decent for the price,"I researched quite a few maternity belts, really unsure of what route to take. I spotted this mini cradle and read the reviews and thought I'd give it a go. To me the price fits the comfort level. At $15, the cradle was itchy and uncomfortable. (Although I can't imagine many maternity belts being comfortable) I can tell a slight difference when wearing this as opposed to not. I've been fortunate not to have much back pain this late in the game (35 weeks) but the maternity belt does not help with hip pain and pelvic pressure. I'm sure this would suit someone best with significant back pain."
1,Didn't do much,I would not recommend this small belt. I would recommend the wider ones to give more support on the stomach. This one was too skinny and didn't give me any support.
1,Be Forewarned!!,"Although the wording and description states this is pure essential oil, I saw on the label when I received it that it is a synthetic chemical, NOT true essential oil. It did not function the same way as the genuine oil either, and when I sent a complaint to the company twice, I was completely ignored. I'm primarily upset that they can falsely advertise it to be something it's not. Beware of this company's products . . . ."
1,Synthetic oil,I can not truthfully give this more than one star. What I thought was the real thing turned out to be synthetic. I will not be buying anything from this vender again.charly
4,Encyclopedia of ASP.NET,"Wrox is a great publisher of quick and massive volumes with multiple authors. I'm a teacher and look for good values that combine clear technical information and a broad range for a low cost. This is a good choice if you have experience with ASP.NET, know your web architecture (query strings, cookies, sessions, etc.), and don't want an extended tutorial. The reasoning for why you use these things wasn't clear but the details on how to use them exceeded most of the current fare which is why I chose to teach from the text recently. The quantity of code that was provided in VB and C# was excellent but the topics were out of order for classroom use. For the ASP.NET beginner, I feel it needs to be supplemented with a more tutorial based text and then this makes an excellent companion volume."
4,Comprehensive but not in depth,"This is a nice book for people who have the basic idea of ASP.NET. This Book covers almost all topics for .Net2.0 . It is a very good reference book for newbie.Unfortunately, this book isn't in-depth for lots of topics, basically it just introduces most common cases, and you probably can't find what you want for some topics. (Eg implement Sorting and Pagation for ObjectDataSource, Crystal Report, memory management, ADO.NET in depth, .Net Virtual Machine etc). The source code is another down side for this book. Most of the code doesn't run, also the connection string wasn't right at the first place, I have to spend hours and hours to get it right.In conclusion, it worth to buy, if you just want learn asp.net in a fast way. It will give you the solution for most tasks. Pretty good reference book."
4,"Good book, no e-book","This is a good book to learn version 2.0. Well written, real world examples. Title says professional but beginners would like it as well. One disappointment for me was the accompanying CD only has marketing for other books, no e-book."
1,Not worth any amount of money,"It is actually amazing how horrible this mirror is. Really. Should be a simple product, right? What's wrong with it? Well, fit, optical quality, and stability: 1) On my 1985 Toyota 4Runner which it is designed for, it didn't fit properly (I had to trim the rubber pad that goes between the mirror and the door to make it fit). 2) You can't see *anything* out of the mirror... it is so wavy and distorted it's impossible to actually see anything behind you. 3) The mirror is so loosely mounted on it's mounting stalk that it literally gets moved *by the wind* as you go down the road, much less if you brush by it or try to brush snow off it.DON'T BUY THIS MIRROR... save yourself the headache and find a used OEM Toyota mirror, that's what I had to do, $20 later."
5,Soundtrack and powerful musical performance,"Tom Juravich's powerful collection of traditional and newer songs about the life of coal miners is a testament to the human ability to overcome dangerous working conditions, fatigue and low wages by banding together and working for a common goal. In ""Breaker Boy"", Juravich addresses the problems of child labor in the mines. ""The Coal Tattoo"" speaks to the danger and allure of mining life. This is a soundtrack to the award-winning film, ""Out of Darkness, the Mine Worker's Story"". Tom Juravich, who also works as a university professor when he is not recording or giving performances, has captured the traditions and aspirations of the American worker in this CD."
3,"Well padded, but too small","The case seems to be well constructed, but my saxophone didn't fit. It is a 30 year old Bundy and the bell came up a bit higher that the case had room for. Also, the case was too short to leave the ""fuzzy bopper"" in."
4,Love the bag,I live in an urban environment where I often ride my bike everywhere. This was a great bag for that purpose. It fits like a backpack and holds the saxapone snugly.I am not so sure it is durable enough to travel on an airplane with it though. Not too much padding.
2,The title is deceptive.,"This video is more of a promotion for the opening of Denver's International Airport than an airshow video. The background music for the acts showcased is too low-key, with the effect that very exciting maneuvers draw nothing more than a yawn. I am not pleased that this video is promoted as an airshow video, with no mention of Denver International Airport anywhere on the package. We have one of the world's best airshows here in Houston every year - so I know what I'm talking about. Don't bother with this video. The stars I gave it are primarily for the Red Arrows (England) and the Rocky Mountains in the background."
5,"Inova makes the brightest and best quality flash lights, these being one of them.",I bought 4 of these. Best key chain button cell flashlight you can buy. Has several modes of operation too like strobe and momentary.
2,Great product but store did not played fair,"I buy these flashlights because their capabilities despite of their size make them very useful and a lot of friends and coworkers buy them from me, however, I did not expect to receive many of them with very low to almost dead batteries, almost half the ones I ordered are in that condition, not gonna be able to sell them,,, lost some money!!"
4,A great little light,The title says it all.I took the clip off and put the light on my key chain just like a key.Recommended.
1,This is a piece of junk,"Myself, my cousin, and a friend own this brand of light, and all 3 of us have problems with this thing!!! The light starts turning itself on at the slightest jiggle, which is annoying. This problem can be fatal for a soldier! I wrote to the company telling of this problem and that I can't send this light to my military pen-pals in Iraq, and they said ""we are aware of this problem and are working to correct it"". This doesn't comfort me since I smashed the piece of junk 2 months ago. My Princton Tec light is smaller and without problems!"
3,It's bright until it runs low on battery,"When I first got this, It was very bright. I was surprised by how bright this little light can be. After about a week of use, the light got dimmer. Then after a month of use, the light still worked, but it got to the point that it wasn't really worth using. It's now somewhere in my closet."
2,Do not use as a keychain light,"This is an amazing little light when you first get it--small, with a keychain, extremely bright, and with four different modes--steady bright, steady dim, blinking, and lighting only when depressed. Then, after about a week, you start noticing that every time you take the light our of your pocket, the light is on. So you switch it to the ""on only while depressed mode,"" but the next time you take it out of your pocket, it is still on. By three weeks later, the batteries are mostly drained, with only enough remaining to offer just about as much light as your cell phone's LCD.Get this if you want to have a tiny backup flashlight in a drawer. DO NOT get it if you are going to be stuffing this in your pocket or purse or bag."
1,Junk. Burns through batteries.,"Due to some work I do at night in a warehouse I needed a small light that I could just attach to my keychain. I didn't need a full flashlight, just something that I could use for a few minutes a few times a week.I thought this light would be perfect. At first it was. Then the light got dimmer and dimmer. I noticed that the light was frequently turned on in my pocket - pant pocket, jacket, it didn't matter. I assume the same would happen in a woman's purse. This runs the battery down fast.Another reviewer pointed out that you can just replace the battery. You can - but it costs almost $5 which means you're basically buying a new flashlight each time. In my experience, the batteries (I've gone through two) last no longer than a month with only about 15 to 20 minutes of actual use. Total waste of money.Ditto the comments of the soldier reviewer. This is junk."
5,Über great light,"I have had this key chain light for a few years now, have never changed the battery and never had a problem with it. Its a very bright little light that comes in quite handy for everything from finding door locks in the dark to annoying your friends when you shine it in their eyes."
2,Bad Clip!!!,"I got this light as a gift just last week. I unwrapped it, put it on my key chain, and at the end of the day it was GONE. The clip must have come apart - so I didn't even get to use the light, just to try it out. Worthless clip - what a waste!!!"
4,Very happy,Gave it as a gift and they loved it. I provides more than expected light when looking for the right key at night time
3,Worth the cost,"I took the clip off of this and replaced it with a small split ring, and it hasn't left my keychain since. It is very bright for its size and the 3 output modes are a great feature. It doesn't throw light very far, but it is useful for most everyday, around-the-house-or-on-the-road tasks. They also make good gifts.**UPDATE**This thing burns through batteries."
4,Good Informative Overview of Hawaii.,"Good Informative Overview of Hawaii. Now that you know everything... what is it really feel like? Check out the video, ""Hawaiian Dreams,"" and see... You'll actually feel like you're laying back on these incredible beaches, virtually. You can't go wrong with either of these lovely videos."
4,Mismarketed,"This package is marketed as a new CD with a bonus DVD. The CD has 7 remixes of 5 songs, 4 of which are better on Matisyahu's previous CDs. And right in the middle is the horrible Swisha House destruction of ""Jerusalem"". In other words, this CD is a dud when compared to the earlier releases. The 4 stars are all for the DVD. It includes a complete live concert in Tel Aviv, plus interviews and casual scenes of Matisyahu with his band and wife and baby son in Jerusalem. The music is great and the rest gives us an opportunity to get to know him a little. There is also an artfully done music video of ""Jerusalem"" which is a good antidote for the pain inflicted by the Swisha House mix. This package should have been marketed as a great DVD with a free remix CD, or the DVD could have been sold by itself for the same price."
3,Good,"There were 7 songs on the CD and only 3 were by Matisyahu. Those three were really good, the other four were okay. Liked Live at Stubbs much better."
4,good but short,"the mixes are good and the songs are good as well, but the cd's short, I would've enjoyed a fuller ep or an lp length.I haven't checked out the dvd, as I'd rather check out the videos on youtube than watch a live show, but then I don't know exactly whats on the dvd..."
3,The scent is too strong,The texture of the product is very good and makes my skin feel very soft without feeling greasy.... but the fragrance is much too strong for my liking. I prefer a milder scent.
4,Classic Theessink,I am listening to this album as I write this review spookily enough. I must admit to being a fan of Hans and have been for some time now. This album is an earlier one of his and shows clearly where his musical tastes where moving to. I really love his use of the tuba or maybe it is a E# Bass but whatever it is it works beautifully with this music. The sound of strings with brass and Hans on guitar is simply stunning. In typical Hans Theessink form most of the tracks on this are penned by himself and if I were to declare a favourite track it would be Travelling Man or maybe Living in the Fast Lane or possibly Mississippi. Hell who am I kidding - they are all good.
2,Enegizer Silver oxide Blister Pack watch / Electronic battery pack of 5,Sufficent for if your watch will work but realize that is not realisitc to purchase this amount of batteries for your watch and having shipped by themselves. Better to buy in the store.
5,EXCELLENT!!,"Couldn't be any better!! Everyone who likes guitar ""picking"" should give this one a try. It's not really bluegrass, just toe-tapping relaxing. Takes you back to a much simpler time. As a native of Grayson County, VA, this makes me very proud of our Blue Ridge Mountain Music."
1,deceptive discount and photo,I wanted to purchase several ice cream scoops and noted that this item was originally $197.00 so assumed it included the dozen scoops as pictured. I received one scoop. Don't think the original price of one scoop was $197.00!!!! I am returning it and purchasing elsewhere.
5,So True!,"As the mother of a teenage son, this is so true to life. If I were a bit paranoid, I might think Jerry and Jim had bugged my home! And on the subject of authors, who the heck is PRUE Scott?While I laugh at Jeremy and his teenage angst (it's hilarious and I don't feel guilty like I do if similar situations with my son make me snicker) I'm sure my son recognizes me in Connie, the kill joy mom!Parenting a teen is tough. Zits finds the humor and anything that puts belly laughs in parenting, RULES!"
5,Borgman and Scott obviously remember being young,"Quite possibly the best book about being a teenager, what with the best friends, nervousness around girls, and wishing your parents didn't, well, exist. A great book!"
1,Footnotes don't work.,Footnotes don't work. Once you get past the first chapter the footnotes all point to the same footnote from chapter 1. One of the main reasons to get this book is for the footnotes.There is another electronic version of this book when you search on amazon. It's the deluxe bundle. That one works great.
5,Perfect Gift,My husband lost his Buck pocket knife after many years and this purchase was a gift to replace his lost one. He loves it and is more careful to check his pants' pockets for holes before dropping it in.
1,Knife is garbage,"The blades on this knife would not close without being manually pushed back into the body. None of the typical snap back like you typically find in slip joint knives. The plastic scales had a rivot that stuck out enough to catch your finger. Even though the knife is a US made knife the quality is way below that of the same model produce in the 1980s and 1990s. I have many knives and this rates as probably the poorest quality control I have seen in a knife allowed to leave the factory. I will continue purchasing knives through Amazon, but you can bet it will not be a Buck 300 series. Even the 500 series knives have gone down in quality. Additionally, I have sent Buck Knives two emails for other issues in the last few months and find that they do not respond."
5,Buck 309 folding pocket knife,I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality and finish of this pocket knife. I would buy it again if I needed another one. Makes a great gift for the man who carries a pocket knife.
5,Wow! Great Songs!,"I listen to some folk and listen to about any genre of music. I picked this up to see what it was about after seeing it was written by soldiers during the Vietnam War and was amazed by the disc. It spreads across humor to service rivalry to deeper reflections. I also like the reworking of some of songs such as King of the Trial and I've Been Everywhere.Personally I think it's a must have for history, Vietnam War buffs and those who appreciate folk music."
5,Great Classroom Aid,I was fortunate to take Dr. Fish's anthropology course were the tape was required for the class. I never thought I would use it again until I began teaching and searching for music from the Vietnam War. I used the tape to illustrate the hardships as well as the companionship the men found in Vietnam. I then complimented the lesson with Anti war protest songs to leave the students with a well rounded outlook at both sides of the Vietnam Era. I strongly recommend this tape/CD.
3,Not outstanding for a high school history class,"I bought this CD because I am a high school history teacher and thought it could spice up the week I spend on Vietnam. It is outstanding music, but I can't see how I'm going to integrate it into my curriculum. If that's your reason for buying it, I would recommend against it."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"This program advertises synchornization right on the cover but after an hour of trying and reading the limited directions i came across this little gem of information. This is a direct quote from the instructions.""FYI : : : : :There is no support for direct synchronization at this time. There is an ongoing effort to solve this problem and as soon as it is possible, it will be provided as a feature of PocketMoney.""Bottom line. If you need a completly stand alone financial program for your PDA it's ok. If you need something to transfer info back and forth to your desktop stay well clear of this product."
2,Unhappy,"First things first, my order took exactly 1 month to get to my door. But that may not be exactly 1 your companies fault. It may have been a shipping problem due to the weather or something. But my main concern occurred once I received the subwoofer, it was damaged. It had a strip of clear tape wrapped completely around it. Once I pulled the tape off, the terminal came off with it. Im sure it wasn't supposed to be that way!!!"
1,too much opinion,"Does a fair job on the basics, but too much east-coast liberal attitude. The bad cattle, bad dams, people building houses.Another case of lock up the west and keep it a playground for the coasts."
5,Marc Bolan the Warlock of Love fantasy poetry,"This poetry came out from London in Kingdom. 1969. writen by Marc Bolan when aTyrannosaurusRex, on the eve of T-REX.This is a book of Fantasy poetry , that mysteryous,darkgray clouds image in London,and fields in the darknights, like a metaphor.Rhythmical meter lyrics. its a my mind."
1,Ugly,I don't know what i was thinking when I ordered this. It is perhaps the most ugly thing I ever purchased but it cost so much to send back that I just kept it.
5,Beethoven & Mendelssohn violin Conc/Gardiner< Mullova,"So far, I have not received this CD. This CD is not yet delivered to me.David Chung"
3,"Smells great, leaves a thin layer on","Love the smell! Great for very dry skin. It leaves a layer of cream like thing on your face. But if your skin is any bit oily, or you want the crisp clean feeling, this won't give you. I have normal skin. So I use my other normal cleanser when I wear make up; only use this burt's bee cleanser when I wear absolutely no make up of any kins."
4,DVD add-ons a mixed bunch,"JMS's commentary is both humorous (expositions on table sizes follwed by apologies for being such a weenie) and enlightening (he finally settles the reason why Sheridan replaced Sinclair). As always, worth the price of admission.The commentary by Boxleitner, Christian, and Doyle is completely different. In some ways, it is more like a MST3K experience! However, it is not only very funny but very enlightening on what it was like to be on the set and part of the ""family."" Doyle's comment about breakfast after the makeup sessions, ""we were smelling eggs and bacon and [the Drazi actors] were smelling latex and glue"" really set out an image.<P...P>Video and audio quality are quite good. There are no real down sides to this set, just a few weak ones. Any B5 fan should have it."
5,DVD image quality is excellent,"As a counterpoint to the negative comments regarding the image quality, I found the image presentation to be quite engaging and remarkable, a stellar improvment over the aired 4:3 content. They had the foresight to film in 16:9, revealing details that I have never before noticed. No artificial edge enhancement was noticable.The CGI scenes are of considerably lower resolution, but this was a limitation of the technology of the time and foregivable.The scratches and splotches everyone has been complaining about comprise less than 5% of the total content. Grain is an inherent property of film and cannot be removed, so there is no point in lamenting over it.The CGI scenes notwithstanding, I was blown away by the crispness and saturation of color, and thoroughly enjoyed the presentation, as viewed on a very high performance 65"" HDTV display I might add."
3,Huge mistake in opening credits,"Spoilers...The opening credits for the first two episodes are supposed show Delenn in her orignal season 1 form. Not until after ""Revelations"" are they supposed to show her in her new form. However, the DVD credits for episodes 1 and 2 show the new and improved Delenn and spoil the surprise.It's just sad to know that whoever compiled this set really didn't know what they were doing and wasn't a true fan of the show. I'm amazed that JMS didn't notice this as well.It's bad enough the the box and DVD splash screen give away this plot point, but to have the wrong credits on the DVD is just sloppy. We're supposed to be getting the show as it aired and we are not.One of the reasons I bought the DVD sets is so I can show it to people who missed it the first time. Now they won't have the same viewing experience that I had."
2,Season Two Review,"I gave this season a low rating, not because of the show, which I give 5 stars, but the fact that the last two disks would not play in my DVD player! I had to play them on my Laptop and I still had issues! There must be something wrong with the DVD encoding on the last two disks."
3,The video quality....,"The 3 stars is NOT for the quality of the series, which is outstanding. It's for the quaity of the videos themselves. As with the first season it leaves a lot to be desired. The picture is fuzzy, there's quite a lot of graininess, and here and there you can see flaws in the film itself. When I first watched B5 on TV I remember thinking that the CGI sequences were quite awesome - in retrospect, these haven't stood the test of time that well, and it doesn't help that these CGI sequences are blurrier than the live-action sequences. Compare the video quality to the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine DVDs, which is quite excellent. I'm not sure if this is due to the quality of the original footage itself or a fault in the transfer to DVD, but in any case as a B5 fan it's a bit disappointing that the 'ultimate, archival' version of this series is of inadequate quality."
3,Mastered from bad prints`,"You've seen the series, you've read the editorial review.The series itself is great, the DVD collection leaves a bit to be desired.The prints that the DVDs were mastered from are grainy, scratched, and about the quality of a VHS tape.If you want a quailty picture, you'd be better off to record them off of cable on the next go-round. Burn a DVD from that.Final rating: Content=5 stars, Quality=2 stars."
3,"B5 Great, DVD Transfer Bad","I was very eager to get the latest season of Babylon 5 available on DVD. The 16x9 / Widescreen / Anamorphic DVD format is great. The problem is the image quality and transfer- it's not so great. Images are grainy, dark, soft focus, about VHS quality, not up to what is possible and I expect for DVD."
5,A Great Build up to Season 3 and 4,"As you probably know if you are looking at this product, it is very bad to watch the seasons out of order. The experience is so much better watching from season one to season five in order so you can experience the build up of drama, excitement and the clues that are foreshadow many events.The extras on the DVD set are also quite entertaining. Not to the level of the Lord of the Rings extra content (my gold standard) but better than many movies and TV shows.To sum up, buy it and you won't regret it."
4,"""We're not some Deep Space Franchise, we actually have a purpose!""","While I was not a fan of the first season, the second definitely changed my mind. The new Captain works perfectly, a bit kirk, a bit of picard. The multiple WWII references, and the development of an overall story ark. I will say, this season started slow, but about half way through, the episode where the Narn war is declared, sold me on the show. I don't want to write too many spoilers (as I'm still just getting into the show too). I will say it was worth getting into. If you can get past the very lame first season, there is much greatness to be seen, especialy toward the end. I can't wait to see where the show goes."
3,llove the season but cant see all of it,the babylon dvd i got was great but cd 5 needs to be reserves due to the srach in the cdit will not play at all at this timeother then that i love it ty
5,Babylon 5 - The Complete Second Season,I have always enjoyed watching this series and have been waiting for the chance to be able to watch anytime I want. I plan on buying the whole set eventually.
5,Fantastic,I had missed the second season of Babylon 5 -- I have watched all theepisodes I missed and was totally entertained and loved seeing whatI had missed -- time to order season three. Delivered in a timelymanner and in perfect condition.
4,"Really Good Sci-Fi, So Much Better Than The First Season! Recommended","Babylon 5 really hits it's stride in Season 2, with much better acting, great story lines, and seriously strong character development. The biggest improvement was in the casting change, replacing Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) with Captain John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) in the first episode of this season.I really like the way the way the show runs sub-plots through multiple episodes and, like real life, events in past episodes effect events in future episodes. We also see the groundwork being laid for the upcoming Shadow War and for several side plot lines.The special effects are still somewhat weak, but considering that this show was made in the '90s, they are passable.Recommended!"
3,Babylon 5 is great but where is the gag reel?,The description claimed a gag reel. A quick look on the discs did not turn it up. Doing a seach on the web I found a claim that the gag reel is actually hidden as an easter egg. I'm going to check it out tonight when I go home.The 3 stars is because they hid content in an easter egg. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.When are these dvd makers going to realize that serious home theatre owners don't want the special features hidden on the dvd.Once again proving that just because you can do a thing doesn't mean that you should do a thing.
2,"Make sure to buy the ""repackage"" version.",The packaging on this version is terrible. The plastic trays are ok but they are just glued to a carboard backer and fall out easily. I'm returning this to get the better one. I have the season 1 repackaged version and it is a normal multi-disk plastic clamshell like most recent disks.
4,B5 -- 2nd Seaon DVD,"Packaging was weak and had some plastic broken that holds the disks, otherwise DVD's worked fine, no issues. Show is great!"
4,Great Escape,It was fun to escape into the future with an exciting series. You get caught up in the intrigue of inter-alien squabbles versus day to day reality. You wish we were as advanced in space travel as the story line progresses. Viewing Babylon5 with popcorn in one hand and soda in the other was a treat to repeat.
5,Babylon 5 season 2,"Very much enjoyed this series while it was on TV, although I missed a number of the episodes. After purchasing season 1, it was logical to continue with the rest of the story. Season 2 is indeed better than I remembered. There was more character development and better interaction between the characters. I would recommend this series to anyone looking to replace regular boring television with an enjoyable, well written alternative."
3,Where is Commander Sinclair?,"It hurt to see the 'Scarecrow and Mrs King' dude replacing Commander Sinclair.They left season one with Sinclair being engaged to his love interest.Kosh telling Sinclair he's forgetting something. The something, Delenn had something she had to tell him. But, she went into the chrysalis to be transformed, before Sinclair arrived."
2,Great Episode but real Bad pixelation in speciic areas,"Babylon 5: Season 2 Episode 4 ""A Distant Star""Great Episode but it has real bad pixelation around 32:58 (minor one) and 33:50 (real bad for several seconds). I've downloaded it twice and the pixelation happens at the same spot. It seems that the fault is in the conversion of the episode."
5,Excited about reading!,I was very excited to find out about the Magic School Bus chapter books. I teach 2nd and 3rd grades and my students love this book! My 3rd graders are reading chapter books. This new series allows them to keep reading about Ms. Frizzle and her class. They are learning more Science facts and working on their reading skills. As a teacher I couldn't ask for more!
1,Disappointing,"Pentax AF540FGZ Flash for Pentax and Samsung Digital SLR Cameras (Includes Case)Out of the box, first use, it was stuck at 16mm zoom and cannot be adjusted, not even in manual, to different focal length. Called Pentax customer support, they could not help and suggested to send it back.Wanted to remove the batteries, but the cover is stuck half way over the first battery. No way to open it any further."
5,Works like a charm,"For an amateur like myself, this has been a blessing. Having never worked with an off camera flash or a camera mounted auxillary flash, the guide along with some online sources has really helped me to let this flash enlighten my gallery."
5,"Comprehensive, Step by Step Instructions","I found the author to be clear, and to the point. He gave step by step instructions, forms and analysis sheets to assist someone who wishes to go into this area. In addition he gave ""Hot Tips"" or ""Author's Notes"" throughout the book, giving information about a situation that he had encountered and how to handle it, or just useful information. Book is comprehensive, dealing with foreclosure flips, reos, buying at auction, buying before auction, how to talk to homeowners...MORE! Only one more thing to say: BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Not worth $30. for this book.,"He gives very, very general information in his book. It's a very small book with very little info."
5,Skeptic,"I was reluctant at first to start reading this book, when I did however I found it to be easy reading and interesting. I honestly wanted to keep reading.I like it first because it is in a plain simple language that any one can follow. It provides an easy to follow step by step process to make electronic records master. The book lays out the plan for the skeptics' who believe nothing can replace paper. I like the examples, the comparison of the dirt road crossings and the information highway. I love the summary tips at the end of each chapter, which of course I had to write down. By the time I finished reading Paper Trails I was excited about electronic records, erms, and ecm. Why? Because now I have a clearer understanding of what they are how they work."
4,Good Photoshop book,"Lots of color photos, lots of information and most of it is pretty useful. I leave it in the bathroom and read it when I have time and I still have not gotten through all of it after several months."
2,strickly for beginners,"Unless you are a beginner, this book is not worth buying. Most of the tutorials are just far too simple. And some of them you wonder why would anyone care. I currently have a subscribtion to the design graphics magazine on which this book is based. The tutorials in the magazine are just crap. Needless to say I do not buy the magazine for its tutorials."
1,Noisiest frig,"I bought this model for my remodeled kitchen. I would not recommend anybody to get this one. It's very noisy. I tried and tried to balance the frig as recommended to reduce the noise; but to no avail. If you sleep in a room next to your kitchen, you will hear it at night.No, don't buy this one."
2,This unit is too loud.,"OK, I must admit that it looks very nice and works wonderfully but my gosh it makes a constant loud humming sound. It's actually VERY annoying. I'm going to see if maybe I can have the fan replaced to tone down the noise. I can't say that I recommend it until the company does something to fix this problem."
3,Would not recommend,"The unit is, in fact, very noisy. If your cooler area has high end appliances this will certainly be the noisiest. Thankfully it does not run continuously. The door frame is plastic and relatively cheap. I would not reccomend this product in a high end home."
3,loud for such a small cooler,"I'd go for 3.5 stars but settle for three because although it seems to work fine it makes a highly audible cyclic humming/almost grinding noise during the cooling cycle. This is just too noticable to be located in the center of a house...my 20 yr old 48"" SubZero is MUCH quieter. Also there is a LOUD annoying beep sound when turning on the light or changing the temperature (why??). I think they should have invested a few more bucks into the motors for quieter operation given its cost."
1,No customer service,"Although this cooler seems to fit my requirement, I read the previous review about the noise. I decided to call Avanti and get more information. I was shuffled between sales and service and still put on hold with no answers. They lost the sale."
4,Almost gives you what you want.,"The story of Jim Pandrake ,who finds a strange engine ,with even stranger powers. That finding effects Jim's personal life ,changes the delicate ballance of super-powers in the world ,and confronts Jim with a group of immortals ,ruled by a 1,000,000 years old neanderthal.A returning flaw in the works of A.E.Van Vogt ,is the fact that the book is packed with excellent sci-fi ideas ,but none is fully developed ,a fact that creates in the reader a lack of satisfaction ,even if the plot ended satisfactorily. And it did. Not one of his best ,but certainly not one of his worst , ""Moonbeast"" ,a.k.a ""The Beast"" ,gives you a solid typical Van-Vogt mind-thrill."
3,Shorter than advertised,"The item is a reflective plastic strip and not easy to work with, sewing it on is difficult. Not suited for soft fabrics since it is stiff and will not handle a curve. The trim is however very reflective. My main complaint is that the piece I received was significantly under 10 feet and I may not have enough to finish the garment that I am trying to make reflective."
1,An appalling book,"The thesis of this book is that the South lost the War because of insufficient nationalism. To call this argument preposterous is to be kind. Out of a white population of nine million the South lost a quarter of a million dead and many times that number in wounded. The South kept fighting until every Southern city was controlled by the Union. A small agrarian nation, the South fought a large, industrialized nascent world power. Unbelievably the South came close to winning this unequal contest. To contend that the South failed because of lack of will is ahistoric and a contemptible insult to the brave rebels who fell under the stars and bars. A better judge of Southern will during that war was General Grant who, while attacking the Southern cause, admitted that never had men fought harder for a cause than the Southerners."
1,horrible...,"Every time I look at this book I cringe. These ""scholars"" simply ignore the battles themselves. The battles deteriorated southern will, not the other way around!! This book is horrible and I am cringing as I write."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"This book is a complete waste. The central thesis is ajoke. The South spilled a lot of blood trying to save theirnew nation and to say they lacked nationalism is bad. There wasproblems with State's Rights issues among the various Governorsof the States (esp. Georgia, N. Carolina) but among the soldiersit wasn't that bad.The author's continued comparison of the South'smilitary tactic's to those of German and French General'swho served under Napolean is just annoying since the bookswritten by these Generals were either not yet published inEnglish or published at all and I doubt that many confederatesspent much time reading them the works in French or German.This book is just another reason why many people thinkhistory is boring. If you want a good read, pick up a CivilWar book by James McPherson, Shelby Foote, Douglas SouthallFreeman, or Bruce Catton."
4,A Must Read for Serious Students of the Civil War,"Beringer, et. al. provide a remarkable synthesis of military, social and cultural factors contributing to Confederate defeat. While much of their material may seem dry to young readers, this work is solid history written by consumate professionals. Although I disagree with their central thesis that a lack of will brought about the South's defeat, I do believe this had a significant effect along with the other factors. Perhaps, Beringer's thesis was a product of the era in which he wrote--the Post-Vietnam Era."
1,Unreadable,"While I am sure Civil War history buffs who really enjoy detail may find this book interesting, I found it to be almost unreadable. It seemed to me that this was a PhD thesis that the authors felt had to be lengthy to get accepted. And after an enormous amount of redundant material, I felt like they didn't prove their views. If you want something readable, look to Battle Cry of Freedom by McPherson."
4,Someone who escaped a Cold Climate,"Nancy Mitford's childhood was well documented in the ""Pursuit of Love"". As the eldest of seven children she struggled to be noticed by her parents. She really came into her own when she ""came out"" - that famous English ritual of socialising upper class daughters. She had a talent for friendship and had scores of friends. Her marriage to Peter Rodd {Prod} foundered during the upheavals of the second world war, during which she found the love of her life - Gaston Palewski a member of the French government. Like Katharine Hepburn she never married the col. as she called him, as he felt it would ruin his career to marry a divorced woman.She moved to France to be near him and the French people she so adored. Like scheherazade she regaled him with tales of her numerous friends and of course her singular childhood. Hers was a fascinating life - take a look!"
4,Add to our collection,Kids love all the Scooby Doo videos. They ask for a new DVD each time they see a title they do not have.
1,Please stop trying to Buffy-ify Daphne!,"Why do they in the newer versions make Fred dumber (he was the SMARTEST in the original) and Daphne more Buffy-esque? It's just WRONG somehow and out of character to me. Other than that, the plot was bland and blah-- my kids, HUGE Scooby fans, were bored out of their skulls."
1,scratched,This movie was bought used and when we opened it we immediately knew it was badly scratched just by looking on the back of CD!!!! Never played
5,Gift for Children,"My children love Scooby-Doo, and really liked this movie. My kids are 3 and 5, and this movie kept them interested for the whole movie."
2,Really?,"I'm just gonna go straight to the point. Tabs (prints have no standard notations) have mistakes all over the place. 5 short solos written rhythmically all wrong and even have some wrong notes (where? For example: Solo#3, Bar 2, Beats 3&4, or Solo#4 first bar of the second line, Beat 4...).Also, the most important part: I have a filling that tabs for the final song were written by me when I was 10. First of all there is no BARS or Beats, not even a note values (you have to ques the chord changes....) Player does not follow the metronome and his tempo is all over the place. Which makes it even harder to get the idea of the melody or phrase. It has some good info (especially for the beginners) in it but you can not do the 50% good and other 50% whatever job and sell it as a PRO Video lessons.Please, do the pro job that people can use. Over all I would not recommend this DVD."
5,WONDERFUL AND VERY DELICIOUS,MATT GLASER HAS NEVER ENTERTAINED ME MORE THAN HE HAS NOW.I CANT BELIEVE MY EARS! THANKS MATT! A DEDICATED FAN
4,a good mix of Rock and Metal,"I was very pleased with this cd.. it had a good mix of rock,hard rock, metal and even a pop song... Dirk sounded good and the songs were very personal and well written..."
3,coverage of different communications technologies,"This book comes as a handy reference when you need to look up stuff quickly. For instance if you want to check out K1 K2 bytes in a SONET frame and what they do, you can easily find it in this book. In a similar way it covers a broad range of topics, such as ATM, Frame Relay, SONET/SDH, digital hierarchy, xDSL etc.Its not a definative guide since it does not cover any theoretical aspects of the technologies but still a good everyday reference with tons of pages."
5,A Must Read,"Clearly it is not possible for all religions to be ""true,"" because they all differ, some somewhat, and others dramatically, but all claiming some form of exclusive truth. True beleivers are often willing not only to die for their religious beliefs, but also all too willing to kill others who do not beleive as they do.We need to know more about religion, what it is, and how it works. Scott Atran tackles religion and religious belief from scientific and anthropological view points. His analyses of how religion works, what it does, and what it does not do, are thoughtful and comprehensive.In this day and age, when religion and religious beleif figure so prominently in human affairs, we need all of the help we can get in order to better understand religion and religious belief. This book does that."
3,Really for a narrow audience,"Why do people worship gods they can't see and believe the absurd (or counterintuitive as the author puts it)? In Gods We Trust is anthropologist Scott Atran's attempt to answer these questions. I wanted to give this book 5 stars, as he is a very intelligent man and profound thinker. I have heard many of his talks on YouTube and have learned a lot from them. But this book is written in a formal, academic manner--it's really is for someone with a fairly extensive background in this subject, not for the general audience. Atran might have been better served to popularize it more, like Neil Tyson, Lawrence Krauss, and the late Carl Sagan. In Gods We Trust would probably work much better as a textbook in a graduate class."
3,From the back of the book,"This is the 2nd of a set following Warrior Witch of Hel.""Bloodsong and Honor!They were the Death Riders, the remains of the once-proud heroes and Hel's greatest warriors. The very touch of their black-hilted swords or rotted flesh brought instant death and even the sight of their mail-clad corpses chilled the hearts of the bravest soldiers.Now, the warrior woman Bloodsong must face these ghoulish emissaries of Evil in a battle to the death, for the forces of Hel have kidnapped her daughter, and are determined to awaken the dark magic buried in her soul. From the mystical island of the Berserkers to wise Freya's domain, Bloodsong and her companions must prepare for the ultimate battle, honing their swords to lethal readiness, waiting for the onslaught to come."
3,A book for non-traditional familes,"However dated,this book does cover a few diverse and more common familial situations like single-parent, inter-racial, adopted family members, extended families, and grandparents as the custodial parents. However I was displeased with the the lack of discussion about children of divorce with half-siblings and step-parents, which was what I was looking for in particular. The book is well-written with elaborate illustrations, however dim the color pallette. The book as a whole is best suited for children over Four years."
4,A Daughter's Destiny,"Evan Somerset enters Brienne LeClerc's life offering money for an old vase. She won't sell it to him. Then two men come to her family's restaurant and beat her when she wouldn't give them the vase. She never would have realized it was worth anything to anyone but her mother... but someone is desperate to get it, and her along with it. Evan continues to hang around, but Brienne does not trust him. Brienne has difficulty with what Evan tells her about her past. He tells her that her grandmother and mother are not related to her at all, and that she is actually a duchess. But growing danger makes her consider that he may be right. Nothing is ever quite as it seems, and the biggest danger is yet to come.... This is a frying-pan-into-the-fire adventure. It was fun to watch the reckless heroine continually get rescued by Evan."
4,Great Service--Decent Product,"This download service is so useful when you need just a smidge of additonal research or are just beginning your investigation. This particular item is more a collection of scholarly articles and discussions that include most--but not all-- of the characters in R&J. For example, there is a discussion on the role of the Nurse which explains much of her dialogue/motives/actions and exposes her as one of the major characters deciding the fates of the main players. The priest also receives a similar treatment. However, if you are looking for info or thoughts on the guys (Mercutio, etc.) or even new thoughts on R&J themselves--don't look here. Altogether for ease and cost--couldn't do much better."
4,Totally fine,"This was obviously an expensive textbook for an upper level archaeology, art history or history class. It was in excellent condition and a fraction of the cost new."
1,"Interesting concept, but poorly executed.","Repetitive sentence structure, odd use of simile and a breathtakingly whiney main character tarnish the original concept of this book. If your looking for literature, go elsewhere. Harlequin Romance material."
3,Predictable but enjoyable.,"Anne Stuart's historical fiction is relatively predicable, they usually follow a similar line. Gorgeous, flawed and morally bankrupt hero meets up with naive, strong-willed and either plain or just passably pretty heroine who have a battle of wills about something or other that requires the hero to examine his heart and his motives in order to win the heroine or to save her from something.(Attention - the below may contain a possible spoiler)Lord of Danger was no exception, I loved the banter between the two main characters as well as the side story with her sister, Claire and the virtuous knight. I would have rather given it 3 1/2 stars but I can't give it four because the story ended so abruptly. Was Alys really going away, maybe forever, without telling her sister, I think not! Even if Claire and her not were newly wed and enjoying her wedding night with Thomas you don't go off without saying goodbye to your only sister and the last of your kin, not happening."
5,A very different medieval,"""A pox on your poor sister,"" says Simon, ""I've already chosen you."", and Alys faints at his feet. Already, on pg. 32, I was entranced by the words of Anne Stuart. Simon was in my house, and I was lost in his and Alys's story. He's the dark, tortured hero, but with touches of humor and humanity. She's meek and timid,or so she says. But Alys never hesitates to throw herself in harm's way to protect her sister; and eventually Simon. This is a medieval that has it all. Action, humor, sweet sensuality, and two romances. And the best thing about Anne's secondary romance, is that it never takes anything away from the main story; the romance and adventure of Alys and Simon of Navarre."
2,What a boring book!,"I had high hopes for this book. I saw it on someone's recommended list and then I saw the high reviews it had on Amazon, so I looked forward to reading it. However, like another reviewer who couldn't get into it, I couldn't either. It started out well enough, but it never took off. I didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. The plot got tedious. I was just bored. I literally had to force myself to keep reading and I was praying for the end of it.The premise is a good one, but it just wasn't properly executed. I love novels where the heroine is plain, but smart and fiesty and the hero is tortured and misunderstood. I love novels where people marry reluctantly but grow to love each other. This book had all that, but it just wasn't enough. For a romance novel, it wasn't very romantic and the love between the hero and heroine wasn't believable at all. Like I said, I really wanted to like this book, but I was very disappointed."
4,Just the right amount of everything . . .,"This thoroughly enjoyable book combines dark romance and timely lighthearted humor between characters. I picked it up based on the back cover and reviews I'd read, but still had my doubts about it. I didn't want just another romance where the hero falls madly in love with the heroine the first time he sees her. Well, that didn't happen, thank goodness, but I found myself utterly in love with Simon of Navarre. I'll be adding this title to my collection and looking up more Anne Stuart novels."
4,Great light,I bought this light about 2 years ago and I love it. It is great for lying in bed and reading. It doesn't disturb my husband at all. The only problem I have is that the clip is breaking at the point it connects to the battery compartment. I think it's because I take it on and off the book so much. But I love this light so much that I'm willing to buy another one and with the next one I won't take it off the book until I'm finished reading it.
2,"Looks good, functions bad","This is just bright enough to do the job, but it has a fundamental design flaw: to turn it off you have to close it, meaning you have to remove it from the book it's attached to. If you're using it as a bedside light this is a daily annoyance and enough to make me look for an alternative."
2,Fragile and dim,I am tried many nightlights and this one joins many others in the junk pile. It was fragile and broke easily. The design did not work for all books. And the light was just too dim.I now use a LED camping leadhamp and I believe this will stand the test of time.
2,Not about imaging at all.,"Despite the introduction saying that ""it is designed specifically for those involved in image processing system"", I failed to see how the book is supposed to achieve that. Most examples are not even about image processing. It is really a general, little-bit of everything software engineering book, including some distasteful engineer propaganda.So if you are looking about a book to help you design imaging systems, this book barely talk about it at all. If you are looking for a software engineering book, there are better ones out there.----The reviewer is a graduate student in the imaging field."
3,Pipe Heating Cable,"This heat tape worked well for 3-1/2 winter seasons. Apparently the ""test"" button which illuminates a pilot light indicates only that there is power to the heat tape, not that the tape is actually heating. My tape stopped heating and my water pipes froze even though the pilot light indicated that it was supposedly working. It is warranted for only 2 years."
4,Sharpshooters of the American Civil War 1861-1865,"Very nice pictures of uniforms and equipment for the Confederate and Union Armies. Nice detail and focus on accuracy of the accessories used by the soldiers. Rifles were pictured in a group with enlarged breech areas. All done in artists rendition. Few actual pictures of rifles, except with pictures of soldiers posing with rifles. Hard to see detail then.Pictures are old and grainy. And no close-ups of them. I suppose there are few rifles to use for pictures. I like the Green uniforms shown for Berdains Sharpshooters. Book presents brief overview of Sharpshooters from both sides. Nice quick summary book. Short but sweet! Thanks. Larry"
4,"Interesting story, average writing","Let's be honest, this is not the most well written book in the world. But that's part of the charm. This is a real story about real people who experienced what many of us dream about--the great adventure. If you like independent adventure traveling, order a copy. It will keep you entertained and spark that thought that you could do something like this too."
5,Inspiring in its simple humane account,"This is one of my favorite books. I plan on re-reading it many times in the future. Its inspiring in their simple, uneducated plan to see the world. They don't set unrealistic goals and aren't afraid to change the plan. Its not so much about the accomplishment as the experience. While I'm definitely going to be avoiding some places on account of their own experiences, I do plan on doing something similar, with a few of my own ideas for places to visit.Thank you both for living the life so many are afraid to even attempt, or unwilling to consider."
5,A very entertaining book,I did not want to put this book down. Great adventure book and made me laugh out loud. Read it; you'll like it.
5,Total inspiration!,"If you ever dreamed about doing something really adventurous at least once in your life, you must read this book! There's no sugarcoating here - Barbara writes about the worst as well as the best of times, and it left me feeling that I will have never really lived until I do something like this myself. I wonder what they were thinking as they first rode out of Los Angeles, having never attempted anything remotely similar to this, and without even having really trained for it! I loved the part where they excitedly tried to strike up a conversation with the american tourists from the tour bus. Hysterical! And what a contrast of experiences between Barbara and Larry, and the typical ""ugly americans"" on the typical vacation."
5,Miles From NoWhere by Barbara Savage,This book is really interesting. I learned things that I never had any idea about on the different parts of the world. The stories are told in a humorous way and I laughed alot and have told other people about the book and I am sure there will be alot of them buying it. To me it is amazing what they did by taking that trip in the 70's when the bikes were alot heavier and they didn't have the equipment available to them that we have now... they were seriously very brave and really in great shape to do what they did. I really enjoyed the book and hated for it to end.Miles from Nowhere: A Round the World Bicycle Adventure
4,"fantastic story, tragic end","i myself am not a bicyclist, however barb and larry transported me around the world with them, and i didn't want it to end.the part that brings a tear to my eye is that this woman took life by the horns. i was so sad by her tragic death even though she has been gone awhile. i felt i knew this couple personally.goes to show life is a gift, don't squander it.i wish i could get more info on her, i don't want to say goodbye. can anyone tell me what larry has been up to since?"
5,felt like i was there,"Undertaking a trip like this requires a great amount of temerity. What I especially like about this book is her attention to details that could easily have omitted or trivialized. If you've done any sort of tour like this, you can appreciate her annoyance at Chris ""The Sponge"" interrupting a romantic anniversary date or having a heated argument with her spouse during an especially excruciating ride across the midwest (howling headwinds all the way).She writes about her experiences of arriving in Egypt or cowering in a road side ""potty,"" sheltered from the rain, well enough to make you feel like you've been there. Even if you aren't able to take a trip like this, you can still experience it from the book."
4,Great book for anybody interested in cycling or travel,"Very well written book. Not your usual travelogue. This is a real story. Unfortunately the author was killed in a cycling accident shortly after the book went to press. She was a great writer who really covered the ""earthy"" parts of the trip"
3,very average,"Cycling 23,000 miles is a notable accomplishment, but that doesn't mean that one can write about it in an interesting way. Reading this book will tell you more than you want to know about the minor travails of the author and her husband; it will tell you very little about the world they cycled around"
3,a good read if using caution,"As an interpersonal and relational scholar in the field of communication, I viewed this book through the eyes of someone educated on the topic of relationships. Ellen T. Wachtel has many good points in this book, but I would stress that it is a book aimed at marriages and long term relationships. This is not something that young couples just starting out would find very helpful. Many of the tips in this book help to remind readers of the maintenance required everyday in their relationship. Overall, I would recommend this book for someone who does not have a lot of experience studying communication who is interested in preserving their marriage."
3,Poor typesetting and typographical errors detract from this book,"The content of this book so far is not bad. It contains good practical advice. However, the errors and wild fluctuations in the fonts used to print this book make me want to throw it away sometimes. It looks like someone cut and pasted dozens of emails from different sources that caused the font to change pitch from page to page, randomly change style and, sometimes, turn letters into special symbols. I'm tempted to return this book on that basis alone since it renders it quite frustrating to read!"
2,Starring Jacqueline Lovell???,"Where's Jacqueline? Of the four movies in this set Jacqueline Lovell, a.k.a. Sara St James, is in only one - ""The Erotic House of Wax"". She is nowhere to be found in the other three! ""The Erotic House of Wax"" is for the most your typical 'B' movie fare: College girl inherits financially decrepit house of wax from her weird grandfather. Girl and her friends, with unexpected help of a mute mystical woman with magical amulets possessing powers of lust brings 'erotic' wax figures to life. Well, you can probably figure out the rest. All said, ""The Erotic House of Wax"" is the only movie in this set worth having. The other three leave much to be desired - In fact, I wound up fast-forwarding through them!"
4,Highly recoment for anyone considering bankruptcy,This was a highly informative book and makes the reader feel better about the hard choice of bankrucy. offers good tips and advice on the legal aspect of bankruptcy as well as alternatives and rebuilding credit after bankrupcy.
5,"A ""Best"" Title Well Deserved","From straight forward food writing, to stories that food plays a award winning supporting role; this is a delightful collection of stories that will keep you engrossed from begininning to end. Some surprising, some informative, a few heartfelt, and some down right funny!"
5,Lita-It just feels right (a must for every wwf fan),Lita is the wwfs best diva. Shes got talent. This video is really great and should be bought by every Lita fan. I bought it today and i've already watched it 3 times. Its a must buy....
3,Not bad,"Not sure how my previous review was placed in here, considering I didn't write it. but anyway, now that I have the Lita tape, I can now comment on it. It's not bad. Lots of matches thrown in there, some good footage from the Diva shoots (although considering Lita even says that she knows the guys really want to know what's under those pants of hers, there aren't nearly enough shots of her behind), and the best part to me was the behind the scenes footage, where you can see the wrestlers as they are in life, and not just on the screen."
5,feels so right,I'm a HUGE Lita fan and this video makes me love her more ever time I watch it. You get to look into her life and that's such a great thing of a star to do. She's such a sweetheart and you wouldn't know it by how tough she is on TV. This is a great movie
1,Only two of the herbs grew.,Only two of seven of the seed packets worked. I have done this before and follow the directions. I don't know if they were too old but only the basil and parsley have sprouted.
2,Disappointment,"One of the other reviewers mentioned a few loose ends. Boy, talk about an understatement. What a disappointment. While the book had its moments, thre weren't nearly enough of them to justify a readers plodding through the 282 pages of dialogue and description to find out the extrememly mundane solution to the mystery, and then there are all those loose ends. Save your time and money."
4,Very handy if you use the command line,"This book comes in handy, especially if you can sorta recall the command you need but you need a little hint. If you're not used to using the online help, this is a great book."
4,"Spectacular Photos and Wild Surmise in ""Arrival of the Gods""","i first read Von Daniken in 1972 and becamse fascinated with the subject matter of E.T. visitations to the planet earth. in this 1999 opus, VonDaniken returns to the mysterious plains of Nazca where he first publicized the enigmatic ramps, runways, and animal facsimiles , all of which were carved into dry red rock and visible only from above in this truly God-forsaken arid landscape south of Lima Peru. Now, hanging out of the passenger side of a small aircraft he has taken spectacular photos , some of which boggle the mind, of geometric designs of kilometer size, in this vast lonely wasteland. There are 150 such photos liberally sprinkled throughout the text. If you can get beyond his sometimes arrogant treatment of dissenting opinion, the book is a ""must"" for those who believe , or even dispute, that planet earth was the subject of alien visitations for centuries.

5,Great parent-daughter (or -son) projects,"I originally purchased this book when my two youngest (now ages 34 & 35) were 7 and 8 years old. They each did a couple of projects, but the best one was a doll. My daughter named hers Hannah and my son named his George. Those dolls still exist, and so do the memories of them making them. This is a great project book for parents who want some old-fashioned values instilled in their children along with some good old fashioned skills such as sewing by hand. My two loved their dolls and respected them because of all the work that they knew went into making them. I purchased this copy of the book for my daughter, the then 7-year-old, who now has two girls of her own with whom she can make memories."
4,Thought provoking and many layered.,"Although it may be an obvious point, I haven't yet seen it mentioned in other reviews here. One of the many points Mishima seems to be making is the need of the ordinary people (the children) to worship heroes who pursue the ideal (the sailor's life at sea) over the mundane (the sailor's life on land). When the hero abandons his quest, he is set upon by the small men who feel their own dreams destroyed. Thus, the need of the masses to live vicariously creates heroes, but once the hero acknowledges the hopelessness of the dream, we are all diminished and react violently against him. All in all a good book. It will make you think. But, I found it a bit over the top in heavy-handed symbolism."
4,"Artful facade masks a deep, psychologically-enthralling tale","Mishima is as artful in his language as he is in the selection of pure imagery to tell this tale of nihilism at its exaggerated worst. The characters are memorable--Ryuji and Fusako are portraitured in fine detail. The boys are, if hard-swallowed in their precocity, at least full-fleshed in their savagery. Harkens to memories of William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"".The text stirs the imagination like an art gallery--the book is filled with sumptuous forms and patterns that betray an aesthetic eye for the picturesque.Yukio Mishima is a devastatingly brilliant writer of enormous ingenuity in his craft. Dark, savage, and psychologically-labyrinthine, Mishima's gift for probing deeply into underlying human desires is one of the best I've ever encountered."
4,ikiru,"happy endings are for fairy tales. this one is a stunner! terrifying! life doesn't always make sense. it's hard, but it's fair. what a chilling tale!"
3,"A troubling, but somehwat satisfying, work of art","*Sailor*, as tales go, is an interesting one; his psychological suggestions are even more so. What the novel has in interest, though, is overshadowed by Mishima's excess in fervor. There is, for example, a simile or metaphor in just about every paragraph, some of which are not convincing in the least. Oddly enough, the book's most troubling scenes are described in Mishima's least bombastic language. It's also intriguing in that it's difficult to tell whether Mishima actually disapproves of the violent actions in *Sailor* (especially when you take into account his personal history). All in all, the book is a mixed bag of overwrought writing and thought-provoking ideas."
4,"Current of love, with undercurrent of death...","This is my first book by Yukio Mishima, the famous Japanese writer who committed seppuku following a failed military takeover.In The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea, Mishima writes with exquisite feeling and love, while the story itself is surrounded by death. A sailor falls in love with a rich widow, but her troubled son has other plans.I was reminded of the ache and writing ofThe Wasp Factory, by Iain Banks. The characters are vivid and understandable, but they don't necessarily behave in ways you want them to behave.I look forward to reading more of Mishima's works."
2,"Not enough suspense!!! Beautiful eroticism, though.","Read it as you would an erotic novel. Not as a typical drama or the suspense thriller that Mishima was trying to make. The ending was not a surprise. The build-up to the suspense was not enough. It lacked on various situations in between. The psychological mumbo jumbo that's usually involved in this genre of literature was way too indirect. If you're going to commit the crime, put more thought and brawn into it. I guess Mishima may have done that to show how naive and arrogant the boys in the story really were. Still, it needed more substance."
3,"The language is excellent, but the logic is lacking","The book is wonderfully written, however the faulty logic Mishima gives to the boys cannot be written off as shallow due to childishness or immaturity. The book almost implies a struggle between the pursuit of existence through death and the acceptence of existence through a mundane life. The use of shock value as a means to cast a negative pre-conceived notion ,found within most readers, upon the boys is unstable and destoys any veiwpoint through which to judge, interpret, or simply observe the work."
3,Troubling,"I read this book in high school. The thing I remembered best from it was the gang's chilling assumption that if they killed a person before they turned 14, they would not suffer any legal consequences. Given the recent case in Chicago (of the 7 and 8 year olds who most likely killed an 11 year old and are apparently not going to suffer any consequences), I fear that in some respects this novel is coming true in America today. We may see a rise of young murderers who realize from this case with the kids that they can kill in cold blood and get away with it... That's all I wanted to say....."
5,I love this book!!,This book is a great book. It was sent to me in a timely fashion and they even communicated with me via e-mail to ensure that my product was shipped. I would definetely use them again!!
4,Scholarly and clear,"It's an academic, clearly written book about the sugar industry in the DR and it's central role in the relationship between the US and the DR. Thorough and easy to read. it might have included more breath, more context, more dimensions, but at the same time it is a fairly complete if narrow study, and what context it does provide is useful and well done. I found it a quick read, applicable to my interests and pretty well done."
4,I like it,"This spray is good, and I'm buying my second bottle of concentrate, but I'd probably just make my own (jojoba oil, tee tree oil, a little lavender) if the natural foods store were closer... we've had some diaper rash with it, using cloth pre-folds and mainly wool wraps, but nothing that doesn't clear up with a day's attention and application of Canus zinc cream.I love the way it smells and my babysitters adore it."
2,Strong smell!,"We had been using a lightly scented wipe solution when I decided to try this ""potion"". It is very strongly scented, which some parents enjoy because of the masking effect on the diaper pail stink. Unfortunately, it seemed to disrupt my daughter's normal skin chemistry and within one day of using it her bum started to stink! After a few days I stopped using it and her bottom stopped stinking. I wonder if the strong ""disinfectant"" strength essential oils are a bit much for use on skin. I would say if you want your diaper pail to smell better use something in the diaper pail, not on your baby's skin."
5,irish comic traditon,"this book is a reference for anybody carrying on reserches on Irish wit. Unfortunately, it has not so many references to Oscar Wilde, but it provides lots of useful information to carry the reserch further by your own means.It explores the ancient Irish way of telling stories, the Irish tradition of wordplay and it gives useful literary references.It is easy to read, and provides fundamental phrases to quote."
2,Well Written but not Factual,"First and foremost, history has to be accurate. Unfortunately for the late Mr. Tucker, his account of Chickamauga is far from accurate. The western theater's largest battle was a very complicated affair but one would not get that from Tucker's account. From his flawed view of the fatal order to many outright mistakes in units and responsibilities of the commanders, this story just doesn't stand up to years of historical research, mainly out of Leavenworth, Kansas, that have shattered most of the myths perpetuated by this monograph. Skip the superficial rehashes of Woodworth and get Glenn Robertson's monograph. For a deeper analysis, get Cozzen's study that is quite massive or wait for a new book on Chickamauga by a noted Civil War author that is in the works."
4,"Beautiful set, but with some flaws","I loved how this set looked online, and the price was irresistible. But when it actually arrived, it had some flaws. The colors weren't as vibrant as they look online, and there are places where you can see the yellow line wavering and bubbling up. And this was before washing. That said, it's lightweight, pretty much break-proof, dishwasher-safe and an excellent option if you have kids but don't want to give in to the tide of plastic dinnerware."
4,Better than Craigslist,"I hadn't decided on Corelle until I saw this pattern offered for sale on Craigslist - USED. It's perfect for my ""Fiesta"" themed patio/outdoor space. Amazon had it listed for $4 more than the used set, and free shipping. I would have spend more than $4 in gas to drive to buy the used set! Corelle is smaller than my stoneware so it fits my dishwasher better and suits a smaller portions diet. I might buy another set. The one thing I wish I new before purchasing is that the mugs are stoneware, made in China, although dishes say Made in USA. I'm concerned about toxics in Chinese products and haven't tested the mugs for lead yet. I'd have given the set a 5 star rating if I could vouch for the mugs. They match beautifully so I hope they pass the test."
3,pretty but not what I expected,These dishes arrived quickly but the quality of the dishes and the design was not what I expected. They were sent back at an additional charge. I would rather see the product and examine it before purchasing it.
1,Soooo Soooooo,"This video was alright, I don't really like A&E to boaring and drags out about useless facts. If you like John Gotti and mafia stuff you should get it, but be prepared it's not what you expect."
3,Courtnie,"This movie was okay. I cant really say I loved it though. John Gotti in some ways is a lot like the character that is played in the movie but on the other hand, they are some what different. I've done a lot of research on John Gotti and his family and I have to say, I did expect more from the film. It covers a lot of things a true Gotti fan already knows and could get boring at times."
2,Helpful in the area of American political thought...if you're in junior high,"I found this book to be very juvenile. It may help those who are in secondary education, but it is much too vague and adolescent for college. The subject matter is a BROAD overview. There aren't too many specifics."
5,THIS IS THE YEAR,My grandson wanted to learn to play poker. He already can play but he doesn't really know all the rules. He was very happy to get this set.
2,Not satisfactory,I expected a more through book on exercises and their effects on the body. Maybe a good book for beginners but not for experienced athletes.
2,This book is unsound.,"While the book features a variety of exercises, it advocates strength training methods that have been proven to be dangerous, and that by mere logic seem wrong. First, the author instructs you to hold you breath during each move, claiming this is proper breathing technique. Also, he condones explosive training which is detrimental to the muskuloskeletal system. Along with other flaws, this book was a waste of money. Your money is better spent buying books such as ""A Practical Approach to Strength Training."" This book is one that is backed up scientifically and teaches you the safest and most effective way to exercise."
5,Great book for learning correct form in resistance training,"I used to have a heck of a problem with squats. I was very afraid of doing them because I did not know how to do them correctly and I had no one to teach me. I bought this book and it has turned out to be a worthy investment as it has taught me how to do certain exercises (squats, deadlifts, lunges, etc.) with very good form. Thank you Mr. Yessis. The good thing about the book is that these exercises are described in great detail and with good pictures.For anyone who is interested in learning proper form, I recommend this book."
1,Incomplete,You could find the information in this book in any number of places online. Not only would the information at a good Kinesiology website be more complete but you would also get moving gifs to show you proper form.I don't think I got even one useful thing out of this book.
3,Heroes,"Linda Gordon did a wonderful job at showing the growth of social services over time, however the book lacked a sense of committment."
5,The Music of Silence,This book was a very insightful look at a very unique person. Mr. Bocelli writes honestly about his feelings about life and his music. I learned alot about him and his homeland. I really did enjoy reading it. I hope that in the future he will share more with his many fans. I consider it an honor to be one of them.
1,Bravado,"This book is the simplistic, self-promoting ramblings of a man/child who expects the world to give him a pass just because he's blind. iDefinitely on the skip list."
5,Touches your innermost heart,I Love Andrea Bocelli.His voice is so Beautiful.Anyone who feels like I do should read this book.It is absolutely Wonderful.It shows no matter what the obstacles are that you face that you can become what God desires you to be.
4,Very informative!!,"I wanted to know more about Andrea's background from birth, how he lost his sight and how his family supported him emotionally while he was growing up. God gave him a gift and he is now sharing it with the world."
5,Silence is Golden,"I thought this was a great insight to how Andrea Bocelli viewed himself growing up and how he felt. His hopes, dreams, losses, and everything else that goes into making a person what they are now. The trials and tribulations of an overnight star....and the sweet taste of triumph!"
5,A very wonderful book!,"I really enjoyed reading Andrea Bocelli's biography.I would highly recommend it to anyone, and would give it more stars if I could. It is very entertaining and inspiring!It has some great photos in it as well. Andrea Bocelli does a great job telling about his life and career."
3,Amanda 's Review!!!,"Eva is living in a time where her religion was not approved of in her country in Poland. She is a Jew. Her and her sister were eventually ripped away from their family and sent to a Nazi work camp where there is no pay and mindblowing hours. Her only purpose in life is to keep her frail, weak sister alive and to eventaully reunite with her loving family once again. Eva and her sister's job was to spin thread to make uniforms for the German Soldiers. The Jewish workers were treated extremely bad and worked til they couldnt work any longer. Nights were long and days were even longer, but for the Buchbinder girls, it was just closer days to being with family again."
5,Book Review on Torn Thread,"This review is on Torn Thread by Anne Isaacs. The story is during the Holocuast with a family tryng to survive. One day Eva, Rachel (her sister), and their dad are split up. Eva and Rachel are deported to a work camp in Parschnitz, Czechoslovakia. It's a test of survival for the girls as things happen to them.This is a touching story that symbolizes how two sisters don't give up on each other. Anne Isaacs did a good job of keeping the book interesting and kept me turning the pages.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in historical fiction and in the Holocaust."
5,a review about the book Torn Thread,"Torn Thread was a great book. It had so much details, I couldn'tput it down. It's about two sisters that get torn apart, then reunited. In the concentration camp they meet. When the Holocaust is over they stay at the camp, then find an apartment. They also find that their father has died. Evas hair also grows back when it gets caught inside the textile machine. She gets hospitalized for a few days. Then returns to the mill. They grow up and their daughter-in-law writes the book Torn Thread. That is my review of one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life."
4,A Refreshing View,"Having been intersted in the history of the holocaust for some time, it was an obvious choice for me to choose this novel. Far too often, modern people view the Holocaust through the common story. They believe that what happened was each Jew was sent off to a killing camp. It is often over looked that there were other fates for Jews. This is one of the few novels that explores the work camps created during World War II. It follows the story of Eva accurately because she accutally lived. This gives the book a strength that is almost uncommon today. However, it does have it's moments of weakness as do most novels. Hence, the four star rating. If there was an option it would be four and one half. This book should accompany those exploring death camps so that the reader can get a fuller view of a terrible time in history."
5,Gotta Love MP3 Downloads,Nothing makes something play in my computer better than downloading it directly to the drive.Classic track - excellent quality!
1,"Faulty Picture, Open and Damaged item.","First of all the picture is absolutely incorrect and misleading. I am so disappointed with Amazon for depicting different item (although I was certain that the picture posted does not belong to any M9 pistol, but yet trusted Amazon.) What you'll get is this:TSD Tactical/WE SDWEM9BRB Airsoft Full Metal M9 Gas Blowback(at least mine was.) But what I received was a heavily used (perhaps abused) pistol that Amazon labeled on the box ""ready to ship!!!!"". It is so disappointing that a company that is well known internationally plays such games with their customers!Avoid this one."
3,Rather dry fare in the scheme of things,"I would not say the connected essays in this volume 'unlock the English language'. But they do treat aspects of the English language that are worthy of treatment -- some more interestingly than others; on average, though, not all that interestingly. I have the deepest respect for Burchfield's lexicographic accomplishments. It is on account of that respect that I eagerly tore through his essays. The essays hint at what I imagine is a vast and deep knowledge, on the author's part, of the English language in its various guises across space and time. I'd love to learn more of what he knows -- I look forward, at the very least, to reading the prefatory materials in the OED. For all the author's obvious enthusiasm in his monumental task, though, the essays collected in UTEL are rather fusty, with only occasional flashes of eyebrow-raising insight. Overall, a bit of a yawner."
4,...,"not as cute as the little pad lock earrings sold by the same company.but they are just as you see in the picture.but you need them so you can have a key in one ear and lock in the other, and if you get the key earrings and the lock earrings, then you will have 2 sets of one lock and one key, so you have a gift for someone else."
3,"Decent Pliers, weak hinge","These pliers are adequate for most purposes, and relatively ergonomic feeling, but the hinge is somewhat weak and can make for an awkward grip. I would prefer something held together a little more solidly."
5,SMELLS YUMMY!,"Love this pineapple perfume oil! Because I'm allergic to most perfumes, I'm thrilled that I can use this sweet-smelling oil. My husband loves it when I wear it; and nuzzles my neck to get in a few more whiffs! Because his nickname for me is ""Sweetie Pie"", I plan on making this yummy fragrance my signature scent."
5,great value,"I paid half price for this perfume, which makes it a good bargain. Not sure about the quality since it's a present for someone."
5,Thank you for very quick delivery :-),I am really happy to have found this again. This has been my favourite eau de cologne over years. It's fresh and somehow special.
4,Family fun,"While this was a shot in the dark, it proved to be a good one. I read the reviews first which proved very helpful and so far watched 2 movies from the pack. I suspect I will get through them all this winter. The quality is as expected with the older ones..a tad grainy and fuzzy but that's what makes old movies fun. I get the feeling I am there in the time without all the high gloss of today's grand ""events"". For the great price I was able to buy several films I wanted in my collection plus at least 30 others I never herad of! If some are not stellar, so what? You can't go wrong with this collection if you see at least 2 movies you want in the pack."
2,"Lots of movies, only a few good ones",Unless you're really bored there's not many of these I'd really recommend. I'd say only about 10 movies are worth the time. But that is really a matter of taste and what you are comparing it to. They play well and are in good condition and cheap.
3,Good For Collectors,"This product was pretty good. I received it as a gift. The quality of movies and sound was average. The only really negative thing about this item was that the movies selection really wasn't the great. It was like they took every movies star, put all of the movie star's movies in the hat, and randomly picked them out. AKA: the movie selection s wern't the greatest, but overall it was good for what I see the price is."
2,A mixed menu of quality and show biz,"A Big Box for a small price. A few Five Star pix, many movies where the pix has a nix."
5,Family Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,This is a great collection for the price I paid for it. My son and I have enjoyed watching the movies.
3,Family Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,"This Films are not what I would describe or list amongst "" Classics "" but at the price provide you with some average to good films along with a lot of rubbish. At the end of the day there are a good number worth watching but only once, and at the low price still good value."
1,A poor use of my money.,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. In fact, I viewed three of them and the quality is so poor the rest will remain on the shelf unviewed. I have relied on internet sales for two years now, and this is the worst."
2,A waste of money,I was very disapointed in them there were very few big name stars in the group of movies I bought this set and the comedy and musicals box sets and wish I had not bought any of them. It is better to look for boxed set that feature your favorite stars.:(
5,Family Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,The item was exactly as discribed and arrived in good condition. I would gladly buy from this seller again...anytime!
2,Not too bad.However.....,"Well not to bad a deal.Most of the movies here aren't too bad(The Inspector General,A Farewell to Arms,A Star is Born etc;)and have basically clear picture and sound quality.It's true several of these are silent but even a few of those are good.There is a problem with this set however,after you've watched these movies once they will begin to wear out my mother and I discovered this when we wanted to watch ""The Flying Deuces"" for the second time the film was a lot more blurry and it was difficut to hear some of the dialogue.My advice is not buy this collection unless you find it for sale VERY cheap,and to just rent some of the better ones.We did get a few things out of this my mother said that she discovered Buster Keaton,W.C.Fields and Charlie Chaplin because of this for instance,(and after we liked Father's Litle Dividend we decided to watch Father of the Bride which was even better)so I have decided to give it an extra star just for that."
2,Family Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection,It came in good time. Much to my surprise I had purchased almost the same collection from Amazon several years ago. I gave this one to my son and family. I'm sure they will enjoy it as we did the first one.
3,Hearing-impaired?,"Several people have already asked my question, and nobody answers: are these movies subtitled for the hearing-impaired? I want to get this for my elderly mother, but she has to have subtitles. Given how cheap they are, I suppose they aren't."
3,Some lousy old movies,I guess I enjoyed about half of these old films. But I'm not a Three Stooges or Shirley Temple fan.
3,Japanese 30 days,"Pro: 1-Clear explanation of basic grammar. 2-Pronunciation speed slow enough to fit beginners.Con: 1-Recording sound quality: harsh. Berlitz says, on the cover page, that the original publication was from another company (Ch & Tsui). I am not sure that the recording was originally from cassette tapes (very noisy background) ??2- Binding: Same problems with other 30-days-series (I own French & Spanish 30 days) the binding was unsatisfactory. I can't open the book easily and the individual pages came off loose after few attempts.I am not sure if the speaker(s) is(are) native Japanese.3- Not enough Japanese characters."
3,good book with some reservations,"The textbook in the package is well written and covers a lot of territory. However the binding (at least in the copy I bought) is very tight; the book tries to snap shut. My hands begin to ache after trying to hold the book open for a few minutes. Also troubling is the high level of background noise on the audio CDs, like they were dubbed from very old cassettes. If you are serious about learning Japanese you might consider Genki 1 or some other college textbook with cassettes if you can afford it; Japanese in 30 Days might be an alternative if you are on a tight budget and have strong hands."
2,Poorly manufactured and poorly edited,"The book's approach towards teaching Japanese grammar and vocabulary seems decent, but the poor manufacturing and poor editing of the book make it hard to use. The binding disintegrates quickly, which makes it hard to use for learning-on-the-go. The book appears to be an abridged version of a longer text - and thus many of the practice questions and answers are out of sync and/or missing, due to sloppy cut-and-paste work. Even worse, there are outright mistakes in the text - for example, on p. 72, ""arimasu"" is asserted to be the verb for ""wash"" in a practice sentence (it's actually ""araimasu""; ""arimasu"" is a different verb which doesn't even make sense in context). Berlitz's lack of quality control is disappointing."
3,Berkitz Japanese in 30 days,"The CD is again scratched up; Is Amazon selling returned products. Buyerof this kind of product can make purchases and downloads the CD on to iphone and returns them. The CD ""cartboard"" holder is too tight to take out the CD."
3,japanese 30 days,"1-I like the book very much, being a beginner. Compared to other japanese instruction books, this one has a methodic approach to grammar and vocabulary. I give it 3 *, two minus * for the very bad and strange binding . Looks like all the 30-day series, Spanish, French...have the same problem of binding.2-The CDs were scratched all over, being in a bad and TIGHT cover. I would give 1*."
1,Disappointing,"I watched this movie because Hoyt Axton was in it, listed third in the beginning credits. He was on-screen for about 60 seconds and never performed, which was an unforgiveable lapse on the part of the movie makers - he was far superior to any of the performers in the film. As a movie, it lagged, contained shallow dialog, and had a weak and predictable plot. Some of the songs were good, but overall it was an extremely disappointing film."
5,Really Good-Buy at Walmart,This is not your average hot sauce. It is sooo good! It has a ton of garlic in it and it tastes good on almost everything. There's no need to order it and pay shipping. I get mine from Walmart.
5,best hot sauce ever,sriracha is the best hot sauce ever dont mind the anal fissures though. good work sriracha! i love you most
4,Hot Fong !,"I met Huy Fong Spiracha in Thailand where he works as a short order cook at the Thaksin Shinawatra restaurant. He introduced me to his Hot Chili Sauce. It's Hotter than Hot Hot Hot Hot but adds a nice taste to most rotten boiled eggs, cow brain, dead fish, or raw yak meat.Gives plenty of fire to dead squid too! Yum!"
2,An okay hot sauce,"For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I do not consider to be a favorite. Even though it is not terrible--I used two bottles of it--it is not something that I would use on a regular basis. As for the sauce's flavor, it is distinctive yet peculiar. It has a nice heat to it, also--not too mild and not too hot. I have used it on multiple kinds of food. I do not consider Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to be a preference, but I do admit that it stands out from the other hot sauces that I have used. Actually, I rate it 2.5 stars."
2,Realy hot sauce,"I put this on everything I eat, I use a 17 oz bottle about every 2 months, it is amazing on Ramen, Pizza, Burritos, chips, it has amazing flavor and just the right amount of burn."
3,Very good sauce...in it's proper place,"In it's class (asian), Sriracha is without equal. Most people not from Minnesota or Wisconsin should be able to eat this. But I must disagree with most reviewers and warn you...it is not a sauce for all purposes.If you're looking for a general-purpose pepper sauce, then be aware that peppers are the third child in this mix, behind eldest sibling - garlic, and middle child - sugar.Because of that, it will compete with the flavor of most foods, not compliment them. This sauce will not be a component of what you are eating, it will be THE flavor, dominating all else. That's OK for bland dishes, but a disaster for others that have already complex flavors.If you like the classic asian combination of initially sweet, then lingering heat, you cannot go wrong with Sriracha.If yer from Minnesota or Wisconsin, stay away from 'dis an' stick with dat super-spicy tomato ketchup, ya betcha!"
5,Just want one bottle and don't have time to head to china town,"Perfecto, reasonable price for one bottle (and prime!) and saved me a bundle of time: it is spicy so try it in a small amount before squirting more. Has a direct 'hot' flavor with little weird after taste. We add it to spice up a stir fry, in noodles, in ramen, hot dogs, dipping sauce... Anything! It is pretty good hotness."
4,The Ketchup of Hot Sauces,"The only reason for it not getting 5 stars is that, among my hot sauce collection, there's other sauces that go better with specific foods. I like Cholula and Garlic Tabasco are better on pizza. I favor Amazon(the hot sauce brand) Sriracha on chili, for a sweet/hot kick.There is no sauce more versatile than this one, though. You can safely put it on ANYTHING and it won't disappoint. The squeezable, perfectly-sized big bottle, with the green cap acting as a hose nozzle is the perfect vessel for a sauce with which you will be painting any edible thing you can find."
5,Good on almost everything,"I put this stuff on all kinds of food: noodles, potstickers, rice, soup, mexican food, asian food, anything grilled etc. The food that it probably complements best though is pizza. Probably the only thing it wouldn't be good on is sweet foods.As others have said, its not the spiciest sauce around, but it has far more flavor than most hot sauces. This stuff is so good that I take it to other people's houses when they have cookouts."
2,Not any full season,"It's not going to be a whole season or anything on DVD, it's just going to be a bunch of episodes.EDIT: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA"
5,AHHHHHH YEEEAAAHHH!!!,"Regular Show is up there with Adventure Time as one of the best Comedies on Cartoon Network right now. Glad its FINALLY getting A DVD release, I'll deffinantly be snatching this up DAY 1! And I suggest all my fellow Toonies do the same. Who cares if its not a whole season set, 1 episode of Regular show is better thne a whole season of some other shows...so really... your getting more then a fair deal, lol."
5,What can I say,"You can't beat Mortiki and Rigby. If you like action, adventure, romance, the supernatural,and all out insanity, then you will enjoy a quiet evening watching the Regular Show."
1,"Hm. Hm, hm.","A bunch of random episodes, send it to the moon.A DVD that's not the complete first season, send it to the moon."
1,More Stupid Marketing,"This is why the greatest tv accessory so far is the DVR, just release the damn season, if you want to sell more by way of marketing offer the same season over and over again with different art on the disc and booklet."
2,LOVE the show!! HATE the marketing!!,"I have run into too many dvd sets (that aren't an entire season, blu-rays w/ digital copies (that won't play on iTunes) & individual dvds (that the season gets released as an entire set) to be taken for a ride again. There is definitely a reason this is entitled a Slack Pack. They have slacked off again with putting a whole season on the dvd. All the episodes from Season 1 together are shorter than some movies! C'mon Man!I have all the episodes on iTunes & on my DVR but it would be nice to have a set that I could play in the kids car dvd player. Until they decide to release an entire season at once or the box set or whatever (just as long as it makes consumer sense & not screw consumer sense) I will make due with the episodes on my iPad.They better not release them on flixster or anything cloudy. I can manage my own cloud after i receive a physical copy"
4,"great show,but just release season 1","This is one of my favorite shows,and I thought it would be the first season.Well,I just looked up the episodes,and I guess I was wrong.It is ridiculous.I still don't see why they don't just release the first season.Still,it is pretty worth it for an awesome show."
3,False advertising,The screwdrivers I received were not the screwdrivers in the picture.I accepted some compensation for this matter but did not get the screwdriver I wanted.Overall not happy.
4,The Snitch,"A nice quick-and-easy escape. ""The Snitch"" flows very well and you get roped in to the characters immediately. I am originally from Dallas and it was nice to see a novel set in places I was familiar with or had actually been myself. The only problem I had with the book was some of the language, but it didn't hurt the plot. Keep writing good stuff in Dallas!"
1,terrible,"I don't know how he got it published. I bought it because it was set in Dallas, but it was a waste of time and money. Very poorly written. Sorry."
5,Wonderfully Calming Music,"This is simply heavenly, relaxing music which I use when I want to decompress or meditate or relax. It has a deep calming effect. Enjoy!"
3,The So So Singing Bowls,"I am a Buddhist and even have my own singing bowls. This rendition were more like wind chimes on a slightly windly day as far as equating it to the sound or lack of differentiating sounds with the bowls. Great for meditation, but will not work for healing or raising vibrations due to a lack of tones and vibrations."
3,Boring music.,"It only cost me $0.99, but I'll be frank: it is supremely boring. How can anyone give it five stars, it defies my logic. I will give it three stars at best. In fact, I am cutting off the music as I am writing this review. If getting bored and going to sleep is your desire, buy this by all means."
5,The past making sense of the present.,"If you are confused by events in Zimbabwe today, where the head of state can openly say for all the world to hear: ""the white man is our true enemy"", this is a MUST read. Isaac Benatar's description of life in a country that could have been the 'Jewel of Africa', presented entertainingly, helps to explain why Zimbabwe is fast becoming another African disaster."
5,"A beautiful ""Song of Africa""","I enjoyed this wonderful story about Ivan's eventful life and his experiences while living in Rhodesia, full of fun, adventure, romance and much more."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"First, of all let, me say that the, book is riddled, with inappropriate, punctuation. It seems as if the book has gone through many lives. There are sentences that are written in the third person. (This is a first person novel). There are sentences that are in past tense and present tense and first and third person in the same sentence. Every sentence ends in an explanation point! The few scenes of action are completely unbelievable and far fetched. The subject matter is what drew me to the book, and I read the whole thing because I am interested in it, but, and I feel I must say this, it is one of the worst written books I have ever read (in its entirety). I don't understand how this got past an editor or a proofreader, as it surely could have benefitted from one, and it might have been a much better book."
2,This author is confused,"I have a few problems with this book.Firstly, I struggled with the grammar and found it difficult to believe that the author ever proof read it. He is, after all, a lawyer .... clearly, legal writing is not his strong suit. The book is riddled with puntuation errors and incorrect capitalization.Secondly, the author could not decide whether to write an autobiography or a piece of fiction and finally produced a hybrid. The result is disapppointing and leaves the reader, familiar with the country and history, with more questions than answers.In some cases it is far-fetched. I cannot believe that Rhodesia's prosecutors ever took part in clandestine operations. I was there and, from my experience, they rarely left the cities.All in all, disappointing and I was left with a feeling of disatisfaction with the whole book. Sadly, what could have been an excellent autobiography or piece of fiction is neither."
5,Sturdy and Fashionable,I bought these as a gift for my son (one ear pierced so he always has a spare. They are very sturdy and a good size for a younger person possibly an adult as well.
5,Love these shoes,"I just received my shoes and I absolutely love them. Since I'm on my feet all day, I look for comfortable, supportive tennis shoes. These may be the most confortable shoes I have. I have not taken them off since I got them."
1,Low Spirites anything but Phantasticke,"With so many fine recordings of wind bands available on the market today, ""Spirites"" flies very low. The wind playing on most every track suffers from serious intonation problems that seem to sap what little musical interpretive interest Mayse is capable of displaying. Whitacre's ""October,"" which normally leaves one's spine tingling with bitter-sweet emotion, is presented by the RCC group as a flat-lined, ill-paced story that sadly misses the point of being melancholy in the October of one's life.This very young two-year community college group is simply not up to snuff with such ensembles as Eastman, University of Northern Texas, or the New England Conservatory, to name a few. From the first track, it becomes apparent that the ensemble lacks the command, presence and maturity necessary to pull off the pieces with any sense of artistry."
2,Board supports,Not a bad idea but not entirely necessary under any circumstances. Save your money and use a 4x4 or something similar.
4,all about soya beans,i have a research on all about soya beans.. can u help me solve my problem... i want to know all about soya beans and please include the layout of plantation or mill
3,Just okay,"The light works okay except for the following problems:1. The clip that comes with it will eventually pop loose and fall off of your keychain.2. If you change the mode to ""single click stay on"" like the manual says, it's easy to accidentally activate the light while it's in your pocket. I had this happen enough times that the battery died very quickly. And you walk around with light coming out of your pocket.3. The cover to access the battery can also come open all by itself."
1,Made in China????????,"I was excited when my new Buck Trapper arrived in the mail; however, the first thing I saw was Made in China. What a disappointment. Everyone knows that the best steel is made in America. I own many Buck knives and have always compared them to S&W; pistols the way the hinges fit together and open so smooth. This particular model was milled poorly on the back of the hinge and opens like a Case XX. If I had bought a Case XX at least it would have been made with American steel.Thumbs down to Buck for selling out."
1,Where did this guy come up with the Security Police stuff??,"Is this guy really in the Air Force, or is he just dressed up and standing by a stage prop on the back cover. I'm a Security Police with 5 years in and I've never read such a poor and unrealistic discription of what we do. 'Major' Stewart must really live in a fantasy world. Next time he should really do his homework. Also, when did the US start using Typhoon Submarine's. A Typhoon is a Russian submarine. The US doesn't have them in the inventory. Better luck next time."
1,"Is this book were an aircraft, it'd be The Hindenburg","Although interviews with the author are steeped in his back-patting flying a ""fighter bomber"" (huh?), he obviously flies better than he writes.There are currently 28 other reviews of this book. If you study them, the high ratings talking about how this author is the next Dale Brown, are heavily outweighed by the nearly negative-star ratings from people who have experience with the B-1 and they are quick to mention the inaccuracies, rediculous and\or extraneous plot twists, and overall crumbly storytelling.The B-1 has four massive afterburning engines -- the imagined thunder of which is drowned out by the loud sound produced because this book sucks so much.I agree with the latter raters. I wouldn't be interested in seeing this guy's other writing even if the books were edible and I was starving to death."
5,This was a cool book!,If u action fans think that Tom Clancy is dope...read this book. It is great and it kept me engrossed for hours!! Move over Tom Clancy because there's a new author who is going to be way more popular than u!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Very tired,"For a new author, this book reads very tired. The plot is far from original (see Dale Brown), the characters little more than sand-up cutouts (see Al Gore), and based on his descriptions I have to wonder if the only thing he flew was desks. His ""hero"" makes the near instantaneous jump from fighter jets to B-1 bombers without even blinking.This is really a shame since the basis was there for a good story about a location and problem that seems rarely touched (see also Larry Bond's Cauldron). I was really looking forward to this - but in the end it was one big mistake."
2,What happened to the war?,"This book had an interesting plot....but it was plagued by many grammatical and spelling errors. There were also other types of errors, such as saying that the U.S. has Typhoon-class subs, which are actually Russian SSBNs. Or the mispelling of 'Kadena' Air Base as 'Kadina' Air Base (I lived on Kadena). Another big thing....what happened to the war between Russia and Ukraine? Did it end after 'certain events at the end of the book' (don't want to give it away to those who haven't read it) or is it still going on? The B-1B is certainly a very capable weapons platform, but I believe you slightly over exaggerated it's capabilities, by stressing again and again how great the Bone is. But I guess that's because you're a Bone jock, ha ha."
1,Zero excitement and even less accuracy.,"If Mr. Stewart had tried, I believe the book could have been much more interesting and realistic. It is a great book if you know/care nothing about the military, it's assets, reading excitement, or intrigue. I was a B-1 Aircraft Commander and was looking forward to some interesting reading. Unfortunately, like a poor video-rental selection, I kept trying to trudge through the boredom, hoping it'd get better. The dog-eared 70-ish page is when I gave the hardcopy away...along with the warning about why I gave it away. Nothing like Flight of the Intruder, this book is not good."
5,"Action packed, a great story and an awesome ending!","I loved the book and couldn't put it down! Great job by Stewart. As a current Air Force Instructor Pilot with over 2,500 hours I can see the vivid realism and exciting details in the storyline (except for the F-16 intercept - but hey, there has to be a little bit of fantasy in everything). The other two books were awesome too (Kill Box and Third Consequence). I hope there are more to come. To the other reviewers of this book, you obviously haven't spent any time in a military jet and don't know what you are talking about. As for his writing style, it was perfectly in harmony with how pilots work, think and FLY! I also found it refreshing that there were some morals displayed by the hero and not the usual [physcial contact] on demand and bad language."
4,"good story with no sex or profanity, thank you Chris.","plausible concept, lots of action, descriptive scenes, I felt like I was actually there. ""edge-of-seat"" story."
2,Thin on Useability,"This book is very beginner oriented. All of the explanations target one basic function in Excel, but never are they all tied together in a more complex example. There were also several grammatical errors, which add to the amatuerish nature of the text.If you're looking to do very simple things with your Spreadsheets, then this will do the job, but otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,Not for beginners,"This book has an audience but I can't figure out who it may be. It certainly is not for beginners. It does a poor job of beginning with and building upon the basics... the KEY to learning and understanding any new language.I bought this book prior to buying several others on Excel programming, the glaring weaknesses in this book are exposed in a comparison to its brethren.Oh, and the pictures are too small.Skip this book, buy Albright's or Walkenbach's instead.JB"
2,It works!,"I am an experienced BASIC programmer. But I had never programmed, or even used Excel macros until I studied this book. I have now successfully programmed two Excel macros."
3,not for the thin skinned norcal new ager,"""Boonville"" is not a great book. not at all. However, It kept me interested for a week and it had it's moments, such as the softball game and a young woman's struggle with her unborn morality. But it was kinda hokey, too; Cliche depictions of feminists, locals and ignorant yuppies sipping pinot noir.that said, hippies, or people with new age tendancies, need not even crack open this book as Anderson has his fun with you guys....and he did make me laugh when doing so."
2,This is not the good side of Boonville that I knew!,"I lived in Boonville for several years as a newcomer, too, and I want readers to know that there are many wonderful people in the town and community. The crowd that the author or lead character runs with is pretty low and crude. Yes, that crowd is definitely in Anderson Valley, but there are many high-caliber folks there as well. Not all are low IQ bar fighters, either. Perhaps I should write a book about the many fascinating, higher life people who live there too. Readers should not be discouraged about visiting Boonville just because they read this book!"
2,"potential promise, ultimate disappointment","When the Washington Post's Jonathan Yardley dissolved into giggling enthusiasm, I should have known that Anderson's first novel was no equal to My Search for Warren G. Harding by John Plunket or Confederacy of Dunces by Robert Kennedy Toole. But I liked the cover blurbs, and the real Boonville casts a bizarre shadow, even for Northern California. Some parts of the story did keep their promise. A baseball game with in-fielders who could have wandered into the plot from a Bruce Willis movie. A Florida live-in girlfriend who takes up with a neighbor practically before our antihero can find a California pay phone. But most parts are forced. Our hero has ingested too much. The satirical targets don't matter, and the plot past the midpoint becomes a swim in molasses even after Anderson introduces a free sex commune. My advice: Re-read Plunket."
3,For Locals,"Well, I live here in Boonville-and let me tell you, it was written for locals. I actually think it's funny that anybody else likes it. Even though the names are changed, anybody from this town can pick out who is who in real life. It's cool to be on the ""inside"", (actually it's a bit depressing) but if you aren't from Boonville, you won't get the trip. It's cool if you like it and you aren't a local, but you'll probably get it better if you are. It's kind of like our town's ""inside joke""."
1,Ludicrous...and not in a good way,"""She had a distinctive 1940's quality to her, as if she were stopping off on her way home from the munitions factory, or if she held her hands behind her head, posing for a painting to be imprinted on the side of a bomber. She was why men fought wars. Her skin was creamy white, smelling of pine trees and doobage."" Oh dear. Yes, it would be hilarious satire; in fact, the whole book would be, down to the self-important author's bio. But alas, it's for real. Characters in this book actually say such things as :""I'm a feminist, but I can still have fun!"" and ""When in doubt, whip it out."" This book can only be the testament to the skill of Mr. Anderson's agent. Buyer beware."
5,Timeless Classic,"In a world that has become disconnected to the heart, this book truly speaks to just that, the heart and soul of the child who is fortunate to listen to the wonderful and magical places Sylvia's mother takes her to in every chapter of the book. Sylvia is the little girl who is the main character and who is unfolding into the wonderful age of 7. She experiences so many wholesome, down-to-earth, yet ethereal events that will speak to the child within yourself as well as to your own child. Each chapter has episodes that are weaved into meaningful stories. Our tattered copy of The 7 yr. old Wonder Book has been read so many times and also loaned to friends who need a heartfelt story for their child. The works of Isabel Wyatt are a wonderous rare find as she truly understands the consciousness and soul of children."
5,Brilliant,"One of the best children's books I have run across. The book explains the consequences and dangers of the shadow world and the rewarding richness of standing in the light. It is presented in a non religious, simple and magical way. Opening the doors of understanding for children and reminding adults at the same time."
3,Non-Christian Waldorf Families Beware,"I checked this book out from our local library, and loved the first half so much that I bought it before finishing it. To my chagrin, the second half of the book is nearly entirely about Christmas. There is even a moralistic story of Adam and Eve's fall from the garden, which I could not bring myself to read to my children. We are pagan homeschoolers, and we use a Waldorf curriculum because it is so easily altered to make it pagan (cycle of seasons, nature and art-based, etc). If your family is not Christian, you are better off looking somewhere else for nature-based fairy stories. I will be returning this book as soon as it arrives."
1,great design poor quality,"I'm an electrician, and the design of this pouch is great if you ask me, tools fit where they should, I don't have to look when reaching, etc, etc.......Problem is this is a sorry excuse for a klein product. I've owned two of these now, and the pockets keep ripping.......all of them. i'm not putting anything in there sharp like a drywall knife or such, just everyday tools like channel locks, side cutters, diaganoal cutters, screwdrivers, etc.Sooner or later, more likely sooner, you'll have tools poking out the bottom, if not, falling out alltogether. Until i see a new version with the proper padding for everyday use, i'm not buying anymore klein pouches or anything of the like. But if you can afford to buy a new tool pouch every 3-4 months, go right ahead and buy this product."
5,perfect,"this is a great pouch, better than new leather and fits almost any tool you dream of stuffing in it. excellent and well worth the money. product code ( o-n-a-2-0-2) talk to john, scott, mike, or spud if buying directly from the store in vegas... they are a little on the sweet side but spud is as helpful as they come."
5,"A powerful, heart warming book about Love","Henri Nouwen teaches from his personal experience. The lessons in this book go beyond head learning. Instead, the book explains how a broken, severely disabled young man can be an inspirational teacher to a Havard professor and theologian and to you and me. The book is written in easy conversational language and carries a very powerful, potentially life altering message about the Love of God made manifest through the broken body of the young man named Adam. A must read."
5,I love this book!,"As a parent of a child with disabilities, I felt Nouwen took huge chunks of our experience and condensed them into meaty paragraphs of great depth and meaning. He came to learn that his question should not be ""Lord, is there any way Adam can know you as I do"" but rather, ""Lord, is there anyway I can know you the way Adam does?"". So simple, but so profound. Nouwen sheds light on the God-given dignity in Adam's life and in so doing helps the reader understand God's great love for all of us. I have purchased several dozen copies of this book for friends and family."
5,Special perspective of a parent of a handicapped child,"I have bought copies of this book several times to give to people who are caring for my son or who are thinking about a career working with the severely disabled. Nouwen explains the blessings to be found in the joys and sorrows of life with those who are limited in how they relate to the world. This book reminds us that God's love is not based on our ""worth"" to other people or to society. Wish this were available in paperback like the related Road To Daybreak."
3,Led to Believe That It Woud Be a Great Read,"Adam could not speak, or even move without assistance. He suffered from frequent seizures and spent his life in obscurity. Despite being severely handicapped, Adam led Nouwen to a new understanding of God. Nouwen wrote over 40 books, and this was the last book by this popular and honored spiritual writer. I've also read Nouwen's Our Greatest Gift: A Meditation on Dying and Caring. Several years ago I was made aware of Henri Nouwen, a Roman Catholic priest and author, and his book Adam. Unfortunately Adam was an unfinished work when Nouwen passed away in 1996. The book is short and feels incomplete. I really wanted to like it, but I really believe Nouwen put Adam on a pedestal making him out to be something that he was not. Despite having some major theological differences with Nouwen, I have learned from the man."
2,bored to death,"Another low budget movie that does not deliver. Not a lot of nudity, with a title like this there should have been a lot more. The blood and gore is dim store stuff , the acting is as good as the script [that not saying a lot] and the sound quality is just bad . I think the cover does justice to the movie i.e. dull. Buy Gutterball instead or Amateur Porn Star Killer or A Fred Olen Ray [even his no budget movies are more fun than this].P.S. this is a comedy/horror which just adds to the lameness."
4,horror movies are better b-rated!!!!,please ignore the other review for the fact he must a lonley porn addicted freak with that being said if you like b- rate horror films then yes porn shoot massacre is for you right amount of gore and nudity for what you pay for only down fall shelly martinez has a small part which was the only downer but the parts she does have is great plot good production was decent ive seen worse trust me !!! this at least one to own if you just a horror movie fan of anykind just not like the yuppies who expect more from just a porn title horror film!!!!
4,A fresh look at strategy for the future,"Author and consultant Michel Robert has tested his process for strategy development over the course of two decades of business experience. His method involves taking advantage of the overall knowledge of your company's executives and involving them in developing strategy, turning them into stakeholders in the company's future. His book is both a guide to the process and a collection of case studies of companies that have used this approach, ranging from insurance providers to heavy equipment manufacturers and developers of advanced weapons systems. Not surprisingly, Robert champions his proprietary process and often crosses the line into selling rather than teaching. Nevertheless, we find that this can be a valuable handbook for the CEO who is considering how to set a strategic direction for growth."
4,Worth the money,Just used this to replace my broken OEM stereo in my 2001 IS300.Pros:- fits perfectly- finish matches spot on- works for single and double DIN stereos- comes with plenty of screwsCons:- flimsy compared to the metal braces that are OEM- CD pocket is kind of useless for would prefer a non-slip pad insert for cell phones and such
2,a disappointment!,"If you're looking for a great map of small sections of Norfolk and Virginia Beach, buy this. If you're looking for a map of Norfolk and Virginia Beach, don't! The map is described as Virginia Beach/Norfolk City Streets and Metro Roads. What it doesn't say anywhere is this: The maps cover downtown Norfolk and from from the end of I-564 on the west to I-64 as the east border of the map including most of the airport. North to south, it includes the Chesapeake Bay to south of the Elizabeth River. It also covers Virginia Beach east of US 13 (doesn't include it though) to the shore. North to south, it includes Cape Henry to Oceana Naval Air Station. It leaves out everything inbetween including most of Little Creek--almost six miles between the two maps. No good for those of us going to Little Creek which is part of Virginia Beach."
4,"Solid, in-depth profile of Michelangelo","Overall I found this biographical novel to be quite good. Stone presents a convincing profile of Michelangelo and his rather troubled and turbulent life in the context of the fascinating time in which he lived. It also provides some rather interesting insight into his family relationships as well as his dynamics with other important artists and figureheads of the time. Unfortunately, I found the numerous typographical errors in the book to be a bit distracting. At the very least, during the editing process, it should have been discovered that even Michelangelo's name is spelled incorrectly at least once! For further reading, I HIGHLY recommend Ross King's Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling."
5,A must read,I am seriously considering re-visiting Italy just to do a Michael Angelo tour. This is a beautiful and engaging historical story of God given talent and human endeavour. It puts his works in a completely new and much more appropriate light.
5,Brought the past to life,"Very readable and interesting (albeit very long) biography of Michelangelo. Stone brought to life Michelangelo's passions, genius and constant battles with the Roman emperors. I read this book before a trip to Italy and it certainly enhanced my time in Florence, where Michelangelo spent parts of his life."
5,One of my favorite books of all time.,"To see how one our earth's greatest artists had to struggle with ""clients"" such as the Pope is cathartic. Irving Stone is one of our best contemporary writers, in my opinion. His Lust for Life, another great artistic biography. Just so much timeless humanity on every page. I'm in awe of his research and distillation abilities. He brings history - and art and culture and politics and philosophy - TO LIFE! This should be required reading in schools. It's a great, great book. Shall be on my top ten, I think, for life."
5,Feels Like Being Right There,"Irving Stone makes you feel you are right there: in Ghirlandaio's studio, in Lorenzo's Garden, in the Pope's apartments, in Michelangelo's marble. I have seen the movie many years ago (and enjoyed it greatly) so when I saw the book in a friend's house borrowed it. When -after three years!- she really wanted it back, I could not help but buying it. You can read it over and over again, also as a text book of Italian Art, with an encyclopaedia at hand. Actually, that is the best way to fully enjoy this book: you travel to Florence, Rome, Bologna...at the feet of the masterpieces."
5,A Very Good Read,"If you are planning a trip to Italy, read this book before you go. Everything Michelangelo will mean so much more to you. A big, fat, thick book, but worth every minute of your time. One of those books that you tend to read more slowly near the end, because you don't want it to end."
1,THIS DID NOT EVEN DESEARVE 1 STAR,"OK, THE BOOK WAS REALLY BAD, I COULDNT UNDERSTAND A WORD OF IT AND I PERSONALY THOUGHT IRVING STONE COULD HAVE MADE THE BOOK BETTER. LIKE MORE INTRESTING. THE BOOK WAS VERY BORING. YOU WOULD THINK JUST BY JUDGING THE TILTE ALONE ""THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY"" THE BOOK WOULD BE INTRESTING.I MEAN THERE WERE A COUPLE OF GOOD PARTS TO THE BOOK BUT, ONLY LIKE 2 OR 3 OUT OF HOW MANY PAGES?656! THE ONLY REASON I EVEN READ THE BOOK WAS CAUSE I HAD TO FOR MY WORLD HISTORY CLASS. I HATED JUST BOUT EVERY SECOND I HAD TO READ IT. DEFENITLY NOT A BOOK I WILL EVER READ AGAIN."
5,"Astonishing man, great book!","Extraordinary language, fascinating story - one of the 10 best books I ever read!"
5,Definitely not a dull encyclopedia entry!,"The two previous reviewers (or one reviewer with two e-mail addresses) obviously read this as required reading--a good argument against required reading. For anyone who is interested in philosophy, aesthetics, history, and the socio-political turmoil of what may be the most fertile period of the western cultural tradition, this book is pure pleasure. Stone successfully dramatizes the struggles of Michelangelo and illuminates the tempestuous times in which he lived. The fact that the book is still enthralling (most of) its readers nearly thirty years after its original publication attests to the author's success."
3,770 page tiny fuzzy text makes reading unplesant,"I really want to read this book but spending a month reading tiny (6-7 point) lightly printed and fuzzy letters would be as pleasant as poking my eye with a sharp stick. I love a good book as much as the next person but this edition looks like it was put together by a blind robot. Shame on the publisher. Apoligies to the author, for having a good book plowed under by such bad craftmanship."
4,Mesmerizing slice of ancient Italy via keen observer,"Not being an art aficionado, I almost immediately passed over Mr. Stone's book when I first encountered it. What a mistake that would have been!Written in the form of a historical novel (like Michener), it is easy to get drawn into the life of one of the strongest cultural influences on not only Italy, but the modern world.The novel should be read for its insight into events and relationships between the major figures of the late 1400/early 1500s. It is this humanistic insight that makes the book.It should be noted that the inclusion of a pictorial insert could have been used to have added even more flavor, but Mr. Stone's descriptions will carve the sculptures and paintings into your mind's eye."
2,A Half-Step Above Johnny Tremain,"Do not mistake this book for quality adult fiction. It's a spoonful of sugar for non-readers who want to be well-rounded.If you're interested in learning about the past through the lens of fiction I strongly recommend Gore Vidal and Umberto Eco instead. Eco, an Italian, has a few books set in the same part of the word, though a couple hundred years earlier.This book is, of course, a way to learn about Michaelangelo, and a lot of the factual information is interesting and well-researched. But you can get that kind of an experience from an encyclopedia as well, without having to read Stone's repetitive and vanilla passages on what it means to have passion. Friends, It really is for kids."
2,stone lovers,i was required to read this book for school and i thought it was terrible. it is very repetitive and boring. I would only recommend this book to anyone who has no life or is in love with stone. Thank you for your time. good bye
4,Fantastic for history,"This book is a great source if you want to learn about Florence, Michelangelo, or sculpture. Stone has researched meticulously, and the details are stunning.However, if you are looking for a 'good book' to read, this is not the one. The prose gets repetitive and tired very quickly, the characters sometimes very one-dimensional.This aside, the book is a great history, if not a great work of art."
4,Extremely Passionate but Meandering,"This book was awesome, don't get me wrong, but the only things keeping me from absolutely loving it were the parts where Stone strayed from the most interesting areas (to me). The most interesting areas of this book were the inner workings of Michelangelo himself, the artist and the spurned son and lover and citizen of the magnificent Florence. I wish it had more of what went on inside his head instead of just colorful accounts of the wars of the Renaissance. I loved looking into his mind and his obsession with art.Being an aspiring art history buff, I was taking a sculpture class while reading this book, which is both a curse and a blessing, wanting to love it as much as he did but finding it difficult as a beginner.Another side I enjoyed was the love affair he had with the Medici family, most importantly Lorenzo and Contessina. Heartbreaking to say the least!"
5,A literary masterpiece,"First of all, this book was an excellent read. While living in Italy for a semester, I read this book several times, both before and after seeing the works of the genius. The book is very enticing and, I imagine, could be enjoyed by anyone, but I would say that it's indispensable for anyone studying the master's work or taking a trip to Italy (as no trip would be complete without seeing at least some of his works). It describes the great struggle of his life in gripping detail, and gives insight into most of his well-known pieces. Eloquent, compelling, and thoroughly entertaining, I highly recommend this book."
1,Sissy Survives!!!,keep me confused with all the plot meanderings and maybe I will think this is a phenom action/adventure genre... nice try!
4,I love the color of the green in this set.,"I ordered this set for our Rv and it was a perfect choice, the only thing I would change would be the size of the saucers and bowls, they are just too small even though we all are trying to cut back on our serving portions. :) The pattern is beutiful and I would purchase this set again."
5,"Relishing the ""Unreachable Star""","This riveting romp of a read is as deep as the reader is prepared to probe--a rollicking airport diversion, or an insightful examination of man's condition.For those who crave celebrities in unusal positions--naked Kirk Douglas raging at the staff of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (the stage version)for example,this will delight. For those who hunger for universal timeless truths, this will be a feast.For theater aficionados as well as for history buffs this is a must read."
3,"Okay, but not great!!","Perhaps I'm asking too much, but Hugh Holton is a much better writer than this book demonstrates. His earlier books were tight, works of art. Great police procedures. Lately, he seems to want to dabble in the mystical and otherworldly. For a writer of the quality of Hugh Holton who is a Chicago cop, there have got to be more interesting stories than this one to share with his readers."
3,Not for Primary Care people,"I ordered this book sight unseen. It was disappointing for a primary care person who needs a reference to common therapies for common conditions. A lack of diagrams and explanation of physical therapy modalities that would be useful to patients is unfortunate. It covers a lot of ground but in a very cursory way. The assessment and treatment sections are sizeable lists of test and maneuvers with with no explanation of what each one is. It may well be a fine resource for a physical therapist, but I wouldn't recommend it to a primary care provider. I ended up returning the copy I ordered."
5,A book that is as classy as the lady herself!!,"One of the best books I have ever read. A great love story for the romantic in all of us. It goes behind the scenes of hollywood, to reveal a relationship that started out on the sly; with a love that would last a lifetime. Very sad, yet a love we all wish we could find. I couldn't put it down. Bacall is a true heroine, a person easy to relate to. Her descriptions and writing flows nicely, and its like your chatting with a friend, rather then reading about a famous actress. It caught my attention right from the start, when hearing about her struggle to make it big!"
5,Lucky Author,"Andrew S. Targowski's bookThis book is talking about the future vision of the IT universe and the global citizens (both are my words). It is a cool strategic architecture that perhaps will convince Zuckerman and Dewey fellowship du tactical architecture to accept and welcome the WS, XML and Java OO 32 holy patterns architecture. I mean by lucky author that most of his vision is almost materalized. One more thing I wished he addressed how to Jack Welsh of the future will red of errors. Alan, the LDAP, Identity and Six Sigma automation Architect"
5,Love it.,I am a big fan of Buck knives and this one did not disappoint me either. greight product and as always very well built.
2,wrong picture,This is a drop point blade not a blade with a gut hook. The picture is wrong. I am returning item due to that issue. Thanks
1,Wrong picture again!,Picture and item description do not match! I'm not sure what knife you will receive if you order this.
5,Best part of my day,"I love this! I actually sit at work thinking, I cannot wait to get home and do some yoga, I feel so constricted. I have been doing this yoga for about 3-4 times a week for a little over a month. I am not pregnant yet, but I would not regret making this part of my routine, even if I never got pregnant."
5,Satisfy with the product,"I am very please with this DVD. The instruction is very clear and easy to follow. I thought this DVD is better than Yoga DVD from Dr. Randine Lewis. I just try this exercise for less than 1 month, so I dont' know how effective it is."
4,Good fertility yoga dvd,It's nice to have a different yoga routine for each phase of the cycle. I wish they explained what each or most of the exercises was helping but it is a good dvd.
5,"No Pressure, Just Pressure Points","This video sets the precedent for fertility yoga videos. Its super useful and well-guided and spares the hoakey factor of other videos in this genre. The other outstanding part about the content is that it is designed by Brandon Horn and Wendy Yu, two of the most knowledgeable Chinese medicine practitioners working in the specialty field of infertility. The postures are individualized based on the phase of your cycle which lends a supportive awareness and enhanced care to your pursuit of optimizing health and fertility, either on your own or in conjunction with any other treatments you might be pursuing. Its fun to learn some acupressure points too!"
2,I thought we have come to expect more,"If you like, the Bruce Willis type movie with preposterous and over the top events then you will like the book. If you prefer the more serious type thriller then you will be disappointed. I was disappointed.It should not be too much to ask for an author to do a little research to get some basic facts right. Like how the Secret Service really works. If he purposely writes incorrect facts then he must be writing for teenagers. Either way the book was not for me."
4,Great Horvath story,Another fine job by Brad Thor. Fast paced and a well laid out story. Love Horvath sarcasm and general attitude
5,One of his best,This was one of the few books I could not put down. The book drew the reader in and unlike most other thrillers there was never a slow spot! Brad this was your best. So good I read it a second time.
4,Love the concept,"However, find chapters choppy and with too much attention payed to bring new readers up to date on character bios. Dedicating numerous pages in each book finds me scanning ahead in order to skip what has been covered in previous novels (sometimes several) in the series. In my opinion, give a very, very brief synapsis and require first time readers to put in the time and money I have in order to get to know these characters. This author is top notch and, other that devoting too much of my time and money to update first time readers in details I have already paid for and 'earned', weaves a compelling and patriotic story that leaves me eagerly anticipating the next release. Albeit not as bad as W.E.B. Griffith, still very annoying."
3,Ubermonkey Gives Thumbs Up,"THE GOOD: Brad Thor's writing style is ok at best. He does a pretty good job of telling the story and doesn't innundate with pages and pages of descriptions that aren't needed. He writes good action sequences and the plotline was pretty solid.THE BAD: The main character's interaction with other agents was kind of retarded. I know that Thor is trying to bill Harvath as a cool and witty guy, but at times his ""humor"" fell flat and his jokes missed the mark. Which leads me into ...THE UGLY: Harvath's humor...urgh!! This was frustrating as he seemed to know everything except when to keep his mouth shut. I understand he is nearly superhuman, but it would have been nice to see him fail at anything so that we could all be reminded of his humanity. And, stop with the jokes...they aren't funny.Ubermonkey says that in spite of Harvath's juvenile behavior, this is still an ok read."
3,Path of the Assassin,Typical Scot Harvath adventure. Entertaining and fast paced. An easy read for those who like fiction that moves and is predictable.
5,get them Scot,Has the feel of the other Brad Thor books. Scot is the main guy fighting the world of terrorism. Good page turner!
5,Path of the Assassin,I do not wish to write a review is like an opinion and everyone has one. I like the book because I like that kind of book. Everybody should be their own judge what I may like you may not. I don't want someone to blame me because I said a book was and the go out and buy and get mad at me for wasting their money.
2,Definitely Mediocre at best,"If you like WWF you'll love this book!! The main character Scott Harvath is so arrogant, over the top and annoying by mid way through the book I was hoping he'd get killed!!! To me this book is like reading a LONG comic book or watching a cartoon. I couldn't recommend it to anyone, read a Dan Silva, Alex Bereson, John Grisham, or Harlan Coben; those are enjoyable talented writers. Brad here just got drunk and started typing!! Save your time and money and get something else!"
4,Non stop jet set action!,"Thor delivers again! What an adventure! I liked ""Path"" better than ""Lions!"" and I'm really looking forward to reading State of the Union! Scot Harvath=one bad dude!!"
2,DISAPPOINTING!,Perhaps my expectations were too high. The book made no sense. Too few believable passages. CIA and FBI characters acted like twelve year old boys in summer camp. Stealing air conditioners and short-sheeting each other.
1,Neither credible nor interesting,"I chose this book, based on a friend's recommendation, as a follow-on to Vince Flynn's series; but I found it to be a much less credible plot and the writing much less interesting."
2,Sophomoric at best.,"Scot's attempts at humor were so painful and the plot was so plain and predictable that I had to grab my copy of the Lions of Lucerne to make sure Thor really wrote that.He must have been under-pressure to write his second book. The problem with that is, readers like me will absolutely not invest future money/time the next time he and his publishers have a new release. I somewhat felt embarrassed reading this book.I will read the 3rd Thor book (I bought it at the same time I bought his 2nd book.. right after reading his 1st book) and I hope the author returns to form (I highly doubt it.)This book makes the (early) Vince Flynn books seem like bonafide classics... not an easy thing to do."
1,I should have paid attention to the 1 star reviews,"thankfully, I got the book cheap because otherwise I would be furious. I'm already upset that I wasted some of my life trying to read this book. Finally, after 200 pages, I had to stop. The dialogue is juvenile.Harvath is the only one who can do things correctly; he's the only one among trained agents who can think; he's the only one who can shoot straight (oh, except for the convenient beautiful woman who just happens to take on armed terrorists). Please, don't make the mistake I made: pay attention to those 1 star reviews. Save your money for something that is worth it."
3,Disappointed,"My daughter and I were disappointed in this second book. We loved the first one. This became me,me,me-- I can't explain the differnce. We are obviously in the minority so far. I hope that the third book is better."
4,Currently Reading,First time I have read this author. I like the book and storyline but would certainly prefer the language used was toned down. Tired of reading books with unnecessary language in them.
1,Tripe,"I can't believe this book made it out of a publishing house. I was in dire need of a quick airplane read, but this is truly disappointing nonsense. Full of cliche statements--""mark my words"", ""That's all well and good"", ""She was thrown in at the deep end and proved she could swim"".There are only two women in the book and both are ""the most beautiful women he had ever seen"". Thor egomanially has his own website. If you find your way to it make sure to check out Thor photographed with his toy guns and a cool helicopter. Ego far exceeds talent with this terrible read..."
2,"Lame writing, totally ripping off Vince Flynn","The writing is absolutely terrible. The dialogue is fit for a children's novel. I found myself almost ashamed to be reading something so juvenile. However, the story was pretty good and that is the ONLY thing that kept me going. My biggest disapointment is that his characters are a complete copy of the Vince Flynn characters. Scot Harvath is a very annoying and juvenile version of Flynn's Mitch Rapp character. So much so that even his love interest is a physically violated, daughter of an ex-cop, beautiful woman from Chicago. Come on! This is a total rip off on Ana Riley in the Flynn novels.Even the character's professional progression follows the Flynn story line. The main difference, of course, is that Vince Flynn can actually write believeable, semi-mature dialogue. If you want a thriller of this genre then get a Vince Flynn novel. Only pick one of Thor's books if you are REALLY bored and have LOTS of discretionary time."
5,Path of the assassin - great read,A lot of fun. Very entertaining. Picks up nicely where Lions ended. Same hero new bad guy and new love interest.
2,A Slight Misfire,"My favorite scene in all the Harvath books is in ""Path of the Assassin."" It involves a beautifully written chase through Chicago that was one of the most exciting things in the series. Like ""Lions of Lucerne,"" I felt let down by the ending as the way the identity of the assassin was discovered came across as downright ludicrous. It is still written in the breakneck style that is Thor's trademark and if there's only one book that isn't excellent, that's still a good record."
1,Lousy writing...,"Horrible book. Unreadable. Bunch of poorly-written macho BS. The Lions of Lucerne was okay, but this follow up is literally unreadable. Should have saved my money."
1,Trash,I cannot believe I got past page 10 without just tossing it in the dumpster.I don't think I've ever read a worse ending.Very disappointing.
1,Horrifying!,"By horrifying, I mean that it is a horrifying experience to read this complete piece of junk! The male, egomaniacal, wisecracking prose (which it barely is)reads like an incredibly terrible Hollywood movie. If I didn't borrow it from someone, I would definitely through it away.Now, I admit I don't normally read this kind of thing, but I have and I have enjoyed it. The only joy I could possibly get out of this would be if the main character, Scot Horvath, was on the receiving end of one of the many missiles launched in the first 50 pages.I can't believe this was even published. Whoever did so should be fired."
3,School of hard knocks,"The intent is certainly noble and of utmost importance but I believe the author should have focused on memoirs from a few rather than short reminisces from hundreds. This type of format leads to muddle and retention loss.Several recollections from the individuals themselves were absorbing and the reader gains insight on how tough-going it was riding the rails as a teen during the Depression. Stories of hunger, ever-present dangers on and off the rails, job searching, life in hobo ""jungles"", railroad ""bulls"", injustices and civility, etc. were fascinating reads.A sensitive study of human nature when times were wretched."
2,Hello from the world,"While the plight of the rail-line adventurers is certainly compelling, the way the book is laid out on the whole leaves much to be desired. I would much rather there been a focus on a few of the characters and their experiences in their entirety.The practice of submitting dozens of snippets from dozens of people makes for dull reading and dilutes the overall power of the experiences shared by these people. After reading scores of two-paragraph statements on the great depression, we are left with no feeling for the characters other than, ""Boy the depression must have really sucked!""I'm unsure as to whether this work falls into the ""publish or perish"" school of literature but it certainly seems that way. Too often the reader is left ""wondering"" and wanting to know more about some compelling characters.Alert publishers everywhere - A collection of short essays does not a book make!"
1,Crapped-Out at Just Over a Year!,Worked great for a year and crapped-out on the 13 month. I can not recommend. Even turned it off when not in use. Not sure where it went wrong.
2,Bad instructions,"This is my first time to back-up the contents in my Notebook PC. I might have been the stupidest customer that Lacie's ever had; however, the manual should have included step-by-step instructions to download the back-up software to start with.The manual indicates that the back-up will start after the USB cable is connected to the PC and the switch is turned on, and it was not true. This software had to be installed to the PC before the back-up takes place.Sounds basic and silly. But the manual did not point it out.After spending over an hour, I finally figured out what should have been done: installing the back-up software. What a waste of time!.Additionally, the serial number sticker was not found on the portable hard drive. It was on the box that I almost tossed before registering the product.I think that Lacie is not a customer-friendly and customer-service-oriented company at all."
2,Why so many good reviews???,"Its a hard drive that stores information and looks cool too BUT what I havnt seen people comment about is how hot this drive gets. As we know, heat is electronic's death. There is no fan, the casing gets HOT (not warm) to the touch. I was very suprised to see this coming from LaCie. I would NOT recommend this drive because of the over heating issue. These days theres no reason to have a hard drive with that much space heating up as it does. its detremental to the life span of the drive and the data thats on it, theres no reason to get a drive that will compromise the integrity of your data like that. I would NOT trust any valuable information being stored and used on this drive for more then a temporary solution."
5,Works like a charm!,Glad I went with LaCie and not others. A few extra dollars was worth it. Works like a charm!
1,LaCie Lives Down to its Bad Reviews,"Music and videos exceeded my internal hard drive back-up, so this was my firstpurchase of an external.After reading Amazon.com reviews of their choices, all external hard drives had a good percentage of unhappy customers. The LaCie especially was panned - but I liked its capacity/cost and hoped that the reviews represented a sampling error (and I would get lucky).The LaCie 300703U arrived and I plugged it in to begin the back up. After ten minutes it froze - so I started over. It was slow - very slow. Then it stopped again and failed. I took it to another computer and it did nothing other than waste electricity.So this will join the other bad reviews of a non-performing hard drive.Amazon.com refunds took back the item and refunded the money. I bought a Western Digital that works great."
4,Good Hard Great Price,"I bought this hard drive because Lacie has been reliable. I've had this one a few weeks with no major problems and it's easy to install.Some minor comments. First, I wish the supplied Firewire cable were longer. The short length limits where you can place the drive. Second, I wish the drive powered down when the computer is shutdown. It doesn't that I have seen, so it needs to be manually powered down. Finally, I miss the having the USB option. My mac had a firewire port bug, which may have been caused by the drive. Until, I restored the firewire port on the computer the drive was basically useless."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS POS DRIVE!,"I have had it replaced after 3 months - the second unit ( a new unit in a new box) failed as well. Do not buy this. I'm asking LaCie for my money back. I've had three other external hard drives hooked up (all no LaCie and they work flawlessly, so it's not my Mac. Avoid this POS, period."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE,"I had the same problem as electronic fan, after a month this drive refused to transfer data. when i try to copy a file the computer would freeze up. now i'm out $250. i will never buy la cie again. how could they sell stuff like this."
5,"reliable, quiet, great looking firewire drive",I've owned several external drives over the years and this is by far the quietest and best looking of them all. Remember the Syquest drives? Noisy. I use this drive to back up my iMac and Powerbook with a little OSX app called SuperDuper. Works beautifully and it's very fast. I have it partitioned into 2 logical drives. This is the first LaCie drive I've owned and so far it's been trouble free after 3 months. I certainly recommend the Porsche drives. I have the 250 gb Firewire version.
2,"One drive is great, one is dead","Well, I was pretty excited to get this drive at this price...so excited I bought two. I'm a video editor and was using it for storing media for Final Cut Pro editing. One drive lasted only 2 weeks...worked perfectly, then just wouldn't mount one day, and never again. Naturally I was on a deadline on a huge project and this wreaked havoc. The other one is still working fine, but I'm a little nervous about trusting it now. I wouldn't buy this drive again."
2,need to fry an egg?,"turn on drive, crack egg, empty contents onto drive (pinch of salt & pepper). serves 1. there is a reason most external drives are bigger or have fans - - it gets too hot otherwise. and firewire is going the way of the dinosaur. there are much better solutions out there. i've had this drive for about a year, and am going to remove it from the case and re-house it."
1,Is it possible to give this NO STARS?,"Do not - repeat - DO NOT waste your money on a LaCie drive! I have been through TOO MANY too many times, and lost EVERYTHING each and every time.I've had small drives, I've had large drives. I've had used drives, I've had new drives. If it says LACIE, run, don't walk, get away and put your money back in your wallet!They all work great - for the first month or so. Then, when you are relying on it and really need it and are depending upon your much needed and sacred files being there - POOF! - suddenly no matter what you do your PC will no longer recognize this device and all will be lost. I have tried connecting to other PCs, I have tried everything short of putting a bullet through it to put it out of my misery.And forget calling their techs for any kind of help. They obviously know what a P.O.S. this thing really is."
1,Lost All of My Data -Porsche should stick to designing cars.,"Well, I read the warnings about this drive and it's tendency to fail, but I had a lacie d2 that worked just fine so I figured I'd give it a try. Now I wish I hadn't purchased this product. I had it for just under a year and used it to store projects that I spent hours working on, editing video and sound composition. One day I plugged in the harddrive and nothing. Everything gone."
1,beware if you care about your data,"I have been a loyal LaCie user for years, and have paid the price - literally. No more.LaCie external hard drives will outlive their warranty. But so far, about a year after the warranty expired, two drives have crashed, i.e., they became unreadable, inaccessable, so that they did not even connect to my Mac via Firewire. As a result, I had to spend $1500 each time to have another company retrieve the data.These drives sat still, on a shelf, for two years, so there was no issue with them being mishandled or jostled. The internal mechanics simply stopped working.I am now looking for a new company. Never again will I purchase anything from LaCie. If you care about your data, stay away."
4,Due South - Season 2 DVD,My family and I loved this 2nd series as well as the 1st one.It's so much fun and always gives us a good laugh.Not only that at times it can be sad and you really 'feel' for the characters. There's usually plenty of action too.This is a very cleverly written series.I wish there were more like it!!
3,"Not bad. Not great, but not bad","It's so great to finally have this on DVD that I don't want to complain...but.... No widescreen, no CC, no scene selection, and the quality is about what you'd expect from a VHS tape. I hear the Canadian version is better, but I can't afford that kind of money. Really, you do get your money's worth out of this set. For this price, I wasn't expecting a miracle, just _due South_ in a watchable format, which is what I got."
1,yeah. right.,"good show. have to admit that. but am getting sick of having to return the dvd's cause they always come with the second disc broken!! I'm very unhappy with this product. I only hope that the ppl who make it heed our words. I really want this season, but thanks to the discs always coming damaged, I've never had a chance to even view it. in other words, thanks for nada."
2,Mediocre,"But for the quality of the content, I would not purchase this item again. Had I the money, I would opt for the good DVD's, not this compilation of trascribed media."
2,Cheap Copy,"The company that put this copy of Due South out did it very cheaply. There are no episode selection icons, to pick which episode that you wanted to watch. There are no opening titles listed before each individual show, to say what episode it is, that you are going to watch. It looks like a copy, of a copy, of a copy. The full series set has a far better quality, with episode icons, opening titles, and has four scene selections, to each episode, so I recommend that version, not this one."
5,Superb! The best biographical piece on Byron,"A Nottinghampshire native, who spent more than fifteen years studying the Lovelace papers Elwin had access to them as none other. The Murray archive was also his playground as Byron's publisher was also Elwin's own. Elwin provides information unavailable elsewhere. Unlike most other Byron biographers, his thought is lucid and leaves no logical gaps.This Elwin book and Lord Byron's Wife are a must-read for anyone with even a remote interest in Byron. Modern ""biographers"" totally lack Elwin's sophistication and depth of knowledge."
3,Hard to follow-up Subterranea,"My first IQ album was the incredible ""Subterranea,"" so perhaps its hard to imagine any other IQ album could match that high standard. ""Seventh House"" is just ""okay."" Didn't bowl me over like Subterranea. Two fabulous tunes (the title track, and Guiding Light) and four average tunes. While their music isn't overly challenging or complex like other prog bands, they have a very appealing sound and a smart use of drama and contrast. Since I like their sound, I will continue to explore their other albums and hope for more greatness."
4,"It isn't their best, but who cares?","This may not be Subterranea, or Ever, but it sure shines as an individual album. Each and every song on here is worth listening to and some may send chills down your spine from coolness (Wrong side of wierd). Overall, this gets a 4/5 stars..."
4,I am pleased with the product,"I bought the humidifier about 3 weeks ago. So far it works well. On the low mist option, a full tank lasts for about 7-8 hours which is a full night sleep. So the only drawback of it is that you need to refill the tank before and after you go to bed. Other than that all is fine. I am very pleased. :)"
3,"Small and good mist, loud fan to me","I find the fan to be too loud for me on this unit. It isn't roaring or anything but it's louder than my ceiling fan by a lot. It is noticeable when I walk in the room. These are inexpensive and work fine. For my money the ""Crane 2.3 Gallon COOL Mist humidifier"" also sold for Amazon is a better value. It is infinitely more quiet and holds about twice as much water and seems to be able to put out more water on high and unlike this Kaz which has only two settings for water out put (Medium and High) the Crane is adjustable from almost zero to something higher than high on the Kaz. That said the Crane is a bit bigger costs about 15 bucks more, and if you don't like the teardrop shape then this may be a better choice."
5,KAZ Personalmist Humidifier has helped me through the past few winters!,"The Kaz Personalmist Humidifier has helped my asthma and sinus disease throughout the past three winters. Small, easy to refill and you can have one in each room. The only problem seems to be the motors...they don't last that long. However, I can't live without mine while the heat is on in the house."
2,This is a MINI-humidifier,"Maybe it's my own fault, but I didn't get that from the product description. It's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips; in my apartment it barely lasts through one night. It's also really noisy. I am probably comparing to my last (normal sized) humidifier ( a vicks something or other, no longer available) which was great and lasted 3 years, until hard water built up too much limescale... I would have cleaned more if I'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it!"
3,Misleading picture,"I bought this humidifier looking at the displayed image on [...]. As compared to this image, the humidifier i received is really small. THe second image is the right image of this humidifier. Yes, its really personal. But the output of the mist is quiet high. Its pretty quite. Best part is, you don't have to change filters. Overall its not bad for that price."
4,Good for its size,"I first came across this when I requested a humidifier for my hotel room. I liked it well enough to order one. It is ultrasonic so there is the ""white dust"" issue. You need to place it on the end of a table so the vapor has a chance to disipate, If you set it on the floor the carpet gets wet. All in all a good product."
4,Considering........?!?!?!?,"This machine is very small/light; that, together with it's excellent performance, is its virtue. It is easy to carry about, to fill at an ordinary sink, and to place in the immediate vicinity of the persons/furniture needing a reasonable humidity level. It has two rates of operation which provide a wide range & are quite adequate to put plenty of water into the air quickly or to extend the life of the cycle at lesser rates. Advisory lights & the highly desirable auto-shutoff are well designed. The actual rates of dissemination (in cc's/hour) are not spelled out as they should be for this and any other humidifiers, but informally I'd judge this unit to be reasonably powerful considering - (thought I'd never get around to it, didn't you?)- it's modest and convenient size."
3,"A bit small, but runs SILENTLY","When KAZ says ""personal"", they mean 'tiny'.It does a good job, but leaves a white powder on TV screens."
2,LOUD noise when starting up,"I can't tell you if this actually adds to the humidity. It does put out a little steam-like cloud of moisture but more importantly it puts out a pretty loud grinding noise when we first turn it on. Sounds like the fan isn't seated well in there and is wobbling against the casing or something. The noise usually stops after 5 minutes or so, but it shouldn't be there at all. Agreed? Also, make sure you click on ""See All My Reviews"" for people who leave glowingly positive reviews on here. If that's the only review they've ever left on Amazon, they're probably shills for the company making the thing."
1,Piece of trash!!,"In 6months of me owning this product, it broke!!!!! I only used it twice when my infant son was sick. Eitheir way I called the company, the lady spoke to me like I was stupid, and on top of that they want me to pay for it to get ship back so they can replace it..Now for the kicker their not making these models any more...I WONDER WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Unit is a bit too small,"This unit performs as advertised but, it is not big enough to do a whole room. The picture reminded me of a unit I had bought previously and used for 2 years very satisfactorily... so, I was surprised and disappointed when this one was about 1/3 the size of its predessor. I did keep this and use it sometimes on my desk. If you are only a couple of feet away from it, it is o.k.; but, if you get up, forget it. You would have to use it in a closet to do a ""room"". lol It's about as big as a kleenex box. The tag says dry eye relief, well, one eye at a time perhaps!"
3,"Works well, not everything as advertised","While the unit has worked well, the filters advertised as being for this unit are NOT actually for this unit, so don't add them! Also this unit says it lasts up to 12 hours with out re-filling the tank, this is not actually true. The max I have had one full tank of water last between 9 and 10 hours and runs dry."
4,so far so good,I have owned this humidifier for a few weeks now and it does what it says and still works well. No complaints yet.
2,Too much maintenance involved....,"It puts out a cloud of water vapor and it's not all that noisy but I had no idea I'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart, wiping it down, trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down, refilling the tank twice a day, and wondering why this humidifier doesn't have an automatic shuftoff in case I forget to turn it off. At least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find. However, this is too much like an unwanted hobby so I'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room."
5,Quiet and works great,"Length:: 0:04 MinsI go to school in a Very dry part of the country. I have tried many different types of humidifiers and most make WAY too much noise. Many involve boiling the water and are too noisy to have in my room, especially when sleeping. This little thing makes very little noise yet pumps out a lot of cool mist into the air. The only down side is that this guy is small and does not hold a lot of water, but enough for me (especially to run while I sleep. Also with a small footprint it doesn't take up too much space on my counter like other models. Most importantly this machine does for about $25, what other machines do for near $100 at BB&B.; Highly recommended. :D"
3,Personal Sized Humidifier,"Like the cool mist. Holds enough water to last over-night. Mist doesn't really reach very far (i.e., both sides of bed). Also ends up getting the whole area wet."
1,Disappointed!!!!,"We returned this item twice.First the unit did not work. The second time, it did not generate any mist. We were pleased about how Amazon timely credited out account, however."
2,Moves water from the inside the tank to everything around it...,"Maybe we received a dud, but no matter where I put this humidifier, the mist falls and settles onto everything around it. The surfaces get damp, and in some cases downright soaking (wood, carpet, counter tops). This could be perceived as ""leaking"", but I was never able to see that the unit was actually dripping water out. I followed the cleaning instructions, but it just never seemed to work like I expected."
1,"Tried, does not work","I've had the bigger model of this ultrasonic for over a year, and we're very happy with that.I've run the product for a few nights. There is a lot of mist, however, the blower does not send mist up high enough to allow it to circulate the room. Next to my son's mattress, which sits on the floor, it gets the bed wet. I don't want to ruin furniture by trying to put it on the dresser in hopes the mist would circulate and evaporate.I can only imagine this product being good for traveling, when you might not care about ruining the hotel night stand."
4,Nice little unit,"I bought this humidifier for my wife who suffers with dry eye syndrom. She keeps it on at night next to her bed and has found it useful. We wanted a unit that was quiet and did not heat up the room, so picked the ultrasonic humidifier over the mechanical or hot steam types. This machine is compact enough for travel and easily runs all night on one tank of water. It is very quiet and starts producing a cool mist immediately when turned on."
1,Returned after less than 1 week,"I was very disappointed by this product. So much so that I returned it after less than 1 week. In my eyes, this isn't a humidifier at all. It shoots water up in the air which proceeds to fall on the ground. In my case, the water landed on hardwood floors and my bed. I've used a few humidifiers before, and they functioned properly without soaking everything in their vicinities."
2,"""Product Features"" should indicate size!","Thank goodness for the customer feedback. I almost bought this--until I realized from reading comments that it must be much smaller than it appears. Why isn't the water capacity (or any indication of size) listed in the ""Product Features""?I have had a Kaz Ultrasonic nearly like it for almost 5 years, but it easily gets me through 2 to 3 nights on one fill. I would highly recommend that model, which I'm trying to replace now because it's getting so old (but still works fine). But since the photo of this one looks so much like mine, not giving the capacity seems misleading and unfair to those who order it."
5,off beat and wonderful,"Simple, acoustic music and vocals with thoughtful and often hilarious observations of the world around them. I love the clarity of their voices and the funny sometimes goofy stories told. Difficult to find in music stores (look in the throw out/close out bin)."
3,Decent fun for an afternoon or two,"No, it's not the next ""Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight In Heaven"", but ""Burglar in the Rye"" is worth a couple days' reading. This book has gotten a lot poor ratings, and the only reason I can think that they gave him 1s and 2s is that they were expecting more. Why? This is Lawrence Block, not J.D. Salinger.Anyway, the much-maligned dialogue is a staple of Block; either you love it or hate it. The Bernie Rhodenbarr series is intended to be light-hearted, so don't expect major issues to be confronted. Block likes to end the novels in this series with a Nero Wolfe-style group interrogation, and this one is no different. Again, it's fun if you're not expecting high literary merit.If you're looking for something a little more hard-boiled, I highly recommend Block's Matt Scudder series, which read so differently that you'd swear another author wrote them."
5,Adrienne's Review,"Upon reading Lawrence Block's latest Bernie Rhodenbarr installment, ""The Burglar In The Rye"", I was once again entrigued by Block's mastery of the genre. I found myself unable to put the book down and finished it within 3 days. His use of strong character contrast and suspenseful plot lead to an electrifying mix of fiction writing that I'd strongly recommend to anyone."
3,"A Nice Read, but not his best Burglar","While Lawrence Block's Burglar series is a bit formulaic (some of the scenes are virtual repeats, at times), his characters are simply a riot. The plot is probably not the best part of these books--the characters and dialog are. So, if you are looking for a hard boiled or serious mystery, read Block's Scudder series or an Agatha Christie. While there is fun in this book and a great quote for my collection: ""Do you prefer women? To almost anything"" on page 54), this is not, IMHO, his best Burglar/Rhodenbarr book. Try ""The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams"" or a few others. Still, I'd recommend reading them all as light entertainment, similar to Block's Tanner series."
2,I just don't get it,"Although I liked the author's descriptions of the fictional NYC Paddington Hotel and the surroudning area, I just couldn't get into this book....The parallels between Salinger and Fairborn were just too contrived. The plot was way too convoluted for my tastes, and, like other reviewers here, I thought the author worked too hard to make the dialogue ""cute.""This is the first Bernie Rhodenbarr Mystery I've read. I will give the others a shot, simply because I miss having a rogue now that Lawrence Sanders is gone.This one just didn't do it for me."
3,"lots of fun, weak plot","Lawrence Block serves up another fast-'n'-fun but poorly plotted caper. The dialogue is dead on, the writing is, as always, smooth and pitch perfect, and as always, it's obvious that Mr. Bock made the plot up as he went along, and painted himself into a corner. The wrap-up leaves you feeling cheated, but if you're a Block fan, it's worth picking up this book just to hang with Bernie, Carolyn, and company."
2,Earth to Lawrence....please come up with a better ending.,"You cheated, Larry! Per usual, the dialogue is sparkling, the characters amusing, but the ending is ridiculous. This wasn't even out of left field...this was from an entirely different ballpark! I'm willing to give Block the benefit of a doubt and still eagerly await his next book."
3,"good,but not block's best","i had been looking forward to reading lawrence block's latest book,but i have to admit that i came away a little disapointed this time.having been robbed recently,i am less inclined to accept a burglar as a hero!even so,i found much of the humor forced this time.try ""the burgler in the library"" it's a much better book.still,lesser lawrence block is better than most other writers out there!"
3,You'll need some rye to follow this plot!,"It's always fun to follow Betnie & Carolyn, but this one is so convoluted, it felt like someone else finished the book when Block lost interest. Back story was still a fun romp"
3,No such thing as a perfect language textbook . . .,"Kim's text is far from useless but I think its' main problem is that it is too compact. I bought the complete book/cassetts/CD set in Taipei before coming to Korea and it was hard to follow, but that does not mean that it is useless. It's just that there's not really such a thing as a perfect Korean learning book.His grammatical points have so far been shown to be helpful if you do as I do and use several different sources while learning. Locally-produced texts tend not to understand quite what foreigners residing in Korea are looking for (tantamount to saying that they don't understand foreigners here! ^_^) and most of what you find tends to be rather ""touristy"", so a good text is worth its weight in gold.Bottom line - Kim's text is useful as long as you have either the cassettes or the CDs with the book. But learning Korean seems to be badly affected by the persistently poor quality of teaching/learning materials generally."
2,I can see this is not up to date by just reading the table of contents....,"I did not read this book. I am living in Korea and have been studying Korean for more than a year. I once embarassed myself by refering to a coffee shop as a 'Ù. These days, regular coffee shops are known as a work very similar to the english ""Coffee Shop"". Dabang have a different connotation. That of the kind of ""coffee shop"" that is actually a cover for company that sells sex. Noone refers to regular coffee shops as Dabang. The back cover of the book says ""completely up to date"". Yet in the table of contents of this books it says ""Meeting friends at the Dabang"". There are so many great new Korean books coming out these days. Why buy something that was published in 1996? Korean culture has changed drastically since then."
2,There are better books out there,"It is really hard to find good books on Korean in the States. Two books I have found that are excellent are Korean Through English 1 and Speaking Korean 1. KTE1 has cassettes and is really good for the absolute beginner. It teaches how to read and write Hangul using the cassettes for pronunciation, then it teaches a lot of useful vocabulary and sentence structures. It is a little weak on grammar. Speaking Korean has no cassettes so learning to read or write Hangul from it is almost impossible unless you have a Phd in linguistics. It does explain grammar very well and it has lots of drills. After finishing this book you should be able to speak Korean quite well. Both of these books are printed by Hollym International Corp of Elizabeth, New Jersey but they are very difficult to find in the States."
1,Only for those who know Korean,"I ordered this book (which was more expensive than most) in hopes of learning the Korean language. It is more of a resource for someone who already has a working knowledge of Korean, and does not seem to be aimed at the non-Korean-speaking student. It may be a 5-star book for someone, but it was not useful at all for me."
2,Badly organised and not really for beginners,"I agree with another reviewer who have difficulty doing the exercises. They demand vocabulary that is not yet introduced in that particular chapter. Grammar is also not well explained. For example, the so-called Rules of honorific and non honorific verbs on page 70 of Chapter 5 is confusing. What are bright and dark verbs anyway?The book is too ambitious and attempts to cramp too much into an introductory course."
2,agreement,"Look at Emyr Pugh's review. He's not just being picky or something; you really would have to be an odd duck to learn very quickly using this book and tape. You would have to memorize about ten lessons before you were able to create any sentences. I'm not an expert here, but I'd suggest Francis Park's book as a better starting place."
2,not any introductiory book,"While this book introduces koresan characters well, it seems that this book reguires you to already have some knowledge or basis in Korean language. It does not seem like it was intended for self-study. And if you do buy this with intents of self-teaching, it is highly recommended that you purchase the tapes with it to help improve korean language hearing and speech. I only use this book as a language enhancer to my primary teaching source."
2,very strange,what a wierd movie! from bad acting to incest i dont know where to begin. the movie is a cross between a bad horror movie and a porno. the director actually manages to keep the viewer in some suspense until about midway through the film then it just gets ridiculous. but if you like cheesy movies you may like this. if you want a real film about cannibalism and an ideology about it watch the movie Ravenous
3,Not as Advertised,"This knife does not have the ""Classic Bolt"" logo. I would not have bought it had I known that it has the ""BUCK"" logo. Although, In all other regards this is a very nice knife."
1,"These knives are made in China, not the USA! Very disappointed",I ordered 3 of these knives as Christmas gifts because the product specs said made in the USA. The knives arrived with a Made in China label. They will be returned immediately. False advertising
4,Buck Stockman,"For the price, it's a good knife for carrying on a daily basis. You won't have a high level of worry for loss, but it is adequate for most things we use a small knife to do. I am impressed with the weight, it feels good in your hand and is very sharp. Down side is made in China."
3,First pocket knife purchased and owned.,"I bought this knife for ~$20 in 2009. While reading the product description, I did not notice where Amazon.com states that it is made in the USA. This was the first knife I ever bought, so I was not at the top of my game. If I had been aware of Amazon's mistake, I would have returned it. Instead, I have used it over the years and it has developed rust on all of the metal parts. Edge retention is not good, but acceptable. The wood handle with gold color accents looks gentlemanly. The product on its own merits is three stars. How much rust it developed is not warranted by light duty and slight exposure to the elements. The blades, easily, can be made sharp, but came dull from the factory. Overall, this is a decent pocket knife, but I have moved onto one handed opening locking knives from Kershaw, Kabar, Spyderco, Boker, CRKT, and others. This was a good starter knife for me."
1,made in china,"If I could rate this zero or less, i would...I did not know, but this buck knife is made in china...I will never buy one again..."
3,ugh! Made in China!!,"The whole reason I ordered this particular knife (I ordered 2) was because the description said ""Proudly Made in the U.S.A."" This is not true! And shame on Amazon for leading us to think so. It is made in China! I'm so disappointed!"
3,"These are made in China, not USA","After a few weeks of having this knife on me, I noticed one of the wooden handle-grips coming unglued. I managed to find the original box it came in to return it, and noticed the sticker that I hadn't seen before. ""Made in China.""I went with Buck specifically because the product was listed as being ""Made in USA."" It's otherwise an OK knife, but it seems like the cheap labor is just that. Buyer beware."
1,Avoid it,"if yu want a Buck knife, get one made in the USA instead of this piece of junk from RED COMMUNIST China."
2,Fact-checking?,"Numerous mistakes that should have been found in the most basic copy review. Page 95 for example - ""Biopatch dressing impregnated with Hibiclens"" - one branded product impregnated with another branded product?! Biopatch is a delivery system for chlorhexidine gluconate, not Hibiclens, which also uses CHG. Takes away from the credibility of the book."
2,"Facts indeed, but not practical for quick exam review","Mundane array of facts after facts, displayed in non-dynamic fashion, I found it very difficult to focus on highlights of pain management topics that are necessary for board exam prepation."
3,I am still looking for a good pain review book.,"Unfortunetaly. It is not meant for board review. There is a big section on how to take the board and the authors are trying to make it look like it is a board review book. But the book like all the other books, does not even touch on the subjects that come up on the exam. For instance pain physiology is big on the exam like WDR. The book discusses briefly WDRs without discussing the important points."
3,Correction Of Mistake Made By Reviewer Anthony C. Rubbo,"Anthony C. Rubbo I am sorry but George Kennedy did not play a sheriff in ""Cool Hand Luke"". You must be referring to the sheriff with the mirrored sun glasses who attempts to brake Paul Newman's unyielding spirit. George Kennedy plays one of the convicts who befriends Paul Newman and idolizes him along with all the other convicts."
5,"GREAT BOOK, AMAZING READ","Had the book many years ago, lent it to someone and never got it back...best book on the subject I have read...very informative and very well documented. Great read...so glad I have a copy once again."
4,Great and simple,"I wanted a simple, plain, handsome tie clip. It's easy to place andgrips just well enough to hold your tie in place in face of erranttugs and pulls as well as in high winds but it doesn't clamp sotight to mark or ruin one's more delicate ties made of materialslike silk, etc.The silver and gold clips are both basic and normal tones thatyou would want to go with everything of the like. Look them up.Great for the price and people can't tell what you paid for theclip--as they retain their shine. Worth the price ten fold."
5,Lovely tie clasp!,"I was looking for a simple clasp of high quality. This one has no ripples and is shiny clean. Would be great with an engraving too. It doesn't mess up the tie after wearing, and its length is just perfect. It came in a lovely black velvet box. Was shipped super fast!"
2,Ouch!,"Lightning bolts are cute. However, the posts are LONG! So long that I have to take them out whenever I lay down because they stab me in the sides of my head. Had I known that before, I never would have bought them!"
3,love em but...,"These earrings are pretty. I like the way they look, but the longer posts poke me constantly. When the earring turns in the piercing, the stud looks more like an anvil than a lightning bolt. That started an interesting conversation. All in all exactly what I was looking for though."
2,Cute but sharp,"I bought these because I thought they would be perfect to just keep in my ears for days at a time. I have several peircings in each ear so its easiest to not have to take them out all the time... but these star points are EXTREMELY sharp, theres no way I could keep these in over night, I did once and woke up with red rings all around the earing...so I dont even bother wearing them..."
2,"A Valuable Concept, but an Unnessary Addition to your Personal Library","I can summarize the full content of this work in one sentence: Apply every technique you learn to everything you know how to play.That's it. If you already know the modes, and already know thump and pluck, just combine every variation of technique with every mode in every key.That's a great lesson, so you don't get stuck on applying a technique to a specific set of notes or a particular style of music. You don't need a book to do this though. You can (and should) do it on your own in the most creative way that you know how."
1,Very disappointed,"This book is definitely not for the advanced musician. I was expecting more from the book. If you're expecting advanced instructions like the Flea or John Pattitucci books, this is not the book to purchase. I must say with the size of the book and the beginner style instructions, I was very disappointed with this purchase."
1,TAB only?,I saw that it said TAB only and that's all I needed to know.I could never recommend a TAB only book to anyone @ any level.
2,Hoping for better,"Although this disc has some good moments, I was hoping for more instrumental material. For me, the vocals ruin it! Maybe it's just my taste in vocalists. The band does get into some interesting grooves and rhythms, but there's hardly any inspired soloing from any of the members(with the possible exception of some of the sax work). I would go so far as to say that from what I've heard I might be willing to try another one-there is some good potential here. It just didn't do it for me overall."
4,Zzebra Don't Panic,"Lost World is a ""new"" album from 1975, and boasts some great material, studio & live. The only other album I had heard from them is ""Panic"" from 1975. This includes that title song done live--very well done, they are an excellent live band. A highly energetic and talented band, Zzebra has a unique sound...jazz, rock, funk etc. I highly recommend this album to anyone who loves rock jazz fusion from this era. Buy It!"
4,Fun in a small package,"I bought this book for a friend of mine, but I read it first, and I have to say it was tons of fun. In the spirit of Jack Handy, Pam Gaslow offers up her random little thoughts, observations, and witticisms about life and, well, womanhood. A friend came by and picked it up and started reading...between the giggles I heard her declare that she wanted to buy a copy for all her girl friends. If you like whimsical (and sometimes non-sequitur) comedy, then you will really enjoy this book."
3,Not Very Useful,"I had to use this for a computer mapping class, except everything from the book was covered in the professors lab handouts in an even more logical and understandable fashion. Why professors must insist you buy the text book and then provide you with resources that render it obsolete is a mystery. This book was not cheap I caution you to be very careful before buying it you might not need it at all. As for if you have to rely on the book it's not terrible but there's nothing in the book that does not scream ""generic textbook"" if your skilled at utilizing text books it will help you, if not it will hinder you. Don't expect to get too much from it, some of it's instruction were very poorly written and you will need guidance from the professor to get through if it's your first GIS course."
2,Bachmann Train Water Tower/ 0 scale,"In the description, it says that this water tower is 0 scale. I purchased it. Assembly was easy and I started my layout. As I purchased more 0 Scale buildings and started laying down my track, I set the water tower by the track and ran the locomotive by it. One thing is for sure.....this is NOT 0 Scale!!! LOL! Way too small. I would say that it is HO scale. It is not Amazon's fault....it is Bachmann's fault for selling a product that is not correct scale. Luckily for me, a friend is working on an HO layout and it looks good on it. I recently purchased a Lionel water tower and that is the REAL DEAL!!!!"
3,"OK, but colors don't match image","Item has a light brown roof, spout, ladder and girders (versus grey / chrome depicted). The tank is grey (versus the brass color depicted).Easy to put together, though the structure just sits on the black base (it does not attach to it in any way).Mine arrived with the spike at the very top broken off...rather than return it, I just used some super glue...Overall, it's OK...I would rate it higher if the colors were as presented...you can of course paint it..."
1,wrong item,this is a great product but it's packaged wrong it's ho not o gauge.the box even says o-gauge but like i said it's HO. still a great product---just use glue!
2,"irritated, but not surprised","This work is astounding in its profound ignorance not only of contemporary psychoanalysis, but of psychoanaytic developments in the last half of the 20th century (and also of much of contemporary neurobiology). The arrogance here is amazing -- to write a book without even attempting to familiarize oneself with th subject matter; but, we must ask, where is this arroagnce coming from? I believe Kitcher well demonstrate the law, ""Academics moves toward the trendy, occasionally errs, self-corrects and moves again toward the trendy."""
5,Groundbreaking research -- Insights still valid today,"A look behind the myths and legends, Lee's groundbreaking book relied on extensive interviews with the women who sought and obtained abortions -- legal, illegal, quasi-legal, and self-induced -- in the days before legalization. Lee examines the factors that led women to choose abortion, the means by which they found an abortionist, and their attitudes toward their experiences. This book is a must read for prochoice and prolife alike."
5,A foundational book for social networks research,"Nancy Lee Howell's book is an excellent case study on information transmitted through social networks. In this sense, the book foreshadows Ronald Burt, Mark Granovetter, and others."
5,My son loves it!,Although my son is only 2 I believe this toy will grow with him for a few more years. It teaches numbers and letters and elementary spelling and even has some fun features like e-mail (pretend). The fact that it has a QWERTY keyboard and mouse is what my son loves the most because it looks like Mommy and Daddy's computer. I'd definitely recommend this.
4,"Simple, Easy to use Interface",Very simple and easy to use. Seems quite durable as my 4 yr old son often drags it from room to room. A great toy to play with as a family if you have children under 5.
1,so bad i went to the effort to share my experience,"product didn't last long at all. i went back to the maker (learning journey) as well as the distributor (csn stores/toysandgamesonline.com) and both declined to do anything as it was no longer in production. thank god the intended receiver of this gift is now on to the real thing, but his younger brothers won't be able use this product, which is always a consideration, nor will i be able to make any claim (paypal) on the good money i've wasted. bad business leads to no business."
2,Serves its purpose... for awhile,The lotion applicator has a flimsy handle with a sponge at the end. The sponge doesn't cover the sides of the handle so it often scratches your back and other hard to reach areas. You are better off applying lotion to a towel and reaching around than to this.
3,Easy Reach Lotio Applicator,"I purchased the Easy Reach Lotion Applicator. I needed something to use when I go to the tanning booth in order to put the lotion on my back and thought, this would be the ultimate solution. The product works ok, but if you put any type of pressure on it, at the bend that you can see in photo's where it folds, has a tendency to pop in half. I would recommend it for the price paid compared to the same products I have seen. Just be aware if it's not one piece it's not sturdy."
3,Serves its purpose,"While this lotion dispenser serves it purpose adequately, there is an uneven weight distrubtion that causes the applicator to fold up when using. It could be better, but the idea sure is great."
3,LOTION APPLICATOR,I ordered this for an elderly person and find that it is too short for those who do not have the dexterity of young to middle aged people. An additional 4 to 6 inches in length would benefit this particular group.
5,Ottowa Jewish Bulletin,"A Touch of the High Holidays is a novelty board book. It includes all the Jewish holidays that occur in the month of Tishri, from Rosh Hashanah to Simchat Torah. Two page spreads describe several aspects of each holiday before settling on one that is reinforced by something to touch. Feel the many textures of our holidays - the stickiness of honey, the smoothness of a machzor cover, the bumpiness of an esrog, and the velvety softness of a Torah cover. Best of all, children will see themselves in a sukkah. Definitely a hands-on winner."
3,Only for Those With Prior Knowledge,"As someone who is not Christian and only knows the basics of the New Testement (and doesn't know the difference between any of the gospels), I came into Marked with a lot of expectations. Having read about it in Newsweek, I expected the story of an outsider and to learn about a religion I don't know about. The book is without a doubt meant for Christians. No background is given on the characters, we're supposed to know that Jesus is who he is, that Simon is Simon, and the land is corrupt. I was left confused and slightly frustrated at several moments. Also, a lot of the drama just wasn't there for me. Since this is an adaptation, I guess the reader is supposed to be waiting for certain moments. It just didn't work for me.That being said, there were some moments I enjoyed. The devil is great, and the pages that lead up to the crucifixition are better than The Passion any day of the week.Recommended for the Christian graphic novel fan."
3,Marked,"To echo Mr. Grossman, This definitely a book that is for Christians looking for a new way to look at the Gospel of Mark. The wild world that Jesus inhabits within this book brings a fun image of Christ, but does not delve deep into the theological mindset of Mark or the future implications of following Jesus. However, it is a fun retelling of the Scriptures in a way that is serious, but at the same time does not take itself too seriously. Also, it allows one to see those who are considered outcasts in a better light, as we see the disciples in such a different mode than they are typically imaged. This would make a great study for any youth or young adult group, or a great weekend read for anyone open to new interpretations of the scriptures."
4,A factual account,"Having watched the TV series (and loved it) I was expecting more of a story, but instead it was more of a series of ""case studies"". Some left me wanting more, others were probably a bit more graphic than expected; but overall I still really enjoyed this book. It was interesting to note how midwifery practice has changed over the years - how on some levels women would now pay a fortune for the level of care (weekly home visits and home births) for something that was once considered standard. the imagery of post war london, particularly the East End, was vivid and shocking. The thought that people in a modern country were living in such poverty was something that hadn't occured to me.Overall, well worth the read for anyone with an interest in nursing / medical history"
5,well worth reading,"I watched the PBS series based on this book...sometimes book and show don't match well but these two complimented each other. If you didn't see the show it is still worth while, especially for anyone interested in medical history or just how things were in London after the war. If you did see the series this gives a depth to the people seen in the series and more background. Her writing is interesting and shows us things are not always as they seem at first glance. Well worth reading."
4,Great insight,"A wonderful thought provoking view of 1950s east London and its inhabitants. Looking forward to reading the others. Highly recommend, an easy read."
5,Call the midwife,"This is a wonderful book.Jennifer has the ability to understand people. She can bring you into their characters.You may laugh and cry along with her.I too have been a nurse/midwife for past 40+ years and have met many individuals in my time.Life has it,s many ups and downs but I,m glad I made my career choice years ago.This book has been a history lesson from the past.I am looking forward to enjoying the next two books about the workhouse."
4,Life and Times in the 50s,"This is definitely a book for women and for anyone wanting to be a nurse. I enjoyed reading it and learned a lot about the female anatomy in OB/GYN and the hard lives people lead in the early 50s. However, after several chapters it was difficult to digest the detailed medical terms and procedures and I could not read and eat at the same time. However, I continued on because Jennifer Worth is a good story teller and the book is interesting and informative. Around chapter 9 or so the details were kept to a minimum and the stories became even more enjoyable."
4,Call the Midwife,I choose the rating based on my enjoyment level of the book. Enjoyed the characters and the history of the story.
5,Excellent,"Ordered this after seeing the tv production and finished it in an afternoon, I couldn't put it down. Really evokes the 50s in England (I was there for part of it, full disclosure) and the characters are vivid, their stories moving. If you like James Herriot, you will love these books as well."
5,Very entertaining!,I enjoyed this book so much that I bought one as a gift for a friend of mine who is a retired nurse!
5,Really well written,"This book was fantastic. I loved it, plain and simple. Warning though, don't let your kids just read it. There are some pretty graphic details about the prostitution that went on in the East end. But it was real and it wasn't played up to be lascivious, it was just what happened, which is why I wasn't offended by it. It was beautifully written and sad without being depressing. Loved it."
5,An amazing tale,"After watching the first season, reading the detailed version of the stories has been a delight. Written so well you can almost ""smell"" the described scenes. Looking forward to reading the next two books as well."
5,It really was like that!,"Unfortunately life in the East End, as we used to call it, was full of hardship, but the midwives, and others like them made life tolerable for many a working family. The memoir rings true. Its humor reminds me of the cockneys who have almost disappeared, who found something to smile at in every tragedy, something to smile at, no matter how miserable and sad they felt inside."
5,Loved it,As a fan of the TV series I found this book gave a deeper look at the English nurses training from the 1950-1970's and the midwife's role in early public health then.
4,I Liked it.,I enjoyed the book however did not really need all the sexually graphic stuff. I got the point without all that. Sure was a difficult time to live in.
5,Reality Learning,There are not a sufficient number of accolades for this book. Highly recommend as a way to learn historical truths and realities -- often these are not exposed. This book was purchased and read with the encouragement of the PBS series.
3,call the midwife,"Overall a very fascinating read.The author really captures the life and times of the poor in post war England without being patronizing. However it ended very oddly,as if she forgot a chapter or two.:"
3,insight into times past,Enjoyable and interesting look into times past in the world of women and babies. A good way to while away some time.
4,Worth the read,Really enjoyed the stories told along with the colorful backdrop of the East end of London. Nice writing style. A gem!
5,Wonderful,"I loved this book. It is honest,sad,funny and humble. She shares her life story and the stories of others. Lovely."
4,Don't just watch the TV series,read this book! Social history combined with great stories makes for a really good read! it will make you eternally grateful for the Public health system we all now enjoy!
5,Great Story,Loved this book watched some of the episopdes on T.V. earlier in the year but enjoyed the book even more would recommend it highly
3,Hoe Births in the slums of London,An interesting account of what life was like for the poor of London and for the midwives who looked after them.It's hard to believe today - with modern medicine and hospitals available to expecting parents today.H.T.
4,An interesting history of midwifery in England.,"Call the Midwife. Very British in its clinical style, though interesting to learn about post war London's docks and the art of midwifery."
3,Just okay.,I enjoyed this book except for the chapter on prostitution. This chapter was too graphic and overshadowed the rest of the book for me.
4,Call The Midwife,This was an easy read and had some good character development. In parts it made me laugh and cry. I had no idea that the living conditions and basic health care were so primitive in England in the 1950's ... no so long ago!
5,call the midwife review,I really enjoyed this book having been a midwife myself for twenty years although certainly not in the 1950's!The characters are likable and you want to know how they get on. For me I enjoyed knowing what it was like to be a midwife in those days although I am grateful to have practised when women and midwives had access to more pain relieving and life saving medication and equipment! However in this modernization process we have lost the independence that midwives had in those days and women have lost the right to homebirth.
5,The MIdwife,"I loved this book, I bought the whole series and recommend them to anyone interested in transporting yourself to another place and time. It certainly makes me glad for the time we live in now! The characters are real and the books makes you wish you had the chance to meet them."
5,Call the Midwife. I loved it.,"I loved this book. The author tells her story of changing her perceptions about people as she learns more and more about their lives. It is a story of her growing up and developing. Additionally, her experiences touched me deeply enough that I found myself crying numerous times about her patient's lives."
5,Better than the PBS series,This is a quick read and better than the PBS TV series. If you liked the series you should read this.
4,Interesting and pleasant to read,"How fortunate we are to live and give birth in two thousand... something... It is hard to imagine that life in that part of London was so poor and unfortunate, only half a century ago. A good reminder of the blessings of today."
4,I liked the Midwife.,it was interesting to see what nursing in London was like in the 50's. I was a student nurse then. our conditions were so much better. we didn't know how lucky we were.I would recommend to other nurses or people in the medical profession. Wasn't interested in the language explanation at the end.
5,Amazing.,"I picked up this whole serie after watching the BBC series Jennifer Worth left us with a brilliant and sometimes very hard to read (and occasionally heartbreaking) series on life in the east end of London. While the midwifery side is the main focus, she also worked as a community nurse as well giving a view on some very real characters and a spotlight on their lives."
3,Wrong size screws included,Planet Bike's own instructions note that the included screws for the rear eyelets are too short for these two stay rear fenders. Apparently they can't be bothered to customize the hardware packs to their various fenders. That makes for an annoying trip to the hardware store for a brand new product.Other than that they were easy to install and fit to my ATB commuting bike.
4,"good fenders, hardware lacking","The fenders themselves were great; very sturdy, but the mouting hardware that came with them seemed like a random assortment of nuts, bolts , screws and zip ties seemingly unrelated to fender mounting. Mounting these fenders to a hard tail MTB with front suspension, especially the front, requires creative thinking and a trip to the hardware store! I cut some slots out of a hose clamp on the stationary side (not the side that moves in/out when twisting the screw) to allow the threads but not the head of a machine screw (small flat head bolt) to fit through. Several wraps of an old innertube secured with tape cushion the fork from the hose clamp / screw head. The loop end of the fender stay fits over the machine screw and secures with a washer and nut. Extra ""tail"" on the hose clamp can be cut with a hacksaw or bent back and forth with pliers and broken off."
4,Fit good and mounted easily,I have an older Schwinn MTB that I mainly use for neighborhood transportation and these fenders mounted right on no problem. I do wish they had included and extra mounting clip that fit around the fender that really seems to firm up the entire set-up and having one on the front would make a huge difference. good quality and durability so far had them on about 60 days now.
3,Fenders,"""universal"" fit can be tricky. They fit...after some cutting and bolting a new hole plus a few extra modifications so they wouldn't interfere with the tires and brakes.They now work. and I have high hopes they will keep the wet stripe off my back ( and elsewhere) during inclement weather."
2,Not so universal,"I've heard some good things about Planet Bike, but they appear to be letting their accountants run the show. The fenders themselves are of good quality, but they skimped on the hardware necessary to attach the fender to the bike. I don't know the particular model they had in mind when they provided a bare minimum of nuts and bolts, but they probably won't fit your bike. You will have to supplement their meager offerings with a trip to the hardware store. Interestingly, of the 8 bolts they included, only 2 had nuts. It would probably have only cost them an extra 25 cents to include some additional ties, and hardware. For what is ostensibly a universal fender, the inadequate attachment hardware is disappointing."
3,Nice fenders - needs some redesign,"These are overall nice bike fenders. Beings that most new bikes consider fenders optional these will keep you dry. Installation was easy. Problem, I feel, is in the design. The support brackets are adjustable. That's good. The extra portions of the support brackets that are not used are an eyesight sore. That's bad. They should be designed so that the adjustment is at the wheel and not at the fender. In this way the fender has a nice clean look. The extra that is not used at the wheel could then just be nipped off with a wire cutter. I could be wrong but that's my opinion."
3,Limp is stellar.,The album is solid with a few stand-up songs like Entertainer and Bag Lunch. But what's a little disappointing is that it is a lot slower than Pop & Disorderly. Overall though it's solid.
3,LIMPPPP,I just bought this CD a few days ago...i'm impressed. I like the lyrics and i like this CD allot.
5,An experience unparralled by any recent musical ventures,"A floating streaming of symphonic harmonies transcending thought and emotion. This seminal effort by Limp is full of unrestrained notes and melodies, with each song eloquently articulating heart-felt narratives of strength and passion. In 1991 Nirvana emerged and charted the course for Rock N Roll in this decade. With Guitarded, Limp emerges as heirs to the throne, prepared to navigate a new direction with their brand of smart and accessible punk rock. Each song is carefully woven into a flourishing colorful bouquet of intelligent and meaningful substance. The album evokes memories of translucent summer days spent creating provocative dreams.Brilliant, simply brilliant!!!"
4,Awesome,"This product is awesome! It's great for travel, particularly with the new airline regulations about liquids. It also does a great job on my hair. It leaves it clean, shiny and fluffy without being frizzy."
2,not for me,"I have colored hair and this shampoo bar made my hair super dry. I love the idea of it- no wasteful packaging, easy to use bar etc. but I quickly had to switch back to my regular shampoo... probably works well if you don't have highlighted hair?...."
3,Mheee,"It get's your hair clean, but you will look like you didn't rinse all the way by the end of the day. I used the full bar to give it time to ""work."" It didn't.If you have oily hair, this product make it look like you don't bathe every day and may give you dandruf. At least that's what it did for me."
4,"Cheap, but good...","Makes you wonder about the mark-up on equal quality/type goods from the expensive ""brand names."" (At this price, you can't go wrong.)"
3,Replace the chain,"I love the look of the pendant and got many compliments when I wore it, but the chain gets wrapped up in my hair and ends up pulling out a big tangle. If your hair is long, beware! I will have to try to replace the chain with something that doesn't latch on."
4,....looks good to me,....will be given away as a gift. I am pleased. I hope the receiver will be.I like the chain which I believe can worn separately or with another item?
4,nice,"The perfect size, design, and style. She loved it. It went perfect with the sterling silver cuff that I purchased from Amazon too. A sure fire way to have your bases covered!"
4,Looks great,"Received this necklace as a gift from my husband. I absolutely love it, though I have one complaint. Due to how it was packaged, the chain is permanently bent in a couple spots. You can't tell while looking at it, but it does bother me that it was received damaged."
2,Not for long hair unless you replace the chain,"The pendant is very pretty, but I admit I was a little surprised at how big it was (I didn't pay a lot of attention to the measurements). The diameter is a tad over an inch! The pendant itself has a very smooth finish so it does have a machined look rather than a crafted look, but it's still a lovely design.However, the chain, while it looks nice, is absolutely terrible if you have long hair as it catches and tangles hair very badly. Each little subunit of the chain flexes if it's curved (like it is around your neck), and your hair can get trapped in the gaps. I had to cut some hair to remove the necklace; it was tangled up that badly. Part of the price you pay includes the value of the chain, so this really reduces the value of the pendant."
1,So disappointed,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister. The size of the pendant is alright, but it's paper thin and so cheap looking that it looks like something you might give a child to play with. In fact, I'm sending it to my daughter-in-law to pass on to one of her many young nieces as a stocking stuffer. So very disappointing - and so confusing as to why there were so many favorable comments on it. Sometimes I think the manufacturers pay people to say nice things about lousy products. Save your money and buy something else."
1,Poor Quality,I was very disappointed in the quality of this necklace. It is very flimsy and lightweight and the chain did not lay flat because it was slightly bent. I returned the necklace and would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Disappointed,"This is the third time I have purchased this product but I am very disappointed this time. The packaging of this product from my prior two purchases were impeccable and it was a great gift for ladies in any occasions; it came with a little cute pouch made of soft velvet along with a product certification brochure inside the box. But now, despite the product looks the same but the little pouch is replaced with a large cheap looking pouch without any product brochure which makes it look cheap and undesirable..."
5,Very Pretty Necklace,I purchased this necklace for my mother-in-law for Christmas. It arrived very quickly and she loves it!
5,Impressive,"I purchased this during a Lightning Deal. Even at the regular price, this piece is a great buy, given the price of silver as of late. It makes an impressive gift presentation, looks expensive. I doubt anyone would be disappointed. If I hadn't purchased it for my daughter, I'd keep it for myself."
4,Review,The pendant is really nice. A lot of detail. The chain is too short. but easily fixed I bought a longer chain.
3,Nice pendant,"I like this pendant. I don't think it is quite as pretty or interesting looking in reality as in the photo on the Amazon site. I'm not sure why that is. It's fine, just a bit generic and not all that eye catching."
5,Beautiful,"This necklace is every bit as beautiful in real life as it is in the picture. It goes with a lot of things since it's such a neutral color, and I've gotten many complements about it. Most definitely one of my favorite necklaces!"
3,"Beautiful design, but paper thin.","It is a beautiful design and as big as it looks. However it is paper thin. I am keeping it, but not a thick rounded pendant as it looks online."
3,nice pendant but a junky chain,"The pendant is pretty and has fairly nice craftsmanship. But I could not give this as a gift because the snake chain is a poor quality - stiff, with several lumpy areas - and needs to be replaced.I don't think the pendant is worth the price if it needs a new chain, so it will be returned."
5,Beautiful,"I love this pendant. Very shiny and substantial - the back looks as good as the front. I also wear this on a black leather cord (16"") and it gives it a whole new look. Great buy."
2,Buy the others instead,"I bought this AFTER some of the others (such as, ""Favorite Fundation Pieced Minis"") and therefore I was disappointed. Since this was written, foundation techniques have improved. Money is better spend on Doak's later work or other, more recent books on foundation piecing. (If you haven't tried foundation piecing, though, do yourself a favor and so - it lets those of us with minimal talent look very good!)"
2,Solid but nothing special,"I really don't get all the gushing 5-star reviews for this book. Some of the chapters are solid, but its full of filler [the tattoo chapter????], and final images that are frankly embarrassing. Kevin Ames' book [photographing Women] is WAY better [and more interestingly written]. You should also check out Chris Orwig's retouching stuff on lynda.com - also more valuable."
2,Not what I thought it would be. Didn't care for this book.,"To be such a ""complete"" guide, I was not a fan of this book. Some of the techniques seem to be better done other ways, in my experience, and I didn't gain much from reading this one. I'm not a photoshop guru, with fairly limited photoshop skills, but I would recommend Kelby's books instead. This book did have a good description of correcting skin tones using color picker and RGB to CMYK values and choosing black/white points in the image, but this can be easily found elsewhere and doesn't necessitate a full purchase. I would recommend staying away from this one."
5,Nailed it.,This book filled in lots of gaps fixing problems I was having getting good skin tones right out of the camera. Helped me a bunch.
5,Indespensible,"This book is indespensible for serious amateur and professional photographers. You can spend hundreds of dollars buying a collection of other books and they won't approach the content and quality of this book. The content equals photography school material and then some. There's a CDROM included with images and Adobe .PDFs to accomplish for yourself what the author has written about. I've waited a long long time for this information. It sets the standard and the price is so low, it's unbelievable. I wish I worked for the author."
2,Overdone,"The techniques may be useful, but the application is way overdone. Many of the 'after' photos look as if mortician's wax has been caked on the models. Very unnatural and unappealing."
5,Advanced Photoshop,"With a quick review of basics, this book quickly delves into more complex tasks that are rarely addressed in other so-called ""Advanced Photoshop"" manuals. During a period where I'm finding it consistently difficult to find books which can teach me things I have not already learned about PS, ""Skin"" provides both new information, and a different viewpoint on things already known."
4,New tricks for old dogs,"Though I've worked in Photoshop since 1992 and work extensively retouching my own and client's images, this book offered a few new tricks to this old dog. Though aspects of lighting and shooting are more oriented toward novice photographers, the retouching techniques are are worthwhile for even advanced/experienced shooters."
4,Fantastic book,I think is a very good book I am very interested on this kind of book in my country there arent book about skin retouch that is why I bought.I am learning a lot with this book thanks for everything.Mayte
4,Great Examples,this book has some really good examples of skin retouching and new ways of working with skin.
2,technical over-kill?,"This approach seems to be too technical, too scientific. I think you can just use your eyes to tell good color balance, because it's an esthetic thing anyway. For example, Joe McNally takes liberties with lighting his models by putting down gold reflector cloth and flashing with tungsten conversion filters on. Is this realistic skin tones? No. Does it work esthetically? You bet. Just use your eyes and esthetic sense - you'll be way ahead rather than get into your head too much over calibration, etc. Just look at Scott Kelby's books and the Nikon CLS DVD. (even if you use canon, etc.)"
4,"Good job, Lee!!","Getting skin color right has been an issue. It's good to know you can get it right, and if you don't do it in camera, you can learn the right way to make it right."
2,"Could be of help, possibly...","I can see how this book might help some people, but it is not well done by any means.One of my biggest problems with this book is that it doesn't even have all of the odd number problems in it. On several occasions, I looked for a similar odd problem to an even numbered assigned HW problem, so I could try to figure out HOW to do the problem, and that odd problem wasn't in there.Some student solutions manuals are very helpful. This one is not, but might help some people if it happens to have the problem you want to see."
3,"Ordered the dog, got the Einstein","Ordered as a gag gift, can't think of another reason for wanting a Chia Pet. We had fun with it, but they did send the wrong version...got the Einstein instead of the dog"
5,Excellent resource,"""Uncle John"" has been a staple reference for bread making since it was first published almost 40 years ago. If you want to understand the basics, this is the book for you. Most of the breads have an ""old world"" taste and texture but they lend themselves nicely to modifications and updates.I'm on my third copy now - would still be on the first if I hadn't loaned it out so often. And the hardcover works best because it is easier to open flat. Tip - if you want to keep the pages clean, lay a piece of clear plastic across the open pages."
3,"Sampled, repetitive background dance music","Basic, cutely sampled dance rhythms. My complaint is that the tracks are a bit musically repetitive - there's less build up and break down, fewer chord changes than I was looking for."
1,Bad,"This product is horrible. I tried is for my green anoles, ant it totally burned one, and killed the other."
5,Work great,I purchased this item to cut through heavy duty international package straps. Safe & easy to use.
4,excellent intro,"The introduction to this book is one of the best explanations of Solstice customs and celebrations I've ever come across. The stories themselves are an acquired taste imho, but that is the nature of these old stories."
4,Lucille Ball and Dick Van Dyke...,...were two of the pioneers of physical comedy and helped make broadcast TV the incredible success it became in 1960's. Those 12 digitally remastered episodes consist of their best-loved episodes.
5,Not liking it for those reasons is just STUPID!!,"This is an intelligent and incredible play buy a brilliant author. If you don't like it, the least you could do is come up with a legitimate reason. This play is a true original. Schaffer knokws how to create and evolve tragic characters, situations, and emotions that few contemporary playwrites can. Not as good as Equus, but still very very good."
3,"Great Play, but the book won't last","Amadeus is one of the greatest plays ever written, so it's too bad that the publishers decided to print it on rough tissue paper with a cover on par with $4 bargain books. Shame on you Harper Perennial."
5,RECOMMENDED READING,"This is a wonderful book on Jainism - for those who know nothing about it as well as those who already have some background. It has a lot of good information but it is also very easy to read. Dr. Parikh has explained the concepts thoroughly and in an interesting way. You can definitely tell that he has experience as a teacher.He presented the history and background clearly, and I have to say, it makes sense. You don't get the feeling that he is being preachy, which is refreshing.The principles of Jainism are relevant to everyone, no matter what religion they practice. Anyone interested in a ""peaceful world"" (and who's not?) would enjoy reading this book. Indeed, the book is published by Peace Publications - how perfect.The book also has examples of stunning monuments and art. Overall I enjoyed it and found it useful for me and my family.*RECOMMENDED*"
1,Grim is what you feel after paying money for it,"The worst movie. So cheaply made and looks like something a teenager made. Director gave me a copy of the movie and it was the most unbearable, painful experience. Horrible dialog, horrible cinematography, just all over terrible. Effects were bad and looked like corn syrup and red food coloring. Stupid plot. DO NOT WASTE your money on this crap. There is no gore, no action, nothing. It makes itself look like a gory fun time, but it is not."
5,nice knife,"thick blade , shave my arm with no problem out of the box. some sawing tooth will be the only thing this knife needs."
5,Great feel,"I bought this knife 8/20/10, and its great! Came razor sharp. I cut myself on accident by barley taping it on my thumb. I would not recomend as a playing knife or for show because it can do some serious damage. But if your a hunter; Skinning, gutting, whatever you do. hell you could kill a deer with this beauty. Its feels great in hand.How about I sum this up?Pro:Extremly sharpFeels great in handFull tangCons:Well.... If you want to quickly take it out, the sheath dosnt really give you that advantage, but thats a personal matter"
4,Nice looking,Bought this for my husband for christmas. He has not opened it yet. It looks and feels good in your hand. The blade is very sharp.I gave it 4 stars because we have not used it yet.
2,Color doesn't last!,"I used Pur Minerals eye shadow for several years. I liked the color options, but they all faded after being appled very quickly. I thought it was an isuue with my skin type. I recently ran out of a Pur color that's no longer available and used an eye shadow palette made by another company that had been in a drawer. The color still looked great at the end of the day. Subsequently, I'm no longer using Pur Minerals.I wrote a review similar to this one for the Pur Minerals site. It was my personal experience with the product, I didnt mention the name of the other manufacturer. They never posted it. It sheds a new light on all the Pur Minerals products with 4 1/2 and 5 star average user reviews on their web site."
3,neat little bag,"It fits close to your body and is lightweight. However, it did not take me too long to run out of room in it. I use it now and then, but it does not hold as much as the Ameribag healthy back bag, which I like much better."
5,Love This Bag,Got the bag today start adding contain from other bag. This purse have lot of room for me to add more stuff. I like the thick straps. I don't like the thin straps on other bags. That why I pick this style and Always wanted a Nine West purse.
3,Is it a matter of taste?,"I'm sorry I don't think she is a very good poet.Her screen plays are an entirely different kettle.I Know Why the Caged Bird SingsThis review has me scared.Only by politics could such bad poetry get a prize.If that is the case,then American literature is in a bad case."
3,Alright documentary but not that special,I thought it was gonna be much better but it wasn't. It was an average documentary which I'm glad I didn't spend any money on. Most Beef's are old news but there are a few cool moments like when NATE DOGG beats down haters at a golf-course: funny as hell.But overall: Nothing Special.
1,Beef,"Beef 1 is the best one of the 4,the only reason worth watching is Pac',all the rest is just post-1996(Rap Game is Dead)malarkey,Biggie,G a y -Z, flab boy,mobb sleep are all whack, East Coast Rap unless it's 80s or BDI and Bootcamp Clik/SmiffnWessum it doesn't matter, And all these so-called ""Positive Rappers"" as Willie D once said Positivity ain't getting nobody paid. All these back-packers read Fake muslims(Nation of Islam is a Radical Communist Sect-yet they have an monopoly on bean pies and providing security for the industry,ironically the suspect last seen around BIG was an Bowtie wearing ""Peaceful"" follower.) The only ones worth listening to Yukmouth,Scarface,Willie D,Dru Down,E-40,Bone,Spice 1,GrandMaster Flash,Big Daddy Kane,but all these others are all over rated,Krs-one is one self centered sucka MC.Backpackers or bling rap is still dead."
3,Everyone has beef,"For those not up to date with who is mad at who, or who was fighting and isn't anymore, this is for you..."
2,Boring,"I didn't find this DVD too bad to watch, but I wouldn't watch it again. It had tons of good artists but I dont wanna have to sit down and watch a whole bunch of interviews. I think this DVD needed a lot more action of rappers on the streets or somethin, just my opinion."
5,The best one,"This is the best beef dvd out of all three of them. You get to the early battles like busy bee vs. kool mo dee, nwa vs ice cube,eazy e vs dr.dre, to today biggest battles like jay-z vs. nas and 50 cent vs murder inc. I do wish that they did have other big battles on here like eminem vs. benzino or mobb deep vs jay-z. But still this dvd is for any die hard hip hop fan. You won't be dissapointed when you buy this. You get interviews from rappers themselves as they tell you their side of the story."
3,beef review,"this dvd needed something to spice it up, we all knew we were watching a documentary on hip hop beef but c'mon there are ways to make a dvd more interesting"
5,killer klassic queen,"Awesome! This is one of my alltime favorite live recordings along with KISS Alive! KISS Alive! II, Peter Brampton Comes Alive, Aero Smith, W.A.S.P: Raw, Iron Maiden Live After Death"
3,Queen live killers,"This vendor did not like my feedback where I said that he could have cleaned the chocolate and jelly fingerprints before mailing it to me. He emailed me ""did you lick it off or just do yourself?"" If you enjoy being insulted with filthy language in response to having spent your money with this vendor, you won't be disappointed."
4,Return to Form,"Many Chitose fans were displeased with her choice of music for her second album 'Nomad Soul.' They need not worry about this new single. It is everything we all loved about her first album and more. The title track is a beautiful sweeping melody full of Chitose's vocal forte. The second 'Tsuki wo Nusumu' is a gorgeously calming track that could bring anyone to tears. Chitose's emotional vocals are quietly brought back to the table with this lovely track. 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' is an alright track. Her English is understandable, but not the best, and the track itself is a bit short. The only thing that really disappointed me about this release was the DVD. It's only about 2 minutes and 30 seconds of random BLOOD anime clips. I would really have liked to have seen a PV or something, anything really. All in all, it's a good single, but you'd probably be better off buying the CD only version."
3,Is it a women's ball or not?,"I'm trying to by a Men's Spalding TF-1000 basketball and the text describing this ball includes the words Women's ball on it after a series of other Spalding descriptors?The photo is of a Men's 29.5 ball, not a women's ball. I would like to buy a number of men's balls, but am confused by the listing!"
4,Loads of fun...,"...and supremely catchy! Her voice sounds cool and calm, but it's like the perfect foil to the pop. Music you can dance to and blare out of the speakers if you feel like a little lift."
2,Poor,"I hated it! The music is lame and awkward, the lyrics dorky, and Sopie is the most inept singer! I thought read my lips was witty dancehall fun but this is oh pleeeease..."
4,Good product,The CD came as promised-brand new and factory sealed. Works perfectly. Smooth transaction.
3,The Sophmore attempt,"Sophie Ellis-Bextor's sophmore album was like more of a review of ""Read My Lips"" and ""Trip the Light Fantastic"" (which I loved) it was indie pop and Britpop combined. Unlike the third and first albums respectively I found myself skipping tracks and I had to listen to some tracks three times before I thought they were decent. My favorites are You Get Yours (which should have been a single), Mixed Up World, the Walls Keep Saying Your Name, and I Won't Change You. Other than that her sophmore effort was medicore."
3,not usa,I bought these because the picture shows USA on the cutters. Actually they are made in Tiawan. If I had known this I would have bought an American made brand.
4,route 66 season 3 vol. one,very nostalgic...enjoyable...love all the old shows...great way to watch tv shows from my childhood...fun to watch again & again
5,Season 3 Route 66...very good quality!!!,"According to TV on DVD website, this is the true Season 3 release of Route 66....I believe it is Vol 1.The Feb release of Route 66 is a best of.Buyer beware.Update: I am very impresseed by the picture quality of Season 3 Vol 1 of Route 66. Wish season 1 was as good. Season 3 Vol 2 is scheduled for release on Oct 20th, 2009. Can't wait!!!"
5,Classic CD!,"I heard some of their songs on the radio and began reminiscing, it's so fortunate to be able to find the CD on amazon so I can hear their songs whenever I feel like it."
3,"Superb early talkie, excellently restored!","I just saw this excellent restoration of a 1930 talkie from Goldwyn Studios. The black and white camera work is good; even the sound is good! It has been digitally reprocessed for surround sound. Ronald Colman is suave as ever as Raffles, the amateur cracksman. Kay Francis is also charming as Colman's love interest. Colman and Francis would team again two years later in the shamefully neglected film, Cynara (1932). Hopefully, Goldwyn Studios will restore it also. I know some critics might call a movie such as Raffles a trifle dated, but therein lies its charm! Having just seen the new Austin Powers film, it was nice sitting back, relaxing, and watching this chamber drama from another era. Highly recommended! I give it 3 stars only in comparison to some of Colman's other great films."
5,best of the best,Since I'm a woman I don't need to be macho and have the normal type of tape measure! These are so easy to read and fool proof! I'm a kitchen designer and detail is critical. You have to be dead on. These have always been great and I can't find them in stores anymore. I was tickled to find them here. Thanks so much!
4,"love the ""side"" read of this tape","great tape if you use one alot, it will save your neck. literally.the ""side"" read feature is super helpful and the bright blue case makes it easy to find."
5,Quality Lufkin Tape Measure,Very high quality tape measure. The 1 inch wide tape stays taut at greater length than most I have used.
5,Single Parent Loved This Book,"Mommy CEO the Revised Edition is a great book. I think all parents should read this book. It is funny and witty and definitely very helpful to parents. My daughter is now in the Army and reading Jodie Lynn's book brought back so many memories. I also work with parents and youth through ourjustfriends website where we now have a filtered email service of interest to many parents and I will be telling other parents about Mommy CEO.Great BookBob Calvert, Founder..."
1,Didn't Like,I didn't like this book very much. I bought it because of the good reviews (...) A waste.
2,Has a Variety of Answers to Questions about Tots-Teenagers,"I just bought this book due to the recent review that mentions it as ""a toddler book"" under another parenting book I purchased with it called ""The Happiest Toddler on the Block"". I was mislead by that review because this book is NOT focused solely on the toddler years but rather addresses a number of issues relating to tot-teens. It has some helpful information, but because it is so very short, there is not enough in it that meets my needs to warrant the purchase. If you are looking for a general Q and A book from other parents with children of all ages, ""Mommy CEO"" might be a good read for you."
2,Full of common knowledge,"For anyone who has read any books or trade magazines on child raising, this book is full of redundancy. I chose it for more information on ideas for my preschoolers, but there wasn't much availble here. The lesson I learned was to check out the library book first, then buy if I'm truly satisfied. All in all, not very helpful."
5,... Rates Mommy-CEO 5 Stars!,"... I have had the opportunity to review many parenting books, and this is by far my favorite! There's nothing worse than parenting advice from a childless, so-called ""parenting expert"" -- you won't have that problem here! Jodie Lynn shares her real life parenting experiences and also offers advice from other parents -- the REAL experts!Instead of trying to repair behavioral problems, Jodie Lynn suggests you prevent them by teaching your children respect and responsibility at an early age. This advice makes so much sense as opposed to sitting back years down the road and wondering what went wrong. The best part is she doesn't just tell you to teach them, she tells you HOW to teach them by following her ""Five Golden Rules""!Mommy-CEO should be required reading for new parents -- I'm so glad I discovered it while my children are still very young. This book would make an excellent shower gift for the soon-to-be parents!"
1,No Duh! :-( ...Absolutely Nothing New At All,"I found Mommy CEO to be a hodge-podge of about 45 questions with answers I already knew from parents to parents. It includes information from pregnancy and infancy to the teen years. Only about 25 pages of the already very short book (150 pages) were relevant to my needs about my child who is 12. I think moms with younger children may find this book more helpful than I did, although I can not recommend this book in general.Also recommended: I have enjoyed Michelle Borba's books"
3,Good!,"Being an avid Heather Graham fan and a passionate American Civil War historian, I found 'Rebel' slightly disappointing. The opening chapters of the novel definitely displays the typical Heather Graham style of writing, the character reflecting past occurrences leading up to the present. I find it difficult to accept that the two characters, Ian and Alaina, could have fallen in love due to the fact that they were seldom together. Due to Ian's commission with the Union and Alaina's devotion to the Confederacy, the two clashed each time they were together but were cold and distant even during their most intimate moments. 'Rebel' does not include the intrique, the passion, nor the mystery that the more recent contribution to the saga contains. 'Surrender', the more recent of the saga, is far more exiciting! Rebel rates in my opinion a disappointing 3 1/2 stars but one worth once starting, eventually finishing."
2,troubled,"I have read the first 2 books in this series...and loved them....I didnt hate this one but was very dissappointed and troubled.....I loved alaina""s character....was not impressed with risas(Ians first chose of a wife)and was agitated with Ian.....I felt that if he kept thinking of risa he should of let Alaina go....and with friends like risa who needs enemies....and then to have her hook up with Ians cousin in the next book...what the hell is that....heres a clue if ya going to marry be faithful,if not what is good for the goose is good for the wife...."
3,A little dry at first but worth finishing,"A historical romance. The time setting is during the Civil War. It was a little hard to get into the book but excitement picks up as you read. It was not the book that would keep me awake at night, wanting to finish. However, it was worth the time, since there are not many historical romances involving the Civil War era in Florida"
1,Can't sleep at night? This is your book.,"If you're in need of a sleeping pill this is the book for you. I could not get throught one page without going to the land of dreams. While I loved some other of her books this one was wordy and the narrative prose difficult to connect with. I was looking forward to it because the premise was attractive, but the book just didn't deliver. I was glad I picked it up at the library and didn't invest in it. Although, If I find myself counting sheep, I know where to go for deliverance."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I love this item and my baby loves to play in it. It is very durable and it was just a terrific price. I use it for a ball pit rather than a pool and my baby just loves it. The only issue is that my baby is learning to crawl so he climbs out of it sometimes, but thats not an issue because he is in there a while before he wants to get out. I would definitely recommend this for other parents. Although it is more of a baby toy so if your baby is older than 18 months he might be a little big for it =)"
3,"fun and cute, didnt hold up more than a week",I loved this item and spent quite a bit on it. First week we got it my daughter pulled the fish that hangs from the top and the ball pit ripped. i patched with tape but a month later was popped again from the way this ball pit is built.
4,Summer Fun in the Sun,My 7 month old daughter loves this pool. She's constantly splashing and grabbing the cute little toys that come with it. I like the semi-shade thing it has going on too. Good fun.
3,hair gel review,"Please don't be fooled by the organic label here. It has some harmful chemical - I forgot the name, though. But, considering the fact that all of the processed products are harmful directly or indirectly, this is a better option over most of the cheap gels/mousses that we get in stores.My hair didn't get brittle nor leave whitish substance. It's alcohol free so you could go for it. I would advise to do some more research before landing up with this product. There are few good harmless organic gels in the market by audrey organics/ alba botanica.ThanksVijayant Bhatnagar"
2,Doesn't work for me,"Service was fine, but I'm going all natural with my skin & hair care products, and I had great hopes for this mousse, but it's just not for me. I have lots of hair, but it's baby fine and needs some body and hold. This mousse leaves it soft and healthy, but there's absolutely no hold. In fact, I'm not sure I could tell the difference in using it or not using it. I'm not sure what it could be used for; maybe if you have coarse, fizzy hair, it would help, but I'll just have to keep searching. I've been using Sea Kelp Bioferment as a setting gel, and it works pretty darned well."
3,OK product,"I wanted to try a product that had more natural ingredients on my hair than what I was currently using. I saw this and decided to try it out. I'm not way impressed with it like I hoped I would be. It makes my hair feel a lot drier which I can't figure out why looking at the ingredient list. I'd also read a review saying it will last a long time, not so much. I have curly, shoulder length hair, I put on 3-4 pumps a day, I bought the product just over a month ago, and I've already used half the bottle. I'll use up the bottle but won't buy any more again."
1,The Cactus Family,"The Cactus FamilyThis book was a big disappointment to me. I paid the high price because it said it had growing information about the different cacti. In fact, it only had a general growing chapter that gives overall information instead of information for the individual cactus. I needed to know growing information such as light, temperature, moisture, and kind of soil as well as the identity of cactus I have. For a book with this price tag that says it has that information, I expected more than a chapter on general growing conditions that are available anywhere."
4,the complete cactus book,If you want a book that shows more than pictures of cactus then this is the book. It cover enough scentific information to give you enough background information on cactus and follows up with general groups of cactus with pictures to help you understand the diverse range of size and shape that cactus can achieve.Well worth buying and using as a main reference source.
4,Short Stories by Well-known Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers,"Stories include:The Worm by David H. Keller,Mimic by Donald A. Wohlheim,It by Theodore Sturgeon,Beauty and the Beast by Henry Kuttner,Some are Born Cats by Terry and Carol Carr,Full Sun by Brian W. Aldiss,The Silent Colony by Robert Silverberg,The Street that Wasn't There by Clifford D. Simak and Carl Jacobi, andDear Devil by Eric Frank Russell"
2,Great look for a cheap case,"I spent a good ammound of money to get this case. Right away when I received it, it came scratched and missing a few rivits. I still kept the case as it was at the time the only one around. Everyone should know that this case scratchs and dents very easy. In fact that metal I would guess to be 21 GA steel or maybe even thinner. Im guessing it's glued to plastic behind the steel. So it maintains its shape but the scratchs are very noticable. So on to the PROS, I have gotten many compliments on how cool the case looks. In fact I got one last night. If you bring your gear to gigs with lots of on lookers such as jams by yourself then this is the case for you. If you are a traveling music guy such as myself, throwing things in the trailer or back of the truck, this is NOT the case you want. It will be shredded before you even know it."
5,Yummy,I love peanut brittle. I love chocolate. Why not have them together? Why not eat the whole can by yourself? It is that yummy. It is the perfect treat for special occasions
1,Absolutely disappointed,"When I ordered this item, I thought I had bought a tin of fine chocolates. I was completely wrong since this is a sort of peanut brittle covered by a low-quality, tasteless chocolate, not to mention how it looks (irregular, odd-looking pieces). Hershey's chocolates (e.g. kisses, not talking about Dove, which is very good) are much better than these ones. Somebody wrote that this is not sweet; however, my family (sweet tooth) find these sweet enough. We ate just a few; the rest will go to the trash. We cannot add it in homemade ice cream since we think that the chocolate is full of hydrogenated fat."
3,A useful and readable introduction.,"While somewhat dated, Beeler's book is a handy introduction to the medieval art of war. The main drawback to this book is an emphasis on English and French practice and campaigns, though this problem is not unique to Beeler. Not as detailed as Contamine's ""War in the Middle Ages,"" though much more readable."
3,working out to music,I liked this music and would buy more for my aerobics class except that it has silence between songs. I need continuous music with the same up beat tempo to exercise for the entire time.
2,Ok hardware very bad software,"I am very tech savvy, and built my own pc. I installed this into my pc with no problems. The included driver was very outdated and the imon manager is complete crap, I tried to contact the imon software tech support. Unless you speak Korean don't waist your time. The LCD Display did not display anything. I could not get to work but it might have just been me."
5,Great watch!,"This is a fantastic watch! It's very slim, stylish, and it goes with everything. I'm going to get more in different colors! I highly recommend this watch."
4,"Great songs, not so great production","I really enjoyed this album and most of the songs on it, but I didn't like the effect on Paul's voice (he's a good singer, why hide it) and a lot of the songs sounded like I was listening to a demo record, which made little sense. Other than the questionable production quality, this is a great buy for anyone that is into original music or has already heard and liked the band."
2,Partially downloaded,"The download of the book, partially trunk the pages, not allowing its complete reading. Considering that this is an already complex book to read, it made the experience complicated."
5,excellent book,I totally recommend this book for those who wants to be a professor. This is a very special book because it is a legend so I totally recommend it to you. I am really glad that I bought this book because I found a message inside the book that I really appreciated it. Thank you
2,Poor: many half-cut paragraphs.,"Poor: many half-cut paragraphs. HTML formatting very rough. Fine for free but not for sale, so the saving claimed by Amazon is dubious."
3,Lo deje de leer,Lastimosamente deje de leer este libro ya que no se veia bien en mi celular (Galaxy Ace) el formato hacia que se ve de esta formaTexto Texto Texto Texto Texto Texto Texto TextoTexto TextoTexto Texto Texto Texto Texto Texto Texto TextoTexto TextoTexto Texto Texto Texto Texto Texto Texto TextoTexto TextoTexto Texto Texto Texto Texto Texto Texto TextoTexto TextoCOmo ven en mi ejemplo aparecia una linea de texto y de hay se saltaba a la siguiente en donde solo aparecian dos o tres palabras la verdad es demasiado incomodo leer asi.
4,This is a very good edition.,"This Spanish edition includes footnotes in every page explaining the archaic words. Without them, the book is not readable. I had bought another edition and could not understand many sentences. The footnotes explain places, names, and provide commentary on consistency errors that the text has.I decided to read the book on its 400th anniversary. I had tried before when I was fifteen, but did not get to page 100. I have finished the first book, and I'm in the process of reading the second one.As some have noted, some insights of Don Quijote are still modern. He talks, for instance, about the way that people that go to college are better paid than soldiers, when soldiers risk their lives and health. Also, about how entertainment is vulgar because the masses likes it that way (hence the term, from vulgo), and other subjects that remain current.I am going to finish the book, but it takes effort. I have been reading for two months, reading other books in between."
4,Why no region 1 DVD? And why the high price?,For a movie that most people don't know about the way this one is priced you'd think it was the rarest gem in the world. I suppose it's the old supply and demand theory at work here - if there was more demand the price would go down eh? Well I thought this movie was great. I loved the whole deal with the necklace - how she makes the other woman look like a gold-digger and then ends up eating her own words when she finally steals him away and he gets her the bargain basement version she'd acted like she'd like before. I'm waiting for a DVD and a reasonable price - but the movie is wonderful.
5,Rediscovery of an old friend,"In college in the early '60s I had a jazz show amd fell in love with Twardzik's quirky, almost Monk-like playing. In the years since I'd lost the vinyl copy of Trio, so getting the CD was like discovering a long-lost friend. Twardzik is as great as my memory had him, but what I'd not paid attention to at the time was Russ Freeman's work on the album. This is swinging, West Coast jazz at it's best, and Freeman has some of the same almost atonal approaches to playing as Twardzik. And the real kicker here is that on the original vinyl he had 6 cuts. On the CD he has 14. I recommend this CD strongly.Sadly, other than a few cuts on Baker's Paris recordings of 1956 and his album, 'Chet Baker in Europe', which I've not been able to locate anywhere, Twardzik has not left much of his unique piano work for us. A heroin overdose while touring with Baker in Europe cut short his brilliance when he was 25. So invest a bit and capture for yourself his unique sound."
5,Vaccines can trigger autism,"My son became autistic at the age of 12 months immediately following the MMR vaccine. Vaccine-induced autism can be avoided simply by using vaccines that do not contain mercury, & by breaking up the vaccine load--give the M, then the M, then the R, not all at once. Remember, anything the disease can do to your child, the vaccine can do to your child. That said, there will be no outbreak of disease if the majority continues to be vaccinated. Just avoid vaccines if your child is immune deficient or if you have a family history of autism or other neurological disabilities. Bernard Rimland is the foremost expert on autism & savior of autistic children in the US. Ignore the ignorant first reviewer, & read everything of Rimland's that you can get your hands on."
4,another rebuttal to the uninformed,"Yes, genes can play a role in autism, but the exact causes of autism are yet unknown, and seem to be many. There's no reason parents should feel any guilt about having a child with autism because it is NOT their fault. The time of parent blaming should be long over, it's sad that it still exists at all. Even if genes were the sole cause of the disorder, do you really think parents should be blamed for this!? Try informing yourself about autism instead of bashing parents and authors that are trying to help these children. There seems to be a lot of supporting evidence for the vaccine/autism link."
3,Pretty much the same information,"This book was a little disappointing to me. I have so many vaccine books, including one by the same author, which is great, but this one pretty much had the same information as the other books I have. It does go into autism a little more. If you are just beginning to investigate the risks of vaccines, or want more information on autism, than this is a good book to read. If you are well into your research, I wouldn't waste your money."
5,You need this book.,"Are you a man?Is there something you always wanted to do but were afraid to?You need this book.It's brilliant... a self help book writen for men in straight, no noncence man talk.I have bought 5 or 6 copies of this book and always give them away to people I meet...and it makes me feel good!"
5,It Gave Me the Strength To Save My Sanity,"I first read this very straight forward, helpful book more than seventeen years ago, when I knew I had to leave my marriage in order to save my sanity and be an effective parent to my children, ages 17 and 13. The information contained in Learning To Leave, finally gave me the courage to do what was necessary to end the emotional abuse we lived with on a daily basis. This book was my guide, my strength, my power, when I felt very weak and afraid. Even after my divorce, it's messages have remained with me and enriched other areas of my life. This book is a must for anyone contemplating leaving a relationship. Read it, even if you have to do so under cover. It just may save your life!"
1,New Title,"As a victim of divorce and reviewer of this book, I believe a better title would be ""Learning to Deceive""."
4,"Highly original composition, excellent guitar and vocals.","I first heard ""Coconut Milk"" recently on my local NPR station, and immediately logged into Amazon.com to buy the CD. Linda Waterfall is an excellent and original writer, and has a beautiful voice. I loved the guitar work on the album so much, I was eager to see who she'd hired to back her up, and was amazed when I realized that she did the guitar as well. She's a really first-rate guitarist in addition to being a wonderful singer."
3,Highly Over Rated,"Pascale et.al. dust off the same tired case studies that have been chewed to mush in business publications for years and attempt to give them a new spin. If baseline for information on chaos and complexity theory is the business press, actual new content is negligible in this highly over rated book. For executives who don't have time to stay current, reading this loose collection of anecdotes is not the easiest nor the most interesting method of becoming informed on this engaging topic. And if you are looking for a toolkit, this is not the book for you."
2,Can't see the use,"I read this kind of books hoping to find useful ideas for my business. Here I can't find any.Even if one is just curious, the book is too full of platitudes. For instance, the Army chapter (in which I was genuinely interested) waxes high on gruelling experience, after-action review, and all that. But what's the big deal? Mutatis mutandis, I did the same in sports training twenty years ago.PS: I think I got unhelpful votes from people disliking my Army comments, so I edited this review to better reflect what I mean. But let me make it clear: independent of any view of the military, this is a bad book."
1,Surfing the edge of boredom.,"I love chaos. It's such a promising concept. Tom Peters presents a much more exciting presentation of the kind of information this book covers. Something tells me that this book is really just a public relations document for the authors. They just want to give themselves a little bit more credibility. While most management books probably have that aim this book just stinks with it.Are we really supposed to believe that the case studies they provide are inspiring? US Army? Tupperware?I usually read this kind of book in the bathroom. I started to neglect my natural process because ""that book"" was sitting in there.I came away with nothing new about chaos theory. I learned even less about how it can be used by business - especially my small business."
2,These beans are different...,"I bought my son a set of these Pokemon beans to go with his race tracks, and I found out that the Pokemon beans are lighter than the beans that come with the race track and won't go down. Not sure what else to do with them if they won't work on the tracks... And one of the beans has already torn around the middle and is threatening to come apart, and I've had it one day."
5,beanz,"do you like pokemon?if yes you might like this toy. thair is 58 of pokemon beanz.19 commons,19 rares and 19 ultra rare."
5,A Rollercoaster,I loved this book!!!!!It was fast-paced and a great read. The characters are unique and provocative. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to get lost in a great book and who loves a good twist. Think Sixth Sense
1,Confusing at best,"For someone who never used drugs, this book is incomprehensible. It may make sense to those who have--and perhaps the author was on a trip when he wrote it.Suffice it to say that the protagonist's drug-induced revelations about his father, cameras, abduction victims, South America, refrigerators, lakes and all seemed unconnected. It was one of those rare mysteries that I abandoned at the 230-page point, unable to find a reason to continue."
4,tried and true,"Most comfortable wrap I've found for my male dogs that like to mark their territory in the house. It's flexible, not too thick and easily washed. For the absorbent part, I use a regular human baby diaper (size 2-3), turn it long ways, fold the elastic edges back on themselves (to make a long rectangular strip out of the diaper) and then wrap that around the dog's abdomen, securing it with the diaper tabs)--the dog wrap provides extra security and also ""hides"" the diaper so it's not so obvious.In terms of sizing, dimensions of the wrap are listed on the amazon site, which is helpful. I purchased a ""small"" for my 12 lb chihuahua, who measures about 17 1/2 inches around. Bear in mind that the length is the MAX length of the wrap, so there is a several inch span of velcro to allow for adjusting. If your little boy measures 17-18"" around, it will be pretty snug with the majority of velcro exposed, so you may want to consider going up to the medium."
5,Punch! Your ride,Awesome sound! I am not a loud music type of person and was thinking I was a bit too much when I acquired the speakers. Alas no! This is one modest investment that is a treat to my experience in the car audio. The clarity of sound is incredible and what's astounding is it perfoms even well in the low volumes making my time in the car really entertaining!
4,Harlem on the Bayou,"I get the feeling that these guys are still giving free concerts somewhere deep in NYC. This is an incredible, raw sound coming from Mr. Satan (a one man band in his own right) and Adam on harmonica. This is a must for any hard core blues junkie. Hey Adam,no offense, but leave the vocals to your partner or learn to growl!"
3,A little too simple,"This book is a little too short for the vast amount of bugs that actually exist here; only 125 bugs in this book. It has cute drawings of each bug it describes, but half of the actual photographs are of people. I am sure this is a great book for casual curiosity, but I found it a little disappointing."
3,Mediocre,"First thing: if you are a Therion fan this is before they had their major sound change and started incorporating classical music into their sound and was before their first big commercially successful album (Theli). A LOT of Therion fans do not care much for their pre-Theli work. I sometimes listen to a few of the songs like Symphony of the Dead which isn't bad and was also played on the Live in Midgard album (2001). The other bad news is that there is nothing really new or original, even though at the time Therion was experimenting with some keyboards and electronic elements in metal before it became popular.On the good side, none of the songs on the album are ""bad"". They are all decent metal songs. And the album is decent and heavy"
1,This is a $3 cable,"There is no such thing as ""Playstation 3"" Ethernet cable. This is simply a lie. Any Ethernet cable will work perfectly with the Playstation 3, and they cost about $3 (not $12). Don't get ripped off. Buy a standard Ethernet cable in the length that you need (or just use the Wi-Fi connection on the Playstation 3)."
1,My revire,It's A GOOD ITEM.But it turns out that I really didn't need it after all.I wish some one would have told me that all I needed to go online with my PS3 was a wireless connection.That would have saved me some money.
2,"not the best of these megapack releases , but some good ones here",i own most of these megapacks collections and like them but this set just didn't grab me the way some did.some of the shows were good but most were in poor shape picture wise and some of the shows were not very good quality(meaning writing and acting). some may like it but this collection just left me cold.
4,Ah! To relive the old days of TV.,"Years ago I watched an old episode of Rin-Tin-Tin and couldn't believe I ever watched the show. Since then I have seen old episodes of other shows and have delighted in them. This selection is very good, giving you 6 episodes of different old shows. I haven't seen them all yet, but so far I have been entertained by the performances of Joan Fontaine, Dick Powell, David Niven and many other great stars that are gone. One wish I have and I know it's strange is that I wish they had left in the commercials. I am sorta nostalgic for them also. It is also interesting to note that the production values were extremely low but this only enhances the quality of the performances, whereas today it is all whizbang and little character development on many shows."
3,TV megapack.,"Not some of the better episodes and defintly not a ""best of"" but some are good and some are very bad"
3,It's as good as the source material allows,"The Cars, to me, were a band that never quite hit their stride. They show flashes of brilliance, and have left us with some wonderful songs, but they never delivered consistently. For every ""You're All I've Got Tonight"", there's two or three ""Who's Gonna Drive You Home""s.This compilation suffers from that inconsistency. The better songs are a treat, but decent versions of mediocre songs can't transcend mediocrity. I enjoy this disc, but I find myself fast-forwarding over half the tracks.One highlight is the laid back closer ""Let The Good Times Roll"" that infuses the track with a melancholy reminiscent of The Jazz Butcher's ""Party Time"".Also, why is no one covering ""Cruiser""???"
4,Another great one from Troma,"This is about the supposed lost barrel of toxic waste from the late 80's the government found unaccounted for. Well a bunch of hilarious inbred good ol' boys find the barrel o fun and make some magical green moonshine out of it in there still out in the woods. Some campers get attacked by redneck zombies that drank the 'shine. It does look like it was filmed with a camcorder, but it doesn't take away from the hilariously gory FX, like the transition from a dead redneck to a zombie. If you hate rednecks, buy it. There's plenty of dead ones. Lot's of off-color humor and some bad acting round off the film. There's a very funny parody of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre scene with the hitchhiker. The enormously fat redneck is hilarious and partakes in a zombie rape scene that's so absolutely disgusting it is side splitting funny. It's easily the goriest movie I've seen and is a funny, artsy masterpiece."
3,low buDget with a capital D,"Gory once you pass the boredom. Hillbilly hicks drink their green juice,go on a lysergics trip, then turn inside out, become zombies. Ugly actors, but pretty good for a low budget film. It's from TROMA TEAM, who else? Don't let the box cover fool ya. That lady's not in the film."
1,really bad,I wonder who would give this 'movie' anything above 1 star--- teenage boys pulling a prank?? Don't watch this waste of a movie!!!
2,"So Bad, its, well, Bad!","Not funny. There is no aesthetic to this movie at all. Some of the gore is okay, but so what? This is one hell of a lame movie. I like camp, but this thing is so self-conscious, so sophomoric, so amatuer, it will have you cringing and then just drifting. It sounds like it was written by a fifth grader. The ""acting"" is moronic. Once again, not funny. I'm sorry, but the people that said this movie is funny were extremely messed up when they saw this.If you want to see a good troma release, try Terror Firmer, Tromeo and Juliet, Toxic Avenger, Killer Condom, Cannibal the Musical, or even Kabuki Man. Don't waste your time with this. You'll be sorry."
1,i dont get it,"I heard a lot of good things about this movie, but i thought it s u c k e d ! it was way too corny, and boring. for horror comedy seek movies like evil dead 2, and dead alive"
4,Low Quality Direct To Video Gem!,"While the quality of this film may scare some viewers off at first, rest assured it gets pretty good throughout the film.The film is at it's best when it is following their stereotypical characters and becomes outright hilarious!I was in tears laughing during the autopsy scene in this film. I though I was going to die laughing!If you keep your eyes open for specific things each character does throughout the film, if makes it all the more funny! For example, there is one character who never talks, but always has a bottle of alcohol to drink from in every single scene of the movie.Released by Troma, but not made by the Troma team, Redneck Zombie is a pretty funny gore-comedy. Don't take it as anything else and you'll love it!"
5,All I gotta say is AWESOME,"Alright, if you are a big time cheesy horror flick fan like I am, you will like this one. Not only is the movie HILARIOUS, the extras on the DVD are something else. If youre in for a good laugh and can stand a little gore, then this movie is definitely for you."
3,STUPID FUN WITH A COUPLE OF WEIRD SPOOKY TWISTS !,"REDNECK ZOMBIES is a harmless but demented ultra low-budget cult classic !GORE-FEST! Its definetely not for everyone but i enjoyed it plenty! This is one of those ""ITS SO STUPID ITS FUNNY"" kinda movies. Great fun!"
2,Redneck...,This movie is the sorriest thing I have ever seen. It looks like somebody bought a home video camera and filmed it in their backyard. The acting was so terrible that it was funny. If you want to see the worst movie ever watch this film.
1,Horrible acting. Shot on video. Total cr*p.,"I'm a major movie buff, and the movies I enjoy most are cheesy comedies and stuff... but this is the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. I had to turn it off in the middle, it was complete sh!te. It is shot on video in incredibly poor quality, the makeup effects are incredibly primitive, the directing is awful, the acting is abysmal, and the writing is some of the worst, most obvious and most stupidly stereotypical I have ever run across. Don't even try to watch this movie, much less waste money buying it. If I could give it zero stars or negative stars, I would. Heed my warning!"
2,Zombie Flick,Troma handles this lame zombie flick about when hillbilies turn chemical waste into a whisky still they turn into zombies. The acting was bad. I found it Wal Mart for 5 bucks. Wouldn't recommend it.
2,A troma fan,"I love most all Troma movies SGT. KABUKIMAN N.Y.B.D., TOXIC ADVENGER, TROMEO AND JULIET, TEENAGE CAT GIRLS IN HEAT....to name a few and REDNECK ZOMBIES wasn't Tromas best it really kinda sucked. It was disapointing to watch it was so bad I had to shut it off half way through...the only reason it got 2 stars instead of 0 stars is because its a Troma Film."
2,Now this is a Bad Film,"All the elitist critics who half watch a perfectly good film only to rip it apart, (Ebert & Roeper I am talking to you) should be forced clockwork orange style to sit through this. This is the real deal when it comes to an unwatchably bad, embarrasingly awful film.Friendly Warning: This isn't campy fun, voiceover audience participation bad-just bad. Seriously don't waste your time or money."
3,Good party movie,"This is a b movie that most people would probably think they've been ripped off after buying it. It starts off pretty slow. The scene with the tobacco man is way too long. About 20 minutes into the film it starts getting really good. There's a lot of blood, guts, gore, and slapstick humor. They way this movie makes fun of rednecks is absolutely hilarious. Watch for the very funny scene when, while in the cave, the medical student is trying to do an autopsy while on acid. Once you pass the cave scene and most of the cast is killed, the last 20 minutes with the one girl left are pretty boring. At that point, you'll be ready for the movie to be over, but she has to kill all the remaining zombies. It takes too long and gets annoying. But the middle hour of the movie is great. I think everyone should see this movie at least once either to see the blood and gore, or for the redneck humor. Or both."
3,COOL GORE,"I ONLY LIKED THE EFX IN THIS MOVIE,ACTING WAS HORID,DIALOG WAS BORING AND FORCED,THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED THIS MOVIE WAS THE COOL GORE EFX,IF IT WASNT FOR THAT IT WOULD HAVE BLOWN GOATS."
5,WALK AWAY LAUGHING AND DISTURBED,"A fun and quarky film. If you've seen the mainstream (as close as it can be) zombie movies, then it's time to move up to this gem. Great if you live in the country. It takes the use of rural people in zombie movies (Night of the Living Dead) and plays with it.Do not be fooled. This film is horrifying. The acting is weak, but that's to be expected. If I see a horror film with good acting, I get worried. This is good and gory. The ending is one of the best I've seen in a horror film. I laughed as many times as I grimaced. ""Redneck Zombies"" is a legend amoung my peers.Fair warning, as the cover illustrates, it is not kind to women at all, and this movie looks for buttons to push."
3,Watchable,"I'm sure the production cast and everyone involved in creating this film had a bit more of a better time than viewers. It appears to be shot with a camcorder, something or other. This movie has it's moments. If you are a fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you're in for a treat because there is parody of the hitchhiker scene- I almost busted a gut all over myself. If you are seriosuly thinking of buying this movie just for the fact that it is a TROMA RELEASE(not actually filmed in Tromaville, just distributed by them), may I suggest to check out the more recent Tromeo and Juliet or Class of Nuke'em High. Those are the only worthy of recomendation that I have viewed."
4,CRAZY SCENES,ACTUALY I WAS IN THE MOVIE AND I KNOW THE DIRECTOR THAT MADE THE MOVIE. MY ROLE WAS A FILL IN ZOMBIE THAT WAS EATING THE FLESH OF THESE CRAZED HUMANS THAT CAME ON OUR FARM THAT WE WERE MAKING MOON SHINEOVER ALL THIS MOVIE WAS RATED AS A B RATED MOVIE LOW BUDGET AND EVERYONE DID A FINE JOB IN MAKUP TO SET THE STAGE WHERE THE SCENES WERE FILMED
1,REDNECK ZOMBIES - THE DIRECTOR'S CUT DVD REVIEW:,"Obviously this movie is crap, what do you expect? I knew before watching this movie it was going to be s##t. This type of movie is suppose to be funny even though it is listed under the horror category in your local video store.FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN WATCHING THIS MOVIE, GET REALLY HIGH OR DO SOME KIND OF DRUG BEFORE YOU WATCH IT."
1,Zombie X,Ok ill keep this short dont buy this peice of crap go and spend your hard earnd money on 13 $1.00 hookers. The herpes you contract is fare more pleasant than this hunk of dirt farming inbred trailer park trash movie.
5,The movie is as bad (good) as the title!!!,"This is one of the funniest movies evermade, it is also incredibly gory. I don'tknow what the other viewers were expecting when they watched this fantastically horrible piece of garbage but if you go in watching with incredibly low expectations, like I did, you will be very happy. This movie is best viewed with a like minded friend so that someone is there to laugh when you make a third rate MST3K comment. If you like anything from Troma you must buy this movie."
4,What no commentary??,"Well I would normally have given this disk a 3 out of 5 since there was no making of supplements, but given the nature of the film and how it was made (on spare weekends with buddies and their camcorder) It's a given that there wouldn't be any behind the scenes footage to provide. My frustration does lie with the fact that it is a full price disc that doesn't even have a commentary track. (Don't be fooled. review with thedescription for the disc, while it does look like a typo, lists it as having a commentary)It has a dozen or so Troma trailers, but then we've seen them allready on their other discs. The movie does look great though. A great addition to the collection of a zombie fan like myself!"
5,Moonshiners turn into zombies following a toxic spill.,This was the funniest movie I have ever seen! It looks as if it was filmed with a personal camcorder. The actors in the film seem to have to double up on parts because after some are killed you see them again as other characters. If you are like my friends and I who love to find movies that are SO BAD that they are good- then Redneck Zombies is for you!
1,WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO BROOKS?,"I generally enjoy Helen Brooks' work, but lately her books have taken a turn for the worse. I really liked her books - Price of a Wife, A Private Revenge and The Bride Wore Black. Her other books were passable, but this one was just plain awful. Too much emotional baggage on both sides and not much chemistry between the characters. I hope that her books pick up soon."
4,I like,"* This book has provided preliminary introduction to the platform with exploringthe technical underpinnings of the Mac OS X Java implementation.* This booke is good for new java developer for Mac OS X platform, someone can explore thepragmatics of Java development, including how to set up your development environment.* And makes you aware of Apple's various additons to the java platform and describes howto package and deliver an application to end users that looks and behaves like a naiveMac OS X application.* It has covers some recent features like Web start, Speech framework, Web service andEjb and Jboss.* After that this book is good start for getting hands on the Apache web server running andsupplement it with the jakarta Tomcat JSP and servlet containers."
4,Fills it's niche,"This is more of a set of self-contained articles than a book. Though it is not specifically written that way. I'm mixed about why this book was necessary. The topics are a hodge-podge. Which leads me to the 'set of articles' notion.That being said, overall the writing is good and the topics are fairly well covered. Chapter three, on tools, is a standout. There are some problems, the code isn't well annotated, and some chapters, like chapter 9 on Speech, feel out of place altogether.For those looking to make use of some OS X specific features with Java, you will like this book. It's pretty specific though, so for the casual reader I would recommend against it."
3,Okay book,I would recommend reading this on top of other nursing informatics books out there. Unfortunately for some beginners like myself (with no qualification) it's not very engaging and find it slightly too 'geeky' for me to understand. I would use it for quick reference but not something you use to study upon.
2,Repetitive,"This was required reading for a doctoral course. I have an interest in informatics; nevertheless, I found the book repetitive and uninteresting. Almost every chapter waxes on about the merits of forming committees to investigate choices, involving the end-point users etc. This only needs to be said once, not in every single chapter. The book could be a 1/3d of its size without all the repetition. There are better, more concise books on the topic, I'm sure."
3,Nice,"It's useful on my boat, but please note that you have to focus each eyepiece SEPARATELY. Otherwise, works well."
1,no distance focus,"The paperwork included in this package shows a center distance focus.It says to focus left eye, then right eye and then use center knob to focus for distance.There Is not center knob to focus."
4,BEST BOOK ON THE MARKET ON JONBENET AND IT CAN'T BE FOUND!,"I was quite disappointed not to be able to find this book on the shelves...I had heard about it on the radio and finally was able to order it through Amazon Books...Quite the book! I agree with the Burke theory but mostly was appauled to read about the Kiddie Pageants. My heart went out to the Director in the story..such a hard life and still sees a life ahead of her. She needs to travel the circuit to tell her story. Like Marilyn Vandenberg, she has a most interesting story to tell and to hopefully save other children like JonBenet Ramsey...I believe that someone in that house knew that JonBenet was being molested....and were afraid to tell. I can see how the director in the book and JonBenet could be related..they were both show pieces...This book needs to get into the public domain...the real world and truths are what you are going to read here...."
2,Very poorly written,"This is, doubtlessly, one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. It is apparent to me that the author threw the book together as the funding started to dry up. The theory posed in the book was interesting, but precious little facts and evidence are given to support it. It is pure speculation at best, and poorly written speculation at that."
1,Poorly written,"This book was complete speculation and not covered by facts. Being involved in the pageant industry for years I am very disappointed in this book.The Ramseys were never even connected with her pageants so how can she give the information she has?The author can be a tribute for what not to do in Kiddie pageants, but realize her books will all be fairy tales."
3,I Want t To Read More About Pageants!!,A little disappointed in not to be able to read more about the beauty pageant industry. The woman in the book needs to write one just on the industry alone. We've all heard about JonBenet...ENOUGH!!! Give us the real scoop on the pageants!
3,KIDDIE PAGEANTS REVEALED!!,I think everyone will understand why this little girl was murdered. She was dressed to portray a miniature adult in adult clothing...at a hefty PRICE TAG! I was amazed at what these parents pay for fame!!!!
4,Jonbenet and Pageant Director have alot in common,"I never wanted to believe that Jonbenet possibly could have been murdered because of her participating in pageants. Now I'm not so sure. Duct taping, breast implants on 12 year olds, false hair pieces, sexy modeling, and flaunting the little girl all makes sence! Wouldn't that turn on a little boy? Especially if she was getting all the attention and him not? The pageant director and JonBenet have alot in common, the only difference is that one lived, the other didn't. I wonder if JonBenet ever told her mother. I feel this child has been sexually abused for a long time. I have always wanted to enter my little girl in a pageant, now I'm not so sure. If a little girl is pretty, why can't she just win in a simple little party dress? It sounds to me that you have to have the Ramsey money to participate in these so called events!"
5,PAGEANT DIRECTOR KNOWS MORE!!!,The pageant directors life story made me cry...but i'll bet SHE KNOWS MORE!! PLEASE WRITE A BOOK JUST on the pageant industry...very intriguing i'm sure!! (couldn't find the book..read a friend's)
2,Lotsa spelling and some factual goofs!,"I was basically disappointed with this book. Anyone who has been following the JonBenet case closely will pick up immediately on the many name mispellings and other errors. The book needs a much better editing job. It appeared to me that its authors and publishers tried too hard to get it out too fast. The book does, however, make one ponder the authors' theory about the case. Better books on this case will be forthcoming, I am sure."
3,THEORY ONE TO THINK ABOUT,"The theory in the book leaves us with a wild imagination. Better written, it would have been one of the best books out there. At least it was a theory to think about, not one that everyone else has come up with. All the others have come up with the same thing...NOTHING! The same thing with all the TV interviews and tabloid articles..NOTHING! I would like to read more about the Children Beauty Pageants. I bought this book hoping to read about it."
5,PAGEANT DIRECTOR...CLASSY LADY!!!,"I first met this pageant director in Cherry Hills New Jersey many years back...what a classy woman! It was so heart warming to see her caring for her ""Colorado Kids"" the way she did! Other States were always so envious of the way she treated her National contestants...OUR Director would never give us the time of day once we got to the national finals! OUR State Director was just interested in the big bucks she was making! We were classified as just another number! The horror stories to be told about these so called pageants are numerous...I wished this Colorado Director would write a book just on this...I KNOW if anyone has the INSIDE story...SHE does! AND her story was something else..YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN!!! Goes to show you...you NEVER know what goes on behind closed doors....rich, middle class, or poor.....NO MORE JONBENET stories...LET US READ THE REAL TRUTH!!"
4,COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN! WORTH THE WAIT!,"Such a sad and touching story about the woman in the book. I don't think JonBenet's Pageant experiences were a few Sundays only! And I think the Pageant had something do with this little girls murder! She was sexually exploited and after reading how these mothers react and act, I'm almost positive! People need to read this book and see the shocking results! I cannot believe a book like this is not readily available to the public. Why was it written?? I have read the other two...no comparrison! FINALLY we know the truth on why this little girl has become so famous...before this, noone knew who she was...now the whole world does!! END"
4,Too Bad This Wasn't A Story on Beauty Pageants!,I was certainly disappointed that this whole book wasn't on the beauty pageant industry. I hope that Eleanor VonDuyke does write one on the industry. I feel that Jonbenet books are growing into nothing! The same thing is being printed...everything you read in the Tabloids or newspapers! I think that if the right writer gets ahold of this woman there will be alot to be told. This book is no where to be found. i ran into it accidently on the internet. Why? It definitely is one of the better Jonbenet books out there...at least the Director's story is SOMETHING new!!
1,to small and hard plastic,Doesn't conform to your face and uv light enters in from the sides putting your eyes at risk. . Very disatisfied with this product.
3,Lacking,"It's hard to mess up tanning googles, my only complaint is they don't come with the elastic band. My gym only had stand up beds do I have to squint to keep them on."
2,"Good for the price, uncomfortable though","I'm a guy and got pink but oh well, it does say random color. They work fine for blocking out the tanning rays, my only complaint is that the bridge of the nose isn't very comfortable. Perhaps after more use the plastic on the nose will soften a bit.Update: I downgraded my review by two stars. I have used these goggles numerous times, and no matter what I do or how I wear these goggles, they are very uncomfortable for me across the bridge of my nose."
3,von Däniken has done it again,"This book is another great book by the master. If you have some background knowledge of Greek mythology, this will only make the content better. I found it to be a good book, but unfortunately it is not one of his best books. I have read 3/4 of all his books and this book is therefor not as great as the others, but not far from it. Don't take my word for it, or anyone elses for that matter. Read it and then decide for your self. We who write these reviews are only saying what we think. What you think is up to you. So read it, and then write what you thought about the book."
3,Just a little disappointed,"This book is about Greek myths connected to E.T's. Greek mythology probably came from an older source, but you still learn something new in each of his books."
1,Atlantis,"Three points about Von Daniken's arguments: 1. Atlantis is simply a literary device of Plato's which serves as a background in which to expound his philosphy. 2. The Pillars of Hercules are on the mainland of Greece; my reference is ""The Pelopennesian War"" by Donald Kagan .The Peloponnesian War. 3. By sailing past the Pillars of Hercules, you are in the Mediterranean, not the Atlantic. This puts Santorini and Crete right in the center of the bullseye for possible origins of Plato's Atlantis."
2,"Pretty outside, lacking on the interior","The box initally comes across very nice, rich black leather look but the inside is lacking the quality one would expect for paying this amount of money for this display case. The pouches that hold the watch are made cheaply and covered with very cheap material, hard on the sides. One would expect to have at least soft cushions to be encased by your collections, not a cheap cloth, if that is what it is, material. Would not buy if I had seen the interior. Bottom drawer is made of flimsy materail with smaller cushions than on top, don't know why but the cushions are not interchangable."
2,Cheap looking,"i bought this as a gift and expected leather, well because the ad says its leather. its smells of plastic and is definitly not real leather. i was very dissapointed in the look and feel of this box. the interior is very poorly made-cardboard and faux suede (im giving them to much credit here) glued together. i would not recomend buying this product if you want quality. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is its a decent price but NOT what is advertised. buyer beware."
5,Very sophisticated,Got this for my hubby for xmas and he LOVED it. The box is very well built and looks super classy. No complaints def. worth the money it is a great piece you will have forever.
3,Good gift for watch collectors.,"I bought this watch case for my brother who is a watch collector and he loved it. He has 20+ watches stored in different boxes so now he can put most of them in one place. I'm not sure if most of his large-faced watches will fit, but the case seems to be well-crafted and sturdy. I only gave 3 stars because I can't really say whether it fits all types of watches."
5,great case,"this is the case I was expecting find out, really usefull and beautifull and I keep organized my watches. Very neat"
3,Awesome box - but USED,"The item came, and looks like it's a good quality box, but it was definitely used. Some of the pillows were dirty, and the exterior of the box had scratches and scuffs, and even warping. (Nothing a trip to Michaels, and some creativity can't fix). I guess - all is fair in online shopping, and you get what you pay for, despite it being advertised as new."
5,Watch Box,"I purchased this box for my husband, its beautiful!The only disappointment I had was the key/lock function does not work.I wanted to return it for a replacement and I was only offered a refund."
3,My introduction to Hawkwind,I picked up this disk after hearing some good things about Hawkwind over the years. I am not an expert on the band but to me I really like the first disk of this set but found the other two disks pretty tedious. If you are interested in this band you might be better off getting their best albulms in their entirety.
3,Three of these four are available elsewhere in real stereo.,"Decca/London was experimenting with stereo recordings of complete operas as early as 1954. The three Italian operas recorded in Vienna were done in real stereo, and are available elsewhere in that format. These transfers are of the mono mixes recorded at the same time. Only the DG Flute is mono-only.All of these performances are first class, and far different from any Mozart you are going to hear 50+ years later. If stereo is unimportant to you, by all means, buy, learn and enjoy."
2,CRAP,very cheeset cheap money making trinket that is not that fun! I hated it and should have thrown my money in street!
1,"Some people love it, some people hate it ...","My girlfriend saw this play and said it was hilarious. Maybe seeing it makes all the difference.Reading it was a nightmare. It's impossible to explain, but if you're curious, buy it and see for yourself.I threw it out."
4,Looking forward to directing this....,I hadn't read anything else by this author and I wasn't sure what to make of the descriptions I read but after receiving the play and giving it a read I knew I was going to want to direct or be in this show. It does read a little clunky at times and it feels as though the speaking traits of a couple of the characters may wear thin but that doesn't happen. I'd suggest getting some friends together and having a read through. That's what we did and we had a blast. The story is complex but not very deep. I can't say that this is a show that will answer any questions of the universe for you but I bet you will enjoy the ride.
4,"Clay, noo-noo dish is gooey.","This is a fun play, with several very creative and funny components that keep this from being a standard series of ""ah ha's"". Definitely a fun night at the theatre and also a fun read. Without giving anything away, this is about a woman whose life is skewed and the necessary occurances that bring it back into perspective for her, and us too. Featuring an imposter-brother, a foul-mouthed pot-smoking kid, an almost-schizophrenic husband, a tongue-tied stroke-victim grandma, and a not-too-bright schizophrenic puppeteer-kidnapper. Yes, all of them and more make Fuddy Meers a good, creative, enjoyable time."
5,Great Product and Service,Received my order today in perfect condition and it arrived earlier than expected. GREAT Job Amazon! Thank you for yet another problem-free order.
4,Great for everyday use,This set is perfect for everyday use. Good quality and not expensive. Corel is always a good choice.
5,Very Happy,"I am very happy with my purchse. I was especially glad to be able to get glasses with the sets rather than coffee cups, as we would never use them."
5,Corelle set with glassware,The set of dishes is great and totally unbreakable. We have dropped them many times. This set is nice becuase it includes 4 drinking glasses rather than the mugs
4,"""Good to Go""","As a wife of one the members of the TRAP mission it was great to finally read something about the men that risked their lives to save Capt. O'Grady. America views O'Grady as a hero, when in truth the Marines are the heros. Imagine, for a moment reading all of the quotes, from the men and not just reading a meaningless name, but actually remembering BBQs, nights out together, and watching their children grow before your eyes. This book gave an insight on the men. Everyone knows everything about O'Grady, but what do you know about the men that made it possible for him to live?As a footnote: my husband (in the book Cpl Lindsey--he has continued his faithful service and has been promoted)doesn't not share my sentiments. He sees it as a job--that's what he is paid to do. He doesn't even like talking about it.I am proud that names were put to the other key players in this story!"
2,Not neccessarily a Good To Go book,"This is a well researched book, but it is slow moving and got very boring at times. If you want to read the story from the folks who planned and executed the mission this is the book that tells their side, but it lacks a certain excitement. Capt O'Grady is quoted only a few times. I was surprised that certain mistakes made during the planning and execution of the rescue were disclosed."
1,"'Good to Go' : The Rescue of Capt. Scott O'Grady, Usaf, from",Embelished. Know inside story. Should NEVER have been shot down in the first place. Laundry list of errors on ground starting with basic rescue procedures.
5,New OS 10.4 Tiger Rocks!,"I got my powerbook just last week and I thought I had to upgrade with Mac.com from OS 10.3 to 10.4. But surprisingly, it came with 10.4 Tiger in the machine already. The only thing makes me nervous is the battery gets really hot after awhile. It actually burns my laps. I did check with the serial numbers on Mac.com to see if mine is one of those defected batteries, but it is not. Am wonder if any users out there are experiencing the same 'heat' issue?"
4,"Great, except that pulsating light","It runs really fast, the Web cam is pretty spiffy, nice lighting, keyboard. I love the power plug that magnetic, probably the best part. The software is good, and the 1.67 GHz is plenty enough.the only thing i don't like is the freaking pulsating light. I try to sleep but I need a sheet over it before i can. if someone makes an application to disable that i will buy it on a whim.other than that no complaints."
4,A word of caution,"Apple needs to improve quality control and product support. The superdrive stopped working when laptop was 6 weeks old. Sent to Apple repair on April 4 and was informed 5 days later after I called that replacement wouldn't be available until end of April. New Superdrive could be quality control problem like permanent white spots on screens and batteries that catch fire of earlier models. Pity, because everything else about the machine is simply superb."
1,Después de un año se acabó,"Después de 1 año 3 meses de tenerla un buen día dejó de funcionar. 3 pitidos y nada más. La llevé al centro de servicio y me cobran la mitad del precio de nueva (28 mil pesos) por repararla (12 mil pesos). Obviamente no voy a gastar 12 mil pesos y sólo me queda comprar una laptop pc que sea rápida (muy lentita esta compu), que pueda reparar fuera del carísimo centro de servicio autorizado y que tenga refacciones. Un robo. La voy a tirar a la basura o a vender en partes. Cualquier duda sobre la veracidad de esta información escríbanme a mi e-mail. Sólo como anécdota. Lo mismo le pasó a mi ipod. Se descompuso y la única opción fue cambiarlo. Afortunadamente estaba en el año de garantía. Ipod U2. Apple = computadoras desechables."
1,Wow this DVD sucked!,"I DJ three different Industrial/Goth clubs and playing videos is a part of what I do and I am always on the look out for videos as they are hard to come by! I was excited to get this and it had to be one of the worst music DVD's I have ever purchased!First of all I really don't care too much for how good a video is as I understand goth/industrial bands are not rich and can't always make high end videos (they were all horrible anyway), however what I do care about is SOUND QUALITY. The sound on this DVD is just utter crap, I couldn't play one video off this DVD at the club, not one! Not only was the sound quality horrible the song/band selection needs a lot of help (for a DJ or club anyway) as they had to of picked the most boring songs possible for this!As a fan of this type of music and a DJ who plays it, I would recommend hanging on to your money."
3,An interesting addition to a Goth music collection,"A companion to the ""Goth Box"" CD set, the DVD distributed by Cleopatra Records (who else?) is suited to the more serious Goth fans. It features a mainstream debut of Switchblade Symphony's ""Clown"", as well as old favorites like Christian Death and Alien Sex Fiend. Most of the video tracks are old and new favorites, but there is a kind of slump in the middle. 3 or 4 tracks from bands like Chameleons U.K. seem more like early 80's pop or punk rather than goth. I would have liked to have seen videos from the heavy hitters, Bauhaus, Fields of the Nephilim, ect. Overall, if you're into goth, this is a must have. Along with the 4 CD music box set, this makes a perfect gift for the dark, freaky friends you may have."
2,Was o.k.,"I'm mildly into goth music, and I think the review written before saying this dvd is meant only for serious goth fans was correct. No imformation on the bands were provided and when I put the dvd in to paly it, I found I only knew two bands on the whole thing. The set up was also awkward. When playing the audio tracks it was difficult to go to the desired track with out listening to all the ones that came before it."
4,he sings?,"Not the greatest voice, I'm sure, but they knew how to produce songs back then to advantage.""Young Love"" (a #1 hit!) and ""Red Sails in the Sunset,"" and ""Apple Blossom Time"" are such products of their time, and very good.Gotta give him credit for going the recording route along with the acting."
4,"some buzzcocks, some very wave Pete, and a modern remix","a couple of billboard dance hits (telephone operator, homosapien, I don't know what it is) are accompanied by a lot electronic/new wave/punk sounds that capture the sound of the early 80s (Shelley's later stuff isn't included). You get 3 original tracks from Pete's days with the Buzzcocks, a remix/medley of Telephone Operator/Many a time, clocking in at 13 minutes and 11 seconds, and a great remix of Telephone Operator that runs 6 minutes and 14 seconds. Definitely a good sampling of Shelley's music to add to a thorough 80s collection."
2,"Tries hard, but comes up lacking.",The above review is an excellent description and as such I will spare everyone my similar experience. Just wanted to second the first review.
5,Best book of it's kind!,"This book helps readers to identify in what ways they may be hampered by their past and gives amazing practices to help overcome being stuck there. The author is compassionate but unerringly insightful about the defences we use to stop ourselves from incurring futher pain, yet he makes us want to move from that place by realizing how much we are cutting ourselves off from the joys of life.Perfect for recognizing where we victimize ourselves and showing precisely how to stop the pattern. He does not repeat himself and never leaves the gentle tone he sets up in the beginning.This book is a Bible!"
5,This book is a gift to the soul,"In this book the author outlines twelve distinct manifestations of childhood sorrow; lingering wounds that express themselves as points of tension between our emotional history and our spiritual unfolding. Each chapter begins by examining the shape of a particular childhood wound, and reveals how the scar from that wound affects our emotional and spiritual life.It includes teachings from Christian, Budhist, Hebrew, Sufi, Hindu, and Native American traditions that describe these same points of tensions as doorways of the spirit"
4,Help for growth beyond childhood hurts,"I would describe this as a self-help/spiritual guidance book for people struggling in their personal/spiritual growth because of the wounds of their childhood. I think that it might help people to identify the ways they are getting caught on old pain and thought patterns, and free themselves a bit.The book's perspective is arguably more psychological than spiritual, and it does not delve deeply into any particular spiritual tradition, nor is it for instance an exploration of the relationship between childhood pain and mystical experience. Mueller quotes more or less equally from a variety of different traditions, in a way that probably wouldn't be too offensive to any of them, unless the reader would be troubled by a quote from another religion or details of an eastern meditation practice.The quality of the writing is 4 stars out of 5; read the book for the advice and perspective rather than the way the author expresses himself which is nothing special."
1,Not all Models (3.7 V6 and 2.4 Petrol),"This manual only covers the 3.7 V6 and 2.4 Petrol models, thus does not warrant the label ""All Models"". I bought it with the express purpose of working on my 2.5CRD (I went directly to the Haynes site where they again said All Models). Well alas it excludes the 2.5CRD and the very common 2.8CRD. While I am sure it will not cover the Gearbox for the 2.5 and 2.8CRD's I am hopeful I will be able to use it on the Diff, brakes, etc. Pretty much 10% of the reason I bought the manual. I am not impressed with Haynes, it appears their manuals are becoming less valuable than they used to be."
2,No difference,"I tried this b/c it seemed like a good clean, natural way to wash my face and I was looking for something from a brand I trusted. I did not like this. It feels like you're rubbing thick oil on your face and rinsing it off. My face didn't tingle with cleanliness like I was expecting. It didn't feel cleaner - I just felt nothing.It does smell really good...almost good enough to drink!"
2,Doesn't work as good as it smells,"Over the course of about 5 or 6 months, I have reached the bottom of this bottle of cleanser. I won't be buying another, simply because it doesn't seem like it did anything. It didn't make my skin break out or cause any other negative effects, but it didn't seem to improve the health/appearance of my skin, either.I found it easy to apply and easy to wash off. The cleanser does not lather up or anything, but I always felt like my face was clean after using this cleanser. The orange smell is also truly wonderful. So, it smells good and makes my skin FEEL clean, but the results it produced seem no different from what would have happened if I just rinsed my face with water every night. Smells great but unfortunately didn't do much for me."
3,"Luxurious, but not very effective","I'll admit, I am kind of addicted to this stuff - it smells incredible, and it leaves my sensitive skin feeling so good. But like someone else mentioned, I'm not sure it really actually does anything. To me, it's more like something you keep around for a night in with the girls for some occasional pampering and relaxation. I still break out, so I don't think I'll buy it again."
1,Yikes!,"I love Burt's Bees products and I was really excited to find a 100% natural facial cleanser, but this one is awful. It left my face feeling horribly greasy and didn't even remove my make-up! (It left eye liner smeared all around my eyes instead.)It smells good, which is nice, but not if it doesn't work. I have ""regular"" skin, so I'd hate to see what it's like for someone with oily skin. I tried another Burt's facial cleanser that has fewer natural ingredients and leaves my skin feeling nice -- not dry but not greasy either. At least it didn't give me zits..."
5,Great for Cradle Cap,"This product left my face quite greasy, as it contains olive oil. When the pediatrician suggested using baby oil on my 4-month-old's cradle cap, I did not want to use chemicals or purfumes on him, so I thought to use Burt's Bees orange essence natural facial cleanser (so natural you can eat it). I rubbed it all over his scalp and let it soak in overnight, then I bathed him and scrubbed with a washcloth. The cradle cap was gone! I used it in subsequent babies, where it only got most of the cradle cap. Also, I rub it into the scalp and scrape at it with a fingernail while the baby is on my lap. Looks like a few little hairs come off with it, but didn't have any noticable effect on his hairdo (even as little hair as baby has)."
4,Interesting point of view,"This book is about the voyages of Christopher Columbus as reported by a man who, according to this account, sailed with him. Interesting book. It was a good read."
3,Almost Great,"The book was enjoyable, but a lot of the text dealt with historical events that were not exactly ""twists of fate in America's past"". Yes, Nixon's cancelled speech on the Apollo XI mission and Eisenhower's unneeded apology for the failure of the D-Day invasion are covered -- but so is Nixon's FBI application and a published hoax on the history of the bathtub in America. Was it worth the $19 (Amazon.com's discounted price)? Yes, at least in my opinion since I love ""what if"" scenarios."
3,Could have been better...,"There were a lot of things in this book that were interesting (Churchill's near-death by taxicab), unusual (Losing the Astronauts) and virtually unknown (The American Revolution Truce Plan) but the book failed to reach out and touch more profound and strange episodes in U.S. history. What about the Confederate Constitution? Aaron Burr's plans in the Northwest Territory? Reconstruction proposals that would have remade the South into entirely new states? The Olympic Plan for the invasion of Japan?Perhaps it is nit-picking as to what was picked for the book and what was not but when you have to include a chapter on urban legends you're probably not hitting all the key points."
3,"Good Book, but expected More","This was an ""impulse"" buy for me. I was browsing CNN.com one day and there was a favorable review of this book. I've always been a history buff so I thought this book would be very interesting.Don't get me wrong, it is interesting. It's just that each piece is only a few pages long. For instance, what if the Allied Forces had failed on D-Day? What would have been the long range implecations? The nice part about the chapters being short is that it's a very easy read. I can pick it up and just read a little if I want."
1,Bogus offering,This is the second (seeEnglish adjective comparison and analogy [An article from: Lingua]) Lingua digital article offered by Elsevier that I have purchased. In both cases the offering was bogus. All you get is the title and a list of references. In the other purchase I also got a copy of the abstract already available for free on the product description page. In the present case not even that was provided. No way was provided to contact Elsevier that I could find.
4,One Tough Turkey Gets One Great Grade,I use this book in my third grade class every November to get them in the Thanksgiving holiday spirit. I recommend it to any elementary school teacher and encorage them to read it to their class!
1,Run... don't walk,"I was excited to get this. I knew nothing about it except what I read from the reviews here on Amazon. I have NO IDEA what these people are smoking!!! This is complete drivel, trash; it's moronic and idiotic (is that redundant?).This was clearly written by a teenager because no adult in their right mind would write this way or have these repugnant ideas. Don't get me wrong... I am not against porn, sex, sexual stories, sexual domination, adding some ""spice and adventure"" to the act or even the idea of being ""possessed"" sexually. I enjoy them maybe a tad more then your average female, but this book is revolting. If this is the author's idea of sexual fantasy... please see several shrinks... not just one... you need it urgently!"
1,"No, just NO!","I really do love Jaid Black's other works so I had no problem with plunking down my money for this trilogy. Wish I had my money back. This was just a really bad rehash of the Trek series. The differance is that the Trek series has humor and alpha males you enjoy, Death Row does not. This is just a ""me man, you nothing but something I have sex with or I will hurt you"" type of story. And while I like a good D/s story line, this is not it. The Alpha's in this book may say they ""love"" their females, but it never shows. Most of they time they are degrading them, both physically and mentally, and using them like second hand sex dolls. This is not a book I would recommend to anyone unless they like their heroines to be weak, submissive and have no opinions about their life. Hope the next books will improve."
2,Not much information here,"To start off let me tell you that this book could have been written in just one chapter. The entire book is so repetitive that it becomes an annoyance. The few pieces of relevant information in this book are worth the read, after all this book is fairly inexpensive. However, beware that the author mostly mentions incidents affecting religious figures in Central America. As if religious figures and their prosecution by SOA graduates are the only subjects worth detailing. I was really disappointed by this and the author's constant religious tone. In addition, the author never stops pushing the SOA Watch and his other books. This book seemed to me more like a fancy pamphlet for the SOA Watch an less, much less, of an objective look at the School of the Americas and the case of closing it down like the title suggests."
2,The good the bad and the ugly.,"Well if you are reading this review my condolences, good luck with your shoulder surgery and rehab.The Good:Solid, well built.The Bad:Personally I did not care for this devices and can't recommend it for a couple of reasons:1. Hanging of a hollow core door this did seem stable, worked better off a six panel door.2. I prefer the stretch and pull directly overhead not at an angle. We re-engineered his to hang off a floor joist in the basement so it was directly over my head and as sturdy as the Rock of Gibraltar (maybe not quite as sturdy, but it was solid).The Ugly,I tore my Rotator Cuff again and am going back to surgery so I get to use it again.Bottom line, save your money get a hanger hook screw, pulley, and a piece of rope. Good luck!!"
5,one of his better movies,"Non stop action in this one! Lots of shoot-en up and blow stuff up! Good plot and good acting, good editing too. This one could have made it into Theaters, it's that good. One of Seagal's best in years!"
1,Be careful there is no story in this story,Don't expect the story in this study guide. It isn't there.
5,Grim,"This was one of the most difficult books to read that I've ever attempted. It's long, relentless, cold, unappealing and ugly. It's horrible in a thousand explicitly mundane ways. It took me weeks to grind my way through, and I'm truly glad I made the effort. It's stuck with me ever since. I don't think I've encountered a more horrifyingly truthful book."
2,Very dissapointing considering the standard of Catch 22.,Ponderous and Shambolic overall.Could have done with a lot of trimming. IFound one problem withe the book: NOTHINGHAPPENED!
1,Starts off brilliant; turns horrible midway,"Did Joseph Heller proofread his own stuff? There are so many useless -- and misused -- parentheticals in this novel that it is hard to stay focused. One minute you're starting a sentence, Heller goes off on a 15 sentence sidethought that has nothing to do with the sentence he started writing, and then 3 minutes later you're back in the middle of the sentence he started... but you have to go back and see just how that sentence began! It's completely absurd. And frustrating. I was beginning to scream obscenities out loud.The first part of the book is brilliant. Funny. Refreshing, really. I thought I was about to read the best thing I've read since... well, Catch-22. But halfway through the chapter on the unhappy daughter the novel becomes tiringly tedious. A task. When was reading supposed to feel like such a job?I couldn't finish it. Others who actually have gotten through it say nothing happens anyway! (And it took him 13 years to write this?)"
2,Nothing Funny Happens,"Something Happened was not a terrible book...it just didn't fit my expectations of it. When I pick up a Heller book to read, I look forward to enjoying the wit displayed in it. In Something Happened, however, Heller took a more serious tone, making the book more of a thoughtful exploration of the narrator's life and eliminating his characteristic humor. I think that Heller is a much better writer when he is being funny so I recommend that people read Catch-22 or God Knows before Something Happened."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting something more along the lines of Catch 22, a lot of cussing and sexual exploits in this book. I found it rather boring."
2,something happened,"weird, just weird. Didn't get too far in to the book. I may give it another try in the future."
2,Nothing Happens...,"I reminded myself how lucky I was to have picked up Catch 22 first. For if I didn't, I wouldn't have bothered to once reading Something Happened. After getting lost in the wacky but wonderful story captured by Catch 22, I couldn't wait to dive into another work by Heller. However, I found myself greatly disappointed this time around. Although an interesting approach to writting the novel (the majority of it is simply an inner monologue dealing with the conflict of the main character), I just wasn't captured by it. This may be due to its depressing nature. Hint: if you are trapped in a job you dislike with a family that you're not sure you belong in, don't read this book!"
1,Am I missing something?,"As others before me noted, a more accurate title for this 500 page novel would be ""Nothing Happened."" I read the first 480 pages, then could stand the torture no more and skipped to the last two pages. The language and style are superb but the entire book could really be shortened to play out on a couple of pages. Clearly, Joseph Heller was a master of repetition as the book says the same thing over and over again in thousands of different ways. It seems that everyone who has reviewed this book admits there was no plot of which to speak, however, what they fail to admit is that this a major flaw of the book, probably because they want to believe that they didn't waste the 5 hours it took to read this incredibly long and uneventful novel. Well, read and see for yourself but I think your time could be better spent reading something else."
2,I wish something HAD happened!,"Although Heller offers a familiar, intelligent and amusing insight into the routine boredom of the modern workplace, the story itself becomes stale and repetitive without the aid of plot or direction. Far too lengthy and without a payoff"
2,What the hell happens?,"I laughed a lot during the first act but that act was quickly worn out. Boredom set in as the first part of the story was told over and over again. The only thing that kept me going was to find out what this ""something"" was. Then I was treated to a couple lousy paragraphs of what could have been a pivotal moment but instead nothing came of it. Life continued as before- nothing changed when everything should have due to the fact that the central character kept telling us how on the edge he was. A good editor could trim this book down to 100 well written pages and push the author for another 400 to let us know what really happened. Too late now!"
5,Whoa mama ... bone-chilling stuff,"true to life but outdated only on the office equipment.Great, biting satire on the American dream. The way he handles his daughter to the way he handles his extra-marital affairs: with panache and panic.Bob Slocum is the silent voice of the majority of the working people. People who have just gone one step further out than expected."
5,By Far One of the Best,"Brandi Wells aka Peaches from my very own home town of Chester, Pa is a very remarkable vocalist who will have you toe curling, eyes shut tight and thinking thoughts shared only for that special someone....honestly by far a must have in your collection."
4,Up Front In Vietnam,"This book brought back many memories,good and bad. Did have a bit of a start in the chapter titled ""A Nose for the VC"", it was about my dog Fritz and I. As it has been said, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. The entire book gives the reader a very good view of what took place, with the military, during the year 1966 in Vietnam. My granddaughter, she is sixteen, read the book and was blown away. It was more history than she ever has learned in school."
5,A reluctant reader's joy,"Kevin Scott Collier's ability to write a story in e-mail form is pure talent. I've seen this technique before and quickly became bored with it. His word choices and message can hold the most reluctant, child-reader captive. Jordon Mink, the Angel who accidentally sent an e-mail to Bart, creates an intriguing picture of Heaven. He also answers all of Bart's questions with skill and honesty. Kids will appreciate Collier's style of writing. I recommend this book for boys and girls, as well as adults who need their heart-warmed."
5,Simply Stunning !!!!!!,"Watching this movie is the equivalent of a whole Semester in Psychology at the Finest Ivy League College ,the realisim isPhenomenal!!!,I was so drawn into the Screen I felt apart of the furniture in the Bunker ....and the Acting is ...well you do not even think about it ...because there NOT acting ...it's them ...only German unknowns could have took this to this Level ,I feel privleged to have seen it on the Big screen with Awesome sound effects ..now I am waiting for the DVD to treasure for LIFE ..."
5,Excellent !!!,"I must admit I rarely have the patience to sit thru a subtitled movie, but DOWNFALL is so well done, I did not mind and I think hearing 100% German in relation to the time period and subject helped reinforce the realism.Whenever a movie can make you (even for the briefest of seconds) forget you are watching a movie and really get pulled in, then it succeeds.Downfall does this superbly.On the otherhand, garbage like Hollywood's ""PEARL HARBOR"" from a few years back looks and ""feels"" like a Hollywood set and movie and you never really ""believe"" you are in 1945.With DOWNFALL you can almost get the sense you are in the bunker with Hitler and the SS during the Final Days."
4,"Great film, but if you speak German...","There's a 3-disc extended version of Der Untergang available through Amazon.de for less than fourteen Euros. That edition has many deleted scenes edited back into the film and (literally) hours of extras. The caveat is that some of the extras have no subtitles and the movie itself requires a region-free player, as it is coded Region 2. Such machines are not nearly as expensive as they once were and can be picked up for less than $40 sometimes."
4,Destined to become a classic...,"This film will surely become a classic. What more can be said that other reviewers have not mentioned? Looking back one can see how normal decent people were sucked into the Nazi myth and propaganda. Bruno Ganz as Hitler renders a superb performance. I like the fact that characters are not ""introduced"". One has to know something about the Reich to discern Gobbels, Goring, Himmler and other assorted sycophants.This film is in German with english sub-titles. My only complaint is that the font size on the subtitles made reading the dialogue quite difficult and thus took something away from the visual aspect. Secondly, towards the end of the movie, for some reason; the subtitles seemed to roll faster.One of the secretaries to Hitler, frau Trudl, stated in an interview that she could have done something and that her youth was no excuse. Maybe. In later years Trudl did do something, she helped later generations understand the nightmare that was the Thousand Year Reich."
2,hitler in the bunker...again,"It was an okay movie. I'm just an average guy, not a Nazi history buff or anything. I've seen a few Hitler documentaries about Hiter's last days in the bunker, and this movie just seems like a rather blah dramatization of a documentary. I liked that it was spoken in German. I liked the look of the movie. But it's forgettable once it's over and you move on with the rest of your day. I'm sure it's a much more moving story for Hitler fantatics."
5,Not what I needed,"I was looking for movie in German so that I would practice the language, but it is impossible. The English subtitles are preset all through the movie and it does not give me the option of turning them off. When the add said it was in German, I expected to be in German with no english subtitles. In my case it was a waste of money."
2,Great Movie - Obnoxious DvD ads on the Blu Ray Disc,"Since I loaned my regular DvD copy out (and of course forgot who had it) I ordered the Blue Ray version.All I can say is if you want to watch this move, plan ahead - like a good driver - look way down the road - put it on the DvD player an hour or so ahead while it runs through all the obnoxious ads, (and as the years go by ads for which they are irrelevant) then after dinner hopefully the Downfall's menu will be ready for you.So far it has had 5-10 minutes of ads, with no ability to skip to the movie menuHonestly if I had known they were this obnoxious I wouldn't have bought it.They should be paying ME by the minute for every minute their odorous crap is on, preventing me from watching what I thought I was paying for."
4,More than expected,"Some good history for those who haven't heard it before. Some great acting for everyone. Well worth your time. Some echoes for our time. ""They gave us a mandate... """
4,A VERY GOOD MOVIE,"Dealing with the last days of the Third Reich, including Adolf Hitler, DOWNFALL resurrects a time most of us living today never knew personally. But through this movie the horrors of war, and the ramifications of decisions taken by men in power, make it all painfully real again. Some excellent performances and haunting scenes make this a very powerful, unforgettable movie. EXTRAS include ""making of.."" featurette (in German with subtitles)."
3,GANZ PLUS SCHMALTZ,"Ganz is excellent bordering on brilliant, but ther4e is a walk-through quality to the overall mise en scene. These people are a little too human, and not enough singled out. If Speer or another major figure were explored deeply and others thinned out, the film could have been excellent in its totality"
4,Downfall,"This is one of the best versions of the last days of Hitler in the underground bunker. Some historical events depicted conflict with versions described by other survivors [Kempka, Misch, Speer].Especially the execution of SS Lt. General Hermann Fegelein.Or, have been omitted altogether.But the acting, especially the portrail of Hitler is outstanding. Also, I think that this film kept in the original German,does not detract from its impact or believability at all, I remember when ""Stalingrad"" was dubbed in English, it lost something. All in all, a great film, glade I bought it."
4,Downfall,Excellent! Sometimes confusing by insufficient identification of individual characters. No cast which actor/actress is playing whom.
3,not the movie but the DVD,"Nothing to add to the very good comments on the film: it's more than very good. Bruno Ganz extraordinary. The film deserves 5 stars. However, I give it 3 to the DVD because of two flaws: first, the 5.1 audio has no alternatives, and what about those viewers who do not own home theater systems but stereos? A two channel audio option is missing. Second, you cannot turn off the subtitles because they are default, and the only option! -what about French, Spanish, etc?- and this is in a certain way disturbing -you know, some persons outside Germany speak German."
2,They would very much like to apologise...and apologise...and...,"Downfall makes its point, if any, in the first half hour and then it's a laborious trawl to the finishing line. Its need to portray every suicidal shot to the head and crushed poison capsule in conscientious detail smacks of the German need for efficiency and one is minded with some irony that it is precisely this type of industrialized slaughter that got them into trouble in the first place."
1,Check out the Reviews on amazon.co.uk and amazon.de!,"I was curious when I got this recommendation from amazon.com, since I was interested in finally watching this movie, of which I heard a lot of great things.Then, due to the lack of reviews here, I checked out some on the british and german amazon sites. It appears the the Blu-Ray has severe shortcomings: Dark picture, bad Dolby soundtrack (compared with the DTS soundtrack of the region 2 DVD), and fixed english subtitles in the picture over the german soundtrack (which is listed as ""english"" on all amazon sites).I'll wait until there is a good Blu-Ray release in the US or germany before I order this."
1,Heroic Portrait of a Group of Cowards,"The movie is made too independent of the events that led up to the bunker; consequently, the viewer feels sorry for the ""benevolent"" Führer by the time he is shaking hands with his immediate staff for his and hers farewell suicides. The woman that portrays Eva Braun did a nice job; as far as women actors go, I was glad that strong personalities were given to women (Eva Braun & Frau Goebbel)."
5,A PERFORMANCE FOR THE AGES,"Jamie Foxx did an incredible job as Ray Charles, but it doesn't compare to Bruno Ganz' portrayal of Hitler in this film. I have done extensive study on Hitler. It's obvious Ganz has done his homework as well. From his posture, his mannerisms and even his speech, it's almost like watching Hitler in the flesh. This portrayal is up there with Scott's ""Patton"" Brando's ""Don Corleone"" as a watershed moment in acting.Another performance worthy of note is the lady that plays Magda Goebbels. She is the most coldly monstrous female villian onscreen since Louis Fletcher's ""Nurse Ratched"" in Cuckoo's NEst."
5,Right to the point,"Ill keep this review short and the point. Excellent film, great acting, amazing drama between characters. GO SEE IT, OR BUY THE DVD. IT IS WORTH THE $9.00 ADMISSION AND THE $25.00 POPCORN."
5,Not just for YouTube Use!,"Yes, the YouTube interpretations on this movie has been hilarious and I am the first to say that I've wet myself watching the subtitles some have put over Bruno Ganz's acting. The best part of the YouTube phenomenon is to bring back to light a very excellent film.It's a great movie. Not just good, but great. It's claustrophobic, dark and frightening well-acted. Bruno Ganz (a favorite of mine since playing an angel in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire, 1987) sizes up and brings down the character of Hitler in his last days, almost to the point of sympathy for the twitchy, repulsive, aging monster. Ganz was apparently so convincing in costume, he could not move about the set without the effect of cast and crew recoiling.So, yes: watch this. And not whilst drinking or when feeling exceptionally bleak, please.Make sure to see Wings of Desire. Bruno is delicious."
4,"Engaging, Fantastic Story of Hitler's Fall","I never knew Hitler was a vegetarian, but that is just the tip of the iceberg of information this film delivers in a finely acted and superb screenplay of Hilter's last days in his bunker.I wouldn't say this is on the top tier of war films(Das Boot, Schindler's List), but it does deliver a riveting account from one of Hitler's secretaries, as one of histories worst war criminals sinks into his own madness of hell.Recommended for more maturer audiences(subtitles, and a little long in some spots), but it is important to truly understand the mind of a mass murderer, as he takes himself and his followers into their deaths."
5,Satisfied customer,Modern European history is a pastime of mine and the study I have done of Hitler's last days in his bunker was accurately portrayed by the director and the artists performing were excellent.
5,Must See,This movie should be required viewing for all high school students. Saw it three times while on the big screen and could hardly wait for it to be on DVD or VHS for home viewing. Even though it is in German with English subtitles you do not miss a word. The truth about the end of the war has finally been told. The three hours sent by so fast.
5,The two faces of Hitler,"When I first started viewing this movie, I was disturbed by the very ""human"" portrayal of Hitler. This is especially apparent when the young Traudl Junge goes for a very bizarre job interview with Hitler. But if you watch the movie in its totality, you understand why the filmmakers did that.This is an incredibly well made movie; maybe the best done on Hitler's last days. If you are well versed in WWII history and have read Ryan's Last Battle and Kershaw's Berlin 1945, then there is nothing new here but the performances are incredible and so is the setting. They really went to great lengths to give one a sense of the clautrophobia and absolute mania surrounding Hitler and his cronies. I highly recommend this film."
4,Amazingly Well Researched and Executed,"Difficult to watch at times, but too fascinating to quit. This doesn't play like a movie ""about"" something, or even a documentary. It's almost something like 'living history.' Appears to be well researched historically and I didn't get the sense that the makers made too many assumptions or took many liberties for the sake of drama. The acting was spot on and not the least bit self indulgent. The result is a stark and disturbing slice of history. If you watch this and ""The White Ribbon"", I think you can get a pretty accurate glimpse of the mentality that gave rise to Nazi Germany. And 75 or so years later, a few generations removed, it's still bloody frightening."
5,Downfall,"I have been an avid student of World war II for many years. I have read several books about Hitler including Hitler's Bunker by Joachim Fest. This move is powerful. As I watched it, I was reminded again just how cruel and vicious the Nazi regime was. They were murdering and executing their own people right up to the very end of Hitler's regime. Bruno Ganz gave one powerful performance in the role of Hitler. The movie is a must see production. After watching it, I was reminded again that this evil must not be allowed to happen again. One final thought: the movie is very close to what Fest described in his book."
5,WOW,"Amazing acting by Bruno Ganz, awesome camera work, and truly harrowing at times to see Hitlers final 10 days in his bunker while Russia was heading towards victory over Germany. It's a subtitled film, FYI but I like films like that, and I even learn some German words here and there : )"
5,Outstanding!,"Filmed in Germany in German by Germans - it stands with the best easily.The film portrays Hitler and his associates/sycophants during the last days of the Reich, as told by his surviving personal secretary. The portrayal of Hitler is fascinating - you get a sense of a man gone completely mad, and yet isn't - and the people who surrounded him were equally mad, and yet fanatical in their beliefs.For those considering showing this to teens and others as a historical document - know this - take the R rating VERY seriously. The blood and gore of war is shown graphically, as are several of the suicides."
4,Downfall,"a poor actor showing the world how anybody, driven by hate, will go down in history in the worst way."
2,"Excellent movie, does not have subtitles in Spanish","The movie is excellent. Incredible reconstruction.Unfortunately, no subtitles in Spanish and it is not clear in the description of the product"
3,"It is a ""Downfall"" that this movie is in German!","Good movie - but it's all in German with english sub-titles!Amazon should have noted this under the product discription.Other than that the film gives a good account of Hitler's last daysin his bunker, surrounded by his army chiefs, and unwilling tobelieve that he was losing the war. There is nothing about theconcentration camps as the story is told through the eyes ofHitlers young secretary Trudi."
3,The human side of a murderer,A unique view on the last days of Hitler and his aides. Three hundred thousand Russians of the Red army perished overtaking Berlin and somehow the viewer is supposed to feel empathy for this man's declining mental state.
3,Good movie,I saw excerpts from this movie all over the internet and wanted to see the whole movie. It was well worth the purchase.
3,RECOMMENDED,"Ganz's Hitler is an interesting study in deranged contrasts. The film was highly controversial in Germany because many felt that he (Hitler) was too sympathetically portrayed. Who knows what the final days in that bunker were really like, but this heavy drama seems very believable."
1,Doesn't work,"These blades did not clean my windshield, they only smeared the muck. These are so bad I think they should pulled off the market as a safety concern."
1,terrible wiper,"This wiper made the windshield so smeary , I could hardly see to drive. It was like there was oil all over the window. I went home and cleaned it with several products, but nothing worked. I had to go to the store to buy another brand so I could drive safely ."
