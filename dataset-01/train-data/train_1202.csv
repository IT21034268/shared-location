1,Would not buy another canon product,"My Canon SD900 is just over 2 years old and all of a sudden after charging the battery does not turn on. Charged a brand new battery and same result. Contacted Canon and for a charge of $129.00 plus tax plus shipping to and back, they can fix the camera. After researching, appears that this is a common problem for no reason the camera does not turn on. Quality of pictures and camera when working was very good. However, to spend all this money on a camera to be functional for 2 years and cost to repair being so high, shame on Canon to sell such a product. My recommendation, is stay away from Canon cameras. I will. Off to buy another digital camera and throwing this one in the garbage."
3,systemic fragility,"A beautiful camera with lovely intuitive controls. We purchased two. Both cameras soon suffered from cracked viewing screens. Now, lens retraction problems on a very babied camera. The $100 screen replacement should not be standard operating procedure. Too Fragile!"
3,Canon is always good.,"I have owned this camera for about a year now, and I love it! I have found many cool functions and color swaps and effects that it does and I am always asked what kind of camera I use when people see my pictures and they say ""I wish mine would do that!""I thought I should explain my three star rating, this camera focuses rather slowly and misses a lot of good shots also it seems to register camera shake ALL THE TIME on indoor shots so I have gotten used to ignoring that. The ability to make a black and white shot pick out one color in the picture (all from the camera menu) make this a cool camera but I purchased the XTI soon after this and wish I never bought this powershot."
3,too small and lightweight to avoid shacking,nice size but i wanted the high resolution so i can zoom in on photos afterwards. well because it's small and lightweight every picture i took was blurry because i apparently shake to much. i don't have a shake to my hand that i have ever noticed before and the camera i bought to replace it is fine.
5,Magnificent,"Impressive, tons of compliments, this beauty is magnificent, Bought as gift for my son who lives in Miami Beach,FL. He was loving all functions And the 10 megapix is fantastic,with titanium body, love it...Canon PowerShot SD900 Titanium 10MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom"
5,Another hit or Canon,"Last year I purchased an SD550 for my wife but I did not use many of its features until a month ago while on a trip overseas. I discovered the Digital Macro setting under manual, and that has become my favorite setting. It eliminates the need for flash under most conditions and the color reproduction with digital effect is amazing, especially for portraits. One can eliminate redeye by not using a flash so the digital macro really comes in handy there and also by increasing the ISO without flash which has the added bonus of reducing camera shake as well. Needless to say, I left the camera on the airplane when I returned and had to buy a replacement. After much review reading and comparison shopping, I purchased the SD900 which I love more than the SD550. Good work Canon."
5,thanks so much!,"the camera is exactly the same as the one I dipped in the lake...oops! It works with the model-specific water case that I should have used to avoid this predicament! The camera was in great used condition, exactly as specified, complete with manuals, charger and extra battery, as well as a 2 mg card. Thanks so much for the speedy and quality service!"
5,Best Camera I have ever owned!!,I have owned quite a few digital cameras and they have been nothing like i wanted. If i just moved the camera the slightest bit when i was taking the picture the whole thing would come out blury. But with this camera i can be moving the camera in a complete cirlce or folowing someone with the camera and it comes out amazingly clear.
5,Canon Ixus 900Ti,"Yup, thats what this camera is called in Asia.Basically, its the same camera mentioned above, packed with lots of powerful feature and new processor digi III.Overall, I am satisfied with the performance of this camera, i normally use the manual mode in color-ccent for cool 'sin city' effect ; for the scn shot, I normally used nightshot for night and foilage for cool effects in the forest."
5,CANON IS THE WAY TO GO,"I have used Canon Digital Cameras for years. First because they were compatible with Mac. But now because they are user-friendly and always result in excellent photographs. On top of that, the customer service I've received from Canon is amazing -- even after the warranty has expired. They are very helpful and nice. Now, that I have their latest camera, the amazing SD900, there's only one problem: when I pull it out to take pictures, people want to touch it and see it and play with it. In other words, they're so impressed with how the camera looks and how small and lite it is, I can't get it back to actually take pictures at the occasion."
5,Great Camera!,"Best camera I ever owned! It does so many things I don't know if I'll ever get to them all. I was a bit intimidated by it at first but then, unlike many including myself prior to purchasing this one, I read the simple directions. It is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship and takes wonderful pictures. I also purchased the 2G picture card so I started with almost 1000 shots and since before New Yew Years I've shot about 300 picture! It's amazing and I couldn't be happier with the quality.I was a bit ""put off"" by some reviewers mention of it being ""noisy"" I'm glad I took a chance on it. The ""noise"" is the normal open and closing sound a camera makes when you open or close ANY camera or click the shutter. It's a great buy. It was at least $100.00 cheaper than Best Buy or Circuit City and that allowed me to buy a few extras. You can get a nice camera case at Wal-Mart for $5.64 but the memory card is a deal."
4,nice camera.,"NIce camera, might seem big, but fits in hand very comfortably, in pockets it gets some time to get used to.Only used a few times. Too bad this camera doesn't have a image stabilizer. OTher than that, if you use the auto setting, it'll take good pictures, but if you turn of the flash, the picture will get somewhat blurry since they ISO setting will get low. but other than that, im happy.hate the fact Canon cameras doesnt have a battery meter display, only a low battery warning."
1,Stay away!!,"""lens error, restart camera"" message appears today (mar 26) after buying production on amazon on feb 20, 07. When I searched google for this error message saw thousands of canon users having similar error / e18 error with older and newer version of the canon. I have tried panasonic and sonys before and never had an issue. I dread that canon customer service is going to waste my hours in getting a replacement and ultimately may end up charging me over a 100 for repairs like they have done to other users(after reading user feedback on web)."
5,This is the coolest camera,I Love this camera. It is alittle over my head but I'm excited about learning all the different things it's capable of doing. It's not hard but I'm still reading the manual because it has so many more options than my old canon not to mention alot smaller which is what I was after. I looked at alot of cameras and for it's price range this was my favorite then I found it alot cheaper on amazon.
3,"Good Camera, but not up to my expectation","This camera is a good camera for taking object that don't move much. I tried to take pictures of my 5-month old baby, only about 2 out of 10 pictures are clear, because she moved her head so much. I used the kids & pet option and tried all kind of combinations to increase the shutter speed, but failed. I gave up and returned the camera."
3,SECOND WARNING,"Great pictures, great features. However, I had the same experience as a previous reviewer related to exposure to weather. This camera got damp (emphasize damp only) upon which it ceased to operate. After apparently drying out, all functions returned - except the LCD screen (which Canon reports is not ecomonically feasible to repair). This situation was unexpected as my SD800 (with wide-angle lens and a different type of casing) that I use as part of my work (outdoors) is pretty regularly awash in rain - and I haven't had any such problems over the past year. Thus, as previously stated, be warned in regard to the SD900."
2,"Junk, ""Lens Error Problem is common, no fix, camera junked after this...""","Fell in love with this camera, used it for 2 years, then out of the blue, the lens would not retract and a message of ""lens error, please restart camera"" comes up, changing batteries did not fix it, nothing did. Looked on the Internet and found this is a common problem."
3,good,"this is a very nice book. i did not know that it was going to be so big. the shipping was great and the price, just the right space to write."
4,Imagination interprets his Foreign Service experience,"The Foreign Service has many would-be-writers,who want to turn their exotic overseas adventures into novels and short stories. I know because I'm one of them. It is a rare one who can transform those experiences into stand-alone literary creations that do not center on the American diplomat protagonist. Mark Jacobs has succeeded. He is an inspiration. His foreign characters come alive. The interactions of cultures rings true. His sensitivity shines. I'm glad he's a writer. I'm also glad he represents his country abroad."
2,There's Better Kwaito Out There,"I was in South Africa in 2003 and heard a lot of the recent Kwaito releases. Many people seem to like this one but I find it to be largely overrated. Definitely go with Mapaputsi ""Izinja"" and Mafikizolo ""Sibongile"" over this disc, or also consider TKZee ""Halloween."" Honestly, I'm not sure what the hype is over this guy. Have a good listen before you buy this."
4,Monsoon Experience,"If you love chaos (and who doesn't on occasion), you'll love Monsoon Wedding. But if you like a bit of order everey once in a while, if you want to hear people speaking in normal tones of voice (i.e., less than an hysterical shout) and if you want everything to work out well in an understandable way, then you should avoid this movie. The characters are cartoons and the setting is nothing short of claustrophobic, but that shouldn't cause any problem so long as you never ask the question ""What's going on here?"" I imagined that the movie took place in Los Angeles and that helped, but alas, it was India. It's not Mississippi Masala, but it is a darned sight better than most Bollywood films. The plot reminded me of British cinema of the 1960s and 1970s, and the acting seemed so much like slice-of-life that I had to consult my wrist-watch clock-calendar to make sure I hadn't boarded a time machine. But in the end it was all great fun."
4,Invite yourself to a traditional Indian wedding!,"We enjoyed this film in the theater and wanted a copy to view at home. It's a picture of India one rarely has seen altho more Indian movies are available nowadays.The story is fascinating on its own, but the visuals are arresting and you feel what life in India is like.We highly recommend this film."
5,Good Movie,I love this movie from the first time I saw it. It's India's version of my My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Enjoy watching it!
4,Preview for a Hindu Wedding,If you're planning on attending a Hindu wedding and don't know what to expect this is a good preview. It's a touching story and worth seeing.
5,Spectacular!!!,"This is one of the best I've seen in 2002. Another thing, no one moved until the end of the credits.....you just don't want to leave :)"
5,Not your typical all american flik,This film is so sweet and whimsical. The cultural aspects depicted in the film are what amused me the most. The two love stories intertwined into one main plot is very well put together. This has been my favorite film for several years now and just watching it again made me remember just how much I love it. I highly recommend this international film for those who like to venture into other cultures for entertainment. This is a must see! Love some of the music as well!!
4,A successful attempt at Indian life,"I will admit, that at first, I was very suspicious about this movie. Is it possible to capture all the emotions of an indian wedding in one movie?Mira came very close in her attempt.There are many stories here. The story of the girl who gives up hope on her lover to try an arranged marriage. The story of the wedding planner who falls for the maid of the house. The story of the college boy who learns to appreciate his culture.And then, the most shocking story of all, of the girl who thinks she lives as a stranger in the household and as the suspense builds you realize her shocking tale and how the house copes.Monsoon Wedding is a movie for everyone to enjoy at every level. It is definitely worth it to stick it out to the end for all the surprises and twists.You'll want to share it with others after you're done."
1,I hate it,"There's something in this movie that really annoyes me. I mean, who enjoies seeing all the loud and nosy relatives getting even louder and restless over a worthless marriage of a girl who's cheating her groom??? And what's up with all the people overacting with obviously dubbed voice?? I just don't see any point in this movie. Be cheesy? Act loud? Be classist and sexist? Cheating fiance is no big deal?? Just go to America and everything's gonna go fine????? (...) .. this movie really annoies me."
5,Loved it!,"I was absolutely surprised by this film. It was quite different than the typical ""bollywood"" flick, but it including those elements in a spare, yet flirty way.The acting was great, the set and scenery amazing, and the storyline was compelling.I felt like a voyeur in the life of a priviledged group of Indians preparing for a feast with gusto, and typical ""father of the bride"" issues. The contrasts of modern technology v. traditional ceremony is brilliant.If you want ""bollywood"" you get a taste of dance, music, and splendor, but there is a back-story as well that adds a very special element which will appeal to a broader audience. [BTW, the commentary was a huge bonus, and I can't wait to watch more of Rajit Kapoor's work -- I'm awaiting the short story collection as I write this]. My vote is yes yes yes, it's definitely worth owning!"
4,Monsoon Wedding,"The best of Bollywood. Has music but is not swamped by it, and it fits in. Best of all, this is serious realistic drama, not dreamy fantasia. India is up to serious movie making, and this proves it. Subtitles are discreet, and much of the script is in English anyhow. Gorgeous visually, as one would expect from India."
4,Houston Hindu in Delhi Culture Clash,"An arranged wedding is the occasion for exploring the clash of generations and cultures. The bride and groom are both Indian, sure enough, but Hemant is a computer programmer from Houston and Aditi is from Delhi."
3,Inda - Monsoon Wedding,I like this DVD because it is a fun movie plus it shows life in India. It is hard to believe how crowded it is in Delhi.
3,not your typical Bollywood,"I bought this film after hearing positive reviews. However, I was surprised to find it contained no musical numbers, for which I am most interested in Indian 'Bollywood' films. Thus was a bit dissapointed. Nonetheless, if you're not expecting that, then this film pleases as a romantic comedy."
1,Unintelligible drivel,"From the first frame, until 5 minutes into the film when we turned it off, it was terrible! The audio is so bad that it would have been better to have subtitles for all the dialog even the english.This is a bad ripoff of ""Father of the Bride.""This is a zero star film. Stay away from this movie & save your money!"
2,"Lovely music, simple plot, bad words.","A typical, overheated, scene-chewing bollywood type movie. I thought my young granddaughter would love the colorful costumes and lively music. I'm fortunate the film was in Hindi and she is as yet not able to read the subtitles. The language was exceptionally coarse. I would have been embarrassed if she had understood the English words. Its also a strange movie in that it moves from a simplistic plot and cartoon characters into a story line of a pedophile uncle preying on a young niece. Spoiler alert! Then a big moral ending."
2,DVD different from original movie--?,"I saw the movie in the theater twice. I just rented the dvd and I believe several scenes have been shortened from how they were in the original movie. The scenes that seemed shorter are:Alice being caught trying on the jewelryThe wedding- the original movie showed more of the wedding ceremony. (I'm not a dumb american that can only watch a tourist version of an indian movie, so i really don't appreciate the cutting here)scenes when the family mentor is accused of child molestation"
4,i love this movie!,"This was the first movie in Hindi and English that captured a full house in our local cinema and most of the audience was not Indian. I love the music and it captures the moods and ambience of upper class Delhi with humor and graceI keep on buying it and loaning it out and then having to buy it again because people decide they can't part with it.I also love Mississippi Masala and Namesake, also by the same director and Salaam Bombay (Oscar contender)her movies are atmospheric and showcase all aspects of Indian culture for the western audience"
4,"gorgious movie, watch out for the sexual assault stuff","a beautiful movie. the crazyness surrounding an indian wedding, the importance of family and at the same time, all the crzy things going on behind the scenes that people dont talk about: messing arund w the ex, child molestation, the abcd factor of 1 guy, all kinds of things. i especially lve the story of dubey and alice, they are so cute!!!! beware though if you dont like talk of molestation and rape, they make it very emotional near the end of the movie, thats a warning."
5,"Wonderful, rich, uplifting","Monsoon Wedding is a rich, warm, colorful, lavish, hilarious, and deeply moving gift from Mira Nair to the audience. An utterly delightful web of family relationships is woven through the movie, centering around an arranged wedding (in Texas!). But that's just the central theme. Almost more interesting is the sub-story of a romance developing between a servant girl and the opportunistic, marigold-eating (??? What is THAT all about ??) wedding-planner.Super-duper. Even my 90yo father loved it!"
1,boring and pointless,"I guess I have to be in the right mood to see a movie like this, but I could not stay interested in it at all. I liked movies such as Gosford Park, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, etc. But those movies usually had interesting characters, plot intrigue, and some humor mixed in to keep the movie upbeat at least a little. This movie had none of that. I did not care about any of the characters. It was mostly depressing (when not boring) and the sporadic use of subtitles was annoying and distracting. The plot was straightforward-almost like a documentary. My wife did not care for this film either so I am truly astounded by all the positive reviews. I would pass on this one."
1,It makes you Mourn Soon,"Well Monsoon Wedding oops did i say Mourn Soon Wedding...I thought movie lacked conviction and that reflects in its inept screen play, jarring editing and made up performances!!!!Mira Nair the Inter-Nationally Renowned Director ya ""inter-nationally"" does a Sooraj Bharjatiya with a C rate southern soft porn flickGod help me getting married if i were to go by the definition by Ms. NairWell with festivals round the corner i am being kind enough to give it one star which too it does not merit"
5,Best movie I have ever seen! And I watch many movies!,"If you are not a movie nut or if you are one...this movie is a MUST see! I fell in love with India, it's music, the culture...I want to go there, now. It made me laugh, it made me cry, I could not pull away from it. I had watched the movie five times before getting a copy! GET THE SCORE....it is fabulous!"
4,the 'subplot' is the best part,"the small sweet thing between alice and dubey is surreal and nice and real and fantastic all at once. I especially like the character Dubey. I think he is by far the best actor in the movie. Comfortably eating marigolds, fighting, talking on the phone, going home, finally dancing. I thought more could have been done with the boy from australia and the cute girl. I somewhat agree about the forced nature of ""the bad thing,"" though it leads to a very good scene between the father and that girl. Overall, the movie is a great spectacle, lots of energy and color and all that stuff. Not corny like Kama Sutra was. (was that her movie?? not sure.) The soundtrack is wonderful, too."
5,"Funny, delightful, upbeat, yet it felt real","This is a movie about a wedding in modern India. By the time the movie ended -- much too soon -- I felt I knew these people. More than that, I wanted to meet them and be their friend. Despite a couple of dark moments, the overall tone is very upbeat. Wonderful images of the country and an ancient and astonishing culture."
3,"Cool Music, but a bit slow","Had some of the best bollywood music i have heard. Chunari Chunari is the BEST Indian Pop Song!!!.. I also loved the sub-plots. Makes me want to get caught in a monsoon in India and be washed away by the rain. A bit slow moving, however. The music however, is the best! One of my favorite Bollywood films!"
2,One chick-flick with curry coming up!,"Women will love this Indian film (half in English/half in sub-titles) about women and their friends, loves, fiances, families, children, emotions and relationships, relationships, and more relationships. Nothing happens but a wedding. Anyone who has ever gone to a large ethnic family wedding and get-together will experience Deja-vu. Guys will find this about as interesting as an Oprah re-run starring Dr. Phil and filmed in Bombay. Predictable and boring. Left me thinking, ""So what?"" The music is a mix of Indian and Western dance music and is lively, though. You can skip this one unless you loved ""Beaches""."
3,overhyped,"Ok, maybe im no expert in Indian cinema, and this marks some kind of crossover milestone or something, but as a film its seriously overated.watchable in a kind of mike leigh lite style, but overall pretty unsubstantial.theres nothing wrong with the film, and if your looking for an insight into modern indian family life amogst the wealthy and their servants then im sure youll find something here, but thers not a lot more."
2,Not really an interesting film.. don't expect much...,"Went with really high expectations seeing all this positive reviews. It is completely disappointing.Being from India, I didn't find this movie interesting at all. I completely agree with another reviewer that it completely inaccurate portrayal of Indian culture and lacking originality. There are too many characters in the film."
3,Expected a little more thunder.,"It's fun but Mira Nair hasn't been able to find her step since the phenomenal success of ""Salaam Bombay."" The acting is very natural, the cinematography is gorgeous, and you get a modern portrait of India, rather than some bloated view of its colonial past. There are lots of witty lines and it is a good story that pulls you along, but somehow it doesn't quite come together in the way I had hoped. Mira rather deftly handles the ""family secret."" But, she floods the screen with incidental characters, rather than reveal the deeper layers of her main characters. Fortunately, the actors convey a lot with their gestures."
5,Great Scent!,"The Elizabeth Arden Provocative Woman scent has intoxicating base scents - orchids, freesia, amber, and lotus. The combination of all of these scents makes this scent one of Elizabeth Arden's best. I believe the scent is being phased out though because I am finding it more and more difficult to find it in ""full"" Department Stores. I found the perfume on amazon and then found the lotion.I love this lotion because it helps to layer my scent as well as moisturize my skin. Thankfully, the lotion isn't greasy or too scent-heavy. Sometimes, I just wear the lotion and I still get a lot of compliments.The lotion is a must have - even if you don't own the perfume."
5,Alexis Vogel Instruction DVD,"This item was shipped very quickly. I don't have the makeup kit, but the instructional DVD is very educational and helpful. Thank you for a great product. Jamie W."
1,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this DVD. I was told by a friend to get it for instruction--I am a Licensed Esthetician and I take makeup classes and review DVD's etc. to learn about makeup techniques. There was very little content to this DVD--was really just more of a sales pitch--no real quality. Additionally I feel it is a little dated.
2,Sateen Sheets,The sheets were a good quality material. The thing that I didn't like about them is when I washed them they shrunk. The top sheet is too small to tuck in
4,I love sleepy time!,"Since I've bought these sheets, I just love sleeping. Besides the fact the thread count is so high, it wrinkles easily, you have to iron them after every wash. Great Buy!"
3,Not as soft as expected,"These are nice sheets, but for 1,000 thread count I would expect it to feel much softer (just like butter). Even after washing it with fabric softener, it is still not as soft as I anticipated."
2,Need a bit more info,"While this book compiles information in an easy-to-use format, I am concerned about the lack of some very important information. As noted in the other review, there is no dosing information. The authors also don't list botanical names, which can lead people to use the wrong plant, or a species of the plant with little medicinal value. Lastly, none of the recipes or herb descriptions explain which part of the herb to use. This will make a good quick reference once I know a bit more about what I am doing, but is not a good beginner's book."
3,Clancy bro,"I purchased this cd with a view of working on some of them for the band. Other than The Rising of the Moon, I am quite dissapointed by the rest of the Cd.Billy"
5,Gift for Daughter in Law,My Daughter in law in certainly interested in Ayurveda and wants to know as much about it as possible. She thinks this book will have some very good information.
3,Oldies But Goodies - Blues?,"Here it is folks...an oldies but goodies greatest hits of blues guitarists! Some of the greats play some of their serious compositions. You'll recognize the styles and some of the selections. Try it, you shouldn't be disappointed. From down here in Chalmette, cya!"
1,The fighting scenes are stiff and look obviously fake. The acting is awkward.,"The fighting scenes are stiff and look obviously fake. The acting is awkward. In short, this is not a good movie of Chow Yun Fat."
2,it was egh,"I gave it two stars because while I didn't hate it, it was dull and predictable. I see beter plots on TV's Starsky and Hutch. It probably wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't have to use subtitles; I found myself more interested in looking at the text than watching the movie. I know, that's only my opinion, but I watch a lot of DVD's and I think I know what I like and don't like."
3,"Film Yes, DVD No","""Full Contact"" ranks high on the list of classic Hong Kong ""heroic bloodshed"" action films. Grittier and more extreme than John Woo's films (more gore and maimings, and characters who are less noble), it's an entertaining ride, and a good showcase for the always-magnetic Chow Yun-Fat. Unfortunately, this DVD re-release has a serious problem -- the actual video print is a big improvement on the original Tai Seng release, but whole chunks of soundtrack seem to be missing from the Chinese audio track (strangely enough, they're present on the English audio track). If you don't mind watching your Hong Kong movies in English, this is a good buy, but if you're a purist, you're better off sticking with the original Tai Seng DVD for the complete Chinese audio track."
2,Close but no cigar,"I would have given this book a much higher rating if Reichert hadn't folded at the end and advocated Ferber's Cry-It-Out method. For most of the book the author admits to being a loving, nurturing parent. She doesn't let her kids cry; she co-sleeps; she has a lot of attachment parenting behaviors. However, in the interest of not making waves, she opens her arms to the more militant Ferber approach. Sorry, but I can't condone that and I wish she wouldn't have.Other than that a couple of her chapters are very good--like the ones entitled Temperament, The Generation Gap, and Half a World Away.This book just ends up saying: Babies are going to wake up; don't fret over it; do whatever you want to deal with it. Man, it could have been a much better book if she had stuck with what she does instead of what she hears about what other people do. (She refers a lot to polls that were taken in cahoots with her magazine, Today's Parent.)"
1,Definitely for ART students.,If your objective in carving is to let the rock express its deepest desires then by all means buy this book. If not then get a book that will actually teach you how to carve stone.
2,The Wind Done Gone,"I have a hard time understanding why there was so much controversary over the release of a parody on Gone With the Wind which was, of course, fiction. Although this was written from the opposite view point of Margaret Mitchell's novel, and I suppose the purpose was to tell the same story with the other view, so much of the story line did not match up. Over all, I reallly did not think much of the story even though I positively agree that the slave's lot was horrible and they existed solely for the pleasure and purpose of the whites."
2,Could Have Done Without This One!,"Being a huge fan of Gone With the Wind, I had to read this alternative account of the story. And let me tell you, it is a completely alternative account! Only a small percentage of the story seemed consistent with the characters developed in Margaret Mitchell's novel. Some parts were downright bawdy and indecent--unnecessarily, I thought. The book redeems itself a bit by shedding some light on some curious situations in GWTW...for instance, why all three of Gerald's sons died in infancy. It also explores, seemingly authentically, the psychological effects of servants raising the children born into an aristrocratic life. Other than that--skip it. I think the concept behind the book is wonderful, but could have been done MUCH better."
1,Wind done WRONG,"While this book is clearly intended to be a paradoy of GONE WITH THE WIND it tips its hand a little too far. It appears that this woman who we are supposed to believe was a Black Slave has a strange pull toward the Slave Masters... on about page five she suggests that Union Troops would not ""save a slave"".. WRONG. Many slaves were saved by Union Troops.Indeed liberated slaves lined the streets to cheer the Union Troops as the heroes and deliverers they were.This woman doesn't portray a SLAVE who ever knew the WHIP or the CHAIN but the kind of slave portrayed in the Real GONE WITH THE WIND: simpering wimpering and clinging to ""de ol mastah"".I thought we were past that LIE.A mess and any true ex slaves would be ashamed."
1,The Wind Done Gone Truly Blows,"While I believe that the issues Randall claims to be addressing in her literary parody of Margaret Mitchell's epic novel should be explored, I feel Randall lacks the craft as a novelist to ""explode"" the myths created and generally embraced by the collective consciousness of those who've read Gone With the Wind or seen the derivative film."
1,Afrocentric Revisionist Fantasy,"As a historian and Gone with the Wind fan, I found this book very disappointing. The book seems to imply that the slaves were really running everyone's lives. I can't believe I was tricked into reading this book. No wonder the estate of Margaret Mitchell sued. What a waste."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,There is so much hype surronding this book so I thought I would try it. I am sorry I did. I love Gone With the Wind and this is a slap in the face to Ms. Mitchell's work. I am sorry the judge didn't prevent the publication. If you have a few hours to waste then this book is for you but I don't recommend it to anyone.
1,Wish I had never read this book.,"I picked up this book after hearing all of the controversy over whether or not it should be published. It should never have gotten published I thought it was awful. If she ever decides to write another ""novel"" maybe Ms. Randall can come up with her own ideas instead of working off of another author's book. Don't bother with this book."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME SUGAR,I am an African American fan of the Gone With the Wind book and Tape. This book was such an extreme waste of my time and energy. It is paper thin and usually for me this would be an afternoon read...it took two weeks. I kept reading it because I really wanted it to get better. I was severely and sincerely disappointed. YUCK!
2,"Literature...Not At Its Best, Perhaps","Although having read it years ago, I was never really a die-hard 'fan' so to speak, of the whole saga of Tara and GWTW, and especially the romantic 'allure' of it. Therefore, having no expectations along these lines, I'd still have to say that unfortunately, this book was just very poorly written.There are many components which make truly great 'literaure' what it is. The Wind Done Gone, (in my own opinion...of course) was rather lacking across the board in areas such as: voice clarity and consistency throughout the story, sentence structuring, plotting, story pacing, etc., etc.On any level of reading, I think it could be safely said, that it wasn't an easy read -- and not a very good one either. However, I did like the concept Alice Randall seemed to have in mind when writing this story, so I am very open to reading other works from her in the future."
2,A very quick read,"It took me 4 to 5 hours to finish this book. The writing style is simple, the plot is thin and the characters are shallow and uncomplicated. Familiarity with GWTW is required since this book could not possibly stand on it's own. It is a vindictive answer to GWTW evidenced in Scarlet's demise and Rhett's emasculation, not a parody. I always considered GWTW silly and melodramatic so I eagerly anticipated this book knocking it down a few pegs. I was interested in another person's interpretation of GWTW, unfortunately the book itself is uninteresting."
3,"Interesting, but flawed...","I think many people have jumped the gun on this book, thinking it is a sequel or something of that nature to Gone with the Wind. And it definatly isn't that. I have to say that this book is something that should've been written. I will give the author credit for that insite. It also has some good entertainment value. It is humourous at times and give good perspective on lives on the other side of the original story. I gave it only three stars because, first, some of the details in this book do not go along with GWTW. Secondly, as a warning, if you haven't read GWTW, it will not make much sense. All in all, it really is a good read."
2,Very slow read...,"I am accustomed to slow moving novels, but this one takes the cake. I am familiar with ""Gone With the Wind"" and I had to go out and rent it again just to keep the characters in the book straight. I think it was a good attempt to chronicle the ""other side"" of the hallmark in American film/ literature, but, it leaves alot to be desired. I had to force myself to read when I was in the bathtub and that is usually my favorite book reading place!!! Historically, I think it was a perspective that few people have had the opportunity to see. Even with that said, I would not recommend this book to anyone who has a average to short attention span."
1,I gave it a chance,"To the point; The plot is boring, the herione is boring, the storyline and characters are not believable. Total waste of money. And a disgrace to a wonderful piece of american liturature. I am willing to read a parody, spin off, or background story based off of Mitchell's GWTW. However, Ms. Randal did a poor job and wasted good paper on this flop. She could have made this story MUCH better."
3,Worth a Read,"You have to know your Margaret Mitchell to keep up with this one, which is well written and always interesting twist on the GTWT legend. While the author doesn't wish her work to necessarily be entertaining (she prefers ""disturbing""), the plot twists are fun and it's always a pleasure to revisit beloved characters...even when the author takes liberties."
1,Tedious to listen to and hard to follow,"I listened to all the controversy about this book,laughed out loud at the clever name, and was hoping for some insight into the minor characters or parody of the story told in the novel. Instead, Cindy, the mulatto half-sister, the protagonist of this story, does not seem to exist in her own right, only in how she relates to and resents the novels' privileged characters. It was difficult to follow the relationships (To be fair, I listened to, rather than read this book.) Cindy's diary gradually reveals the true story behind her sale and earns her mother, Mammy, the respect she deserves. She attains, then disdains, what the ""Other"" coveted. Only in the end, as she develops a relationship with the colored congressman, is the story unpredictable and Cindy developed, at least a bit, as a character in her own right."
4,Thought Provoking,"Thought provoking insight into the ""other side"" of Gone with the Wind. The diary format made for a quick read, however, it limited the insight into characters other than the writer. If you liked Gone With the Wind (the book, not the movie!), you must read this."
1,far-fetched,"this book is horrible!, if you are a fan of,"" gone with the wind,"" ( or not,) this book is a yawner from the start. Talk about your mealy-mouth characters! they seem to be all here. Especially cynara? or cindy(what the heck is the name anyway) A truly one-dimensional character that will bore the hell out of you."
1,What Can I Say ?,"I've just finished this book, and I'm now racking my brain for at least one good thing to say in its favor. Unfortunately--I'm really coming up empty here. What was Ms. Randall thinking, and why was her editor obviously ""asleep at the wheel"" when deciding to take this story on after she wrote it?? Some of the writing appears to be in some sort of an erratic ""code,"" that the reader has been duly charged to decipher.I originally thought a book like this would tell a ""different"" kind of story, and ultimately be a great read. But after reading a wonderful book like ""Cane River,"" this one is a true disappointment."
3,Glad the wind is let out of Gone With the Wind,"The controversy around the printing is what attracted me to this book as much as my hatred of Gone With the Wind. The Wind Done Gone was hard to read due to fairly constant changes in writing style (formal to informal to almost speaking in tongues). I found the story haunting and disturbing. I wanted to put it down but the story wouldn't allow me that peace. I cannot say it is my favorite book or really recommend it to anyone who thinks the souths past is romantic, but if you want a little realism in your life this is the book for you."
2,"Novel, But Blah","I really wanted to like this book. The synopsis described the book as having the elements of a really juicy read. However, I found the book to be rushed in places and somewhat trite overall.While I did not expect it to have the exact same literary style as Gone With The Wind, I did expect the book to have more substance."
1,Boo!,"It is compeletly a piece of trash! This so-called ""author"" doesn't know how to write. A 3 year old could write this book!"
1,gone with the facts,"This is another sad example of revisionism in the PC age. The author just doesn't seem to get the fact that GWTW is a work of ""fiction"" set in the civil war south. She treats the book as if it were a recent treatise promoting racism. DONE GONE is a terribly misguided attempted to ""set the record"" straight about the role of black females in 19th century America. Randall needs to do a lot more thinking and researching before attempting to do that. About the only thing this book will do is expand her bank account. It certainly will not expand society's understanding of the hard road people of color--females and males alike--have had to traverse. This book just promotes literary censorship!"
1,The Last Thing You Want To Read,"The Wind Done Gone was supposed to be a parody to Gone With the Wind. Not only did it disappoint me, but it disgusted me. Randall completely alters Scarlett's whole existence, saying that she was born half African American, and the this new character, just ""added in,"" was Rhett's lover. It is a joke of a book with no connection to Gone With The Wind besides the sticker on the front that claims its connection. I would not recommend buying this, or even borrowing it from your local library. It was a waste of my time to read. With the confusing timeline (or lack thereof) and the messy family trees (most of which did not even line up with each other), I cannot even fathom why anyone would publish this book."
1,Do not waste your time!!!,"Do not read this book, it is a waste of time! The slaves in GWTW are not potrayed as stupid people. GWTW is about a women living in the South before, during, and after the Civil War. I'm sorry, but there used to be slaves. It is a part of history, and no one can change that. Margaret Mitchell could not change that, so of course she is going to include slaves in a book about the civil war. It is rude of the author of The Wind Done Gone to use the characters from GWTW and turn them into something they're not."
1,Very poorly done,"This book really wasn't worth all the fuss that it got in the press - good or bad. I'm not sure what Ms. Randall was trying to accomplish by writing this book. It was very poorly written; the main character's thoughts jumped all over the place that the reader can't really follow them and understand the point - if there is one - that's being made. Cynara is supposed to be an intelligent person with intelligent thoughts, and I don't see that in this writing.Maybe Ms. Randall could have done a much better job of explaining plantation life from a slave's point of view if she hadn't tried to focus so much on Gone With the Wind. Her fascination with GWTW is distracting, particularly to one who has read it. As a result, I noticed alarming parallels with her phrases and settings to Ms. Mitchell's work, and see an individual taking credit and making money off of someone else's original work. It's a shame, particularly when the work in question isn't anything to be proud of."
1,Poorly written,This book is poorly written and contains no plot at all. This is just a politically correct attempt to defame one of the greatest novels of all time. This book shouldn't be on the same shelf as Gone With the Wind. Don't waste your money on this so called parody.
2,Just not believable,"I've read ""Gone With The Wind"" SO many times (a dozen would not be an exaggeration), and Gerald O'Hara (Scarlett's father) just did not strike me as the lascivious type, a man who fathered children with slaves. This is a man who was SO much in love with his wife, Ellen, that he lost his mind after she died of typhoid fever during the Civil War. Moreover, from the description of Mammy in Margaret Mitchell's novel, she was hardly a temptress in the Sally Hemings mold...not even in her younger days!The book just isn't believable and I agree with the one Southern reader. I'm not a prude, but it's TOO trashy."
3,"Brilliant Concept, Poorly executed","I really wanted to like this book. It's a great concept, and long overdue. Unfortunately, Ms. Randall's writing doesn't measure up to her concept; she might have fared better had she written this as a third-person narrative rather than a diary, since the latter is a tricky device to master for a first novel. (Oh, if only Alice Walker had thought up this idea!) Still worth a read though, and she raises some important issues...I recommend you get this one at the library, and purchase a copy of A SHINING THREAD OF HOPE: BLACK WOMEN IN AMERICA by Darlene Clark Hine instead."
3,"ENJOYABLE, BUT TOO BRIEF","The author could have added another couple of hundred pages. I enjoyed what I read, but I also agree this is not parody nor is it a masterpiece. I saw the author in person. Not only does she have an ego as large as Tara, she was way too serious over a fictional account of the old south. I enjoyed Gone With the Wind for what it was: a sprawling love story about a witch named Scarlet who eventually did get her comeuppance. ROOTS told the whole truth about what slavery really was like. Enough already."
4,"A quick, good read",Sometimes you read a book or see a movie and you wonder about the lives of the characters when they are not involved with the plot of the book. This book adds depth to characters that we are already familiar with. I liked the book and the writing style very much.
2,Alice must be kidding!,"Long a lover of Gone With The Wind, I was most anxious to read this ""parody"" of that most loved book. I quickly bought from Amazon.com, receiving the book very soon. First, I was astonished at the size, only 210 pages, with very wide margins, all this in a 6 X 8 1/2 inch book. (Heck, I can write longer letters than this....) But as I read I went from interest to sheer boredom, very quickly. The idea was wonderful, but Ms Randall missed the boat by making it so short. She should have developed the characters, and should have provided so much more to her readers.Much sturm and drang about Mammy, not enough about ""Other"", nor ""R"", too much about ""Garlic""... Come on, Alice! You can do better than this! Sit down and rewrite the thing, only this time spend a bit of time!Summation: Much ado about nothin'!"
1,"Go on Wind, BE Gone","The Wind done Gone is a good way to describe this story. I am no fan of Gone with the Wind and I know this was supposed to be the untold story, but I couldn't follow this story at all. Lady, Planter,Cynara, Corinne, whoever else, I could not get straight. Cinnamon and R, What? Honestly I think that you have to be a real Gone with the Wind fan to understand the story of The Wind Done Gone. Maybe a publishing of the original diaries may help, or maybe if Alice Randall would have changed the dialect and made it more of a story form, than a diary setting, I may have understood it better. If you are a history buff orvery curious as to why they fought to publish this story, you may be intrigued by its contents, unfortunately it left too many questions for me, oh and mind you I am not a fan of Gone with the Wind."
1,"Frankly, my dear,... this book ain't worth it!","I just finished reading TWDG and may I say how SORELY disappointed I was! I had such high expectations! Especially considering that some people had paid hundreds of dollars for this book on eBay before it went into mass publication. The writing style leaves something to be desired as the main character, Cynara, always asks seemingly inane questions about things only to ask even more questions for answers! It seems everything in this book was mainly ""Is it this...or this is it?"", ""Do I do this...or do I do that?"" and it goes on like that for 200+ pages. I do give Ms. Randall points for the main concept but the execution was terrible. Better luck next time!"
4,Laugh out loud funny,"I am a huge fan of ""Gone With The Wind"" and as soon as I heard about this book, I knew I had to have it. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. I laughed so hard at some moments I almost cried. It was fascinating to read about such classic characters from someone else's perspective. To find out that I was not the only one who thought Ashley was a bit too much of a dandy was hilarious. Thank you so much Alice Randall for giving us fans something new to talk about."
3,schizophrenic,"The author and the main character both have a real love/hate relationship with all that is Gone With the Wind. I found Randall's tale of the flip-side of Tara incredibly provocative and thorough, but wondered why both she, and the mulatto mistress Cynara, were so fascinated with all things Confederate. Scathing hatred mixed with nostalgia and remorse are what I read in TWDG. In general, Randall writes too well to be in the company of such worthless fiction as Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett, and with too much depth and self-awareness for Margaret Mitchell. This is not a book for the readers of GWTW who were fans of the Rhett and Scarlett ""romance"", but for readers who were critics of GWTW, fascinated by the racial slip and slide that was antebellum and Reconstruction America."
4,"There's Always the ""Other"" Side of the Story","This is just absolutley WONDERFUL! They say it's a parody but I think it is an eye-opening, mind-bending, thought provoking probable truths of the other side of the story(ies) that are only beginning to be told.Alice Randall takes us to some dark places in this country's--perhaps world's past. Yet, none of it is surprising, just THE beautiful harsh cold reality.Well done! Thanks and PEACE to Ms. Randall."
4,Original and eloquent,"I bought this volume in a gift shop at the Oak Alley Plantation in Louisiana. How utterly fitting. What I expected was a biting satire. What I got instead is a lovely, lyrical book that could virtually stand alone, but is so much more rewarding in context. Ashley, those red-haired twins, Prissy--they're all here. I can't help but wonder what Olivia DeHaviland would make of it, especially her character, Mealy Mouth.Ms. Randall makes her point, taking characters in direction I never would have expected, just as Margaret Mitchell did so many years before."
3,A different look,Ms. Randall's characters were quite interesting. I quickly read the book and I thought that all the hype it's getting isn't justified. It was entertaining however.
1,not what i thought it would be,"ok first off i didn't finish the book but so far i am very disappointed in this book. yes gone with the wind was very one sided and sugar coated the slave days, I'm not disputing that. But this lady has ruined some great characters, like Mammy. Mammy would never have slept with Gerald, let alone had a child with him. She was a very proud person and thought Gerald to be below her, she work in the house of Royalty. Plus she basically Raised Ellen, she loved her like a daughter. So that right there has ruined the book for me. She jumps around a lot and it gets confusing. Also i was horrified when I read the bit about her being in the room with Rhett the night Bonnie died. That little girl was his life, I am just going to leave it there. I wouldn't suggest this book unless you really didn't care about the gone with the wind characters."
4,Interesting,"Since I have NEVER seen ""Gone With The Wind,"" I don't get all of the controversy. But the book was still very interesting."
1,This book is absolute garbage!,"This book is nothing more than an excuse to bring up the issue of slavery. What happened happend and ther is no person alive that can change it. The writer atempted to write a book, but could not get any good ideas so she decided to trash a classic. It wants to be a parody, but from the book being written in the slave's point of view, I think it is trashy and unnacceptable."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I picked this up based on the ""Unauthorized Parody"" sign on the cover - ridiculous, as the author of GWTW has been dead for decades. This pathetic book takes everything fine about GWTW and sullies it. In her author description in the dust jacket, Randall says she wondered about the mulatto children of Tara. Perhaps there weren't any! Poorly written and contributing nothing at all to the body of American literature, this book is a sad waste of time."
1,Inane garbage!,"I went to see this woman speak at The Margaret Mitchell House, where she was graciously invited and treated very well. She was incredibly rude, UN-gracious and really beyond description. For instance, when asked if she knew of Margaret Mitchell's aid to African American students during her life, she refused to acknowledge the speaker. She cannot validate her views, therefore ignores anything to the contrary. Now is that not censorship on her part? I also find her book is without value at all. She has dregged up all kinds of lame, inaccurate views of GWTW and seeks to make money off of some one else's talents. (Mitchell's). I not in agreement with the censorship of her book, or censorship in general. But after meeting this woman in person I can understand how the keepers of Ms. Mitchell's estate had valid reasons for their suit. She is an embarassment to the people she claims to vindicate. Even if all this weren't true, the book isn't even any good!"
2,What's all the fuss?,"If the estate of Margaret Mitchell had not made so much noise about this book, no one would know it existed. Pick it up and read a few pages. It is not a parody, it is a joke. Save your money and get this one from the library if you have to read it. It's episodic and lacks a narrative with any continuity. Don't look to fall in love with any of the characters."
1,Should never have been printed.,"The judge that allowed this disaster to lift ideas and outright quotes from Gone With the Wind should be kicked from the bench. A no talent writer with an axe to grind is a pitiful read. I thought the authorized sequel stunk, but this is much worse. This book was a gift, but it went into the trash."
1,I don't even know why I'm wasting my time...,"Yes, actually I do. To warn potential readers from reading the most crappy book in the face of the Earth.Gerald betraying his adored Ellen?Mammy betraying her most loved mistress?Ashley being gay? (Since when is dereaming gayness? And didn't he love Melanie?)Melanie killing a slave out of anger? (This offended me the most, because I have always loved Melanie)Rhett prefering this lame loser wannabe to Scarlett?It's an insult to GWTW.An insult to Margaret Mitchell. An insult to the south.Just because some plantations had mullattos doesn't mean everyone had to.If you have read GWTW, don't let this horrible, disgusting object cheat you out of your time, or your love for one of the most beautiful books of American literature."
5,Enjoy This Book on Many Levels,"The Wind Done Gone is a book to be appreciated and enjoyed on many levels. It is, first of all, a subtle literary parody which, in my opinion, will make any thoughtful reader reconsider assumptions about the history and myth of the antebellum South. At the same time, The Wind Done Gone can be read as a short novel that intrigues one as it flows from an arresting beginning to an effective and satisfying denouement. The narrative moves effortlessly, and certain lyrical passages can be savored for the language alone. Regardless of which aspect appeals, you will not be the same after you have read this book."
2,Alice Randall either didn't read GWTW or has a short memory.,"GWTW fans all know that Scarlett's father,Gerald O'Hara, was not the ""Captain"". He wasmerely ""Mr. O'Hara"", even to his wife, Ellen.The Captain was, of course, the dashing RhettButler, Scarlett's third husband.Aside from a few general errors, the bookcould have been a great comedy. Unfortunately,it survives as another mediocre novel that tookitself too seriously. But that is only my opinion,and I could be wrong."
3,A MISSED OPPORTUNITY,"When I first heard about the impending publication of ""The Wind Done Gone,"" I was excited. At last, a book was on the horizon that would somewhat debunk the images of the Old South. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.Well, I have finished Randall's book and, sad to say, this is not the book that ""repaired"" Mitchell's fantasy. Slow in pacing, confusingly organized, and hurt by the first person narrative style, the novel, like others have stated, is not a true parody. It is, however, one to be read and discussed for it does present another perspective, albeit, like the original, the ""view"" is slightly flawed.A better ""parody"" is the classic skit from the ""Carol Burnett Show"" entitled ""Went with the Wind."" Vicki Lawrence's turn as ""Cissy,"" the slave who ""knows nothing about birthin' no babies"" had more bite than Randall's novel.I was hoping for more from this one."
2,What a waste of a great idea!,"I grew up in the South and with family members who love GWTW, but I always was 'just ok' with it, and its handling of slavery was one of the turn-offs for me. So I was very excited about this book. I kept laughing to myself just at the funny title. But it's soooooo disappointing. What a ridiculous plot. What a golden opportunity not only missed by a thousand miles but trampled upon until unrecognizable. Heck, it almost inspires me to try my hand at a version of GWTW from the slaves' POV just because I want one so badly -- a GOOD one, not a dumb one like this. What a letdown. This book is what Rhett calls Ashley in the original novel: ""Dead Sea fruit"" -- ""something that appears to be beautiful or full of promise but is in reality nothing but illusion and disappointment"" (Dictionary.com)."
2,An Opportunity Wasted,"I understand parody to contain humor of some fashion - there is nothing humorous about self-conscious, bad writing. Were we supposed to roll over laughing, holding our sides, at the conceit of calling Rhett Butler ""Debt Chauffeur?"" I hope not, because it's only an unsatisfying use of a thesaurus. Alice Randall had some interesting premises here: The idea that Ashley may have had a male lover in his past, or that Ellen O'Hara may have had a black person in hers... This could have been fascinating and such a page-turner, but in Randall's hands it's just self-satisfied show.I would have been thrilled to read a version of Gone with the Wind from the perspective of the slaves on the plantation. I'm a big fan of everything GWTW and have enjoyed, to some degree, all of the works that take the story as their starting point. Unfortunately, using it just to get publicity for a book which would never have been published without the connection is a disservice to reader, and other writers."
1,Disappointed,"I hurried to the store as soon as the book hit the shelves. I could not wait to read this book, boy what a disappointment. The book was awful plain and simple."
1,Terribly disappointing,"Being a huge GWTW fan, I felt compelled to read TWDG. I was looking forward to it, but was sorely disappointed. I was looking forward to the story told from the point of view of the slaves, which seemed like an interesting way to write this novel. The character of Cynara is nothing more than a mulatto version of Scarlett O'Hara, strong and independent, but also spoiled, indulged and self-absorbed.There was nothing new or revealing in this book, just a jumbled, disappointing mess."
1,A poor imitation of the real thing,"I am so glad that I checked this book out from the library instead of spending my money. The idea was unique but the result was boring. Cynara was a poor imitation of Scarlett when she could have been so much more. Instead of focusing on her life she mostly talked about the white characters who for obivious reasons could not be named. Her affair with ""R"" was pointless and dull. I never really learned anything about Cynara and frankly after 50 or so pages I did care if I did or didn't. Overall the only thing that Ms. Randall did do was reaffirm my adamiration for the real classic. Despite its unflattering portrayal of African Americans Gone With The Wind is an incredible AND orginal novel."
1,Decent but whiny,"While Ms. Randall shows much promise and nerve, this novel comes off as a whining (at times) bore. Cindy is so wrapped up in her jealousy for ""other"" she makes it her sole purpose in life to one-up ""other"". Ms. Randall could have really done something had she given the main character more of her own identity, rather than conforming to ""other""."
2,Disappointment,"When I buy a VHS or a DVD of a concert or of a music festival I want to see the band(s) that is playing and listen to the whole song(s). This movie is mostly the movie of what's going around the stage, not on top of it. Because this movie is not focused on the music the sound is poor. So if you want to see the carnival around the Glastonbury music festival this is your movie, not mine."
5,CD,"While not what I expected, I like her singing and the CD arrived quickly and in good condition. I am happy with this purchase."
5,The Jane Morgan Collection,"This lady gave me a love for music and theater when I was just a little girl. Not a day goes by that something doesn't remind me of some lyric in one of her songs. I don't think she died in 1974 ... I really don't think she died ... A pure, sweet voice ... and a lovely, gracious, beautiful woman. Someone tell me she didn't die."
5,good enough!,Easy to install. Maybe a little more dim than my standard one on the other side. Cops don't bother me about busted headlight anymore.
3,head light,took a while to get product but was accurate and did get some of my money back for it take almost two weeks
5,Selling Power Booster,"If you want a power boost for your selling success, ""PowerSelling"" is a turbocharged resource for you. Just as with his first book ""Wise Moves"", George Ludwig uses his brilliant nack for reducing selling complexity into easy to read practical tips. As a sales person, consultant, and sales trainer, I recommend this as a must read for every sales professional."
5,"Take it to the next level with ""Power Selling""!","I have been in the Financial Services Industry for 20 years in capacities of recruiter, trainer, producer, teacher, manager, and author. Mr George Ludwig has topped the crowd head and shoulders with this book! His depth of insight regarding powerful keys to cracking the code are going to help my business tremendously. I highly recommend Power Selling to anyone who wants to ""take it to the next level"""
1,Wild December; disfunctional October,"I read this disfunctional book in October, or rather, I should say, I skimmed it in October. The book was so poorly written. The author randomly switches point of view, (The story is told mostly in third person and occasionally in first.) and the sentences are so disjointed, incomplete and fragmented that as a former English teacher I would have given the writer an F in grammer, and I couldn't get beyond the writing style. Did this book have an editor? Stringing a lovely bunch of adjectives together may establish atmosphere, but it does nothing to advance the story or entice the reader to keep turning the pages. I can't imagine what possessed me to buy this book, but, unfortunately, one of the reviews must have captured my imagination."
2,Size????,Love the sticker but before I buy it I want to know how big it is. No where on this page does it show the dimensions of the sticker.....
3,passable,"this cd is ok. parts of it are priceless (david hyde pierce and ""missus lounsbourogh goodby""), but other parts are skippable (""miss otis regrets is a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT, and ""make it another old fashioned please""). they are funny, but personally, i expected something a little more classic. however, if you are a cole porter fan, you are not going to want to miss the majority of this cd."
4,"Great word histories; lousy ""art""","I love words and gravitate towards books about them.Here the authors explore the backgrounds of a variety of words from ""paparazzi"" to ""teflon,"" ""silhouette"" to ""zugzwang."" Emphasis is on the mystery as well as the history of the words. Illustrations by Robert Moser, original wood carvings commissioned for this work, are sometimes macabre, always different. Much of the art work borders on the repulsive and the words aren't particularly unusual -- I found only 3 I didn't know and zugzwang was one of them.But their histories are fascinating and, after all, that's what the book is about. I just wish they'd concentrated on the words and left out the ""art"" entirely."
2,Total Disappointment,"As a senior citizen, I was glad to see someone write about active and ""not brain dead"" senior citizens. How disappointing!! I got about half way through a literally threw it away! Nothing seemed to happen, characters were slow developing and noting seemed to jive, including the front cover. If the dog in the book was a Westie, why a Jack Russell on the cover??? Go figure! I'm not sure I'll try another of the series, in fact I know I won't."
1,"For decoration, not music","The practice chanter looks nice (especially from a distance), even though it is not without flaws. However, as an instrument, it is just not acceptable. It sounds fair but the notes are off. I tried several times and it could not produce a correct scale. So no matter how nice it looks and how cheap it is, it has failed its primary function to play music. Not recommended."
1,Garbage,"There are few makers of bagpipes and practice chanters compared to most other wind instruments. As a result, everything bought for piping seems a bit more expensive than it would otherwise be e.g. the price of quality practice chanters. First of all, a beginner doesn't need a wooden chanter. They aren't played in a performance setting and are only used for fingering practice. Whether or not any wood practice chanter sounds better than a plastic version is irrelevant until the piper playing it knows how to care for it to stop it splitting. This is especially important when the practice chanter top is also made of wood. Naturally, this cheap piece of crap does have a wooden top. In short, spend the extra money on a quality polypenco (delrin) practice chanter and get started on the right foot."
1,Better off going to a professional,"The chanter was not tuned properly, and required at least a better quality reed and substantial tampering. I'd recommend going to a seasoned professional and looking into a product that they have experience using."
4,Good Price Good Quality,This is a Good Chanter the reed is not any good. You will want to invest into Gibson reeds they are much better. It is made from Good quality Wood. The finish is ok it had some runs though over spray. I am refinishing the chanter using a good quality tung oil. The mouth piece is made from plastic what you get in this price range. Simply put for the price you can not argue it is a good practice chanter. The shipper was fast will order from them again.
2,"Great for Decoration, Not for Playing","I had this chanter and used it for a few weeks before I had to buy a better one. It really is beautiful with the nice looking wood and metal scroll-work. However, real practice chanters are usually made of plastic (looks very similar to a clarinet). After I got through a few lessons, I found it very hard to get my fingers on the correct holes because I couldn't really feel them since the wood is so smooth. My teacher suggested a plastic one by Gibson- it was so much easier to play because of the slightly bigger holes and the fact that the holes are slightly recessed. I highly recommend finding a bagpipe teacher FIRST and having the teacher make a recommendation for a practice chanter. The good quality ones are still under $100 and definitely worth the investment!"
1,"Unreal, literally.","I am very disappointed with this cd, none of the songs are original recordings. Apparently after Lionel Ritchie left the group the remaining members decided to re-record all of the their hits without him & the result leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Without Lionel's voice they sound like crap & I wouldn't recommed this cd to anyone. All of the songs sound too ""pop"" compared to the original funk & soul sound they had with him. I give this cd a big thumbs down & a zero rating. Don't buy it!"
1,Not The Originals,"I made a big mistake by buying this cd before reading the other reviews on this site. Had I read them, I would have seen these weren't the original hit versions of the famous Commodores songs. They're close renditions, and not ""terrible"" but the bottom line is: when you buy a ""hits"" package, you expect the original hits."
5,Beautiful kitchen light,I purchased three of these Maxim Symphony light fixtures in oil rubbed bronze to replace the builders package shiny brass fixtures that were in the home when we bought it. I did some research on line and installed this light myself. I replaced a 3 light fixture with a 5 light fixture that hangs over the breakfast table in our kitchen. The table is a 44 inch round and the light is perfectly sized. I ordered through Lighting Direct. Their customer service is excellent.
4,AWESOME but not so great,"The intro to this DVD was kind of weird, and personally, i didn't get it, but who knows?, some might. There are many chapters in this DVD that I thought were funny, but it's not constant laughter for me, and my parents didn't think so either.For someone who really wants to laugh the whole time, I'd suggest Ellen: Here and Now. Ellen DeGeneres can really make me laugh the whole time! And I'm not just saying that cuz I'm a kid. She talks about a lot of stuff EVERYONE will enjoy. Kids and adults.Anyway, Seinfeld is funny, but not like others. I liked it a lot, but it's not my favorite."
3,used,What can you expect from a used product... The CD had scratches and the cover was pretty worn... decided not to give it as a gift because it looked like I found it in a thirft store.
2,The King of Stand Up Banality,"I thought the Seinfeld show was the best written sitcom next to The Simpsons, but this stand up act is drowning in banality. Al Franken jokingly likes to say, ""Comedians are truth tellers."" Seinfeld gives us the 'truth' in all its mind numbing detail. ""Airline peanut bags are too small, dig?"" And now the extended riff, ""so are airline booze bottles and bathrooms."" It's so funny 'cause it's true! ""When people go to the store they can never remember if they have enough milk."" He's holding up a mirror, man! ""New York cabbies are bad smelling foreigners and airport security guards are too fat."" Stick it to the man, Jerry! Small targets, small truths, and no jeopordized endorsement deals either. Two Stars for being a trailblazer and the best of what has become a very tired genre."
1,Not Really what I expected,"The reason I purchased the DVD was to hear ""more"" of Jerry Seinfeld's comedy. However, the majority of what I actually saw was not more than ""repeated jokes"" that Jerry either said in his comedy series or in his book ""seinlanguage"". I don't deny that some are new but most are repeated. If you have watched the series or read the book, you are not really missing much!"
2,He's been using the same material for 6 years!!!!,"seinfeld has been using the same material for 6 years now. how does he get away with it??? what is up with this guy. write some new stuff.. you untalented thick! that's right folks, just cashing in on the same old garbage. first the show, then the cd, now the video. what's next.. i'm gonna telll you for the last time.. again."
2,Two stars are too generous!,"Yeah, Seinfeld is somewhat funny, but during the nine years of his sitcom, he failed to introduce black actors and/or comedians. New York surely has blacks, and his show did not represent the presents of blacks in New York."
1,This is Comedy?,This is pure garbage. Nothing this man says is remotely funny. His voice is annoying. Didn't laugh once at this or at any of his seinfeld episodes. Did i mention that he is not funny?
5,"If you ever laughed at a Seinfeld gag, you will buy this","Even if you have the CD, get the DVD anyway. It must be taken from a different perfomance (multiple perfomances for a final show, ironic a bit?), as almost all of the killer lines (telling the doctor to go back to his office, for instance) are delivered just that little bit differently. And I don't care whate people say, after nine years, it's still pretty funny. The whole supermarket bit (especially the part about milk) is brilliant, and the doctor/drugstore segments never fail to crack me up. As a last hurrah to the show, you should by this DVD. And the CD. And the VHS. And tack on a copy of Seinlanguage as well."
3,It was okay,"I bought this dvd and watched it after watching one of Ellen's standup dvds. Maybe it would have been better had I not watched Ellen's first. I really like Jerry Seinfeld but my sister and I agreed, he just couldn't follow Ellen!"
4,Old school Jerry - lots of laughs!,"I got this DVD for my husband and I to listen to on a road trip. We laughed so hard over his commentary about kids Halloween costumes that my husband almost had to pull over to the side of the road! The opening skit was boring and unnecessary but Jerry delivered fun and relatable content that still makes you laugh so hard you can't see straight. The only reason I held back a star was his repeated use of ***damned which is personally offensive to us (I'd rather hear the ""f"" word, seriously) and that made it not-so family friendly with kids in the car. We still love Jerry and his hilarious perspective of the world we share. :)"
5,All Thumbs Up!,"Jerry Seinfeld is telling us for the last time(No Way)! We don't want it to be the last time! We want his material with out extremity. He's exorbitantly funny and indubitably merited for spectators' standing ovation, as in the show! Five stars are not plenty for this comedy virtuoso! Witty Seinfeld will be back any time!"
2,Not great,I didn't enjoy this very much. The beginning is pretty strange with all of these comedians at a grave site.
3,Not for fans of the TV show,"Seinfeld's jokes are all old, he's got no new material, but this is what the DVD is about - burying old material.The thing is, you can just listen to the audio, for his skill lies in his intonations, as his facial range is limited - this made the jokes funnier in the tv show but for stand up, its lame.If you haven't heard much of Seinfeld, then get this DVD. You won't regret it; his jokes are funny enough.Nothing much in the way of extras except for a short Q&A; which shows his skill in handling a crowd."
3,Jerry Seinfeld Live On Broadway,"The film was good, but it amounted to Jerry's stand up act from the hit show. The bits are all funny, bot there is no new material."
2,Seinfeld is never a great standup comedian,I have always found Seinfeld's humor is dry and a bit forced. This DVD further proved this point. No way we can compare him with Bill Cosby and Robin Williams. would not recommend this DVD.
4,Jerry Seinfeld - Live on Broadway - Funny Stuff.,"Jerry Seinfeld is good at being funny. This DVD doesn't let you down! He sees everyday things that we all notice and finds a way to make them funny. You'll often find yourself thinking ""That is so true!"" Another plus is the fact that Jerry doesn't swear at all which is always a difference when talking about stand up comdedians.The only minus i can think of is you can watch it once and then remember most of the jokes, which makes the next time you watch it not quite as funny. It's also missing the classic writing of Larry David and 3 other actors to make it as hilarious as the usual 'Seinfeld'.Good fun for a rainy weekend."
2,Not as good as the CD,The CD version is obviously taken from a different show because the jokes are slightly different and the DVD version has a terrible audience. The jokes are funny but this isnt the best version of the show.
4,Seinfeld at his standup best,"You've heard most of it before (which is, I suppose, why he's retiring the material). It's definately the best of Seinfeld in standup mode, though I don't think Seinfeld rates as one of the best standups (he shines in other formats though!).Many a chuckle, though you won't be laughing till it hurts."
5,"If you thought ""yada yada yada"" was funny......","1. How many comics today can make people laugh at the most mundane things in life?2. How often do you laugh until your belly hurts?Or on the flip side:3. How many times do you watch comedy routines and have to listen to ""f"" this and ""f"" that?4. How often do you turn the TV off or feel offended by the content of the comedy routine?If you want all of 1 & 2 and none of 3& 4, then this is the video to get! So often I'm turned off by comedians who focus on sex and language to get attention. Jerry Seinfeld needs only take real-life, everyday experiences and twist them into comedy genius as only he can. It didn't occur to me that grocery shopping, airline travel, and Halloween would be hilarious subjects. But Seinfeld makes it work. I've watched it many times already and plan to watch it many times more!"
3,Good enough if you listen to the audio.,"Seinfeld's jokes are all old, he's got no new material, but this is not what he promised anyway. He is burying old material.The thing is, you can just listen to the audio, for his skill lies in his intonations. Or perhaps we got used to his limited range of expressions in his tv series.But if you're not a serious fan whoi has seen most of his work, get the DVD, you won't regret it. He's funny enough.Nothing much inthe way of extras in the DVD except for a short Q&A; which shows him handling a crowd. Not too bad."
4,Interesting Twists To This Kidnapping Story,"Here is yet another example of a very good classic-era film which has never been given a DVD treatment. Too bad because a lot of movie fans are missing out on a good crime film.This kidnapping story has a unique, totally unexpected ending. It's also unusual in that almost all of the story takes place AFTER the ransom has been paid and the kidnap victim has been safely returned.It also has a twist of nice couple being inadvertently involved in the crime. The crooks in here are entertaining to watch, particularly the leader ""Tobey,"" played well by Caesar Romero. Some of Romero's sidekicks are stupid but just makes them interesting to watch. One guy, however, is a little bit too nasty. (This gang is not the most brilliant but their stupidity makes the film more fun.)"
2,cant send this movie back for a re-cook!,"Its a weak movie. Other reviewers liked it. But one reviewer who liked it does make a good statement, saying the movie ""dinner rush"" was a stronger movie. I agree: ""dinner rush"" was a stronger movie, so far as movies with restaurant themes go."
5,Great Product At A Great Price,"I have been using these for years, they help my heel pain a LOT. And now I can buy them here for HALF the price that the drug store's been charging me!"
1,hate it,My husband hates it..that too i got 4 of these..he feels constantly uncomfortable wearing these..waste of money.
3,Hit & Miss,"This book CAN be good, but the author has a bad habit of randomly going off on tangents about things irrelevant to Elliott's life, and spouting out random facts like a college essay that don't really have any benefit."
2,Big Nothing,"Brian Hayes (the reviewer below) got it right: this was a rush job done to cash in. Nugent writes like a tenth grader. His analyses of the music are obvious, he often misquotes lyrics, and he adds a great deal of unnecessary context that distracts from the main story (nugent often goes off on what could eventually be worthwhile tangents, but then leaves it up to the reader to make whatever conclusion he's trying to get at (at several points it seems like he adds details about the state of ""indie"" music just so he can mention his other favorite artists.)) Hayes has got it right: if you wanna know who Elliott Smith was (what he meant, what he means) turn to the music."
2,Elliott Deserves Far Better,"Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing is a sadly hollow, scattered read. Benjamin Nugent loads this biography with countless, rambling, incoherent anecdotes from Elliott's acquaintances. The best bits come from a frequently quoted Los Angeles Times interview with Elliott's final girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba, and Elliott's last interview with Under the Radar magazine. The other highlight comes from Nugent's interviews with David McConnell who recorded a good deal of Elliott's final material at McConnell's Malibu home studio, Satellite Park, the studio after which From a Basement on the Hill is named. For a far more inspired read of Elliott's life, check out the December 2004 Spin magazine feature article by Liam Gowing or the ten-page biography by S. R. Shutt on the sweetadeline website."
4,Recepient loved it!,"I bought this as a gift for someone who's a big Elliott Smith fan. He loved it! We couldn't find it in any bookstores. It's a great idea for someone who wants to know the background on the artist, etc."
1,Cheap effort at cashing in.,"Where there is a buck to be made, there will be an idiot trying to make it. That being said, I don't really have to review this.This person had no affiliation whatsoever with Elliott Smith and never even attended a show of his. Basically, this is long, unplanned drivel that is so textbook and basic (albeit poorly written and uncreative) that you'd be better off at Allmusic.com reading about Elliott's accomplishments, albums, and life.Right after his death, I saw this book in hardcover and knew it instantly to be a cheap ploy. I give this book one star for being fruitless, detached, and impersonal. I give the author of it five stars for finding ways to get our money. High five you jackass."
5,Amazing book when taken in context,"I don't understand why people are complaing on this book. For those of you who say he has no internal access to smiths life you are right. He doesn't have interview with his family. I don't believe we deserve it. In this life we have friends, we have family. These are the people that we share are inner thoughts and feelings with. They are for those people we choose to share them with and to pressure these people to spill there closest secrets with smith would be wrong. We should feel honored that that close nit circle allowed what we have to be revealed.If i could shake benjamin nugents hand right now and thank him for what he did i would. Some things are not meant for everyone, smiths life and secrets were one of them."
2,"I should have said ""Getting to know Benjamin Nugent""","I've realized I was wrong with my review I wrote previously on this guy's book, giving him a 5 of 5 stars. Not because I don't like the book, but because Nugent truly is a poor writer. I still enjoy the book because I do learn things from it and I do realize what Nugent tries to say in some parts (which is why I talked about hidden meanings), but that is what a good writer is supposed to do; they're supposed to show their reader exactly what they are trying to say, not hint to it. I still respect what Nugent tried to do, and I'm sure I'll read the book again, but it is poorly written. In my last review I gave him 5 stars because I was mainly reviewing him; I liked the effort he went through to complete the book. But I was only reviewing the person and not the actual book! Sorry to mess with everyone's heads!"
4,actually quite literary,"It took me a few months to get around to reading this. I've always been a fan (though not a fanatic)of Smith's, but I'll admit I have never been particularly curious about his personal life. But, I happened to hear Benjamin Nugent read an essay (on why young novelists don't write about work) from a collection of young writers and it was not only brilliant but impeccably written. And it avoided the cutesiness of so many young writers. Similarly, I found his bio of Smith to be a fairly straight-forward and, in places,literary (without the pretentiousness of so much music writing)treatment of the guy. It wasn't as impressive as his essay, but I'm guessing he had to rush this book out, which is a shame because this guy can really write."
1,Aptly Titled and Uninspired,"As an enormous fan of Smith's, I was thrilled to see this biography released. I think many of us were, after the loss of such a prolific artist, searching for some solace in the intimate details of his life. This book however, leaves you cold. It's more of a clinical documentation of Smith's work than an exploration of his life and mind. It gives neither comfort nor enlightenment, and is therefore worthless.Sadly."
1,such good writers!,"I can honestly say that the writing (the reviews) I regularly read on amazon.com are better than the writing within this ""biography"". It really is a disgusting book. The most valuable thing about the book was that I found out about some songs I'd previously not heard, and was able to look out for them (and find them later on basementdemos). His speculation about lyrical content (not to mention on what Elliot was thinking) is often ridiculous. And one truly gets the feeling that this man has absolutely no insight into the character or life of Elliot Smith (so he makes it up). I really could go on and on in this vein. I'm glad Elliot's friend and family refused to be interviewed: this man is NOT Elliot Smith's biographer. I give it one star because after reading it, I do know more about Smith, not much though."
2,"Writing style lacking, gives little insight to Elliott himself","Facts. That's about all you'll get from this book--it was very impersonal, and didn't really give any insight into who Elliott was at all. I was expecting interviews from friends and family, something that would give me a deeper glimpse into this enigma of a man. Not really what I got from this book sadly. There's another book out about him, mostly filled with pictures, that has stories from his friends scattered about it. That's a little better, I guess. Still wasn't quite what I was looking for though. If something could be written with a mixture between the two, I'd be the first to snag it off the bookshelves."
2,Winner Takes All ( Winner Got Taken),"This movie was a B-Rated movie to me. Many of the actors and actresses were no name and their speaking was not realistic. Especially Frank. His acting was just amatuer and really bad. Silas wasn't too bad but needed work. The pyrotechnics were bad also especially from their guns. The soundtrack was fantastic though. The movie could have been a major player if the acting was better. The storyline was a little unusual to follow if you didn't see it from the beginning. For future guidelines, they should follow the regular trend and keep to actors and actresses that can speak their lines with a bit more realism to it instead of sounding like they are reading from a book and trying to make it look real like a bad video scene from the Jerry Springer Show."
5,Sondheim!,This is a very good recording project and the result is worth having. Bruce Kimmel is the producer and there is an article about the album in the Winter 2012 Sondheim Review. We don't think of Sondheim and movies but this collection gives us a great perspective and the liner notes provide good info.
3,Walk the Line/Mary Wilson,"The artistic quality is not an issue, I'm very satisfied, on that I'll give it 4Stars, the product itself arrived with a broken case and consequentially scratches on the CD itself! I've replace the casing and it plays fine but in the future better packing is suggested!"
4,A gem in the lost and found,"It has been Mary Wilson's good fortune to become something of the queen of 60's musical nostalgia due to her unswerving devotion and promotion of the Supremes and their legacy. Sadly, this and a prior solo release suffered from a lack of promotion. A shame because both show a talent far beyond the soft coos of her back up singer days as a Supreme. ""One Night With You"" and ""I am Changing"" demonstrate a powerhouse voice that rivals not Diana Ross but Whitney Houston.A rockin' version of the Supremes classic "" You Keep Me Hangin On"" just blows away the original.Currently Ms. Wilson is reputed to be finshing a new CD, here's to hoping it garners the attention she is well overdue."
5,"Mary Wilson ""Very Very Hot Stuff""","Ever since purchasing the single ""U"" some years ago, i have been searching record shops for any further recordings by Mary Wilson, with no success. My luck changed when i found ""Walk The line"" on the internet,I immediately purchased the cd, and i have not been disappointed. The cd was well worth the money. I especially like the tracks ""Walk The line and One Night With You"". Please Mary can we have some more of your sexy voice.I wait eagerly for the next cd, you have what it takes to make it on your own. A great Admirer and Fan of yours."
5,Mary is the supreme Supreme,"If you are a Mary Wilson fan, this is a must have for your collection. There are three singles from this set, ""Oooh Child,"" a cover of the hit by the 5 Stairsteps; ""One Night with You,"" and the title track. If you recall, she performed the title track on the Arsenio Hall show. This set shows Mary's talents. Her vocal range is amazing in ""One Night with You."" Her voice is sensuous and sultry. Unlike most people, I don't expect every song on a cd to be hit material. This collection has several gems. It seems that more time and effort was placed into this project unlike the one solo album she recorded at Motown, released in 1979. Mary's strength has always been ballads, but she proves that she can handle up tempo songs as well."
3,study a bit before you use it,"I'd recommend a little study of geology, and the formations found in Utah before hitting the road with this book. KC Publications 48 page glossy color ""Colorado Plateau"", which I found at one of the National Parks, gives you a great introduction to a good fraction of Utah and shows the positions of the formations along with a time line. If you are a layman at geology, unless you prepare, you will get dizzy with references to formations aided only by black and white pictures. The lack of color illustrations is puzzling when color means so much in identification of rocks in the area. If you can easily recognize formations, this book is a great aid as you travel."
4,trip preparation,This book was bought as a present for an upcoming trip. Recipient was thrilled and commented positively about the author. It will be several months yet before I hear descriptions on drives in the Bryce and Zion areas. Book was received on time.
1,How Did They Do That? Motion Graphics (How Did They Do That?),"The book gives a very high level overview of what was done for a particular project, which is nice, but not really helpful. I thought it would be more detailed. Also, since it is an older book it is hard to find examples of the pieces they are talking about. I did find some on YouTube but not many."
2,Got the book in bad condition,"Got the book in bad condition, the cover was ripped, the pages were crumpled"
3,Lovely Story,"A story of adventure, courage, and the value of friendship. Overall I enjoyed the story, though it is not a fast, light read. The Miles and Little are lovely main characters."
5,starring chip n' dale,"this tape contains""donald applecore""""working for peanuts""""dragon around""feature running time 22min color not ratedchip and dale cartoons are awesome and the one's with donald duck are even better collect as many of these classic cartoonsas you can get your hands on"
4,"5 STAR sound, 4 STAR performances","First, I don't think there was ever a ""bad"" or lackluster James band. It wasn't in Harry's blood, as evidenced by numerous sideman who flatly stated at one time or another that he was the best musician they ever met, period. These recordings, originally done as Sheffield Lab Direct-to-Disc recordings (there were three, all of them absolutely superlative) show the band, as constituted in the mid-70's, blowing classic James charts, and some refreshing and unexpected current tunes (make no mistake, James had a superb ear for good music). The unexpected bonus here is just how darn good this particular edition of the James band sounds, and just how breathtaking these direct-to-disc recordings were at the time. What is really impressive is the dynamic range and sonic quality of Harry's horn throughout. With a quality sound system, he's unbelievable. Buy it just to hear a truly virtuoso trumpeter in the twilight of his time."
4,Utility extender,"The Larin Cargo Carrier is just what I needed for my small car, a lighweight platform to carry barrels and other items I don't want or can't fit in the car.The carrier came with both 2inch and 1-1/4inch load bars, which is much better than using an adapter. The only small catch was that instructions were not entirely clear about how the 2 halves fit together, but once attached the rest of the assembly went perfectly."
3,Not a standard size.,Be wary when buying this carrier if you plan to install any 'standard' Masterbuilt accessories - this does not have a standard sized platform. I purchased the Masterbuilt side rail kit for mine and it does not come close to fitting - the mounting holes are in the wrong places and the side supports are about two inches too long!
4,Excellent album but not for every one,"I am a fanatic fan of Caterina Valente. I believe she did much better interpretation in the stereo version of these songs, which have not been compiled yet. I wish the the label rerelease her Breeze and I with Werner Mueller."
2,"Good Dixieland, but poor audio quality","I just purchased this CD, and am very dissapointed with the audio quality. It sounds like a very old monophonic, recording, (it appears to be recorded around 1957 according to the linear notes) quite a lot a echo at times, sort of like when they used to try to make stereo recordings out of mono. There are much better sounding recordings from this era --how I wish they would re-release ""Pete Fountain Day"" from the the same year on the Coral label (I believe). Now THAT had great music and fidelity! From the audio samples available on this site, the $6 ""Pete's Beat"" sounds MUCH better both musically and aurally. When I buy a Pete Fountain album, I want to hear him at his best. On this album he sounds basically just like a sideman. I would prefer ANY of the old Dukes of Dixeland albums featuring him than this one."
4,Radio Free New Orleans,"You're not likely to hear these songs on a radio station anytime soon. That's a shame. This is joyful music. The trumpets they blare... The clarinets they wail... Dixieland at its best!Most of this is upbeat jazz, but then you hear a gem like ""Bayou Blues"" and you just sit back and smile. I like this CD..."
5,"Wonderful, but what else do you expect from Tiomkin?","The score is beautiful, but then, so is the film. Come to think of it, pleasant is more the word. That's more the word . . . pleasant. This is a soothing score that seems to match the spirit of the film. Tiomkin does a magnificent job of capturing the feel of the film, & was to be commended for his work on this film."
2,Boring,"Not a great movie, bad editing. This movie was drawn out about the life a billionare that couldn't keep his junk in his pants."
2,It's pretty one sided,"Movie tries to portray lawyer for children, David Lujan, as white knight but they're just lawyers.From Saipan Tribune:Hillblom's son sues former counsel LujanOne of the four DNA-proven children of the late business tycoon Larry Lee Hillblom of DHL fame is suing Guam lawyer David J. Lujan for allegedly inflating his contingency fee when Hillblom's fortune was still undergoing probate hearings.Junior Larry Hillbroom, through counsel Mark B. Hanson, sued Lujan and 10 other unnamed co-defendants, for legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, racketeering activity, civil conspiracy, and violations of California Business and Professions Code.According to Hillbroom's complaint, filed Wednesday in federal court, Lujan and conspirators were not happy with the contingency fee capped by the Hillblom probate court so they took steps to increase the attorney's contingency fee from 38 percent to 56 percent without informing him."
5,Love This 50:),"I think that this is a very good CD, everyone expect him to make another Get Rich or Die Tryin. That can't be done anymore, move on people stop comparing his work. 50 is one of the best Rap Artist alive right now. BFISD is hot, this CD proves that he still have what it takes to be number one. It is worth every dollar. Keep making your fans happy."
4,not a 50 fan but he does come better on this one,after hearing this i have to admit it is not a bad cd at all im just not a 50 fan. he has improved much over the past two albums which were straight booty! there are some nice cuts on here but i usually like strictly hardcore hip hop this is a lil too poppy for me but hey i will give him credit on this one. i really rate it about a 3 and a half but hey he gets the benefit of the doubt on this one.
2,Before I Self Destruct,Before I Self Destruct being 50 Cent's 2009 release and 4th studio album and in my opinion it sounds like one is listening to the same song over and over again. 50 Cent is not Eminem or Snoop Dogg. The only good song is Psycho featuring Eminem. The booklet contains no lyrics and some very strange photos of 50 Cent. On the whole this a very mediocre release. 2/5.
1,"Get back with Dre,,,,,,pleeeaaassseeeeezzz","Anybody who rates this disc more than one star needs to ""self destruct""! This flat out sucks! I wanna thank amazon for allowing this to be listened to or I would have been furious if I wasted my money on this ""crap"". Fiddy, go back to Dre on your knees and pay him whatever he wants to save your azz! As a DJ, ""in da club"" is played out but you keep making this bonk crap......U are gonna be played out! You made your money now go back to ""substance"". Take a hard look at your album cover becuz it's prophetic."
1,Love the cover,because I can picture 50 cent have his face melted off and dying. Someone kill this loser please!
5,"50 Cent, One of the best!!!!!","50 Cent delivered real big on this project being his 4th effort. BISD is one of the best albums this year. It has street bangers that will make you wanna do things yourself, including dance records like ""Could've Been You"" & ""Get It Hot"". The stand out records are ""So Disrespectful"", ""Crime Wave"", & ""Physco"". Also has a slow song that is crazy like ""Do You Think About Me""! Overall, this isn't like GRODT, but it's comes close. 50 went back to the streets with this one. Congratulations on a job well done!"
1,the worst 50 cent album ever,man g unit is falling apart his artists are slipping and good thing 50 has other venues coming because his music and rap crew sucks.
3,Step In The Right Direction,"After such a dissapointing Junior album, Curtis, Before I Self Destruct shows 50 cent in good form. Most fans say that the 3rd album lacked street content and Before I Self Destruct's first half definitely serves up that missing content but it's done over average or below average production.The second half of the album feels like 50 cent and Interscope had trouble finding a single to sell the album and so they packed as many half decent potential singles as possible on the disc, the only gem on this second half is Do You Think About Me which is one of 50's most personal tracks since Hate It or Love It.The JMJ documentary and BISD the movie make this hefty price tag well worth the purchase though."
5,50 Cent,"This is one dark, gritty, hardcore, gangsta', shock value rap album. I liked the movie included as well. Suprisingly good acting and script. Some of the toughest hardcore rap lyrics I've ever heard in 20 years. NOT FOR KIDS. I MEAN IT. This album turned up in your car ensures cops will be watching you from then on. You get the idea. That's why I like it. 'Nuff said."
2,About what it's worth-Re-review.,"HA, just wasted $10 on this cd and it would have been a steal if it was worth it. But not only does it blow lyrically, there isn't much base on this cd if you just wanted to drown out the vocals..50 cents should be the price it would be fitting. *** I need to add that although the cd wasn't that great, I just watched the movie and it wasn't too bad, so I threw this up from 1 star to 2 stars. If Curtis would have spent as much time on his lyrics and music and he did the movie included this would most likely have been a good listen. I wanted to be fair, so I have edited this review."
2,Mike Jones,Terrible album only 3 songs that's worth listening to and if you notice those are the ones that will make the radio. The rest is just album junk that sounds the same. He needs to stop beefing with other artist and find the motivation that made him a star! listen to samples before you buy trust me you will be glad you did!
5,THE RUCKUS WE BEEN WAITIN' ON 4 SURE YO!!!,"I HAVEN'T HEARD 50 GO HARD LIKE THIS SINCE HIS DEBUT! HE ON HIS OWN WITH THIS ONE! NO G UNIT APPEARANCES AND i DIG IT! OUTTA 16 TRACKS I DUG AT LEAST 14. FAVORITE TRACKS... "" DEATH TO MY ENEMIES"", ""PSYCHO"" AND MUCH MORE. DEFINITELY COP THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Better than curtis,I like 50 cent and this album better than curtis album dont like have a baby by me though
5,50 is back!,"ok so maybe his first week sales weren't so hot. but this album is fire. burns curtis (crap) to the ground! if he released this in 2001-2005 it would be a classic, 1 million first week easily."
1,No Way This Is Music,"I will pay him 50 more cents just to shut up. 50 cent lost his edge ever since his second album. I wish he would stop singing, make better songs and step up his word play."
2,Waste of Money,"This album is complete garbage. To compare this to Get rich or die Tryin' is a complete joke. In his first album you could hear and feel his hunger, the beats were hot, etc. There are two maybe three songs at most that have semi good beats. Baby by me is the best beat on the album and possibly the best song and how many people can relate to that?! And if you take away Ne-Yo's voice, that song loses major points. Half the songs you can barely understand what he's even saying. Is it possible to get a refund?"
3,WOW!!,I luv this CD....But my ONLY problem was that the bounus track SKIP!! WTF!!!!!!!!!!! That track is BANGIN!!!!!!!!! Thats not good!!!
3,Blankman,"50 just bring the real lyrics back to your music. Stop dumbing your music down for the fans who cant catch up. I know you can do better than you putting out, personally I think you might just be saving the best for last. The album is ok but 50 is much better than he is putting out on this album. Just check out the mix tapes he keeps putting out. Cmon 50! Gimme the lyrics that made you."
5,Pretty darn good,"At first I just bought this album because I really liked 50, but I had heard that this album was subpar. On first listening, I sort of agreed. But upon really listening to it a second time, I loved this album. It was amazing and remains in my car to this day. I listen whenever I drive. Amazing."
3,Average,"This is the story of a family having to get used to living with a stepmother and step siblings after their mother dies, and their father marries the evil Elizabeth. The book is told through the middle child's eyes, Emma. The father is not strong enough to stand up to the evil one, and her kids. The books goes all the way until the kids are grown ups. The book has lots of surprises, and secrets that come out. The author tricked me on who the mother of monica was, I had the wrong sister in mind the whole book. The book is interesting, but kind of drags on after a point."
3,For superfans only,"Don't get me wrong, I bought it and I'm happy to have it, but this is -NOT- music you'll drive around in the car and listen to (well, I do, but that's another story).This is just a set of incidental music from the film, and the primary value of these clips is association with the scenes from the movie that they were played under. Relive the memory of farmin' folk and Pennsylvania NG troops drinking coffee and gunning down undead to ""I'm A Man"", or the JC Penney assault to ""Mask of Death"", or ""The Gonk"" playing under the closing credits.At current prices you are paying $1/minute for very obscure electronica from the 70s. Don't buy this album looking for musical fulfillment, buy it looking for memories and associations."
2,Not the item pictured,"The hat sold is by Disguise, but it is NOT the model shown in the picture. It is a slightly smaller costume hat (read cheap) with DEVO in raised letters across the top and a slight brime on the lowest rung.Shame on Disguise and shame on Amazon for misleading the consumer."
1,overpriced cheap plastic hat,I wanted a devo hat for halloween. This was all I could find. Since I didn't want to make one myself I purchased this one. It is a thin bit of plastic that will work but certainly was not worth the price.
2,This youngster cannot be the child who turned into Holmes!,I was thoroughly dissappointed in this set. The plots were limp and dissapointing. This will be the first DVD that I will resell. I wish someone had steered me away from this one.
1,Worst EVER,"There is one quote from the movie that summarizes this entire production. It comes from chapter 9 and is a quote from Guy Henry, who plays S. Holmes (not too badly, if you leave out the sword play), ""The dullest of my entire life."" Imagine if you will all of those truly aweful high school drama performances you have ever seen. This is worse. A barrel of bad acting or overacting. Truly the worst DVD that I have ever seen. Avoid on penalty of being bored to death."
3,"It's okay to rent, but I would not purchase it.","I rented this set of DVDs. It was okay. I viewed it mainly to see Christopher Villiers who played young Jasper Moran. Since I am a Sherlock Holmes fan I had to at least rent this to satisfy my curiosity. Now I have.If you're a fan of Christopher Villiers then you might want to rent it just to get plenty of CV eye-candy. He is very easy on the eyes: a beautiful man in period costume of the Victorian age. I first saw Christopher Villiers in the 1982 made-for-TV movie ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" where he played Lord Anthony Dewhurst. He's a fine actor."
2,A good start but nothing more...,"Currently being a Computer Science major and enrolled in a GUI programming class teaching Tcl/Tk, I had to use the ""Tcl and the TK Toolkit"" as a textbook. I found it to be lacking in thoroughness and elaboration on most of the widgets. It is good for newbies and not bad as a reference."
5,"The best way to learn Tcl/Tk, and a great reference","Although more detailed books like Welch's 'Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk' are very useful, Ousterhout's original book is still the best way to learn the language. His style is clear and concise, and he covers the core of the language with good examples and thorough explanatory text.The layout is clean and easy to read, without any space wasted on fancy graphics or eye-candy. Instead, you get clear tables laying out what happens, or listing the commands in a certain functionality area. For example, page 122 has a table I've gone back to many times that lists the different return values from catch.Even though I have and use other Tcl books, when I just want to check a point of syntax or verify functionality, this is the one I go to. It's an invaluable book for a Tcl/Tk developer."
5,R&D Manager for an Internet Development Firm,"I purchased this book in 1994 and it is still one of the most used books in my office. I'm probably going to get a second copy. It has everything a TCL/Tk programmer needs to get started, learn about more advanced features, and create your own low-level commands for TCL. Most of the other good TCL/Tk books reference this one... and why not it's by the man who created TCL/Tk, John K. Ousterhout.-Richard J. Finn"
2,Contains very little information,"This book is very disappointing to use. One one hand, it is well written, and very clear to understand. But on the other hand, it contains *very* little information, almost everything I needed I had to find on the net, or search the man pages. It claims ""not to be a reference"". Then why buy it at all! I'd rather buy a book which teaches the material *and* contains all the information I need."
1,Never recieved the CD,"I would like to review the CD but ""GoHasings"" the company that I placed the order with is worthless. After 22 days of telling me the order had shipped they decided to refund my money and told me ""keep the CD if you ever do get it."""
3,Good But Typical,"Although this book is not one of Stine's best, it is still O.K. It only has a few suspects and the turn out is not as good as I thought it would be. It is a very typical Fear Street book. Not a must-read."
1,Not Worth It,"I usually don't write reviews but I must about this one because it was so bad. I was a fan for fear street for a long time, and maybe it just because I was getting older, but it seemed to me that the books just kept getting dumber and dumber as time went on. I stopped reading them after I read this book. It's not like any fear street books are actually realistic, but I think r.l. stine made too many people fake their deaths in this book. It had no real plot, it was like everything revolved around this one girl and everyone was out for her."
5,THE BEST BOOK YET,"This book reflects Stine at his best. He uses betrayal, anger and ultimately murder. this book was so exciting that I couldn't put it down till it was finished."
3,Pretty Good,I have not finished reading this book. :( I tried reading this book a million times. I keep restarting it. This book just doesnt keep me wanting to read it. :( I dont understand why but it doesnt. Try reading the preview (if u have a kindel fire) before you buy it. :)
5,Thriller,"This is the best R.L Stine book I have read since The Dead Iifeguard. The thrill comes at the end when you figure out the killer. Also, R.L Stine tries to trick you into thinking the wrong things. Undebatedly, this is R.L Stine`s 2nd best book. He best is The Dead Iifeguard."
2,Stitching on inner curve is hard on forehead / eyebrows,"Fabric is coarse and kind of cheap canvas. Also, Stitching on inner curveis hard on forehead / eyebrows. Have has several clients mention this.Price just doesn't reflect quality. Think burlap bag type canvas material."
5,"Quality, comfort, and amazing value","I'm a certified massage therapist. I've always been dissatisfied with throw-away paper headrest covers. They are uncomfortable and ""clinical."" These headrest covers are high quality and very comfortable. They are sized to easily fit a standard headrest. They are easy to wash. What more can I say? Just don't shrink them by overdrying."
2,Too much shrinkage.,"After using these for 6 months, I have to downgrade my review. They're okay, but I won't buy them again, and I can't really recommend them. The fabric is soft, thick flannel, but it has begun to ""pill"" in the wash. Also they're not as generously sized as some covers out there. They've shrunk to the point that they no longer fit my memory foam face rest. However, I imagine they'd fit fine if you used one of those smaller face rests."
1,Not suitable for the advertized use,"These items were advertized as fitted face rest covers for massage therapy. All massage linens must be properly sanitized between uses for health and safety reasons, the face rest cover in particular. The care instruction label says, ""Use only non-chlorine bleach when needed; Machine wash COLD; Line dry, do not tumble dry."" Therefore, these covers are not made of material suitable for the advertized use. A company that makes a product specifically for the massage trade should know this. They are not even usable as a one-time disposable, since they would need to be properly laundered before being used.In addition, the material is thin and of poor quality, even if they could be sanitized they would not wear very well. I am very disappointed that Amazon should sell such a shoddy product."
4,Good Quality,"These are a great fit, and are thick and comfortable. Only worry is that tag says not to tumble dry, supposed to line dry. I envision these hung all over the house when business is good! May risk one in the dryer to see what happens. 5 Stars if I can dry and not ruin them!"
1,Shrank too small on FIRST WASH,I am completely disappointed with these cradle covers!! I thought the price was good and now I know why. They shrank so much at first washing that they no longer fit. Buyer Beware.
1,WAY too small,They are WAY too small to fit on the pillow. My husband and I were pulling on them like Olympian athletes and finally gave up. What a waste :(
3,Face Cradle Covers,Face cradle covers were soft & washed well. Fit a standard sized face cradle but not oversized.
4,Good old fashion heavy metal(Still fit to rock and roll),Awesome collection of Saxons early material.This album contains material from the groups first three albums and previosly unreleased material.Great live versoins of Midnight rider and Frozen rainbow are on this album plus a great ballad that was never released before Ann marie.If you are a true Saxon fan this album will soon become one of your favorite in your collection.
1,Ninjas vs Zombies,"This seems like a bunch of guys got together with a handycam, a Mac, several cases of beer, and had at it. there is not so much plot or story as there is a bunch of stuff going on with zombies. This is silly and amateurish, and not particularly well made. but for pure goofiness and weirdness, its first rate. Ive seem more expensive movies that werent much better, i.e. Tokyo Zombie, Ichi the Killer. If you just like to collect movies, go ahead and get this, if your movie dollars are limited, there are far more better movies to spend your cash on."
2,Zombies vs Ninjas,"Laughable, but then aren't all zombie movies. It all starts with a group of friends and their perspective girlfriends. Everything is all fun and games till they bring the dead brother back that is when it all goes wrong. The newly made zombie brother starts to eat people for his own gain. He doesn't seem much like the run of the mill zombie. He talks, plots and carries out his need for blood in creative ways. It all goes downhill fast and the beer drinking, pizza eating friends have to anti up. Suddenly they all have super powers and they fight the zombies. It's a fun movie for those of us that like those mindless wonders. =}"
1,trashed after watching 10 mins,"Boring beyond words! Don't waste your money even if it cost 2 bucks, it's just that bad! This is something you see on youtube <----read got suckerd into clicking on the link thinking it was something cool to check out.I'm not going to even bother to check out the rest of the ninja verses dvd's."
5,Absolutely wonderful; the best,"I loved these novellas and think they are some of the best works I have read in years. The first time through I was riveted and struck by Good Will but did not like Ordinary Love as much. I reread them and saw the brillinace of Ordinary Love, too. These are so beautifully written and captivating with profound insights into human nature and what it's like to be a parent and how we can hurt each other and our children without meaning to and so much more. This is the best kind of reading there is with lovely use of language and compelling stories that move, surprise, and shake you, making you see life a little differently. I can't say I've read anything better."
5,Great Blues Legend Hop Wilson,"Steel Guitar Flash!If you want very Talented and Real Blues then I highly Suggest this CD. The are very few people in the same League as Hop Wilson. If you are interested in The Blues, then give Hop Wilson a Listen."
5,Nostalgia,Got this for my collection and it brought back memories. I even got to go over some of the things I missed on my earlier play throughs. Caught them all!
4,Step up to these larger speakers,Great full sound for an in-ceiling speaker and much better than the smaller size speakers in the same line especially with the lower frequencies.The directional tweeter is convenient to direct the sound towards the primary listening area and it does improve the sound compared to leaving it pointed straight down.Polk advertises something called infinite baffle which uses the empty space behind the speaker for improved bass response but it would be nice to have a baffle with these speakers to prevent the sound from bleeding into other rooms (especially when used on the first floor of a two story house).Installation is fairly easy as long as you don't have any obstructions in your ceiling. Make sure to be in the correct space before cutting the holes. There are brackets that pop out to hold the drywall from above when you start tightening the screws.Two switches under the grill are for setting the distance to the nearest wall and for a tweeter setting.
2,Not as advertised,"""The Go-Getter"" was not the movie its Trailer suggested. There was a consistent story and competent acting, but parts seemed contrived and unrealistic. After a while watching, both of us yawned and wondered how much longer the movie was. If you are killing time, maybe a good item, but the pace was slow, no real drama nor adventure. Could be titled ""Pacing Through Life After Stealing a Car"". Not a recommended buy."
3,mixed bag,"Despite the title, only a few bands have Armstrong playing with Oliver, and Bessie Smith appears with piano and bass only, not with either Armstrong or Oliver. Most tunes are either Oliver after Armstrong left, or Louis with the Hot Five. Some of the recordings, like the Hot Five ones, are widely known, while other bands are more obscure. Discography and personnel information are complete. This is a CD for the true lover of '20s jazz, and the rare takes are great for that -- but anyone wanting those will doubtless already have the Hot Five numbers, so they're duplicative. On balance, this is a valuable disk for a real '20s jazz fan."
1,Rykodisc should know better,"Rykodisc should know better than to let their good name be associated with this irresponsible release of poorly-packaged timeless classic jazz. Most dates given are incorrect for one thing. Bessie Smith, for another, is only represented on one track which features neither Louis Armstrong nor King Oliver (so much for the misleading sub-title on the front cover). Worst of all, many tracks here have been transfered at SLOW SPEEDS from whatever sources were used, resulting in longer track times and, more importantly, LOWER PITCHES than the originals. After all of this then, you'd think that they could give you a full CD's worth of material. Sorry - this thing clocks in at a measly 33:11. Those who appreciate classic early jazz recordings should find this same material elsewhere from more reputable sources, like Milestone / Fantasy, or buy this flawed disc for peanuts. Jim Bonevich - Kalamazoo, MI"
5,Bobke: A ride on the wild side of cycling,This product met all my expectations! It was a gift for my mom and she loved it. It was delivered in a timely manner and it was in great condition. No complaints
2,Poor Quality,"While this offers a wonderful opportunity to hear Buckminster Fuller speak, the recording as a whole is poor quality. I cannot think Bucky would have approved marketing it in the form it is in. The only value is in the voice of this great thinker who left his imprint on the world. Anna"
1,Rebate rejected because of qualifications.,"Placed my order 4 March 2012 for eight of these plugs and sent in the rebate exactly as shown on the form I downloaded and printed out.""Autolite rebate form: Rebate Offer: Receive $0.5 from Autolite with this mail-in rebate. Offer valid through November 30.""About seven weeks later, I received a card from 2012 Autolite stating that this plug does not qualify for the rebate.First time that I can recall that I ever had a rebate rejected and I'm 73 years old and have submitted plenty. Just be aware of my experience."
2,And then what?,"Actually, I was able to pick out my type before I did the test, which was long, and confirmed my original opinion. This test may be interesting for persons who are new to self awareness, but I'm not sure of what use it is to someone who knows themselves fairly well."
3,tell me something I don't already know,"If you are looking for insight, look elsewhere beyond the Enneagram. This construct is great at illuminating qualities of oneself and others that are obvious. But in terms of really digging for deeper understanding, they are lacking. This is fun stuff to have, much like the astrological horrorscopes, the I-Ching, and tarot cards. They are fun, but not necessarily enlightening. The Meyers-Briggs can also tell you a lot about yourself, but again, I challenge you to find something from these types of personality inventories that you don't already know.Not for people looking for insight, its a fun conversation piece."
4,Innovative projects using stuff in your backyard!,This book is along the line of Gifts from nature by Matthew Meade. All the projects are amazing! If you are looking for a great way to spruce up your home with things from your environment then this is the book for you. The curtains are GREAT!
3,Good little book,"I'm a fan of Andrea Syrtash's writing so I ordered this book. Turns out she wasn't the author but the editor with Hundreds of Heads Books and most of the advice is written by other people. She included a few good exercises and some intros but not much else. There are some good little tips from the people she interviewed. It's good, just not what I was expecting."
4,I was not familiar with this group.,I first saw them on a reunion concert on tv. They are getting back togeather for a world tour. i like their sound and style. They have a great horn section that is very tight.
2,Not effective,"I own several of these swaddlers, all made slightly differently. Unfortunately, this one just doesn't work. All three of my babies (6-month-old triplet girls) can weasel out of it quite easily. Instead of having a large velcro area at the waist to secure the bottom half, it has just a little tab. One minor kick and my girls are out the bottom. The material is so stretchy that they can easily get an arm or two out or, worse yet, pull the thing over their face.I recommend looking at swaddlers in person before buying. That way you can stretch the material to see if it will really be restrictive enough for your individual baby."
3,Rides up on my baby's neck,"The SwaddleMe is a great swaddler, if taut is what you want, you can't go wrong here. It fits more snug than a receiving blanket, (we use the Aden + Anais receiving blankets) and the fleece fabric provides great warmth for my newborn. My only complaint with the SwaddleMe is that the fabric rides up under my daughter's neck (she's 10 lbs, 21.5 inches now). She often wakes during the night to swirm out of the swaddle which causes the fabric to rub and touch her under her chin and on her cheeks, which starts her rooting for another feeding. This wakes her even more in the swaddle. Also, when going to feed her during the night, the simple handling of her in the SwaddleMe causes the fabric to slide up too (no matter how taut the swaddle). I tend to use this swaddler for napping since I know I won't be moving her and she won't try to swirm out of the swaddle, but for longer sleeping I am moving to the Miracle Blanket."
2,Fleece smells,They use a dye in the fleece that smells oily and no matter how many times I wash it I can't get it out. I am sticking with cotton for my swaddles.
5,Essential,I can't swaddle. Both of my children startled themselves to awake constantly when they weren't swaddled. These products saved my sanity and their sleep. The microfleece is good when a blanket would be necessary. It does seem to shrink with washings but that can help keeping the baby from freeing their arms and de-swaddling.
5,WONDERFUL LIFE SAVER!,"We've been going through a really rough patch with our daughter's sleeping habits. Lately she wants to sleep in our bed, and right up against us. She has been sleeping on her own, in her own crib for 6 months, and now, at 8 months, we've run into trouble. I bought a Large swaddler, and boom - she napped, and slept in her own crib again!! The softness and closeness of her being all bundled up - even her arms - makes her comfortable to be able to sleep on her own again. This is a major MUST have!! We love it!! I actually just signed on to buy another!"
3,The Material Is Too Warm!,"This product is very easy to use, wraps around the baby nicely, feels soft and looked very comfy at first. But, the material does not breathe well. It kept our infant so hot that she sweated bullets even when indoors with the a/c on. We had to stop using it. However, we did end up keeping it, thinking that it may prove useful during the winter months, when it's really cold outside.If your baby is hot-natured, then this fleece probably won't work for you."
3,I heard great things,"I bought it as a gift for my good friend. I heard great things about Summer Infant Organic Cotton blanket. I figured this would make a perfect baby shower gift. Sorry, can't help much with describing how well this works since it's not for me."
3,It's good,"I have bought for my sister, who was born yesterday and is of great-looking, but it does not work in the summer because it is not made ''of cotton so it is too warm in the winter"
1,It doesn't work very well.,"I bought this wrap for my 3 month old son. The wrap is not very breathy. I always find my son in sweat when I see him in the morning. Also, my son hates it. He cries and cries when I swaddle him with this wrap. This product just doesn't work for everyone I suppose."
1,My Son HATED It!,"My son is not generally a fussy baby. However, one night he was fussing, so I thought I would try this out. I received one as a gift and had heard all about how wonderful it was. After I got my son all tucked inside, he started to scream, and he didn't stop screaming until I took him out of it. I tried it a couple more time, with the same result each time. Like most baby products, I guess the success just depends on the baby."
3,So-so,I think I ordered this too late. My daughter was already 3 months old. It's kind of confusing what hooks into where. I ended up using a blanket instead.
2,A blanket is better,My daughter doesn't like this thing AT ALL. She prefers just be wrapped up in a blanket.
4,swaddleme blanket,i love it. my baby sleeps all night long. without it he only sleeps a few hours at a time. only thing i wish is they made a lighter one for summer.
4,Perfect for younger siblings to hold baby while keeping wrapped up.,"This is a great blanket, I bought it so my 7 year old could hold his new baby brother without fumbling with the blankets. Very soft."
5,Helps Baby Sleep!,"Our baby has slept in his Swaddleme every night since he was born. He loves it and wouldn't sleep without it! It also keeps him warm through the night without risking using a blanket. Now that he's two months old, he's decided he doesn't want his right arm wrapped in the swaddle. This doesn't alter the usefulness of the swaddle, though.We haven't had any problems with him breaking out of the swaddle.It was an excellent purchase and we have two flannel and four fleece. We use them daily. Excellent purchase."
4,Love it! But velcro not as tight after two months.,"I guess I have a strong baby. He used this swaddle since he was 4 months old and only for nap time. He is now 8 months and I have used 2 of them already because he manages to break if off. After 2 months, the two velcro are not as strong. Maybe because of the cloth started to wear out from velcro constantly tugging by my son. I wish they make 3 velcro taps (the final wrap part) so that I can use it a bit longer and maybe he cannot break it off. Now I am thinking about buying a new one but he is already 8 months and it is getting hotter these days in Florida."
3,poor quality control,I won't be buying again as quality control is poor. ! used blanket and the second does not match first. not nice gift like i was planning to give. Suitable for dog blankets.
2,not what i expected,"COMPARING IT TO SWADDLE HALO, THIS IS LOOSE AND NOT AS TIGHT AS THE OTHER THAT I HAVE. A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED BY THE PRODUCT"
5,A MUST!!!!!!!!,My daughter does not sleep the same with out hers. I wish they made an Extra Large version because she is on the verge of out growing hers! I also love that there are two different weights- cotton and fleece!
4,For Newborns,"I suggest this for newborns. We bought ours too late, our son was already 3 months old and didn't like being swaddled much anymore. I'm keeping ours for our next little one and am going to use shortly after birth."
2,Doesn't last long,"I bought 2 of these last year, one in microfleece and another in flannel. I encountered the same problem with both. My chief complaint is the velcro fastener for 2 reasons. Firstly, it's irritatingly loud. Whenever I unfastened it to change my baby's diaper (even when I do it very gingerly) it often startled him into wakefulness. Secondly, the velcro lost it's sticking power after about a month's use and this made swaddling impossible. For my next baby, I think I'm going to invest my money in the Miracle Blanket...it's a lot pricier but it may be worth it. We'll see."
3,large size shrinks!,"I have two of these wraps in small/med and when my son grew out, i wanted more because the are wonderful. i bought the size large and washed it once, in cold water and it shrunk to a size smaller than the small/med wraps! i bought many other cotton baby clothes the same day and washed them all together and the swaddleme wrap was the only one that shrank. i give it three stars because the wraps are amazing to help babies sleep, but i wasted my money with this product because i cannot use it."
1,Would be great - if it hadn't shrunk!,"We've used these swaddles for both of our sons. When our second was getting close to the 14 lb. point, I ordered this swaddle and an organic cotton version. I washed both before using according to the instructions included. The organic cotton version came out fine, but this version shrunk down to smaller than the small size we were already using! It's completely unuseable. I've had good luck with this product previously, but will order an organic cotton version instead."
5,I'm so glad they make this in a large size!!,"My baby outgrew the regular sized Swaddle Me at 2 months of age. I ordered this one and when it came in the mail I couldn't believe how huge it looked! We didn't actually use it until about 2.5-3 months since it was so big. We would fold the top down before we swaddled our son in this so it wasn't as long. At 3.5 months, our baby weighs 17 pounds so it's hard to find something to swaddle him with, and he still needs it. I hope he doesn't outgrow this one in the near future. I think he'll be one of those kids who has to be swaddled till he's 6 months old and this blanket should work."
5,Baby Cocoon!,I got one of these for a cousin's baby shower and she's been thrilled with it. I had heard swaddling was still done and figured I'd get her one of these after I asked around. She's had very good luck with it and is very pleased with the results. It helps her son get to sleep and stay asleep longer. Great for newborns!
3,"Good product, but probably won't use large size","I am only giving this three stars, since I don't think many people will use the large size, as most babies are done with being swaddled by the time they are big enough to fit into this. We loved the small size of the product, and our daughter slept wonderfully swaddled up until about three months (then, she was just *done* with being swaddled). I bought the larger size when she was smaller, because I wasn't sure when we would stop swaddling her, and I wanted to make sure we weren't without a swaddle if she kept growing. It is very easy to use, and allows the baby to move their legs around, but keeps their arms secure. The velcro does get warn out after a while, but if you clean it out with a toothbrush, it gets a bit better. If you have a really big baby, this is probably a good buy. I think the lower weight limit is about 14 pounds. Further, we live in a cold climate, and the fleece kept our daughter much warmer than the knit version of this swaddler."
5,AMAZING!!,"I found this in a lightning deal recently and thought what the heck, I will give it a shot! Been using it for a week now and it has done wonders!! Our baby now knows when we put this on, it is getting time for bed. We wrap her up in this and then give her nightime bottle and once she is finished she passes right out in this and has been sleeping between 7-8 hours everynight now! I definitely recommend this!!"
5,Ahhh... sleep!!,I swear by these swaddlers! I put my baby in it and she sleeps SOOOO well! It is also easy to calm her when we place her in her swaddler! Great item!
4,Works great if you don't have a Houdini!,"I love these super soft, snuggly wraps! My son is 3.5 months old and 16 pounds. It fits him fine now, but I don't think he'll fit in it for very long. My son sleeps so much better swaddled, however he started wiggling out of even our large Aden & Anais muslin swaddle blankets. I was so hopeful that I would be able to snug it enough to keeps his arms in. No such luck! I honestly think it is a combination of our wiggly, strong baby and the fabric being just stretchy enough. For the most part, it works out because his arms are still down when he falls asleep. 5-6 hours later though, at least one arm is out and he's awake! I just pray he'll grow out of swaddling soon!Pros:-Soft, warm-Easy to put onCons:-A little more growing room would be nice-Not secure enough for Houdini babiesMake sure shoulders are in the little shoulder pockets to keep it as snug as possible!"
5,Wonderful,"I used this for our baby once she outgrew the newborn one. I had two of them and rotated back and forth between them all winter. The baby was able to sleep warm and secure. Once she got old enough, she wiggled out of it, but then we stopped using it. The velcro did get stuck with hair, but I pulled it out and can't wait to use it for baby number two someday."
4,great product!,"Bought this for my older baby who still wants to be swaddled, but gets very hot. The cotton is a nice fabric, although it does shrink. My baby is 3 mos old and approx 15 lbs and theres still plenty of room for him to grow."
2,ended up around the baby's face..,"This product is easier to use than the miracle blanket, but unfortunately also easy for the baby to break out of. She was napping in it once and I found her with it up around her nose & mouth, which was a bit alarming. We stopped using it after that and stuck with the miracle blankets. That being said, this is probably fine for a very young baby who can't break out of it, or fine if you are watching the baby constantly (e.g. if they are napping in a swing in the living room)."
3,not cotton,this are 100% polyester which is well known material for being a non breathable material. It will make your baby sweat through the night/day. Please note this is a carachteristic of Polyester material. Buy teh 100% cotton one instead.
4,Swaddleme Adjustable Infant Wrap,"The Swaddleme is an awesome product if your baby enjoys being swaddled. Our baby slept best when swaddled, but could often work his arms out of the blankets that we swaddled him in. We found that he stayed swaddled longer, and thus slept longer, when he was in his Swaddleme. I gave my sister one when she had a baby, and she loved it so much, she ordered two more. I couldn't find a local store that sold a large (when he outgrew the small one), and thus ordered it from Amazon."
5,A great book not to be missed,RMS Lusitania: The ship & Her Record is a great book. Wonderful pictures and very informative. The author is a professional researcher on the Lusitania and it shows. I was priviledged years ago when I started my own research to have corresponded with him. A worthy book to add to your collection.Paul Latimer
5,A must have for the Cunarder !,"A well written book about a splended ship that's life was cut short due to the agonies of the Great War. Mr. Sauder's knowledge and personal photo collection of the Lusitania is without compare and, his actual dive experiences to wreck continues to add to his vast depth of knowledge. A must have book for any Cunard or ocean liner enthusiast."
5,"Beautiful book, beautiful projects","I had the pleasure of taking an applique workshop offered once a month for a year at my local quilt shop with Ms Pandolph. I enjoyed the workshop and Robyn and her designs. I bought this book after browsing a friends copy. I especially like having the patterns on the cd. I wasn't sure about it at first but after decorating one of my daughter's hats, a pair of overalls and one of my jumpers, by altering the size of the patterns, I was won over by the idea of having patterns on the computer.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys applique and Robyns lovely designs. And it is alot of fun playing with the designs in the different color schemes on the computer, so much easier than trying to figure them out in ""real life""!!"
4,Stitched with Love: A Mother's Quilting Legacy - R Pandolph,This is a delightful book with lots of different design ideas for other applications included. You will perfect your applique skills doing these quilt designs. The only bad thing is that you MUST have a CD rom and a printer to retrive the patterns as they are NOT printed in the book itself.
3,Not rated,Have not had a chance to work any patterns from this book. Robyn Pandolph's fabric is pretty.
1,Hey Flies! Over Here!,"I had high expectations for this Fly Stik. I have had opportunities for flies to land on it, but they totally ignore it. Too bad."
2,So-so product,"We originally had this product hanging in our garage, where we were getting some flies near our recycling bins. It did not catch any flies. They were not attracted to it. We then moved it outside near our garbage cans and it's caught a few flies, and some bees and wasps too. Mediocre results at best."
2,No sections in the plastic case,"In the photo, it looks like there are plastic containers within the case for each item (pins, spools, etc). When it arrived, each item was in a (non-resealable) cheap plastic bag. I need it for a conference, so will keep it, but wanted to let other buyers know."
5,Excellent product for the price!,For basic mending needs this product is worth the purchase. I found myself mending more items that I had ignored mainly because I lacked the needle and thread. My only complaint is the box is not compartmentalized so the items will not stay in place unless you leave the original packaging.
4,Not as described,"First off, this was a gift to my brother for Christmas as he is a huge Raiders fan. The description states that inside the box are two sets of Raiders pieces. Home and Away. That isn't true. Inside the box are Raiders and 49ers. It's not that big of a deal for me because my brother actually likes it this way better. Just any potential buyers should know exactly what they are getting and the description for this item is not accurate. The box itself doesn't even mention 49ers, wierd."
1,There's nothing to keep my attention into...,"...so I got irritated and bored while trying to listen to this. I had borrowed it from a friend, but I don't feel like taking it to in-depth listening.... what I heard was enough for now. Maybe the songs can grow on me if i hear someone playing them and people enjoying, but until then I suggest that you buy some other great compilation like one from the East 2 West - series on turkish based Doublemoon Records run by modern sufi-musician Mercan Dede.Bar de Lune has released wonderful albums from Christophe Goze and Radar, and I have a feeling Fragile State and Al-Pha-X albums could be good stuff also (haven't heard them yet). But this compilation has none of them on it, but a long list of projects previously unknown to me. And none of them sticks in my head...You might also want to try Arabian Travels compilations on ever-great Six Degrees Records and their new artist release called Niyaz, combining persian music with cutting-edge electronics."
4,A refreshing autobiography,"While most rock star autobiographies attempt to enhance the ""myth of celebrity"", Gary Numan offers a surprisingly candid and blunt assessment of his career. His story of rags-to-riches-to-rags again might not be unique, but it's rarely told with this much honesty and self-criticism. Anyone who still clings to the notion of Gary Numan as a ""living legend"" will be disappointed. But for those of us who appreciate the music and are willing to have our preconceptions dispelled, it's a fascinating read."
2,Wrong colors,"The fabric quality was what I expected, since I've ordered a tapestry from amazon before. Unfortunately, the colors are not what was represented in the picture. The pic appears to show a more turquoise tone, with a lot of contrast between the colors. What arrived was more of a slate blue, and almost monotone. I really love the tree image, and am disappointed that the overall product is just not what I expected."
1,Didn't fit.,"This bracket purchased with same brand mailbox. Apparently, however, it only works with certain plastic models, not metal boxes. Construction is also flimsy. Used a piece of wood instead and sent this back to vendor."
2,Disappointed,"Though it's Eric Burdon singing, these aren't the original recordings of his songs. They've been redone, not remastered, and you can tell. All of the band music simply isn't there. The Rising Sun isn't as good as the original, nor is Spill the Wine. I was looking for the ""Original"" recordings. I'll have to search for them elsewhere, probably on I-Tunes. Bummer."
2,Not what it claims to be,"All remakes of The Animals best songs sung only by Eric Burdon and some back--up band. Don't waste your money on this, get the Best of The Animals instead."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is very weak ""covers"" of Eric Burdon and or Animals tunes by Eric Burdon and some soulless studio group. Come on...synth horns on Monterey?? Eric what were you thinking. Seek out the original versions such as on the 5 star Animals retrospective. This album is a MAJOR disappointment."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I took one for the team when I bought this dud. With a song list as listed, I was more than happy to plunk down my money. Until I gave it a listen. NOT THE ORIGINAL SONGS! Just a cheap lounge-act remake of the originals. They put warning labels on albums for naughty lauguage. They should put a warning label on this one: ""Eric Burdon doing cover songs of himself!""."
1,"Delete ""Monterey"" And I'll Give It 4 Stars","Everytime ""Monterey"" comes on the radio my first instinct is to change the station. But, somehow it's like passing a train wreck and not being able to look away. It's so bad I have to listen. The lyrics make me cringe. Whoever wrote this song apparently had never heard of ""poetic meter"". Can someone explain to me why Eric Burdon whispers ""In the beginning......."" at the start of the song? It makes no sense. The instruments sound like some non-musicians came into the studio and began playing with them. I'm a fan of Eric Burdon (and The Animals) but this song should never have been written or recorded."
2,So many things are not right about this recording,"1. Absolutely lacks the fire of the originals; it sounds tired.2. At best, the packaging is misleading; at worst, it is fraudulent. Name another ""greatest hits"" recording that did not consist of the originals?3. The background vocals sound lame - see #1 above.The Animals did some great stuff, especially some of their covers of Howlin' Wolf and Little Richard. It's too bad that this tired re-hash is being pawned off as their best."
1,Absolute dissapointment.,"I bought this CD hoping for the real, original sound of the works of Eric Burdon, but I was wrong. All of the songs were re-recorded,poorly, with synthisizers and modern studio equipment. The songs ""Don't Bring Me Down""and ""When I Was Young"" didn't sound AT ALL like the original songs. If you want to listen to the works of Eric Burdon, be sure that the music is original."
2,Disappointing,"This CD contains 16 re-recordings of Eric Burdon's greatest songs. Sadly, the arrangement is quite weak, and the songs are from an album released earlier called ""The Animals' Greatest Hits"" or something like that. That CD is a bootleg released by Disky, and Eric doesn't receive any royalties from it.But still - Eric sings quite all right, so if the info above doesn't scare you off, perhaps you should give it a shot."
1,Absolutely the Best (rerecorded),"No doubt the material is his absolutely best, but not the original arrangement which is a BIG disappointment."
2,Look good- don't grip,I can't even grip chicken secure enough to turn over. The gripping area is not grooved or notchedor rough enough to hold on to anything. Didn't anyone one quality control this product to see if itcould perform this function?
3,too short for the grill,"Perhaps it was my fault but I thought the 10 inch tongs referred to the length NOT including the handle. We are looking for long tongs to use when grilling. My husband prefers the scissors type handle and the round ""grabbers"". These are what we want but just aren't long enough."
5,Cooking Tongs,They are study and are strong. The tongs have a great grip. The finger space is a little tight. The product was as expected.
4,Excellent buy!,This is one of the very few that actuall does what it is supposed to! It does block UV better than much more expensive filters.
2,what's that in my pic?,"a cheap piece of glass that provides minimum protection and big annoyance.It is okay when I take pictures in door with it, but what about outdoor experience? It disappoints me...I uploaded the picture took with this filter on, see that?That's what you get. Don't even pay $10 for it."
4,"good, but with a little flaring",Gives a green flare from highlights when used in the night or in long exposures. But otherwise a very good one.
4,An insurance policy for your lens,I take my camera to the beach for photographs. The filter acts as a barrier against mist being blown around in the humid atmosphere. I don't worry about wiping this filter down nearly as much as I do the lens.
3,OK...,"I bought this after reviewing a review site, probably the reason why most people buy it. It does cut the glare but in terms of general purpose use, i shoot a lot of outdoor event photography, and i get tons of flare from this filter. If you shoot a lot of outdoor where direct light sources may be an issue, get high quality multicoated filters. I will be returning this product as it does not fulfill my needs."
4,"Prevents damage to the lens, ""may"" filter haze","I purchased this for Nikon lenses to prevent damage to the primary lenses, and to facilitate easier cleaning. Glass surfaces are polished, flat, and thin to prevent edge distortion at wide angles. If ""haze filtering"" represents the ability of this product to prevent haze from touching the primary camera filter, it does that. I have not found any UV Haze filters that effectually filter haze out of photographs."
3,"Ok, but not recommended","The build quality seems to be ok for the price. But be very careful, it will be very difficult to remove the filter from your lens. I tried tens of times but failed. I do not want to take the risk of damaging my camera lens. So, this filter will stay forever. And, there is no way that I can ship it back for a return."
4,One of Jerry Goldsmith's best...,"Jerry Goldsmiths score for ""Air Force One"" is one of the best action sountracks I've ever heard. The score drives this film along with it's patriotic main theme, to the terrorists' threatening motif. But what is up with only 30 minutes of music on the CD!!!??? I really enjoyed the exciting music used to underscore the dogfight scene. Why isn't it on the soundtrack? And how about the end title sequence? This greatly sums up all of the films key music. I've said it once, and I'll say it again, put more music on the sound track releases."
4,Longer music would have been nice...,"I wish record companies allow more freedom to record music at greater length than 30 min, especially when a disc can be filled to 80 min. The flim Air Force One was an excellent movie and the music could have been much more than it was.still it was an good work."
5,Soundtrack of Air Force One,"I saw the movie several years ago, but didn't pay as much attention to the music as I should have. I recently heard a cut on PBS and knew I had to have the entire soundtrack. I was not disappointed. It has become one of my favorites to listen to in my vehicle. Jerry Goldsmith is a master of sound. If you like amazing sounds that come together well, you will want to purchase this soundtrack."
5,I love IT.,"This is some good music from the movie, but were did the other music go? This is a very easy listening CD. I recommend that if want to relax listen to this CD. God bless"
4,An excellent example of modern Goldsmith action music!,"Jerry Goldsmith had a couple of weeks to write the score to this following the rejection of Randy Newman's score. Goldsmith delivers the goods here with a great patriotic fanfare and some really great action music filled with ostinatos galor. 30 minutes may not seem like enough music, but the disc is perfect in the amount of music it provides. The themes are well developed and never over used. Joel Mc Neely provided additional cues due to time constraints on Goldsmith, but they (unfortunately) are not included. Buy this disc.~DTodd Smith"
3,*product not as pictured*,Received this product to replace reading bulbs in my RV and their glass envelope is a regular single contact bayonnet oval clear glass bayonnet type envelope. Not as pictured. As if it isn't tough enough to get bayonnet base bulbs!
1,I should never have read a self-help book...,"...so that was my first mistake! Gottfried's first mistake is to assume that the problems that his patients experienced reflected a fundamental problem with the religion itself. His second mistake is to take God out of the equation and take a secular approach to personal happiness. The truth is, you can EITHER believe in God, based on a combination of personal experience and historical proof (Lee Strobel and Josh MacDowell are highly recommended), or you can not believe in God, in which case you should just relax. But if you do believe in God it sort of makes sense to do what He (or She if you like) says, and if you don't then what is the guilt for?"
4,A good yarn,"A slow-paced good story with the occasional chuckle and bits of poignant sadness. What I liked most about this movie were how the different characters interact with Finn (Excellently played by Peter Dinklage). For example, parts where Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) and Emily (Michelle Williams) say things like ""you don't have to say anything, or we can eat quietly,"" help show their empathy with Finn's need for peace quiet. That same empathy helps them see him as a person, and ask him about his interests and where he's from. This contrasts with Joe's or the little girl's treatment of Finn. Overall, a very charming film with well-filmed scenery."
4,Short But Sweet,"If you're looking for a ""small"" movie, this should fill the bill. I'd heard a couple of critics praise ""The Station Agent"" and had hoped to see it on the big screen. Unfortunately, it only played at one theater, and I never made it. Finally got to watch it the other night, and I must say it was well worth the wait. Peter Dinklage works wonders with just his face. When he's on the screen you can't take your eyes off him. There's never a false note in his performance. And the same can be said of his co-stars, Patricia Clarkson and Bobby Cannavale (where did this guy come from?). I just wanted to hang out with these three characters... which is really all you can ask from a movie. I also watched ""Cold Mountain"" the same weekend, and I want to say that with respective running times of 88-minutes and 155-minutes, ""... Agent"" delivers much more entertainment value!"
5,I LOVED this movie,"...which probably means that 98% of the people watching the current Hollywood junk will not. I find myself telling people ""You have GOT to see this movie!"". I do, however, have a strange taste in movies...my 2 favorites being ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn"" and ""The Godfather""."
5,Sweet and Heartbreaking,"The Station Agent - the best movie I have seen in a long time. The characters are finely developed and the relationships that develop between them as their lives converge are deep and believable. The overall tone of the movie is gentle and profound. The Peter Dinklage character is wry and smart and handsome. Patricia Clarkson is heartrending as a bereaved mother, and the Bobby Cannavale character who has reluctantly taken over his father's hot dog truck is awesome as he cluelessly and doggedly harasses the other characters into friendship and out of their shells. The character Cleo (played by Raven Goodwin)is a scene-stealer."
5,Just finished Watching The Station Agent.,"Wonderful film. Wonderful cast. Wonderful story. I'll never forget it. The actors were superb. It was a human story about real people, almost like it wasn't scripted or cast. Was the writing so excellent...... was the acting so flawless? What is it that makes cast, characters, writing, music, camera, direction and editing come together to make a film so memorable as this one? I certainly don't know. But, the film did deliver and it did so, perfectly. Even more than before we can see that friends are our humanity."
4,low-key but worth savoring,"I did not know what to expect when I watched this film but found it to be a wonderful, low-key, understated film, well executed, brilliantly cast with excellent performances all around. A trio of eccentric people in a small town become reluctant friends and share ups and downs together, drawing each other out of their respective shells, depressions and introversions. Peter Dinklage plays Finnbar McBride, a dwarf who has a passion for trains and inherits an abandoned train depot, where he intends to live in solitude, that is until well meaning neighbors and townsfolk (Bobby Cannavale as Joe the hot dog vendor and Patricia Clarkson as local artist Olivia) insist on including Finn in their activities. What evolves is a deep and meaningful friendship among the three, and though there are difficulties and rough spots, they persevere. A very pleasant film, highly recommended."
3,Still dificult to be different,"Small film (I know, everybody did it!) about an introspective dwarf with more charisma than Marlon Brando trying not to get hurt in his contacts with ""regular"" people. The leader is intriguing, but after one hour one starts to wonder where this is going and why. With a performance like that, I would like to have a movie that brings us to some change, something bigger than life. But doesn't happen: little everything is in the mind of the director."
2,run away as fast as you can,This movie must be a chick flick. It is soooooo slow. I want my money back. Here is the plot . A dwarf meets two people and they hang out and talk. Talk slowly. I could have been cleaning toilets or something useful instead of wasting time on this movie
2,Item Not What I Wanted,I sent for this DVD because I thought the movie was charming and wanted to share it with others. I found to my disappointment that this DVD could only be played on a COMPUTER...not the usual DVD player most people have...therefore I was not able to share it with people without a computer...and I don't care to watch it on my computer either. It is a loss. There should have been some distinction noted to inform me about this.
2,Great movie ... tedious to watch,"Have you ever been stuck somewhere really boring and the only other people around are somber passive aggressive types with legitimate but depressing hang-ups, but you¡re so bored that you reach deep into your soul for enthusiasm to stir these recluses into having a good time¡ and for all your efforts, the wet matches finally give off a fizzle, but it¡s just a fizzle, not a fire? Well, I could really relate to the upbeat Cuban guy from Manhattan stuck in the sticks with two people who want to be hermits (a midget with a train obsession, and a woman depressed at the loss of her son). I just wish I had as much energy as he does. I would have dumped papa¡s snack truck and been on the next train back to the city. The acting and directing are excellent. Amazing character studies, incredible depth, realism. There are even some funny moments. It¡s a great movie, but the subject matter makes it pretty tedious to watch."
2,People Liked This Movie?,"I actually sat through the entire movie waiting for something to happen - it didn't. This is one of those movies that the artsy fartsy set really like, maybe because there is a vertically-challenged gentleman in it. Who knows. For those of you who like movies with real plots and things like that, look elsewhere. This is one of those movies that feels like it was done by your brother in some film school project and really isn't much of a movie. I love trains, so at least there were trains, but other than that, I can't get my two hours back from sitting through this."
2,More Jersey Quirky...,"Why is it that directors who set movies in the Garden State almost always depict it as a parallel universe? (OK, don't answer.) Still, boring is boring, even if it's quirky-boring. In The Station Agent, an urban dwarf with an attitude moves to East Bumblepuck, New Jersey and finds that there are worse things than being short. In the process of self-discovery, he meets a variety of quirky characters, including the world's dumbest mobile food cart owner, who has set up his hot-dog stand on a rural road with LITERALLY ZERO TRAFFIC; a pregnant teen-age librarian with a heart of gold and a Neanderthal boyfriend; and a very annoying sixth-grader. Lesson from the movie: Don't get really really drunk and then walk on a train track by yourself late at night. Like the movie itself, it's NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Could have been a great movie,The set-up is wonderful; initial interactions among the main characters are well done; but the last third of this underdeveloped movie is a waste of time. It's great that people are making off-beat movies like this one; but it doesn't follow that every off-beat movie is great. And this one isn't.
3,So-so,"This movie was a ""nice"" movie. It meanders up and down railroad tracks & back again. It's so sloooow yet I kept watching, hoping something interesting or monumental would happen. It didn't. I like the actors."
2,The Station Master,"This movie won a Sundance Festival movie award but left me waiting for the excellence it was purported to have. Reviews had it starting slow and picking up steam as these three actors became connected to each other. Never happened for me. Likewise, I looked for the humor and sensitivity and was disappointed. Overall, it was a bust."
3,enjoyable,"I liked it, but it wasn't as fabulous as I'd hoped it would be. Peter Dinklage is great in anything, though."
4,Thought provoking,"The Station Agent is a movie that unfolds slowly before you. The characters are complex, yet they fit nicely together like a puzzle. It's a joy to watch the main character (played by Peter Dinklage) evolve from a caterpillar to a butterfly. If you prefer loud shoot 'em up movies then this is not for you. This movie is about life and what it has handed you. Enjoy."
5,a lovely film,"What a lovely film this is! It is truly a breath of fresh air. I am as big a fan of the big blockbuster movies as most people, but this film is for the quiet moments. Beautiful photography, understated dialogue, and an intense focus on facial expressions make this film a very intimate experience. Friends oftentimes happen unexpectedly and come in all shapes and sizes. Friendship is all about tolerance, acceptance, and the joy of laughing together. That is the beauty of this film - the surprising joy of unexpected friendship. I am in still in awe two days after seeing it for the first time. A film rarely does this to me, so it has to be good!!!!In an age when most films have budgets the size of the national deficit (almost), it is nice to see a low-key film that is so powerful! This is one film that no one should ever regret viewing."
3,"Sweet story, but nothing happens","Minimalist in the extreme, I wondered what the ending meant here. No matter, I enjoyed the ride, gentle as it was. Three misfits come together around an all but abandoned train station in rural NJ. I wondered how the dwarf supports himself, while the Cuban hot dog and coffee man never makes any money either. These don't matter. It's a character study. No one gets shot. No car chases. Lovely."
4,Fun movie,"This is a human drama about a dwarf who inherits an abandoned train station in New Jersey when his friend dies. He moves there in the hopes that he can live in solitude and quiet, but instead he finds some unlikely friendships. This was a very funny movie that was also emotional and touching. I absolutely loved Bobby Cannavale who plays an annoying hot dog truck owner. Peter Dinklage, the little guy, has perfect comedic timing. I would definitely recommend seeing this movie."
3,Not Realistic nor Believable,"This film is too far fetched.I thought it was boring and seems longer than it is because it's so dull.A sad dwarf, a sad woman who's lost a child and her husband is remarrying and topping it off a gregarious hot dog vendor.It's an unlikely story that two adults would pursue the main charactor so deliberatly,almost stalking him.I'm surprised to see how many reviewers gave this dismal film 5 stars.It is not for everyone."
5,The Station Agent?,"I'm no movie critic.I have no professional basis for anycriticism for anything I watch but I know what I don't like,and I don't dislike this film.This coming from a guy who enjoys watching 'Northern Exposure','Twin Peaks' and 'Bagdad Cafe''The Station Agent' is in the same arena.It's about solitary a man named Finn who moves from the big city into a small town andthe characters he encounters and they're situations.Oh yeah andFinn is a dwarf.In fact that seems to be the whole point of the film.A could chunk of this movie is Finn walking around railroadtracks,Finn walking home and Finn writing things down.He's ooohso quiet around alot of loud aquintances.Well quietness for it'sown sake doesn't necessarily make for a brilliant movie but thepeople who made 'The Station Agent' certainly think it does.Solike any movie it's flawed and beautiful all at once.But I think you should see it first.It is worth it."
5,Perfect for easy-listening !,"Anyone who likes Linda Ronstadt, Michael Franks, and Astrud Gilberto should try this one. Most of the songs are very relaxing. The beat in some of the songs can be contagious, you can't help but sing with Clair. My 6 year old son always ask me to play it inside our car going to school or just to set me into a happy mood when he would like me to buy a toy for him after school!!!"
4,Let it Go,"I did like this album. Clair Marlo has a lovely voice and the songs were a bit different but I still wnjoyed them. I heard her voice at the end credits of the film ""Mother's Boys"" with Jamie Lee Curtis and liked her voice and this is the reason I wanted to hear more of her singing."
5,Great CD..Great recording!,"I used to play a lot with home stereo system (CD players and turntables). I had the chance to listen to Clair Marlo on an LP (Let It Go album by Cisco), oh boy was that great! Her voice was very soothing and all the background instruments were all well defined.I have ripped most of my CD collections into a portable USB hard drive for easier handling when traveling and this CD is one of those record labels that don't belong to a hard drive. It is best to listen to it uncompressed. I am very pleased with the recording as with all of my other Sheffield Lab CDs. To top it all, great music from a great artist."
3,Ending on a high note?,"This is the season-finale, the Borg are busy, the Romulan's are proably playing with their cloaking device and the Dominion haven't even been invented, so instead we get a political story that explores the issues of religion vs. science and Bajor finding a new leader. In hindsight this was an intricate story for DS9 but should've been placed earlier in the first series with the Jem'hadar being introduced as quickly as possibly. Three episodes were to follow that opened season two with an explosion! A good build-up episode but nothing else..."
1,Terrible way to end a season,"As soon as Louise Fletcher shows up (did she play Nurse Ratchitt?) with her whispering and her hamfisted calls to boycott classes that don't explicitly reference the prophets, this show is a groan-inducing hamfisted ""issues"" episode that Star Trek writers seem to love and everyone else kind of puts up with (usually with a shrug of ""well at least there's no talk of him being white and the left side of his face and black on the right side). You would think that the episode would ease up when the story focuses away from these silly debates that are so obviously RELIGION vs. SCIENCE (ones that only seem to interest Orson Scott Card anyhow) but then it dovetails into an idiotic plot that ensures that Fletcher will be around to whisper and act all self-righteous in future episodes, it becomes practically unforgivable.The only thing good I can say about this episode is that I didn't see it the first time around so I couldn't lose all faith in this show from the outset."
4,Some Hard To Find Gems,"Some of the tracks on this CD are from Ricky Nelson's first stereo LP ""Songs By Ricky"" (1959). Several of these songs aren't available on any other CD. I don't agree the sound quality is that bad. The mono tracks sound typical for what I've heard on other Ricky Nelson reissues. The stereo tracks sound really good. The following tracks are true stereo - - 17, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32. The back of the CD states ""transferred from original analogue master tapes"". The back of this CD also labels which tracks are stereo or mono, which is how it should be done on all oldies CD's.This CD is produced by ACE. The CD insert (pamphlet) is several pages long and includes several black & white/color photos of Ricky."
5,Pure Freakin' Heaven!,"Absolutely flawless collection of Rick's early, rockin' tracks. A Pure Rockabilly experience, with James Burton's searing Telecaster lines bursting out of Ricks' deadpan vocal at frequent blissful intervals.This is pretty much the only Rick Nelson CD you need if you're a Rockabilly fan. Genius!"
1,Rockin' With Ricky,The disk came in an awful condition. Impression such as if on it danced dance a twist. The impression is spoiled. Though the singer fine and the selection of songs was made by the real judges.
5,Vintage New Orleans,"I have the original series of 10 inch George Lewis albums and have been afraid that if they were lost or destroyed this incredible music might be lost. The new CD is a marvelous achievment in both preservation of important classics and significant improvement in quality. George Lewis was undoubtedly one of the best clarinetist of all time. Anyone, be they Dixieland fan or not, need only hear him one time to be thoroughly hooked. His art in providing the soulful background in Burgundy Street provides an experience both mesmerizing and memorable. I highly recommend this CD and am confident that it will encourage you to learn and hear more about Dixieland and George Lewis."
5,My 8 year old loved this,"I'm always trying to find story lines that will appeal to my son. He's not into fantasy fiction and has a very keen sense of humor. This book, and it's sequals, kept him giggling in the car, on the couch, in the tub, and way past bedtime. He would come find me to tell me what Spelling Beatrice had just said or what Exact Change Kid did. This book engaged him tremendously - he read it in two days. We'll read them all!"
2,Not Orthodox,"I began reading this book and realized that it was not what I had originally expected. Upon further investigation, I discovered that the only thing truly 'Christian' about the book is in its title. The book denies the true divinity of Jesus Christ and the person of the Holy Spirit. It denies the existence of evil, Satan, the necessity of the atonement of Christ and various other fundamental doctrines of Christianity. Readers of Orthodox understanding of the Bible beware - this is not a book you will want to read. While those that publish the book espouse the Bible as the basis of their teaching but they are leaving out large portions of it."
3,One to keep on the shelf...,"Not a bad book... but definitely not one of my favorites.As it is written by a journalist... it definitely reads like one. Tergat comments after each chapter's text. There are a lot of photos in the book too. The book probably could have been 2 pages long...Moral of the book: eat Ugali, listen to your body, rest, and run with all you got when you do run!"
3,Good price,"This is a decent product, can't complain at all for the price. The one thing I wish was different is that there is a hole for the center electrical connection where you can loop bare wire through and solder it, but not for the ground (I think its also called the sleeve). Again, I can't complain with the small price I paid, but someone might be expecting that hole and needing it to be able to solder the wire through it."
2,"Crude, unfunny",I don't believe that Chaplin achieved comedic excellence until his features. These shorts are crude physical humor and totally unfunny. Dated stuff.
3,A Very Dated Book,"I've had this classic for years and have read it from cover to cover several times over. When Dr. Mandelbrot mentioned Martingales it didn'thelp. When a friend needed help on the definition of delta correlation it didn't help. When one has to deal with chaotic or fractal noise it can'thelp either. It is very good at defining a Brownian or Gaussian noise as Einstein might have wanted it at least a century ago, but for modernnoise it doesn't even give a method of producinga random function of any kind. I would search for a more modern text ..."
5,Cheap Buy!!!,"Cable is a lot cheaper than what retail stores sell for. Works great, haven't had any problems. Make sure you download the necessary program to sync Windows Mobile phones with any Windows OS (called ActiveSync)."
2,it's ok i guess,the cord was advertised to include software but did not come with it i had to get it from the samsung website it is called ActiveSync all one word. other than that it works like it is supposed too.
4,"Complete, Comprehensive, but lengthy","Probably one of the few only books available that talks about CBA. Lacks in real life examples, otherwise a good read for grasping basic concepts and tools."
4,Straightforward,"The authors have put approached this topic in a step by step way. It explains important background topics as well. I bought this book for a class, so I really didn't have much choice in the matter. I expect that most buyers will do so for the same reason. To them, I say ""don't worry about it,"" this won't hurt as much as you think."" If you are considering this for pleasure reading, well, don't let me stop you."
4,Almost as good as the First,"Although this CD on the whole is excellent, I would have preferred a different version of the Joxer song (one of the reasons I bought it), as well as the song sung by the band in the vampire episode. It also lacks many of the African-influenced tunes which appeared on the first CD. Nevertheless, wonderful to listen to!"
5,Best mascara I've ever used,"This is by far the best mascara in terms of texture/consistency and color I've ever used. Much better than even YSL or Lancome, which tend to dry out quickly. I highly recommend."
2,Nice Headphones - While they last!,"I bought these headphones as a replacement to the standard Apple i-pod headphones. Pros: These headphones do a great job of isolating noise and provide a decent amount of clear sound. They are relatively comfortable if worn for two hours or less. Cons: I used these while working out, and the long cord became an extreme annoyance after a while. Also, the buds tend to slip out if they're not perfectly inserted in your ear. I tried the different sized earbuds, but in the end none fit perfectly. After long distance runs, all sizes eventually ended up falling out at some point during the run. The biggest frustration was that after about 3.5 months of owning the headphones, the left earphone ceased to function. This was truly annoying since it was just past the warranty period. I ended up having to purchase new headphones of a different brand and felt like I wasted my money."
3,OK,Simply OK; not wowed beyond belief. Actually tried allt he sizes available and still don't find a completely comfortable match for my left ear. The carrying case is clunky.
2,Great sound quality; Wires dissolve after extensive use,"Best sound quality I've come across. The design does a really good job at keeping outside noise out which makes for great sound quality. However the wires essentially ""dissolve"" after extensive use. Sweat and body oils breakdown and softens the outer rubber coating which eventually wears away."
3,okay for the price,"I have been using these earphones for about 2 weeks.Pro: it is alot better than the stock earphones that comes with the ipod.Cons: it didnt fit my ears quite right, i kept poping offthe lengh of the cord was either too long or too short which made it very tangled very fast.overall for the price it wasnt bad."
1,SHOCKING! Do not buy these earbuds.,"I bought a pair of Sony MDR-EX71SL/WK Fontopia Headphones last November to use with my iPod mini and they were a big improvement over the standard iPod earbuds. They block outside sound a lot better and provide decent sound quality, especially for the price.However, I cannot recommend these because I have experienced the same problem as some other raters, that these earbuds are literally shocking. The earbuds come with a 1-meter extension cord. I noticed that when I used the extension cord, when the metal end of the extension cord brushed against my arm, I got a shock. I had to cover the exposed metal with a piece of tape to stop this. Then I started getting shocks in each ear from the earbuds, at random intervals. This is unacceptable. I will be complaining to Sony, although I do not know if they will do anything about this.Don't buy these. I'm sure there are other earbuds of similar quality and price where you don't risk getting shocked every time you use them."
4,Decent sound upgrade for the price; not great for walking,"I wanted to write a review just to give a warning to those few of you out there who walk to work, or want to wear these walking around town. I agree generally with the positive reviews here. And, if you listen to your ipod on the train or bus, these will be perfect. The earbud design blocks out a decent amount of sound, so you don't have to crank it up just hear your music slightly.The one problem with earbud design is this: since they block out external noises, this has the effect of amplifying internal noises. So, every step I take, I hear my insides going ""boom"". Also, any breathing or coughing sounds louder.I'm happy with these, and hearing my footsteps isn't THAT annoying. However, since I walk to work, my next headphones will not be bud style."
2,Dead in 6 Months,"These were the first replacements I bought for the I-Pod earbuds. I liked the sound when there was a tight fit to my ears, but this was hard to achieve. When working out, they kept popping out of my ears. If the fit wasn't perfect and the I-pod EQ not set right, the highs were harsh and tinny.The short cord was wonderful for workouts wearing an armband; no 3 feet of cord to figure out what to do with. However, after about 5 months one of the earbuds fell out of the piece that holds it--it required electrical tape to put it back together. Then about a month later, one of the channels died completely. They went in the trash this morning. Caveat emptor!"
4,You could do worse,"I've been a Sony user for years, so after reading the reviews, I decided to give these a shot too. Compared to the ibuds that came with my Nano, these are a HUGE step up. Good base response and decent treble. I agree with other reviewers who have concerns with the quality of the wire leading to the buds. It's pretty flimsy and I can see it giving me some trouble in the future. I jog regularly and only occasionally does one fall out. I haven't quite gotten used to the cord having to go around the back of my neck, but I'm sure I will in time.I don't claim to be an expert in headphone sound or quality, but for the time being I am enjoying these headphones."
1,The idea was nice...,"I ordered these headphones because the ones that came with my mp3 player are a little too big for my ears, and tend to pop out. I liked the idea of a ""small"" sized ear plug. When I got these, I tried them out immediately & was NOT impressed. I must have exceptionally small ears, because even the small sized plug didn't fit quite right. And once I got them settled, the sound quality (something that I didn't think would be that noticeable) was crap compared to the buds that came with my player. Very disappointing... returned them the same day I got them."
1,Hate Them!,"The sound is not loud compared to other headphones. So you have to turn the volume way up to hear all the small details. Second, the cord is way too long, once you get it caught on something and the left earbud pops out it feels like your whole ear is going with it. After getting caught on a million door handles I threw a fit and ripped the cord to pieces. Now im looking for a new set of headphones that wont drive me insane!"
1,Return to sender,"I haven't even plugged these in and am already annoyed. The cord is designed more to show off the SONY logo instead of comfort or what you're use to with any other set. I am not going to sacrifice comfort just so I can act as their billboard. Instead of meeting in the middle, both L & R wires come together on one side, so you have this stupid metal clip/logo hanging right next to your face, hitting you as you move around. I tried them on and was instantly annoyed. Who the hell designed these stupid things? Keep looking, these suck."
2,Poor bass / low audio level,I tried to use these on a creative labs MP3 player but found max output too low to drive these buds. Make sure your player has lots of volume for these buds.
2,"Sound great, but not durable","When I first purchased these, I thought the cable felt strange. The coating was very soft and flexible. I love the behind the head design, and the sound is outstanding for an ear bud. By far the best I've owned. Unfortunately, after only 2 months the cable has nicks and has actually torn in 2 places! Luckily the wire underneath is fine. I had to put black tape on my white headphone cord, which doesn't necessarily bother me, except for the fact that the cable is now tearing at the edge of my tape. I am by no means hard on headphones, so this is really surprising. I have seen these in black also, so hopefully they use a more traditional cable coating because I would not recommend the white."
2,Great Sound::::Bad Quality Construction,"I've had these headphones for several months and after a month or two I noticed I would get a small shock in my left ear every once and awhile. It turns out it was b/c the wire covering was deterriorating and leaving the wire exposed. Although this model is nice and light, I think the wire protection was sacraficed because the cord that covers the wire quickly wears away.Instead of getting these I would recommend getting the very comparable ""Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones."" I got that model and they are pretty much the same thing, with the same great sound quality, still light (good to workout with), blocks out outside noise, works wonderfully with my ipod, also comes in a few colors, and the cord doesn't errode away."
1,Terrible Sound,I should have believed the previous reviews - the sound stinks - very tinny - no bass. Sony should be embarassed to put thier name on it - I'll think again before buying Sony. Also the cord is oddly assymetric and does not hang right. Terrible product - what were they thinking?
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I'm completely regret buying these headphones and not listening to the advice of the other reviews who warned against them. I dont know how anyone could give these things more than one star. The cord is shaped wierd with the length of the cord going to one ear a lot longer than the cord going to other. The cord is also way way too short, luckly it comes with an extension cord which is about 5 feet long. So if you i want to strap my ipod to my neck or my ankle i'm all set, otherwise I have to deal with 3 feet of extra cord in my pocket. Also when i go to the gym the buds keep falling out of my ear when i run, basically i cant use these headphones at the gym.Well, atleast when cord starts to deteriate in a few months (see other reviews) I'll know not to buy another pair."
1,No adjustment for headphone wire length,"I bought these for my husband. He didn't like the fact that the wire length was not adjustable. The wires ""hugged"" around your neck instead of hanging low. It doesn't say they aren't adjustable so he tried to move the piece that keeps the headphones snug around the front of your neck and he broke the head phones. So needless to say he never used them because of this ""feature."""
3,"Great Sound, bad design","Not a pro, but I've never heard in-ear phones that sound like these, truly excellent with great bass and overall sound.The drawback comes when you try to run or walk, and the little connector in the middle of the cord (which lets you use the cord as super-short (arm-mounted iPod) or long (iPod in pocket or on desk); the connector is far to heavy, pulls on your ears, bounces, and is quite distracting."
2,Not happy,"I purchased these in Jan and loved them. They sounded good and were very comfortable. However, the right earpiece quit working 2 days ago. I take very good care of my stuff and these were not abused in any way. Best Buy would not take them back (> 30 days). So, I had to call Sony and they will exchange them if they determine it was product failure. BUT, they will exchange them for a refurbished pair. So, I paid $50 for a pair of earbuds that were good for < 90 days. Not a good deal!"
2,if you want something reliable get something else,"I bought this set of headphone about 8 months ago, the comfort is excellent, they adjust very well to your ears and I love that they cancel out almost all noise. But the rubber material covering the wire disolves over time. First it becomes squishy and now it came off which makes the earphones unusable in public. Sorry but for 50$ I can expect a little more durability or not?Daniel"
5,Good headphones.,"Good sound, light and comfortable. It was a perfect complement to my iPod shuffle. I got it because I run a lot and with an armband the shorter wire length without the extension cord is the perfect length."
2,Below expectations,Not impressed. I purchased these as an alternative to the ear buds that come with the Shuffle. I won't be using them. The bass response is poor giving them a tinny quality. The standard ear buds are much better and the Griffin Ear Jams are so much better and much less expensive. This is the first Sony product I have been dissapointed with. Not recommended.
5,"Excellent sound quality, comfort and low price","These earphones are fantastic. I couldn't have asked for more. The sound quality is pure and clean. I don't need to play at high volumes and it completely blocks out background noise when inserted into the ears properly. I can't see spending $300 for other earphones that claim to have pure sound and noise reduction. Plus, these are comfortable to wear for extended periods. A great buy."
2,Remarkably Aggravating,"After using these for 2 weeks, I've decided to get Apple's in-ear headphones instead. It's not that these don't sound good--that's what prevented me from giving them the lowest rating. But their design...are you kidding me? Read Ian Kessler's review for a detailed explanation. In short, the cord length is beyond inconvenient and the ""closed type"" design will make you curse in front of strangers. I thought I could get used to these headphones, but after angrily throwing them on ground several times at the gym, I've given up hope. Good-bye, $35. You will be missed."
2,Good stuff but it broke,The sound quality is noticeably better than any lower cost earbud style headphones. I like the extension cord it comes with too. The only problem is that the right earbud stopped working 3 weeks after I recieved them. Pretty weak for a decent pair of headphones.
3,Ipod headphones,"This version of the Sony headphones are an improvement over the standard Ipod headphones. The sound is better (though can be tinny and w/out tons of bass) and the fit is somewhat better. However, the buds dont do well during exercise and therfore, I'm going to try the Nike Swift series. On the plus side, they weren't that expensive."
2,"Nice headphones, but defective extension cord","The headphones work nicely, but of course they're pretty much useless if the extension cord doesn't work. I bought these things yesterday, and when I plug them into the extension cord, the left ear stops making noise."
3,it has great sound but they break,i usually keep my headphones in the audio pocket in my bag. I kept these in there and pull them out and only one ear works and after that the cord breaks. But reguardless it has great sound
4,pretty good,i am pleased with these headphones. they do stay in the ear considerably better than my stock iPod earbuds. the qualm i have with them is that they take some fanageling to get them in the ear properly. but once they are in... they sound great. good bass response and clear treble. well worth the 30 some odd bucks i paid for them.
4,Nice headphones at a unique pricepoint,"These headphones are perfect for what I use them for: catching some tunes on my Zen Micro between classes. They block out more external noise than standard earbuds, but not enough to cause you to be unaware of your surroundings. The cord length is frustrating sometimes, but if I put my Zen Micro in a chest pocket, I don't need to use the extension cord."
3,"Great sound, questionable design","The sounds on these is amazing especially for the price. Unfortunately, a lot of the other reviewers comments are accurate. The cord is very long and gets tangled easily. They are designed with an extension very close to the neck, which I imagine is for using with players that strap to your upper arm, but just makes them more awkward.Ear buds fit very well."
2,"Sound is great, reliability is crap","The sound quality of these headphones is great. Bass is deeper than you would expect. The reliability is terrible. I went through three sets of these headphones in less than 6 months, each time the left earphone went out. I would recommend the Sennheiser CX300 instead."
4,Can't beat them for the price,"Ipod enthusiasts willl be happy with these highly stable, excellent-sounding in-ear headphones. The come in white to match your iPod, and the earbuds are comfortable. Let's face it- anything is better than the earbuds that ship with Apple's iPod."
4,Great for the price! Excellent for travel...,"I bought this and other sony headphones (noice cancelling). I travel sometimes because my work and I prefer use the Fontopia headphones because they are small and the sound quality is good. In addition, they isolate the outer noise enough good due to their design.The small case is nice and protect them from scratches...I recommend this product."
4,Sony Headphones,I purchased these headphones because most earbud headphones do not fit me properly. I was happy to find one of the sizes fit perfectly. The only downfall about these headphones is that the wire lengths are not equal coming from each ear. That takes awhile to get used to.
2,Great... for two months,"I disregarded many of the reviews for this item indicating that these earphones weren't durable, and went ahead and bought them. Now, I'm curious as to whether the people who wrote good reviews for this product think differently after about two months, which is how long I've had them for. Believe the negative reviews: the white covering the wires start showing signs of wear after about a month of use, and starts coming off completely after two. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,Good sound but I hate the cord,"These little earbud headphones have very good sound, but I HATE the cord...so much that I bought a cheaper pair of no-name headphones that I use instead.The cord is asymmetrical (imagine a wishbone where one wing is twice the length of the other) and way too short overall. It's so short that I can't put my iPod in my front pants pocket!It's awkward, it's annoying and it's a serious product flaw IMO."
3,Sound quality OK but flimsy design,The sound quality of these headphones is OK for the price and their design fits comfortably in the ear. However the cord is the Achilles heel here. The cords to the two ear buds are spliced to the plug chord and all three are held together with a very cheap piece of plastic housing. For another 2c a much more secure housing could have been put on. Mine pulled free when it cot caught on my seat belt. These are definitely not a robust design.
1,"DO NOT BUY THESE!!! Cheap Plastic, Exposed Wiring issues","Trust me. Trust me. Trust Me - Do buy these! I agree with all the reviews that say the sound is great and the buds are comfortable and it is cheaper than the higher rank ones. The issue I have with that is that they ARE cheaper, but, if you use them as often as I do, the cables get TANGLED up and are made of CHEAP PLASTIC and the WIRING GETS EXPOSED and eventually they become unusable. So, not I need to get new ones and pay more. Not so chepa after all. Only cheaply made.I NEVER write reviews unless I feel strongly and I do. I called SONY and complained and got nothing back from them. Splurge for the better ones, because you're going to pay anyway!"
2,Great for the first 2 months of using...,"but falls apart piece by piece afterward. It was serving me great for the first 2 months. But then one day, the left earbud just stopped working! No sounds coming out of it. Then the sound out of the right earbud diminished day by day. I cranked up the volume on my mp3player to max and I can barely hear anything out of it.Then, the rubber wrapping of the wire started to tear. Granted it's still ""functioning"" but I feel like it has 5% left on its life and it's going to die on my pretty soon."
2,Good sound but don't like the behind-the-neck cord,"Sounds fine. Priced a bit high in my opinion. I don't like Sony's behind-the-neck cord, but that's just my personal preference."
2,"Great Sound, Terrible Design","The sound from these headphones is a major upgrade compared to the stock iPod buds. However, the cord design is awful. Its been mentioned in detail in other reviews as well. Basically the left ear piece holds the weight of the cord and the extension cord (which you will almost always need). There is a constant, annoying, pulling on the left ear. Its so irritating that I'm giving up on trying to get used to them."
1,Extension cord is not working,"Just like a previous reviewer, I had the same problem. The extension cord does not work. It probably does not make proper contact with the jack coming from the headphones and, as a result, only the left headphone works. I was stupid enough to ask for a replacement which just arrived today and guess what - it has the same problem. Thank you very much, I'll ask for a refund this time and look for other headphones with a resonable cord."
1,Poorly Engineered,"I bought these when my original iPod headphones jammed in a gym locker and broke, thinking they would be an improvement. They miss being useful in the gym in many ways. The cord is very short. In addition the cords going to each individual earphone are unequal, they are not the same length where they join together. If you're going to attach it to your mp3 that attaches to your right arm it would probably be OK. However, if you attach it anywhere else it constantly gets pulled out of your ear. Because the entire wire is very short, Sony gives you an extension cord. This jack creates more weight that tends to pull the phones out of your left ear. If you jam them deep into your ear the sound is excellent. However, the moment they move a bit out, and they will, the bass diminishes considerably. I don't recommend them. In fact I feel that I threw out my money and will try to find the original iPod phones somewhere."
4,"Excellent Sound, for 4 months, after which they will fall apart.","I bought these through an Amazon merchant for 24.00. I am extremely pleased with the sound and the feel of these headphones. However, I can no longer recommend them, as all of the talk about the cord sleeves falling apart is exactly correct. After about 4 months, my sleeves started to sort of melt and shrivel away, leaving exposed wires on my headphones. In a vain attempt to correct this problem, I had the cords all re-heat wrapped at the local electronics store. Now, the cord is too heavy to wear when walking around and fall out every three steps taken. Darn.Although I like the sound and really like the feel of these headphones, I think that the production, not only of the length of the cord, but also the cord sleeve composition, make this headphone set a lemon."
5,Amazing headphones..,"I have been looking for perfect headphones for my NYC subway rides for a long time. I was looking for great quality and some noise cancelation as well. And after trying so many, I have to say that these headphones are the best. They fit right inside your ear, with the soft rubbery pad blocking a lot of external noise (getting rid of car and subway noise). Very light and comfortable. Have an amazing bass, and quality is wayyyy better than most headphones I've tried. They would beat the Ipod headphones by a long margin in quality, bass and blocking external noise.Have a nice silver carrying case, but both the headphones and external cord would not fit in it together.Overall, Sony has done a great job and amazon have brought its price down to very affordable (most placed like Best Buy, sell these for over 50 bucks). I would highly recommend these to you all."
1,don't buy,"Do not buy these headphones unless you are willing to replace them every 4-5 months. I should admit the sound quality is really good. But, the product is not durable at all. The cord that goes around the neck wears out too quickly. I bought mine from amazon few months ago, and now there is almost nothing left of the protecting skin around the wires. The cord gets tangled up very easily, and I think that is the cause of the problem. I contacted Sony requesting a replacement. They asked $29 to send me a refurbished one."
1,Broke withing two weeks,"Avoid these headphones. My pair broke within two weeks of getting them (stopped playing music in the right ear). The cord is terribly designed, either too short without the extension or too long with the extension. While the sound is good, that doesn't matter too much when they stop working. I dropped some extra money on the Etymotic Er-6i's and think that are well worth it."
3,cord is too short,"I love the fontopia headphones. I like the fact that the two cord portions that go to the earbuds are of different lengths, so that you can hang them around the back of your neck comfortably. I thought the extension cord this model offers would be a nice novelty for certain circumstances. However, the primary cord is so short -- just 16 inches -- that using the extension cord is almot a requirement. I'd suggest the EX5 model instead."
4,Still a loyal fan of the Fontopia line,"The standard headphones hurt my ears after a long time but with these babies I can listen to music for hours. Real comfortable, good sound and great bass for the size and price of the headphones."
4,good in ear headphones,"bought these for my ZEN, they work well.the wires did get caught in something and when the bud pulled from ear it caused a slight tear in rubber...but otherwise quality is high and sounds better than the ones that came with the zen, fit better in ears also."
4,Great Headphones,They are great headphones. Much softer than the ones comes with the Ipod. Sounds quality is better and comfortable.
3,Good and bad,"Positives: great sound, comfortable, assortment of sizes (my ears are different sizes)Negatives: ear pieces fall off the earphone so you might lose them, cords deteriorate after a few months use (just a hissing sound out of the left side unless I push the wire to the side), different lengths of wireThey are great if you don't mind replacing them twice a year. Would be five stars based on the sound, but a reluctant three stars because of the negatives."
4,"Great, For The Price","The biggest thing for me when shopping for these was simply to get comfortable earphones. The hard plastic crap they sent with my Creative Zen would hurt my ears immediately. I wasn't expecting huge sound for the price of these Sony earbuds, but they are fine for most listening moments. Not a lot of bass response, even with the BASS Boost on my player activated, but they work great!One gripe I have is that the little case that comes with them is too small and is hard to open. You have to work very hard to wind up both sections of the cable (you get a cool extension cable) and make them fit into the little shell case.As I said before - these are great for the low price."
4,Pretty good,"No complaints. For the price I paid, I think I got a pretty good deal. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because the bass isn't as great as I had expected, even though I've been wearing them properly.I especially like the long extension cord as I like to lean back while listening to online lectures. I also like the nifty white case just for the earbuds that I put on right before I throw the entire thing in my backpack. I stopped using the bigger case they give you to encase the whole thing as it takes to long to wind everything up. A couple of months have passed now yet I've had no problems with any wear and tear so far even though I've put it under these rugged scholastic conditions.If I had to, I'd buy it again."
4,good headphones,"these are really good headphones... i have been using these for the last 6-7 months. the soubd quality has been good,, i did not face any problem with these. it has good amount of noise control as well. definetly advice to buy this."
3,OK but didnt meet my expectations,"I thought the ear buds would stay in much more securely then they did - it takes some getting used to and I find only the small size is even remotely close to the size of a normal ear hole, because the other 2 sizes are huge! Also, one of the buds fell off one of the ear pieces so I am trying to figure out a way to get a new set of small ones.The sound quality is very good, though I was expecting more accentuated base. In the beginning, I actually missed my iPod earphones, as those fit more comfortably with less fuss.The detachable extenstion cord is a nice extra, though i find it is almost too long and hence hard to figure out how to manage such a long cord, but without attaching it, the regular cord is too short."
3,"Good sound, cables cheap","I like the sound of these headphones, however the cable system is annoying. One cable runs almost all the way to the left earbud, then it splits and runs back down your chin then loops around to the other earbud. It's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but I find it somewhat annoying and not an improvement over the traditional equal split found on essentially all other models."
2,It's mediocre,Sounds the same as my earbuds that came with my mp3 creative player. It's a waste of money.
1,Not worth the money,"These head phones sound great, the trebles are great, and the bass from them is unbelievable. Unfortunately these are great sounding head phones that are not worth the money. I have now had 3 sets that have all had the same issue. Either the left or the right side will lose sound. This has happened 3 times in a row, Sony warrantied the 2nd set after 2 months, and is now refusing to warranty the current set.Not worth the trouble you will have."
1,Lack of extension,"This earphones lack a descent extension cord. ITs very small cable, but its of good quality. Sadly, cord its too short, and the extension is useless."
5,"AMAZING PRODUCT, PRICE AND SERVICE",I bought this product from amazon as it was very cheap here. I saved about 16$ for purchasing the same product from amazon. The delivery was good and in time. i was expecting the product to reach me in about 8-10 business days... but arrived in 5-6 days time. it was a good experience again with amazon.
3,"Love the quality of sound, hate this stupid cord","To me, the sound is very good. I hear nuances in music I had not heard before and I even hear lyrics more cleanly. I absolutely HATE this stupid cord. The short cord is too short except for a shirt pocket or an arm strap and the extention is too long and is always getting snagged. The little ""fob"" attachment that supposedly allows you to wind up excess cord is just another weight to snag and add to the weight which is always pulling at the headphones. If they were so smart, they'd add a little clip to the cord so you could clip it to your shirt and take the weight off your earpods. If you sit still, they're great, but if you like to move around with your Ipod, these are a Pain in the A**. I wouldn't pay over 32.00 U.S. dollars for these just because of the cord issue."
1,Make sure you buy black electrician's tape also!,"Pluses: great sound, good noise isolationMAJOR flaw: these lasted just short of the five month mark before the white cord disintegrated. The white coating over the wire starts swelling and becomes ""gummy,"" then cracks in the coating start showing, then, VOILA! you have bare copper wire, not the nice white coating. Believe the reviews, look at the pictures, the negative reviews are accurate. (I also regularly cleaned the coating.)I also bought a black (silver) pair, and haven't seen the same flaw, but they're several months newer. I'll report the results of that pair after I see how they shape up."
2,Mixed Review,"Wow. It's amazing reading through these reviews and seeing how many people have experienced the same thing I have. I bought my first pair and really loved the sound and how it fit in my ears. It blocked out a lot of the outside noise so I didn't have to put my music on too loud. I used them to work out, walk around, listen at my desk, and sometimes fall asleep with them on. After 6 months of use the right earphone died on me. I bought another one because I liked them so much. After 5 months, I noticed that the insulation on the wire connecting the 2 earphones was cracking. It didn't take long before all the insulation came off. After being burned twice I don't think I'll get these again."
2,Poor Product Quality,"I like in-ear style headphones. It is the only type I use. I have purchased two of these Sony headphones and they sound pretty good. The bass is not as strong as a Koss pair I owned, but they sound good enough that I bought two pairs.HOWEVER, the problem with these headphones, as so many others noted, is that the cord covering the wires literally disintigrates after a period of time, exposing the bare wires! The cord becomes sticky and then gummy and then split and expose the wire. No more Sony's for me."
2,Great sound -- but not for long,"These headphones offer great sound and isolation. Especially great is the bass quality for in-ear headphones. However, there is definitely a catch: they break VERY easily. I've gone through two pairs in about a year. Both times the left speaker stopped playing entirely, which is simply unacceptable at ANY pricepoint."
2,There is an issue with the wires,"I used this for about 6months before the coating on the wires just went bad, for want of a better word. The just peeled away exposing the metal inside. the wires are much softer than the wires on the headphone of an ipod. Makes it rather comfortable to begin with but in the long term there is an issue with durability. The ear piece unit is neat fits snuggly. The box gave away too in 6 months. I dont think I will buy this again. The adaptor for extension can be used with other headphones which is a plus."
4,"Hey, it's those people we see from time to time,","This is a pretty good biography (I use that word loosely) ...style book.It's done in a witty, wisecracking way, but, after reading it like that for the first 10 actors, you start wanting maybe a date of birth, where are they from, maybe interesting trivia about their life.What we mostly get is the persons name, what type of characters they usually play, and a few movie titlesor tv shows they were in.The best thing about this book is a face goes with a name,and yes, some of the humor is good, it could have been better with much more information.I was going to give it 3 stars, but, because of all the faces that finaly get names to go with them, and some of the TV and movie info that goes with those faces,I give it 4 stars.It's still worth buying for those character actor fans in book land, of course you'll have to look else where for more information on these character actors."
2,"Read Once, Throw Away","Very disappointing. The authors fill most of the space with ""funny"" comments and other observations, possibly to make up for what little they wrote about the actors. I have a similar 1969 book (""The Versatiles""), and every year or so, I pull it out and read it again for fun. Most of those actors have since passed away. I was hoping this book would be a modern version, but it's not."
4,Enjoyable,"The book while an easy read and fun to read, it was to short on material, I am sure their is another teir of character actors that could be included."
3,Guide for supporting actors,A quicky guide to supporting actors you mayrecognize but don't have a clue what theirnames are. It was amusing and interesting.
3,Hey! where is that particular guy?,"Disappointed,no Strother Martin,William Smith,Clifton James,etc:So,I kinda like it not complete to suite me,i was really hoping those 3 guys would be there."
4,Love It,"I love Fametracker.com so it was a must when I saw they were putting out a book. Now I find myself reaching for it every time I see a H!ITG in a movie or on TV just to see if they're in it. So go buy it, who can't use a good laugh."
2,Feh,"All the attitude and nitpicking of Fametracker without the fun of the forums. Good for a chuckle or two but otherwise, don't bother. Listening to an advanced film study class provides the same ""wannabe but never will"" griping but without the risk of paper cuts."
2,Minor De Haviland,"This film has olivia de haviland in a supporting part prior to her later stardom. Ian Hunter and Frieda Inescourt are the actual focus of the story. De Haviland is an overwrought young woman in love, or infatuation with an older man.The part was played by Joan Fontaine in the Los Angeles theater. The part is not unlikee Fontaines Peggy in "". Fontaine was better than e The Women"" Fontaine was better than De Haviland in this gushing type of role. Skip this film."
3,"A help to the instructor, this book is incomplete","This book contains 33 exercises for the instructor to use in teaching gender and diversity issues. Several include instructions to the student that ""the instructor will provide..."", but this information is not included. A thoroughly useful compendium of exercises includes all the relevant material required to run a class discussion, exercise or simulation. This book stimulates thinking, but is incomplete."
2,Activities and Exercises,Is Mr. Powell going to provide an update to all of us who did not know his book didn't include the 'instructor' exercise answers? I wish Book Review 1 had been shown when I ordered the book. I would have looked elsewhere for what I needed.
4,I like it!,"Watching the movie: ""The Big White"" (excellent BTW) the James song ""Getting Away with It"" played near the end of the movie. It caught my ear and interest immediately. I'm not one to risk buying a CD or DVD of a group I had never of before, but I took a chance with this one. Very glad I did! The quality of the filming/concert location and sound of the DVD is excellent, as are the songs. I've watched the entire DVD/concert about five times now, and I'm not a bit bored with it. But do rent ""The Big White"" with Robin Williams and Woody Harrelson."
5,...takes you away,"This concert dvd is absolutely wonderful, letting the james fan experience the essence that has made james such a unique and quality band for all these years. Definetely a must-have!"
3,Bad Editing Good Music,The sound is perfect. The songs are perfect. The editing of this DVD stinks. The video cuts every 1-2 seconds making it hard to really see the musicians actually play their instruments for anything more than a moment. I heard that Tim Booth is known to really get carried away dancing on stage. You do not see this happen as the video constantly cuts from one angle to another. It is very disappointing because the music performance is perfect. If I watch it too closely it can be irritating so I usually just leave it on for the music.
5,this is the same,"as the other DVD concert but for about half the price. Im not sure why it is but heck..it was worth a shot just to see. The concert is amazing for any James fan. I do wish they did a few more of the older songs but it is still great. The audio quality is insanely good and you dont even feel as if it were recorded in a concert arena with ambient noises and such. It's amazing to see how much the crows gets into it with the band. It's also quite interesting to see the interaction of the band members and Tim's ""extravegant"" show..hehe. I dig this DVD show for any James fan."
1,Wont Play,I am so bummed mine won't play in Region 1 either... I have to send it back. I don't understand why they didn't say it won't play in the United States
3,Durability lost in newer version,"I have twenty of these in grey or black, medium, bought over a period of several years.The newer versions have more stretch in the fabric. Nice fit, but unfortunately far less durable.The waistband in the newer version stretches and bunches up out of shape in the laundry within a couple of months.Earlier versions bought several years ago and in constant use, in the same size, are still in near perfect condition.Both versions look the same initially, but they are not the same product. Too bad.I bought all at Macy's Men's Store retail, so this is not an Amazon.com problem."
3,its nothing special really,this boxer brief is decent. its not horrible but its not good either. it tends to loose its shape after a hour you are in it.
5,Calvin Klein,These are my husband's favorite brand/type of underwear. Wash and wear are great; very high quality of cotton. Comfortable fit and would highly recommend.
3,FROM HIS SECOND DRAWER,"Chekhov's ""The Shooting Party"" (1884/5), his only long novel, is a work of his immaturity, following the early stories for pulp magazines that launched his writing career but were later derided by him as juvenile, and four years before his novella ""The Steppe,"" rightly considered his entry into serious literature. It is a colorful, zippy detective story, yet surprisingly crude and squalid, more Dostoyevsky than Turgenev. The murderer's identity was easy to guess early on, and no plot twist surprised. Read it, just for pleasure, after you have taken the full measure of mature Chekhov in all his acuity and delicacy. The Penguin translation worked well, except for those relentless Britishisms we get so often from English translators. Russians do not call each other ""chap"" and their peasants don't speak Cockney with dropped h's."
2,Good news - No elastic in the leg,Earlier I reported that these had a very thin ban of elastic in the leg but I finally had to cut one open to really see and it turns out it's not elastic but gathered material that is stretchy. I presume (and hope) it's cotton since the product says 100% cotton. So if you don't want leg elastic go for it!
2,Too much shrinkage,"Nice but they shrink a LOT. It;s definitely possible to buy cottan panties that don't shrink. I'm going back to National Mosiery where the panties are better, cheaper, and DON'T shrink."
3,picture is deceptive,"This set of underwear was pretty nice and fairly comfortable, but I was disappointed by what came in the mail after viewing the picture for this item. It appeared there would be three pairs, two of one kind and a third with the fabric going futher down the leg, like bike shorts. Instead, all three were of the shorter kind, which were okay, but I had actually ordered it to get the longer one. Overall, they fit okay, and were for the most part comfortable to wear."
1,wrong item,I thought I ordered Vanity Fair rayon panties...these are cotton and I do not like cotton underwear. Wasn't worth returning to the store.
3,lollipop briefs,"There were no tags on the pants stating they were Vanity Fair Lollipop brand. that was disturbing to me....they might be another brand. The briefs are OK , but I wish I had the exact product I thought I was ordering."
1,waste of money,"Dont but it. It is a waste of money.... The laser does not project on to the ground, so it is useless on an outside putting green becuase you would never be able to see the laser."
1,putter laser pointer does not work,"Received the Item loose in the shipping package with no paperwork and no instructions to use the item. The Item was not boxed and it had some sticky substance on it like a price sticky had been removed. The item does not work. I would recommend that you never buy from New Harbor! They also never sent an email notice when it shipped. I've sent them an email - I will see how they respond.The Item is ""Golf Putter Red Laser Pinter""Contacted vendor and they had me send them a picture of the item. After that, they asked me to return the item. I don't have confidence that it will work anyway so I asked them to just send the instructions and packaging and the correct batteries.I bet they won't do anything except ask me to take the time to return the item.You never want to order from this company!"
4,Movie soundtrack Muir,I simply enjoy this type music. I just love the haunting melodies. It is a great addition to my collection.
5,Fantastic Movie,The movie was outstanding and the soundtrack is even better. If you love the classics and appreciate the music behind the movie then this is an incredible CD.
5,IN MEMORIUM,"I agree wholeheartedly with the two reviews already here. I just wanted to add that Madame Souliotis passed away on December 6 of last year. She was 61, which by today's life spans is very young. I wondered if any music reviewers were aware of any details of her death, if she was ill or if this was sudden.I wish that Decca had been a little less stingy with this album, and also included the arias that made up Side 4 of Madame Souliotis' recording of Cavalleria Rusticana with Mario del Monaco. (I believe ""Pace, pace"" among others were included). There was plenty of time left on this CD for more material. And even though they are extermely flawed, her studio recordings of Macbeth, Anna Bolena and Cavalleria should be more easily available.[P.S.: Souliotis' recording of Cavalleria is due for reissue by Decca in the coming months.]"
4,"Unique concept, well done!","Nice theme - take readers through the standard sections of the average department store, whether it be modest to moderately priced (Target) or higher end (Barneys).Then show them how to adapt the standard lamps, sofas, etc...to the rooms of their choice, creating a unique style and vision. A great starting point for those who aren't sure of their decorating expertise!"
5,Lots of Ideas,I like this book because it has all different styles briefly shown in this book. They also give color schemes to creating that particular style. This book is full of bright colors and good ideas but it should not be thought of as a how to guide. I would recomend this book if you don't know what your style is or if you want a variety of different styles.
2,Lower than expected,"This is a film by Director Fabio de Agostini that goes in the direction of Tinto Brass's Salon Kitty. The plot of Red Nights remains interesting with some good attempts to go ""serious"" at times. However, these aspects collide with a relatively poor acting and the gratuity of nudity and sexuality, elements that take the movie to the exploitation B-side. Nothing wrong with that, except that the the film falls short on the exploitation realm of B-movies. Most violence you get here comes from some Gestapo guys machine gun shooting some plotting business men and the women asked to uncover them while spending some days (and nights) on a castle. You have female nudity, yet sex is far from explicit. Overall then, a mid way between A- and B-film that would not please to any of these viewers.Technically, this Exploitation Digital release comes in widescreen image format. The audio comes in Italian (with English subtitles) and in English. Extras include some trailers."
4,Red Nights,"I liked it.Well made European film.I didn't find it cheezy, had interesting historical story line.Oh, nazi uniforms, sex and naked chicks too."
3,Not the same as Hard Copy,"Interesting material, but the kindle edition does not contain the appendix material in the hard copy which my teacher referred to for homework :("
2,"Another Album, Another Disappointment","After the truly awful 'Stand' and 'The Creed', I didn't have too high hopes for this recent release from Avalon. Thankfully the tendency to over sing songs and the heavy handed, rock orientated production that marred these previous two releases has been toned down a little - albeit not enough.Although I miss the sparkle of albums such as their 2001 'Oxygen' release, there are some reasonable songs here that are worthy of a mention. These include the title track, 'Place In The World' and ' Thy Word'.A reworking of one of their biggest hits 'Testify To Love' does seem a little pointless and hints that this talented foursome may be running out of fresh ideas."
2,Not exactly what I was expecting,"This album was not much more than noise. The singing is a little too strong at times and the background sounds like rock music, which to me is not pleasing to listen to. I actually liked a few of the songs from the Creed and from Stand, but I didn't really care for any of the songs from this album because they were so over produced."
4,Classic Avalon,Avalon is one of my favorite contemporary Christian groups. Avalon has a very distinct and recognizable sound to all of their cd's and this one is no exception. It has some old songs mixed in with some new one's also and will be a great addition to your collection of Christian music.
5,"Unique, Powerful, Evocative","Now that's not to say that this is a plug and play disc. It isn't. There's a few cuts (say 6 out of 26 total cuts) that could have been left off (in my opinion). But the majority of the disc is beyond exceptional.I like to pride myself on listening to artists who don't really sound like anybody else. Bobby 'Blu' definitely falls into that category. His voice is at times smoothe as velvet and at others displays a coarseness that lends itself to the pain that the blues is meant to evoke. Together they make a perfect combo.Chains of Love, Who will the next fool be, Downhearted Blues, I'll take care of you, Yield not to temptation... and the list goes on and on. Just some great material. It's a can't miss disc. BUY IT!"
5,Impressive!,"The truth is, I bought this hair dryer mainly because it looked so cute, but also because it is one of the few travel dryers that have an ionizer. I usually don't buy products that nobody has reviewed, so I actually took a chance on this one, and I have been impressed ever since! It is tiny, light weight and powerful with on/off button for the ionizer and 2 speed settings. It has only one heat setting, so after drying the hair on full blast, you can still get heat when you want to style with less airflow. After I got this, my other hair dryer died, so I have been using this one almost every day for the last 6 months and I still love it! It even comes with its own little travel pouch! So, if you are traveling, this one is ideal!Definitely a keeper..."
3,Different,"I don't even know why I ordered this book - but it was very different reading about a murder way back in Chinese history. I read alot, about 5 books a week - and different is good."
5,Great Book for Kids!!!,"I have this book and I am thirteen, a more ""adult"" age, but I love it! It is touching to read, and the pages are great with drawings and fantastic color! This book is wonderful, especially for children with imagination! I recommend this book to any parent or kid who loves great tales and dogs! It is imply wonderful! Buy this book now!"
2,Meh...not that great,"First of all, I have to say that the only reason this got two stars is because I thought the premise was very interesting (althought not well executed) and the cinematogrophy (that is defintely spelled wrong) was fantastic. Other than that, was boring....almost fast forwarded to the end, but was worried that maybe I would miss something profound.....no such luck. Was very disappointed..."
1,Great Sleeping Aid,"This movie literally put me to sleep. Must've been the unbelievable, idiotic script and the half-asleep acting of the main character (Anne). I'm glad I rented this for ""free"" with Amazon Prime. Otherwise I'd be screaming for my money back. Good night."
2,Typical horror schlock that force feeds us the same old scenarios,"The creators of this movie are honestly insulting our intelligence. After half way through this movie I couldn't take anymore. I place this movie in the same waste basket as the new version of the Hitcher and Wolf Creek. It has the same elements. The usual car that doesn't start, the chances for the victims to escape that aren't taken for some odd reason, the retarded people that walk right up to the criminals so they can kill them. To top it all off, it has the girl run out of gas after she starts the truck. As though they want us to believe that the workers in the woods didn't notice that fact that they wouldn't have had enough gas to made it back themselves! Enough. I will not be insulted. At least give an effort to think of the things people just aren't going to do, and situations that aren't going to happen."
1,A total waste of time and money,"Very bad acting, unreal scenario already seen again and again.Save your money and time and try something else."
2,whats up with all the overembelished reviews,"Ive been lookin for some good instructional dvds. I must say idont understand the five stars. The girl is never fully nude.She never takes her top off. WTF. Secondly, she not shaved.She's all hairy. Thirdly, she's not that cute. The dvd is short, all her finger, nothing hear on tongue technique or nothing like that. It barely even seemed like she ever came to much of a orgasm. She never really even picks up the pace. I'mkinda pissed cause I spent like 25 bucks on this. I feel like this is just a piece of what i was expecting."
1,Robbed....,This is without a doubt the worst waste of money I have ever spent. The dvd was terrible.......
1,Boring,Don't waste your money. I should have gone on to page two of the reviews. There were a lot of good reviews for this video. I don't know why. This video is boring. The woman does the same stroke throughout the whole video with her top on the entire time. You don't need this video to explore your pleasure.
5,Excellent view of the key to a woman's pleasure,This video is excellent. It is wonderful to see the details of a woman in orgasm. I especially like the section where it shows the states of engorgement she experience during her orgasmic experience. Very enlightening.
2,Honestly..I was a little bored,"I bought this video to give my BF a better idea of what I needed from him during foreplay..I knew it was instructional but hoped it'd at least be kinda sexy...it is not. The woman- average looking- doesn't move a muscle beyond the top portion of her index finger. The video is aptly titled as she does NOTHING but touch her clitoris and nothing else, not even other parts of her vagina. I could definitely see how this video would be helpful for women trying to get comfortable with their sexuality/bodies. However, as a woman who already feels very comfortable in that department, I got nothing out of this, and I don't want to show it to my boyfriend b/c he won't get a good overview of how to handle other parts of the vulva as well..."
5,Simple and fun,"Another great female masturbation video that shows how to have pleasure every time. Simple, sexy and a huge turn-on.I owned the collection and love it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"For $30 per copy, you're wasting a dollar a minute plus your time for this brief and simple look of this one girl masturbating.One thing I will guarantee is that I will never ever play or use this DVD again. I am even quite embarassed to say that I purchased it. Let me stop you from buying this video before you make the worst purchasing decision of your life.There is nothing new or instructional here. You won't learn a thing from this video. All you get to do is watch her masturbate. I thought I was going to learn something new to use on my partner. But I didn't learn a thing.BE WARNED. THIS DVD OF LOW PRODUCTION VALUE AND HAS NO INSTRUCTION IN IT WHAT SO EVER. ONE WORD TO DESCRIBE IT IS TERRIBLE."
2,How About Something Different,"How Many Videos Have they made on the Masterbation Subject?Sometimes A Theme can be overdone! How About Something DifferentThis is an over rated video and there may be some value however, it is way too expensive for the little value you get. There are far better videos and martial books (not to mention cheaper) that can teach you many aspects of female orgasm as oppose to this video focusing on one aspect of female orgasm.How About Something Different, For Instance The Art Of Oral is just as important and takes the same if not more skill. They should make a comprehensive tutorial for womenon how to perform oral ( on male and female )Hey How about a Different Theme For change! It just might boost sales!"
1,is there a zero stars rating?,"Don't waste your money! I'll glady give you mine! At $29 per copy, you're paying more than a dollar a minute for this short, simple, look at one type of orgasm from one woman. And I'll bet I never put it in the DVD player again. Every stroke she uses is obvious and built in to every human body. Nothing new here. I thought I was going to learn some tricks or secret strokes. NOPE! color changes, engorgement, other signs-you are not missing anything!I wish I would have payed attention to the other 1 star ratings!"
4,"Good war film, great Gina","NEVER SO FEW was Gina Lollobrigida's first film shot in Hollywood (BEAT THE DEVIL,TRAPEZE and SOLOMON & SHEBA were all shot in Europe), and her arrival to star with Frank Sinatra in this picture was a very exciting event. She should have been given more screen time, but this is an action film intended for a male audience that cares little for romance. So her appearances are always somewhat episodic and her character remains undeveloped. Sturges stages the action sequences very well, the male cast is splendid (especially Richard Johnson and Steve MacQueen), the South East Asian locations are wonderful and atmospheric. Sinatra is always interesting on screen but he does not seem to be very involved in the project. Gina does what she is asked to do, and she does it well. We warm up to her character as the film progresses. At any rate, Lollobrigida was gorgeous-looking in 1959. What a woman!"
2,good old 1940 movies,I was disappointed in this movie. I've seen a lot of the older 1940's war movies and they are always intertaining with good plots. This was lacking in action and acting. It turned out to be more theatrical. Not worth seeing in my opinion.
3,What's the beef with Gina?,"Never So Few has a good cast, great cinematography, and a terrific Hugo Friedhofer score. It also has Gina Lollobrigida at her most beautiful. I can't understand why there are so many complaints about her in these reviews. She does what she needs to do most admirably. Seems she has always been under appreciated. I thought the romantic scenes were a good contrast with the war sequences."
1,Only for Steve McQueen Diehards...,"Sorry to say this as I like most movies, but the only reason to purchase this movie (wish I had read my own review before I bought it) would be to make sure you have every second of Steve McQueen's screen work. As another reviewer wrote, the romance truly messes with the plot, despite the obvious charms of the leading lady. The only two bright spots are the McQueen bits where he is his usual flip and resourceful self and the scene where Frank soaks his dirty and perhaps cruddy feet in whiskey. Battle scenes on sets, poorly developed personalities of the local hero warriors, and so many plot lines left hanging, like what happened to Gina's man Nick who states that he is not a good loser? Maybe they were planning a sequel where Nick takes Frank down? And Gina is in Intelligence? Hell Is For Heroes is SO much better."
2,Boring,"All that wonderful cinematography appears to be shot with the 2nd unit. All the action in which the actors are recognizable takes place on a movie set that reminds me of an expensive version of the Bonanza set. Sinatra and Mcqueen have good performances. But the director, writer, and producer did a lousy job! Maybe they made this movie to capitalize on the success of The Bridge on the River Kwai."
1,Never So Few,"I never received my DVD. After waiting the time frame given for delivery, I had to contact the seller for status. It was never mailed out to me. As they say ""You pay for what you get"". This included service."
3,Not so bad afterall...,"Yeh, there's some nudity, yeh, there's some violence, but even so, the story still kept me riveted. In fact, other than the b-rated overall production quality, I actually liked the script and plot. Not bad for a low-budget project with b-list actors. I would recommend this for purchase."
2,Familiarity is this flick's only saving grace.,"""Expose"" is undoubtedly more concerned with five minute sex and shower scenes than it is with plot. I have nothing against gratuitous nudity, but this movie's taking things a little far. Starting out as a typical B movie, its overt use of nudity as a viewer attractant begins in the opening credit sequence. It plays like a comic political thriller, desperately trying to hold onto its plot for the first half of the film. At the halfway point, it seems to almost give up, and extinguishes the nudity with a marked regression into blatantly visceral violence, characterized by guns, rape, death, and orange brain matter everywhere. Ah, the American dream reaches fruition. The only reason to watch this movie is if you happened to go to college with its star, Tracy Tutor. If that's the case, you'll enjoy her cinematic debut, which essentially is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Enjoy. Or don't."
3,rollin goes average,This is my fourth Rollin film I see and it's not the best I've seen so far. But it has some moments of surreal poetry that is Rollin trademark.Gorehounds should stay away but die hard Rollin fans should pick this up.
2,Very disappointed,The package arrived on time but when I open it I thought it was a joke. The night light is only picture of basset hound in plastic cover. I was expecting plastic night light shape as basseet hound. This was not worth price I paid. I would not recommend buying this product!!!!!!
2,"Cute Board, But Not Very Strong",Very cute board that your daughter will love but it's not built to last. It cracked right down the middle (luckily at the end of the summer) in the exact same spot as a friend's board. Coincidence? Or bad design? Spend the extra money and buy a real Boogie Board that will last through the years.
5,good quality gasket,I used this gasket with a new Walker muffler for my 1997 Chevrolet Venture. It sealed the flange joint and there were no leaks.
1,same as World Encyclopedia,Exact same book as The World of Encyclopedia of Cacti and Succlents. Spent like 34 bucks for the two. Trying to return now. Nicely laid out but not what expected. Ive seen the new version to this book. Hopefully it is more updated. I just didnt keep it when I got it at the bookstore. But considering it now. The one I really like is Cacti and Succulents and Illustrated encyclopedia with the black cover.
5,Awesome,"This Product is an actual local product for me little did i know until, My boxer was gone for 7 days and came home and she had been sprayed. I tried all the others and this and the other skunk off product got the smell off instantly."
5,A THOUGHT FROM AN OLD FRIEND OF MARC'S,"This novel was a masterpiece. I grew up with Marc and we shared most of the same friends through High School, and we competed viciously to be recognized and loved by our peers. I hope through time and experiences we all have learned to be better people and more so better adults. This book will slam you back into the past and hopefully deliver you into the future. I really had no idea about the situations you witnessed as a child and young adult. I know your book made me realize the good and bad that I brought into peoples lives back in High School. Although we did not keep in touch after High School I am very proud of your accomplishments and I wish you well"
3,Your Hura,"In general, I like these Star Trek action figures. The detail on the faces always looks very realistic; perhaps they were modeled with a laser scan of the actual actors' faces. These are well-constructed figures but I wish they would stand up better by themselves on their own two feet. And I wish the Uhura figure had ""real"" (fake) hair, as opposed to her hair being part of the plastic mold of her head. $20 is a bit expensive, however."
3,Okay CD,I didn't like most of this CD as too many of the musical scores seemed overly laden with Hercules' main theme. Because of this few of the pieces had the originality & the strength to really capture my interest. The only ones I really liked were Cute Harpies and Festival of Ghouls. These two songs were the reason I gave it 3 stars.
1,Doesn't receive well,I installed this in a friend's car and it has been a problem since I put it in. Reception is poor and the remote is poorly designed due to the way the battery fits in it. You actually have to open the remote and bend the contacts to the battery from time to time. I have a Valet 561R which can be obtained cheaper online and works as advertised.
5,What a swell album!,"This album is The Vandals best. Every song on there is good and none of the songs sound the same. Warren Fitzgereld is one of the best guitar players of punk music, also they are one of the best bands live."
4,Good Stuff,"First got on board with the Vandals with ""Peace Through Vandalism."" I hadn't heard anything from them for years, until I caught a snippet of ""Live Fast"" on the X-files back in the day. I didn't know it was the Vandals until years later when Amazon put together this invaluable music search tool that helped me figure out who it was. This album is F-A-S-T! It's also whitty and the band sounds more capable musically than they did on earlier stuff. Worth the nickle!"
5,laughing at you people...,"...but anyway...this is probably their last good CD...the 2after this one are alright, but this one is actually good...I recomendgoing to some thier older stuff...Fear of A Punk Planet or Peace Through Vandalism are both great CDs and I highly recomend them...Fear even has some Zappas and Kelsey Grammer on it...thought those were neat...but hell, who cares what kind of music it is ""supposed to be""....what is ""Punk"" anyway?...these guys make good music and have been one of my favorite bands since I saw them few years back...any of thier stuff come highly recomended by me"
3,superior writing but didn't like the story...,"Mary Balogh is an excellent writer-the storyline is what I just could not get past.Denby offered young working companion Harriet carte blanche (to become his mistress) 6 years before. She refused and went on to marry a gentle, kind duke who sadly died after four years.The story there begins. Frankly, I had hope that Denby would be a stand up guy, he almost does, but Harriet, believing he'll never marry her, offers to have an affair. He should have stopped her and declared his love-instead,he proceeds to have the affair with her-and become betrothed to another at the same time. I don't want to see that in a regency romance-but that's just me, you may want to try it for yourself.3.5 stars for good writing if not a good story."
4,works like it should based on price,It already has a cracked filter component but works OK. would buy again. Price was reasonable compared the the local sources.
1,Not worth the trouble,"The first thing that struck me was the picture quality ..it stinks !! ..I really don't know what the fuss is all about with dvd.. but anyway, the movie itself has an average story line however, the heavenly creatures that appear from time to time makes up for it"
2,Not helpful at ALL,"I used this book in my japanese class and I took about every test inside. Well, I was confident after taking the tests and was sure I would do good on the SAT. But imagine my surprise when I went to the test center, looked at the test and saw that it was almost completely different. What was significantly different was the reading comprehensions. In the book they provide short passages which have kanji, but provide the easier hiragana on top; on the SAT however there is a lot of kanji, and they DO NOT provide hiragana. I was almost completely lost on the real test. Barron provided me only with a false sense of security."
5,Beautifully Written Treatise,"This book is a beautifully written treatise on man-legislated law in the Roman Catholic Church today. It includes an invaluable historical perspective that could be complete all on its own. Father McKenna uses the ever controversial issues of confidentiality, marriage annulment and human rights, to explore the concepts of law underlying the complex workings of this universal church. Catholic Canon Law, set out in the Code of Canon Law, is probably the only universal system of law in the world. Despite the global nature and dimensions of our world today, that is a complicated concept. This dessertation sets out the map for the basic concepts and leaves the reader hoping Father McKenna explores more such issues in the future."
5,Fun Movie,Fun Movie. I got it to replace a damaged disk that I have in my collection. I wish my school dazy were like this...
2,Cheap Steam Collector,The Sunpentown SC-0720 has a cheap steam collector cup made of brittle plastic that is supposed to slide and grip a rounded portion of the body under the lid hinge. It cracks with frequent use and the company will sell you another for $5.
1,The Truth About BLOOD HARVEST,"Films Around The World, Inc. (FATW)acted as exclusive international sales agent for Buddys, Inc., which furnished completion money for the original production company of BLOOD HARVEST,The Shooting Ranch Ltd. The production company went bankrupt and an FATW affiliate purchased the negative, outtakes, the right to use the screenplay, and all related rights, from the Trustee in Bankruptcy. FATW licensed the original version to The Drive In Channel; the movie has never been licensed for video by the copyright owner. It will all be straightened out by the Courts, but for sure, when it is legitimately released, the technical quality will be first-rate, and there will be no unauthorized cuts. ALL present video versions are unauthorized, of inferior technical quality, and not as complete as the original version."
3,Good Family Film,A classic family film where good triumphs over evil. A bit over-acted but an interesting story line of adventure and a little romance. A great gift for Grandma and Grandpa and a lot of the older Moms and Dads.
3,Time is a Thief!!!!!!!!,Films are an escape from reality. What a pity the film world is not real. Because the present world means that we will not go to hell. Mankind has made it that way.
5,JATA + TTM + MI + TDTESS + JTTCOTE = SCIFI HEAVEN,"First Jason and the Argonauts, The Time Machine, Mysterious Island; and finally BOTH The Day the Earth Stood Still and Journey to the Centre of the Earth, released on the same day!! And all in glorious letterbox (except TDTESS; it's in a class of it's own). Journey to the Centre of the Earth is great fantasy movie for for the whole family with beautiful photography and a fantastic musical score provided by THE composer of all time, Bernard Herrmann. A perfect addition to any scifi collection."
5,Still a great classic,"First saw this when I was still a kid, and I still enjoy it. One thing I didnt see on the dvd was a blooper where the giant lizards are attacking an injured one, and you could see a quick shot of a thumb and finger of the person holding the lizard."
5,Excellent!,This item was purchased for my husband who is really into this type of movie. The remake just doesn't compare!
4,Journey To The Center Of The Earth DVD,Still a great family classic. DVD format makes it all the better.Fast delivery.
5,A good adaptation of Jules Verne's novel,"James Mason, Pat Boone, and duck named Gertrude--how can you go wrong?! Even though the special effects were a little hokey at times, the acting was very good, and it gave me just enough of a 'spook' to be fun (and not too much to not be able to go to bed right away!). Good Saturday night family fare."
3,Environmentally damaging DVD Case,"The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.The case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.I like the movie."
3,Wholesome family fun,"Overall if you like films like 20,000 leagues under the sea, then you may want to try out Journey to the Centre of the Earth which is an old classic family adventure that even has a pet duck called Gertrude that goes along with Prof. Lindenbrook (James Mason) and his expedition to the centre of the earth.It is a slow trip and not much of the movie stands the test of time (just look at the film's title) but it is still entertainment and there are various action sequences with a budget that have even influenced and impressed the likes of Spielberg (see the boulder dash in Raiders for example).This Jules Verne's adaptation was a blockbuster for its time. Overall you know that you are watching it for its unintentional silliness and in that respect it does amuse. Just don't go expecting a logical film and enjoy it for what it is... wholesome family fun that doesn't make you think too hard about anything."
3,Well . . .,"When all is said and done, there's nothing like seeing a naked Pat Boone with a sheep. Think I'm kidding? It's right after the escape through the volcano vent at the end of the film; Pat is blown through the air, lands in a tree (sans clothes) and grabs the nearest thing - a sheep in this case - to hide his shame from some passing nuns. Given his future conservative leanings, this is rich!"
2,This is my boyfriend's favorite movie,"The title of my review pretty much tells it all. I watched it with him a year or so ago because I love him. In my opinion, that would be the only reason to watch this film -doing it for the love of another."
4,AWESOME!,What an imagination (or was it?). Even today you can put yourself in their shoes. Only Pixar could do justice to a modern remake (yes I know it's been remade). Brendan Fraser was fine in The Mummy...but a Jewels he is not.
4,As great as I remember,I purchased this movie because it is one of many I remember enjoying as I was growing up. Watching it again on DVD after a hiatus of many years I can safely say that it still holds my interest. I recommend this movie to anyone with the same nostalgia as me.
4,A heck of a ride,"As one the first full length 3d movies, the movie provides vivid color and scene and a decent story- A Fun ride. Solely for cinematic purposes, characters are thrown into fantastical colorful worlds.- Story is decent. Very disney-like: obstacles and issues and then a happpy ending.Overall, not many strong morals/themes are enforced, but entertaining for 2 hours. Don't expect too much out of this movie."
3,"run, lizard, run","As a kid I would wait for this to appear on Million Dollar Movie on T-V. But, man, was it ever a long wait to get to the opening of the earth. Spinning on the magnetic pole was thought provoking. My favorite part, of course, was the giant lizard with the sail on its back. Now that's entertainment. Eating the duck was a heartbreaker from which my cousin never fully recovered."
5,A score that gives visions of the underworld.,"Bernard Herrmann's score for this film is just perfect for it. The complete brass section brings out the terror and beauty of the places in the center of the Earth. Jimmy Van Heusen's music was also very beautiful, and I'm so glad that they added in the two other deleted songs. Herrmann used almost the same arrangement that he did when he composed for Jason and The Argonauts. All brass and woodwinds, harp, no strings, but the only thing that he didn't use for Jason and The Argonauts was the organ, which brought a chilling feeling to the dangers of the area. The inventiveness for track 18 was perfect for the chameleon scene, but you kind've have to laugh at the way it sounds. It matches exactly what the linear notes say in the booklet. This is an absolute must for Herrmann fans."
5,James Mason stars in the Jules Verne Sci-fi Classic.,Journey to the Center of the Earth with Professor Lindenbrook (James Mason) and his geology student (Pat Boone). The classic beauty of Arlene Dahl has been added as the love interest. Stunningly beautiful scenes of the underearth realm are filled with variety. There are scenes such as Lindenbrook and his student companion finding themselves in an eiderdown storehouse that add a touch of comedy. James Mason's dynamic personality really shines through in his magnificent portrayal of Professor Lindenbrook. This is an adventure to be enjoyed again and again.
1,Journey To The Center Of The Earth,"Having seen this movie many times over the years and enjoyed it each time, I think it should be rated one of the classics of its time."
5,the best,"I'm just finishing up reading Journey to the Interior of the Earth (thanks, Project Gutenberg), which led me to looking for the DVD of the fondly remembered James Mason/Arlene Dahl movie, which I watched countless times years ago.I think the movie improved on the plot of the book (sorry, Jules Verne), by adding in the magnificent Arlene Dahl, and James Mason was always a pleasure to watch and added dimensions to the Professor character that were not there in the book. I still mourn poor Gertrude and feel fury at her murderer. Peter Ronson (Hans) apparently decided not to pursue a film career, which I think is a loss for us, if not for him.My recollection of the special effects is that they were superb, and the DVD lives up to that. There is a great deal to be said for the special effects in this movie and Forbidden Planet vs. the Lego-like stuff that passes for special effects in Star Wars, for example, which also drowns out the characters."
4,Good Adventure Story for the Kids,"I remember this from my childhood watching ""Family Classics"" with host Frasier Thomas on WGN TV. It has some gripping adventure for the young, as the lead character races against a murderous rival to be the first to reach the center of the earth. It does plod along at some points, and you don't get to the good stuff until mid-movie, but it is worth the price of admission."
3,Centered Movie,Wonderful movie of the early science fiction genre of Jules Verne. A must see if you have been bombarded by the lackluster remakes as seen on TV.
5,Spelunkers Delight,"The best cave exploring movie you will ever see not to mention a great and magical adaptation of a Jules Verne book. The 1999 remake of this was a joke by comparison. This is by far one of the greatest family movies ever. If you enjoy movies like Mysterious Island (1961), 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), and Swiss Family Robinson (1960) you will absolutely love it. Even measured against todays effect wizards like Industrial Light & Magic's standards this is a great movie. See the crystal cave, dinosaurs, and giant mushrooms and see if you don't agree. Consider it was made almost 45 years ago and you will be truly amazed. The beautiful scenery and sets are just one facet. The acting and Bernard Herrmann score is superb. The story of a student buying his professor a gift that leads to a discovery of how to journey to the center of the earth is fantastic. A must see and own movie. I preordered my copy on DVD."
3,Busted,"I've been through two sets of these. I treated these phones with the utmost care and they both ended up shorting out in one ear. The first set actually developed a ""rupture"" of the rubber near the earbud. The second set ($100 to Sure for a replacement) just started shorting out last week. They need to create stronger cords for these. Maybe a cord of tapered thickness from the earbud connection. This is just unacceptable design for high end phones. I've switched to another brand."
3,"Not what I ordered, but good follow-up.","Gave me the wrong pair of earphones.The items arrived in perfect condition though, but again, not what I ordered.Also, the $5.00 refund is a nice thought, but when both earbuds cost close to $200.00 (totaling to $400.00), it's not saying much. Appreciate them following-up, nonetheless."
1,Don't buy these for music,Bought these because they were supposed to have the same sound quality as the Shure E4 but with a shorter cord. Wrong. Music is almost unrecognizable through these phones. No bass response whatsoever out of an i-pod.
5,Great suggestions,"When I was listening to the beginning of this book on tape - my thoughts were - this is nothing new, I've heard all of this before. But that changed as I got further into it. I've read a lot about public speaking and I assist in teaching High Impact Presentation courses for the Dale Carnegie organization, so I've heard a lot of advice on giving presentations. This book on tape was definitely worth my time and I've recommended it to others."
1,Would not hold water,"I filled it, attached the tube and inverted the bottle as it should be in use, then the water just steadily dripped. I gave it a while thinking it might need some time for the atmospheric pressure to balance out; nope, it just leaks won't quit.It will go back. Everything else seemed top drawer; what a shame."
1,This bottle could kill your pet! Please do not buy!!,"Please do not buy this bottle!! I bought two for my pet rats (one as a spare) and deeply regretted it. Two days after I attached the first water bottle to the cage, I noticed the water level hadn't gone down at all, so I tapped the ball with my finger and no water came out! I tried to refill it, shake it, etc and nothing worked. It would drip a little at first but then it would lock up and not let any water escape after a few seconds or minutes. So I tried the 2nd spare bottle I bought - same thing happened! Please do not waste your time or money on these bottles- if you're not careful, your pet could die from dehydration!"
1,Very Unhappy,This bottle was very hard to attach to the cage. I cannot fill it more than a quarter full or it just slides down the side no matter how tight I attach it. It also leaks a lot. I have to put a dish under it and I frequently find it overflowing and soaking the habitat floor. I sent the company an email to their customer service and never even got a response. I own hundreds of dollars of super pet stuff and am very happy with all of it except this horrible bottle.
5,awsome water bottle,It is a great water bottle. the little duck inside is lovely for telling how much water is left. Also it turned out to be alot bigger than i thought it would be. I love it
2,50/50,"One bottle was fine, the other was poorly machined and the valve/spout started to leak pretty quickly. Rabbits were thirsty cuz of this malfunction. The plastic is not the same grade you are used to with the Lixit bottles. Buy them instead."
1,What Is Up WIth This?,This water bottle does not work. It leaks. It does not attach to cage properly. I have tried and tried and tried. Sad! Loved the duck (hence the 1 star).
3,"A big mistake: this is not at all ""at the Vapors Club""!","This is an inexplicable mistake of the record label, Ace Records. In fact these 12 recordings were a part of Show 2 recorded live at The Palomino, Hollywood, California, in June 18, 1979, and were originally issued asthe vinyl album SCR 785 ""Six of One, Half Dozen of the Other: Recorded Live in Concert"". See the discography in""Jerry Lee Lewis & Charles White - Killer! The Baddest Rock Memoir Ever"" (Century - Random House, London, 1995), pages 215 and 217.The concert of Jerry Lee Lewis in the Vapors Club took place for his 55th birthday - September 29, 1990,- and was not yet released."
4,"Good, but wish I had my book from prague","This book is great for those who do not have a great book on Mucha. The book contains a superior history of Mucha's life and intro the Art Neuvou period(Art Nuvo). Mucha should be credited with the entire period in my opinion.There is wide sampling of his works, beyond that in other books. There are examples of jewelry, metal works, paintings, prints, furniture, and architecture. The images are printed very well.All in all, this is the second best book; The best book was purchased in Prague at his museum (can't find in US...or remember name). This book had mostly paintings but I miss the superior color quality and few pictures run across two pages (a pet peeve of mine and occasional issue in this book)...this book seems to be as good as it gets here."
5,one of my favorites,"This book is big and bright. tons of full page Mucha artworks. I love Mucha, he's a game changer in the art world in every sense of the expression. This book has definitely done a good job representing all his work with excellent reproduction of a great collection. if you're new to Mucha, I can't recommend this book more. if your'e a seasoned Mucha lover, I can't imagine another book with better representation of his work."
1,Floor Sweepings,"Save your money! I know true bluegrass fans are always looking for new DVD releases, as there are so few bluegrass compilations on the market. But this collection is dreadful. It consists mostly of clips from old local TV programs, with grainy video and pre-MTS quality audio. And as if the lack of quality wasn't enough, there is also a lack of quantity. The length is billed as ""60 Minutes"", but it measured more like 48 minutes on my DVD player."
3,For Commodore fans,"You need to be a Commodore fan to really enjoy this. If you are, you will !! It's not too bad, but I can't see non-fans fully appreciating theses talented musicians."
1,Ball went through net and hit my neighbor's roof.,"While practicing with my driver, I hit a ball in the center of the net but the net gave way and the ball kept going. The ball went over my fence, across the street, and hit my neighbor's roof. Luckily, I did not hit anyone. I only had the net for a few weeks and did not expect the net to break so easily."
1,0 stars,This is a piece of junk. I'm surprised at Golf Digest for putting their name on this. Don't bother with it. Directions are as bad as they can be and the thing can't stand up on it's own. Trust me- steer clear of this.
2,Hit right through it!,"We were so excited to buy this net... it seemed like we would have a bigger target to hit. I used to hit over our other, cheaper one. After a week, we discovered that we were hitting right through it! We now have three holes in it! We cannot seem to find a phone number or web site to contact the company. We don't live near a Target to return it. It is a piece of junk! I guess that we will have to keep duct taping the holes."
1,WRONG Track Listing!!!! BEWARE!!!!,"If the track listing listed here is the one for Crazy Life, then I'm Greta Garbo! ALL THESE TRACKS ARE FOR THE ALBUM ""POWERFUL PEOPLE."" Again, this track listing is INCORRECT and is not the track listing for ""Crazy Life.""The CORRECT track listing for the album ""Crazy Life"" is as follows:1. CRAZY LIFE2. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY3. THERE'S NO TIME4. FLING OF MINE5. GRANNY GOODBYE6. GREAT LAKE CANOE7. CHERIZAR8. ONE WOMAN LOVER9. PIANO SONGSooo, BEWARE, the track listing listed for this album is NOT the track listing for the album ""Crazy Life,"" which I have correctly listed for you above. Hopefully this is just a mistake and the actual ""Crazy Life"" album will include the CORRECT songs listed above. Be sure to verify before you purchase. Thanks!"
3,"The first in a series. Tune in, chill-out, and swing.","The first of three 'Songs For The Jet Set' CD series, all in all, lounge music to sooth the soul and calm the senses. For what it's worth, a nice compilation of breezy jazz-like tunes, quaint and delicate, with a touch of swinging Euro-kisch. The songs tend to alternate between Burt Bacharach's aural-prozac and shuffling bossanova rhythms (with Astrud Gilberto-ish vocals) and a coating of fluffy Brian Wilson/Sean O'Hagan type arrangements. Thrown into the mix are the cloud-flights of The Fifth Dimension, Stereolab's doo-wop harmonies, and kischy guitar grooves. The songs go from inducing a romantic cool to hipster suave, the soundtrack to catch gentle Parisian breezes while sitting at an outdoor cafe."
2,Lousy and crude attempt to capture a genre............,"This is a desparately weak collection of clumsily produced kitsch wannabe pap. A couple of the instrumental only tracks nearly work (hence the generous two stars), but the vocal tracks are truly lousy. Really disappointing if you are a looking for any subtlety - best look somewhere else. Try Michel Legrand, Francis Lai, a bit of Mancini perhaps....the originals are unbeatable, so why try to get anywhere near them with this dire pastiche? Caveat Emptor!Update: It's now 9/2006 and it still sounds grim!"
5,fabu,"Mr. Orange is enough to make this a worthy CD. And Barbarella. The Christmas song is stupid, but like I say Mr. Orange more than makes up for all of it."
3,"Very good performance, bad video","I thought the performance was considerably better than Kevin Filipski gives it credit for in the Amazon review. I found it to be sincere, competent, and frequently moving. The concertmistress seemed moved almost to tears in her long and beautiful solo. But what spoils this is the egotistical camera work, which generally manages to be where the action is not (e.g. a brain-dead long shot on the tenor's opening Kyrie) and the obtrusive and distracting lighting changes that are nothing short of criminal."
1,Slim pickings,"This is basically a textbook, quite dry and academic, except for the author's occasional slips of mild witticism which occasionally make up an entire chapter (usually when she was unable to come up with any hard information). I found this admirable for its obvious effort, but ultimately unsatisfying as it offers little to no insight into either Perkins personally, and has a funny tone of proprietariness and prudishness. Also, why the high price? Not worth it. Stick with the biography."
1,Semi-scholarly to mask a dearth of insight,"I opened this book with high hopes, being a huge fan of Tony Perkins, and was disappointed to find it consists largely of flippant remarks/opinions by its author rather than any serious probing or insight into this remarkable theatrical family. As a listing of career moments, it is fine, but as a biography or anything deeper than a roster, it is very thin. Some of the so-called chapters are merely one paragraph long, in which the author says she could not come up with any info."
1,Extremely Poor,"The author didn't do her homework. Ten minutes of Google yields more fruit that this tome. Her appraisal of ""The Ghost Writer"" pilot is particuarly obtuse, as the version she saw was obviously heavily edited unlike the ones currently on view on You Tube. A shabby excuse for a book, devoted to subject matter that deserves better. Understandably, this is now out of print. How it was published in the first place is mystifying."
1,Crap-o-la,"This stuff is crap, it damages your map and even high quality maps wrinkle from using it. It lifts the ink right off the map and smears it around as you spread the product on it."
3,An appetizer mystery,Not a full meal to me. I know why the amateur sleuth did the investigating. That's what they do. What I didn't understand was how everyone was so thrilled with the ideas presented by Max that they just blindly signed whatever he asked them to. All the lawyers had left town with Selma's parents? I kept expecting something awful to happen - total foreclosure on the town by Max's bank maybe. Perhaps the author's saving that up for another book.
3,"Buen material, pero poca calidad","El libro tiene muy buena información, inclusive me ví sorprendido con fotografías originales de fábrica que no conocía. Sin embargo, la calidad de las fotografías es regular y en algunos casos mala, y no contiene ninguna fotografía o ilustración a colores salvo en la tapa y contratapa. Aún así considero que comprarlo valió la pena."
5,Great CD,"I love country and I love Jerry Lee, so this CD really works for me. I have been enjoying listening to it both at home and in the car."
4,AN IMAGINATIVE RETELLING OF A TRADITIONAL STORY,"Hearts will be warmed by this imaginative retelling of the traditional Christmas story. Mr. Foreman's moonlit illustrations are perfect accompaniments for this long ago tale about a cold winter's night.According to the cat who lived in a barn in a distant land it was an exceptionally frigid night. It was so icy that the feline was glad for the warm company of the cows. But just as the cat was growing comfortable the barn doors flew open to admit a man, a woman, and a donkey.Before long the animals heard a baby cry, and then other visitors arrived - shepherds, camels with their masters who were dressed like kings. Oddly enough all of these people knelt in the mud before the baby.That was a night that brought much change to the world, and even to the cat who was in the barn when a baby was born.Young animal lovers will especially enjoy this familiar story told through the eyes of a very observant cat."
3,A Different Colman,"First off, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the ""print"" for this DVD.If you are familiar with most of the popular Ronald Colman movies -- ""Lost Horizon"" and ""Random Harvest"", for example -- be prepared for a shock. In this film, Colman plays a dark role of an actor who declines into insanity and murder. It's such a role reversal, no wonder he got the Academy Award for it! Colman was getting older here -- 57 -- but the golden voice is unmistakeable. I worried this film might never make it to DVD...thank goodness it did."
5,Pure Comfort,"I love these sandals! It's the first time I have spent this much on a pair of shoes, but I wanted a good, quality leather that I wouldn't have to spend years breaking in. Believe me it was worth every penny! They came out of the box new, but feel like I have been wearing them for years. I love these sandals and recommend them to anyone."
5,cute-cute-cute,very cute and comfy. highly recommend. nice sandal that will never go out of style. thinking about getting more in different colors.
2,Really bad squeak!!,"Bough a 2nd pair, thought maybe the first pair was defective. Seems to be a design flaw, though. The sole squeaks loudly with every step. Wast of hard earned money. Big disappointment, they are comfortable, too!"
5,a nice umbrella,I purchased this umbrella 3 years ago from superbackpack and it is still in good shape and now in my 2nd child's hand. And both of my girls and their friends love it.
2,Piicture was decieving,"Leather wallet appeared to be regular type wallet but was a trifold. Has a nice pewter team logo but was not the style pictured. Bought this one and the embroidered one so my husband could decide which one he liked. However this was not the right style and the embroidered one looked cheap. Tried to return this item, bought it 11/27/09 shopping early for xmas. It was given as a gift on 12/25 and it was determined it needed to be returned along with the other wallet (both from Amazon) I was advised I was past the 30 days return policy. Thought there might be some extension to that at the holidays when gift giving but there wasn't. No credit offered toward anything else either. Don't buy this item or shop early at Amazon for xmas if you're not positive you will be happy with your item. I am now stuck with two wallets that are not liked and will not be used."
3,a sci-fi film that`s a cut above the rest in it`s genre,James Caan wasn`t in peak performace here like he was in ROLLERBALL but still he managed to pull of a good performance as a hard nosed cop stuck in a futuristic socitey of unwanted aliens with human qualities. Another highlight is seeing this film in dvd instead the visual graphics and imagrey were much more stunning in this version. The storyline is nothing exceptional a cop goes after his parnter`s killer with the help of an alien cop who he`s forced to work with. Good film to watch but after seeing this film it`s nothing worth remembering.
4,An routine cop-thriller with a unique premise.,"In the future, Aliens that looked like Humans land on earth in Peace and they becoming a society mixed with the Humans. When a cop (James Caan) is teamed with his new partner, which is a Alien named Samuel 'George' Francisco (Mandy Patinkin). Together, they are teamed to ferrot out the Prepetrators of a Series of Mysterious Murders among the aliens.Directed by Graham Baker (Omen:The Final Contact) made This familiar but fascinating Sci-Fi Thriller has it`s good moments. Terrific performances by Caan and Patinkin. This film didn`t do too well at the Box Office but it gained a Cult Following on Video. Followed by T.V. Series and Two made for T.V. Films, based on the T.V. Series. Super 35. Grade:B+."
4,The one that started it all,"This is the original theatrical movie of Alien Nation. If you saw the TV series, this is NOT the pilot!The movie starts out with Matt Sykes (Caan) and his partner Tuggle (Brown) in a shootout. ""Tuggs"" gets killed by an alien criminal... shot right through a car!All the characters are a little different in tone and attitude than the series, and overall, it is a little darker, and more clearly about racism. The characters are compelling, and the look a little more stiff.Most of the story is recycled in the TV pilot, but many of the details change. Mandy Patinkin is considerably more stilted as George than Erik Pierpoint is in the TV series; Eric has a very different take on the character.Stands on its own quite well."
4,the movie that started the series,"i thought this was a great concept. and, i hadn't seen Mandy Patinkin in a movie since ""the princess bride"". the movie doesn't have enough time to really go into detail about the newcomers like the series did but you get enough info to know that they are very different from us. it's more of an action movie than a sci-fi movie because it takes place on earth. these guy's crash landed on our planet and don't have a way to get back home so they try and adapt to our way of life. if you like action with a little bit of comedy and you don't really have to think too much about whats going on, then you'll like this one. it's a fun movie!"
4,A good Sci Fi Movie,While not in my top 10 of Sci Fi movies it is in the top 20 for sure. A nice spin on the age old Cop Buddy Show. An Ageing cop (james Caan) takes on a new buddy in (mandy pantkin) an alien race that has come to our planet. It was good on the movies and it even spawned a tv series. Well worth watching.
4,Almost perfect,"The music is perfect, the only problem is really that the songs are too short. When you listen to it your left wanting to hear more, thats how good it is the music."
4,"A good score, but missing a lot of the score.","L.A. Confidential is one of Jerry Goldsmith's best scores and he might have won the Oscar that year if James Horner hadn't for ""Titanic."" This CD contains only part of the film score and leaves out a lot of the good stuff. Varese Sarabande needs to release an extended version."
3,HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Now that I have your attention, I may need to point out that this will cause heartburn, and plenty of it. I found it best to take a tums beforehand, unless I was just about to eat. However that aside this one does work."
3,"Good, not great...","It is a cut and paste job, and the overall result reflects that. Some of the pieces are rather good. Some are works that are not choral works, and do not lend themselves well to being morphed into a choral piece.If you are looking for a musical experience, then pass on this one. If you are looking for pleasant music in the background that no one really listens too...then you may want to consider."
2,Perfume smelled old,I love Red Door Revealed but this particular product smelled old. I am very disappointed. I know that there is always a risk in ordering online. I guess I should have purchased it from a local store. :(
5,Love the classics!,Great service and order processing. I LOVE my parfum...it's just how I remembered it! It's a discontinued item from the dept. stores so I was VERY glad to find it here and at a bargain! I wear it everyday...light and floral but the smell stays with you! I always get compliments on it.Definitely worth investing in!
3,reviewing an ehtics review,"This book plows familiar ground in many places and can be at times confusing or overly technical. On the other hand, the two chapters that address ethical issues on a case by case basis do a wonderful job of identifying an ethical issue, discussing cases and laws that apply and then making a suggestion for that particular instance or example. I plan to use this text to supplement the Corey and Corey text on ethics for an ethics course for MFT's."
3,Handle came apart,I used a glue gun and then every thing was great. The broom has beem played with every day since
3,Its fun but needs a few improvements!,My 2 yo daughter loves her Sweeping Sam but I don't like the fact that the broom detaches from the sweeper too easily. Her friend (4 yo boy) always disconnects the handle and swings it around like a weapon. Not really safe or ideal for little toddlers that have infant siblings.
3,Hum drum,My 1.5 year old grandson prefers the old fashioned broom. this doesn't do much for him but at least its more manageable as its smaller.
3,If you like so bad it's good - give it a look,"Yep. This one's a stinker - but; we're assuming it was supposed to be.Another Wynorski throwback that has lots of T+A - but it's really forced into the story this time (a shower stall that all the girls must use IN a lingerie warehouse?).The action scenes are poorly directed; the gore terrible - but, Orville Ketchum returns here; and is even more monotone than in the previous entry (this was apparently a sequel to ""Sorority House Massacre 2"").If your idea of a good time are questionable looking women; in and out of clothing chasing down a killer possessed by an evil spirit in a lingerie store - then you've found the golden ticket here!!!The biggest downside, however; is the title. It refers (apparently) to Ketchum's character - which is, sadly, the longest-running and least funny joke in the film. Watch it and you'll see what we mean.BOTTOM LINE: Worth a look for severe camp aficionados"
1,For Vanity Fans Only,"I just watched this low budget drama and to say that it is laughable is an understatement, as a previous reviewer stated the way in which people act when being shot is very funny because these are the some of the worst actors ive seen, the ONLY reason to watch this turkey is if you like Vanity - which is the only reason i watched it, she is fine as Dee Williams girlfriend but she wasnt exactly given challenging material to work with."
5,Fantastic and innovative! One of Goldsmith's all time BEST!,"""Planet of the Apes"" is one of filmdom's most chilling and original scores. The new CD sounds great (you can hear sounds and instruments that weren't audible on previous versions). The newer release also contains more pieces of music that weren't even on the version released several years ago. Included, too, is music from ""Escape from Planet of the Apes"" (also previously unreleased); it is great to hear how he took the themes from ""Planet"" and funked them out for ""Escape"". This is Jerry Goldsmith at his best. Other personal Goldsmith faves... THE OMEN, BASIC INSTINCT, PAPPILON."
5,Unbelievable. No reviews.,"Just plain good stuff. ""Make Your Day""? I mean, come on people! ""Vader""?? ""POSSUM"" for crying out loud!Shreds, there's no doubt."
3,Great music and production - fair sound,"I have, and have enjoyed, the laserdisc version of this concert, in spite of the O.K. picture quality, and obvious lack of low bass in the audio. There is simply little or nothing below 100 Hz! I grabbed the DVD version in the hope that the quality issues had been remedied . . . nope, it is exactly the same. What a shame. Nevertheless, it remains an entertaining show, with high production values, and some of the best tunes in pop music."
2,Poor picture qualty,"This was a marvellous concert but why, oh why, was this DVD released with such VHS-like picture quality? The sound is no better than my VHS copy either although my Yamaha processor did a great job in an impossible situation. What a waste of potential. I feel ripped off after buying this DVD."
2,Disappointment,"Unfortunately, not recorded for the benefits of a DVD/Home Theater. You can't feel the bass in the pit of your stomach, or feel the vibrations surround you. And this concert has such GREAT potential! It sounds like an average CD."
1,Doesn't work in my DVD player either!,"It's a great DVD, but it won't play in my player. I'm not the only one to write this either.It ""skips"" every 2 minutes making a very noticable jerk in the audio and video. It blanks the audio for about 2 seconds.I'm going to have to return this.. which I'm very sad about as it's an amazing concert."
5,Do I have the same DVD?,"Lets keep a couple of things in mind here, people! First of all this was recorded in 1987, in Africa, in that time period BEFORE digital cameras. And secondly, digital audio (DAT and PCM) was still a maturing medium (still is as far as I'm concerned). The point of the concert was to go there and make a statement and entertain those people, not to put out a hi-fi, hi-res DVD 13 or 14 years later. I have a Sony Trinitron TV and a Sony DVD player, and I think it looks and sounds great, despite those afore-mentioned physical limitations. And what is reviewer #1 talking about? I don't have ANY interviews on my copy. I don't think he/she is reviewing the same thing we are. I have exactly what the description says- a live concert. The performance is fantastic. The sound is great, and the video quality is pretty darn good. If you like the Graceland CD, you will love this concert."
5,Timeless,"This video showcases the timeless music of Paul Simons GRACELAND album. Paul Simon and his unbelievable African cohorts manage to combine intricate African rhythm with pop music and seemingly bridge the gap between two cultures.Lady Smith Black Mombazo are especailly moving and Hugh Masekela singing FREE NELSON MANDELA is unforgettable. The lyrics are Simon at his best.The emotions of the African musicians, exiled from their homeland as a result of Apartheid charge the air and the concert must surely be remebered as a musical milestone.""Five Stars are not enough"" here here..."
1,Poor Quality Transfer,"This is one of my all time favorite CD's, but the DVD should be taken off the shelf. The recording quality is so bad it's almost as if this was taken from a mono VHS recorded over the air. There is no fidelity whatsoever - I'm watching the bass solo in the first number and not hearing any of it. The picture quality is passable but nowhere near what you expect on a DVD. Save your money. Amazon, save your good name and pull this one off the shelf."
5,Paul Simon's African concert,"Although more than a decade old, I adore this concert. The music is fantastic. Seeing and hearing Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba is an extra.Great music."
4,Paul Simon: Graceland - The African Concert,"Paul Simon: Graceland - The African ConcertDidn't have the background of the performance, just the performance.But what a performance!!Television has had the background recently which we are also enjoying.A great moment in history of music and people!"
1,Very weak,I found the concert(DVD) was very poor in regards to sound and video quality. Show has a tendency to drag. DVD's with exceptional sound and video are VH1 Divas Live and Yani(Live at the Acropolis). If you can't deliver quality sound and video why buy in DVD format
1,"A Very, VERY Shoddy Klimt Book","Despite an interesting introductory essay by Christian Brandstaetter, there is practically no reason to get this book. The reproductions are murky, the colour balance is yellowish and the images themselves are cropped badly; Klimt's paintings in particular are mangled by bad cropping and lousy colour reproduction throughout the book. Virtually all the images in this book have been seen over and over - and in much better shape. Even as an exploitation of the Klimt boom, this book is a mess. The book is titled ""Klimt and Fashion"" yet the cover is a work by Egon Schiele - from there, it's all downhill. Oh, and the book is small and skimpy, so not only are the pictures scuzzy, there aren't even many of them."
5,A Must for the Labrador Retriever owner,"This is one of the best books I have read about the labrador retriever. From start to finish this book is a good reference for the total labrador retriever experience. If you have a lab or or thinking about getting a lab, this is an excellent reference."
4,Collecting Kaczmarek,"I seem to go through certain ""Movie Theme"" composers every so often. Right now I am collecting Kaczmarek. It started with the CD ""Hachi"" where the haunting piano work came close to Lesley Barber's ""Mansfield Park"". Next came ""Get Low"" where the music became more multi facet in style & interest. At last after reading the praiseworthy reviews on ""Washington Square"" I had to buy it. This 3rd CD is more classical orientated with opera arias & child choir inter-seeded. Though it does have good music it lacks the charm of ""Hachi"" & the multi styles of ""Get Low"". The Classical music seems to be rather in the ""minimalist"" style which at times does not fit the time period of ""Washington Square"". The song ""Tu Chiami Una Vita"" almost comes close in a section to a Phillip Glass vowel ""Einstein On The Beach"" which is at least a 100 years off from the time period of the story. A good buy if you can find it but not the best of Kaczmarek."
5,Breathtaking soundtrack !,One of the most beautiful soundtracks ever to have written! a must for your libray and a great addition to one's life !
3,NO RISE OR FALL,"Some real cool stuff here. Nothing you wouldn't expect from the brothers. After the last 2 releases you can respect their not pumping out crowd pleasers. Get it, but don't expect anthems or doomsday."
3,3.5 Stars,"Bottomline: Excellent song writing and musicianship with lyrics that get annoying after awhile.Angela's vocals don't show that much range in this CD and she's lacking a distinctive snarl, however so do a lot of other metal bands. She's good, but I think has potential to be a lot better in the future. With that being said most of the songs on this album are not very experimental and it seems to be the same stuff that Arch Enemy has been creating since day one. However, there are plenty of inter changing riffs with melodic heights and solos.All in all, a good CD from a talented band that has so much more potential than what they display on this CD. That is my opinion."
3,Subpar for AE standards,"Compared to Stigmata, wages of sin, anthems of rebellion, and Doomsday machine, this current album doesnt measure up to its predecessors. AE have never been known as the fastest, hardest, or most musical thrash scandanavian band, however they did have a formula of creative catchy musical notes with melodic choruses complimented by angela's powerfull timely vocals. This album lacks those elements. Despite having tight riffs and displaying good musicianship throughout every song here, AE lacks the catchy formula per song they had in their previous albums. This album just lacks good song writing."
4,A step forward,"They're not the catchiest metal band around, but Sweeden's Arch Enemy are heavy, fast, and raw as hell. And let's not forget that their vocalist Angela Gossow has possibly the meanest growl in today's metal scene. Their latest album is faster, heavier, and at the same time, more melodic, with the introduction of keyboards, which are a nice touch to an already brutally good band. It might not match up to ""Anthems of Rebellion,"" but it's darn close."
4,"Not Much Progress, Not A Retreat","I don't see this as a big change - what comeback? They have some good and bad tracks each album. I consider their guitar solos a weak spot; they could be better. Angela's voice is still solid, considering the abuse. They're still more musical than most metal bands today. Can you tell if Mortician has written a bad track? Didn't think so. With Arch Enemy, at least you can form an opinion. The first strong track here is number three, to me. Go ahead and buy it."
5,Perfect cd in every way!,This cd is amazing! I am so impressed how much Arch Enemy has improved over the years. This cd is better than Doomsday Machine and ranks with Wages of Sin. Buy it!
5,JERRY LEE RULES!!,I love the music of Jerry Lee and was very pleased to add this CD to my collection. This is a really good selection of his music and the price was more than reasonable on Amazon.
4,An attractive volume,"Here we have again a nice old book via the local inter-library loan system. This copy is a large-ish but not thick volume, bound in blue cloth. It has a nice ""old"" feeling in hand.The silver marks are presented with a generous amount of white space, with very brief remarks. It is an attractive presentation but perhaps more limited than some of the other resources. Still it is a very pleasant book, and a limited edition with a few notes and illustrations, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter."
1,NYC,"The quality was very disappointing, I don't purchase street bootleg DVD's because their quality is poor and this, ""Get Christy Love"" was just as bad. I give it 1 star because I love Theresa Graves."
5,A moving finale to the Foundation series,"This book is certainly not the best of Asimov's illustrious career, but its story neatly and elegantly concludes his hallmark Foundation series. In the previous books, (almost all of which take place after this one) Hari Seldon is portrayed as a legend and hero, but Forward the Foundation makes him human, as he takes in all the events around him in an attempt to save the galaxy from thousands of years of barbarism.The entries from the ""Encyclopedia Galactica"" add a very sobering touch, as they tell the readers that Seldon's dreams were fulfilled (though not in the way he expected), and the galaxy was saved. In the same way, we can expect that Isaac Asimov's brilliance will be remembered forever, even as the Spacers take to the stars, and Earth's inhabitants return to the womb of their world"
4,the pre that comes at the end,Important background for the series. Like the Hobbit to Lord of the Ring. Rounds out what really makes sense to the Foundation's founder.
4,Good Start to the Foundation Series,"If you like Asimov, this is another of his better books. It helps tie together from the iRobot series to the Foundation."
5,Excellent book,"The foundation series is one of Science Fiction's best works. This was the last book Issac Asimov wrote in thise series, and in my opinion very best of these books. It tells part of the life of Hari Seldon, the father of phycohistory. I would recommend reading the other foundation novels first, to really appriciate this book."
3,Only for the faithful,"As I recall, Asimov died while still working on this book. It shows. The book has a rushed feel. There is a lot of interesting stuff here, but it is not explored with Asimov's usual brilliance. The characters are also poorly drawn, especially that of Dors Venabili. That may actually be Asimov's fault as he was never very good at writing women characters -- certainly not in the same class as, say, Robert Heinlein. It's telling that several years after I read the entire series, I can clearly remember the plots of most of the books vividly, but had to thumb through Forward again to remind myself of what happened.If you're a huge Foundation fan (like me), it's probably worth buying and reading, just to complete your journey through the Foundation series. It's not a BAD book, afterall. But for those of you new to Asimov in general and the Foundation series in particular, this is the wrong place to start."
3,"While being boring at times, it is a good asimov book!","After reading the orignal trilogy, I had to continue to his later books(i.e. Foundation's edge and Foundation and Earth and also the preqels.) I found them to be extremly dissapointing. They lack the ""time jumps"" of the first three. I read them anyway. Finaly I read Forward the Foundation, finally he returns to his orignal format! I soon found parts of it very depressing. (i.e. the end) Only hard-core fans like myself would enjoy this very well written book."
2,only for hardcore fans,"I could barely get through this, even on a remote beach w/ limited reading available. Talk about formulaic! And the sexual stereotyping really gets old."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The last of Asimov's Foundation books, and the second of his Seldon prequels.Forward the Foundation : Eto Demerzel - Isaac AsimovForward the Foundation : Cleon I - Isaac AsimovForward the Foundation : Dors Venabili - Isaac AsimovForward the Foundation : Wanda Seldon - Isaac AsimovForward the Foundation : Epilogue - Isaac AsimovSeldon is robot replacement.3.5 out of 5Removing the boss.3 out of 5My wife's a dead robot killer.3.5 out of 5Another one bites the dust, lucky I have a useful granddaughter.3 out of 5Looking back.3 out of 5"
2,Gosh I love the concept but a total lack of action forced me to stop reading,"I usually go more into depth with my reviews. However, I did not even find the motivation to finish.I love the ideas and concepts of this book, however, I just was not compelled to finish. I like to be compelled when I read. This just didn't do it for me."
5,A surprisingly good and moving book.,"Upon finishing the other six Foundation novels, I finally picked up ""Forward the Foundation"". I was amazed by the humanity of the book--it is rarely seen in any other Asimov piece. I enjoyed all of them, but the life of Hari Seldon is more intruiging to me than the deified hologram of Hari Seldon seen in later books. It is difficult to write a ""non-spoiler"" review of this book, but the characters are delightful and the galaxy is real. For anyone with an interest in these stories, Forward the Foundation is one that should most assuredly not be missed. Asimov's (and possibly ours) future universe comes to life in a whole new light"
5,Extraordinary,"Asimov, in his final book of the classic foundation trilogy,never fails to provide though-provoking reading. In this novel,wea learn of the late life in the infamous Hari Seldon and thepeople he knew best. The book details his most intimiate times withhis closest friends and damily members.Forward Foundation is written in a different style than the other books:it covers many more years, from Seldon's fourties to his death.Forward foundation is the kind of novel that makes one think aboutall the thing important to him or herself.We learn about the Second Foundation, the reasoning behind itand how it was founded. Faces from previous novels appear in this one as well.The robots from Foundation and Earth and Robots and empire are present.All in all, a wonderful read and the crowning achievment of Asimov's work."
5,"psychohistory,robots and all the rest ...",its a great wonderfull book! this book and the others from the foundation series together build the great epus of psychohistory.in the book is the final part of seledon's and how he and all the humans around his life build in parts the great psichohistory! the statistic science of the mathematic way to see and create the future!
4,Isaac Asimov in his final triumph!,"As the Galactic Empire continues to crack and crumble around an aging Hari Seldon, who races to finish Psychohistory in time to save humanity, you feel that Asimov was describing his own life partly as he felt himself fading away. The sadness of it is real and pure. Three cheers for Asimov!"
5,The kids love it!,"We bought this as a last minute Christmas gift for our eight-year old son who was caught up in the Transformers fad, but also loved Star Wars. It turned out to be the surprise hit of the holiday! As robots, the Han Solo and Chewbacca transformers are true to the ""Transformer"" spirit -- well made, poseable, accessory weapons, all that stuff. But the best thing is how well they come together as the Millennium Falcon. It is literally an amazing transformation, and the Millennium Falcon is very true to the movie version. The Star Wars sounds are great too. The toy is highly recommended!"
4,Good investment...,- LED triangle has 5 different light patterns.- Easy to read directions for the *RTM challenged people- Compact and lightweight - easy to store and carry- Charges in 8 hours.- For Battery Boost feature - Turn unit on to 'Outlet' and plug the 12V plug into your car for 20 minutes BEFORE trying to start.- Pouch with hand strap for storageAll in all - this is a nice little unit to have on hand and I particularly like the compact size and light weight.4/5 stars because: Only 2 issues I can see is the flashlight is not LED (as the triangle lights are) and the 12V plug (used to charge the unit and as a car battery charger) is external to the unit. It would have been nice if there were some way to store it inside the unit. As it is I would recommend keeping the twist tie that it comes with tho avoid getting the cord tangled.I paid $16.16 for this product and think I most definitely received my moneys worth.*RTM - read the manual
1,small,"I need to learn how to read the dimensions. Thought I was getting a 5lb bag of sand to refill the kids sandbox, thought the price a bit steep for that, but got a tiny little bag of sand that fits in the palm of my hand. Only myself to blame for not reading directions. wouldnt spend the money for something so small."
5,"Excellent replacement, Good price","My pool filter system uses the Unicel 150 cartridge. This filter is not name brand ""Unicel"", but it works just as good for a better price."
5,THE book if you are a kernel/threading developer.,"I work on MP SVR4 kernels and this book is where I got most of my basics on MP from. I didn't understand the contents all at once - especially the initial intro to memory models in chapter 8, but after reading the SPARC specs (V8 & V9) and chapter 13, I can see how all this is relevant.If you are porting a unix or any OS for that matter to todays architectures, this book should help clear up what issues you would encounter and how best to solve them. For example the memory models and consistency guarantees of the source architecture and how they compare to the destination.And ofcourse its a great aid to understanding any contemporary OS' kernel code.veliath"
4,Finally an Album That Does Justice to Fabric's Fabriclive Nights,"If you're ever in London, and want a great night out, head to Fabric. Fridays are their Fabriclive nights and it's this environment that the Fabriclive series attempts to capture. There is no substitutue to actually being there, but this album by Adam Freeland is pretty damn close!The other Fabriclive albums have been pretty disappointing for me. Sounding more like amature talent night at some hick club or bar. Not this one. An eclectic set of urban, electro, and hip-hop tracks mixed on a background of Freeland's preferred breakbeat rhythms. Nicely done.4/5 stars."
5,Excellent Guide,"Excellent guide for hiking in the Superstition Mountains Wilderness. The book nicely lays out trail information including topographic maps, length, and difficulty."
2,lame,"Done in the style of Forensic Files and other similar docu-drams ""based on true stories"", this show is dreadful. If they had edited out the frequent repeating scenes (like they often do in these made-for-TV shows to keep your interest) the stories might have been better, but probably would have been able to be show in 5-10 minutes. I hate when they do this on TV, but it is really annoying when they do it in a video you buy.The Special effects are also rather dreadful - dressing up a guy in a ghost/ghoul/demon costume you could pick up at any Halloween store, was stupid and lazy. I didn't know if I was suppose to be suspensfully fearful or splitting my side in laughter of the overly cheezey effects. The dialog & acting was generally poor, althought a few of actors seem to at least have had some acting experience.Overall, I wouldn't waste money on this unless you can get real cheap and have nothing better to do with your life for an hour or 2. Stupid me - I bought the Blu Ray version."
5,A Haunting,This dvd is about driffent hunting in the U.S. All that is show in thisdvd is supose to be real. If you lilllllke hunted house storts Your like this.
4,Well researched documentation of retailing change in L.A,The changes in retailing which have taken place in L.A. which are examined in this book have occured throughout the United States and are taking place throughout the world right noe. The population shift to the suburbs and shopping in regional malls.This has caused the value of retail space to decline in many area of America.
3,"So, so......","This was an easy book to read and had some humerous parts in it. I think the thing that bothered me the most about this book was the obsession the heroine had with not having a college degree and she was always so down on herself that it got old after a while.This was my first Karen Kendall book and might not be my last but I think I'd rather read Patti Berg, Susan Andersen or Julie Ortolon."
2,Really not worth it!,"The premise of the book is interesting but I think the story was not developed well. The Hero is corny and sappy, actually kind of a sissy. The heroine is cheap and an IDIOT that has serious self esteem issues. There was no chemistry between the main characters. I'm going to buy ""Something about Cecily"" (?) I hear that one is very good, but this one was rather disappointing :( nt."
4,Fun Heartwarming Read.,"Lavander Hart is from Kansas, she is in New York to be near her little brother, Adam. Adam has won a scholarship to one of the prestigeous private schools because of his intelligence. She is desperately looking for a job. Not having a college degree, she is not having much luck. Finally she finds a job as a dog sitter to a wealthy, successful architect.Nicolas Wright is a workaholic, who has no time for love, romance or stopping to smell the flowers, much less the pooch his great aunt just left him. Vinnie is an answer to his ad. She is also an answer to his life, if he can just slow down enough to see her.That is just what happens, suddenly somehow, a confirmed cynic, finds his home invaded with a delightful woman, a homesick boy, and a wonderful dog who has an outfit for every occasion. Let the fun begin."
4,A gem in its own special way,"You will want to approach this television series with an open mind, otherwise the sometimes wooden acting and the cheap sets will put you off, and you will be tempted to give a lower rating that it deserves. The story is wonderfully imaginative and totally absorbing: A City yuppie is dragged down into London Below; an underworld where all our memories and nightmares of London are real, have a life of their own, and are very, very dangerous. Thinly disguised, it is about homeless people and social outcasts. I hope that all the allusions to the London Underground won't be lost on an international audience."
1,Give it a miss,"I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan, so it pains me to say it, but this film is one of the worst I've seen in recent history. The production values are absolutely nil, the acting isn't there at all, and there's just absolutely nothing here worth watching. I turned it off before I even got to London Below; the whole thing was simply unwatchable, and even Gaiman's commentary wasn't terribly interesting. Definitely give it a miss and pick up the book instead; Gaiman definitely improved upon his story when he wrote it up as a novel."
4,Once it sucks you in...,"After being a huge fan of Neil Gaiman's work in comics, I bought the VHS release of Neverwhere when it first came out... and to tell you the truth I got a bit disappointed at first. The production is typical of the BBC of those times.. almost like a theater production... but on television. The sets, costumes, acting and camerawork all feel pretty cheap.. but I'm not saying that in a negative way.. it does have it's charms, but at the same time it works a bit repelling for the story and does feel really strange, especially for a Gaiman fan, because it's like seeing a Gaiman comic on-stage-on-screen.. But this is where I get to my point: it IS a Neil Gaiman script and a very good one at that. And like the best of his comics it does suck you in and is very enjoyable... even though the cheap production does make it a bit more difficult than from what you've come to expect from his comics..."
4,Enjoy Dr. Who? You'll enjoy NEIL GAIMAN'S NEVERWHERE.,"The production quality of NEIL GAIMAN'S NEVERWHERE on the BBC is easily on par with any Dr. Who episode. So I would venture to say that if you enjoy DR. WHO, you'll probably enjoy Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere. The acting is solid and the writing is (of course) excellent.I saw the DVD before I read the book and I was a little disappointed in the book. Having been written by popular demand after the BBC series, it is almost an exact scene by scene duplication of the show offering little revelatory information."
3,"The original version, but not the best","I realize that the story of Neverwhere was originally intended as a film/mini-series. However, my first introduction to the story was in the audiobook format, and I must say it is far superior to this DVD. A low budget production, I was really turned off by the amateur-ish look. If you are not familiar with the story, watch the DVD first. If you have read the book, this might not be worth watching, but listen to the audio book. It is brilliant!"
4,Neverwhere is a great story...,"As a Gaiman fan I had to get this... his writing is excellent in any medium he tries. The only bad critissism about it is the overall look, visually speaking. The acting is decent-good, the writing is interesting. If you love good fantasy writing, this is worth your time."
2,An Unfortunate Adaptation,"I am a big Gaiman fan: I have thoroughly enjoyed his graphic and text novels, and love ""Good Omens"", his collaboration with Terry Pratchett.That said, this miniseries is... regrettable. It's rather low budget and cheesy, with FX that are poor, but not quite poor enough to have a ""Dr Who"" kind of campy charm. The acting is slightly sub-par at best, and the plot progression is somewhat jerky.I do think Neverwhere could be made into an excellent screen feature with the right producer and sufficient money, but this effort just didn't quite make it."
2,Nevermind Neverwhere,It's bad theatre on video tape. Neither the production value nor acting stand up to daytime soap-operas. A disappointment.
1,yuck! yuck! yuck!,"i rented this with an 'oh wow' - the bbc + neil gaiman- hooray!boy was i wrong! it was annoying, ill-produced, low-budget in the worst way (low budget can turn out all kinds of good stuff, this was just bad costuming and stupid special efx).i watched most of the wretched thing- until i fell asleep about twenty minutes before the end- even with all of the time i invested- i returned it without bothering to view those last moments.if you're smart you'll stay away and read a sandman comic instead!"
1,Total dissapointment!,"If ever there was a book that deserved to be made into a big budget movie this was it. Unfortunately it looks like it was rushed to production with the goal of making a quick buck. This production is a text book case on how to ruin a good story with cheasy effects, poor direction, and horrible acting. It is also the poster child for ruined expectations. The director, producers, and to a lesser extent writers either had a very bad day or have fallen into the commonly held misconception that scifi or fantasy fans will watch anything regardless of quality. My reconmendation Neverwhere? Nevermore!"
4,"Again, the BBC Production Came First","Like many others, I had read Neverwhere and other Neil Gaiman Books before I discovered there was a BBC mini-series. I looked it up on Wikipedia, IMDB and Amazon and learned some of the history of the series, which included the fact that the book was based on the mini-series, not the other way around. It's probable that the book is as good as it is because they shot the script on video first (with what little funding they could get - no book to show off yet) and had the opportunity to ""see"" the vision first. So I watched the mini-series with somewhat realistic expectations, and had a lot of fun doing so. I encourage everyone, whether you have read the book or not, to learn about Neil Gaiman and how the series came about before watching it. And hopefully the upcoming movie will do both the original series, and the book, justice."
3,Enjoyable just by Neverwhere's fans,"Even though this miniseries comes with many flaws - that is, poors sfx, ordinary recitation, handmade sceneries and so on - I guess it may be easily enjoyed by the fans of the original book.In Neverwhere they'll find just the same atmoshpere that tasted so good in the novel; they'll recognize Richard Mayhew as a plain ordinary englishman; even Croup and Vandemar are decently rendered.Don't expect bunnies out of the hat, but feel free to consider buying this series if you've already read (and loved) the book: you'll be rewarded with 3 hours of pure entertainment. Some smile will rise on your lips as you'll see some naive characterization, but you can make it through and go on 'til the end.But if you are expecting for a modern mass-market kolossal production just like Raimi's Spiderman, look anywhere else and leave this couple of dvd on the shelves."
2,"Too bad, so sad",They took a really potentially great concept and did a half-ass job on it. Especially could have left out all that goofy stop-motion stuff.
4,HD1390,Said it would fit my Fat Boy. It didn't so I returned it and they sent me one that did. Same Amazon service.
3,this could be better,this could be a lot better than it is now. i think this needs more power to its baby engine.
2,Is this a joke?,"When I read 2.25 HP being described as ""powerful,"" I thought this must be some kind of sick joke. I use chainsaws all the time with my carcasses, and 16"" ain't nothing. First of all, let's get one thing straight, o.k.? Electric chainsaws have their limitations. That being said, I could still use it for chopping down trees and roundin up firewood. However, as for my, shall we say, clandestine operations, I have found this Milwaukee variety of chainsaw to be less than cutting edge, pardon the pun."
3,More real than any fake Hollywood production,"I have been a Marcinko fan for a little over 2 years now and was not disappointed with this video. It is always great to see real warriors in action. I'll agree that this video was too short and did not show enough of Red Cell in action. I don't know if that is because of the availability of the real tapes or not but you still come away with a pretty good idea of what was happening with the security of these bases. The quality of the video could have been better in a perfect world but this is not COPS. This was sneaking and peaking. In the heat of battle it's a little harder to concentrate on the camera angle. You couldn't exactly yell ""Cut"" and reshoot a scene. You do get to see and hear Marcinko for a good part of the video. Also Steve Hartman (a.k.a. Stevie Wonder). It shows how much we need a team like Red Cell in the future. But let them do what they are trained to do."
2,Not worth the money...,"An avid Marcinco fan, I was very disappointed with this video. Not only was it short, but there weren't enough op's to support the Red Cell's ""real-life"" missions. I just felt Dick Marcinco could have done a better job! :("
2,The Templar Continuum,Rarely do I begrudge the money spent on a book but this attempt at a new theory for the origins of the Templars is sorely lacking in content. Without any footnotes and no index or bibliography I found trying to accept the authors' theories was a hard pill to swallow. This book deserves only two stars for the interesting ideas that are proposed - certainly not for the amateurish way in which they are presented. The many typo errors only add to the uncomfortable feeling that this entire effort was concocted in someone's garage and thrown out to the public at an outrageously high price.
3,Tom Waits meets the Gun Club?,"Kid Congo Powers and Sally Norvell got together and made a great drinking record. Stories like Tom Waits, swampy R&B sensibilities of Jeffrey Lee Pearce, and boy-girl harmonies straight out of the X canon yield a strong set of songs that bear repeat listening well. Perfect for a late-night staring out a window and regretting the past."
2,mediocre music for bad people,"There's nothing horrible about this album, but it's not particularly remarkable, either. The songwriting isn't very sharp, and the lyrics come off as cheesy high school imitations of sleazy songs written by the likes of Nick Cave, Firewater, The Cramps, etc. Seems it's best to leave such debauched tales to the true masters..."
5,Movie,I love this series of santa clause movies and have such fun watching them over and over again. To laugh and a good time is priceless.
2,Very Lacking,"First of all, AFI only reconizes English-speaking movies. Classics like ""The Grand Illusion"", ""The Seven Samurai"" or ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" are not on this list, even though they are far more superior to movies like ""Forrest Gump"", ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Also, some movies were left off this list that I couldn't understand why. Movies such as ""The Exorcist"", ""Rain Man"", ""Touch Of Evil"" and ""The Lost Weekend"". Still, there are a few movies on the list that truly deserved to be there. I'm not talking about the usual fair such as ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". These movies truly do deserve to be on this list, but movies I wouldn't expect like ""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""Fargo"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". I hope the AFI puts out another list soon, only with foreign-language pictures and also they take a good long look at what they're selecting."
4,All Movies are now available from AFI -- for a price,"AFI is now offering all 100 of the movies in VHS format in matching cases for $2500 plus shipping, etc. The extra money (they say $1500 may be tax deductible)goes to AFI for film restoration, etc, but if you don't have the extra $$ stick with Amazon. You can get many of them in DVD format for less than the $25 each AFI is charging."
2,A disgrace...,"A few years ago, the AFI (American Film Institute) paid a tribute to America's 100 ""greatest"" films. Well, I have some strong opinions about the 100 movies chosen. First off, where's The Exorcist? It's only the greatest horror movie ever made, and also one of the most influencial films of all time, it's almost laughable it didn't make the list. I personally consider The Exorcist to be the greatest movie ever made, period. What is Forrest Gump and Fargo doing on this list? Okay, I can see Fargo, maybe, but Forrest Gump? Please, it's only on the list becuase of it's many ""technical acheivements."" To make this short, I disagree with almost the entire list of films chosen, and if you like boring, ancient, black & white movies...well, this is for you."
3,SOME WERE LEFT OUT,"The list was a good one, but there were some movies I couldn't understand not being on the list. The Exorcist, Braveheart, Rain Man, The Empire Strikes Back, Deliverance and Dirty Harry should have made this list."
2,Not even good television,"Night of a Thousand Stars 2. Here'an idea. Go to AFI's Web site, AFI.com, check out the top 100 list and buy one you've never seen. Now that's worth celebrating."
4,A good sampler of the top 100 films up to 1996,"This is an excellent sampler of the top 100 films up to 1996. I've collected all of the AFI movies that I could buy (96 out of 100), and I have watched two-thirds of them. This sampler allowed me to remember the movies I've seen, and to look forward to the remaining movies. I recommend this DVD, and I would like to see the AFI to put a similar edition in a coffee table book."
4,Perhaps the Controversy Makes This More Fun,"While I agree with many of the reviews below (both good and bad), I believe AFI has put together a good starting place for discussion about our cinema past.I don't necessarily agree with some of the films listed. I don't think that Platoon is the best Vietnam movie, although it's a great movie. I think that Full Metal Jacket is better. Does Unforgiven belong on the list? I don't think so, but the discussion is the part of the fun.I just think that AFI has given us the means to discuss and reflect upon what a great movie is. And, let's be honest, are there only 100 great ones? I doubt that the American Film institute would ever acknowledge that!"
3,Uri Pilichowski,"Uri PilichowskiUri Pilichowski says that in order to be a great speaker one has to learn from other masters, and there is no better way, than becoming familiar with other greats' works.Uri Pilichowski"
4,DIFFERENT THAN I EXPECTED,THOUGHT THIS WOULD JUST BE SOMETHING FLUFFY TO READ OVER A WEEKEND BUT IT SHOWED SOME REAL DEPTH & CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. I HAVE READ SEVERAL OF DIANA'S BOOKS AND FIND THEM TO BE VERY GOOD.
3,Too Close to the Sun,"Easy read good holiday book read, a love story....Enjoyable but end predictable, some information on the art of wine making for anyone who likes a glass of red or white"
1,Painfully boring,"An enormously boring singer ccan't save brilliant songwriting. So often is the case of Bonoff's career whose second album is a tad bit more fatigued than her first. Fans of her songwriting certainly will have a hard time warming up to Bonoff's vocals on this album. From the visionless ""Trouble Again"" to the clunky ""Never Stop Her Heart"" this album never picks up. Not recommended to anyone but die-hard fans."
3,FUN or NOT ???,"I found this game interesting. You get to destroy targets such as tanks, ant hills, and other things. I think the most challenging levels are: the back yard and finel level. the only problems I found were: tow player mode, you see the aircraft from above, you only see the enemy when your close or on your radar. I only suggest this game if you dont care about the way you see your aircraft."
4,Army Men Air Combat,"I love this game! When I first saw it in a video store I did not ask to rent it because I did not know it was a helicopter game. I thought the picture on the box meant it simulated being an infantryman(a foot soldier). Ecxept for after my mom got it for me for christmas. When I read the information about the game on the back of the box,it sounded ecxciting! It has been my favorite game ever since."
5,beauty and the beast,"A very interesting and though-provoking collection of essays. It covers myth, art, drama, philosophy as well as legal discourse. Although no collection of this type could ever hope to be the definitive guide to such a wide-ranging topic this book provides an excellent starting point with, on the whole well-researched and insightful articles. I found the notes and bibliographies most useful."
3,A quarter of them are good.,"A collection of any type of writing is always a risking purchase. It is unlikely that all the essays will be of the same quality or hold the same interest for the reader. However, a scholarly collection should have a high standard to begin with and thus I was disappointed by ""Rape in Antiquity"". Out of 12 articles, I can only strongly recommend three by Rosanna Omitowoju, Daniel Ogdenm, and Karen F. Pierce. All the others lack sufficient evidence to prove their theses, do not write well-enough to explain their opinions, or seem to be reading sources that are quite different from what I've read. Note that two of the twelve essays are really about the medieval world, not antiquity, and that two of the articles are about Roman ideas leaving the bulk, eight, concerning Greece, especially Athens in the classical period."
1,Do not buy - very bad product and very bad service,"These hats are awful, which matches their customer service.I returned the items I bought, and they refuse to process the refund."
2,Poor Value for Money,"As with MSB Whales and Dophins, this is not a full-fledged Magic School Bus CD, but is just an activity center. The Magic School Bus CDs fall into two categories: full-fledged exploration programs and activity centers. The full-fledged programs are excellent and represent good value for money. Three of my children (ages 7, 5 and 3) spends hours exploring with MSB Oceans, Animals, Solar System, and Dinosaurs. They are great. On the other hand, he is quickly bored with the Activity Centers, such as Whales and Dolphins, Flight, and Mars. They simply present one screen with things to click on.Since a full-fledged MSB CD has half-a-dozen or more places to explore, the activity centers represent less than 1/6th the value of a full-fledged MSB CD. Don't buy them unless you get them for less than 1/6th the price of the full-fledged CDs."
1,"only 20 in a pack of ""25""","The tags are great, but I felt ripped off only getting 20 in the pack that was marked and sold as 25."
5,Inspiring,"As I read ""A Mind to Work"" to prepare to write my resume, I was drawn by Ms. Harrison into an unexpected self-evaluation of my life both realistically and spiritually that I was more motivated to write my last will and testament."
3,Mistakes with Articles!,"I'm an adult, learning German and I felt a fun book like this with pictures to help me remember the nouns would be a lot easier to learn from than just plain text to read.It is that, it's good to see the picture and associate that along with the English meaning. The problem is on a few occassions (about 3) the articles were wrong. The book said the noun was a 'der' when it was a 'die' and so forth. This was huge to me because when learning German nouns, you must know the right article in order to use them in sentences correctly."
5,Useful for teachers,"I bought this on a whim for my son-in-law, who is a Middle School German teacher. He opened it on Christmas day and absolutely loved it. He said it will come in very handy for his lessons at school."
2,Its heavy and has handles...,"But its also rock hard. If I tossed this up and missed it, I think it would crack my skull or worse. I got it 2 weeks ago and it was a little cold out, so I thought maybe thats why it was so hard. But its still that way 2 weeks later after being inside where its been warm. I think maybe its over inflated but I havent figured out yet how to let some air out, if thats the problem. I've used an 8lb ball from a different manufacturer and it bounces 3 feet or more when it hits the ground. The 10lb one lands with a dull thud and has absolutely no bounce. Have been to scared to use it."
3,CUT AND EDITED DVD W/MISSING SCENES? ? WHAT GIVES?,"Remembering what a great flick this was,I was about to buy this DVD,then saw the review that noted that several key scenes have been taken outto make it more family-oriented? This stinks!I recently also purchased a DVD of BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVESfrom AMAZON and returned it after finding a key scene had been cutfrom the first 1/2 hour. What is the point of selling these DVDs if wecan't get the original unedited uncut version???As a minimum, AMAZON should note in BIG LETTERS in each ad ifthis is a CUT AND EDITED VERSION. That way, mnay of us will know not tobuy it."
3,one of my favorite mcqueen's performance,i just received the dvd and i'm really disapointed...again warner bros put this movie in one channel audio...the previews are louder than the film...warner bros has done this numerous times...and when ordering it will not list the audio and this clues me in...so i'm asking all to let warner know about this and maybe even the mcqueen family...there is no reason to put one channel audio out without the buyer knowing it. i'm giving it 3 stars only for this reason..a great film ruined by audio.
3,Left out scenes,"Foremost I don't understand how this arrived with gouges in the front of the case. This arrived a few weeks ago and the gouges were not apperant until I opened the shrink wrap. It is to late to leave package feedback.The scene where Tom and the school teacher in the tank was omitted, which was a vital part of the story. I've found out that I can't bear to watch the movie after Tom is arrested and has to look at the hills and mountains through the bars.I'm still pissed about the gouges! Anyone else have the problem with the packagemethods? It's the same problem with Pale Rider."
4,Tom Horn,As good as Nevada Smith. Unable to obtain many films in New Zealand. Your prices are very competitive to ours only your postage is dearer which is understanderable but your service is great.
4,Still a favorite and still a classic,I hadn't seen this flick in more years than I care to remember. It still gave me that old western thrill and re-captured me. Steve was really cool yet played a realistic human being. He died like a man with his boots on.
5,Great Classic Western,24 Oct 09 Saturday; The old western will never go out of style. They only get better with time!!!!! This is one of Steves best!!!!! We cannot stop progress or change!!! Thank you Amazon.dvd for excellent customer service. I do not buy from Blockbuster any more. You @ Amazon.dvd or books have the lowest prices!!!!!!! Everyone is trying to save afew $$$$$$$$$$$. But these old western movies still keep their value!!!!!!!!! Thank you again Amazon.dvd. Best/Wishes Charles in So. California.....
3,A clumsily directed Steve McQueen Western...,"I was a bit underwhelmed by this film.A frail McQueen plays the ""legendary"" Tom Horn, as a near-mythical heroic figure who lands in a small Western town. He is asked to clear up some trouble, honorably does so, and in the process is set up to take the fall for the townsfolk.McQueen's performance is fine...he's clearly ill so you instinctively give him a bit of leeway.The direction, however, is sloppy. It's unimaginative and pokey. Beautiful vistas yes, but the flashbacks are clumsy, many of the minor supporting actors are flat-out awful and the two-act structure makes for an awkward ending.Farnsworth, however, is perfect. Linda Evans has some absolutely horrible lines, but is supposed to look dreamy, and does.Fans of McQueen need to see this, but will be somewhat heartbroken while watching it.Seeing this after seeing ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Bullitt"" and ""The Getaway"" is a bit of a letdown, but I'm glad I took the time to see it..."
3,"Great movie, however..................","I loved this movie when it was released in the early eighties that I thought when I purchased this dvd, that is was going to be the same original, uncut movie I watched for the first time; not so! Don't get me wrong, I love Steve McQueen and have several of his movies on dvd, but Warner video cut out the fight scene at the start of the movie, as well as deleting other parts of the movie to make it more ""family oriented"" for the entire family to watch. That said, the rest of the movie is awesome, along with the beautiful photography which the film was shot in Wyoming. If you never watched this movie before, or don't remember the ""details"" of the movie when it was released, I highly recommend this second to the last movie Steve McQueen did prior to his premature departure from our lives!"
1,Very Slow and boring.,There was no point to the movie and it had a horrible ending..........blah!!The reason why I picked it was because of the actors in it and it had a 4 star rating; however they didn't know what they were talking about.
4,An Overlooked Gem,"Taken on it's own, Steve McQueen's Tom Horn stands as a fine portrayal of the western frontier at the turn of the last century.If there are flaws it is in the editing, which seems choppy at times, leaving the viewer to want more of the scene and perhaps in a too sympathetic showing of Horn, who was not as likable human being if history is accurate.But that is quibbling. Mcqueen's penultimate role is one to seen and remembered."
4,Best anthology for the money,Gives insight into ancient thought and religion in the Middle East. Most comprehensive volume I've come across.
5,Action Packed War Movie,"This movie has a great plot, tense situations, and unbelieveable cinamentography (I don't know if I spelled that right). Any way, this is a great war movie that I highly recomend to people who like to watch movies without the possibility of Dozing. Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman do a [great] job in this one of a kind film!"
4,Exciting Action Movie,"Great military movie, lots of action and current topic. Top stars and fast paced plot keep you riveted to the screen!"
3,Burnt Cake,"This movie has the ingrediants with a good star cast ,great special effects an super scrip but fails to deliver at the end of it all.Gene Hackman plays the role(model) he loves to do best an a promising Owens lives upto expectations but.........still a burnt cake."
1,Dire !,"This film just goes to show how pompous and stupid Americans are ! Not just through the highly stereotyped film but due to the completly DIRE direction.The scene in which ""our boy"" arrives at the (first) rendezvous point and radios in, for example, when Hackman looses the radio signal then blares out ""where is he ? I need a location"" (after he was just told he'd reached the rendezvous point) closely followed by a quick radio conversation with no location whatsoever resulting in everyone going to the same place. The only reason you would want to see this film is to make you feel good that the Americans only came into World War 2 at the last minute! Pedictable and Lame (Soundtrack is ok though Fluke and Feeder both English bands ... how patriotic :) )"
3,ehh,i give it three stars not cause of the quality of the product..well its a little bit cause the quality of the product. ha. but mainly because it took FOREVER for it to come in.
3,Behind Ememy Lines,This is a good to very good film. Cast is very good. Visuals are great on Blu-Ray.
5,Heroic Adventure,"This was a great movie, very inspirational to anyone in the navy, army and air force or armed forces of any kind and survives an hostility from foreign countries. I was on the edge of my seat with this movie, lots of action and heroism. I think that this movie is one of the best I have ever seen. Owen Wilson did a fantastic job in this movie and although he streamlines with mostly his character he was great in this action movie and held his own."
3,Excellent Gene Hackman--and I don't like Gene Hackman!,"This was a surprisingly thrilling story about the rescue of an American pilot in the war in Bosnia. The pilot's mission was to take photographs of the, ""Killing fields."". Upon rescue of the pilot, he also manages to rescue the photographs. The Serbs are the bad guys. There is no gray.The movie is loaded with special effects and explosions. Gene Hackman is pretty good in this one, even I have to admit. I liked the actor, Owen Wilson, who played the pilot. He looked and acted very different than most male actors would, especially in a military role. He seemed like an average, regular guy, with a normal personality, which I felt drew a lot of credibility and sympathy from me, to his character.The film was based on a true incident. Some of the technology shown was amazing. I hope for our sake that we really have such capability."
2,exaggerated story,"If you know what really happenned in the war in Bosnia you will laugh at this movie. It is supposedly presenting a true story a la' Hollywood style glorifying our pilot shot down in Bosnia. It is a patriotic movie but at the expense of the Serbs who suffered enough from us without being made into a motley crew of heartless, bloodthirsty savages in another Hollywood happy ending lie.The beginning of the movie is too long to prep you for the whole ordeal. I love Gene Hackman but he looked fake and desperate in this movie. Owen Wilson is fun but not here while he is sliding on his behind shooting at the serbian tanks and heavy machine guns with his side arm getting the best of them. The story as a whole doesn't fall through.Skip it and get a better flick, there are a lot more better choices at the local [store]."
2,Behind Enemy Lines - The Movie,To me this movie has a weak story and is boring. Gene Hackman's talent is wasted. Owen Wilson should be in comic movies only.
2,Not very believable.,"The hero is a reckless fool, and the villians are all incompetent. This movie is somewhat entertaining, but is just not in any kind of reality.When he's being shot at hundreds of times, and goes through a minefield, he wouldn't have made it. It's called shrapnel.Even forgetting about shrapnel, the darn explosions hit him directly half a dozen times and he keeps running.Gene Hackman, and the jet plane scene were the highpoint. You might squeeze 2 1/2 stars out of me because I was atleast entertained. Not a keeper for my collection."
2,Patriotism bordering on Nationalism,"Whenever a movie claims to be based on a true story, BEWARE. This movie is classic US propaganda. America is all alone in the world and can rely on no one but itself. Even when we try to help another country, they hate us. The individual is all, damn the big picture. For every US soldier killed or wounded, about 100 of the enemy have to die. The enemy is just that, the enemy: pure evil, no shade of grey. I do give this movie 2 stars because the action is non-stop and it isn't a boring movie to watch. Also, it's one of those movies that is so bad it is almost good. If only the realities of the ""ethnic cleansing"" in Bosnia weren't so tragic."
3,OVERPRICED ?,"I'm really excited that FOX is finally releasing some of it's catalog titles on Blu-Ray. But these titles are exactly that catalog titles, that are priced higher than most studios day and date releases. The picture and sound quality are on par with Sony / Warner Bros. / Paramount / Disney, not any better or worse. The ""extras"" are sorely missing. I'm really getting tired of certain studios setting up for the ""double dip"" by not including the basic extras from their dvd couterparts. Yes, I did purchase this movie, but I feel cheated having to pay this much to enjoy Behind Enemy Lines in Hi-def, when M:I:3 looks a lot better, is packed with features, and costs less. Come on Sony, Fox, & Disney step up your Hi-def game."
2,"The qualities of ""Behind Enemy Lines""","The good:-A few good action scenes-Hackman is a serious admiralThe bad:-All the other action scenes-The story is some nonsenseThe strange:-The admiral resigning at the end? After risking his life for that no-good pilot? Ain't that nonsense?The awards for:-Worst Character-Owen Wilson's Character-Best Character(s)-Hackman's and Charles Malik Whitfield's charactersThe overall:I have seen better movies than this. If you like war movies, I recommend something better like ""The Patriot"" or something because this one is not the one."
1,Historical?,"As the US European Command A-2 (Director of Air Intelligence) during this phase of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, I was surprised to see the ending -- what happened to the admiral and pilot. Historical? No way! The only plane shot down was a single-seat US Air Force F-16 pioted by Capt McBrien (sp?) while on combat air patrol (CAP), no cameras. Some naval F-14s carried film-loaded cameras in pods, but most of the imagery pin-pointing mass graves came from U-2s and satellites (and good coordination with French peacekeepers on the ground). So, this movie was fiction. It could have conveyed a better message, a better review of the decay of the former Yugoslavia and the dominant role of Serbian forces. But the producers decided action via fiction was better than learning fact."
3,Surround Sound Fun,"When we purchased our home theater surround sound system, both of the salesmen asked us what would be the first DVD we would view upon it. Being a great fan of the beach landing scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"", I replied to the salesmen that ""Saving Private Ryan"" would be our choice. Both of the salesmen exclaimed that the best current movie soundtrack for surround sound systems was ""Behind Enemy Lines"". We have recently purchased this DVD more or less to test out its soundtrack. We do enjoy the movie, and while it is not a classic by any means, some people will enjoy it just for the plot, actions scenes, etc. But for us, the payoff was the soundtrack. Out of the approximately 25 DVDs we own, this one approaches most closely the feeling of true three-dimensional sound, and that alone could serve as motivation to own it."
3,Awesome 10 minutes,"A very good action flick, nothing to do beside great war movies but the missile pursuit sequence and the dts soundtrack are enough to put in in my collection."
4,"""The grandson of TOP GUN""","This movie is really good if: you expect cool looks, effects, cutting, soundtrack, camera angels, slo-mo and ""some jerry bruckheimer style"". I won't explain the plot because it is not needed {considering here written adjectives..}. Being a Slovakian I must say that nobody has shot the beauties of the region looking so cool. Go then with flow and enjoy."
2,To shtoopid to be good,"I'm a big Owen Wilson fan, but he needs to stick to comedy. And I love Gene Hackman, so I wanted, I really wanted to like this movie. So I tried really hard to overlook the unlikely escapes, the bad lines, the ridiculous inability of the bad guys to hit Wilson with a hurricane of bullets. In the end, though, this is just a bad movie. I think the scene that sums it up is when Wilson is running through a minefield being chased by enemy soldiers. He's able to outrun the explosions as he trips the mines which (of course) obliterate the pursuing henchmen. Got that? He outran explosions. Save your IQ and do something else with your time."
4,Behind Enemy Lines 1,I've always found this movie to be great since the first time I saw it. Now I finally own it and it works great...although I still see no difference between blue ray and a regular DVD.
5,Good action film,An US Navy pilot is shot down during a recon op in the north of Bosnia during the Bosnia-Croatia conflict.Where there the F18 that he and his aviator were flying were done digitally rolling pictures of the ground and vehicles of the Bosnian army as well a common grave of muslims civilians killed by the occuped forces.So the bosnian forces hit the plane with missiles and shot down the aircraft killing after one of the pilots.The Lt Chris Burnett(Wilson) must save his life and run away from the bosnian forces that are trying to locate him.He must get the pickup location in order to get save by the US Marines.Good action and details.
1,Bad beyond words.,"personally i would've been better watching something else then this stupid picture, i try to be fair when watching it , but they broke too many rules in the film. i thought i was watching a corny army video game with matrix moves in it,that the impression got anyway. owen wilson better stick to comedies because i could'nt take him seriously the lines he's given in this film are corny at best & remind me of the comedies he's done so he never fully shakes off his comedy shadow for a serious role sorry owen. it's a shame that gene hackman a very good serious/comedic actor got mix up in this turkey of a film i hope next time he's a little more careful in scripts he picks. anybody would be better off watching top gun , the tom clancy films anything but this turkey.just thought i should warning you."
1,What the F**K???,"this is the worst movie I have ever seen...What happened? Are people too scared to fly in real jets now days to shoot films like they did in top gun, so they reley on computers to do it for them? I think so! The picture might as well be a cartoon because it looks that bad. If you want to see a movie like this see top gun...Better plot, better acting and much better scenes...and all the flying is real in top gun...this one however should find its way to your local landfill and get crushed by a bulldozer!"
1,Ouch!,"Saw it in the theatre... Well. The kindest thing I can say about it, is that I saw it with someone who speaks a couple foreign languages. He said the translations were really well done.Other than that, it strains credability to the breaking point and then goes charging enthusiasticaly over the edge. But maybe I wasn't in the mood for it.It's supposed to be based on a true story. Sort of. Loosely. There was one scene... the most greusome scene in the movie, I won't say what because it's self evident... It was the only thing about the movie I believed and the only portion I liked.The hero is a blonde, stong-jawed mid-western American; he recklessly gets himself into trouble and is eventually saved by his hard-charging tough superior officer. The foreigners are suspicious, or helpless. It's very simplistic. But if you're looking for a patriotic film, this is it."
4,"Flight, pun intended...","Lt. Chris Burnett is a bored Navy pilot that has requested release from the Navy, since the Navy never provided an opportunity for him to feel worthwhile. As a consequence he and his co-pilot are put on a holiday routine recognizance assignment while he is waiting for the paper work to process. During the flight, they stumble on activity within a demilitarized zone, which they check out after some persuasion by Burnett. This leads to a missile chase that ends with them being shot down behind enemy lines. Behind Enemy Lines offers suspense from the beginning to the end, which can cause mild fatigue of the viewer due to constant alertness."
3,Not What I expected AT ALL,"This movie was great for about the first 30 or 45 minutes of the movie. Afer that, the rest was incredibly predictable! It was similiar to the 1970's film ""BAt 21"" in most aspects, but other than that, you could tell what was going to happen. I agree that it was an excellent movie with great sounds and effects, but the plot was unbelievibly corny!!! I only bought it on DVD to watch the missile chase scene and thats it! I also belive that, just like the critics, another person should have been picked for the lead character. Even though Owen Wilson acts tough at times, his facial expressions are as bad as the writing in this movie. All in all, ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is a great movie with endless possibilities, but no plot. If you want to see a great war-action movie, go see ""Black Hawk Down""."
3,Enjoyable but the story has holes,"While I enjoyed this movie, I was discouraged by several major holes, especially those which would have more clearly showed the immorality of America's agreement to stick its head in the sand and blindly obey the U.N.. Also Owen Wilson's character appears to survive more by (incredible) luck than by skill, and that's disappointing. Nonetheless, there were enough good pieces here for me to enjoy the movie.For a much better, but similar, movie also featuring Gene Hackman, I highly recommend Bat 21. Yet another great similar movie is ""Flight of the Intruder"", though the plot of that movie is much more than just good guys shot down behind enemy lines."
1,Oh dear lord.,"This is also known as Owen Wilson Running. I respect all the actors in this film which makes it harder to tell teh truth about this film, No wait.....it isn't this film is just plain horrible. It tries to re-create the gritsy look of Three Kings but fails miserably in the fact that this is an action movie with no suspense or memorable bits of action. The acting is mediocre at best, apart from Wilson who has no time to act. The ending is just hilarious and manages to spoof itself. Oh well what did I expect?"
1,"Don't bother - another shallow, inaccurate military movie","It was terrible. I suppose if you knew nothing about the military or escape & evasion or survival techniques, you might find it exciting. However, if you have been exposed to the previously listed concepts, you will find the movie a waste of time.I hate movies that make the military look like idiots and that is what this movie does. The main character exercises the worst judgement and is an embarrassment. Virtually everthing he does is contrary to survival principles.On the positive side, it was patriotic. Gene Hackman was, as always, a good actor."
2,A load of rubbish,"This movie was ludicrous. There was little if no character development and the plot was just plain bad. Wilson was acting as if he was still in Zoolander (i.e.: playing an air-headed model) and Gene Hackman did not do himself justice taking on a role in such a poor movie. The idea behind the movie is good but the story is simply unbelievable. The scene where Wilson runs through a minefield tripping 20 mines (""Bouncin'Bettys) and emerges without a scratch is the icing on the cake. The only redeeming quality of the movie are the special effects and the musical score (hence the two stars). Having spent 14 months in Bosnia, I was hoping for an intelligent movie or at least a semi-believable one. I guess I will have to wait to see ""No Man's Land"". DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME WITH THIS MOVIE. If you are still intent on seeing it I will send you my DVD for free. I don't want to taint my movie collection with this one."
1,TERRIBLE!!! MOVIE NEEDS TO STAY BEHIND ENEMY LINES!,"I stayed up until 12:30am on a work night to watch this lousy movie. Sure it is a patriotic them, but the story is lame and unbelievable. The characters (Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman) were WEAK! The writing and story was WEAK. The action was okay. Don't buy this movie! Don't rent it! If someone has it, then you may want to borrow it for free. It wasn't worth my money. I'm just glad I didn't waste my money watching this in the theater. If you want a believable and powerful and intense and patriotic war movie, get ""Black Hawk Down""."
4,"Action-packed movie, like Call of Duty: The movie",This movie has some memorable moments but the amount of action and fighting in here will keep any fan of war movies happy.
2,It should come with dramamine,"The story was great, the plot was intriguing, and the action was well done. However, the director goes for the Blair Witch shaky camera trick. By the end of the film I had a severe case of motion sickness. DO NOT watch this on a big screen TV."
3,Average movie,"This would be a boring movie if it weren't for the direction. Owen Wilson is on the run most of the time and never really fights back. I guess that's understandable because he is surrounded by people trying to kill him. The movie was marketed as being patriotic but really just shows how stupid it is to allow foreign military officers to be in command of another country's soldiers.What makes this movie entertaining is the slick direction of the action scenes. What stood out to me was the scenes where there was no music, just the sound of Wilson running or being chases. Kind of reminded me of the old James Bond movies where you didn't need the music to tell you how to feel. A good rental."
2,Ho Hum. More Hollywood Rubbish,"If you want mindless action and your're not discerning, then this may be the film for you. Personally, I found it to be a big disappointment. The characters (including Hackman's) were shallow and the film was replete with technical inaccuracies. The only character worth cheering for was the 'bad' guy!Sorry. This is a classic 'B' movie."
1,Behind enemy lines~DISSAPOINTING~,"This movie really [stunk] big, lots of plot holes and some very not real action very unreal. Dont see this movie unless you want alot of action. The action was pretty good. Just fake. Owen wilson was very disapointing and hackman just didnt seem as good, didnt put in much effort~"
4,4 and a half stars...,"I really liked this movie. A lot of people didn't, I'm sure, but as an action movie, it does very well. The flight sequence was very well done, especially when they start firing the missiles. The action throughout the whole movie was great, despite probably being unrealistic, but I don't really care about that sort of thing in most movies, because..they're movies. Watch this for the action and the pretty well-done cinematography. Not the plot or character development. There's plenty of action, shooting, and violence for action buffs out there. Go see this, it's cheap enough you can find it for cheap on DVD on ebay or other places."
1,BAD DISC,"THIS DISC WILL NOT DO ANYTHING, AFTER PLACING IT IN MY PSP. ALL OTHER GAMES, MOVIES WORK. THIS ITEM IS NO GOOD."
3,Good movie,"This movie arrived on time and in good condition. It is not going to win any awards, but it has explosions, guns, and planes."
2,Really it's like 2.5 stars.,"Who decided that Owen Wilson could be an action star? He doesn't work as one. He should stick to comedy and helping Wes Anderson create genius movies. This movie is ridiculous and predictable and I really never felt myself pulling for Wilsons character. Actually I found myself saying ""it would be cool if he died right here."" But like I said, it's predictable so that never happened. Not the worst movie, but not that great of one either."
1,Behind door when realism was passed out,"Astonishingly bogus ! I regret I cannot rate it lower than 1 star.I kept hoping the bad guys would kill the aviator and put me out of my misery watching this turkey. Cinematography, lighting and locations were excellent, but the plot was absurd and the script went from one bizzare farce ( like being able to hear bullets coming when you are the target ) to another ( like the bad guys killing the pilot instead of using him as a hostage ). Then there was the memorable scene where the bad guys were standing within 4 feet of the hero in a flat muddy area, but could not find him. Perhaps the worst was the hero hiding under snow / ice for 15 min and jumping out just at the right moment to off the main bad guy. Maybe our boy had a periscope - that would be no more improbable than the rest of this waste of film. Gene Hackman usually indicates a worth-the-money movie. He should be ashamed."
2,"Uhhhh, why did I get this?",This is a one time rental movie and thats about it. I will say that the sound effects are very cool and even better when in surround.
3,Owen Wilson Single Handely Defeats the entire Serbo-Croatian Army!!!!,"Well, not exactly, but pretty close. This movie is the most absurd piece of cinema that I have ever watched. I think the director purposely cast crooked-nose Owen Wilson as some kind of sick joke. This is total fantasy from beginning to end.That said, I did enjoy it on an action movie parody level. It plays out like some kind of cartoon and I encourage anyone with a sense of humor to indulge. Don't expect much and you will not be disappointed. You will finish with a smile on your face."
3,Okay Movie,"I went to this movie without many expectations, my boyfriend dragged me to it. Its an okay action movie with mediocre special effects. The plot though, is another story. Owen Wilson escapes and dodges what seems like thousands of bullets. I'm all for believing Americans are capable of everything, but this movie is a bit too unrealistic."
2,Lots and lots of..........Running,"Owen Wilson must have trained for a marathon prior to making this movie because that's all he did. Yes there is a lot of action but it's mostly him....running.I was expecting to see him shoot it out and do some type of Rambo'ing action with a little comedy mixed in, but unfortunately that didn't happen.The movie is a definite rental, but in the end it's rather disappointing."
4,Good no brainer action movie,"If you're looking for a fast-paced, no brainer movie, then Behind Enemy Lines is a good movie. To enjoy this movie, you have to accept that there are some too heroic and impossible scenes, but get over it. Another thing: don't expect a Black Hawk Down equivalent!"
5,Gentle Composer,From television to motion pictures we've listened to Jerry Goldsmith's music more than sixty years. This collection has some favorites for the fans. The opening Star Trek: First Contact contains one of Jerry's most beautiful themes. Another theme for Star Trek: Voyager also examples his creative power.
2,Not the best available,"Since ""Windows XP networking Inside Out"" is available there is no reason to buy this book any longer..too simple too little info....if you get it cheap you may want to buy, but I would always prefer the above mentioned new book."
1,Useless,This book is useless because it assumes that everthing just works they way it is supposed to work - but alas it never does and then the book doesn't give you any clue what to do - SIMPLY DO NOT BUY IT - the XP help is more usefull.
1,scam,this book is poorly informative copy of the help text that can be found in windows xp. there is no trouble shooting context worth noting.
2,Get what you pay for,"Well I bought these to keep around my shop for their light weight, did not plan on using them a lot so did not buy a good set but found out wrong. The frustration using them was intense because they would not adjust with one hand, the head jams against the side and is very sloppy. I also needed to hold some stainless steel pipe and they just slipped on it, had to get out the 30 year old Ridgid cast iron for that. Best for the home handy man to show his friends in his garage while drinking a few cold ones, not much for using."
1,Peepers Makeup Eyeglasses with +1.5,This purchase was a waste of money. They did not magnify any better than a magnifying mirror. The design is flawed in that I had to hold them in a adjusted way in order to put on my eye make up. I used them once. They seemed to be designed by someone who didn't use them. I was very disappointed especially for what I paid.
1,I'm with the previous review/opinion ...,"How can you make a choice on clothing if there is no picture and no desciption or indication of what size the ""large"" is?"
3,Decent movie,"I originally bought this movie for someone else but I am glad I decided to watch it too. I have seen better Michele Williams acting but she did OK. This movie is about a terrorist act which I don't care for which is why I only gave the movie 3 stars. I don't think Michele Williams was guilty of bad acting, I just don't think she should have ever been cast in this role."
1,Boring,I kept waiting for this movie to take off but it never did. I finally launched it into the trash about 45 minutes in.
1,Just Shoot Me,"How do i hate thee? Let me count the ways...#1 The trailer suggests a movie that is at least action-y. It is anything but. The story starts in the head, stays in the head, and ends in the crazy, moronic and infuriatingly morally equivocating head of the main character.#2 It made no #@$! sense.#3 I paid hard-earned money for this excrement-stained drivel.#4 I could have spent this time doing something fun and interesting like clipping my toenails, or perhaps even trimming my cat's nosehair.#5 My head hurts. See #s 1-4."
2,"Their definition of ""fast-paced thriller"" is very different from mine.","The plot was very simple and predictable. The love between the main characters didn't develop realistically and just seemed to happen out of nowhere. The only reason why I kept watching was because I was waiting for the ""fast pace thriller"" part to kick in...it never did. By the time I checked the time bar, 1 hour and 15 minutes had already gone by...might as well finish it and I did that while getting chores around the kitchen done."
3,Excellent performance by Williams.,"Incendiary starring Michelle Williams and Ewan McGregor is an uneven, slow moving film but overall - I found this drama worth watching thanks to Williams's brave and heart-wrenching performance. Williams grabs the viewer in the first frame of the film, she is magnetic and the little boy who plays her son is so darn cute! Williams holds this movie together (flawless British accent by the way) - I can't believe this is the same girl who once starred in that silly, little show - Dawson's Creek? This film is about the downward sprial of a woman who's life gets ripped to shreds after her son and husband are killed in a terrorist attack. Incendiary falls flat here and there but it's still worth seeing. Enjoy!"
2,Waste of time,"Yet another pointless movie that I didn't enjoy. Why do they keep making this trash? The three main characters (loose woman, sleazy reporter, policeman) are all worthless human beings - pure anti-heroes, that we are supposed to feel empathy for. Right? Wrong! What's more I found much of the film disorientating and confusing. I've heard the book is better (well, it can't be worse) which is why I think the movie was so confusing in parts - I mean, is the son there or not? It is a dream or are we in the woman's head? Yeah, I get the message - terrorism is nasty and it ruins lives, but terrorists are also people with thoughts and motivations. Get this message movie makers - make something to be enjoyed, not to be depressed about. For the cast involved in this movie, it is a very disappointing result. I'd give it a miss!"
2,"Routine Romantic Thriller, Good Performances","""Incendiary"" stars Michelle Williams as an unnamed London mother who meets and begins an affair with journalist Jasper Black (Ewan McGregor). While her husband and young son are attending an Arsenal football game, they are killed when a series of terrorist bombs goes off. Director Sharon Maguire juggles a number of plots -- the affair, the deaths of husband and child, the mother's frantic search for their bodies, her deep-seated guilt over the affair, and an unlikely relationship that develops after the bombing. The film begins well and Williams draws us in, but when the plot tendrils begin to extend every which way, it degenerates into a bloated melodrama.The Widescreen, R-rated film contains no bonus extras."
2,An odd movie,An interesting idea for a movie. But it turned out to be an odd and slow moving story. What a waste to have actor like Ewan McGregor in it. He didn't have chance to show any acting skills. Rented the DVD from Netflix and glad I didn't spend more money on it. Wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
5,The pros and cons of a vegetarian diet,"In Transition To Vegetarianism: An Evolutionary Step, Doctor Rudolpf Ballentine presents an informed and persuasive survey of the value and reasoning to a vegetarian diet. Dr. Ballentine's informative text is laced with health relevant information such as meat-eaters having three times as many heart attacks as vegetarians, that a vegetarian diet decreases osteoporosis dramatically, that in endurance tests vegetarians had more than twice the stamina and strength of meat-eaters, and that the vegetarian diet is a time-honored technique for promoting alertness and clarity of consciousness. Ideal for the non-specialist general reader, Transition To Vegetarianism covers red meat, poultry, fish, and the question of milk and eggs in a vegetarian diet. If you are considering the pros and cons of a vegetarian diet for yourself, begin with reading Dr. Rudolf Ballentine's Transition To Vegetarianism."
2,a poor guide for those who cannot digest milk,"I bought this book on the recommendation of my homeopath, who had worked under Rudolph Ballentine. I was disappointed. While the nutrition in terms of meat's value and replacement in the diet may be of great help to my sister, who *is* vegetarian, I found the ""dairy is good for you"" message questionable in terms of my personal experience and in terms of different articles I've read. I'll take a sensible vegan cookbook any day."
5,Worth the investment - when you are trying to make your dollar stretch!,"I put both of these in my veggie drawer and my veggies lasted twice as long! Definitely worth the investment!!!!!!!!!!! I am back ordering refills!!! I tell all my friends about this product! My produce and veggies in the summertime last so much longer and taste wonderful! I have tried so many other products and these are the best. You must take your veggies out of the plastic bags but you can leave your strawberries, or blueberries in those little plastic containers in your veggie/fruit drawer and the E.G.G. will work fine."
4,It's a belt...,"...you put it on your car and it makes stuff rotate! :^)Seriously, Gates belts have a good reputation and this one seems well made. Amazon's price is good, and Prime shipping makes it even better!"
5,Great Deal for this price,"It might have been made in china but it does the job. The OD green color is a bit off from real LC-2 suspenders and backpacks, but it attaches easily and holds your survival gear just great."
5,Great bag at Great price,"Got my butt pack in short order about as quick as post office will run. First off this pack is just like the military issue packs it is quality not heavy. Hump your gear a couple of miles and see what I mean. This pack has the tabs for your LBE suspenders, standard belt clips and the name tag plate at the top with a handle on top as well. It is a good size bag. Should handle most of your personal short range stuff. I use mine hunting, the bag holds MRE flash light butchering tools and any survival items that you might need. Bottom line Great little bag at a great price."
3,good bag to hold extras,"This is a decent size bag, the material of the bag feels like decent quality so as not to rip easily from what you pack. Downsides of the bag are the stitching - not double stitched, and the attachment locations feel too low. It did come with alice clips, and also has some straps on the back you can use to attach to a belt or a bag. The problem is that the attachments are located too low on the bag, causing it to sag. The straps sewn on the sides that look like molle straps are not molle. In the picture they provide, it appears you have two horizontal molle straps running around the bag. It is actually one think strap, too large for molle and too wide. I'm still going to use the bag, but probably just to hold light weight stuff or maybe as a small game dump bag."
4,"Mixed bag, with flashes of greatness","Wow, what a mixed decade. There's quite a few clunkers in here -- I'm guessing they were chosen when Hef was still married -- but the later the year gets, the better, with Heather Kozar and the incomparable Karen McDougal being the key highlights. This is a good sampler, but if you already know you'd like the Karen McDougal or Heather Kozar DVDs, just go for them: These segments are just snipped from their full-length productions."
3,"A pretty lame attempt at ""funny"" but o.k. nonetheless.","First off, this is nothing like Indiana Jones. The only thing the two have in common is that the word ""artifact(s)"" is brought up in both movies.The attempt at humor in this film could come off to many as just bad directing/acting/execution. I think maybe some of it would make a 10-13 year old laugh, and while the movie is rated R there is no bad language and nothing more than people getting punched in the face. So don't be afraid to let your youngster see this.The action is o.k. and the plot is weak. While if you're looking to collect every Jean-Claude Van Damme film out there this review probably won't stop you from buying this. If you are just looking for some good, ""Muscles from Brussels"" action though I recommend looking else where."
1,Sofia Milos is all the money!,"The Order sheds light on a religious sect dating back to the Crusades. Having survived throughout the centuries, it aims at fulfilling a prophecy, which would plunge mankind into a third world war...In short, the acting and the dialogues are extremely weak (Van Damme and Charlton Heston really disappoint with their performances!), while the plot and the setting, are actually very good, therefore, the potential for a great movie was definitely there if only the actors and writers could... act and write!As for the rating, if you're going to have it rated R at least give it the sex and/or the violence. If not, give it the proper rating i.e. PG-13.Overall, far from being a masterpiece, it just might provide for an evening's entertainment if in a really silly mood and/or intoxicated. 1 StarsIf Van Damme movies is what you had in mind, check out the Legionnaire and Timecop."
3,OH! SOFIA!,This is a typical Van-Damm movie and its not to bad really. Why his releases are being relegated to strictly video now is unknown to me. One high note is the...local cop that befriends him when he is knee high in trouble. Her name is Sofia Milos and you can expect to see more of her I bet. Her...eyes and voluptuous body only crank up her dynamic screen prensence. Rarely have I seen such a good mix of...beauty and talent. I hope she makes her own movies now. Viva la Sofia!!!
2,Van Damnes worst,"Im a big fan of Van Damne,but when i saw this movie i was really disapointed,the setting is dull,the story is dull and the guy he fights dull.I love Van Damnes other movie,but this is the only one that sux."
4,Where To Begin?,"Well, first of all the viewers of this movie should not take it seriously. It's not that type of movie. Its more of a campy/spunky type action film. Yeah, it is a lot like Indiana Jones, and isn't Van Dammes best, but still has many high points to it. If you want Van Dammes best acting DON'T start here; go watch In Hell, Wake of Death, Lionheart, or maybe Timecop for that. For his action/martial arts skills this isn't a bad place to go. It has quite a few good action scenes in it. Van Damme is always cool as hell and has some good lines. The ending is also pretty good as well. With the ending you get Van Dammes best kick(jumps and glides) out of all his movies he has ever done, even at his older age. The movie as a whole isn't nowhere near as bad as a lot of people think. It's just another action film that Van Damme fans and MAYBE action fans should love. But like I said its NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY."
3,THE BELGIAN WAFFLES,"Jean Claude vanDamme's movies are obviously not meant to be taken seriously. The Belgian actor has always relied on his physical presence and kickboxing action to fill theatres or rent movies. In THE ORDER, he tries a more comic approach, in his attempts to locate his missing archaeologist father and a rare religious document. Brian Thompson has an uninspired role as Cyrus, the leader of a distaff cult of the Order, hence the title of this movie. There are some fun kickboxing scenes; the car chases are bland compared to those orchestrated by John Woo; and Sofia Milos is attractive as the lady cop who joins van Damme in his quest. I agree that Charlton Heston should have played the father; he's wasted in a cameo role. Pino Donaggio (Carrie, Dressed to Kill) does a nice score for the movie. Ben Cross overplays his villainous cop role with plum relish.Standard van Damme fare, so don't expect anything more."
2,Another Stinker,"Van Damme is growing older while his movie budget continues to shrink. The fake CGI fire scenes are hysterical, as are the dark action sequences where nothing is visible except a few punches and the sound of several groans.I'm surprised at the decline, and always remain hopeful Van Damme can make a comeback and convince a studio to finance a theatrical release. Until that time, the direct to video ... stream remains steady and constant...."
2,not his best,Van Damme is not the best actor we have and he needs a good cast to make a movie this has no other stars and the story is boring not his best not even good enough to call his movie to me just skip it
2,don't bother,"pretty lame stuff, though I do love the Isreali Peacekeeper, she's a badass and her shirt lowers by one button each time she hits someone. Other than that, there's nothing here. I keep hoping the Jean-Claudemeister will make something decent again, but to no avail this time either. The last decent flick he made was Timecop. This movie revolves around the ""Order"" that began with some warriors of the Crusades that became disenchanted with the way things were going and made their own religion calling for an armageddon or something. The script doesn't care either."
2,Go Away Van Damme!,"Van Damme needs to stay in Israel and never come back after this movie. Charlton Heston of all people, makes a horrible cameo and I was appalled. I've never been so disgruntled in my life after watching this. Oy Vey! No more. I can't take the pain and suffering, why do I keep renting these Van Damme movies. I guess I'm a nice guy."
2,Van Damme my man is Slippin!!!!,"I bought this dvd hopin for the best,but wound up with a lackluster Van Damme clunker,lol!!! I cant believe Charlton Heston put his name on the credits. I also cant believe Ben Cross went from Chariots of Fire,to this mess,poor guy !!! Save up your money an get Lionheart on dvd or the Quest,much better Van Damme vehicles."
1,God Damn!!!,"This is one really bad movie! (That's bad as in terrible) And it's not even in the ""so bad it's good"" category. It's just bloody awful. Don't bother watching it. Studying drying paint would me more entertaining. Unfortunately, I could'nt give it no stars as the system does'nt allow it. You have been warned!"
2,Modern Spelling OK but why modern grammar?,"I bought this book even after finding out that it was in modern spelling. I can see that modern spelling would help make the reading of the Wycliffe New Testament easier. But what I do not like is the tampering with the wording of the text. Some of the grammar has been changed into ""modern"" form and some of the vocabulary has even been changed. Where the original has ""clepid"" this one says simply ""called"". Yet many of the Middle English words are retained and then glossed in the margin. Surely anyone interested in the Wycliffe New Testament can understand the meaning of ""thou shalt"" which in this ""modernization"" is given as ""thou shall"" which sounds horrible!! This author, he ""am"" wrong!!"
2,"Why, oh why?","I am trying to think of a person who would be interested in an altered version of this translation. I am honestly drawing a blank. To me, the original language and spelling used are important. I look at this for its historical and literary value. I am not looking for the best translation ever made with updated spelling. If I want that, I have my preferences, and they are more modern. Their edition of Tyndale's New Testament didn't change the spelling. Why here?"
3,overpriced for number of pages and quality of paper used,"Stories are good and inspiring, but still does not merit the cost"
4,Story Reader is not the same as Story Reader Video +,"This backpack was designed for the Story Reader unit. I was mistaken in ordering it for the Story Reader Video +. We had to modify the pockets for the cassettes by clipping the threads. It worked out ok but it is important to know there is a difference. Other than that, the backpack was very well made and sturdy."
5,I LOVE MY REMO FIBERSKIN FRAME DRUM!!,"This is my first frame drum and I love it. It has such a beautiful rich tone and I can even play it as a drum head on a shell. A high quality and versatile instrument at an amazing price. I plan to purchase the other available sizes in the future, and I recommend this instrument to anyone who enjoys expressing themselves through music."
2,Small Bag,Seems a bit smaller than what the dimensions are. Not very comfortable for the dog and my dog is the same breed as the picture on this item. Would recommend this for a very small dog like a mini dachshund or yorkie but best as a book bag.
5,Something For Us Drunks...,"As far as I know there are only a couple different discs that can provide you with the essential Nathan Abshire version of ""Hip Et Taiau"", and this strikes me as the best of those sources since along with a slew of other killer tracks it also includes the title track by Lawrence Walker, which is also a winner. If you are already seriously into Cajun music, then don't hesitate, this compilation is for you. If not, then I'd say this would appeal to the type who is into Junior Kimbrough or Hound Dog Taylor or any other music that sounds best when you're boozed up and out of your mind. Sound like you? Of course it does."
5,A GREAT CAMERA,I own a Canon 20D SLR as well as a Canon G5 and a Nikon S1. I bought the S2 IS for the zoom as well as Canon's quality. We ride ATVs a lot and I don't like taking the SLR with all the dust generated along the trail. This little camera gives me the zoom that I didn't have with the other portable cameras and the IS is a great addition. I have taken pictures and movies with the camera and the shots come out very nice. I like the fact that it uses 4 AA batteries so even if my rechargeables fade I can always pick up replacements.
2,"Okay. Never great, then died.","I have owned this camera for approximately 16 months.Sometimes great photos, but mostly blurry and unreliable.One day, camera stopped working - no clue what went wrong (not mistreated).I have owned three Canon ELPHs over five+ years - never a problem.Loser camera, switched back to my Olympus C5060 wide zoom - beautiful image quality - and it still works!I may try the G7, but not sure if I should buy another Canon (except for ELPH line)."
5,Good camera,This is my first digital camera and I think this will be the only one for a long period. It's perfect for the people who are learning how to shoot and for the people with experience in the topic of taking a good fotography.
3,"Very Decent Camera, but there are better ones out there","This is a nice camera, the 12x optical zoom is a great feature, and the macro mode (shooting stuff really close up) works great. I just find it a bit too bulky, and there are newer, comparably priced cameras out there that offer better features."
2,Not the best,"I have had this camera for one week and it is going back today. I took it to my daughters cheer competition and every time I turn around it said to change the batteries and then it would shut off on me. I have taken a total of 85 pictures on 4 sets of batteries. I missed so many good shots because I spent so much time changing batteries at the most inconvenient times. The manual says I should be get 130 pictures on 1 set of AA batteries. Combined with this and the fact the lens cap falls off all the time, the flash does not automatically pop up and it's large size I think I will be looking into other options."
3,"Great camera, lousy documentation","We had the family Easter Hunt yesterday and my father-in-law brought his new canon camera. We spent 1/2 hour going through the manual to figure out the basics and found a lot of errors in manual. Much of what we tried didn't work, including how to erase all images. It had somehow protected an image and we couldn't delete it. The reference pages were often wrong too. Luckily one friend had a similar canon camera and could give lessons. It does have a lot of great features but the documentation should have been better. It may have been returned if someone hadn't been able to teach the features. We also blew off the advanced features such as the special effects and used a media editor program, roxio emc8 instead. When you ignore the over 70 year old market and don't take the documentaiton seriously that is a big strike against the product. Tech stuff is hard enough for many people so at least canon should have put more effort into their instructions."
3,This is a great camera that we loved,This is a great camera that we loved. I have to say loved because it just broke after only 2 years of use. Some sort of wiring/short out issue and we have been told to stop using the camera immediately. Other than this issue we had really liked this camera. It takes great pictures and is very easy to operate. We had researched a number of mid-level cameras in the price range and went with Canon due to the reputation. I think we are going to go with a Fuji this time to try it out.
2,Returned it...,"Read all the great reviews and wanted a mega zoom with advanced features for me and point and shoot capability for the little lady... well, the IS feature doesn't work too well, at leats on ""auto"" which made this camera a no go for us. Any picture my wife took on auto came out blurry (yes, even with a flash etc etc). The viewfinder and the lcd screen were both poor (hard to look through without pressing your face against the screen in the first case and way too small in the latter case). Returned it and went with the Fuji s6000 which has been great thus far. The flash on the fuji can be enabled or disabled and pops up automatically if enabled (as opposed to most of the super zooms that have to be manually raised) - again this feature was necessary for the point and shoot auto quick pics of the kids."
1,"Excellent camera, but.....","I bought this camera because it was recommended by Consumer's Reports as being the top of the line in its class. I used it a number of years and it was indeed an excellent camera until it developed what is known as problem code E18. The problem is a break-down in the lens mechanism: In the beginning the lens will go out with difficulty and will retract with even more difficulty. Eventually the lens will not retract at all; it stays out permanently and the camera becomes unusable. The cost of repair is prohibitive and there is no assurance that the problem will not recur after the camera is repaired. Canon will not acknowledge that there is such a problem as code E18 but I went to Google and found out that, despite Canon's denials, the problem is prevalent on quite a few of their camera models and there are too many complaints on file to ignore them.For the time being it is best to refrain from buying any Canon camera until they admit that there is a problem and correct it."
1,Defect?,"Maybe I got a defect, but every single picture was blurry or dark. I changes settings, but nothing helped. I sent it back and hope to find another one to purchase!"
1,Horrible experience with this camera,"Just as everybody describes here, 15 months after purchase, suddenly comes this black screen. The viewfinder and LCD are completely blackout, while menu can still show properly and also the previously taken pix can be reviewed. An obvious manufacturing defect! However, when I called their customer service, they wanted $135.00 for repair, another option is $175.00 for a refurbished S3. How outrageous it is!Don't ever think of Canon again!"
3,Canon Powershot S2 Digital Camera,"This is an overall great camera, but I have to knock Canon for thier exeptionally poor ability to own up to a manufacturing defect. I also recieved the dreaded BLACK SCREEN that others have experienced after owning the camera for exactly 24 months to the date of purchase. Unfortunately, they give you some lame spiel about a flat fee of $127 for repair. To boot, it can only be repaired in Illinois, so you have all the trouble of sending it out and waiting, waiting for the repair and then waiting to get it back. I can't say I am thrilled with Canon at this point in time considering the camera was initially almost $500 +taxes. Canon needs to step up to the plate a bit. God knows I have shelting out alot of hard earned money!"
5,A great digitial camera from Canon,"I bought the Canon S2 camera to replace my 2-yr old Nikon Coolpix 3200, as that one was really acting up. This camera is a dream come true. Great pictures, stabilized zoom is a must-have - my hands shake at the last minute when shooting, hence this helps dramatically. We have used this camera for shooting at various light conditions (evening, night) and the results are always great. Don't expect it to beat an SLR, though. The feature for single color selection (rest of image is B/W) is a cool tool to experiment - had some nice effects, when we used this feature at a county fair. Nice job, Canon !!"
5,Canon Powershot S2 IS,"Love this camera! Take alot of animal photos so needed the zoom and the video capability. Recommend getting the Scandisk Ultra II or Ultra III 512 or 1 gg cards. Sony rechargeable world wide charger with either 2300 or 2500 rated batteries(two sets), lens hood and adapter and at least one UV Lens to put on the adapter which will protect your primary lens and lcd protector($3.95).1/2007 - STILL LOVE THIS CAMERA!"
3,Great Camera for the 'Wanna-Be' Pro,"There are too many bells & whistles to describe here, but Canon has provided a camera that allows the photograher new features to create his/her perfect shot. The various settings are not easy for a newcomer to learn, but Canon has made the setting icons fairly intuitive.I would say that the only negative we have found with this camera is that moving subjects continue to come out very blurry. Stop-action still doesn't work very well. Since we take many 'action' photos, that is why the review is probably lower than we would have given it. If you take mostly still subjects, then this is a great camera to use!"
3,Powershot S2 IS --- Defective Optical Unit,This is a good camera when it is working. Canon refuses or is just ignorant of the fact that the optical unit in the product is DEFECTIVE.There are many of us out here who are being charged $119-127 for a repair. How convenient that this part seems to last about 1 year just when the warranty expires. There are a few people who after becoming irate and speaking to managers have gotten this fix free of charge.Symptom: The camera screen is black both on the LCD and on via the viewfinder.Cause:Defective Optical UnitSee what others have been through with this problem:http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/digital-cameras/canon-powershot-s2is_question.html?qid=3894
1,After 3-4 yrs the screen goes black,"Do your own search on google forCanon PowerShot S2 IS Digital Camera complaints.This is a huge complaint, there are alot of persons with this same problemand Canon won't recall the product OR pay for it to be fixed.You call Canon, complain to them, no satisfactory answer.Then you call BBB and complain to them.2 months later Canon calls you and says send the camera to them.They fix it free, it's a hassle--but you don't get ripped off $190.A $499. camera 3 yrs later worth $110. and Canon wants $190.+shipping to fix it. What a joke.Check into a Nikon, about the same price for a 10X better camera.DON'T buy this camera model, it is already on it's last leg."
1,BAD CAMERA,Mine CANON S2 IS is about 3+ years old. it has couple of problems Black as been experienced by few other users. I am also seeing outdoor pitures completely washed out. I was planning to use it for couple of more years. Now I am forced to look for other camera.Please don't rely on this camera (CANON) .Will CANON listen and fix the issue?
4,Focus,The camera is great with the exceptions:1)I have trouble focusing with it. Even on auto the lens seems blurry. Pictures are great though.2)The lens cover does not stay on - it appears to need another gasket around the inside of the lens cover.3)It is a bit heavier than I expected it to be.4) I have been able to get some great hummingbird and quail pictures with this camera.
2,Poor Optics or Poor Customer Service?,"Love my camera, BUT....Great camera, especially the 12x zoom, but when I noticed early on that all of my shots had a BLURRY portion in about 1/4 of each photo, I returned the camera to Canon. After 2 months, they sent the camera back to me saying everything was normal. Hmmmm.Here, I know something is wrong: if blurry photos are normal, then I'm unimpressed with the camera's optics. However, I'm leaning toward the more likely problem: poor customer service. It appears they didn't care to take the time to fix the problem.Not impressed. Next time, I'll spend my money on a Nikon."
5,new camera,"I absolutely love my camera. I purchased it for the zoom features and portrait setting. My chirldren play sports and I am not always in a postition were i can get close, and this is exactly what I wanted. I would advise to practice all the settings to find the ones that work for your subject. I have recommended it to everyone I know and you can't beat the price."
2,Great camera while it worked (17months),"My wife and I liked the camera a lot, but our experience with Canons is that they last until just past the warranty. Not going to buy a Canon next time."
4,Energizer Bunny?,"Since purchasing the S2 I've found that I have to change the batteries every time I leave the camera overnight or longer. Otherwise, great purchase!"
2,image died,"Excellent camera, for about a year. Shortly after warranty expired the image started to fail - nothing in viewfinder except icons. This could be corrected for a while by repeatedly turning on and off but it has now died completely, about 18 months old. Very disappointed in Canon. I was offered a refurbished model for $200 as part of their 'customer loyalty' program when new model is offered for $280!! Very generous!! This customer will not be very loyal. Fool me once..."
5,"Strong, amazing and versatile digital camera.","Excellent camera and amazing zoom. I feel as a professional.I do not change it by any other I know.I compared with an 10X Kodak equivalent and the mine was so much superior.Nevertheless I realize there are two main defects:One: It is not possible to monitor the available - remaining memory (time) in the SD card. It is recommendable to buy a 1GB or 2GB card, because the video mode is weighted. Also buy a SD card to kept it as stand-by.Control the remaining time by your watch.Second: To have flash you need to pull up the lamp by hand , if not, no flash is gotten. Cannon decided to eliminate this automatism by any reason I do not know."
2,Excellent - But only for as long as it works,"The camera gave amazing results while it worked. Unfortunately, for me it was only for about 15 months - just 3 months after the warranty expires.Looking up various digital photography forums on the net, I found that the CCD failure that happened to my S2 is not uncommon in S2-IS and in S1-IS before it.I'd advise ppl planning to buy later cameras in the series S-3IS, S-5IS etc. to first look up the digital photography forums and investigate whether Canon has fixed this CCD failure problem. Otherwise you run a risk of being left with a $500 paper-weight after 1-2 years."
5,Meant for great shots...,"I had been hunting for a digital camera that offered 5+ MP, 10-12X optical zoom with image stabalization and was under $400. I spent weeks hunting through stores in U.S. Reviewed Sony, Kodak, Nikon cameras offering similar features. I must say, Canon outperformed them all in terms of shoot-modes, picture quality, ease-of-operation, print features, ergonomics etc. It is sleek, stylish and a good performer. Where it took the candy from me, is in it's vari-angle LCD and impressive shutter speed. Someone complained about pooor performance in low-light. Please re-read the manual carefully and try again. I chose S3 IS blind-folded after seeing how S2 IS performed.MY VERDICT: If you own it, you WILL adore it."
1,Do not purchase this camera,"I loved this camera when I first purchased it after searching far and wide for the best point and shoot. After spending $350 of my grad student salary, I happily used it for 1.5 years. It then developed the BSoD or ""Black Screen of Death"" (google it to see how common it is, one forum has over 700 posts). It was still under warranty at the time, and Canon fixed it no problem. Again, I was pleased. Flash forward to 2010, and the BSoD returns. This time I am far out of warranty and do not want the hassle of a camera that breaks every 3 years. I'm checking out other brands."
3,"O.K. Camera, not great for the price.","I buy equipment for my company. I bought several cameras to try out, and this was one of them. This camera is decent, but a little difficult to use, and unless you fiddle with a bunch of settings, the photos are not great. I don't like the automatic mode. We went with the Fuji Finepix S5200."
4,Really Good Camera,"I upgraded to this camera after using a Nikon 2.5 MP for a number of years. This camera is great. The zoom works well and gives vivid pics at 5 MP. Its easy enough to use and the ability to tape live video is an added bonus. The software for transfering the images works real smoothly to the extent that once the camera has been plugged in it opens the software immediately.The LCD is difficult to use in bright sunlight but then the traditional viewfinder is a good alternative. Cannon should sell the unit with a larger memory card, 16 MB just does not cut it. I bought a 512 card and now I can tape up to 2.5 minutes on the highest quality setting.The camara is not too heavy and the flip out LCD takes some getting used too, but this is a great buy and lots of fun."
4,Canon PowerShot S2,I was pleaantly surprised at some of the assecaries that I got with the camera such as additional lense extensions and filters. I am very happy with this purchase!
1,Dreaded E18 Error,"After 16 months, my camera stopped working. The lens does not retract and I am getting the E18 error. Canon wants me to pay to repair because I am outside the 12 month warranty period. I am extremely disappointed."
3,A good camera for the price,"I have been pretty happy with this camera. It was purchased as a replacement for my Canon A70 which, after about 7 years, was acting squirrelly and needed to be replaced. I wanted another Canon with higher resolution, a good heavy body and a better zoom than 3x. The S2 IS fit the bill. With a 12x zoom and 5MP resolution it takes wonderful shots.On the downside, I was hoping to use it to take pictures at my daughter's sporting events. Not professional pictures, but good pictures. The A70 did this well with it's ""action"" setting. That setting is not available on the S2 IS and is really worthless in action situations. I also have a bit of trouble with red-eye. Rather than multi-flashes (like many digitals) there is a red light that the subject looks at. Of course, this isn't a solution if you are taking candids.All in all, I have been satisfied with the camera once I learned to work within it's limitations."
1,I was really surprised by Canon,"I had Canon PowerShot S2 IS for almost 2 years. Last month I got all money back, $449 - American Express extended warranty, barely made it. It had so many problems, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw almost 5 stars as an average from over 500 reviews! I highly encourage everyone to start reading the reviews from WORST to BEST, this will give a really true picture. I found all problems I had experienced have been covered, most important of which are:1) Blurry and out-of-focus pictures2) Memory card compatibility issue3) Long delays for focusing4) Quality of the picturesI couldn't believe the quality of cheap Canon's ELPHs - these tiny cameras produced much richer and much higher quality pictures. Canon really surprised me. I was lucky the camera stopped working eventually and I got all money back. I had Canons all my life, and now I am thinking about something else. They should have never put their name on a product with so many obvious issues."
3,a little disapointing......,"I bought this camera for my dau....It isn't always clear.......The zoom isn't what we thought, and inside pictures don't come out always.......when it is good it is great!!! but when it isn't it ISN""T!!!!!like one is good....very next pic is bad, nothing changed, soooooo I wouldn't buy it again,but I can't really say it is completely bad either........ so I give it a 3......"
2,Canon Powershot S2 IS = Unhappy,"I thought this camera was the greatest point and shoot when I tried a friends. I wanted a point and shoot so I didn't have to lug out all my SLR camera equipment when I just wanted to take a snapshot.My Major dissapointment with this camera is the viewfinder and screen. Both have terrible resolution. I couldn't make out what I was shooting half the time. Everything else on it was ok, I took it back anyway and got the Sony Cybershot."
5,Canon S2IS digital camera,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she wanted a hi-power optical zoom camera. She's taken still pictures and videos, and used the telephoto and the macro function and hasn't even looked at the owner's manual. The camera is comfortable to hold, easy to use and the menu system is quite intuitive. The image stabilization works very well, and the pictures are clear and sharp. Color rendition is excellent. Some reviews have mentioned some chromatic aberrations (vignetting or purple fringing), but in truth that even occurs with digital SLR's and some lenses. We haven't found any aberration in my daughter's pictures, from macro to full zoom, indoors or out. The S2IS is not a professional camera, but if you want an easy to use, hi-zoom camera for every day use and family vacations, you won't be disappointed with an S2IS."
4,very nice!,"When using the viewfinder, the colors are slightly tinted green/blue. Pix themselves are true to color. Display screen is a bit small by today's standards. Form factor is tough: where to put the thing? Doesn't fit easily into any but the larger pockets. Don't like using a neckstrap. Am considering the grip strap.Regardless of the above niggling considerations, the zoom is fabulous, the antishake feature is terrific, and the pix themselves, impeccable."
5,Canon really got it right.,"All I can say is if you don't like this digital camera, you must not like digital cameras. No it's not an DSLR, but's it's the next best thing to one. If you don't want to carry around 10 pounds of extra lens and all the trimings, this camera is for you. It takes a while to learn to use, but then that's half the fun. After you do learn all the features of this camera you will love it. Besides it's a Canon, what else could you want?"
2,"Black Screen Problem, nightmare","I have purchased S2IS on Aug, 2005. I have been very happy with it until early this year. Black Screen occured after 18 months i got this camera. At the beginning, i didn't know what had happened. by swithching between shot and replay mode several times, plus turning on and off a few times, i got it back function. After that, i didn't even get a chance to use it any more, then i found it totally failed today one day before i am leaving for a vacation. After i did a few research online, i am much sure it is what other customers called black screen problem. Planning call canon company next week. Don't anticipate too much. If they don't accept this manufacture default, and ask me to pay for the fix. I will be very disppoited. Cross finger."
5,manufacturer's seal?,did anyone who purchased their canon s2 through amazon have an official canon seal on their package. I believe mine is an open item because it did not have the seal
1,Excelent,"Good price, excelent optical zom and video, very easy to operate, and full manual to special picture"
1,One Week and Done,The camera worked perfectly for one week and then stopped working permanently. I just sent it off for repairs and have not received a diagnosis as to the root of the problem.
2,no image,"3 times out of 4 on switching the camera on there is no image. when there is an image the camera works fine except for focus at low light levels.i have used canon cameras for many years and this is the most disappointing product from them that I have ever hadIf you can get one that gives an image very time, and you do not want to take photos in low light it would probably be okay"
1,Do not buy a powershot!,"I bought this on amazon just over a year ago.. worked fine till just out of warranty, then all the pictures began to come our overexposed. I sent it into Canon and they want 157 dollars to repair it or replace with a refurbished model. It cost 259 new! I wrote them and told them that I expected a lightly used expensive digital camera to work more than one year, but no dice. I'll never buy another Canon. Beware!"
3,Blurrrry action shots,I really had hoped this camera would be it. I have 3 children all in sports and I wanted one camera to take with me...this is not the one. If there is much of any movement in the shot it is a blur of color.
4,Good Camera,"I am not good at photography, but after taking this camera, I have started liking photography. It's worth it's value."
4,Nice Camera,This is really a nice camera and worth for money. If this had bluetooth connectivity I would have definitely rated this as 5 stars.
4,Canon Powershot S2 IS 5MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom,"Hi,I liked the camera and its performance very much, it satisfied all my expectations. However when I ordered from Amazon, it was told that the product is absolutely nrand new. But When I received the Camera, the Original Canon Box was not sealed pack, it was in open state, this Canon Camera box was within another box. I am not sure why should Amazon open the Canon camera's box seal, that reduces my trust that the product is not used.Anil"
5,Great product.,"Saved a ton buying a refurb. I see no reason to pay the extra for the next model up, this works great and actually focuses faster than the next model up. The only complaint that I have is that it is not as weather proof as the S1 model."
4,Canon Powershot S2 IS 5MP Digital Camera,"I bought this camera for a friend and he loves it. At first he and his wife thought this was more camera than either wanted but it has a auto setting that will allow you to take good pictures without being a ""Camera Person"" It has many advanced features that can be learned if you ever want to progress from the point and shoot mode. If you want a good camera with a lot of zoom this one is hard to beat. It is top rated in its class in Consumers Report. I bought the Powershot S3 IS for myself. It cost about 100 dollars more and it is essentially the same camera with more ISO settings. I would buy one of the two based on my personal wants. I am using a 4 G card in mine and I am very pleased with it."
5,good buy,"I bought it for one year. although the accessories add up another 100 dollars, it is a good camera that I want to recommend."
3,"Good Camera, But With Some Flaws","I've had the camera for about a month, and taken several pictures. Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the photos. I haven't had the same problem with AF that some reviewers mentioned, and none in zoom mode. I bought a lens adapter from lensmateonline along with a polarizing filter, along with a real lens cap and am very pleased. The addition is worth considering.My biggest complaint, and while the camera only got 3 stars from me, is framing shots. If it is a cloudy day, both the view-finder and the LCD screen darken the image so much that you have no idea what you're shooting. And, it's even worse on a bright sunny day. I hate ""trusting to luck"", but that's what you have to do.If I had it to do over again, I'd opt for a digital SLR. This camera will probably become the ""family"" camera."
5,Everything you could want in a digital camera,"This is a full featured 5 megapixel camera at a decent price. My favorite features are the 12x zoom and image stableization-the movie mode is decent . Although It doesn't bring a battery charger, it takes 4 AA batteries which is very convenient because you can always purchase a pack of batteries on the go. I ordered a charger and a pack of rechargeables for mine."
3,Good camera for ameteurs,"I have been using this camera for about 1 year. Some of the problems with this camera is1) Lens cap doesn't stay on the lens, it always falls down. There is no grip.2) View finder doesn't show the actual picture that the camera will capture. i.e what you see in the view finder is not what you get. The good news is, the picture that is captured is better than what you see in the view finder."
2,I'm crushed - who needs blurry photos,"I recently bought the camera with my grandson's first communion and my neice's wedding coming a week apart. Let me tell you that I had to delete approximately 40% of the photos taken --- reason: blurry/out of focus. I'm experienced with point and shoot digital cameras and I thought the zoom feature would be a great plus for both events. Instead it's been nothing but pure frustation. I even had two of my colleagues who could be classified as amature professional photographers ""play"" with (test)the camera and I guess I should be happy that half of their pictures also came out blurry (so it's not totally ""me""). Bottom line - try to test out the camera before you buy it -- this may not be the camera you're looking for. As for me - my camera is in the mail being returned. The search continues..."
5,Canon Powershot S2IS,"I have owned several digital cameras and this one has to be the best of the lot. I have owned the S2 for several months and during this time it has not failed me. I am amazed by the battery life. Also, the zoom capability coupled with image stabilization, is outstanding. I have taken zoom pictures at night and the results were very usable. The built-in flash has good range."
3,camera,"I bought this as an upgrade/easy use camera for my teenage photographer who's taken several photography classes and been using a camera for several years. It's is a great camera, with lots of options. The pictures are right on par with a higher megapixel camera for a lot less money. You can do alot of different techniques right on the camera instead of doing it when you print. It also has the ""no shake"" feature. However, it is not self-explanatory by any means and anytime something new is tried you must refer often to the user manual. Yes, this is what a manual is for, but after reading through one you don't often have to constantly check back to it as long as you're reasonably intelligent. This one you do. Most teens don't have the patience needed. Some adults don't either."
5,Love It,"I bought this to take to Pee Wee football games, and it does a great job. I get the clarity and action shots pretty close to a professional 35 mm camera! It is bulky and the shutter speed could be faster - but for around $200 you can't beat the pictures it takes."
4,Nice camera,We have enjoyed using this camera. Consistant good results can be had with careful study of the various settings and practice. Love the long zoom.
1,Boring,I was disappointed in this book. It was rather boring and used quite a bit of bad language. I don't care to read any more from this author.
2,Much cornier than I would have expected!,"This was my first MJC book, but having read the reviews, I expected an action-packed exciting book. What I got was a book that dragged on and on. I felt the writing was extremely choppy which was very frustrating (I tend to become a slow reader when the writing is this way... when it is well written, like I am able to fly through a book). I didn't feel the characters were that interesting or exciting... Annabelle, the main character, seemed like a nice sweet working mom, but I really couldn't feel passionate about her because the author just didn't create that for me.And then there's the ending... I really don't think it could have been any cornier... something about someone being allergic to dogs... Someone sneazing near a dog? Oh, please! No offense, but anyone who read and loved this book must never have read a well written, well thought out mystery!"
2,The ending failed...,"This could be a really great suspense novel given the topic and newsroom setting. However, like another reviewer mentioned, there were way too many characters (suspects, of course) to keep up with and almost every page is its own chapter. It feels like a lot of stopping and starting as you read, keeping transitions from being smooth. In addition, which I am starting to see a definite trend when it comes to MJC's novels, she wraps them up way too quickly. There was nothing (no hints, real clues, etc.) to lead the reader to discover the ""bad guy"" on his own. We found out whodunit when MJC gave us an almost laughable clue in the last few pages of the book.For the reader that prefers mystery stories with solid structure, a steady stream of real clues and a sensible, smart ending, I'd go elsewhere for fulfillment."
3,incest in rural West Virginia - not handled well by Cain,"'Butterfly' is the latest of several James M. Cain novels I've read. Unfortunately it seems that beyond his best known works ('The Postman Always Rings Twice', 'Mildred Pierce', 'Double Indemnity') he has pumped out a number of mediocre novels, including 'Butterfly'.'Butterfly' is a novel on incest in a coal mining community in rural West Virginia during the 1930s. No doubt the story was shocking when first written (in 1946) but now the material seems fairly lame. The essence of older man/teenaged girl lust is captured much better in the infamous 'Lolita'. In 'Butterfly' we don't get to really feel smoldering passion or the intense shame associated with incest. While the prose is very readable the characterizations are fairly weak, as one would expect in a novel of little more than 100 pages.Bottom line: James M. Cain on a bad day is still pretty okay, but he has done much better (especially in 'Mildred Pierce')."
4,"""Forest Duet""","I knocked off a star because I never found the 24kt gold stamp. Other than that, though, these earrings are versatile--for casual or formal wear. The picture is close to what I received, but my pair has less substance where the actual leaf is. Put simply, it's not a solid leaf. The electroplating process eats most of the leaf away, leaving only the main veins and the smaller veins that feed into the main ones. The earrings are still quite pretty, though...I wear them often."
2,Nothing new and beneath the surface something very old,"I spent some time with this book and found nothing new in it.You can go back to Capra's books of over 20 years ago and find thesame kind of reductionism as Stephen Gould pointed out in his reviews of the The Turning Point and The Tao of Physics. It's all easy answeres and comes down to the anatomy of the brain. It's not faith its ""hard wiring"" that that counts.There is so much certainty in The authors' belief that he knows God you have to look hard for any sense of humility in the face of the eternal.Other than that the book is interesting and deserves a couple of stars. END"
1,"Faulty advertising! Do not order this ""book.""","Our autographed full length ""How to Know God"" book was stolen from our bookcase. So we ordered this replacement. It does say it is an abridged version. But you have to read the fine print, i.e., the actual stated dimensions of the book, to see that it is really a MINI book, very, very tiny in size and content and essentially useless to us. And also not worth the time and effort to try to return it."

2,How to know Depak Chopra's intentions?,"When I bought and started to read this book I was expecting to find out some new paths in getting closer to GOD but after I have read the first hundred pages I found out that Chopra haswritten more about India/ns and their methods of healing than about GOD.Each one of us is different and as the saying goes ""One man's garbage is another ones treasure"" but my one and only opinion regarding this book is :""This book has a lot of nothing on almost everything and hell noI couldn't waste my precious time on a book like this"". Mind youthe Seven Spiritual Laws book was amazing just as if it was written by someone else! Hoping that mr.Chopra has made a lot of money I would like him to write books that can be read and appreciated by his readers.As I said I am just sharing my opinion so I am sorry if I amoffending someone else's views regarding this book. Thank You."
1,"Nothing new here. Should be titled ""Be your own god""","This is yet another would-be guru reinventing spirituality and presenting it as new. His arguements are verbose, yet without a foundation or logical progression. Rather, he just presents his ideas where he (we) can be our own gods. It's a vacant waste of paper and time."
1,An impersonal god who cares little about you and your life,"I truly cannot understand the appeal of a god that is an impersonal 'force'. For example, in relationship to 'who is god?'..........god is the infinite, unbounded, eternal intelligence that constantly projects itself as the Universe--through the creation of space, time, matter and infinite energy.Listen to that. god is simply the universe. The universe doesn't care about you. The universe is as personal as your shoes.If God exists, He is bigger than that. He is separate from the universe. He is distinct, and He is personal. If there can be any love from God, He has to have a will, emotion, and conscience.Deepak's god is too small. I might as well have a relationship with the impersonal, invisible, and ever-present force of electricity...."
5,Minature pocket size reminders that we can all know GOD,As usual Deepak Chopra has a wonderful way of sharing his wealth of knowledge in a clear and concise format. Short and Sweet - very uplifting.
4,Educational Material.,"BY ""ALBERT C. BENDER"", AUTHOR of ""YOU ARE FOREVER IN TIME""...This book clearly ampliefied for me, this authors knowledge and Intellect on the subject he has written...It provides information that truly moves to the core of the subject matter that the author speaks about...It is well written and thought-provoking throughtout...I recommend this book highly to those who's interest lie within this subject on God...The only exception I see that I wasn't able to extract from this book is this. The author, I believe, and I may be wrong, is that he has God as being seperate from us? I believe GOD is us."
4,A Path to Love,"I am thankful that Deepak has taken the time to share his insights with us. I feel that many of his ideas about intuition and seeking God within, are needed for our survival. More than anything, the book gives faith and hope to the reader that we can move mountains. Deepak's ideas are very useful for daily life and spirtitual development. Tonight, I had difficulty feeding my 10 month old son, only to step outside and see inspiration eight feet from my door...a robin feeding her 6 days old babies. A connection that would have gone unnoticed, prior to my experience with How To Know God."
3,Unnecessarily Complex and Dull,I found the levels a bit contrived. This work didn't take me anywhere new. Deepak just cranking out another source of revenue rather than a real compelling new read with great insights.
2,"""Tao of Physics"" For Dummies ?","I have never read anything by Chopra but was intrigued by his comments regarding the book in a brief TV interview. After reading most of the reviews here, I've decided that Fritjof Capra probably said whatever is in ""How to Know God"" in a much more succinct and convincing manner.Thank you to everyone who reviewed this book; for those who enjoyed it, if you are of a scientific bent you will enjoy ""The Tao of Physics"" as well."
1,A fake!,"This book does not deal with the question of the Divine but with the description of several common images of God - not with God Himself. The style is confusing and confused, repeating over and over a hardly helpful classification of how God can be perceived in the human mind. No help at all to unveil all this (mis-)conceptions of God we human beings carry with us but almost reinforcing them by describing them again and again! Stones instead of bread and disgusting talkative...How is it possible that this man with such a shallow ""teaching"" could become the spiritual guide of so many people in the US and abroad?There are deep, clear and wonderful guides on the journey to unification with the ONE - people who do ""know""!There is no ""knowledge"" in this book."
2,There are better books,"Deepak is looking at God through India glasses, tinted differently than rose-colored perhaps, but definitely different than the God I know and love. There are better books on the market which explore and take God ""out of the box,"" such as Tiffany Snow's ""Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect."" Through Tiffany's glasses (and I know we all wear some version of them) I saw many more facets, rainbow colors and true gems of the nature of God than I did through Chopra, whether you are a Christian or not. I did like Chopra's ""7 Laws"" though, and some of his other works."
1,Cha Ching! for Chopra as he laughs cashing his checks,This book is great for those who love to pursue mindless dribble.... or those who have not had a good bowel movement in a couple of days!
3,It didn't connect with me,as his other books have. I think I have read everything he has ever written. I look forward to his next book.
5,Excellent guide on the many aspects of God,"Well written, beautifully organized in a systemic review of the many (7) levels of understanding God. This is an excellent book for those who wish to understand God beyond any Dogma ! Dr Chopra has done an excellent piece of work."
1,look at small details before purchasing!!,Bought this book new think it was a great price until I received it. It is pocket sized and abridged. Not worth a penny! It was my mistake for not reading the full details. It would cost more for me to return the book than it is worth!
2,Who is the Knower?,"I found the book repetitive in many places. It espoused the point of view that enlightenment was meant only for intellectually brilliant people who could understand every word written by Dr. God. What are the ordinary folks in the world supposed to do? Are their brains wired differently? Are they meant to lead lives without being enlightened? Do they not respond well to enlightened brain farts? To pass off an incorrect commercial interpretation of the Hindu Vedas tells me that the Dr. should study his own scripture in greater detail. Hinduism does not raise only the question ""Who is God?"" but also the more important question ""Who is the Knower?"" Perhaps that will be the title of a sequel. Simple people like me who cannot digest heavy quantum soup find books like ""Conversations with God"" and ""Anita's Legacy"" more enjoyable and less condescending."
4,God is an alien? What the...,"According to Deepak Chopra, No, God is not an alien. He is not even a she, nor is she an it. God is you, the human reading this review. A very enlightening telling of how people are naturally connected to God through brain physiology and the only constant in the known universe: energy. Deepak's theories are brought to life with awe inspiring tales of healing, holiness, and humanity. He creates a bridge that crosses over many religions to find the one truth to which we are all connected. This book is not meant as an instruction guide, but it will hopefully give you the opportunity to create a mental prism which will refract intelligent light in many different directions."
3,Illusion,"I understand this book much better after read Freud's ""The Future of an Illusion"", vice versa.Another joke I just heard from Comedy Channel: ""Look around your world, if God really created this, you know he could have done much better job.""Only unbelievers can truly understand faith. Just like you can only get the full picture of this planet by escaping into the deep space.If God exists, He will not play this seek and hide game; If God creates this world then forgot us, then we have no reason to look for a irresponsible father figure; If God does not exist (in other word, it's nothing but an illusion of us as wish fulfilment), then take a deep breath, try to live a life without Him, it's NOT as bad as it sounds.This book can put your spirit in position, can help you to make peace of anything around you. Though it's said truth can set you free, sometimes lie can do a better job. This explains my 3 star.""Nice try."" God says."
3,TRIM THE FAT,"I found only parts of this book interesting. He tries to encompass too much, trying to explain everything instead of staying focused. It's buddism married to physics, with miracles thrown in. Trouble is he tried to explain away lots of things like healing with hands, and sightings of the Virgin Mary. I found this stuff to be born of an overactive imagination. The spiritual journey to find the ""Self"" was most interesting, but those who are lazy and overweight, need not apply : To find the inner spiritual self, the physical body thus becomes a temple : He neglects to mention, the FIRST things on this journey are proper diet and exercise. If one abuses ones body, how can one get to a higher plane of consciousness ?"
1,does anyone really READ this drivel?,"zFresh from his latest spiritual snake-oil-athon on p.b.s.,Mr. Chopra now takes on ,ah hem,God.If you are an aging yuppie,making well into 6 figures,then here is you man.No sacrifice,no sweat spirituality.If I believed for a moment that Mr. chopra was anything other then a salesman offering his wares to people who want desperately to believe without any fuss,it would be troubling. As it is, it is merely pathetic.There is a plethora of wonderful,meaningful spirituality in print.People like thomas merton,andrew harvey,martin buber,thich nhat hanh henri nouwen,m.r. bawa muhaiyaddeen,a.j. heschel just to barely skim the surface.This,is simply garbage."
3,This book creates limits instead of infinite possibilities.,"Chopra tried to create a step by step process to know God and to rate where you stand as a human being. It is not possible to put God into a category. Therefore, the book limits itself instead of creating infinite possibilities..."
4,JUST A LAY PERSON TRYING TO FIND ANSWERES,"DID I FIND ANSWERS? YES AND I THINK THAT ""HOW TO KNOW GOD"" HAS HELPED ME ON MY PATH... WILL I EVER HAVE THE COMPLETE FEELING THAT I REALLY KNOW GOD? ONLY WHEN I DIE....... BUT FOR A LAY PERSON THIS BOOK IS GOOD NOT GREAT BUT GOOD AND THANKS TO THE AUTHOR FOR MAKING IT EASIER TO KNOW GOD A LITTLE BETTER AND I WILL CONTINUE ON MY PATH........."
1,My mistake,"Did not read the fine print, this book is so small that I will be unable to read it without getting a headache. Total disappointment."
1,"Dull, boring, and nearly made me blind","If I had to depend on this book to help me know God, I would be in big trouble. It started out as a good read, and had some interesting points, but by the time I got to chapter 4, I was so confused and bored. I have never read any of this guys books, but was impressed with him on tv. I think this author is a must to avoid for me. Also, the fine print was so little, I felt like I needed to call my eye doctor."
2,chopra should stick to being a doc..,"I give this book 2 stars for the entertainment it provides coming from someone so full of himself. I am worried that chopra is being regarded by many in the west as one of the leaders regarding Indian spiritualism. If this is the case, it is quite sad, because India has some genuine spiritual giants whose sincerity could never be questioned i.e. ramakrishna, ramana maharshi etc. These individuals words have the ring of truth, and they didn't have a medical clinic on the side charging obscene amounts of money for an 'ayurvedic massage' etc..."
1,Nice try but far away from reality.,"Dr. Chopra tried to show the face of God but I think he tried to combine concepts of different religions and he failed. I like only one thing about this book & i.e. he's inviting world towards God.Being a muslim I know what's ""Night of Qadar"" in Islam. His explanation is way beyond from the concept of many Islamic sects. It seems he's trying to sell his book to all religions so he can fill his pocket.After reading couple of chapters, I could not link with previous chapters and I became bore. Then I left this book away."
1,How Not to Know God,"What readers should ask themselves is, Is this really the true God that Chopra is describing? How does Chopra know it's the real God? What qualifies Chopra to present this as God and as the way to know God? In this book, Chopra basically presents an esoteric gnosticism bathed in layers of fuzzy mysticism. His God ""is in the evil as much as in the good."" He also says that evil and good are swallowed up in God eventually. This means that evil and good are not absolute, are a part of each other and are part of God. This is a type of occult worldview and readers should know what they are imbibing. This is not an absolutely good or perfect God, but a sort of neutral power, the same as what we find in the occult. This book is actually how not to know God, or maybe how to know a counterfeit God."
5,Quite the archaeological tool for the mind and soul.,"This book inables me to see not only the evolvement of our image of God, but my own evolvement through my lifetime. It also is helping me to drudge up some of my old beliefs that still are in my subconscious. It is an excellent book that brings those subtle truths out into full light. It helps me understand how thinking causes us to evolve. If we can't work out what we believe to make sense then we alter that belief slightly and so on and so on. Very interesting. Quite the archaeological tool for the mind and soul."
4,Blown away,"After listening to Keith Jarrett's rendition of ""When I Fall In Love"" I was blown away. It's so beautiful that I promise you will be in love after hearing it!"
2,Not his best work,I too feel that this CD is not the best work that Keith has ever done with his trio.The CD sound is excellent - but the music just isn't that interesting.
3,Not what I had in mind,"Well, this is certainly Jarrett, there's no doubt that this is how he plays (and sings) but I found Inside Out to be a lot less rewarding than anything else I've heard of his. Jarrett's trio's improvisation on themes, particularly in Whisper Not and Tokyo, have been not only tonal, rhythmic and overall extremely high quality music, but they added a certain soul to the original standard. I think that in Inside Out, the trio has lost that unique, ""Jarrett"" touch that made them sound like they sound. As another reviewer said, it's just not interesting. If you're an avid Jarrett fan, I'd listen before I bought Inside Out."
2,Confusing,This book is not well organized and the info is confusing...having it on a Kindle Fire probably makes it worse.
3,Ok Book,"My friend recommended this book to me. I have been looking for some new insight so I thought I would give it a try. Unfortunately I felt like the classifications (nodes) were way off. The introduction made perfect sense to be but as I started to read my node I felt like I was reading about a different person. I'm letting some friends borrow the book to get their opinion. Maybe I'll re-read again later, but for now I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Not very good,Way off what it is advertised to be. Didn't contain any pertinent information about astrology and signs. Jan is good author book is a waste of money
3,Undeniably Valuable Information. However....,"... This book could use a little love.While I found the author's insights on how the nodes can manifest useful - I've studied astrology at an amateur level for many years - I was dismayed by the tone of judgement throughout the text. In addition to revealing life paths and inherent talents, nodes reveal core fundamental and often painful issues which manifest psychologically and materially. While this book does suggest strategies for coping with or shifting a karmic challenge, e.g. affirmations, there was a lot of so-and-so 'needs to re-examine,' 'if [insert node sign here] would just...,' and 'the irony is...'. While thick-skinned readers may find the writing style 'tell it like it is', I found the critical statements somewhat lacking in compassion."
5,excellent service,I received my book purchase from Amazon soooo quickly I was amazed!!!!!The publication contains vital info to life quality improvements.
4,a quick comment,"I find this book very interesting, however it is too bad that there is not more information about mutual reception and opposing sign/house positions of the North nodes."
2,Astrology of what?,"This book is fine if you already have your chart done. You need to know where your South and North Nodes are located . While the book goes into detail, I found most of the traits described did not fit my personality. The book while well written, did nothing for me. It did not hold my attention. I think it is good for a person who wants to learn to read charts for clients-- it would give them plenty to say. However true or untrue."
2,Two Flip Wilson CDs compared,"While this CD has a few good laughs, it falls far short of Flip Wilson's later work. The biggest problem I had with this CD is that it cost twice as much as the other Flip Wilson CD offered by Amazon, ""Flip Wilson: Funny and Live at the Village Gate,"" which is an exact copy of this one. The only difference is that the two CDs have different covers. This is particulary disappointing since Amazon offers both as a package deal, suggesting that they contain different routines."
5,Comedy With Class,"This was a very funny CD. It reflects Flip's brilliance as a comedian and his skillful storytelling ability. Unlike most comedians today who use profanity and insults to get cheap laughs, Flip was one of a kind. CLASS all the way! Normally, once you have heard a comedian's audio recording, you put it away. I have found myself listening to this over and over again. I only wish some of Flip Wilson's albums would become available on CD since many of us do not own turntables. You will find yourself enjoying a ""feel good"" laugh at this CD that everyone can relate to and not the uneasy laughter we are exposed to today with many of the comedians material. BUY IT!"
4,Good Book for Everyone,"I teach a class of 5th and 6th graders. This book was brought to my attention by one of my students. I used it as a read aloud to the class. It was a great Christmas story to send them off to their winter vacation. While there were several Christian references and examples, they were not overbearing to distract from the story's use in a public school. The story was predictible, but it has several lessons including forgiveness, giving to others, kindness, etc. It makes for a good famiy/school tradition."
2,"interesting, but ...","This book is interesting but takes the alleged occultism in Harry Potter far too seriously. There are far greater instances of superstitious ignorance to worry about. I recommed for a balanced and informative examination of the whole Harry Potter phenonemon, Return of the Heroes: The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter and social Conflict, but Hal GP Colebatch"
1,One of Useless and misleading books,"This is another useless and misleading book that is trying to get your money from Harry Potter fever. It tries to convince parents that they need to read this book FIRST to decide whether they should allow their children to read Harry Potter or Load of the Rings. As if none of parents is qualified to teach their kids. I am very sure this book will be forgotten before Harry Potter books. I give one star because I can't give zero or negative 5 stars in the list of ""rate this item"". But I did waste my time to ""read"" this book and I suggest you don't read it."
5,Replay vs Tivo,"Basically both units due the same thing...they record TV programs on to a 20 gigabyte hard disk. The beauty of the systems is that they are a breeze to program, you don't worry about changing or losing videotapes, and you can pause live programming if someone or thing interrupts you, and not miss anything. The Replay was my choice because of the additional input and outputs compared to the Tivo, and the greater cache time (30 minutes versus about 10 hours). What that means is that should you miss part of a program, the Tivo will overwrite that show after 30 minutes of recording versus the Replays 10 hours. The prices are about the same after you pay for the Tivo's lifetime programming charge."
5,"Watching what I want, when I want","An excellent product, what this really does is to allow TV to become more like the Internet or email. Its main function is time displacement - instead of being bound to the schedules that the broadcasters set I can watch much the same programs but when I want to. Minus the ads.I bought it and managed the set up within an hour of fiddling around with wires. It was ready to go and worked intuitively. And, unlike the VCR, everything I've tried to record does so, failsafe. The only limitation is that one can't record two programs showing at the same time - a limitation which presumably future models will correct. But otherwise its worth every cent. Simple, effective, it works. How come I didn't know about this earlier?"
4,Highly Recommended,"Replay TV met nearly every expectation I had, and then some. Very easy to set up - it dials out to get the program guide and you're good to go. My set up includes s-video and stereo cables out to the TV, and s-video and stero cables in from the DVD. I don't have a cable box, but it includes an ""IR blaster"" to control your set-top box. One surprise - you can't record one show while watching another like a VCR. However you CAN watch a previously recorded show while recording another. Also: There is a delay in Replay which causes the image from your DVD to become out of synch with the sound played through your home theater. That being said, imagine watching all your favorite shows whenever you want- sweet."
3,Try others before you buy,"Great concept, lousy implementation. Only interface is a really sub-standard remote. Universal remote code is 075 (AUX)(Shhhh! Don't tell customer service, they claim there is none.) Customer service likes to argue with you and does not fully understand the products capabilities. Currently will not refresh guide automatically, must connect manually once/week. Will not provide info on when this will be fixed. Has icon bug which requires frequent hard boot to fix. Runs extremely hot.Picture is great. Their ad is correct, you have total control over what you watch and when you watch it. Much easier to program than a VCR."
4,Good but A little confusing to set up,The product was a little confusing to set up but after reading the instructions(it helps to read the intructions)I got the system up and running in a fairly complicated setup. The product works great and I recommend the product.
5,Funny movie and excellent soundtrack.,"This soundtrack just rocked. It was a great gothic blend of metal guitars with the violins doing the lead guitar parts and some killer drumming, without getting too out of control. The axe fight scene with the guitar playing off of itself in the trading of shots, is just classic.The movie,while not the best written, still shows me that Kevin Sorbo can act outside of Hercules and pull it off pretty well. :) Besides, who could resist watching Ms. Carerra with orange hair. :)Great stuff. When he rises from the dead before they burn his body...there is a scene where they are all escaping the castle and fighting off everyone... the end of that piece sounds like old George Lynch from Dokken. Often made me wonder. :)"
5,ghs pedal steel guitar strings,"ghs is a world class leader in pedal steel guitar strings. They even make steel guitar strings for alot of manufacturers such as cobra coil, jagwire, and several others."
2,"Overall, a disappointment","With the exception of the Donna D'Errico segment, not worth it. If you're looking for any of these particular women, I would recommend trying another title. Most, if not all, are on several. The Carmen Electra bit is the low point, a total waste of disk space."
2,Not so hot.,"What they have done for each ""celebrity"" is they start out with a bunch of still shots for around 20 seconds, and then they flash to a vignette lasting around 5-6 minutes. There is only one per girl.My main problem is not their format, but the fact they had several better looking celebrities they have either made/photographed that were ignored (like Kelly Monaco) in place are ones like Jessica Hahn (who is famous only for sleeping with the now defunct ptl club chief Jim Baker <I think thats his name its been years>). Monaco would have been an excellent looking girl instead of (compared to some of the others) a rather plain to above average Hahn and the positively stupid vignette they shot her in. Not enough five star caliber girls/celebrities (that playboy HAS in their vault) for the price. Pam Andersons vignette was lame too, almost as bad as her feature DVD."
3,a good start,"bof. i was i little bit disapointed by this. if you already have the tapes of pamela anderson or babes of baywatch this is only a retrospective. nothing new. if you are a brand new customers of the playboy's videos, thant this is a good start (altought already old)."
4,Obscured gem in the romantic german prog scene but...,"Well I don't wanna give to this important work the maximum rate, as for a certain lack of inspiration in some melodic passages, expecially in those ones concerning the colors of the female voice, which is a bit monotonous in some passages...besides I expect more and more dynamic scales and armonic completeness from two composers keyboardists ""coupled"" together!! But the influence on some following light romantic symphonic works is evident; otherwise in some dark space passages they remain very well aligned to the best space rock german tradition, even if they are more ""early Genesis"" oriented. It's not a masterpiece, but a classic anyway;moreover it can well complete your collection of classic prog."
4,Interesting Movie in a Not-So-Interesting Genre,"Though this movie has a lackluster plot (the usual soft-core fare), the cinematography is absolutely fantastic. The acting is fairly decent, and the locales are beautiful. This is a very interesting movie; one can show it to fellow movie buffs and impress them, because it comes across as an avant-garde European film."
3,It's ok,"Deadliest Warrior is pretty good, however they don't take into account how some units fought/fight. For example they spartans fought as units not one lone spartan."
5,Deadliest Warrior - Apaches,Buy it now! You won't be disappointed in Season One. You learn some martial history and learn a little more about the weapons of that period.
3,i'll watch it if its on but wouldnt buy it,"yes as a guy, ive seen many shows from this series but it can be annoying. it shouldnt be called deadliest warrior but dealiest weapons. the show is about which groups' weapons can do the most damage to a balistic gel dummy. some guy who represents a dead culture hits the dummy with a club and beheads it then the doctor comes over and says ""well, beheading would kill a guy"" then everyone goes ""well that proves this club would behead a human"". next the computer guy plugs it into a computer which ""proves"" who the winner is (although things like training, tactics, etc don't figure in... just how much windup the green beret or wrestler who represents a spartan (for example) can achieve. so, fun to watch for awhile but repetative."
5,ninja samurai,"This is a must buy for fans of DW, and even people who have never seen it. My friend came over the other day, never heard of the show and was imedietly interested in the show. Toltaly worth the 20 or so bucks!!!"
2,Silly,"Full of historical inaccuracies, trash talk and myths. Uber elite equipped Samurai warrior vs slightly above average equipped Viking?Just for fun? Maybe, but it ceases being funny when half the show is spent recapping after station breaks for everyone who missed everything before that break and/or trying to ""prove"" how expert their methodology is supposed to be. Give it up.Well, there are a few fun moments if you like to watch what happens when you use a weapon against a defenseless opponent.Best scientific fact? That using a cestus vs. bare fist gives almost triple the punching force."
3,dedliest waira baby!,"every fight in here is cool, fun, and unusual. a good time,but it quickly gets boring with all of the tests like, let me see the freaken fight. it was pretty good"
4,Keats audio,The selection of poems is good. It would have been nice if the reader would have identified the title of the poem he was reading. The reading was a bit over the top at times.
4,Iron Jawed Angels,"This book is great. It is better than the movie. It made me, as a woman, understand what all the fuss was about and how hard these woman worked to get what they wanted. I really admire these women for what they stood for and for going through all of this for all the women everywhere. Thanks ladies."
3,Doesn't Fit,I purchased these lights for a smaller lamp. Diameter is to big and I need to return them. Other wise these lights are great.
3,Not as long lasting as advertised,"The information on the box for this product advertizes thousands of hours for this lamp, but we only get about 2 mos of life. Still, it is a sturdy, splash-proof lamp and our turtle really likes it in the cooler months."
2,Disappointed in selection of material,"While I greatly respect and appreciate the intent behind this collection, I couldn't help but be disappointed by many of the choices. Most of these scores have wonderful songs, but in many cases those selected for this CD are not the strongest or most representative. The selections from ""Das Barbecu"" and ""john and jen"" in particular, while nice enough, are by no means the highlights of those respective shows. Also, as simply a matter of opinion, it would have been nice had the show contained a selection or two from ""When Pigs Fly"", a delightful recent Off-Broadway show. I would recommend the recordings of any of the shows mentioned above over this somewhat tepid collection."
1,Turgid and dull,"This is the only one of Zelazny's books I have not found brilliant. I just could not get going with it, it seems to be an attempt to recall the work of Edgar Allan Poe. The action seems slow and Victorian. I have read good Victorian era stuff but this ain't it."
5,"A sweet, light, sunny place","Sweet music is the best summary of this artist's work for me. From the Bohemia track to Shape of Love, the music lifts you spiritually to a light, soft, secure place where sunlight, warm breezes and happiness seem everpresent. Mae Moore's ability to instill the quintisential emotions of love and peace in this music is, to me, profound. Mae Moore's next best disc, in my estimation, is Dragonfly, with a similar light and sunny disposition which is likewise sure to sooth and calm. Another artist which reaches me in a similar way is Sarah MacLaughlin, though the emotion in Sarah's music brings sadness, reflection and philosophical musings. Mae Moore's Bohemia, like Ayn Rands, Fountainhead will be lifelong favorites and presents from me to those whom I think will enjoy the places they travel."
5,Excellent accounts of the new medical uses of hypnosis.,This new book was written for medical students and other interested persons. It contains up-to-date accounts of how hypnosis is applied to a variety of medical and psychological problems. It is highly recommended!
5,The greatest British garage punk album of the past 20 years,"Over the years, the prolific Billy Childish (singer, songwriter, artist, author) has put out hundreds of LPs, CDs, 7"" singles, books and more. In the 1980s, Childish was moving from the cleaner, classic 60s pop-garage sound of The Milkshakes to something more sinister, and thus was born Thee Mighty Caesars. Think the Clash meets Link Wray.Thirty-three tracks of supercharged yet catchy punk & garage madness, all sung with a cockney accent. Check out the covers of The Clash's ""Career Opportunities"" and the Ramones' ""Beat on the Brat.""The Milkshakes, Thee Mighty Caesars and Thee Headcoats are the most common bands you'll find under Mr. Childish's underground media empire. Put your headcoats on and check them all out!"
3,predictable,There is nothing groundbreaking or unique about Billy Childish and his mates in this album. If you like punk it's a good buy but nothing more.
3,To Catch A Killer,"I saw this film when it first came out on television. The film listed on this website is not the complete film. It has been cut from it's original version and format. To Catch A killer was just recienly on the Lifetime channel, and it is spli into to parts. This film is at least almost 4 hours long, and not 95 minutes. Anyone wanted to get this great film starring Brian Dennehey should try to search for the original un-cut version. To Catch A Killer is an intense, and horrifying depiction of the infamous killer (John Wayne Gasey), and the hard working dedicated detectives who built a case and to put this man away in prision where he needed to be.I have the 95 minute VHS tape, but you are missing some of it's most griping moments in the 4 hour version, that any film collecter should want to own."
3,This movie needed more about Gacy and less about the cops!,"I know this is based on the cop's perspective of things, but Brian Dennehy (as Gacy) was only in this movie 40% of the time! And only 5% of that showed what the guy was actually about and what motivated the police in the first place!! Instead of giving a gritty, real life portrayal of what a serial killer did (in order to invoke sympathy for the victims and strong repulsion of the character) we are treated to long, boring scenes of investigative ho-hum and the top cop's family life (??!!) I walked away thinking that Gacy was silly rather than evil, and something tells me that wasn't that wasn't the moviemakers' goal..."
3,Not Enough Music,"This CD is too short. The movie contained some wonderful music, but only 36 minutes of it are found here. Even though I liked the selections on the CD (excluding the Zoe Poledouris song at the end), there was too much music missing for it to be anything other than disappointing. ANY movie soundtrack CD that is less than 60 minutes long is a ripoff."
1,All orchestra music....,This CD is short with only the orchestra music.... there is one track at the end that has vocals on it... not worth the money or the time. Do not buy.
1,Fairly disappointing,"The Zoe Poledouris song at the graduation dance is called ""I have not been to Oxford Town"" and was originally released by David Bowie (You can find it on his 1995 'Outside' album). I wish too that they had released it on the soundtrack. I don't think she has released it at all, but I know it would be a chart-buster if it ever got out."
5,pretty damn fun!,"This is just a killer soundtrack. I drive alot, and I used to listen to it every day, until my car got broken into and the stole my cd player, and cd's. I haven't been able to find it until now. Thank you fro letting me get back to normal driving. I don't drive to much else."
3,Perfect for Plantar Sufferers,"I suffer from Plantar Fascitis and these are great for around the house...UNTIL the little pegs in the bottom start breaking loose as they always seem to do, and way too early. I won't buy again. I would if there was a way to keep the little pegs attached to the sole of the shoe."
3,almost...there,"It's hard to replace what really works, but this comes close. I bought something similar years ago and it's really falling apart now. It's hard to find my size and to find a pair that doesn't irritate the spurs in my heels. I found this pair and it comes close. My old pair doesn't aggrevate them. My old pair works better for me, but since they are falling apart this is the closest replacement that I've been able to find.adidas Women's Adissage W Sandal"
4,Good.,"Received within 2 days which made me sooooo happy. However, I was sort of disappointed when I put them on, it was really hard, and I thought it would of been more soft, because it looks like little massaging balls, but it's still really cute and a great buy."
2,Expected them to be better,"I got these for my wife since she always complains of leg aches. Saw the sharp edges to massage feet and thought it would be good. My wife did not really like them but is putting up with it - ""something is better than nothing""I tried them and felt the same - not a great way to soothe your aching legs.I would not recommend this to others - for the price you pay it's not a good buy."
3,Rough,Size runs true but a little rough on the feet. Definitely a sandal that requires socks which is kind of a shame when my feet need air. Other than that very comfy.
1,THESE SANDALS SUCK !!!!!,Two weeks after I purchased them the little pink message things started falling out and they were all over my floor. Now the sandals are useless.
1,Poor Quality; Poor customer service,"I bought these shoes and liked the feel. However, within a month, many of the nubs broke off. I contacted Adidas for a return pair . They don't reimburse for return postage. No one from Adidas ever responded. Don't waste your money on these; buy another brand, or expect to find that they will deteriorate in short order."
2,Pretty but uncomfortable,"Okay, so I love pink stuff, and these are pink, but the little bumpies on the in-soles hurt the bottom of my feet after a while. If I wear them with socks, then it doesn't hurt. Also they run really big. I am a 7-1/2 to 8, but I am able to fit into size 6-7 of these shoes. Interesting. I say: not worth it if you want comfortable sandals."
5,Love Them!!!,I am a woman who wears them even though they are mens and I love them. I live in them from about april through late september (in New England). They are the most comfortable shoes and last a long time.
5,Love it,My daughter wore these sandals literally all summer. She said they are super comfortable. Great product for a sporty girl.
4,Nik massage sandals,I really love these sandals as you walk they massage the bottom of your feet I think they are well made and I wd definitely recommend them
3,Order 1 size Bigger,I do like these sandals but I wish I would have known to order one size bigger than I wear in all other shoes!!! But over all if they were not too small I would say shoes are GREAT!
5,Wonderful as ever,"I had a pair of these in high school.. All these years later, I am deployed to Afghanistan and in boots all day all the time, i wanted something that I could slip my feet into for comfort. Thay are awesome, and inexpensive. Nothing like a little slice of home when your so far away. :)"
4,"nice, comfy shoe for wide feet","Wanting something to slip on when I have to take the trash out, or go outside for the mail, or water garden, I wanted a sturdy shoe that can get dirty and clean easily. These fit that bill. They are also a prime choice for my ""utilitarian"" [read:wide] feet. The foot bed has the nubs, which are a little odd on the bottom on my feet, but I find if I wear a pair of socks with these, then the nubs are quite cozy. Without the socks, the nubs feel good in some places and too much in other parts of my feet."
2,Horrible Translation,"Comparing these translations to other versions, these translations are horrible. With Kafka, even just one word can change the entire meaning of his work. I would recommend Malcolm Pasley's translations of Kafka instead."
5,A Good Buy,I got this to replace a canister vacuum cleaner that was very heavy and had a filter that was difficult to clean. This vac is light weight on stairs and very easy to use. It has good suction and power brush for rug and works well on the floor settings without any attachments. It has a long cord and a light to tell you when the bag is full. I like to vacuum often and the Sanitaire is very convenient and efficient-- amazing for the price.
3,Expected Better,"I had read great reviews of this product and was sadly disappointed because it doesn't suck up the animal hair as well as I thought it would. However, the suction on the attachment is awesome."
4,Good little vacuum,"We bought this thinking it was a ""regular"" size vacuum but to our surprise when it came it was a ""lightweight"". We really like it. It only has two settings, floor or carpet but it works wonderfully. I like it so much better than the last two vacuums that we paid way more money for that ended up crapping out on us. Very lightweight and I love the bag system. It is much less maintenance than the bagless."
5,Powerful and lightweight,"Couldn't ask for more (except for a cordless to work this well, but at this point I don't think that's ever going to happen.) This little guy is as powerful as my full-sized vacuum, and it is so much easier to use. Not just because of the small size, but all the attachments (except the longer hose extension, which I don't use anyway) fit right on the vacuum. Also, I don't have to attach the hose: it is ready to go any time.In an ideal world, a bagless and cordless vac would be this powerful, but I don't think that's realistic. I'm sticking with what works!! I'm very happy with the cleaning by this guy, and after you change the bag, the suction is brand new again. Top handle folds down and fits in a tiny space. Also, the cord length is great, and I only have to change the plug once to do our whole 3-bedroom ranch. Great buy."
2,Jazz History book,"The only complaint I had was the condition of the book. It was labeled as in ""Good"" condition but there was writing all over the spine and in the pages, and the book was thoroughly worn. Other than that, I'm happy with it!"
1,FORCED TO BUY FOR JAZZ HISTORY,"This was required for my jazz history class at Sacramento City College (MUFHL 315 - online). It was 125.00 at the college book (packaged along with some worthless CD's). It is not laid out like a normal textbook. At the beginning, it doesn't have a chapter outline or learning objectives. At the end of each chapter, all you have is a sorry summery that doesn't cover any of what the author is trying to say within the chapter. THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER BEEN FORCED TO BUY FOR A CLASS. I am tired people publishing the results of their graduate work as TEXTBOOKS and ripping off poor undeserving student. Reading this book is like watching paint dry."
4,love it!,"Really great! Need this book for my class and studying for the tests are easy, and if course I'm a big fan of jazz :)"
2,Jazz Styles History and Analysis 10th Edition,"Amazon advertises this book in their editorial review as having ""accompanying cd's"". I did not get with my book and they dropped the book price by $5.00 this week. Now I have to track down just the cd's that are suppose to be included as advertised!!!!"
2,"Doesn't hurt, doesn't help...","I gave it 2 stars because it doesn't hurt, doesn't give you weird reactions or allergies, which is always good, but it doesn't really help either, I didn't feel any difference taking it, after it I still got sick several times, I finally found another product that help me better with my immunological system but I guess I shouldn't write it in another product review..."
2,mediocrity from mogwai,"I don't see how people can rant and rave so much about this album, although I do like mogwai I find that most of their albums are fairly inconsistent. Meaning there are usually about two or three really powerful songs and the rest could of been left off. This is definetly what it's like with this album, or 'singles' collection or whatever you want to call it. ""Summer"", ""Ithica 27/9"" and ""Helicon 1"" are all excellent tracks, and that's about it, the rest is pretty much filler. Whenever I put the CD in the player I found myself always skipping tracks to get to those three tracks mentioned. If you can justify buying this for those songs then go for it, but if you want an album that is gonna blow you away song by song, look elsewhere."
5,is it weird that this is one of my favorite mogwai releases?,"I know, I know. I should like Young Team. I should like Come On Die Young. But I can't help but feel that some of Mogwai's best material is on this disc. The beautiful ""Summer"", the powerful ""Ithica"", and of course the classic ""Helicon 1"" are all brilliant pieces of mogwai's catalogue. Don't be hatin' this disc - I purchased this mid-way through my mogwai listening career and was not dissapointed at all."
3,Poised for greatness,"2 1/2 starsEven before an official debut, these young lads from scotland were already proving their relationship with music far exceeded their peers..Yes this is probally the least amazing of Mogwai's catalouge, but within the subtlties you see the ingrediants that would help make Mogwai one of the standout bands of the new millenium..This album has more breezy, relaxed tracks then what we are used to dealing with when plunging into the abyss with these guys, however the essence of the band and it's die hard philosphy of letting a composition breath as long as it needs to is in full effect. Amazing that a band so young could be so sincere in it's goal of pure audio immersion."
2,Eh,This book was kind of cheesy. I thought it would be more about a woman's funny/bad dating experiences instead of some book I have to flip through to get to any story.. It's good for the first 5 minutes.
3,A better choice for Choose your Own Adventure,"This is a fun book suitable for pre-teens and teen girls. There are chances to make some bad decisions that don't always give a harsh enough outcome (i.e. having unprotected sex with a stranger results in marriage and a baby), but in general this book was fun and when the reader makes a really bad call at one point (yes, I read through all of the endings), the author slightly chastizes the poor choice (which I found amusing and light hearted). This book does not encourage multiple dates in one night, but instead gives options of whether you want to go on a date that night, if so, what happens, and there are lots of twists and turns that make this book fun even for a pre-teen/teen who is not an avid reader. The stories are fairly short and could be read with limited time."
3,Hilarious,"This book is definitely good for a laugh. Each plotline ends with a different crazy twist. However, I hope this book doesn't represent how women actually think, or I'm going full gay."
3,"Not well written, but a lot of fun","The author has great ideas and the premise behind this book has so much potential as a Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA). (I do not want to give away many of the endings, but a roommate from hell reading bad poetry is just one potential outcome.) However, it is not well drafted and the illustrations are unnecessary and distracting. I wish the author of this book would do a piece with the authors of Whatever you want - now that would be a fantastic CYOA ride."
5,Farrier recommended!,"I am a professional, certified farrier and I love this product for my client's hooves after I've just trimmed and rasped them. Rasping opens up the outer layer of the hoof exposing the tubules beneath and I like that this product is both anti-fungal and anti-bacterial. It's like using anti-bacterial hand soap on yourself except this also offers the added moisturizing properties for dry or brittle hooves. This product is a semi-solid (hooflex also has a liquid form). This one can be applied by hand, with a stiff brush, or heated up and painted on more like a liquid. If you are looking for something easier to work with then get the liquid version, but for the quantity I use I like being able to buy the larger size which only comes in the semi-solid."
3,3 Stars Is Generous,"Unless, you have time to set up a board and mimic the countless moves, or you have an out standing memory, this book is hard to follw. The parts that I am able to read is pretty good good ideas, but mostly massive chess notation. It says 900 diagrams but with each one is 50 moves to get to the postion and 50 after the picture to get the logic of the position. I guess if you are a master it would make sense. Defininatly not for beginers or even intermediate players I would say."
2,Classic case of the emperor's new clothes,"I am mystified why anyone thinks this book is ""comprehensive"" let alone good. If you are a novice player-stay away, this book is awash is jargon and silly hyperbole that I assume is understood by advanced players. This book assumes you know the names of most of the games and gambits. Thus, you need to read other books on chess just to understand what Burgess is talking about."
1,Certainly not a book for learning about XML schemas,"Certainly not a book for learning about XML schemas, may be used as a reference. Very theoretical, particularly the first few chapters, and strikingly similar to W3 recommendations. If you are just starting with XML schemas, pick a different book."
5,Refreshing and humorous gay short stories about young guys,"We enjoyed the short films a lot. They are unusually high quality creations and we hope there will be many more of this kind. Although they don't forget the serious aspects of the process of coming out of younger men, the stort films are created with a message of humor and optimisnm which makes the viewer feel refreshed after viewing. This is the kind of films I wished I could have seen as a teenager."
3,First love,Not a very shocking film .Expected more action as it must get for all that I'd heard about couples falling in love.No strong arm action.
2,Did any of these reviewers actually SEE the movie?,"I enjoyed the second and first story more than the last. The only thing I didn't like about this film (and all gay cinema), is the fear to portray intimacy on the screen. Had this been a heterosexual film, the couples would have been butt naked and bumpin' within the first ten minutes. It took almost half an hour for one kiss! Now I'm not saying that I want to see hardcore anything, but I would like to see the two actually together without fear from the critics. Other than that I thought it was nice, the acting was kind of cheesy but who can blame them? I actually give it like 4 stars but if I did would you read my review?"
4,The Disco Years is a Winner,"I couldn't get into the first two shorts here, finding the lead protagonists either boring and uninspired (Pool Days) or just plain weird (A Friend of Dorothy). But I was very impressed with the third short, The Disco Years. The film is simple and direct in its depiction of the trials and traumas of a teenager coming to terms with his sexuality, and hats of to Matt Nolan, who plays the lead protagonist Tom. He turns in such a sweet and emotionally honest performance, its hard not to be moved by him, and his experience."
2,"cute, but not as good as expected","What a waste of money!!! Whatever you do, don't buy this puppy! I paid almost 40.00 for this dog. All it does is barks, wags his tail,kicks his hind leg and gives kisses. This dog is the worst!! It does not sound ANYTHING like a real puppy. And even though I had put water in it, the kisses were just a little wet!Thanks for reading, have a great day!"
2,Too general,"I wouold only skim this book if you want a general idea about business marketing, but do not expect in depth detail about how to truly market your business."
3,a real surprise,interesting but not what I expected...a complete surprise re: subject matter but held my interest and offered subjects for further investigation.
3,No Pictures!! :(,"There seems to be something wrong, as there clearly should be pictures, but for some reason they are not showing up on my Kindle! Otherwise it seems to be very informative..."
2,Slightly misleading Title.,"This book is about monsters only in the sense that on their scale spiders and some carniverous insects are horrifically effective predators. From the portions I've read so far, this is a text about spiders and insects which feed on other such creatures. I believe the illustrations (which are missing from the book) consisted of close up pictures of the arachnids and insects--who definitely look monsterous when looked at close up and without something to show the size of the ""monsters."""
4,Wanka's we're not!!! Long live Scotland,"This album is guaranteed to rock your silly little world. If you're expecting some pretty Scot pop a la Belle & Sebastian, move on. This here is rock n roll. Imagine the Lochness monster invading your living room- this is Prolapse. They will get into your head and shake you up. A good reference point might be louder Mogwai with a bit of vocals. Nothing else compares to this stuff. Turn this up real loud and throw on a kilt."
3,So-so,"This novel was not up to what I expect of Rosamunde Pilcher in terms of quality. Also, it was not well-packaged."
3,not her best book....,"I love Pilcher's books but this one is not as good as SEPTEMBER, UNDER GENINI, THE SHELL SEAKERS or COMING HOME. Yes, the vividness is there, the story is well written and the characters difficult to forget, but she can do a lot better, she has proven it to us, her fans!!!"
2,Saddly disappointed,"I don~t know if this is Rosamund Pilcher~s first book or what, but I have to say that I was disappointed by it.I picked it up at the library and when I opened the first page sitting in my favorite chair in my living room I was filled with anticipation...thinking I would have the same experience with this particular Pilcher book that I have had with all the others that I~ve read. Ahh, not to be. I found all of the characters lacking in development, whiny, and just not likable at all, with the exception of Charlotte. The description of the Cornish countryside wasn~t up to par with The Empty House and Coming Home, though nothing can ever compare to Coming Home. I had a hard time visualizing Phoebes house and her garden. I didn~t even get a full picture of Lily Tonkins. To be honest, I didn~t even like the characters names.If you have never read a Pilcher book before, do not start with this one. If you do, I think you may never want to read another."
2,I found my house in Cornwall!,"This early, brief Pilcher story is more interesting than the others for a couple of reasons. The setting in Cornwall has become my dream Cornwall location. The manor house inComing Homeis too grand, the houses inThe Empty Housenot quite me either. Phoebe's house Holly Cottage is just right - welcoming, casual, delightfully sited. Yes the heroine is nineteen and falls for an older man, but the story is told in the first person, which gives it a freshness thatThe End Of Summerdoesn't have.There's a little social intrigue, some advance and retreat between the narrator and her love object, but a happy ending for all.As long as you don't have an issue with the age gap between the couple, this is an enjoyable quick read for Pilcher fans, Anglophiles, and romance readers in general."
3,GO BABY GO GO (3.5 stars),"Some of the raunchiest, sleaziest, most glouriously outdated rock 'n' roll you'll ever hear. Back in the days when striptease left something to the imagination, strip clubs would often come with a band. They would blast out sleazy jazz or rock 'n' roll. The cover basically shows you what is inside this disc. Perfect music from roaming the streets reeking of hard liqour. This music just reeks of sleaze and bands who wouldn't be found playing outside strip clubs. It's remarkable that they even recorded, let alone these 45s survived up to this day. Like most music of it's type, its sexy but never really sexual. Just a girl in sexy lingerae, nothing more, nothing less. If you like David Rose's ""The Stripper"", and are wondering where to go from there, this is a good comp to pick up."
1,Terrible Recording Quality,"You can hear lots of scratches from the original records, sound is very tinny -- all treble and no bass. Playing this CD on my multi-kilo-buck sound system sounds worse than my 1950's car radio used to sound."
1,No Contents,The description states that the collection has a table of contents but no such table exists- making it difficult to navigate these works.
4,voltaire,"Tis, homers humble opinion that philosophy, Is the greatest thing in the world. It provides us with food for the mind, we can gain nourishment from it for life. And with an abundance of philosophers to pick from we are left with numerous options. Voltaire, is one of those uniquely gifted philosophers we owe it to ourselves, to read."
4,Watch It,"It's definitely worth watching. The ending was so unexpected, just when you think you have the film all figured out, it shocks you right to the very end."
3,"Good plot & acting, but dark","A fine flick for watching the talented Miss Berry, and the story has some good twists & turns. Bruce Willis does an interesting turn as the lecherous boss, though he seemed under-utilized. Clearly it was Halle's movie. Mr. Ribisi also found an interesting character, not your typical computer nerd. However, the plot was so dark and sordid, I felt I had to take a shower afterwards. I wouldn't recommend it to the tenderhearted."
1,God awful,"It was only 99 cents so I figured, how bad could it be? That was my first mistake. My second was thinking it might get any better. It did not.It was AWFUL. The story is weak, murky and completely contrived. You never care about ANY of the characters. Not one. The story flounders and flails painfully until the bitter (STUPID) end.Bruce Willis should NEVER have agreed to be in this movie. Based on this performance, Halle Berry needs to give her Oscar back ASAP.Wait til it is on cable or go read a review of it online. This movie was TERRIBLE."
2,Imperfect,"Ro (Halle Berry) is an undercover reporter looking for the murderer of her 'friend,' Grace (Nicki Aycox). I use the word friend lightly here since Ro and Grace had a falling out just before when Grace stole Ro's boyfriend.But, when Grace is found murdered and a mysterious advertising mogul, Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), is the prime suspect she goes under cover to get the killer.Add Miles (Giovanni Ribisi) as Ro's computer geek/skeevy assistant and you should have an interesting mix.The pace could have sped up a bit. They could have found at least one likable character. The best thing about the film is the music--some good stuff there, and a very twisty ending. (Unfortunately, I foresaw it)Rebecca Kyle, December 2008"
1,Waste of time,"I cannot believe this is a movie. It really disgusted me and it just plain perverse. Halle Berry and Bruce Willis have shamed the art of cinema. The casting is a weak spot and a real problem. The acting just plain ridiculous, the performances were tired and forced. The story is intricate and well thought out but really what is the point. So many clues are forced on you and you can't really understand how a movie with two A-list actors could be this bad. Miles the so called ""Hero"" so to speak is just as sleazy and deranged as the other characters. None of the characters were liked because they were bland and too stupid to really get attached to them. Please, please, don't watch this idiotic movie it is just plain bad."
2,What the ????,"I was really enjoying this movie until the end, when everything was beginning to unfold. Let just say the end was sooo stupid, it ruined the whole movie (whoever came up with such a Bad ending should be fired!)"
2,What was the point of this movie?,"I don't even know where to begin. My brother suggested I watch this movie as he said it was really good. I found myself bored for the first half hour. Just when I thought things were finally starting to pickup I was let down. This movie was all over the place and made no sense whatsoever. WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE POINT??? There were several unnecessary scenes that added no value at all, and some scenes the writers could have elaborated on. There was a twist at the end but that confused me even further. This movie is not worth the money or the time. At the end of the movie, as the credits rolled, I was sitting there clueless ... scratching my head ... looking at my brother ... and wondering, ""so, this is what you call a really good movie?"""
