5,Great imaginative adventure for any Babysitter,"I saw this movie a while ago and enjoyed it, as my daughter was a babysitter and I could so picture something funny as this could happen to her. Great movie for kids and if you are an adult you can enjoy it as a cute adventure, think when you were younger, could you picture this happening to you."
3,Fun 80's movie,"I'd remember loving this movie as a kid and thought I'd buy it for my own children. Although we all enjoyed the premise and story line, we all cringed at the amount of bad language throughout the movie. There is quite a bit of swearing throughout the movie and the playboy magazine was a little uncomfortable but overall it's a fun, silly movie and fun to see an 80's movie still survive."
4,Cheesy but good! :),"This movie is old, but its funny. Totally cheesy like most old movies, but still has its funny moments. Makes u think twice about babysitting....hehe."
3,A Night on the Town????,"If someone could tell me why some movies have two titles,that would be great......./Anyway//Liz Shue plays a 17 year old babysitter who is stuck babysitting 3 brats(2 are teens)after her conceited boyfriend stands her up for the school hussy.That's NOT where the hardships end.A trip into the city to rescue her best friend who has run away from home and is stuck at an airport with a mob of wackos(including a bald chinese lady with no pants on and a man waving a gun around and grinning)leads to one mishap and dangerous adventure after another.Will they ever make it home b4 the kids parents get home???It is pretty funny,especially Daryl,a smart-mouth who laughs like a deranged loony at everything.When I was 15,this movie actually made me WANT to get stuck in the city with those kinds of scary adventures,which means I'm sorta weird I guess."
4,loved it as a kid...,"but the more i watch it as an adult, i haven't liked it as much. maybe i just watched it too often. it still is a good family film, recommended for everyone."
4,very good movie,back in 1992 i first saw this movie and since then i loved just a big eighties freak when i watch this movie it brings back good memories i was 10 years old in 1987 penelope ann miller very good actress she did a good role elisebeth shue very good also boy the eighties were so different wish we could go back like the part when they get in the car with the robber so funny
4,Adventures in Babysitting,The shipping was very timely and we really enjoyed watching the movie. The Price was also very good
5,"good product, good service","Product was exactly as described & was shipped in a timely fashion. Excellent service, in my opinion."
2,go to walgreens,Lasted 3 pages// seller sent new cartridge. Leaked and did not last long.Tale your empty to Walgreen for a quality refill.
1,"No, just no","This band does not deserve a greatest hits album after 3. Especially when only two of them are good. A Death Grip on Yesterday had me screaming at my cd player. Their emo crap made me cringe. It was clear the record label pushed them in a certain direction just because their drummer has an amazing singing voice.When I saw them live in 05' they were touring off The Curse, excellent energy and they played with a great metal band with the likes of Unearth. Suicide Notes is one of the best metal albums by a very young band at the time (see Poison the Well's Opposite of December). It makes me sad the direction they went in. Unfortunately, after reading a brief review, I'm sure their new album sucks too.If you want to listen to metal, get Parkway Drive, Unearth, In Flames, Lamb of God, Himsa, Shattered Realm, August Burns Red, or the new Megadeth album. Those are kickass, Atreyu sucks."
1,"I love Atreyu ,but honestly.","Okay first off atreyu is awesome, i love the band. Seriously though, a best off. They have 3 albums and and ep out. Now the music on here is good but it's missing a few tracks. For instance Rememberance Ballad, Shameful, and My fork in the road(your knife in my back). This is clearly a Victory records idea to get as much money from the Atreyu brand while they can. and what better way than exploiting the catalogue of songs then a best of album."
1,why???,ok.. i love atreyu. seriously.. i have an atreyu tattoo.. but there is NO NEED for a GH album already.. seems like they just want some quick cash. the album cover sucks.. and this really just isnt neccessary!
1,Victory loves your money.,"EDIT: Okay, after being informed that this is what they released to END their record contract, I can say it's a lousy move at that. But then again, some artists release awful albums in an attempt of this. A Perfect Circle had at least a relevant purpose forEmotive, even though that was a badMer de Noms. Lou Reed made an actual challenging album in the infamousMetal Machine Music. NIN actually did one by making good music. Atreyu? They actually DID sell out for their move! Hopefully this goes out of print, because the band should at least realize in a few years how worthless this collection is.The band decided to leave the record label, probably a good decision of the band anyway, they feel the need to do this. They already had a re-release ofThe Curse, and this is even worse. I'm so glad they didn't do this to Thursday when they signed to Island. Don't let the record label fool you in to buying these marketing ploys."
1,These guys are a joke....,"You know Destructions Thrash ANthems just came out too, buy that and see where real metal came from."
5,Great CD for new fans,"I was familiar with Atreyu. I had heard a few of thier songs, but I have never purchased any of thier music. This is a great CD for someone who does not own any of Atreyu's CDs. It has a lot of thier better songs, all on one CD. This CD is not for true Atreyu fans that already own all of thier CDs. I have seen a lot of Atreyu fans bash this CD. Well of course, there are not any new songs on the CD, the only thing it adds is a DVD. The CD itself is great. I love every song on this CD. They have a great sound, and the vocals are amazing. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes hard rock."
3,Blame Victory records for the ablum,"Ok, so it is not an ""original"" album, like everyone else said, more of the old. Good for people just getting into the band, but pointless if you have the cds, just make a burned copy of the songs in the same order and there you have it. go to youtube if you want to see the videos, great band so i couldnt give less then 3 stars"
5,Greatly informative & highly recommended!,"Human beings are very complex individuals -- we are all driven to make a place in the world, yet we have different means to achieve this place...different behaviors that allow us to ""survive.""In the book, ""The Tending Instinct,"" the author shows how men and women differ in their responses in times of need. According to the author, women are born with a ""nurturing"" quality and tend to seek support from others during times of stress. During these times, women will also reach out to help others. This natural ""tending instinct"" that women have, is vital in a society and also beneficial to children who are exposed to this instinctive behavior at an early age.MyParenTime.com highly recommends the book, ""The Tending Instinct"" -- this book is wonderful! It is clearly written and very interesting. Readers will find it greatly informative!"
1,church of engkland,"this book is blatantly anti Anglicanism, and a bit of over dramaticing his own effectiveness as an Anglican priest. i'm surprised the Church put up with him as long as they did. If so wonderful, why is he not a Catholic priest? Book has interesting insight, but darn if he can't quash even that with his own emotional biases."
4,Reality Transporter,"The book is really interesting and fascinating. You will get hunger for more. While you read the book, it's like you're living the adventure of the characters, it trasportates you to the books reality."
3,Runnin' With The Jorma Crowd,"The first song, Runnin' with the Fast Crowd, is a very catchy tune. It plays over and over in your head even if you haven't listened to it in months or even years. The rest of the songs are pretty forgettable. I can't recommend an entire album for one song, but it's up to you. It is Jorma we're talking about, after all."
2,Jorma goes punk.,"This is Jorma's punk rock album. There is some feeble blues rock with Milkcow Blues Boogie other wise there is a lot of hyperactive rock and roll. It hasn't improved any with time. In fact, the sound is quite dated. If it weren't for the classic blues feel of the title cut this recording would be without any value...Simon"
5,bears hat,"the hat was a gift that was requested . I thought it was cute , well made and warm looking"
3,Intimate and Opaque,"A mixture of raw demo and cabaret blues, Sam Phillips' Fan Dance sets its tone in the first few seconds - the creak of a chair while the guitarist gets cozy - and sustains this intimacy through its brief 34-minute playing time. Her pop ambitions are scaled back here -- no multi-tracked song suites! - though her songs are deeper if no less obtuse than on past releases. As a lyricist she favors the enigmatic verse over narrative - after six releases, the most bracing statement she ever made was ""Baby I Can't Please You"" (from the song of the same name). Her nearly haiku-like verse here isn't off-putting, though; more like impenetrable riddles that entertain the mind with their pointlessness! And when she wants to, which is more often these days, she tells you exactly what's on her mind: ""I'm wasting my time"", she says. ""Love is everywhere I go,"" she informs us. And, oh yeah, an admonishment - ironic or not I couldn't say - to ""say what you mean""."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in Sam Phillips' ""Fan Dance"" -- I have every album Sam has put out and I saw her perform in 1994 in Boston. It was a very intimate but very powerful show.My personal opinion, I think Sam has gone 360 degrees in the other direction -- in terms of music. I love the lush production on ""Martinis and Bikinis"". I favor the Beatlesque passion over the stripped down production on ""Fan Dance""Maybe this is a detour in an otherwise majestic catalog of fine pop music."
1,HORRIBLE AGAIN,"She should of stayed leslie phillips at least there she had some vocal ability. As sam phillips she shows what its like not to be a singer. Horrible, and I wouldn't recommend to anyone."
2,Cello rock,"OK, so there's a cello in only one of the numbers. I just seem to keep hearing one throughout. This was my first taste of Sam Phillips, and it's not something I'd grab to play while looking through my CD rack. I appreciate wanting to have a stripped-down sound (well, maybe I don't), but when you take away the instruments, the words and singing had better be pretty darn good, or what's the point of buying a CD?The singing is nice by who we need to be reminded repeatedly on the credits is Mrs. T-Bone Burnett, with Phillips-Burnett sounding like Jessica Rabbit doing her lounge act. This is a compliment. But all that's left is words, and I'm not that much of a poetry person to appreciate how these may be good or great lyrics.Sorry, but I like more music in my music."
5,Indescribably Wowed.,"On first listen, you realize how sparse the songs are. Just enough instrumentation to carry the songs along, deliver the beautiful melodies and generate the appropriate mood. But once you really start listening (and I DO recommend listening to it with headphones!!!) you can really feel these songs. The lyrics are classic Sam Phillips, some would have fit perfectly on ""Cruel Inventions"". I was alittle disappointed that the over-all length of the cd was alittle over 30 minutes... the trip may be short, but well worth it."
2,Not a feel good movie.,"All the leads are unlikeable, but the title is quite appropriate. I think propraganda films, which I believe this to be, are evil and do no good."
5,Best movie ever!,"Excellent item and DVD special edition, which the movie La Haine even in regular DVD edition is no longer available in France (where it was made). I just got back from there, and could not find it in ANY dvd shoppe in Paris....So if you've liked this film, I suggest you buy it on amazon.com!!!! Excellent for any film studies class or French class, to add to the curriculum as well! Definitely 2 thumbs up!"
5,Faster than expected shipping.,"I wanted to get this film for my sister, but it was hard to find in the months before Christmas. I was told to expect this item up to 2 weeks after Christmas, but I received it not only ahead of time but in perfect condition."
1,Aweful Film,This film is wicked boring. I had to watch it for a French Film class and it was the worst film. I had to watch it several times cause I kept falling asleep!
5,"Hip Hop, France, and Viva La Revolution!","My all time top 5 movie. Great cinematography, story, and urban French hip hop depiction. Must see... enough said. Oooo and its filmed in black and white."
1,what are these people talking about!,"i bought this cd over the summer, becuz i liked that song ""steal my sunshine"". and becuase it was only $10 so i figured, why the hell not? now i know why not. if you thought all of len's songs were just like ""steal my sunshine"" u were wrong and you better be ready for all this hip-hop mess. not like theres anything wrong with that, but i personally cant stand rap, im more of a foo fighters/blink person...now the sunshine song is way old and theres no more reason to listen to it. i just couldnt believe i payed for this with my own money."
1,How about no stars? No innovation=No stars,"It is definitely a sad state of affairs when groups like these people can get away with ""making"" music like this. The ignorant listeners are fooled into thinking they're hearing something new, when their entire sound is actually jacked from other artists who really DO have talent. My faith in the human race has dropped as a result of the popularity of albums like this one."
5,So I missed a million miles of fun...,"Len is a great group! I love their song ""Steal My Sunshine""! If you havent all ready buy their CD! It rocks! :P"
4,Not a Bad Debut,"LEN fuses hip-hop and pop in an interesting and catchy way. ""You Can't Stop the Bum Rush"" contains old school hip hop throwbacks as well as interesting pop-ish tunes. The album has its flaws and ideas that do not mesh -- but for the most part it is a solid effort. ""Cryptic Souls Crew"" and ""Feeling Alright"" make this album more than a one hit phenomenon -- and being competitively priced as it is, it is a good value."
2,hip hop what...?,"This album is nothing but candy coated corporate push-it-down the consumer's throat music. I think len does have some talents musically, and some of the songwriting i actually like... but this definitely belongs in the young teeny-bopper (aka...backstreet boys, Spears) category. I'll put my Raising Hell tape on continous play..."
1,Should have bought the single!,"How many times have you heard a new song on the radio, rushed out to buy the CD, and realized that the rest of the CD is totally different and you frankly just don't care for it? Len is a prime example of this phenomenon. Everyone heard ""Steal My Sunshine"" and rushed to thier local record store, including me. I was disappointed to discover that aside from ""Steal My Sunshine,"" there are no other pop-sounding tracks on the album. Once track 2 hits, it's monotonous rap/hip-hop from there on out. It starts with the bland, repetitive ""Cryptic Souls Crew"" and goes downhill from there. Add Len to your list under ""one-hit wonders."""
1,One Hit Album,"Aside from Steal my Sunshine I really dont think that this album is very good. I bought it thinking that it would all be pop type music , but the majority of it turned out to be rap and wierd stuff . Dont buy it unless you are in to rap."
2,LEN Learn The Hard Way,"YOU CAN'T STOP THE BUMRUSH relies on natural appeal and acertain measure of curiosity in luring its pottential purchaser onlyto leave them ultimately embarased for having made the purchase with relatively nothing to show for their money. High on style, but low on substance, ""BUMRUSH"" proves to be this year's most inaccesible ""summer album"", a stylistically bi-polar see-saw of odds-and-sods from a band desperately in need of direction. Glimmering for but a brief moment with ""Sunshine"", LEN quickly fade into a musical void of useless ""experiments"" in hip-pop forcibly nestled between a colourfull pimp hat and cane.Although stand-out tracks ""Cryptic Souls Crew"" and ""Beautifull Day"" jive with the urgency and intensity of a perfect summer day, the balance of the mix fails to induce the promised sensory climax implied by it's lead-off single. My advice, don't be conned by LEN."
1,Only 1 good song,"Obviously, ""Steal My Sunshine"" is the best song on this CD - the rest is nothing like it and pretty boring to be honest. This is Len's chance to drop the other junk and focus on their niche if they make another CD. Otherwise, they can just hang it up and kiss the money goodbye!"
3,"Not bad, but 'Steal My Sunshine' is the best song on it",'Steal My Sunshine' is clearly the best song on the CD. The rest of the CD sounds nothing like it. It is more like really poppy hip-hop. You might be advised to listen to the samples of the other songs and check out the 'Go' soundtrack if the rest of this CD doesn't appeal to you.
4,"Not what you would expect from ""Steal My Sunshine""","If you're thinking of picking up this album in hopes of finding 12 songs in the same sty of ""Steal My Sunshine"", you are going to be somewhat surprised. This album shows a great range of musical influences from Biz Markie and Kool Moe D to more contempory top 40. I really liked tracks 1-3 and 9. This album won't go down as one of the great albums of our time, in fact, the only other possible hit would be ""My Brain's All Broke"", but this is a fun and enjoyable album that always finds is wa back into my CD player for another lisen."
4,Cool CD,"This CD is the most unique ever. Every track is different. I bought this CD for the second track, which I heard on the radio. I don't like ""Steal My Sunshine."" Anyways, I kinda wish that more songs were like the second and third on the CD. More lyrics were needed, and the last track ended the album on a low note. However, the CD is entertaining and diverse."
3,"Some are great. Others, well.....","The CD has some very catchy songs and a variety of beats. Sometimes I'm wondering if I'm listening to the same group all together. I like listening to 1 and 3 the most, but a couple of the others are pretty good. If you don't care for rap then you'll be skipping some songs. There is a mix of dance, hip-hop, and eighties sounds that should prove to keep you listening, but I could do without some repeated four letter words. This was a disappointment, because the music was great, but the lyrics belonged to wu-tang. Sorry, but minimal CD life without getting shelved for mixing later with other songs from other short lived bands."
4,Unexpectedly Awesome,"I liked Steal My Sunshine, and was hoping to hear something similar... but was happily surprised by Len's different style. SMS is a radio friendly song to cause the masses to rush out and buy it. The other part of the album has depth and a certain style all its own which is not for the masses. If you are a unique person, and not like everyone else, you'll appreciate Len's ability and insite of musical talent and ingenuity."
5,had to see how they went from steal my sunshine to biz marki,"remember pre firearm, jewelry, ""my life is a big porn movie with alotta weed in between girls"" hip hop?i doubt itcant blame you tho most of you weren't even therewanna go?get this albummake no mistakes this is not a pure hip hop expedition but the attitude on this album is straight up old skool hip hop and ultimately everything that makes this album great fun for the sake of fun from the well rotated ""steal my sunshine"" to ""man of the year"" an ode to biz markie to the biz's appearance itself on ""beautiful day"" this album sounds goofy, dated, pointless, and most of all beautifulwanna find purpose in these songs?put one oncrack a smilemission accomplishedif you have an open mind and can stand an hour or so of naive happiness in your life get this albumhonestly i mean who wouldn't want to have fun?"
2,"If you like ""steal my sunshine"" you will be disappointed","""Steal My Sunshine"" genuinely gels 70's AM bubblegum with a contemporary hip hop feel. It's a perfect pop song. A problem is that the rest of the CD in no way resembles this total epitome of the consumate ""guilty pleasure"" song.The rest of the CD is pedestrian hip hop and barely tolerable pop. I mean ""beautiful day"" and ""feelin alright"" are okay (like in a B-side kind of way) but they are incomparable to the hit single. The rest are nothing, trippy hip hop songs.They hit the bulls eye with ""Steal my sunshine"" and that irresistable accompanying video.Here's some million dollar advice...just buy the single and forget about the rest."
3,"Rap, pop, metal?","i don't understand whether this is a rap album, pop, or metal, if you buy it because of steal my sunshine like i did, i think you will a little dissapointed because there are only about 5 songs out of that whole cd that have a similar beat with ""steal my sunshine"""
1,"Steal my Sunshine, Stole my money!","Like others before me, I bought the CD because of their single on the ""GO"" soundtrack. The rest of the CD is a BIG disappointment. This is a band that reeks of the ""One Hit Wonder"" Syndrome. Their rap stinks. Don't buy it."
2,Be careful! It's not what you think,"If you, like myself, think ""Steal My Sunshine"" is one of the best new tracks of the year, you probably want to hear more from this band. But watch out! The rest of the album is nothing like this song whatsoever. (And, I don't really like it.)"
5,A Must Add to Any Collection!,"A great mix of music styles, mellow, happy, fun- a must add! fun for a party!"
3,Good but not.,"This album isn't too bad really. Its definitely not going to be winning any Grammy's but it does have some catchy tunes. And it may have some guys rapping on it but since they aren't rapping about bustin' caps, smokin' crack, and slappin' hoes it really doesn't qualify as a hip hop or rap album. Like many reviewers have stated previously, the single, Steal My Sunshine, like so many of the songs on the album, is not like any other track on it. All in all its got 3 or 4 pop tunes that are worth a listen."
2,"Please, Please, Stop The Bums Rush","Man are these guys .... Standard white boy `hip hop', emphasizing parties and macho posturing. Sort of a cuter and more modern version of the Beastie Boys, but somewhat less interesting. Not surprisingly, the hits (`Feelin Alright' and `Steal My Sunshine') are the best tracks precisely because the band doesn't try to rap. One is reminded of like minded lameo Everlast, but although the lows are just as low, the highs are not as high."
1,RIGHT! NOT GOOD,"This CD is just a one hit wonder nothing more than that because the rest of the CD cant live up to the smash hit ""steel my sunshine"". This make me mad that it sound like the beat to most of these songs where stolen strait from Moby's CD ""play"" and the songs are just horrible. The worse song on this CD is track thats were I stopped listening and figures that the rest of the CD couldn't get as bad as track 2. ""I can't stop the bum rush"" but I can stop you from wasting your money on this CD. People if you like ""steal my sunshine"" than your better off buying a single with all the remixes for ten bucks because 4 remixes of ""steel my sunshine"" is a lot better than a whole CD of garbage. If any of you people heard a sample of track 2 you will change your mind about buying this CD. I hope I saved you from waisting your money on somthing that could have been so good but is just so bad."
2,Sorely dissapointing.,"What happened to the great tunes of ""Steal My Sunshine?"" First of all, the recording of Steal My Sunshine on this CD is different than the one that they play one the radio, they add a stupid conversation between the group members. That was the first thing I didn't like. The second is that all the other songs are horrible. The one songs is ""sung"" by what sounds like a computer generated voice, you cant even tell what it'ssaying. This group tries to mix pop, hip-hop, and rap all together. It mixes about as well as oil and water. Total waste of money."
3,It's actually 3&1/2 stars...,"The beauty of this album lies in its simplicity. these dudes are from Canada, where hip-hop doesn't come in all the forms that it comes in the states. Because of this, the hip-hop that American Pop culture might think of as stale-- Classic Rick Ruben, Run D.M.C., The Beatsie's, and LL--is alive and kicking without the help of Puffy style cash-money stylings, or Master P style incoherency. For all true hip-hop heads, Let me tell you, I'm one of you, and when I heard this album, I thought of it as a cheesy pop version of better hip hop. But it's so damn catchy that I couldn't help but listen to tracks like ""Beautiful Day"" because nobody beats the biz. This one's a decent buy."
1,1-Hit Wonders,"Glad we got a great one hit wonder out of this summer..good job on ""Steal My Sunshine"" but, with all the mixing help this CD Seems to have you still missed the boat. So long Len..I hope great memories carry you through the rest of your tired music."
1,Don't buy it!,"If you like the single, don't expect the album to follow suit. This is another one of those cases in which the label decided which single would best sell instead of best represent the album in its entirety. Not recommended."
5,There is something for everybody in the album!,"I think the album was great. There's something for everyone. It twisted old school, rap, and rock into one album and it sounds great! I hope they can keep making great music like this! Good job Len and good luck!"
1,it sucks.....,"If you like whiteboy rap with terrible flow, this cd is for you. I loved ""steal my sunshine"" but the rest completely sucks. They arent even good rappers and thats the genre most prevailent here. Just buy the single."
3,Good But Not Great,"What's with all these people saying "" I can't hear what they're singing,"" All you haye to do is turn up the Treble on your stereo. If you really want to hear the lyrics turn down the bass."
1,STEAL MY HOOK!,"I'm not a fan of samples. Poor Steely Dan, they're probably even LESS of fans...Anyway, Steal My Sunshine is actually 2 measures of ""MORE MORE MORE"" by the Andrea True Connection. It's a great club song, and 1000 times better than what LEN does to it. So everyone go by Andrea True's greatest hits (on Amazon too!). All of it's good stuff."
4,Not Bad....,"I got this CD yesterday and I think it is a pretty good CD... here are My reviews:Best songs: Steal My sunshine Cryptic Souls Crew Crazy Cause I (or something like that)Worst songs:big meanie WHY? to many swears! they are not neededthe hard disk approach- to wierd for wordseverything else is eather good or fair.I say you should buy it and skip 5 and 11.A good CD overall, one of my favorites of my collection."
2,Disappionted,"I loved Steal my Sunshine so I bought the Len CD.Only, steal my sunshine is a good song.i hardly understand some of the words of the other songs and they r pretty bad. just get the steal my sunshine single and spend ur money on something else"
3,Not the worst,"I heard ""Steal..."" first off and checked into the CD some more. There is one, maybe two other songs of that same feel and beat, but the rest is soso at best. If you're looking for more songs like ""steal..."" this isn't the right place to look. On the whole, the CD isn't bad, but it's not great either."
2,"Not bad, but don't buy for ""Steal My Sunshine""","The album is mixed bag of an old-but-new-school rap (like J5), a heavy loop track, the hit from the GO soundtrack, a Biz Markie cut, some poorly executed lyrics, a funky Green Day-like track, a gospel laced track...quite a diverse mix of music. Which isn't necessarily a good thing. It seems like the lack of a strong thread through all the tracks left each of them a little weak. If you like ""Steal My Sunshine"", stick with the Go Soundtrack. A main drawback is that the album, when you eliminate the popular ""Steal My Sunshine"", runs a short 40 minutes. Sorry, but more time should have been spent in the studio, perhaps refining the sound. If you are adventurous, it might be worth a try."
5,One Of The BEST Albums Of The Nineties,"This is one talented group and an inspiring album with a range from hip hip to eighties style pop. Every tune has its own essense. No matter who you are, you'll find something to like about LEN! I have loved this album since it's release. Everyone should own it! It's every bit as good as Digable Planets if you can believe that. I consider ""You Can't Stop The Bum Rush"" one of the best albums of the nineties, and this is just the beginning. I just caught the show at the El Rey in Hollywood, CA and these guys are tight! Sharon is the true star, the next Lauryn Hill. She and her brother ended the show with a rendition of the Laverne and Shirley theme! Actors from That Seventies Show were present and grooving down to Sharon and Len! This is the band to follow and the album to own!"
4,It's different.,"I came across this album in a thrift store, never heard of the band but found the album artwork interesting so I bought it for $1.25. As soon as I heard ""Steal My Sunshine"" I immediately recognized it from VH1's 1 hit Wonders of the 90s. The rest of the album is a mix of genres, ranging from hip hop to pop rap to techno. ""Cryptic Souls Crew"" is okay, but sounds like it a ""Rappers Delight"" knockoff. ""Man of the Year"", which is a tribute to Biz Markie is my fave song, it has a techno sound and cool robotic vocals, sounds like something you heard from 2000. Cold Chillin is my 3rd favorite, it's a great party track. All the other songs are alright more like fillers. Overall this a cool album, still blows my mind I was in elementary school when this came out and now I've graduated from college. Its almost 13 years old, but its still a great album."
2,VALUE,For all the costs involved in purchasing the Jedi Robe it was'nt worth it.Shipping/handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item. I will never shop Amazon or any online store.
3,A pretty good read,"I'm definitely a fan of Robyn Carr and will read anything she has written but, having said that, this is not one of her best efforts in my opinion. As always, Ms. Carr is worth reading but don't expect this to equal her Virgin River or Grace River series."
2,Never too Late to get started....,"I have read almost all of Robyn's books and for some reason, this one dragged on a bit. Although, I loved the characters and commend Robyn for always expressing the importance of safe-sex! I am waiting patiently for the next Virgin River Book to come out and can sincerely say that it is the characters of that series that are the best/colorful. While this book did somewhat succeed at holding me over a little bit until the next Virgin River book, I found that I couldn't wait to get it over with but was unable to devour it as I do her other books."
5,Never to Late review,Robyn is a great writer. She creates characters that you can believe in. I have read the entire Virgin River Series and all three Grace Valley books. Can't wait for her new series.
2,Hard going,I found this book difficult. The main characters weren't very likeable and the only thing that really stopped me from walking away were a couple of the secondary characters. I'm a big fan of Robyn Carr but this is a long way from her best.
5,Dear Robyn Carr~,"Loved it!!!!Wow.Seriously, I was due for a ""damned, good book"" and NEVER TOO LATE was the one I'd been waiting for!!!!I loved Clare. Heck, part of me is Clare, lol!!! And Sarah. Whoa. Did the whole plain thing hit home!!! And, yes, I have two sisters who ARE Maggie--gotta love her!!Thank you so much for writing an intelligent, romance, women's fiction story that touched me, made me giggle, made me swoon AND had me rethinking the way I live my life!!!Fabulous. Simply fabulous!!"
5,An entertaining biography of P. T. Barnum,"I read this books several years ago, and found it very amusing. It not only tells Barnum's story, but it also gives background on the lives of the different people associated to him, like midget Tom Thumb. Recommended."
3,Good book - rather short,"It's a good book, but not for an interested reader of popularized science. For the scientist or student it is rather short. Still a good book to have though."
3,Not for beginer,"Not suitable for beginer if you try to study yourself, esecially from chapter IV on the prove is not quite straightforward."
2,A hard read,"This is a very difficult book to read. It's translated from German, and it shows. I would advise against this as a primary text.It might be cheaper than other books, but unless your in Germany, reading the original german, it's not worth it."
3,Old Fashioned,"I read the first couple chapters, trying to learn differential geometry on my own. The approach that this text uses seems a bit dated. Most of the terminology used isn't frequent in modern math texts. If you're an undergrad and interested in the subject, I found that the Springer book by Andrew Pressley is a much nicer option for self-teaching. It has a modern feel to it, and all the exercises have hints or solutions in the back, so you can check your work, or get help when stuck."
1,low quality cable,"I have an older pair of Blue Kiwi cables - well made, gold contacts, great performance. This new cable, although the same name, had an un-shrunk shrink wrap, plain ""silver"" contacts, and is a different shade of green. Not the same cable at all. I was disappointed."
4,"Sometimes easy, sometimes challenging!","I rented this game for my 4-year-old son. He was able to play through the first level, which is basically the tutorial, with ease, but once you pass that, the game becomes somewhat complicated with a huge playing field and tons of challenging mini-games. The flow is a bit hard to follow and certain sections I just could not figure out where to go (remember, this was a rental).The graphics are very good, too. I'll probably buy this game for him (and myself)."
5,Challenging for all ages,"This game is fun to play and fun to watch the 6 year old grandson play. Emile gives helpful hints along the way, yet there is plenty to figure out for yourself to keep the game interesting. What is not always obvious to an adult is a fantastic surprise when the grandson figures it out first. Everyone (G) Rating is on target. Watch the movie, it's a hoot."
4,Post Oscar award fun...,"Ratatouille is a lot of fun... it looks good and plays well. It makes you think just enough and at times make you overthink on completing tasks.Exploding peppers, stinkbugs and a mad french chef... fun. All because of a rat intent on becoming the ideal french chef. Hail Disney / Pixar."
5,Great material for a newbie,"I watched this DVD twice in a row, and suffice to say, it is a great (not just good) piece of informative ""insider tips"". I learnt alot of little things that only years of experience (and mistakes) would impart. This DVD has earned it's place on my bookshelf reference section.Excellent work Greg."
1,Nothing learned,"I purchased this DVD in hopes of learning a few tricks to help speed up my job. I found that there wasn't very much applicable knowledge passed on. He tells you how to practice brushing and rolling and dye your spackle so you don't forget where that hole is you just fixed. There was also nothing on exterior painting like it said there was. Seems like a nice guy and a good painter, but not a teacher of his trade."
2,Weird and Disappointing,"The contemporary scenes in the book, narrated by the Ukrainian interpreter, got me through the book. The scenes from the past were weird and self-indulgent. The book comes together as you move through it, but I'm not sure it's worth the journey."
2,Strange book - why the big fuss about it?,I read this book to the end because my friend really liked it. But it was rather strange for my taste. Parts of it were entertaining - especially the amusing English letters from the young Ukrainian guide. Some of the portions about the Holocaust might have had some historical truth. But so much of the book was the author's fantasy that I couldn't tell if they did.
1,wow,did this kid really have penguin print his book to look like it's one of their old classics?even the book jacket is as superficial as the book in this instance.wow.
1,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"(Possible spoiler ahead) I read this book in a book club a few years ago and absolutely hated it. There is nary a truth to be found in it. Instead you get the pastiche of truth. This is a grossly immature work of fiction. If I recall correctly, toward the end there is a span of pages with barely a word aside from rows of punctuation. Perhaps this is an effort to give the reader a sense of the feeling of illumination. Instead it comes across as a painful sign of having a complete lack of ideas. Not to mention Dave Eggers did the same thing in 'A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius'. But the truth is, a good writer will give you that moment where you look up from the page, totally in awe, and you will revel in the change of your world view. This stuff here is not that stuff."
5,Favorite Jeans,Wrangler Aura jeans made for women are my favorite jeans. They come in a wide range of sizes so you can find what fits you best.
3,Fit of Aura jeans,"These are usually very nice jeans, and the long-rise size is a perfect fit for me. The last pair I got was made in southeast asia instead of in south america, though, and the fit was not as good. A number of the details that made a difference had been skimped, and they were not identical to a pair of the same style, size, length, etc. I bought at the same time from a local vendor, which had been made in Nicaragua. Delivery from Amazon was as prompt as ever."
2,Its a school book,"I bought this book for a college class and the next semester they changed the book. I read some things on my own and found some good but I don't think it was worth the money. I still have it though because when I read it, it makes me feel smart. Plus they come out with new ones all the time...dont buy it new. Just get a used one. All they change is the cover and a couple inserts so the pages are different and you think its different than the old one. Dont be fooled."
1,"They try so hard to be scary, it's actually comical","""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" is a great tune (used to great effect in some movie from the 80's in which David Bowie played a vampire). Definitely, the highlight here. Which is a bad sign considering that was the first release from these clowns. The rest of this disc is awful; music that's supposed to frighten but ends up being laughable. Kind of reminds me of Count Floyd from SCTV when he was showing some movie that wasn't frightening at all ........""Oooh, this is scary kids""!!!"
5,The Best Place to start if you're interested in Bauhaus,"This is probably the best collection to start with if you're interested in discovering the joy that is Bauhaus. It starts off with stuff from the first releases In The Flat Field and Mask, and then get's into the last couple releases The Sky's Gone Out and Burning From the Inside, along with a great cover of David Bowie's ""Ziggy Stardust"" for good measure (to make up for the cover of ""Telegram Sam"" I assume). This record is a good deciding point on whether you'd like to pursue Bauhaus or not. If you like Crackle you'll probably like the studio albums from Bauhaus, and if you don't like it then at least you've gotten the gist of it without spending over $."
4,Decent introduction to the 'Haus collection,"Pete Murphy, feedback, Love & Rockets spinoff, non-Goth Goths, Maxell tapes, we were all there...If you've not heard anything by this band then some caution is required. Bauhaus are not for everyone. Sometimes I'm not even sure they're for me. However, this CD does have some classic cuts that can't help make you think Bauhaus flirted with genius at points in their career (Bela Lugosi, Ziggy Stardust etc) whilst mediocrity also came knocking every so often."
1,Pretty disappointing,"I had high hopes for this purchase, but I was pretty disappointed. The contrast on the display is pitiful. Don't let that picture fool you. It's a sticker that comes on the unit prior to putting the battery in. Once the sticker is gone and the battery is installed it's contrast isn't as sharp. Putting the buttons on the back of the unit makes using this product very difficult. It has really bad usability all the way around. They spent all of their design budget on making it look cool, instead of work well. I gave up using the radio feature alltogether since the buttons are so annoying. Now its just an expensive clock..."
2,More of the Same- 2 1/2 stars,"This is basically the same movie as the first, except it is moved to Europe, obviously the reason being that people would have caught on that this is the same movie if it was still set in America. The worst part is that some of the jokes used in the first movie are used again in the sequel, which was funny the first time but not the second. If you liked the first movie, you will enjoy European Gigolo, and if you haven't seen this movie yet-you're not missing anything. The two movies are so similar that they don't need a third if it's anything like this. There is no way that a third movie could be any different. Yeah, the jokes were funny but to tell the same jokes again, it doesn't work. The series definitely needs to die. With all that said, it was still a decent movie."
1,Has funny moments but falls fat on it;s face as beeing a bad sequal with bad acting and a bad story,"I enjoed the original but did not enjoy this one. Yes there is funny moments but not lots to make this film good. It's another pointless sequal that fallows lots of pointless sequal movies like Analyaxe that, Miss congenality 2, whole 1o yards. The story is so stupid and pointless, the acting is really bad. The whole movie is bad from start to finish."
5,Short and to the point.,"Forget everything bad you've heard about this movie. The people who didn't like it shouldn't have been watching it in the first place, they would've been happier watching Captain Morelli's Mandolin. Bottom line, if you liked the first one then you'll like this one too. Thanks for your time."
4,I laughed really hard.,"There is a lot of crude humor in this movie, so if you are easily offended, I wouldn't suggest watching. Otherwise, if you are like me and can relax and handle the humor, this is a great movie for that. I laughed so much that I had wet eyes at one point. I was slightly disappointed in Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and I wasn't even going to rent this one, but I decided to and I'm glad that I did. If you're unsure, at least rent this, it's worth it."
3,Perversely amusing!!,"I like the Deuce Bigelow character--a low achieving guy who has a gift for genuinely connecting with others. There were enough laughs in this for me to recommend it. In particular I liked the political humor.However, there were some uncomfortably ridiculous moments and some gross-out humor that I did not enjoy and felt detracted from the film. Despite this, there is a pervasive sweetness to the film and to the Bigelow character that makes me like him anyway."
4,HILARIOUS!!!,i cant believe some people say this movie isnt funny and give it 1 freaking star...how lame can u be...i saw this movie with 5 friends and the whole movie we laughed til there were tears coming out our eyes...who cares if this movie pokes fun at other cultures and penis sizes and america and canada and whatever else offends stupid people...watch the movie and laugh your @$$ off at its genius...one of the funniest movies ever...giant step above the original
2,Similar as first one but worse,"I actually liked the first Deuce Bigalow movie and thought this one would be good, too. Well, it was similar, but not in a good way. It's almost as if they ran out of ideas and decided to just bring in some from part one. Also, I didn't like that some of the characters from part one got killed off. Sure, I had a few laughs, but overall it just wasn't all that good. I'm selling mine, if anyone wants to buy it..."
3,"A Rehash Of The First, But Not Bad As So Many Claim","This sequel to the outrageous Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo brings back our beloved Fish Tank cleaner/Fish Taker/Occasional Male Prostitute, only this time it takes place in Amsterdam. it seems there is someone killing all the male prostitutes of that area. Its is up to Deuce (Rob Schneider) and T.J (Eddie Griffin)to find out who. Many cameos from the previous movie appear here, so that's good. The humor here is well balanced, but not as outrageously funny as the first. Plenty of the humor has been recycled from the first movie. but besides that it is a decent sequel that can be enjoyed by fans of the first or by others who have not seen the first. Worth viewing, and perhaps owning if you are a fan.MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5"
4,Good comedy,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was really funny and had an original story line to it. It all depends if you can appreciate gross out toilet humor which this film is full of. Yes it's cliched and you've seen it a million times in other films, but it still manages to do it right. If your looking for great acting and creative humor than this isn't for you. But if your looking for just something to laugh at, than this is worth renting."
3,bad acting with a good title no not the film justthe title of the film zsf,rob schnieder is the worst comedy actor in holly wood tobemaking films like these people have couldnt like a crude and not very crude comedy like this there both pretty the same with their humor but this one couldnt have been because of the funny acsents or for the prosituting this movie just had tobe about the crudeness and the intregitybut still this film isometimes good and horrible but this wasnt suppost to act dumb or good it was trying to act like a rip off the first one whitch couldnt be better or worse for the movie
4,Not as good as the original,"Okay, overall this may not be as good as the first one, but what it lacks in a storyline it makes up for in jokes. Deuce is forced to be a gigolo once again, to help his poor buddy TJ out of a jam. Along the way, Deuce meets even more bizarre characters and the jokes dare go that extra step further. Imagine what happens when a woman with a penis for a nose sneezes..!!While the cast this time round are mostly all unknowns, there a couple of funny performances by Deuce's rival male gigolos. Look out especially for Norm MacDonald who plays a male gigolo from Scotland.I encourage all fans of the first and all Happy Madison movies to purchase this movie as you will not be disappointed. It is not loaded with special features, but there are a few short featurette's to keep you satisfied."
2,Not funny,"I like the first Deuce movie, but the sequel is a disaster. I've never kept such a straight face during a comedy. The jokes were stale and middle school level. Just a horrible money and a waste of money (both mine and the studio's.)"
2,!!!!Dumb and stupid.!!!!.if you must see it rent it!!!!!!!,"I dont like to review really bad movies.!!!Deuce bigalow was funny and stupid,but was a barrel of laughs. unfortunatly,the sequel is very stupid,and boring. I saw it in the movies.!!!what was i thinking? !!! rent it if you must see this flick... rating no cigar."
2,Big disgrace for a classic comedy,"The original Deuce Bigalow was a classic, pretty well written, and downright funny. This movie was less than an 1/8 as funny, with a whole lot less tact. Sure, gross out jokes are funny if done right. This movie, they overdid them, and most of them just weren't funny. Save your money, rent this, or if you have a way to see it for free then do. I saw it in the dollar theaters, and I felt ripped off. Rob Scneider needs to move to something different. Do not even think about a third one."
3,More of the same with much less flair,"European Gigolo isn't a complete waste of time to watch. In fact, if you did enjoy the first one, you'll find a bit of amusement in this one as well. The first one is far superior though and this sequel just runs through the same kind of gags. The women he takes out have bizarre problems that are completely fictitious, where as in the first one, those were real problems people could actually have. I don't want to spoil it completely for anyone who hasn't seen it, but you'll know it when you see one of the women Deuce takes out. She wears a bandana/handkercheif on her face, and that's all I'll say about that. If mindless entertainment is what you're after, you'll have a good time in Europe with Deuce but you will likely find it pales in comparison to its predecessor."
3,pretty Good track,"this track was pretty good though with Him,Nas&Keith Murray I expected a bit more but this track was pretty good&catchy enough to get into."
2,This song absolutely reeks!,"What kind of lyrics are those anyway?! ""Did you ever think that you would be this rich?"" What kind of message are we sending to the youth of today? They're becoming numb to this kind of stuff and they're becoming overly pre-occupied with the acquisition of money and material things. Tisk! Tisk! Mr. Kelly! Write some more far-reaching lyrics that address more important issues. I'll give it two stars for encouragement. --Kelly Magovern"
3,Flashdance meets Road House,"This one is so creaky, you can practically see the mechanical parts all moving as the film progresses. I guess it's some sort of homage to the late teen filmmaker John Hughes. We are supposedly in the early 80s here, but I kept noticing anachronisms like basketball shorts below the knee. Those did not exist in the early 80s. I don't think too many wore backwards baseball caps then, either. Yet no one is really dressing as lamely as they actually did back then, nor are the hairstyles as bad as they should have been for the period. The script is above-average, but you won't recall this one after 48 hours."
1,A WASTE of TIME and MONEY!,"My title says it all. This is one of the worst movies I've ever made the mistake of buying. It makes no sense; the acting is terrible, and their is no plot. Complete waste of time! I bought the movie because Ashley Greene (Twight) who plays an excellent actress (as a vampire in that movie) I thought may be good in this movie. NOT! I really can't, for all sakes and purposes call this a movie! Maybe an exercise in what an actor, director and writers should NOT do."
5,A Great Help!,The Beasy Board has been a great help to my mom and has made life much easier for her. We have to thank the Physical Therapist she had in the hospital who recommended it. It needs to be used to transfer off and on chairs that have a removable side or no side.
2,"TARZEN, EL TOPO, AND JESS FRANCO?!","Cheapoh German movie, made for under five hundred thousand dollars, set entirely on a raft on a South American river---it probably had a major influence on Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW.The photography is very good, considering the circumstances. And kinksi is ok; he's considered some great actor mostly because he behaved like a scumbag.A poor horse is thrown off a raft, and into a jungle, maybe to die in real life. And monkeys are shown jumping off the raft and swimming away, with kinski even throwing a monkey into the water----with no director commentary about what happened to them, so it's easy to imagine the worst happened to these animals once their use as movie props were over with."
3,"Sad, depressing, tedious","This film is a slow, grinding, expression of human misery. I urge you to avoid this film unless you take interest with the subject. Werner, I like your films, but couldn't you have found something cheerful to develop in this one? Oh, I forgot, you're German! Don't go there."
3,More artistic than historic.,"Called ""A breathtaking journey into the heart of darkness.""The cinema tail of the conquest of 16 century Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) and how it might have been as they traverse the Amazon River (Filmed in Peru) in search of the mythical lost City of Gold.Some see it as real others see holes you can drive a truck through; Any way you see it this is a good place to start in the New German Cinema movement. A good choice of actors and great visuals. This is also an intense way to learn some German. The victim on the raft is full of arrows and he gets kicked before the revealing statement ""er ist tot""Jess Franco's Count Dracula (Special Edition)Nosferatu: The Vampyre/Phantom Der Nacht"
5,"""Hypnotic"", that's the word I was searching for...","I think Aguirre the Wrath of God is impressively insane. It has that feel for being caught (and then lost) in an endless, inescapable landscape. Be it traversing the mountains and cataracts, or on the wide, flat Amazon river drifting interminably between impenetrable jungles - feeling the unseen eyes of hostile natives constantly watching you - the atmosphere of this story started out dangerous and simply crazy, and then things just got steadily worse and worse, until they got as bad as things can get! I loved it. Cinematic art doesn't get much better than this film, imho."
1,"Great Film, But Don't Buy This DVD","Aguirre is an extraordinary film, animated by a brilliantly crazed performance from Klaus Kinski, and filled with spectacular images (the ending with the monkeys is only the most indelible moment). But steer clear of this DVD. Why? It's pan-and-scan! Unbelievable! One of the most beautifully photographed films of the last three decades, and the makers of the DVD decide to mutilate it. I was so excited finding out that Aguirre was going to be released on DVD, then crushed as the film began and I realized it had been hacked up. Everyone connected with this travesty should be flogged, salted, and left in the sun for ants. Maybe if we refuse to buy this DVD, they'll eventually release a version that isn't mutilated."
5,mutilation? hardly,"aguirre, the wrath of god is certainly an amazing film. herzog's photography is some of the best ever filmed, along with kinski's world class performance... herzog filmed aguirre with a camera that he stole from his film school which had a filming aspect ration of 1:33(full screen). though new yorker video released a 'widescreen' version of this film, that version is a matted version of the full screen print. in addition to having a very well mastered print, in its original aspect ratio, we get a full commentary by none other than herzog himself. for this reason i strongly recommend this dvd."
4,herzog at his best (but hardly his weirdest),"werner herzog is a genius. this film is definitely my top 3 favourite herzog films. it's examining classic herzog thematics like the lone warrior battling against all odds (as seen in fitzcarraldo, heart of glass and in herzog's own life). much more straight forward when compared to films like 'dwarves' or 'fata morgana' but just as twisted and enjoyable.briliant performances, photography, locations and direction.amazing, amazing film."
3,"Five-star movie, where's the widescreen???","If you buy the box set of Kinski/Herzog movies, one and only one is in the full-frame format: ""Aguirre,"" arguably their greatest collaboration. This separately-marketed DVD is also not letterboxed. Why, why, why? Given that ""Aguirre"" is one of the most visually majestic movies of all time, this shoddy treatment is a major disappointment"
2,acquirre,"This movie was not what i expected at all. I had liked fitzcarraldo much more, and i was hoping that this movie would be up to that standard. It drags on and on, with some pretty bad acting. Given the time that the movie was filmed, the special effects were understandable, but in the end i wish i had rented it, instead of buying it."
2,Boring,"Boring. The movie allegedly mixed two prominent stories together so the movie was not necessarily historically accurate. Aguirre seemed to be consumed with his own delusions. I have no idea why it was one of the ""All-TIME 100 Movies,"" except that Klaus Kinski did well in his role as an ill-spirited, egotistical, madman. At 45 minutes through the movie I did not know if I could make it the rest of the way through simply due to boredom. At the end of the movie my husband and I were hoping for the credits."
2,I don't get it,"The movie is slow with hardly no action as you might expect from adventure in the Amazon , the little action is somewhat incomplete and you might miss it if you blink .Say you get it for the plot ? I think it doesn't develop as much as it should , Aguirre just goes mad and that's it , no twists , no turns , no end , no point .As far as for the photography , it is ducomentry like with jerking camera first person view , long shots of nothing , the opening scence is indeed impressive but that's it.[....]"
4,One of Werner Herzog's Best,"I've had this movie for quite some time and must say that it's one of director Werner Herzog's best. Some of his films have fallen short of my expectations, but this one has held up. The scenery is beautiful, and the acting and plot are to match. Klaus Kinski is great in playing the tyrannical Aguirre. Eccentric movie, but still recommended."
4,Rusty Cannons and Bananas,"Colonialism and evolution! Larvae and tarnished helmuts! Occasionally, a sedan chair drifts through me, and then some ""terraces of climate""! Ahistorical, transcendental bliss is a difficult art to master. Dante-esque and brilliant, even in its predictable miscues! Did I mention the dried gourd?"
3,Rolling on a river,"The stunning Amazonian location make this film interesting. The story of of the crazed Aguirre (played by Klaus Kinski) floating down the Amazon looking for El Dorado is haunting and dreamlike but also a test of ones patience. Herzog and Kinski had far greater success in the Amazon some years later with the incredible - verging on insane - ""Fitzcaraldo""."
2,Spring from the cellar,"2 1/2A tad up from generic punk, there are a few positively un-stereotypical moments thrown into the otherwise humdrum experience."
4,"Cool, but repetetive","Man, I love the beastie boys and I love this C.D. even though it is almost completely made up of re-mixes of Body Movin' that you can find elsewhere. The lyrics are good(""if you play Defender I could be your Hyper Space"") and the music is cool, too. The re-mixes are all different and they don't take away from the original songs' qualities. If you really like the Beastie Boys you should get it and if you are not too sure if you like the Beastie Boys, it is not too expensive for an import so you might as well check it out anyway. Final Note: If you don't have the American version of this already than get this version, otherwise it is not a necessary addition to a Beastie Boys collection."
3,One of the discs was loose inside the package.,"Bought this as a gift for Christmas, unfortunately, one of the discs was loose inside the package so I had to open it to secure it. You could really hear it bouncing around. Who wants to receive an opened gift? I gave it to them anyway, asking them to let me know if it didn't work. So far I haven't heard anything, will have to return it if it is scratched."

5,Tremendously Funny!!,This is a collection of cartoons from the best of the best of college cartoonists and is wonderfully funny. It proves how much talent has yet to be tapped in the cartoon world. I imagine many of these will be the cartoonists of our years to come!!
5,I VOTE CRAIG X,"After reading this book Craig became my hero. I have already passed it along to a friend and have others waiting in line. I have never been more satisfied with a purchase, or so proud to have the authors autograph. Craig gives those of us who are ""productive members of society"" (and those who are not) who believe the cannabis plant to be a wonderful and good plant despite what the government says new hope. He put hope in my mind as far as future presidents and will be voting Craig X for president in 2008. I am glad you shared yourself in this book Craig I enjoyed every word. I definitely recommend this book to EVERYONE is a good story, an intellectual read, and a great political theory.I am a 420 Elder and after you read this book I hope you choose to join us.

4,Tools and fingers needed.,"This awning looks good once you get it up if you have the skill set and tools. If your all thumbs you will have problems. The problem most will face is it is not well packet for such a heavy item and thing get bent. There is a good chance ends of the corner tubes will get smashed and you will not be able the get the proper tubes inside of these corner sections without some work. Also, all but one of the small roof tubes were safely shipped inside the legs. The one that did not have a leg to protect it was beet to hell. But......it's was worth the price."

5,No One Does It Better Than B.B.,No problem with the purchase of this product from the seller.Enjoying listening to B.B.'s most popular works. No one playsor sounds like him. He's truly and original and this productis a wonderful way to keep his legacy alive.
2,Poor Recording,"This recording is aweful. I've heard B.B. King in concert, and he sounds a lot better than this. This recording makes his voice sound harsh and flat. Maybe the LP is better. Try that instead of the CD."
2,Skip this one- it will disappoint you,"This CD features several old recordings that don't represent the greatest sound quality. Many of the cuts are un-listenable (if that's even a word!), terribly distorted. BB has so many great CDs to choose from. Do your ears a favor and skip this one! Try a few of the really great ones instead: ""Makin' Love is Good For You,""Makin' Love Is Good for You""Blues on the Bayou,"" ""Riding With the King,or ""One Kind Favor."""
4,Jim's Review,"Streep did an excellent job in this movie. All in all I thought it was just a fair movie but I know it got good reviews and many people lik,ed it."
4,Excellent performance by Streep,"Since the late 70's till the late 80's it seemed that every other movie had Meryl Streep in it. She's a top drawer actress even though lately her movie choices have been less than impressive. She really deserved her Oscar for this movie. The movie contains all the horrors of contration camps that you've seen in scores of other similar themed movies, but it is her riviting performance that will really impress you."
5,Excellence!,"I absolutely adore Meryl Streep. Her role as Sophie was captivating and very much entertaining. This film is filled with surprises, love, innocence, hate, betrayal, lust, forgiveness, doubt and uncertainty. All of which are the ingredients to make a great film. This may just be my favorite film starring Meryl Streep. I have so much admiration for Sophie and her choices, and Meryl did an amazing job in bringing this character to life evoking emotion from me as a viewer. Job well done!"
5,Top Ten Films,"""Sophie's Choice""; is by far a top ten film and definightly demonstrates why Meryl Streep is so highly acclaimed as an actress. This film is a great post WWII film. This is an amazing story with an ending the will get you thinking and prioritizing your life. Watch it or rent it and see for yourself."
5,Sophie's Choice,"For the first time, director Pakula exposed the breadth of Streep's prodigious talent when he cast her as Sophie. ""Choice"" is deliberately paced, literate, and atmospheric, and be warned - does include some disturbing flashback sequences. Above all, it's a Streep tour-de-force, netting her a well-deserved Oscar. Kline is also solid as the tragic Nathan. This devastating film will stay with you long after the lights come up."
3,Disapointed,"I don't know what I was expecting, but I was disapointed. Maybe I was just too tired when I watched it, so I will watch it again."
4,Gr8,i loved this compelling story of a young women's choice to part with her children. it was heart wrentching. a definate must see!
4,Stuffy but worthy,"The Bottom Line:One of those prestige-y, Oscar-bait adaptations of a critically-acclaimed work of literature that isn't quite as good as the producers think it is, (see also: The English Patient, The Hours, The Reader, Cold Mountain, etc.) Sophie's Choice is a fairly engaging and compelling piece of drama that is enhanced by Streep and Kline but marred by a overlong running length and a not-especially good Peter MacNicol; it's worth seeing but it's not a great film.3/4"
5,Masterpiece,"I know I had seen this movie back when it came out, but had forgotten alot. Definitely one of Meryl Streep's best ever..."
3,a bit too harrowing for even me,"meryl streep DOES give a great performance, but this is just a bit too downbeat for me. all those nazis, y'know? and as an aside, the commentary is the worst ive ever heard on a dvd, being recorded at the same volume level as the dialog, rendering BOTH unlistenable."
2,"Great Acting, Boring Story","Well i gave it a chance but sorry, it simply was too slow for my taste. While Meryl Streep was brilliant as Sophy the story simply dragged along and I lost interest. I may go back and see the edning but I highly doubt it. If there is a compelling story here, or message I did not see it. It would have been better to skip some of the unnecessary scenes and draw the viewr in from the beginning rather then slow pace it along. It may have been great for 82, but for today's fast pace audience it doesn't work very well. I had to put on Friday the 13th, afterwards in order not to feel cheated out of watching a video, now there is a film with action!"
1,I didn't like the movie,"Even though I really like the two main actors I didn't even finish watching the movie. Sorry, and I really like Holocaust themed books and movies."
3,"Excellent movie, mediocre transfer.","An emotionally engaging and exhausting film, Sophie's Choice is a very-well crafted drama. The character development is superb, as the viewer is presented with a penetrating analysis of Sophie in which her background and that of her lover Nathan is revealed in layers that serve to make the story even more captivating with each new chapter. A tragic story on many levels, this film left me emotionally drained. And yet I was also curious to learn more about the story behind the film even as I was shocked anew by the grotesque horrors of human cruelty represented by the holocaust.The DVD is okay, with muted colors and a Dolby Pro Logic sound mix that rarely ventures beyond the center channel. At least the DVD presents the film in its original aspect ratio. The extras are good, consisting of a historical documentary that weaves the story behind the film with oral history by holocaust survivors, and a theatrical trailer."
5,On Golden Pond/Sophie`s Choice.,"I liked On Golden Pond, and my wife liked Sophie`s Choice. I would recommend them to one and all. Ken."
4,An Oscar winner for sure!,"I can see why Meryl Streep won the Oscar for her performance! After listening to the audio version of the book, I had to then see Streep's acclaimed performance. I was pleased when the movie arrived quickly and in great shape. Great price too! I'd order from this seller again!"
1,"cheap chinese junk hammer with loose handle, not USA made as listed","First off this hammer is listed as being from the USA, big fat lie, the hammer they sent me was from china.I have used Plumb hammers for decades and love them.They have always been a great hammer. It is a shame stockholders pockets mean more than producing a quality hammer. This hammer is no where close to what I know a plumb hammer to be, the handle is very loose and the hammer head just looks like junk. So to all the cooper tool stockholders that think profit is best, you loose money this time because I am returning this junk and WILL NEVER buy another plumb hammer.Amazon made returning it easy but if they had told the truth to start with they wouldnt have to pay for return shipping."
1,"Stories, not plays","What a disappointment! I teach high school ESL, and I've had a lot of success using adapted classics and plays like others in the Penguin Readers series. My students did an adapted version of Romeo and Juliet last year, and they loved it. I thought this would be great ... but, despite the title, it isn't actually PLAYS. It's Three Great Plays, all right, but they're rewritten as narrative texts. Short stories, basically, which eliminates the oral language possibilities with ESL students and theater."
4,This video sets up the history of rock like no other!,"The video was informative and is leads to an awaking to those, like myself, that had preconcived notions about what rock and roll was and where it came from."
4,Hoyle's Encyclopedia of cards,"If you play card and think you know the rules you won't like this book because you probably made the your ""rules"" fit your game.Very helpful for new card game players"
4,Evrything is in here...,"Any card game you can think of is in here.If you are looking for how to play that card game you used to play, or heard about, or forgot...this is the guide for you!"
3,Lots of information but still lacking.,"I agree with another reviewer, the book needs a refresh. Hard to find the game you're looking for by just browsing (rather than using the index). Note that the copyright still says 1974 so it does feel a bit out of date. Was disappointed that it didn't include rules for Spades."
1,Old and poor explanations,"Since this book was published in 1974 and not updated since, no new games are included and many of the card games have changed names since then. Also the explanations of games are complicated and hard to follow, and often lacking critical details. You would do much better by searching online for card games and reading the rules off wikipedia."
1,Worst sound quality possible.,"It's impossible to understand the movie, because the sound quality is horrible. You can't hear the conversations. Just the special features have a normal sound. I have over sixty hindi movies and this one has the worst quality. Poor production."
5,Best present I ever bought myself,"I make a lot of small stuffed toys. It zips through medium weght material; it cuts thicker material, but is slow. The charge lasts through several cuttings. Recharging takes less time that I thought. When the charge is complete, the light on the plug changes to green. For really intricate cutting, a Fiskars hand held is better."
3,I lost my trust,"Although the focus of this book was to be about women's sufferage and Spiritualism in the 19th century, I lost faith in the book early on.I lost faith in the ""truth"" of the book when important facts about the Fox Sisters was either ommited, or misrepresented. This made me question the rest of the book's integrety and if all the facts had been properly researched.By studying the Fox Sister's and their facinating lives from other sourses, I learned that the ""rappings"" in their cabin did not start with the Fox Sisters, but had stared years before, and previous tenants had heard them. Even BEFORE the younger Fox Sisters had been born.But this book reports that the Fox Sisters had begun, possibly even faking, the sounds. This is an inaccuracy. Therfore, when I discovered this early on, I lost my trust in the author and consider thsi work, although researched, a work of fiction."
4,"'Mistress Of Marymoor"" By Anna Jacobs","Another great book by Anna Jacobs, This book is set in 1759, so this writer can do any era. This book will make your emotions go from sorrow to anger to hope and so on and so on. A well written novel, has all the things that make a great book. A must read. Well done again Anna Jacobs."
2,Pretty basic,"I'd give this book a higher rating if it had been titled ""A Primer on Pleasuring a Woman.""The information is accurate and clear. It could teach a man who's making his first contact with a woman to avoid major blunders. If his previous knowledge came from talk in the locker room or porn flicks, this book would correct some misinformation.But there's no ""secrets"" here. A man can learn everything in the book, and more, by just being moderately open and communicating with his partner."
4,Fun look at a long lost part of Florida,"Light and breezy, this book which was written in the 1950's captures much of the atmosphere of post WW II Florida. The message of concern over the loss of history and a sense of place comes through but with a sense of humor. The overall tone reminds me somewhat of John Cheever and John D. Macdonald with whisky drinking, broads and male bonding."
5,A great general history of the Corps,BGen Simmons' excellent general history of the Marine Corps is just that a general history. I note with distain the comments from the Alexandria reader. Clearly they don't understand the book's purpose and intended audience. It tells the tale. It doesn't twist tails with analyis.
2,TOO BROAD,Not a good historical book at all. It jumps from fact to fact without detail. Boring boring boring. Better to read bios or books on specific events.
2,"A good read, but a lightweight history","Gen Simmons has written a good, but very superficial history of the Marine Corps. If you know nothing of the service's history, this provides a good overview. But if you are interested in anything but a generic overview, based solely on secondary sources, and lacking any critical analysis, than move on to something else."
5,Budokan show is a DREAM,What an amazing group of musicians - and what a great concert DVD. Sounds great in 5.1 and DT blew me away with how tight they are live.
5,Some of the most gorgeous camera work I've EVER seen,"What an amazing concert on DVD! I've had this DVD for well over 3 years now and I tell you, this has got to be one of the most visually satisfying concerts ever recorded on DVD. Incredible camera work, incredible editing, and that's not even to mention the rocking set list from this concert. Truly an incredible buy. A must for any Dream Theater fan."
5,Simply the best,"The other reviews have basically hit upon the best points of the DVD, so I will not waste any more space. By far, the best recorded Dream Theater concert to date."
5,Ridiculously Excellent,"If you give this DVD less than 5 stars, I'll dropkick you.Excellent video quality. Excellent video production. Excellent light show. Excellent stage set-up. Excellent stage show. Excellent sound quality. Excellent(period).I have one minor complaint though... the guitar solos seem quiet... i'm not sure if it's just my stereo, but it's a little too much in the background for my liking.Other than that, this DVD is prime and if your a real Dream Theater fan, you already have it and have watched it a couple times. Also check out the live CD which is also really good (and u need it in order to complete your DT CD collection).***** ""BUY IT NOW"""
4,"Good, but not AWESOME!!!","My title says it all. I loved the other DVD releases for Dream Theater, have watched each a good amount, and have listened to all the songs enough times. The setlist was not to my full preference, but I still liked at least half the songs on the DVD, so that was not a problem as eveyrone has their own song preferences. I just felt that the songs lacked a certain energy. Obviously studio recordings are better, but Endless Sacrifice is one of my favorite songs and it seemed both rushed and flat to me. In the past, the live dvds ive seen contained a lot of live energy, which I did not feel/see on this new dvd. Also, I have heard complaints about the sound quality, which I agree with. It is not really that bad, but it could be better. Overall, buy this DVD still, (got it for 10$ at best buy). It is worth it, and being the fan that I am, I would have bought it anyways for collecting purposes. One song I wish they would have had though was The Glass Prison."
5,*** DT PURE JOY ***,"...uh, I think I blew my speakers on day one... specifically, the right speaker tweeter...oh, that is were JP is...IS ... OH MAN ... BUY THIS DVD!!!By the way, I appreciate those of you who want to try to compromise DT for their musicianship, too many notes....blah blah blah... BUT ... BUT ... BUT, you and ... oh forget it... if you have to ask ... you will never understand... you just want something different out of life and out of your bands...I DO NOT THINK THESE DUDES HEAR YOU :)The only thing that would warrant less than five stars is:1. Bonham or Peart NOT on Drums2. Hendrix NOT on guitar3. Geddy Lee NOT on Bass4. Rick Wakeman NOT on keysYes, Mr. LaBrie IS the X-factor...the GLUE and the SPECIAL SAUCE that binds this band together....what a JOY!!!!!!!DT PURE JOYGarbo"
4,Most bands can't lick these guys taints...,"The editorial review above pretty much sums it all up. Very talented musicians. Well done DVD. Even if you're not sure if you like these guys, this is worth seeing. Buy it."
4,Like Cheap Trick...DT rocks Budokan,"This is a great prog rock DVD. I even enjoyed the Train Wreck of Thought songs being that they picked the best from that cheesy CD. The band sounds tight and the song choice is right on. Portnoy is a phenom and Rhudess is unique on the keys. Myung is incredible on the bass and reminds one of RanBroad of the late 80s in the prog band Hoax. One star docked for the endless wankarama disease that haunted the Hoax in the Miter Vaque ERA. But, overall, I think this is a fine DVD and it passes my rather strict guidelines on DVDs. The bottom line is that this is entertaining. ""As I am"" starts the show well highlighted by Hollow Years and some great moments from the classic ""Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence""."
5,Fantastic DVD!,"If you are a Dream Theater fan you have to get this DVD! I got it as a gift and have thoroughly enjoyed it, the quality of the visual and the sound is incredible and the thing plays for a long time. It has a lot of bonus features so a lot to watch or even just play and listen."
5,Essential for Dream Theater Fans,"The first time I saw this DVD, I was totally blown away by how amazingly professional Dream Theater is as a Live group. The performance leaves absolutely nothing to be desired.The production quality is outstanding--a big improvement over the Scenes From New York DVD. The bonus features are awesome, and the Tour Documentary is really cool. The one thing I noticed about rig rundowns is that they didn't demonstrate any sounds and Petrucci never got very specific about the pedals he was using or even amp settings, so if you're a musician, you might find the demonstration lacking somewhat.Other than that, this DVD sounds great and looks great. They play a bunch of songs off Train of Thought as well as many others making for about a 170-minute run time. If you like Dream Theater, you will love this DVD!"
5,What a great band!,"I think that the concert came out looking and sounding amazing. James LaBrie sounds great on this one and even Mike Portnoy impressed me to a point singing-wise. The songs all sound great just as I hoped and ""Instrumedley"" is completely jaw dropping. The fact that they took many of their awesome instrumental sections from at least 7 songs and combined them all into one song was a great idea and it came out sounding so good and entertaining. My one little complaint is Jordan Rudess's keyboard leads in the Instrumedley sound a little too quiet, especially the ragtime piano solo in the second Dance of Eternity section but that may just be me because I love that part.Also, the variety on this DVD is great. They took songs from all 8 of their studio albums as well as 2 Liquid Tension Experiment songs and they're all in one concert!! Nice touch. The extra features are entertaining, although I do miss the band commentary. Anyways enough with me rambling, amazing DVD!!! Buy it now!"
2,Commodore Knockoff,"The main sample is stolen from an 80's video game on Commodore64. The game is called ""Lazy Jones"" and the track is ""Stardust"". There are a few websites with samples, but I give credit where credit is due, the makers of the Commodore videogame. Catchy lil tune."
3,good movie except lousy ending,"This would have been a very interesting movie - addressing very neatly what the appeal was of the Charles Boyer-look-alike, which was a mystery to reviewers of other movies based on the real story of the Lonely Hearts Club killers. I liked this movie except for the ending, which (a) departs from the real story upon which the movie is based, and (b) seems to me a very awkward edit to make the story end after X number of minutes despite great injury to the story or plot.I deleted the paragraph in which I say what the ending was, since 0 of 1 people found my review helpful, perhaps that was the unhelpful part. And yet this review was popping up as the most helpful critical review despite others rated more helpful and more critical, so go figure ... maybe a little glitch.The rest of what I would have to say is already covered in the previous 5 reviews. I googled the Lonely Hearts Club Murders and read with interest Mark Gado's 23 page article. (small pages)"
3,Good for Baby Boomers only,"For those of us born after the events of October 21, 1967, the book is a disappointment. Mailer fails to offer better explanations of important characters that were icons of the late '60s. Since I was born after that, I have no inherent knowledge of the hippie idols, etc. In this 'history as novel', Mailer fails miserably at what most great novelist excel: character development."
2,Give me a break.,"This should be called ""Norman Mailer's Midlife Crisis."" While some of his observations are interesting, they're not interesting enough to make it worth listening to all his whining."
1,political humor? or hell for a reader,"the writing of this book in a 3rd person view was a bad enough idea, but the story itself is boring, he takes 30 pages to explain speeches he makes, blah!"
2,Never received product,"I will never know how good the item is, because I never received it. I was given a fairly speedy refund, however, so I will give the service at least two stars. Very disappointing, though, because it was meant to be a birthday gift. Doubt I will use any of Amazon's third party distributors again, they just don't communicate."
1,Let the buyer beware!,"Big rip off. I got the cable to work one time and that was it, after that no matter what I tried, or downloaded or reinstalled the product was not supported. I am going to buy the expensive one now, how do you spell ""caveat emptor"" let the buyer beware?"
3,Regular cable,The performance of the product is intermitent but work. The original Nokia cable also work intermitent in my computer. So I can't judge.
4,Not bad for a generic product.,"At first I was skeptical about buying a generic product, but at that price I though I'd give it a try. I had a little trouble getting it started. I wasn't sure if it was a computer, software, or phone problem. After a while it worked, and really well. I haven't used all of the features yet, just the photo download. I like it so far. If you just want to download the photos from your phone then it's a pretty good buy."
1,Cheap imitation,"Don't waste your time with this product. The cable is a low quality knockoff of the Nokia OEM cable. The software would not allow my 6103 Nokia to connect to the PC. It kept telling me the driver was not properly installed. I tried reinstalling several time without success. To top it all off the cable end broke off in my phone, and I had to dig it out with a dental pick. Do yourself a favor and spend the 50 bucks for the Nokia cable and save yourself the aggravation,,, I wish I did"
1,Doesnt fit the Nokia 6102 phone,This item does not fit my Nokia 6102 phone even though it is advertised as doing so. Dont waste your money.
1,complete suckiness,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This product is a pile of junk and completely worthless.
1,No Can Do Cable,I was not able to get this cable and software to work. Kept getting an error. I guess Nokia phones dont work with generic CA 42 cables. I am using the email facility from my phone to transfer my pix from phone to pc.
1,Sucked,This didn't work with my phone. Cheaper is appealing but not better in this case. Buy the original if you want to link your computer with your phone.
3,Nokia data cable,"My wife's Nokia phone, for whatever reason could not be set up to transfer photo's to our PC.We ordered the cable in hopes that would allow us to retrieve the photo'ds- but no such luck.We have returned the cable to the vendor, and have been issued a credit. We REALLY would wantyed the pictures-"
4,Makes you think--expand your horizons,"From the look of it, one would expect this to be a dull, dry, academic book, but it's really a lot of fun. Auerbach quotes extensively from the books you probably always meant to read and uses them in a meaningful and entertaining way. His point is that over the last three thousand years or so, the West has changed the ways in which it views reality--and that the ""modern"" viewpoint is not necessarily the only way in which the world can be presented. Good book!"
4,Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature,"Although Auerbach wrote Mimesis 50 years ago, and a great deal of research has been produced since then, his book is still a masterwork, and provides many valuable insights for a range of texts. I highly recommend this book."
4,an elegant classic,"The first essay in Mimesis, 'Odyessus' Scar' is a brilliant, clear statment about the origins of what we define as Western civilization. Auerbach does not speak to our post-colonial times, but he does speak for the heritage that both binds and divides us. His writing and thinking are superb, clear, masterful."
3,A lot of mini and tri-cards,An okay box. Didn't know what to expect. A lot of mini-cards and tri-rookie cards.
5,Excellent Reference - A DEFINITE KEEPER!,"Very easy reading and gets right to the point. Microsoft claims to have re-written the source code for SQL 7 as well as a great deal of the interface features, this book cuts to the chase. Our firm has been working with MS SQL Server since 4.2 and we consider this book to be a MUST READ for all of our serious clients. We have a roll-out of a new version of software later this year, for which the database is SQL Server 7.0 and definitly plan to include this book as part of the upgrade package."
3,Very brief in everything. An introduction book,"This book describes a lot of things (if not everything) about SQL Server, but very brief on every point. I really can not learn how to use SQL Server from this book. It is an introduction book."
1,I'd rather slowly carve open a vein with a dull spoon.,"The problem with this book is that about mid-way through the book, it seems to become unaccessible. I am a beginner at SQL 7, and about halfway through the book, it started really bogging down, to the point where I was not getting anything from reading at all. I would of been better putting the book under my pillow, I couldn't have done any worse after all. Sorry to those who rated this book a 5. It does not deserve it in any sense of the word. And with this, my flame will cease."
5,Good for every dog owner,I love this book. I ordered one for my dad who adopted a puppy as well. It has everything from basic to in depth info.
3,A must have album,"This album is a must have if you like a compelation of new and old music. certain parts of the songs will get you up and going when your down in life,the other parts of songs will mellow you out.2 of the best songs off this album are Step Into The Sideshow & Rope. The first time I heard them on the radio I like it from the start to the end of the album. They sound a little bit like a mix of Drowning POOL & Slipknots first album. I think these guys will make it pretty far in the industry. I wish these guys would come around The Columbus or Indianapolis area I would go and watch them."
4,Pretty good cd...but it's still nu-metal,This CD is one of nu-metal's best. If you're into nu-metal you'll really dig this. Step Into the Sideshow is an awesome song. If you're looking for something a little heavier check out Trivium's new CD Ascendancy.
2,give me a break,"ultraspank did almost the exact same thing with their cd PROGRESS almost 3 years ago. this cd has 1 good song-step into the sideshow, and 1 decent song-fallingdown. If you wanna hear the original stuff go buy PROGRESS, or go buy American Head Charge instead.Anything but 40 below summer."
4,"A great CD, check these guys out.","Heavy as hell yet still melodic, I know this sounds like every other CD that's come out this year but 40 Below Summer do it in a way like no other. I nearly fell out of my chair listening to ""Step Into The Sideshow"", and simply love ""Falling Down"". There are a couple songs on the album I don't like, but the ones I do like, I love. Give them a listen."
2,this is no good,"this cd kind of tricked me because i had heard a song or two on sampler discs and thought it was alright, but when i got the album, only about three songs in the middle of the cd are almost good and the rest is generic nu-metal unoriginal boring ...BR>i wouldn't recommend this ..."
4,"3,5 actually",You could classify this band under standard nu-metal but this album shows some great potential. And they've added something new to the nu-metal sound. As far as I know they are the first band who uses acoustic guitars in their heavy songs. Only because of this i would give them some credit.Too bad the songs can't keep your attention all the way through but that can be adjusted in the future. I would like to mention the great vocalist (Max illidge) who mixes chino moreno's screaming/singing with Zach de la Rocha's rapping.
4,Good stuff.,"I really thought this cd kind of blew when I first gave it a listen...but then like all good cds it started to really grow on me. The singers voice became really intoxicating and I started to appreciate the songs a bit more. If your looking for a really heavy band to listen to with head crunching vocals and guitars, pick this one up. Pay close attention to Rope, Falling Down, and Power Tool. Not to mention their live shows are killer, I was able to catch them with Ill Nino and Coal Chamber."
3,Very Good,"When I bought this cd, it was 90% because they have a lot to do with one of my favorite bands. But lets leave them out of it. I was slightly afraid of getting it because of its rap metal influences. Let me just tell you something, THIS IS NOT RAPMETAL. The vocalist is by far the best black (metal) singer I've ever heard. His screams pierce your mind with the same valitity as Jonathan Davis used to, and Corey Taylor continueosly does. The only part of the band I have a problem with is the lack of originality and lyric. Nothing really inspiring about either of those subjects. But nonetheless, a GREAT debut album. I hope they manage to do well."
1,it's no good,"this cd kind of tricked me because i had heard a song or two on sampler discs and thought it was alright, but when i got the album, only about three songs in the middle of the cd are almost good and the rest is generic nu-metal unoriginal boring ...BR>i wouldn't recommend this ..."
3,"Good, but lacking.","Quick review of 40 below summer,.. being a listener of many bands from Metallica '83, Pantera '90 etc. to Tool '92, Korn '94 etc. Slipknot '99, Mudvayne '00 etc. This group sounds like they are trying to set themselves up there with the big dogs, right off the bat the songs sound good and heavy, the intros keep you wanting more but if your a deep listener and like complex drumming and original guitar riffs the songs start to fall apart, they sort of go all over the place (""Rejection"" is a good example). Im not a drummer i do play a little guitar but it sounds like amateur drumming compared to what im used to listening to and thats the big let down with these guys for me. but if your ready for a loud sound and tearing vocals its a keeper. Id say these guys have one up on primer 55. Most satisfying song ""Power Tool""."
4,Invite me to the Dance,"There are really no words to tell you how much I love this album. When you first pick it up you expect the music to be too much, almost like a hardcore band, but that's not the case. I'm not sure how to explain it. I like loud music, but not to much of it all at once, and this album satisfy's that. ""Falling Down"" is the perfect example of what 40 Below is really all about. It's loud, but than gets mellow and then loud again. I can't compare it to any other band, because they don't sound like any other band I've heard. They are their own sound. Just check it out, garateed that it won't disappoint you."
5,Carole King's Songs of Long Ago CD,"This is a great CD for those who loved Carole King's Tapestry LP and her work within the decade.Great sound, and a great collection."
1,I never got this product!,Money was taken out of my account for this CD. The product has a deadline of arriving by December 8th.
5,Hands-on power tips,"I was fortunate enough to attend a seminar where Troy Korsgaden was one of the presenters. This book is a direct take on the presentation he made. He makes a very compelling case for how to grow your agency. I know it isn't what some of us want to hear. Who wants to bother with hiring other people? What the author says is that if you want to grow your agency, you must duplicate yourself by training others to perform most, if not all, duties that don't involve direct selling. And guess what? Sometimes even that function can be handled by your staff.Troy Korsgaden's one-man agency managed 1,500 policies after all of nine years in business. With his current setup - including eleven employees - has a growth rate of 750 policies a year. I know, that isn't the goal of some of us in this business. However, his message is that if you really want to grow, there are no shortcuts. Hiring staff is not optional, it is absolutely necessary. Great book. Easy to read and to the point."
5,Step by Step Instructions to Grow Any Agency,"I've been in the insurance business for over 15 years. Why oh Why didn't I have this book when I started? The Best instruction book on how to grow Any size agency I've ever read. Troy's been on our side of the desk, had our struggles, same line from upper management, etc. Very good insight PLUS all the scripts one needs to put his program in place in My office! Amazing. The ""E-Myth"" for the Personal Lines insurance agent. Whether you are brand new or a ""Vet"" you will take many things out of this book that you can implement immediately and make more money."
2,Not enough real substance,"The book has a few tidbits of valuable info. Very basic, very simplistic. For example, set goals. Wow. Really? Insightful. Hire a great team. Wow. Powerful stuff. Have your CSR make tons of appointments for you. Again, wow. I was pretty disappointed. I was not expecting a magic bullet, but I was expecting more than I got."
3,CSR is the key,"I wish the author would of talked a little more about the ""system"" of an agency and not just ""hire a CSR"" as the key. He was very postivie in his words but not as informative to commission splits and hiring new ""sales people"" for the agency."
4,We all could use some good ideas,"Book was a good read, but ... production of book itself (the small type-style compared to the available page size) was below the level I would expect from a book, even a paperback book selling at this price. The content was still worth it, but thought the production values could have made it better!"
4,"If you read Oprah, read this","I definitely recommend Kathleen Rooney's book. What is especially compelling about her approach is how she mirrors the strengths and weaknesses of OBC in her own critique. Like Oprah, she dares to walk the dubious lines between the academy, mass media, and personal commentary, risking scrutiny on all fronts. And also like Oprah, she pulls it off with confidence and humor. I appreciate Rooney's struggle to be an authority and critique authority, which is why it's perfect that she includes a healthy dose of self disclosure and makes room for her own assessments of Oprah's picks. Most importantly, perhaps, Rooney makes the point that OBC is a woman-fronted effort and it's women readers who are changing the what, who, and how America reads."
3,Too Techno,its cool...its diffrent ...the transition phase from killer gothig metal to weird elctonica thing/band...now dont get me wrong i like the new stuff too but this is almost to tecno..and i hate tecno...call it for colectors only
2,"Scratchy on one side, synthetic on the other.","Sorry to say this blanket is not very nice. I love the idea but the organic cotton side is a thin scratchy flannel, not at all soft or smooth. The other side is a synthetic satin that looks a great deal cheaper quality in real life than in the photo. The color is not silky smoky green but rather a very slimy polyester lining kind of fabric in spring green. I don't get it at all. What's the point of an organic side when the extremely unorganic satin side is the only one you'd want next to your newborn's skin?"
5,Awesome,"My little boy loves this book. It's fun, clever, educational, and something different than all the other boring board book, hard book, paperback kids books in my library. This is one I actually like to read, and we do a whole row row row your boat theme with it. He just had a speech eval and these pictures are identical to the ones he was questioned on. Perfect detail. Don't know why anyone could give it a low rating, that is, assuming they're not dumbing down their kids learning enviro."
1,lackluster illustrations and CD,"The CD features one of the worst children's music recordings I've ever heard, and that's saying a lot, since there's a lot of dreck recorded for children. The pictures are engaging on the cover, but the pages are too densely illustrated and have too much of a sameness color-wise to make out the different items and cutaways. As each page is turned new vehicles are revealed, but not much seems to really change in the scene. This is not one of those books that can entrance toddlers with the illustrations, then keep them interested for years as their reading gains traction. Yet I don't think the text, which is just the song repeated, will engage a 7 year old for very long either. A disappointment (and provoked my first Amazon review)."
4,Cute book,"My son likes this book, although I think that he is more entertained by the holes rather than the pictures."
2,Down by the Station,"This is a great book, but the Kindle edition is missing all of the pictures that support the text. Since this is a book you sing with your child, the visual cues are a key element. Song can be found online. Buy the actual book rather than the Kindle version."
3,Transportation,"This book would have been better in a larger size like some of the other ""Books With Holes"". I can see were a boy may like it a lot due to the transportation theme. My grand-daughter and I thought it was OK."
2,prefer other books in this series,"first off, this is not a board book like others in the series. little readers who have grown used to putting their fingers and more into the holes in other books in the series will simply tear the page in this one. the variations on the song are fine-- fun to do even more if you have a little one who loves vehicles of all kinds. nothing truly awful about this book, just nothing special."
2,transformers rule BUT......,"Aramda season one sucked!!!! the series only got good during the end of the second season,I probebly will end up getting the box set but other than that I won't buy this single disc...if you like annoying BRATS standing around watching robots barely hitting each other thanks to political correctness then you would like this disc that doesn't even go anywhere..4 episodes that tell the same story get's kind of dull after awhile if you like gen1 and beastwars you'll hate this one,except the second season...stay away from this and get the box set when it's released.."
4,Not all instructional,"I do like this product because of the pole moves in it, they are impressive but the harder ones toward the end are not explained :(. The fire poi part shows you the very basics and goes over safety and such for a WHILE. The contortion is interesting as well but neither exercises to get to that point were explained nor how to do the moves themselves. It's a good dvd if you have a lot of experience or to set goals. Don't buy for the fire though unless you want extreme beginner and your not a fast learner."
4,Just Like The Picture,"This is a pretty pendant that seems to be very good quality. I ordered several items because of special deals that amazon had running. All my orders were placed on the same day, from various dealers. The reason why this pendant got 4 instead of 5 stars is that all the items from this company arrived nearly 2 weeks after all the other items I ordered. It seemed very slow to me. I guess I have been spoiled by amazon's normal delivery time.On the plus side, if you are patient, the quality is very good from this company. It may be well worth the extra wait time."
4,Brilliant,"This CD is really brilliant. It has been a long time ago for me, hearing such a wonderful sound. You will LOVE it"
4,Supergirl,I saw the video on German television when I was just over in Europe and it pulled me in. Almost a mix of the Church and early REM along with some contemporary Peter Gabriel. I hope they make the leap across the pond.
5,Great buy,I got these to beef up my Jato. They worked well and lasted much longer than the regular plastic arms. I would definitely recommend these.
4,A great soundtrack for a great film,"Sadly, this soundtrack, as with the movie, is very unrecognised. This soundtrack is an excellent attempt by composer Marc Shaiman.The pieces are flawless and well constructed. Marc Shaiman's technique here was very original: he composed romantic peices but played them slightly off key, creating a very groovy/darkly romantic/terrifying soundtrack.The ONLY problem with this truly brilliant piece of work is that s is not really recorded brilliantly. Several recording errors and layer transitions are painfully evident...especially is listening to it with headphones.But apart from that, i would recommend this CD as a fabulous and very haunting soundtrack that will stay with you forever."
3,So-so Brazilian teenybopper pop,"Jose Roberto was a lesser light in Brazil's teen-oriented ""jovem guarda"" rock scene... These mid-tempo pop ballads are pretty monotonous. The original release dates for these two albums were 1968 and '69, for ""Jose Roberto E Seus Sucessos"" and ""Jose Roberto E Seus Sucessos 2"", respectively. It's nice that Sony re-released these albums, but I'm afraid there's little here to capture the imagination of modern audiences."
5,Good idea for a trip!,"I love her books, you can fairly see the place and meet with the people. Especially in the winter, when the days are short and dark her books will transport you far away, to places more uncomfortable than your own....."
4,Pleasant and non irritating to the skin,I was impressed by the fast service! It took me awhile to locate the this product. In fact I wasn't sure if I was able to purchase it since it is used commercially in a local grocery store. I love the smell...very pleasant and soft to the hands. My hands feel moisturized after washing them. It would be nice not to have the antibacterial chemicals in the soap. I believe that regular washing of the hands is sufficient to keeps germs from spreading.
5,FINALLY!,"I hunted everywhere for liquid Safeguard Soap after having used it in a public restroom to wash my hands. I couldn't find it anywhere in any store - including WalMart - until I thought of Amazon.com. If it's to be had - Amazon will have it! I got it quickly, well packaged, and just as I remembered it. I still love it."
4,Took My Heart,"Beautiful! This group has a talent for both lyric and voice. I first heard ""Take My Heart"" in Germany, and bought a copy immediately. Nor was I disappointed! The sweet song of a man who'd rather loose his life than his love is copied directly from the radio version on the first track, then re-made on two others. The song is half English, half German--good for lovers of both languages. For a final treat, Band Ohne Namen includes ""Boys,"" a more upbeat song with the same direct, honest lyric style. Both songs are beautifully made, perhaps the best Germany has to offer."
1,Mr. Partsch is Correct,"I also had the experience of this game failing to run past the title screen, just before the menu should come up. Thank you Mr, Partsch for letting us know that Activision's customer service is as competent as their product testers. And yes, my computer meets the specs required to play the game so buyer beware!"
1,Damaged,"Product didnt even install at all, so what a waste of money. Tried to install it, the install wasn't even listed in autorun and had to do it from inside cd file but it said cabinet file is corrupted"
5,It's Okay,Reminded me of Max Payne. Only Max Payne was a lot better than this. I can't complain about this one it was fun to play and had me hooked until I finished it.
2,"nice idea, but...","The concept of easy 3-ingredient meals is good, but....If you're a picky eater like me, forget about it. I don't like onions, tomatoes, peppers, salmon....or many of the other things that take part in so many of the recipes in this book. When you've only got 3 ingredients to work with, substituting with foods I like doesn't go quite as far.And unless you live in a city, also forget about it. Sorry, but I don't have access to ""grape leaves packed in brine,"" or ""bresoala"" (is that supposed to be jerky? I had to look it up), salmon caviar, sturgeon, or a local fishmonger who will shuck my clams for me. I don't even have a natural-foods store in my town, which is a MAJOR requirement. The nearest one of those is an hour and a half away or more.I had hoped that since this book boasts ""simplicity"" so dramatically, that I might find it a little easier to make low carb meals. I was mistaken and I returned the book."
3,They can't all be corkers!,"This story is so straight forward it's almost boring.Longarm knows who he's after,a few fights,a bit of gunplay and without much fanfare it's all wrapped up.Very little in the way of a good plot,character development,historical or anything about the country.Longarm takes quite a beating,and that is about the highlight of the story.This is not one of those great Longarm stories that would lead a new reader to want to read more.Oh well,I've got a pile of Longarm's to read ,and I am sure there'll be many good ones ahead."
4,Inspiring Book,"This is the story of how God used a man of faith to bring Christian television to Chicago. The ""impossible"" (with man) dream became possible because of the miraculous interventions of God. The details are given in this account. The author tell us, ""It was a God-given vision, and He would put the wheels in motion Himself.""The balanced perspective his wife brought to the table is included. He describes her as being a pragmatist. We're told, ""She became the economist of the family, the realist, the pragmatist. She didn't need to be a dreamer because she married one."" He adds, ""I was fifty-two years old, with no experience whatsoever in television."" Carr tells us that a ministry born in faith and sustained in faith must progress in faith also.Writing further about faith, he says, ""By faith we realize the dream, we accept the challenge, we shoulder the burden. By faith we reach beyond our own circle and grasp the impossible."""
2,Looks better than it is...,"The price on this is just right and the pictures make it look awesome. The quality of the suede is good, impressive even, but the construction of the knob on the whole is cheap and flimsy. Other than the suede covering, it's made entirely of plastic. It's far too light, you can feel the cut-rate construction while shifting gears, and I really don't the think the fit and finish of the plastic would hold up under daily use for even a year.It's too bad. The suede is nice and the shape and size are perfect. Pay a bit more and get a better knob. This one looks nice, and even feels nice, but I wouldn't trust it's long-term durability."
5,A Bargain Buy,Some nice Hawthorne shorts for a low low price. What more can you ask for? It's a bargain and a fine read.
4,Good Condition,"This product came on time, was in good condition and inexpensive. My school bookstore wanted me to pay twice as much as I paid at Amazon. Save your money and buy this book at Amazon."
2,Lame,Lame book. It was a torture to read for someone who's not a fan of Puritan or Puritan-derived morality/philosophy (even that which is a reaction to it).
2,Can print vividly...however inconsistently!,"I have the Lexmark X83(all in one)and it is fabulous--the ink cartridges are EXPENSIVE, the resolution iffy at best, I mainly do photo and art printing, and quality of print is VERY dissapointing: either too dark or washed out! Can't capture those ""baby blues"" about 75% of the time! I waste valuable time printing test copies on regular VS photo paper to avoid wasting the latter...Lexmark doesn't address issues E-mailed or called in! The cartridges vary also in amount of copy resolution (from less than 2 days of printing to over 1 month)! What's up with that? Hello LEXMARK! Anyone out there? Its's frustrating to say the least...GO U.S.A.!!"
1,price and color,"I also have run into the problem that the yellow runs out first. Also after installing a new cartridge the yellow still wouldn't work. After many cleanings and lots of wasted red and blue and black, I gave up and I have purchase another one as I had a project deadline I had to meet. Who knows if this one will work. This is ridiculous! The price is very prohibitive, considering all I need is yellow. Is there a yellow refill kit? There should be."
2,lexmark off the mark,"I OWN A LEXMARK X83 . IT IS A GOOD MULTI- FUNCTION PRINTER BUT -you need a higher resolution printer to print good photos.A MAJOR DRAW BACK IS THE PRICE OF THE INK CARTRIDGES !! Had I researched a lot better, I would not have purchased a Lexmark.I AM PLANNING TO REPLACE THIS ONE WITH A HP ALTHOUGH IT IS ONLY 8 MONTHS OLD. THIS ONE IS JUST TOO EXPENSIVE TO USE. LEXMARK NEEDS ''GET ON THE MARK'' --INK SHOULD NOT BE THIS EXPENSIVE OR HARD TO FIND!!"
1,Poor performance,"I have purchased several of these cartridges over the past year. Despire minimal use, they invariably run dry. The Lexmark 'Clean Cartridge' function does not fix the problem, and only serves to waste my black ink cartirdge."
1,Not worth the money,I wish now I had spent the extra $10 and bought a new one at my local K-Mart. This cartridge leaves streaks throughout and the colors look washed out. Maybe I just received a bad one but I will never buy a refurbished cartridge again. My advice is not to waste your money.
3,Can't Wait to Ditch this Printer!,"Yes, the Lexmark Z51 was a GREAT buy---they really hooked me in with the $... price tag. But now I've invested ten times that amount in cartridges and I'm finished throwing my money away. Yes, it's a decent quality, but way too pricey, as many others have agreed. My next printer won't be a Lexmark, primarily due to the cartridge prices."
1,Junk,"Even through it was stated this product would work with my printer, it did clog right away. I am going to stay with OEM ink from now on."
2,Basically empty,"The ink cartridge was sent from Quantum Electronics and lasted one page before it started streaking and giving out. The cartridge was in the original pouch, but without a box, and is basically empty. What a disappointment for my first Amazon purchase."
1,Total Waste of Money - Don't bother,I suppose this ink is worth what I paid for it - which is very little. It's not much better than the one I replaced. Already blue is faded with lines. Won't purchase from this vendor again.It's two months later and I have to reorder.
1,lexmark ink cartridges,This product didn't work didn't have an return packing slip I just keep buying from the store where the return policy is very simlpe
4,Good quality color catridge,The quality of this product is very good. I have purchased discounted cartridges before and they didn't work well in my all in one printer. This works great and the price is lower compared to retail stores in my area.
4,Lexmark Color Cartridge,"Although Lexmark cartridges are a bit pricey, they produce high quality color images. I have been very satisfied with both my Lexmark Z42 printer and the color cartridge."
5,Accurate description,"These seeds are just what they say they are. I planted them at the beginning of the growing season and they came up beautifully and grew all summer. I am waiting to see if they will come back up again this spring. If not, there are plenty of seeds left to plant some more."
3,Gatekeeper review,"I think Archer Mayor is a GREAT writer/ storyteller, but this was too much of a throwaway effort, as if the author wanted to make a pseudo-politacal statement, not write a great addition to his Joe gunther exploits"
5,Excellent Album!,"Just as the first album is good from song to song, this album is consistently great from song to song as well. The melodies are so catchy. Every song rocks, whether in a clear-cut in-your-face kind of way, or in a pretty, soft kind of way, or both. And there's a reason ""Idiot"" gets mentioned the most; it's the best song on an album full of best songs. It's perfect for anyone who absolutely loathes another person (deservedly so), which most of us know that feeling well. Keep 'em coming Lisa!"
5,DAD_78,"I am satisfied with my cd, What Else can i Say...It is just perfect ... Great Deal ... +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
5,Lisa Rocks,"I did not think I would like this CD. THen I listened to it and thought this CD is so hot. I love it I can relate to her drama. She lets us know her life is not perfect like allot of other stars, she gives us the yeah My bleep stinks just like everyone elses attitude. I love it."
2,Not Bad,"This CD is not bad. It is not terrible but it is also not as good as I thought it might be. There were a couple of remake songs that she sang that were pretty good. Therefore, I will listen to it again but not in the near future."
5,Now What!!! Can't Wait For What's Next!!!!,"This CD is one of the best, most powerful CD's I have ever heard, Lisa Marie Presley has a very unique voice, and may soon become one of the greats!, like Shania Twain, or Christina Aguilera, and her songs are so original and so different, they have such an edge, even though her first cd was good, this one is sooo much better. She is already my 2nd fave singer, lol"
5,"EXCELLENT WORK LISA, CONGRATULATIONS FROM MEXICO","EXCELLENT WORK !!!!IT'S A BETTER WORK, THE MUSIC IS GOOD. I'M SURE LISA ALREADY FOUND THE ROAD TO REACH A NUMBER #1, I WISH HER A LOT OF LUCK BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THE SHADE OF ELVIS PRESLEY AND MANY TIMES PEOPLE JUDGE WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THE DAUGHTERS AND SONS ALSO HAVE TALENT. GOOD LUCK!!HOW IT'S YOUR DESIRE, IT'S YOUR WILL"
5,Standard of excellence continues..,"LMP's second cd is not a disappointment..this much awaited follow-up to""To Whom it May Concern"" is a great gift to her already established fans and to those new fans who will love this cd! She is a remarkable songwriter--"
3,She Not Elvis,"Unfortunately the poor girl has a very tall shadow to get out of. Yes she does have her own style and that is what she was wanting. She has said many times that the songs she writes come from her life's experiences. Once she gets a few more cds under her belt she will will be big. She isn't trying to replace her father and I have to believe Elvis would tell her ""your music has to come from with in you Lisa Marie"", Her music will change as did her father's, and of course there will be record sells just because she is the King's daughter. but there are many songs on her cds that are really good, Dirty Laundry for one. I plan to buy her music because she is good and a great person that has a good heart. she deserves to succeed. (Thanks for reading this, TCB-TX)"
1,"Talentless, Get Off Daddy's Coat Tails","Just because your dad was talented and famous, that doesn't mean you will be. This is something Lisa Marie should accept. Her voice just drones on and on and it sounds so flat and bland. She sounds like Sheryl Crow on a lot of downers."
1,Give It UP!,"This thing is just plain and simply.....awful. Believe me, if it weren't for her namesake, and she had been a ""nobody,"" taking this junk to any record company would have got her booted immediately. I'm sorry, but she can't carry a tune in a bucket with someone else carrying it for her. The success of this record has been due totally to media hype. I don't let anyone tell me what to like, and you shouldn't either.We thought Sheryl Crow was the most untalented person with a contract. Now, she has some steep competition."
5,"NOW WHAT? NOW, THE BEST CD OF 2005!","Lisa Marie Presley, rocks! Plain and simple. This new CD is a pure rock album with awesome singing, writing and great music. Lisa really worked hard on making this album great and she definitely pulled it off! This is one of those rare CDs that can be listened to track 1 through til the end without skipping tracks! They are all awesome!! I LOVE LISA MARIE PRESLEY!! One of the best female rockers out there today! No Lie!! And to all you doubters out there, LISA CAN SING!!!!! She has a great bluesy, rock voice that out shines Britney and all those teen pop ""stars"". Lisa is a true artist who knows music and knows it well. Lisa is here to stay! The stand out tracks on here are, ""I'll Figure It Out"", ""Dirty Laundry"" which blows Don Henley's version out of the water, ""Idiot"", ""Raven""(AWESOME!!} And ""Now What"" which she sings beautifully and it is a very pretty song with great lyrics. This CD speaks for itself, GET IT NOW!!!!"
5,I liked it!!!,"I wasn't very impressed with her album ""To whom it may concern"".I thought the music overpowered her voice. But I must say I really liked ""Now What"". I can actually hear her voice and the music is catchy. I like that she wrote most of her own songs. I like that she speaks from the heart.People need to stop comparing her to her father. They are two different people. Obviously she will never sing how he did. No one will. People just have to keep an open mind when it comes to her music. True she doesn't have to sing or do anything to support herself, shes set for life.. But the fact is she is actually doing something.....and its something she enjoys!I like that she pays credit to her parents in the cd booklet. She thanks them. She wrote a song about her mother... She even thanks her kids and expresses how much they mean to her...I say let her do her thing...."
5,FINALLY... GREAT NEW ROCK!,"When I first heard Lisa Marie Presley's 1st CD ""To Whom It May Concern"" ...It blew me away! I had not heard anything that real in a very long time. I love her voice and after the first song... I was hooked. The second CD ""Now What"" is even better and Lisa Marie is on my list of ALL time favorite songwriter/singers. I recently saw her LIVE and it was awesome!!...THANK YOU LMP FOR BRINGIN BACK THE ROCK (IN) ROLL. ...WE HAVE MISSED IT. *"
1,The Flying Nun,"Honestly, this dress made me look like a Nun, or a servant from the 1800's. The part that makes it look weird is the white section of the dress, it looks exactly the same in the front as it does in the back. From the side, it just doesn't look right with this pattern. I also felt it accentuated my ""pooch"". I really wish this dress was designed better because it is very pretty in the front."
4,pretty good,"this is one of the first science fiction books that i read. I must say i really liked it. I prefer the sci fi books with alot of action, and this book has just that. It is definetly worth reading."
5,Freckles cotton mat,"Love this mat. I wanted a different one I saw of Freckles, the one with the turtle on it, but Amazon does not carry it."
5,hip hop + classical music = Se tu vuoi,"They experiment with this two styles and just like in their preview single ""Bella Stella"" it works very well.highland are two rappers and a singer with a really beautiful voice.This single contains the radio version the non-rap mix, The extended version and the Club mix which is really good."
3,SEXY,"I love JCO, but this book is written for junior-senior high school readers. If you're looking for the author's level of complexities of characters, this is not the book for you."
3,Disappointed.,Not what I expected. Found it to be a difficult read.I should have checked up on it a little more before ordering.
5,Excellent Book,"I am not Jewish, but I love this book. Heschel has changed how I approach the Sabbath in a good way."
5,The Essential Philosphic Underpinnings of the Sabbath,"Rabbi Heschel begins by clearly explaining the basis of Shabbat - the island in time. Contrasting time and material posession (space), he shows the inherent joy in this most important Jewish holiday of all. It is not a Sabbath how-to book. Rather, it is for thoughful readers seeking the spiritual element in the day of rest. To them, Heschel's The Sabbath is truly an Oneg Shabbat. A must read."
5,Five plus and more stars you have,"This is positively the best book available for understanding the Judeo-Christian sense of time. Heschel starts with very simple observations e.g. that time/Sabbath was the first of God's creation to be blessed and called holy. From there using Scripture, traditional commentary, and his own wise observations he builds an understanding of the pivotal role Sabbath plays in Jewish life.The illustrations truly enhance the book - not essential but an indication of the care that has gone into this book."
3,Not for the uninformed Jew,"This book is not for beginners, or those who are relearning their heritage. This book is more like a dissertation, and assumes that the reader is somewhat of a Jewish scholar. More advanced for my taste. But it is ver informative, and perhaps one day I will reread it after I have studied Judiasm more thoroughly."
5,The Sabbath and Sacred Time,"The Sabbath (2005) is a genuine gem of a book. It is written to help explain the value and importance of the Sabbath, but in the process becomes a universal touchstone for learning about Sacred Time. The great philosopher Abraham Joshua Heschel has managed to write a book for the Jewish community that is as relevant to practitioners of different faiths as it is to Jews. The book is beautifully written prose, almost poetic in presentation."
4,Worth Reading,"For me, a Christian, this book is worthy of reading but not worthy of fully emulating. I did, however, glean several thoughts worth keeping, which appear in my Sabbath lecture. He does a good job with the concept of space and time: Man hunkering for the dominion of space/things, God consecrating time (think Sabbath), which in Heschel's view is a foretaste of eternity, and events. The modern world, is man's triumph over space. Time remains beyonds man's ability to conquer.Heschel sees Sabbath as ""palace in time,"" a carefully structured retreat from the hustle and bustle of the marketplace. For the Jew, the laws of the Sabbath, therefore, are the spiritual architecture with which the ""palace in time"" is built. While other religions have devoted their energy to building physical, sacred spaces, Jews have erected sanctuaries in the form of sacred days and the commemoration of sacred events."
3,Halfway through I knew who did it,"Halfway through I knew who did it, though I didn't know why. There were little hints here and there, but I thought the person was too obvious to really be the killer. Even still, I couldn't put the book down (read it in 2 days) but was disappointed with the end. I felt like Agatha Christie was bored with the book and wanted to end it as soon as possible, which is why she crammed so much information into the last Chapter of the book."
2,theres much better about..,"A very ordinary 'Poirot"".It was one of the last and the Belgium only features in about 30 pages in the entire story which revolves around a body found in a blind women's house in suburban England - not even an exotic location for this one.Even for Christie it was a stretch to tie it up at the end. There are much better ones about than this effort."
4,Poirot Saves the Day?,"I didn't realize that this was a Poirot mystery until he showed up. That was the happy surprise for me because I wasn't expecting him at all. Christie is, as usual, superb with the introduction of the crime and the cast of characters. She also gives enough clues for the reader to try to figure out the solution. I did feel that the solution was a bit rushed, but I wasn't disappointed."
3,"Creepy Murder, Less Creepy Conclusion","This novel begins with one of Christie's creepiest murder scenes. A young woman arrives at her employer's house to find an unidentified dead man and a room full of stopped clocks. The rest of the book is spend unraveling the mystery of the dead man's identity and his presence in the home. To complicate matters the homeowner is blind, so visual identification is impossible. Before the mystery is solved a young secretary is also murdered, likely in connection with the mystery man.I found the clues offered in this book to be far less subtle than in some of Christie's other mysteries. Indeed, the list of characters at the book's outset gives away a great deal. Ultimately I found the solution to the mystery to be rather odd. Suffice to say that it is very much a product of its time. This is not one of Christie's more haunting efforts, but the reading of it was entertaining nonetheless."
3,"Intriguing, at least until the end.","I picked up this book at the library, (mainly because of the title) and was a good read until the end. I found the solution disappointing and could have been much better considering the immense building of the plot. Still, it hasn't given me any reason to doubt Christie's writing ability, and was totally surprised in the revealing of the murderer."
4,PRETTY GOOD,this is the first agatha christie book i have read and i liked it alot.It was boring at times also it was very confusing but the ending was so good and the book was pretty good. I hope to read more agatha christie
4,Really good until the end,"First of all, the set up to this story is excellent: the dead man in the blind woman's house, the mysterious phone call luring the stenographer there under false pretenses and the use of the clocks of the title to throw the police and the reader off the track. But then Christie gets over complicated and tries to wrap things up too quickly and the story concludes on a confusing note. The characters however are all unique especially the ones in the neighborhood where the dead body was found but they're mostly there to distract you away from the real killer, whose motives seem overly complex.Poirot is regulated to background status here but as usual, he provides the most humor and enjoyment. Read for him and the supporting cast. The outcome sadly never reaches the same level as the great beginning."
4,Murder Most Timely,"We learn that Hercule Poirot has taken up the study of classic mysteries and his knowledge of these leads him to solve the mystery in this particular case.Colin Lamb, a young marine biologist and Intelligence agent, is paying a visit to Wilbraham Crescent when a young girl comes running out of one of the homes. She is screaming that she has found a dead man inside. Indeed, a corpse is there surrounded by a room filled with clocks set to 4:13, although it is only 3:13. Colin takes the problem to his father's old friend, Hercule Poirot, who at once pronounces it a ""simple"" case. Two more murders, an unidentifiable body, a mysterious secretarial school, and the search for a clever spy are the clues that Poirot's little grey cells must sift through before he reveals the answer to this ""simple"" case."
2,A clunker,"Trying to have some fun with one of mystery's typical conventions, Christie comes up with a clunker this time. Using a British spy, with the far too cute name of Colin Lamb, as the Hastings stand in; Christie has Poirot work from home in homage to John Dickson Carr's locked room mysteries. Crescent shaped neighborhoods, international espionage, a damsel in distress, and the titular clocks all come into play in this mess of a mystery that definitely needed more Poirot to make it palatable. Too many red herrings and the underlying combination of spying and romance sit uncomfortably together causing nothing more than annoyance for the reader. As it stands it doesn't so much entertain as bore and when all is resolved you are relieved as opposed to amused as you realize this one's finally over."
4,The Clocks,"I had always wanted to read ""The Clocks"" and now that I have I am a bit disappointed. Not that the story was bad, in fact it was very well done, there is a mystery element that you will not figure out, and a few red herrings thrown in for good measure. The only problem I had was that the book depicted that this was a Pirot novel, when in fact he was hardly in it. The protagonist would present Pirot the evidence and he would basically say if they were warm or off the mark. But other than that It was a fun read."
3,"Ehh, half decent live material","I basically bought this Extended Single for the live tracks, as i'm listening to them right now, the sound quality isn't up to snuff. Granted, its still cool to hear some live material, but i think LP should put some effort into recording their live material. Chester's vocals are a bit recessed and the dynamics sound a bit squashed. The bonus tracks sound fine and are very cool. I really can't recommend this cd to anyone, its simply not worth the price tag."
5,A must for all yoga lovers and an inspiration for others,"The book is very well written and beautifully illustrated. Extremely simple to understand. One of the only books with which you can chart out your own yogasanas,to suit your requirements.With the help of colors and codes it is very systematic, like having a teacher in person... a great gift to friends and family."
2,too small.,"the book is ok, but it is too just small for kids to like it, pictures are small. i h\was expected something like a regular size book."
3,Edited by ROBOTS!,"My daughter is 7 months old and seems to enjoy this book. It's colorful, padded and has loads of photos.I kind of hate it. It's like it was put together by robots. The images are cut rate stock photography and the word choices are odd. For example the pages with clothes have 8 pictures. They are coat (really a jacket), dress, pajamas, sweatshirt, pants, boots socks, hat. The PJ's look like the kind old men wear, not little kids. The boots are rain boots. And then the sweatshirt...not a sweater, a sweatshirt! Why? These are supposed to be essential words and they choose a sweatshirt over a sweater. ""Toys"" include pencils. ""Things That Go"" are vehicles. ""Bathtime"" is properly, Bath Time (right?) and includes the images of a weird white rubber duckie with rainbow racing stripes and the caption reads, ""duck"" instead of ""duckie"". Flip to ""Farm Animals"" and you find a photo of a duck with her ducklings, with the caption ""ducks"" as if they"
2,No Good,"The book was really small, I wish I would've known this. The books is long gone! I would recommend buying the large one."
3,Useful but not great for learning words,"We have found this book useful for our daughter (we got it when she was about 12 mos and she is not 16 mos) in terms of just having something big with clear pictures that she can look at. But I would say for learning words, it is not that great because many of the photos are not clear what they are. They could be multiple things so it's not clear to her what she should be focused on. I don't even try too hard to force her to learn the words through this because some of the photos frankly don't make that great sense vs how this could have been executed. Nice as a picture book but wouldn't say it's a great vocabulary trainer."
4,My daughter's favorite book!,"My 13 month old keeps bringing this book to us, wants to look at the pictures and hear the words, over and over! She loves it more than any book in her collection. I would give it 5 stars if all words/images were completely relevant - does ""guinea pig"" really need to be one of the few domestic animals included? Does anyone really use the term ""soft toy""? And the verbs are confusing because many don't look like action photos. But this is pretty minor considering how much fun our toddler has with this colorful book. Highly recommended!"
4,A Great Book,"I purchased this item for my 2 yr old son to work on his vocabulary and he has thoroughly enjoyed it. The book contains big pictures and large easy to read print. The only downside is that the book could use to be a little longer with more items. I would recommend this book to anyone hoping to improves their youngsters speaking, comprehension and vocabulary."
4,"Nice, but not as soft and I thought","The book is not hard, but not soft either. It has some soft material in it but, not as soft as I expected. Overall tho, it seems like a book my son likes me reading to him"
2,Not what I expected,"I do not like the pictures inside. The pictures look a bit outdated. I would not recommend this book, sorry."
3,Nice,"It's a nice thick , sturdy book . It is just a lot smaller than I thought. The baby enjoy the brightly colored pictures."
4,Great book,"I got this when my son was several months old. He liked looking at the pictures and pointing to them so we can read it for him. When he got older, it was his turn to say the words when we pointed at them. The pictures are very colorful and is organized in sections i.e. fruits, transportation, etc We just bought another similar book today for our second son."
5,baby girl loves it,"We got this for my daughter when she was about 8 months and she has loved it ever since. Now we can ask things like ""Where is the doggie?"" and she points to it with glee. I really like the progression of the book too... the first page is very simple, every day words. Then it moves on to ABCs, numbers, shapes, colors, times of day, opposites, etc. To me, this seems like a book that will keep her entertained and learning for a few more years even. The bright, realistic pictures help, since she is not really interested in anything animated at this point. She loves the pictures of the other ""babies"", or children, in the book. I would definitely recommend this, and we plan on getting more of the Bright Baby series of books."
1,not what I expected,"Did not expect a ""hard"" book, the pages were slick covered and extremely rigid. Expected soft puffy pages easy for a little one to grasp."
2,MOBILE????,"Haven't had babies around for a while but as I recall Mobile (as in hangs over crib) is NOT one of the first 100 words my kids learned....expected very basic words, not what's there."
2,small book,I should have read the dimensions but this book is small had to return too small for my 2 year old prefer the larger board book.
5,Great,I love this book for little ones to learn and recognize everyday things.However I am disappointed becauseI have not received the second book. It should not take almost 4 WEEKS to come from California. We cannot blame everything on the post office!
5,Over and over and over...,....is how we read this book to our granddaughter. She is 14 months old and loves the brightly colored pictures and is recognizing some of them by name. Highly recommended!
5,favourite book,"i gave this to my baby when she had maybe one or two words she could say. right away it was her favourite. we went from me saying the word and pointing. to me saying a word and her pointing to it. to me pointing and her saying the word. she take it to bed to look at it as she fell asleep and we've had to tape it back together so many times from it being so well used. she's turning 3 now and still loves it, but i think it's time to get a more advanced one for her and replace this one so her brother so he can love it just as much."
4,Great for babies,My 10 month old loves this book. It is very colorful and has great pictures. A great buy for us.
4,My Son likes it,Cute little book my son can take around and look for the different things in real life. He already knew a lot of the words in there which made him even more excited about the book.
4,Great book for toddlers,"This book is an obvious great choice for toddlers. My 15 mth old son likes to point at all the picures and flip through the pages. The book is pretty sturdy, which is great because he is hard on most things."
5,Can't Put it Down!,"My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday. She is now almost 18 months old. And it is consistently read/looked at every day (no exaggeration). As a matter of fact, early on, we used it to teach her names of various objects and now she gets them right about 95% of the time. She LOVES IT!!! I highly recommend it for all children!"
1,bad gift,"My daughter has received two versions of this book, both as gifts. She finds it compelling, maybe because it is so dense with images, but the images are all of a very low quality. The way the information is presented somehow reminds me more of television than books; it's an ugly onslaught of redundant images with text that in many cases could just as well be rearranged."
5,Great book for little learners,"I ordered this book from Amazon about 6 months ago and it has been such a big hit with my daughter, who is now 16-months-old, ever since we got it. She delighted in looking at the pictures from the moment it arrived, and is now able to point out most of the objects when asked to find them, so I consider the book to be a valuable educational tool as well as an entertaining picture book. I am not so excited about some of the pictures but my gal seems to love them, so, this book earns high marks. I would definitely recommend it to other parents or childcare providers."
5,Wonderful book,"My 19m son LOVES this book. It is the only one that he will sit down for more than 5 minutes, and he will bring it to me constantly. I will be buying another copy to keep at his sitter's. Best money I have spent for a book for him."
1,ugly book,"My daughter has received two versions of this book, both as gifts. She finds it compelling, maybe because it is so dense with images, but the images are all of a very low quality. The way the information is presented reminds me more of television than of books; it's an ugly onslaught of redundant images with words that in many cases could just as well be rearranged."
3,My book club loved it!,"We just read this book for our book club and the overwhelming grade was 8/10. Personally it wasn't one of my favorites, but that may have been because I am fairly familiar with the wild west - including round-ups and life on the land. I didn't feel that it ended with a solid conclusion, but have since learned that there are two sequels, which makes sense."
5,Great history,"Very interesting ,and true to the real lives of the cowboy.I purchased this book for my husband and he loved it."
2,Mediocre,"While this book does cover several aspects of banditry, it does not concentrate on one specific geographical area and therefore makes global conclusions. These conclusions are not always accurate, I feel."
3,"If you own the four TV series DVDs, you already own this one ...","A retelling of the highlights from the TV series with a different actor playing the Alan character (due to Richard Beckinsale's untimely death). With no laughing audience to play off of, these scenes make the characters appear to be just going through the motions. Someone must have needed to make their flat payments to justify taking my favorite English comedy and creating this poor film. At least I was reminded where and when I laugh while watching the TV series. If you need this for collecting purposes (like me) it's cheap enough to sit through once or twice to see great material and sets made mediocre. Otherwise spend your money on the four DVDs of the television series and see the genius that is Rising Damp, Leonard Rossiter and the entire cast of eccentric English characters. };>{>Rising Damp - Series 1Rising Damp - Series 2Rising Damp - Series 3Rising Damp - Series 4"
1,poor plaigarism,"There are the original actors cast as miss Jones, Philip, and Rigsby but Richard Beckensfield as Alan has been replaced by another actor as Seymour which considerably upsets the dynamics of the cast. So this is no longer a movie of the series. However it is annoying to hear the same dialogue and gags lifted word for word from the series. Clearly the movie was made to cash in on the series without employing the same script writer to come up with new ideas.This was not the case in ""Steptoe and son rides again"" which I highly recommend if you liked rising damp and another comedy set in a seedy dwelling with a conniving old dad and the fall-guy son.In some ways the movie out-shone the series. Not here just do not waste your time and money.Further more the claustrophobic back-drop complete with ugly wall-paper and fittings has been replaced by a cleaner airy house which loses the atmosphere from the series.Lazy plaigarism and not even one of the same leading actors."
2,English humor,"My British in-laws visit us every year for 4 months during which time I need to amuse them. I purchased this dvd for my father-in-law at his request. He had enjoyed the tv program of the same name in UK. He loved this movie and laughed out loud almost continuously. My mother-in-law smiled several times, and my husband and I winced. It is typical 70's humor, English style. If you like that kind of humor, you will love this dvd."
4,Great Music!,This is the first recording of David Chesky that I have purchased. Great music. Contemporary and modern sound without being inaccessible or hard to appreciate. In addition the acoustical quality of the recording is superb.
5,Wonderful,"This album should have been released months ago. Unfortunately, Julia's record company closed prior to it's original release date last year. Luckily, Vanguard Records have been quick to step in and the album will be released in the US in June. This album has already received glowing reviews from critics and I'm sure this will be Julia's most successful album to date. Infact, the word 'grammie' has been mentioned. Julia made her debut in the late eighties and has continued to produce quality albums throughout her career. Her voice is a musical instrument and her lyrics tell tales of lost love. The title track from her new album is a colaboration with soul queen India Arie. Other highlights are 'Roadside Angel' (a tribute to Minnie Ripperton) and 'Missing Man'. Julia's career is set to rise and rise. Rumour has it that Julia will be composing the music to David Lynch's next movie. She recently completed a successful short tour and will be making more appearances over the coming months."
3,"Good Heart, Superficial Mind","Kalle Lasn is adept at marketing. He's got flair with the shocking image and the powerful sound bite. However, he's not a great analytic thinker, and his glosses in CULTURE JAM often are superficial.His main points are valid ones, nevertheless, and much of his advice in the ""Summer"" section of the book is sound. His broadbrush dismissals of both feminism and The Left are not.This book is a quick read, has its heart in the right place, and certainly says much which is accurate about our American consumer culture and our obsessions with materialism and image. If you have never thought about how stupid it is to watch four or more hours of television per day, then this book is for you."
4,"No Bad. Worth reading, though.","Insightful? Yes. However, Lasn fails to really go in-depth into the problems of climate change, consumerism, etc. Yes, he covers an entire gamut of what will happen to us in the long run should human consumption continue at its current rate, but does so in a ""skim-the-subjects-and-touch-on-them-briefly"" sort of way. I'd still recommend reading it, though."
2,Didactic and dogmatic,"It was torcherous trying to finish this book. First, let me be clear, and say I agree 150% with the author's agenda and basic analysis. However, his choice of style demands too much from the reader. Long diatribes do little to engage the average reader that is unaware of the dominant social and political role that corporations play in our society. Instead of catch-phrases and cliches, the author would better serve the reader by dishing out a deeper analysis of the problem. Kudos to him for offering a plan of revolution, but he overestmates the future movements' powers and of his book. The rantings and raving of this author, although correct, are simply a detail in the larger problem of capitalism as practiced in America. I would avoid this book and read One World: Ready or Not for a better understanding of globalization and the cultural dominance of the corporation."
4,Monroe Air Shocks,Ordered a new set of Monroe Air Shocks for my van. When received it was noted that some of the parts were missing. Instead of sending them back I opted to purchase the parts locally. In contacting Amazon.com they proceeded to give me a rebate for the parts missing. All in all it turned out to be a good experience.
1,LOST DELIVERY / WRONG PART,FIRST THEY LOST MY ORDER THEN THEY RESHIPPED AND SENT ME THE WRONG MERCHENDISE HAD TO REORDER AND HAVE TO SEND THE WRONG PARTS BACK ...WAITING FOR NEW ORDER HOPING IT IS THE RIGHT PARTS
2,DISAPPOINMENT Compared to other Little Golden Books,"My 28 mos old loves to be read to. He will literally let me read book after book to him for an hour at a time. His favorite Little Golden Books are: Goodnight Little Bear, The Good Humor Man, Picture Dictionary, The Fire Engine Book and Animal Orchestra. I have no doubt these books have created a love of reading, expanded his vocabulary and sped up his talking (he was 3 months premature and had a slight speech delay). As for ""Lasso the Moon,"" the illustrations are cute, but it held no interest for him. He doesn't ask for the book by name, the story doesn't flow well off the tongue and isn't very interesting."
2,Not quite useless,"I got this keyboard at a time when money was tight and, well, you know the saying: You get what you pay for. Typing more than a few words on it was always aggravating, particularly because of the space bar. Hitting it with a normal amount of pressure often didn't work, but hitting it with more pressure usually resulted in two (or more) spaces between words.I bought this keyboard because, after we moved, I couldn't find the stock, corded keyboard that came with the computer (a Dell). After a couple of weeks of pulling out my hair with the ""Internet Pro"", I found the original keyboard and (gratefully) went back to it.The thing wasn't completely useless, but I'd be more inclined to use it to wedge open a door than as a keyboard. I would recommend that you buy it only if money or availability leaves you no other choices."
4,"Latest additon to the ""Freed from Death Row Genre""","It is a sad comment on society that when you cruise through Amazon books there seems to be a growing list of books about the wrongly convicted/freed from death row.Well this book is more than just the latest addition. It is a well reported and straightforwardly written story that should freighten us all. Jed Horme does a nice job of setting the stage in New Orleans by a well written background about the role of poverty and wealth in this racially diverse but also racially divided city.The author's writing is not overly suspenseful, nor does it overwhelm the story that is being told. it is straight forward and to the point allowing the story to move itself along through the many unusual turns of the case.Overall a good read and I also recommend ""A promise of Justice"" and ""Bloodsworth"" for those who enjoy this book."
1,Starts strong,Movie starts out pretty funny then takes a turn for the ridiculousness. I wouldn't waste the time...maybe watch 30 minutes then turn it off
5,Ernest At His Best,"As another Ernest movie is produced and brought out to the public it would seem that all the Ernest movies that have come out over the years that the funniness of each movie would start to lose its luster. Well it doesn't in this film, the same old jokes were still funny and the new situational humor makes the film even funnier as we keep up With the wacky weirdo Ernest in ""Ernest Goes To Jail"". A must see comedy film that is a must see for any age and people. I suggest this film to anyone who is in the mood for a good laugh and slapstick. This movie is one of my favorite Ernest movies."
3,Ernest,My son watched this movie over and over when he was very small. He is now a senior in high school and we still like to watch it. Ernest is so funny in all of his movies. Now I have grandbabies who like to watch him. Glad it is out on DVD.
4,"Hilarious, Classic Varney","Make no mistake, Jim Varney perfected the art of slapstick, and this movie has some scenes that are just downright funny. My daughter likes to watch this movie, and as many times as I have seen some of these scenes, I still laugh out loud. The 2 scenes where Ernest gets electrocuted and becomes magnetic are among Ernest's all-time best, and don't miss the episode with ink leaking from a pen he had in his mouth while on jury duty. Solid 4-star comedy."
4,Ernest Goes to Jail,This was the Jim Varny I expected. Slap stick comedy all the way but with a good story line. The family will enjoy this with a bowl of Popcorn.
2,Why can't we have the whole movie?,"OK, it always annoys me when a network channel has an exclusive cut of a movie with scenes not available on any version for sale. This was the case with ""Ernest Goes to Jail"" on TV and the original VHS edition. But this DVD version is cut even more than the original VHS release! Where's the scene where Chuck confesses how he bullied Bobby as a child? I dig this movie (four stars), but this DVD is a disgrace!"
2,ernest,"i order 3 Ernest movie from hasting at the same time. i received the frist 2 about 4 to 5 days later, but the 3rd was sent dayss later i dont know why they just dont shipped it all together to save time and money. makes no since to me"
3,je cherche,"Je cherche a copier ou acheter ce film en version franais, ( Ernest en prison) communiquer moi si cela est possiblesergus2000@hotmail.com"
5,"SMASHING! I LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Anyone who is getting married should definitely buy this book, my sister is going to give them to her bridesmaids along with some other trinkets........I saw Rebecca in People magazine twice! Along with other celeberties who have receyled there dresses also. What a great cause, too. My mother is a breast-cancer survivor and Rebecca surely is using her talents and her bridesmaids dreses to the best of her ability to help many cancer patients. Thank you Rebecca. Keep up the good work. I loved the scuba diving picture, it was my favorite! I would be honored to have a bridesmaid that was in my wedding use the dress that they wore(no matter how ugly), in such a wonderful way. How truly flattered the woman you wore this dress for must be. She sure is lucky to have a friend like Rebecca! Keep up the great work."
5,A must for anyone who has EVER been in a bridal party!,Rebecca Whitlinger is hilarious! This book is a perfect and light-hearted gift for any wedding-related event.
1,Not what I was expecting,"I bought this book for one of my bridesmaids, in whose wedding I was also a bridesmaid. She kept assuring us that we would be able to ""wear that dress again,"" so when it was my turn I thought this would be a funny gift for her at the rehearsal dinner. The book is not quite what I was expecting. I thought the pictures would illustrate the funny suggestions, but the pictures were just wierd. They were just pictures in the dress in different places, not what I had in mind, but it was too late to return it and order another."
4,An excellent film!,"It was an excellent film about a sheltered, inexperience white boy coming of age with the help of a street savvy young hoodlum. Recommended for all who want an enjoyable, funny, and relaxing film."
3,Big Shots review,Cool movie. Saw this movie back when I was a kid. Movies like this had a place. Wish they made more everyday movies today.
4,Nice item but a bit pricey,"Lots of space for the 15.4"" notebook and plenty of room for my other work related items. Lots of little compartments to place eyeglasses, pens and computer related acessories. The only thing I was a little disapointing was the price. I felt the amount paid was higher than I would have spent on a similar item by a reputable competitor."
4,Good All around backpack,"Great back pack. It really has the space needed to carry a laptop and some books. the only thing I'd like more is if the backpack was more business style black rather than the silver and black. That's just a taste issue. I also had an issue with the chest connector coming off and not staying in place. that's what stopped it from having a 5 star rating. I'd recommend this for anyone look for a laptop bag. Tons of pockets, great place to store pens and pencils, ipod, and many more compartments. When it expands, it is really big, almost too big."
3,Not for road warriors,"Good product for the occasional, short-trip traveler, as it is a sturdy, well-protected backpack with average-sized compartments. Not for the road warrior, though: the access to its compartments is unnaturally narrow, it doesn't hold enough stuff other than your laptop, your charger, your ipod, and some books, and it lacks placeholders for your bottle of water and cell phone. It could also use some protection underneath."
2,Not for everyday use,"I have used the bag quite extensively for about 1 year. During my last trip one side of the top handle became detached. Other than that, the bag still looks like it is brand new. I have lots of experience with laptop bags and travel a lot and never had a handle detachment before. This is very disappointing to me as I was convinced by someone that this was a quality bag and I spent about $30 more than I wanted to. Back to Targus bags for me.Other than the handle detachment, this bag was quite functional for me and I agree with most of the other comments about it. But don't buy one unless you can verify that something has been done to correct the handle problem."
3,ok we get the point,"This book is a quick and dissapointing read. Let me say I'm a Dylan and blues fan, and wouldn't have read it if I weren't. But McKeen is obsessed with Dylan, or ""His Holy Exalted Bobness"" as he calls him. Almost disturbingly obsessed. In fact, he can hardly write 5 pages without dropping his name or thinking ""how it felt for Bob to do (insert action here.)"" Yeah, I'm sure they're on a first name basis. His whole commentary and conversation is just annoying and feels forced. In short, the real Highway 61 and Dylan's ""Highway 61 Revisited"" are indescribably better. Buy the album and drive the highway....that is a lot more fun than reading irritating book."
5,great honest story of father and son travel on Highway 61,"This is a story about a divorced father who has spent a lot time away from his son. It is a road trip story, not a book focused on Dylan's Highway 61. Rather it is about traveling on that actual highway from the northern point in Minnesota to it's southern most point. The author weaves various music genres into the chapters, St Louis, Memphis, etc. If you are looking for a book on Dylan, don't be misled by the title. I found it to be a great read. McKeen and his son did something many people dream about doing with their kids."
2,Rating is based on non Lincoln grease gun,"I knew it wasn't for MY grease gun, but with some altering it will squeak by...for $6 and free shipping? It will hopefully work as good as the large hose clamp I previously used."
1,Really poorly made,"I was really looking forward to mounting my new grease gun on the wall. But after looking at the messed up piece that I recieved, there was no way this thing would work. The metal thumb flip/clasp on mine is malformed to say the least. It is just a piece of metal wrapped around the wire. There is no forming of it like you see in the pictures, so there is no way for it to push against the other wire to close. The wires are twisted out of whack and do not make a circular shape. More Chinese junk to go to the scrap yard. Don't waste your time with this thing."
2,"It does the job, but is cheap","I got a Lincoln grease gun holder a few years ago and was impressed with how well made it was. It always gives a positive ""snap"" when latching the grease gun in place. I use one hand to hold the grease gun, and the other to clamp the holder shut. When I got another grease gun, was glad to find the Lincoln holder on Amazon and ordered it. I am sorry to say that the quality of the newer grease gun holder falls far short of the older one. The wire arms tend to spread when applying pressure to close them. I have to use one hand to keep the wire arms from spreading too far apart while using the other hand to clamp it shut. This is not an easy task while using a few fingers to keep the grease gun in place until it is secure. I would not recommend this holder unless Lincoln brings the quality back up to what it was a couple years ago."
4,It is just OK product,The Grease Gun Holder holds the Grease Gun well but my grease gun has the grease tube inserted. I saw the grease dripping from the gun. This is not the fault of the grease gun holder but just the way it is. I don't think this holder is adding a lot of value for me but overall the product works the way it is designed.
4,finally something besides barbie.,"These are the cutest little dolls, ever. They are bendable and a little bit bigger then barbie, perfect for littler hands. My daughter picked one up and the hand came right off, and then she stuck it right back on...no breaking! The outfits are cute. We got the extra accessories and all four dolls. The hair is beutiful and easy to brush and doesn't fall out as your brushing it. The shoes can be tough to put on, sometimes. Yet I don't worry about finding them all over the house. My daughter(whose 6) liked Bratz for about 5 minutes, but these dolls she played with all night. Hopefully there will be more things available in the future, like furniture or more clothes."
3,Not really helpful,"The authors should have paid more attention how they present this issue. Maybe the book was written in very tight schedule. The book repeated itself many times and was really badly edited. The content itself was ok, however nothing really new and not enough good reasoning. All these same concepts are presented in the other literature of UCD and HCI. I suggest Eric Schaffer's book."
2,This book is not user friendly,"There's a lot words, but no substance. Whenit takes you 3 chapters to get to the point where you can begin to move from generalities to specifics, well, maybe the reader should have been consulted in the design of the outline."
3,Just okay,"Generally I love all of Grace Livingston Hill's books but this one I'd say was not a favorite. Maris was just a little too naieve to be realistic and though it has a good message, it just got a little long and maybe too hokey in some places. DO try other Grace Livinston Hill books though - you won't be disappointed!!!"
5,This step-by-step guide makes it easy for pet owners,"Hi,I wanted to write and say how much I've enjoyed reading 8 Weeks to a Healthy Dog by Shawn Messonnier, D.V.M. This step-by-step guide makes it easy for pet owners to give their dog the very best care around. Dr. Messonnier's book is comprehensive, it answered all of my questions and taught me a care routine that can't be matched. Now my dog is happy, healthy and as a pet owner I know I've finally got it right thanks to Dr. Shawn.Sincerely,Jennifer Gardner"
4,Has served me well except for one thing...,"I live about 300' off a county road. I was constantly being ""surprised"" by guests and deliveries. I bought the Dakota Alert WR 3000 with the Wireless Rubber Hose Alert kit to announce my visitors. I had tried motion sensor alerts and they provided numerous false notices because of the large wildlife population. I thought the rubber pressure hose would do better. I was extremely pleased with it for about a year. Our gravel drive proved too much for the rubber hose. It has cracked and split and only announces visitors once in a while when they hit it just right. So far I have not been able to locate a replacement for under $100.00. I feel there should have been a statement stating the rubber hose was meant for paved drives and not sturdy enough for a gravel drive."
2,driveway bell signal,Waste of money. Works about 50% of the time. Also bought another reciever. That doesn't work at all. Spent $200 for nothing.
4,"Good Product, just a few flaws","The Flip and Doodle Easel Desk was very easy to assemble but there were a few flaws in it. The Step 2 symbol on the red marker tray was upside down and the white dry erase board was scratched. But, my daughter loves playing with it."
5,Hours of fun,My 5yr old son just loves this whole setup and how it keeps all his art supplies together for him to use when he wants and not when I can get his things ready. But remember it's only as fun as the stuff you fill it with and it is on the smaller side but my very tall son uses it without any problem
4,Great combo desk/easel!,Just bought this desk and it is excellent. What more can you ask for. A desk and easel in one. Very functional. Wish the top flipped all the way down to cover the bins when not in use but no big deal. Stool is very sturdy. Easty to assemble - just a few screws. bins are a little small for the holes they go into. storage on back for coloring books. just a little on the small side. perfect for a 3-5 year old.
3,Couldn't assemble the work top,Not able to put on the work top on the desk. Looks very nice but couldn't assemble. Please let me know if you have any tips to put on the work top.
3,I disagree with the age range for this,"Don't get me wrong - it is adorable, sturdy, and even I didn't have much of a problem putting it together.The problem is that it really is for more of the 4+ age range. At the age of 2 my daughter was scared to sit on the stool because she would tip it over or slide off. And at least 3 small children have been smacked over the head by the 'flip table'.My biggest issue with the age range is the storage. It is great, there is a LOT of storage, and I can't wait to use it. But if you have little kids (again, under 4ish) there is no way you can leave stuff in this desk. Markers? Scissors? Pens? All 2 feet off the ground for little hands to get whenever? No way. =DJust something I thought people may want to keep in mind when looking at little desks!"
4,wonderful product,"Bought this for my 19-month old daughter, so she could learn to doodle on there instead of everywhere else...love the fact that the doodling board is also magnetic, so I can put those fridge magnetic alphabet letters on there to teach her as well.Love all those storage bins, they definitely help keep things organized.One small complaint...would like it better if the book shelf is on the sides instead of the back (why leave the sides empty?). I have it against a wall, so with the shelf on the back makes it useless...unless we move the entire thing out each time she needs a book...so her books end up in the larger bins at the bottom instead, which means one less storage item..."
5,great entertainment for toddler,"Bought for 2 year old grandson, he played on it for 2 hours first time. loves it, nice compartments for storage, very functional."
3,No surprise there,Got it fast.... It shipped in the original box. Mind you It was a Christmas present kinda hard to explain when it is staring right at them on the porch. Just would have been nice to wrap in brown bag or something so kids are surprised at Christmas.
4,Decent desk,"This desk is pretty good. There were some issues lining up some of the pieces. It is all made of sturdy plastic, but comes with a few screws. I couldn't line the easel up perfectly, but this did not effect the function at all. My son likes the desk okay. Mostly he prefers to carry the stool around the house and get into stuff he isn't supposed to be into. The stool isn't made for standing on, but when used for its purpose, it is great.Also, I like this because it is very easy to clean. He colored it with washable markers and I was able to clean the whole desk up with wet wipes."
5,excellent introduction to Watts,"this is my favorite book by Alan Watts. originally published in 1947 while he was still an Anglican priest, it is perhaps a better introduction to his work for newcomers -- not only because the book is written in a readable and accessible style, but also for his clear discussion of basic tenets and flaws in the Western/Protestant framework of theology and religion.from there, he shows how the mystical aspects of Christianity -- in a similar way to traditions such as Zen Buddhism -- can help break beyond Western culture's materialist representation of religion.i found this book useful because of the straightforward writing style, and because it depicts Watts' own thoughts on mysticism, religion, and God at a foundational level, using practical examples from various rites and liturgies. Watts shows us how to be alive, spiritually."
3,Tough read,"I love listening to Watts, but have never had an easy time with his books. (I've read three that I can remember.) Behold the Spirit was difficult for me. I skimmed/skipped over large hunks of the book, so it may not be fair for me to even review it. For sure, there are flashes of TOTAL brilliance. Stunning. But then he dives deeply into subject matter that, frankly, I had no interest in. It may end up being one of those books I put on the shelf, intending to read again someday, that I never get back to."
1,Oh the lies I hear.,"First of all, most of Avril's music is not written by her. Have you read all the credits on her CD? Maybe you should. Second she does NOT play her own music. She only knows a few cords on her guitar. That's the only reason the band is there.She's nowhere near 'Punk'. She used to be a country singer up in little Napanee. Her producers dressed her up like this to be the new 'trend'.Her music is horrible. I'll give her points for singing. She can do that, barely. Every song on this sounds the same. Why? Because they're pop songs. I'd advise you to save your money and buy something decent like AFI, Alkaline Trio, or Rancid."
2,Save your pennies,"Making music doesn't have to be so complicated I guess. Avril gets by it seems on high pitched yelling and public image alone. However, when you strip away the tough girl attitude, all you are left with is lukewarm sludge.The only redeeming track on this album is ""I'm with you"" in which Avril actually makes a half hearted attempt at actually singing. Certianly not worth the purchase of the entire album."
5,Exceptionally and Surprisingly Extravagant,"Avril Lavigne is obviously better than just ""Complicated."" Her entire album is filled with hits, none that seem like they don't come from anywhere but the heart. She is not to be comparied to Alanis or anyone of that nature for she is in a league way on her own. ""Losing Grip"", ""Unwanted"", ""Nobody's Fool"" are just a few of the excellent songs on her album. If you don't have it, you should!!!"
5,Avril Rocks!!,"Avril may be young, but she sure knows how to rock!! With the release of her first album ""Let Go"", her vocals are amazing! She really does ""Let Go"" With her voice! Anyone who is looking for music with upbeat, and easy to sing-along to, should buy Avril's Cd. You're in for a real treat!!! =)"
5,Go buy this cd,if you have not already go and get this cd right away it is one of the best cd's I own there is not one good reason why not to buy this cd. Every song is good most of the cd's I own have some songs that i skip over but there are no songs on this cd that i would consider skiping over.
3,Get over it.,"So she dresses ""punk"" and doesn't care about things. Big deal. Dressing a certain way doesn't guarantee your album is punk.What the album is, though, is kinda catchy. I love the first 6 or 7 songs, with the exception of skater boi (can that track PLEASE be thrown in the trash?) I haven't listened to the end of the album as much, but it's not as interesting as the first half in my opinion. There's nothing punk about this CD. If you want punk, listen to Rancid or Social D, because you won't find it here. Not even pop punk. I call her a more guitarish, easy to swallow, young Alanis. (Not because she's from Canada, but because she reminds me of it in her singing.)"
5,Simply Excellent,This CD is WONDERFUL!!! There is not a song on it that you can skip. Words can't explain it.!
4,KIND OF GOOD,"MY FAVORITE SONG HAS TO BE ""IM WITH YOU"" ""COMPLICATED"" IS OKAY BUT SOME OF HER SONGS ARE REALLY CHILDISH ""SK8ITER BOI""IS KIND OF GOOD BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S KIND OF STUPID I HAVE THE CD AND I LIKE IT NOT MY FAVORITE BUT IT'S OKAY"
5,Avril's great,"All of the songs on her cd are so powerful and have a strong meaning that just hits you in the head when you listen to it. I love the way she expresses herself in all of her songs so easily. She's a great singer, a great writer, a great guitar player and has one of the greatest cds I've heard in a long time."
5,THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFRENT,"Avril is sure something diffrent. Never have I heard such a voice. I think this album is going to hit the billboards. I really enjoyed her album ""Let Go"", its so outthere. ""Complicated is one of my favorite songs. I like the way she brings out her self, her true self in her music. Avril is not being fake she tells it how it is. And I like that in an artist. There is hardly any artist that come straight forward and tell it how it really is. Hope her album is as good or better than this one. I really got hooked on her music, her lyrics especially. Avril is a good writter. I wish her and the band the best of success."
4,It rocks,"I bought this Cd a while ago and listened to it over and over and got kind of sick of it, but it is a good CD and worth the price!"
1,nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"he wasnt a guy!she wasnt a girl!they were both hermaphrodites, this album is total rubbish"
5,AVRIL ROX,"I just wanted to tell every1 out there that this is the best CD that i have EVER bought! some people dont like her....thats your problem! Her songs sre soo easy to understand, she is a brilliant song writter. I think most of her fans will be about her age though (like me) coz he music isnt for older people its mostly about tennagers lifes....her life...i think! Well if u havent bought the CD yet the get down to your local Cd store and buy it before its sold out!!!....sk8er boi is the BEST!!!"
5,Connections with Avril,"This album is breath taking! I relate with her thoughts and emotions to the thoughts in so many ways, I didn't think it was possible. Her voice opens my ears and my soul to a whole new kind of genre of music. Her songs are meaningful and they show me what kind of person I am connecting with through song. Avril fan all the way for me!!! This girl is talented and not to mention extrememly bright when it comes to the road of life. She knows what she wants and shes out to get it! Ladies & Gents... now introducing... AVRIL LAVIGNE!!!"
4,Avril ROCKS!!!,"I love Avril Lavigne. She is one of few popular singers of today who actually sings, writes her own songs, and has a band that plays the music instead of using pre-taped, synthesized [music]. People say she poses as punk, but really isn't. If you listen to her lyrics you realize that she isn't trying to be ""punk"". She just wants to be herself. Her lyrics actually have a meaning and a good beat. She's definetely a good role model for anyone with big dreams. I love her and her music. She has talent! The one thing I don't like is the song ""I'm With You"". It has a great melody, but the story told by the lyrics is pathetic. It just isn't a good song. Other than that Avril ROCKS!!!"
2,LET GO OF THIS CD!,"so heres unother teen singer who claims to be different from the others but too bad, her difference aint to convincing...so wat if shes a tom boy, her music does sound girly still......sketer boi's okay...but i feel she still has a long way to go.....for now...this cd isn't worth buying...so letgo of it!"
1,Terrible,"Ahh, how I love the ignorance of these pop lovers. (note: Avril is not punk, but pop). I especially like the spotlight review where it says she writes her own music and plays her instrument. HELLO! She has a team of writers that helped her (just look in the liner notes) and she can't play guitar for crap. Also in the liner notes, there are no less than five(?) people given credit for guitar work. Why do you think she plays with a full band and doesn't play guitar herself?? Proof: in the video for complicated she is pictured playing a single chord; G. That chord isn't even in the song!This C.D.=crap. don't buy it."
2,Let go,The cd itself was fine and the order was correct but the cd cases were all broken. This was really disappointing and I wish I would have been able to send them back for good condition cases
2,"I know many people will not find my review helpful, but...","I'm not a person that hates trendy music. I'm not against Hot Topic. I think people should be able to listen to the music that people want to listen to, shop wherever the want to, etc.Behind the 'punk rock image' Avril plays music that you've heard before. She deals with the same lyrical topics as many pop icons that you hear on MTV. Avril isn't really groundbreaking. Sorry to break the hearts of some.However, I will give Avril credit for writing her own material at a young age. She mixes her influences up, but as I said earlier, it's been done before, and it's been done better."
1,very very annoying,avril has the worst voice ive ever heard it sounds like britney spears with hiccups and her songs like sk8er boy are just too queer for anybody cool to dig maybe chiks like this but if youre a dude stay far away from this pile of crap avril is cute and id do her but that doesnt mean she has talent as a musician if this is talent i guess the song balls to the wall is a deep and complex recording
1,"Like, um","Like, Avril is, like, totally, like the bestest! She, like, writes her, like, own songs and can, like, play one note on a guitar thingy. She's, like, totally, like kewl and sooo punk and, like, she like does like her own thing. Avril rox!"
1,APRIL LAVINE,"Companies got bored...found a weird looking girl who was willing to dress funny, jump around and act like a boy, hooked up computers to her microphone and made millions off her. YAY. phony phony phony...In the words of Cold----..""STUPID GIRL""..."
1,Avril Lavigne....a truth unseen,"Ahem, well the only reason I see that someone would praise this album...is if they're getting some major kickback from it. Otherwise, I know that many of the folks who previously reviewed this album would have loved to hit a 1 rather than a 4 or 5. But alas, in keeping with tradition of the mass, they believe that they are obliged to follow the pack and, consequently, think alike as well...or else.I am not particularly fond of this cliched album or the cliched Avril because listening to her dull and ORDINARY music (or cacophony, if you like) is sincerely a waste of one's precious ear drums -- sorry Avril, I know that this is way out of your domain, being ordinary and what not, but truth's a filthy she-dog, ain't it"
2,Why do I like this THING?!,"I listen to THIS all the time. But I can't figure out why. Shes not punkish at all, just ""herself"" could be manufactured though. Her music though interesting is pop anyone that puts this in the same catagory as the Ramones (punk) is sick. I don't even really listen to the songs, though Nobodys Fool is funny because shes doing this ""rap"" thing and fails badly. I am (suprisingly) a fan, but still can't figure out why.Can't fully endorse this because its not great. Make sure you know you REALLY REALLY want this thing before you buy it.Why stars, its ok (3 stars but loses one because I can't figure out why I like her or this CD."
1,This sucks,"This album sucks!! How can anyone like this crap? Avril sucks at singing and can't even play a guitar!!!! For good music listen to Lacuna Coil, Hatebreed, Dimmu Borgir, From Autumn To Ashes, Suffocation, Crimson Thorn, Vomitorial Corpulence, etc. I don't really need to say anything else."
1,I fail to see this as music......,Anyone who likes this or gives this good ratings must be tone or talent deaf.....
3,Let Go,"Let's say it: Miss Lavigne isn't really the kind of person I would admire in my life. Her atittude annoys me that's unbeliavable. However, I respect her as an artist. She has probably work her ass off to do her first album and her voice isn't really that bad, is it?'Let Go' isn't the best album in the world but judging on her, as i have already pointed before, voice, song writing(even though,yeah some verses ar trully imbarrassing and childish asswel)is a decent CD. And I repeat: I do not find her very good as a person but about the music that's it.I suggesst to all the Avril 'haters' to don't flame so much about her.As you have said:'She's not punk she's just a poser'.Well, why the hell bother then? She'll certainly not disappear because some1 hate her. There will be always ppl who like her, remember that."
3,Gyöngyi Csatári,"The first song ""Losing grip"" is great! The songs that were played on the radio (""complicated"", ""im with you"") are just ok, and the rest of the album is weak. Maybe the next album will be better..."
4,"Good, but not punk","Avril has some classic songs, but is nowhere near ""punk"".Avril's music is definetely pop. She has some classics on this album but is NOT punk! Hope this is helpful. (Ok it probably isn't)"
5,TIGHTEST,"I LOVE AVRIL. SHE IS THE BEST AND I HOPE SHE GETS #1 ON THE BILLBOARD CHARTS.SHE WAS AT THE NICK STUDIOS AND PREFORMED SK8ER BOI AND COMPLICATED.THAT IS WHY I GAVE HER 5 STARS.SHE THE BEST AND , WHOEVER GIVES HER 1 OR 2 STARS IS VERY VERY MEAN BECAUSE SHE IS A GREAT SINGER, AND SHE DESERVES 5 OR 4 STARS. AND WHOEVER GAVE HER 3 STARS IS I GUESS O.K.BYE BYE."
3,awkward to go,"Avril may claim herself a punk at heart but her music is far from that. The punkiest song here, Sk8er Boi, is still miles away from a punk song.Don't be mistaken. The album is a rather listenable pop album with songs like Naked. The girl sings and writes, but her age really reveals the sometimes awkward lyrics despite the soaring vocals and good melodies. Inevitably, she draws comparison with another angst-ridden mistress Alanis Morissette and even labelmate Pink.The road is long, and Avril may need a little more time to prove her place in the music world. However, too much of intervention on the record company's part results in another manufactured pop artist."
3,"she's talented, but...","I think Avril is an excellent singer with major-league vocal ability, and most of the songs are catchy and decent. The problem is that although Avril's image is ""punk,"" her music is far from it. Only ""Sk8r Boi"" even remotely resembles this genre (and VERY remotely). Make no mistake, this is pop music. some impressive vocals though."
5,Awesome CD!,"I'd heard about Avril when she first came out, and was very excited about getting her cd. And I have to say, it has become my favorite cd. She's has beautiful lyrics and great songs.My favorite songs on the album are Complicated, Skaer Boi, and Nobody's Fool. But, I love all the songs on the album. I love the lyrics in I'm With You. I also like the lyrics in Sk8er Boi, because they are cute, and it's my favorite song on the album.Overall, this is an awesome cd! I love it. I even like it more than my Pink and No Doubt CD's."
1,AVRIL SUCKS.,"You have the choice of listening to anybody you want. Why waste your time on Avril Lavigne? She is the biggest poser ALIVE. Buy this cd, and it's money down the drain. She has the most annoying voice in the whole world, and absolutley CANNOT sing live. Throw this CD away."
3,"Good, but not great.","A few good songs, but she needs some polishing as a song-writer. I can't wait to hear her next stuff."
5,Avril Lavinge Fan 4 Ever,I really love this cd and Avril Lavigne! She's soo cool! This is one of those cds you just gotta have!
4,Has awesome potential,"This is a very good CD. I did not give it 4 stars, because the lyrics COULD be much better, Avril seems like a very intelligant girl, and if she worked a bit harder it could be MUCH better. Still, it is great. My favorite track is Losing Grip, a powerful song that, in my opinion, shows Avril at her best. She's a sk8er chick too, how cool is that? =P"
2,All together on the count of 3: 1.... 2....3.....,"THIS IS NOT PUNK MUSIC! That being said, I don't mind her music. I actually liked ""Complicated"" the first 500,000 times I heard it. Let's face it though, the music industry is totally fabricating her ""punk"" image in order make her more appealing to the pop music population. Teeny-boppers all over are pleading, ""But she's punk!"". Is she? What is punk about her music? The fact that she sings about a ""Sk8er Boi""? It's absolutely ridiculous. Can she play that guitar? I'd love to go and see her live to confirm that. Her music isn't the worst (although some of her songs really are pathetic), but any artist who is destined to disappear 1 year after their debut album (and we all know she will) hardly deserves 5 stars."
1,get real!!!!,"ok people listen to me! this girl named Abril Labingue THinks she is so cool and she isnt! she looks like a boy, sings like a boy, and she even was in boyscouts when she was 6!!!! She also smells like John Mayers socks!!!!ok dont be fooled by this sk8ter boi! she is sooo complicated and she stinkz on ice so get a life Abril Labingue!"
2,What is wrong with you people?????,"Avril Lavigne has a great voice. It was that combined with the radio version of Complicated that got me to buy this album, and God do I wish I had bought the single. Her friends on the instruments are basically terrible. The songs themselves make it well known that Avril idealizes Alanis (and I actually like Alanis quite a bit) since she constantly tries to sing in Alanis's style. The band and the style are a big mistake, hunny. Get some good musicians and sing your own way cause your voice is awesome. as far as the lyrics go, are you all fourteen? I can't believe how so many of you who reviewed this album said you could identify with her songs. I'll admit I like Complicated, but even with that song, only the radio remix (which improves on the instrumental ten fold) is worth listening to. When she looses the band and grows up a little she'll be awesome, but this album sucks. If you want to hear Complicated buy the single cause this album will only disappoint."
1,NOT PUNK,"you people are fools. you can like avril and be a big fan, that doesnt bother me. SHE IS NOT PUNK THOUGH!! she is so not punk. real punk bands are not on mtv, they are on cds that are 3 dollars with 20+ songs. avril and kelly osbourne and all them are not punk. sorry, but they arent."
1,Complicatingly Unwanted In My World,1. Losing Grip 1/52. Complicated 1/53. Sk8er Boi 1/54. I'm With You 1/55. Mobile 1/56. Unwanted 1/57. Tomorrow 5/58. Anything But Ordinary 1/59. Things I'll Never Say 1/510. My World 1/511. Nobody's Fool 1/512. Too Much To Ask 1/513. Naked 1/514. Why? 2/5
2,The Bonus Track is on the US/Canada version as well,"The ""Japanese Bonus Track"" ""Why"" is on the North American CD as well, in the enhanced CD part (so only accessible from a computer with a CD-ROM drive). There are two versions of this song though (one for tender American ears with the swearing cut out (that's the one on the NA CD and on the American Wedding Soundtrack Album) and one for the rest of the world (that was actually played during American Wedding). Not sure which version is on the Japanese Album though."
3,An average attempt from Avril,"At first glance, Let Go seems to make the grade. The melodies on practically all of the tracks are extremely catchy, albeit the lyrics aren't the greatest. But all in all, I did enjoy the album. However, it's not something you want to listen to again and again. Although I still like a few tracks (I'm With You, Things I'll Never Say, and Naked) there's nothing about the album that makes me want to choose it over other pop or rock albums. Finally, if you are looking for a pretty decent pop/rock album, don't let the negative hype about Avril steer you in another direction. But don't expect anything truely phenomenal or unique either."
3,Is She Losig Grip? 'Cuase I'm Not With Her!?,"Avril Lavigne is a really talented singer/songwtiter. I do have her album and I excpected way more from Avril. Her first single ""Complicated"" caught my attention aswell as ""Sk8er Boi"" ""I'm With You"" and ""Losing Grip"". My favorite track on the album is ""I'm With You"" but the rest really are depressing, annoying, or just garbage. Avril is 17 movin' on to 18. But I really think you should either download her music or don't buy it at all. Avril should wait maybe 6 more years to be in the music biz. This isn't worth listening to nore buying..."
1,I can't even believe this thing exists,"I'm not even sure what to say, Growing up in the punk era and being around punks and skaters almost all of my life I look at her and I just can't believe that she would claim such things, I would love to see her actually try to hang with punks and skaters then watch them beat her ***, She couldn't survive in the punk culture if she had security around her 24/7.I'm just more shocked that she makes these statements and doesn't expect any comments on them from the people who have to look at her with disgust.Avril, I think that you were better off Bible thumpin with your country music, You need to go back to your hole and leave real punk music to real punks."
3,Who Cares For Labels,"Is this punk ,as some say it trashes? No way, it is just good pop music. Is it lyrically or musically mind altering? Most likely not. I know I like the singalong jauntiness of some of it.The measure of this album will be in years to come and whether those who listen to it today will continue to do so in their future years.The measure of the artist will be if she can produce something better and more mature the next time out, and then the rest of us can judge this work against anything else Avril releases. As is, this album is not a classic, but it is good pop music, better than a lot of stuff on the charts at the moment anyway.Like it or not for what it is, not what the image of the artist is supposed to be."
5,This is an awesome CD!!,"Not only does this CD have great lyrics, awesome guitar work, and a great message but it is also inspirational. Avril sings about being yourself and how you shouldn't let what other people think, say, and how they act effect who you are. I think everyone can learn great things from Avril and her songs. Everyone should get a copy of this CD for their collection. It doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to, because this CD is just too good to pass up."
4,happily confused,"i don't know what's wrong with me. i can't remember ever liking a pop song, and definitely not anything by anyone fairly young, but i like this entire album. hmm.i also, on the rare occasion i like a top40, can't remember ever feeling like hearing a pop song, and yet i find myself jammin away to this album at the computer. hmm.so i am confused. i usually listed to angry girl music of the pjharvey variety or punk rock or dave matthews (mmm, yummy) and this album is nothing like these. it very much fits into the pink, britney category. i like a couple of these types of songs, but never a whole album ... i can't figure it out. i just like avril.so... i'm telling you this album is worth getting if you're thinking about it. if i can like it, most people can.first listen fav's: unwanted,anything but ordinary, naked, nobody's fool - in that order"
5,"Avril's ""Let Go"" is awesome!!","Avril is extremely talented and her debut, ""Let Go"" is outstanding. If you like punk rock, or just rock, then absolutely get this cd! Avril wrote all of these songs herself and she is just fabulous. She is definitely worth listening to and will be around long, long after Britney Spears will. Avril keeps it real, does not show off and is really cute. ""Let Go"" has excellent songs like ""Complicated"" and ""Sk8er Boi"". If you know good music, get ""Let Go""!"
2,"overhyped, formulaic tripe","she gets a bonus star for some pretty nice extra multimedia content included on the CD. but the music is remarkably ordinary and bland - if you've heard Complicated and Sk8er, you've heard everything on the album. every song is slow start, then a fast, pseudo-exciting tempo switch coupled with some screaming by avril, then devolves into a repetitive, bland chorus."
4,Pretty good.,"This is a pretty good CD. Some of the songs are good (they're mostly just radio hits), and the rest is filler. But the songs have good lyrics, and she does play a mean guitar. Overall, Avril does a good job for a debut album, and she is one of my favorite female artists."
5,This CD is the best!,I think this CD is really great! Avril rocks and u should think that to. Avril's music is very unique and ha very different style. For a 17 year old she sings about very serious stuff. I think everyone should buy this cd because it's great and it is the best!!
3,"avril lavigne, just a masquerade.","Is that music really hers? She didn't write all those songs by herself. SO please, don't call her an awesome writer. She co-wrote them. You say she's something new, I say she's just another clone of Britney Spears. Just disgruntled and a new wardrobe.There's nothing really ""new"" in her music. I mean she barely plays it and she has elements of sum 41 in there. With the whole rap thing. I personally think that Avril is a poseur. Her image might scream ""IM PUNK"" but her music screams out ""IM POP"". It's just the image that makes you think that music is what it is."
5,One of the Best cd's on the earth!(and probably in space to),"Okay, i absolutley LOVE avril lavigne!! she has a good sound and things and then the lyrics are AMAZING!! she has such an incredible way to express her feelings an junk and its just incredible! my favorite songs on the album are uhhh ALL OF THEM!! I LOVE THEM ALL!! but i especially love losing grip, sk8er boi, complicatied, things i'll never say and unwanted. but yeah.. THis song is THE BEST!! I definetly reccomend that you buy it!!"
5,WOW!,"All I can say about this album is WOW!. I wasn't sure about buying the album but I got bored of complicated after awhile and wanted to hear more of Avril's music, So I bought her album. I would reccomend it to anyone, it's fantastic! Go Avril!"
2,Problems with the hype of Avril,"Okay, honestly this album is not as bad as I thought it would be. However, the entire ""punk"" persona Avril claims to devote her music to is far from center. I'm not a fan of hardcore punk music but I have heard it and 'Let Go' is not that. Obviously this is female pop-rock, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it in general, but when you want the public to percieve you as an alternative, rebellious, non comformist who despises top pop acts of the day..and then put out an album which has mainstream pop written all over it..you're just beggin to be criticized. Fellow female artists you could compare such as Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton, and Alanis Morisette do not present a false image musically or literally. Avril Lavinge will most likely become a success due to the part of mass media hype and industry appraisal...there's no denying it."
3,Avril: They either love her or hate her. No middle road.,"I picked up this album because I like the girl's voice. After having listened to the album several times, I have decided that Let Go is kind of hit or miss, overall.The two already released singles (Complicated, Sk8r boi) are okay, and are representative of about half the album. People who like those two singles will find 3 or 4 more songs that will appeal to them on the same level.It's the darker, angstier songs on the album that appeal to me. Whether the girl has any experience in life or not, she sings her songs well, and has an appealing voice.On the down side, there are some songs on the album that aren't good. The chief offender is the pseudo-rap whine fest Nobody's Fool.Overall, I find that I like enough of the album that I can just skip over the few songs I didn't like."
5,Avril Lavigne- Let Go,"This album is so kool,I've bought 5 of dis album I keep playing dem & dey break , so yeah.Who da hell am I writing 2?.I just have 2 say dat I love Avril Lavigne!All I do in klass is bludge, searching 4 Avril Lavigne pics & nue sights.Any wayz byze..."
4,One of the Best,"This is like one of the best CD I bought!! Its awesome! It isn't really, really good, but it made me listen to it at least two songs a day, I got addicted to it. You will only like this Cd if you like Avril Lavigne, and she friggin rocks!!!"
5,Great Cd!!,"Hey Guys~I bought ""Let Go"" by Avril Lavigne the first day it came out and i luv it!! It rocks!! I listen to it 24-7 and can never get enough of it.. the best part is, you know how on almost every cd theres at least one song you skip over.. well not on ""Let Go"" EVERY song is great!! You will also relate to a lot of them!! I recomend this CD to ANYONE, so go out there and buy it NOW!! =)"
5,"Buy This CD and Don't ""Let Go""","Never in my life have I ever come across a female singer to make it in the rock world at such a young age- 17 years old. This is a very refreshing cd, especially after an overload of pop music in the music industry over the last couple of years. Don't get me wrong...pop is good music. But too much pop (especially young teenage girl sugar sweet pop) gets annoying. Avril Lavigne, in my opinion, is a very promising singer, and she definitely has what it takes to make it in the music industry. I bought this cd recently, and it is by far one of my favorite cd's in my whole collection. With some loud songs, some fast toe-tappers, and even a few slow, inspirational songs, this cd is a must-buy. If you haven't bought this cd yet, let alone listen to any of her songs, I urge you to buy this cd; you won't be sorry."
1,Punk nah not really...,"They have been calling this Punk but no way jose, this is nowhere near it, it's not grunge it's not even rock. Avril is just a new teen girl making teen pop and to selling her music it was easier to pretend beeing a punk then the ordinary teen-pop britney look a like.The cd is bad, i mean it's rehehellly bad. ""Complicated"" is a decent pop song, i think it was quite catchy, but spare me from the rest. ""Skater Boy"" for example is a real pain, and it proves how much punk music she's into. Liked ""Comlicated"" then get the single,..."
3,Just another flavor of pop...,"If you're into pop music with supposedly ""thoughtful"" lyrics, then this is the album for you. But for the rest, let me just say that, at the end, it's no different from other pop artists.I bought this album because someone told me she's simmilar to Alanis Morissette, but turns out that the only things simmilar among the 2 are the fact that they both play the guitar and come from Canada. Bottom line: Lavigne is just another creation by the pop industry. You have been warned."
3,not what it seems to be.....,"Ok...when I first saw avril I thought "" cool something different for this industry run by people like britney spears,shakira,etc.""One would think that by judging avrils punk image that her music would be punk as well. But after I sampled this in a music store I found this album to be strictly pop and nothing else. Even though songs like ""sk8er boi"" add a slight rock edge, everything else sounds like all other pop songs that get so much radio play, today. Dont get me wrong I respect avril for being different and I like her style. But Im skeptical as to whether her image is punk, because thats what sells...or if its cause she really is. All I know is that her image does not match with her music.Basically, this is a good album, but if you're expecting loud guitar riffs and an overall punk sound then don't waste your time."
3,Avril is worth the cd price,"In today's music avril is out of the ordinary because unlike some people that have to have produced pop garbage, rely on their sexy looks or the lack of knowing what race they are avrilknows who she is and has a good strong voice. Her music speaksto teenagers the way an album should. Sex sells is obviously what keeps half these overrated and rather talentless artists in the music industry today. Avril is attractive but doesn't have to lower herself to a sexy image to sell records cause sheis actually talented. I liked this album alot and do suggest that you buy it if you like what you have heard from her so far."
2,"POSER, BUT TALENTED","toooooo bad that avril is a lil wanna be rocker. if she wasn't this cd would have been better, and maybe i would give her credit. i believe that yes, she can write, and yea she can sing ...and she plays that guitar. i heard on VH1 that she can't even skateboard. every rocker knows how to skateboard. hello POSER 101!! honestly there are only a few good songs ont he cd. they are:1) losing grip2) i'm with you3) unwanted4) things i'd never saythats all. like seriously i got tired of this cd after i heard it for the first time. avril sorry but NOOOO!"
3,Curious guilty pleasure,"I bought this CD on the strength of ""Complicated"" which is one of those perfect pop summer songs. I must admit that the song is already starting to wear on me a bit. So I was quite surprised to find out that the rest of the CD is really good. Is this a 'punk' CD? Relative to Britney/Pink/Boy Bands and almost everything TRL-related this has a uniqueness and certain independent charm that is in a way 'punk'. Sad to say but that is about as punk as things get these days in pop music. Overall: Very catchy tunes but short shelf-life as the songs are pretty straightforward arrangements."
4,"It's great, but not a classic","I got this CD on a fluke. I like to go out on a limb to find new music and was impressed by what this teenager had to say. It is great rock music with meaning you'll never get from Britney or Christina. However, there is plenty of room for improvement, and provide she isn't a one hit wonder, I am sure we will see it.The only thing I find a bit disturbing is the lyrics. While I appreciate the depth of them, the subject matter seems a bit much to be coming from someone still in high school..."
5,Finally! Some originality!!,"I instantly became a HUGE Avril fan when i heard 'complicated.' She doesn't take no for an answer, she cool and she marches to the beat of her own drum. Her music is cool and most importantly real. I wouldn't let younger kids listen to it, though, some of the lyrics aren't appropriate. Avril is amazing, I highly recommend this one!"
4,Recommended,"I first got this CD a short while after it had been released and soon found that many of the songs were easy to listen to. I found I could listen to the same songs over and over and still not get tired of them, and for this reason Avril Lavigne is my favorite artist.Contrary to some CD's where many of the songs are just there to fill up space, I've found that every song has thought and emotion put into it, and although the simplicity of the lyrics at times can make you wince, you will soon forget about it as the song will quickly carry you past it.It is true, though, that the songs are very simple and for that I give it 4 stars. What I love most and I'm sure that many who listen to her will too is the deep, richness of her voice.I'll never tire of it."
5,This is an awesome CD that totally ROCKS!,"Today, September 10, 2002, means that it has been a week since I first heard the Avril Lavigne song Sk8er Boi! That is one of the greatest songs ever!!!!! This CD is great to get just for that one song! But anyway.......I liked the song Complicated, but I wasn't going to buy the CD. I was just going to wait until it came out on a CD of Various Artists, and get it then. Then, ONE WEEK AGO, I heard the song Sk8er Boi on the radio and found out it was also by Avril Lavigne! I'm listining to that song right now! Anyway, once I knew both those songs were by her, I really wanted this CD and got it quickly after. This entire CD rocks! The songs are so awesome! And I don't know how I could have lived without the song Sk8er Boi! That song will NEVER get old! Anyway, this CD rocks! I totally, completely, highly reccomend it to anyone!"
5,This is the best CD I have honestly ever loved!!,"Avril Lavigne's song ""Complicated"" is the best song I have ever heard in my life. There was something about it that has made me become a huge Avril fan and I will be the rest of my life. I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO BUY THIS CD!!"
3,An Okay Cd Impressive For A First,"I was anticipating Avril Lavigne's debut Cd release because I really liked her song Complicated, featured on MTV's TRL. Getting a biography on her from her website is a big foreshadow to what kind of music would appear on her Cd. She's quite a singer, and a great song writer, but the music her words go to are pretty annoying. When the annoying ""rock"" I love rock/punk, just this one didn't seem to work that well are taken out to leave a few guitars, and her voice the Cd is amazing. I however would reccomend buying this Cd if only for Complicated, which is a great song! I hope Avrils first Cd will be a success (I bought it today, the first day it's out) so we can hear more from her in the future.. Oh yeah, if you like Britney Spears, you probably won't like Avril Lavigne. She's a complete 180 compared to Spears, thank God.."
1,avril is old evanescence is new and better!,"avril is old evanescence is new and better! i dont really like avril alot anymore, i mean some but not alot. i heard from one of my friends that she found where avril said something bad about the ramones and avril said she dont like her fans!! that's what made me not be a fan of her anymore!!!! avril is not really wanting to be a singer, she's just a poser most people call her that and it's true! well my advice dont buy her albums. thankyou for reading my review."
5,Wow..Awesome CD..Avril Lavigne has an Unbelievable voice..,"well well...this CD is great..at first, i thought this cd was going to suck because of the vibes that i got from her...but i was very wrong. Avril Lavigne has an awesome voice. All the songs on the cd are catchy and pretty. I also give her band two thumbs up...they sound great together..i RECOMMEND this CD for sure..buy it now! take care everyone."
3,Punk?,"Avril is a cool artist but punk? I hightly doubt this. She has to constantly remind everyone she's a punk skater girl.Her music is cool though, more like pop with the guitars, but cool anyway. So check her out if that's what you like."
3,Pop rock drama queen,"It was ok. What more did anyone expect? Catchy pop tunes.Just wanted more to respond to some of the other reviews.One review quoted the 'bad' lyrics. Whilst not ground breaking they aren't as bad as made out by the quote because it was taken out of context. Anything can be made to look worst than it is taken out of context. In full, the lyrics don't seem that bad:I like you the way you are when we're drivin in your car and you're talkin to me one-on-one. But you become somebody else round everyone else. Watchin your back, like you can't relax. You're tryin to be cool. You look like a fool to me.Maybe the reviewer didn't understand the 'complicated' lyrics.She should die?C'mon get a life, there are far more important things in this world than hating a girl who sings pop music for a living. There are plenty of people who deserve to die for things they have done, making teen angst pop rock isn't one of them."
1,CAN SOMEONE SHUT THIS B**** UP,"I HATE EVER SONG THIS SL*T SONGS. THAT ""COMPLICATED"" DRIVES ME CRAZY ALL THE TIME. IT MAKES WANNA DISTROY THE F***IN RAIDO. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SHE OT A RECORD DEAL. SH""T I NEVER SANG IN MY LFIFE AND AFTER HEARING 3 OF HER SONGS I CAN GO MAKE AND ALBUM AND SEL MILLIONS OF RECORDS."
3,"not bad, but not great","This cd isn't that bad, and I don't mind listening to it, but come on, this is not punk. ""Let Go"" is and okay cd, but Avril parades around saying that she is a skater punk and that her music is punk. It is not. If she didn't go around saying it was, I would probably like it more.In its own element, this cd isn't really all that bad. The songs are fun to listen to. The lyrics are a little corny sometimes, but they're not bad. By corny, I mean that a lot of the songs are saying ""I'm different! I'm no teeny bopper!"". She REALLY runs it into the ground sometimes.So basically what I'm saying is that if you buy this cd hoping for some punk extravaganza, you will be very dissapointed, but if you buy this cd for something fun to listen to, you won't.If you want punk, listen to something that is actually punk, like the Clash."
5,the new punk queen....,"ok.....i have just listened the let go album.......and i think it's pretty good for her first try!!!.....i can hear some cool influences like alanis morrissete.....i would prefered that avril use a more Punk sound.....because let go its kinda Pop-Rock with some sparks of Punk....you know...you see this cute girl with her punk attitude singing songs like I'm With you...it's kinda strange....(by the way, great song!!)in general i think Let Go is a great cd from an excelent upcoming star...."
1,Avril sucks,All I have to say is that Avril sucks. She'a a terrible singer and this cd is crap. Her only good songs are: Sk8ter Boi and I'm with you. The rest are crap. She's the worst singer in the music business and she should also take speech therapies. I don't recommend this album to anyone.
3,"Not great, Not terrible, Just mediocre.","Despite the hardcore pretenses of Avril Lavigne, this album is so industry. Although she got co-writing credits, most of the songs sound like they were crafted by a team of ""9-to-5"" writers in Nashville. That's a good thing if you don't like anything that deviates from the contemporary hit formula. That's a bad thing if you're looking for a memorable cd with true artistic integrity."
3,Grrl power redux,"The ""anti-Britney""? Sure, whatever you say. Honestly, this is just a throwback to those halcyon days of oh, say 1997, when every week it seemed there was yet another angry young woman yelling at her mom through the tv screen, each one as real as could be, & each one sounding exactly like the one we'd just heard...to be fair, though, I have to admit that some of the songs on this lp are pretty damned catchy, and while there is nothing here to justify the carpet-bombing of self-important hype that preceded this release, still, catchy is nothing to sniff at in these drab, tuneless days (then again, maybe you LIKE Papa Roach). Frankly, if you're looking for Important Insights into Today's Teenage Girl, I'd suggest you stick with Pink (the real anti-Britney), but if you've ever wondered what Leslie Gore might sound like if she were making records now, then I couldn't think of a better guide than ""Let Go""."
5,It rocks!,"Avril Lavigne's CD is excellent. It has pop, rock, punk, and love all in one CD by 1 artist. ""Complicated"" is a soft rock song about a boy who doesn't be himself. And ""Sk8er Boi"" is a punk-rock song about a girl who dumps a boy before getting to know him. It's great to listen to anytime. If you like Britney Spears & Pink, you'll love Avril Lavigne!"
3,Spend your money on something else,"The first couple of times you listen to this CD, it's not bad. After a while the novelty wears off and you realise that there are only 2 songs that could be considered as rock, and they rest are pop rubish.The instrumentation in the songs is poor. The guitar chords are very repetive throughout the whole album, and Lavigne sings the same notes in the same key for every song. Not to metion all of her songs seem to be based off the same experience. She doesn't appear to have any sort of range at all, and if she does she doesn't use it.So why three stars? Despite all my slurs, the first couple of songs on the album are good. Overall? Spend your money on something else."
1,Mi r3vu,"Do you like collections of virtually identical, completely fabricated songs about poseurs and 'being yourself?' Well, then if you can wade through the terrible, grating lyrics, the shrill voice and a modicum of flawed melodies, you can treat yourself to this overplayed mass-media catering pap. With the impressive lyrical flair of constant 'na na na nas' and 'yea-ee-aahs,' you'll never get tired of the mind-numbing repetition! It's also really cool to spell your song-names and lyrics with (outdated) internet speak."
2,Many People Have Different Opinions ...,"I have read reviews on this CD here, and also heard some opinions from people in real life. I have to agree that I do not like Avril Lavigne, she is a poser, and she cant sing live. But some people have to like her to have sold so many CD'S. Right? Or maybe people just buy her CD and realize its garbage I don't know. I guess I wouldn't buy this CD some songs are catchy like ""Complicated"" (possibly the best song on the CD) which made me want this CD a little while back but luckily my friend got it and we listened to it, I was disgusted. Some songs were brilliant others were bad. Miss Avril Lavigne is NOT going to go far in the music world - she has hardly any talent, shes a poser (possibly more fake then Britney Spears) and she should lend her songs to someone who CAN sing.Overall: The CD'S not too bad. The songs are OK. But Avril spoils it all."
4,Avril rocks!!!,"This album is a slice of music heaven. Though it does have some low points, like Too Much To Ask the rest makes up a great album. Sk8r Boi is a bouncy song about not judging people and the single Complicated makes good listening. Unwanted is a powerful song which I identify with totally. Anything But Ordinary is my anthem and I just love it. I gave it 4 stars because its not quite perfect but its so close!"
1,Another album deserving nothing more than 0 stars!,"Since this is NOT real music, it doesn't deserve to be rated on the same level as real music. Therefore, 0 stars all the way!!! Real music lasts forever. Just wait and see how many people will be listening to this in a year!"
5,Avril Lavigne is the BEST!,"I love this CD! The best song on it is I'm with you. It has such a good beat and good words compared to Rap CD's where they cuss and use insults in them. It always gives me chills when I hear that song ""I'm with you"" I listen to this CD a lot when I'm on the bus going to places and it makes it more enjoyable too. The other songs are good too and I don't care what others say about her not being good, she is a good artist and always will be. Keep up the good work Avril and you're so cute too :)"
5,Wonderfully Avril,Not pop Not punk Avril Lavigne is in a group all of her own in which she created and no one else can ever be apart of this young taltented artist is a simplely stupindous writer and a steller singer i have 2 copys of her cd and take it every where i go she is simple her self in a world of artisist who conform to consumer driven ideals she is an origanial and will stay this way i see her around for a very long time
5,Canadian goodness,"After seeing Avril's video on TRL, I knew I had to get her CD. When I bought it, I was dumbfounded. She has very profound lyrics and great guitar skills to boot. Her first and second singles are excellent, and the whole CD is pure gold. You MUST buy this!"
5,It Rocks!!!,"This Album is brilliant, great voice and great songs. I'll be honest, i wasn't sure if i'd like all the songs on the album, complicated i liked and sk8er boi. but thats all i'd heard, so got it on the off chance. But am well impressed by it!"
3,Think about it,"Okay to everyone who bashed the poor girl.....did you ever stop to think that maybe she DOES know how to skateboard and she is not a poser?? Do you know her personaly to say if she can or can not? Get a life and stop bashing others, it only makes you look imature and stupid. If you don't like her style just simply don't listen to her, change the station...is it really that hard? Even though she may seem a bit like pop, she has her own style and I think she is better than the puppets of the pop world that all look the same. At least she is a individual."
2,"The music is okay, but her image is not","this cd is not bad by any means. She has some talent so im not going to say that she doesnt. If you buy this CD because the music is cool , then great! But dont buy the CD because you think she is all origional and is ""different"" then the britneys and christinas... because she is not. If you want to buy the CD of someone who has talent and isint trying to be someone she isint buy Vanessa Carlton's CD, she is extremely talented and i have yet to see one sign of fakeness in her image... the same cannot be said for miss avril"
2,"awful music, awful lyrics.","I was intrigued by the hit song Complicated, so I decided to buy this album to hear more. Boy was I disappointed. To be fair, the target audience of this album is probably teenage girls and women in their early 20's so I should not be surprised that I disliked it. Despite the harsh music and airhead lyrics, there remains the fact that Avril Levigne has a mediocre voice at best. I swear I have heard people in kareoke bars sing better than her and in a couple of songs I actually thought she was tone-deaf. I don't know how she got her break-surely there are more talented aspiring singers out there? Does anyone think she would have made the top 5 in American Idol? No, this album isn't complicated, its overrated."
4,you guys,"Let's face it, today if a girl is singing a music genre that is mainly made up of men, then they are .all going to tell her that she's not who she claims to be. Which is not punk. You can be a punk and not sing punk music. i've never heard her claim to sing punk. Besides, if Blink 182 changed Skater Boy to Skater girl and sung it, punks out there would have been screaming the lyrics like no tommorow. The Rock Show is a very similar song to me. But the female voice makes it ""poppy"" sounding. Avril Lavigne is only 17 years old. She's already devoloped her voice and sings and writes her OWN music which is more than I can say for allot of other bands out there. Alanis Morrisette, Blink 182 and allot of other bands out there didn't hit it big with their first album but we don't dig out ""Budda"" and say how much it sucks. This is her first album, give her a chance to get a little older and come out with a few more album's before we throw her in the garbage. I think she has allot of potential"
5,Amazing Artist. A MUST buy!,"2 words. Avril rocks. Shes 17, sings, plays the guitar, and kicks butt. Her songs are meaningful, relatable, catchy, and not teen-sugar-bubble-gum-pop like most young singers these days. Her songs are relatable to teens everywhere, such as ""Losing Grip"", ""Unwanted"", ""Anything But Ordinary"" and ""Naked"". She also mixes in a little of her own funk with rockin' tracks such as ""Sk8er Boi"" and ""My World"". This is a definate must buy! I recommend it to everyone who likes music that comes from the (punkish) soul. Go get it today!~des"
4,All around good buy,"Avril Lavinge was lying when she said she was not ordinary. Her music, in fact, sounds very similar to most other songs, just (slightly) heavier. It is a mixture of Britney Spears, Pink and many other pop artists. Don't get me wrong, the songs are good, I especially like Skater Boy and Complicated, but if you are a non-pop type of person and looking for something punk, Avril Lavinge is not the way to go. If, however, you like pop, this is a pretty good CD, with really catchy tunes. Oh, and one other problem: She should hire someone to write the lyrics for her, they are somewhat immature."
5,A new rock revolution led by a female teen has begun...,"Avril Lavigne can certainly make a good rock record that would lift you six feet off the ground. As for me, I really love this CD; I never get bored listening to her, on the contrary, you'd simply fall in love with her music by every repeated listening. My favorites are ""Losing Grip"" and ""My World"", though I think all songs are all just as excellent.I believe this album would appeal to guys a lot; it has already carried me away. Finally I've found a good female voice that I can enjoy listening to.So, to all you guys out there: throw Britney Spears in the trash and rock along to Avril Lavigne instead! You'd love her more than all the Britney clones in the world!"
2,Here We Go!,"Avril Lavigne debut Let Go is a collection of meaningless, boring songs. There are not a one song that is really good on this album. the lyrics are imaturity and childish, the music which often is very cliche and indeed no originality to it.I Must say that I Give Arista and Laface records credit for discovering a girl and make her a big star overnight without taking off her clothes but indeed the music and the album stinks and I think the word punk rock is a bit stupid when it comes to this it's like saying that Britney Spears is a heavy metal act and she will be performing next Ozzfest. please give me a break."
5,Her album went platinum for a reason...,I know in a past review I said that Avril[...] and that it was only a phase but I deleted it to redo the review.I was swayed by a lot of my friends and others saying she was a poser and that she sucked so I started to believe it.But then I remembered the CD.I began to listen to it again and I love it.I have a few friends that secretly like Avril Lavigne and she is a guilty pleasure for them and secretly I like her too.Her songs are so good and she sings just dandy.Before I said she sucks live but she must have been having a bad day because I heard her again on Oprah and she was amazing!2 years ago I got the Let Go CD for Christmas and this year I am going to get her new CD for Christmas as well.With the exception of Mobile and Unwanted all the songs are amazing.
4,Talented Up And Coming Star,"I love this record. This album shows that teenagers can be talented and write and play their own music. The self-proclaimed skate punk, has it down; appealing to both guys and girls. Her music is kickin'; it has punk and rock meddlings but still pop enough to be played on radio; and without sounding over-produced and watered down. It sounds fresh; but it still has its lyrical points where it slips. But you got to give her credit; she's still a teenager, when she gets older and more mature, she will be one of the best singer/songwriters out there. but for now; 'Let Go' is a good introduction of whats to come."
1,Thank Goodness for Technology,"I heard Avril Lavigne ""sing"" live in concert last month. My God!Miss Lavigne should get down on her knees and thank the Lord for TC-Helicon's VoiceOne program, which allows sound engineers to modulate the pitch and timbre of the human voice, mainly so they can correct bad intonation and beef up a thin, puny voice. It's a godsend to talentless singers everywhere. Without it, Avril would have no recording career at all. She's that bad, folks.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to scrub the inside of my skull with boric acid and steel wool in a vain attempt to scour from my memory all traces of that dismal travesty of a concert. Oh, the humanity!"
1,Still Laughing......,"Avril makes the music industry a big huge joke! Her lyrics are kiddish, some of them don't even make any sense! If you wanna buy an Avril-like album go and buy Sum41. Because Sum41 has the same type of music but in a good form. Avril sounds like a dying cow! You could have hearing phobia for months (which I know hearing phobia isn't a word.) So anyway to wrap up this message: DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM BECAUSE YOU'LL WASTE EIGHTEEN DOLLARS ON CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A Terrible CD!!!!!!,Every time I hear Avril Lavigne I want to vomit! She claims that she isn't punk and then turns around and says that she is. Her songs are boring with childish lyrics and are disgraced with her terrible voice. She sings songs that have no meaning or depth. She is probably the most fake person in the music industry right now. Avril Lavigne needs to rethink the image that she's portraying because she looks like a poser and has lost the respect of everyone who is truly punk.
4,I will watch and wait.,"This album is a lot of *fun*. The songs are catchy, with good hooks and some really good lyrics. Not great lyrics, but good. There really isn't a song I dislike (which can't always be said for artists that I love and are respected), and I was quite haunted by ""I'm With You.""No, I don't think she's a genius, or god's gift to music. I could care less about her ""look"" or the fact that she claims to be ""punk"" and has *no* idea what that is.She's a teenager who's managed to find some outlet for her creativity, and done it more than reasonably well. And if her lyrics are sometimes a little juvinile for my taste...well...let's see what a couple more years do for her, eh?"
3,Pop Music's answer to Nirvana...,"Like when Nirvana came along to clean up the glam rock saturation of the early 90's, Avril Lavigne has come along to clean up the debris left behind from the recyclable teen pop scene.Avril Lavigne ""Let It Go"" sounds like they tried to take the pop beat and give it a harder rocking edge. This is certainly not my cup of tea, but Avril has potential to be a great success. For a hint in the future, I would like to see more harder rocking tracks similar to ""Losing Grip"" and ""Sk8er Boi,"" the hardest of the rockers, not the rest of the album which consists of mid-tempo acoustic songs with a pop beat."
3,Just buy the singles!!,"The tracks Losing Grip, Complicated, and Unwanted are the best songs on this album. The rest aren't necessarily unbearable...just average pop/rock songs I can hear from a local garage act. Nothing special here, folks! Just another overrated pretty face sitting or standing behind an instrument! It's great background music for doing homework or some other important task, because there's not too much difference between the songs. And by difference, I mean the tempo and sound is pretty much the same! Actually, let me take back the unbearable part..because I just remembered one song I absolutely can't stand. And that is Sk8er Boi! Not only is the spelling of the title silly, so is the song itself! Avril even attempts to rap in Nobody's Fool, but even that fails to capture my attention. If you're still dying to get this, just buy or download the singles!"
4,Great debut album but poorly edited.,"This is an impressive album from someone so young. It seems obvious that Avril Lavigne is meant to be a musician and is extermely talented. There is some truly great songwriting showcased here.My complaint is that the album seems poorly edited. It starts out with some very strong songs and then seems to get weaker as the album progresses. I believe this album would have been a stronger album if one or two of the weaker songs were left out.Also, the fidelity of the album seems slightly tinny sounding. I'm not sure if this is due to the instrumenation or to equalization in the studio.I would certainly recommend this CD for the great songs like Losing Grip, I'm With You and Complicated, Mobile and others, but know that there are one or two tracks that are less than memorable."
2,What can I say about Avril that hasn't already been said.,"While Avril did release one song that I really liked (""I'm With You""), she basically is another talentless and manufactured pop artist (think Britney). But aren't we all used to those by now? Her music is all about marketing, an image, and making money. How American for a Canadian!"
5,Bringing A New Style To Rock,"Avril Lavigne shows us that age knows no boundaries with her debut album ""Let Go"". She makes us think, ""what were we doing when we were 17?"" Unlike many singers out there these days, Avril writes her own songs, and very well at that. Her songs have versatility, and her lyrics show us that she isn't afraid to say what's on her mind.Saying Avril is ""pop-punk"" would be doing her an injustice. There are so many different styles of music on her album it would be impossible to fit her into one genre alone. There is some hard rock; Losing Grip, Unwanted, pop rock; Mobile, Complicated, and even a rap-like song; Nobody's Fool. It's no wonder her fan base is so strong and still growing. Be a part of that fan base. If you don't have this album yet, get it NOW. NOW!"
5,avril lavigne,"Canadian native, Avril Lavigne, continues to pick up new fans everyday with her debuet album Let Go. Her hit single ""complicated"" is all over tv and the radio. It even reached #1 on Mtv's TRL. Her cd is full of hits that will touch all teens(esspecialy young women). Lavigne writes all her own music and bursts out every one of them with her amazing talent. Each song is powered but her amazing band that gets your head bobbing. With punk influenced songs like ""Sk8ter Boy"" to mellow songs like ""i'm with you Lavignes cd, Let Go, diserves a listen."
5,Great CD,This was a great CD. I enjoyed all of the songs and I think that most of were really meaningfull. The music was great and Avril has an outstanding voice. There is a great variety of music types which is what makes her music so enjoyable for everyone. Avril is an outstanding singer and has an outstanding CD that I think you should check out!
4,Awesome!,This CD is one of my faves! All the songs are amazing(except for 1 or 2). It's definatley worth your money to go out and buy it. Trust me!
2,why?,"people think avril is diferent. avril thinks avril is difrent. cloud thinks avil is BOR-RING. her sogs are fine, the guitar playing is so/so, there are two aspects of av-ey that bug me. one: she just another soft spoken pop-princes. two: that she sells her self by looking like a skater-punk but her songs are more fit for alicia keys! it you really want original pick up some vitamin C or sheilla nicholls or eve or india arie. or someone who deosnt need the clothes or looks cause they have tallent."
3,Very confused...,"Now, this is only based on seeing the one video for ""Complicated"". I woke up this morning and put on Mtv, and there was this girl- She looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but the song sounds kinda country (I could see LeeAnn or somebody singing it), and she was all dressed in punk clothes and there was skating happening... And it looked like she had Aaron Carter as a guitarist? Then they trashed a mall?Now maybe I'm too old for this stuff (26), but I just *don't* get it....By the end of the video, I had kinda gotten into it, but it hasn't stayed in my head all day. In fact, I couldn't remember the name of the song. The only lyric that stuck was ""And you fall and you crawl and you take what you get""... Oh well.Let me see another video, I'm a little interested. Not going to run out and get the cd just yet though."
4,Fun!,"This CD... hmmm... well, the music is great pop, and the lyrics are simple and catchy, but there are some idiosyncrasies. It kind of bothers me that Avril, even though she sort of rubs your face in the whole ""I don't believe in labels"" thing, is always emphasizing the differences between ""skaters"" and ""preps""... it's just sort of hypocritical, I think. Oh, and on TV and stuff... why is it necessary for her to proclaim that she is a ""skater punk"" every other sentence? I think she has some identity issues.But, oh, well, it's all in good fun, right?Buy this CD, it's awesome and fun."
5,Great All Around Album...,"This one is now a family favorite and on a recent 12 hour road trip (each way), I believe we played it at least 20 times through... Even my wife likes it! and the kids (8,6,3) were singing along with my wife and I and dancing in their seats in the back of the mini-van..Probably not the audience Avril was looking for.. but she has a killer sweet and clear voice, her lyrics and music have solid melody and it's just fun music to listen to...You need this one..."
2,"Hmmmm... If the plastic is off, can I get a refund?",Can someone who doesn't know the roots of punk really be good at it?Why do people who can't perform live call themselves performers?Why do people who can't play guitar pose with them?Does it sound like I am hating?...Can I get that refund?
2,Another [One]??,"This Cd is all right..when I first saw Complicated on mtv i thought she was supposed to be punkrock but when i listened to the cd most of it was ssssooo pop. okay some songs are really tight like s8kter boy and complicated is okay and she is a pretty good artist if she just quit trying to be punk(and hogging up the spotlight) So anyway don't buy the cd unless you want ta listen to a pop ""princess ... punk!"
1,Hello......,"my name is John i like System Of A Down. Avril redid a song of theirs and i thought it sounded stupid. No need to say anymore, everything bad about her has already been said"
3,She ain't Britney...but she'll get there,"First off, let me just say that Da Peace Dogg has lots of respect for this new artist - nuthin' but luv. I've seen her perform on t.v. live a few times, and I can't believe a girl that young can already be so talented. Having said that, though, I also must say that Avril Lavigne gots a long way to go 'till she matches the status of Britney Spears. Britney's latest has sold 3.8 million units, well on its way to 4 million copies!! And what's this one sold? Maybe 500,000 units. Big deal, it's a gold record. In order to make it in da biz, you gots to sell those records, doggz....Also, to match the status of Spears, you gots to lay down phat beats and dance a little more, plus sing lots of naughty-styled lyrics that come from da heart. This chick just ain't as genuine and troo as my girl Britney, but give her time cuz she could someday be on level with Ms. Spears.She's pretty talented!!"
4,good,Losing Grip 9/10 FineComplicated 10/10 ExellentSk8ter Boi 9/10 Cool musicI'm With You 8/10 OKMolble 10/10 GreatUnwanted 4/10 Kinda dumbTomorrow 7/10 Could have been betterAny thing but ordinary 9/10 goodThings i'll never say 10/10 my favoriteMy world 9/10 coolNobody's fool 9/10 fineToo much to ask 6/10 OKNaked 8/10 Crazy
3,I love This Cd,"I've owned this cd since it first came out and love it. With songs like ""Unwanted"" that is a athem for anyone who has all ways been the outkast. and ""St8er Boi"", ""Complcated"", and ""Things I'll Never Say"" that you can't help but sing along to. The only reason I giving this 3 stars is because she is just acting a little to immature. Her new one is one of the best CDs I own and trust me I own a lot of them."
5,Avril's Awesome!!!,"I like Avril because she's cool, i can relate to her music and she's her own person! I love the way she dresses , i like her attitude and her lyrics are so truthfull and have meaning to them. I love the song ""complicated"" and my other three favorite songs that i just love to sing are ""nobodys fool"" "" losing grip"" and ""unwanted"". I just love those lyrics to those songs! but other then that her cd is nice! Avril I love ya girl! Keep rockin!!"
2,hollow,"If you want a cd with catchy songs that aren't very deep or meaningful (you probably like Britney Spears) then this cd is for you. But for those of us who require a bit more in our music... move on... This isn't punk it's not even skater, it's the music industry trying to get the next big ""anti-britney"" star. 2 stars because she can rhyme."
2,whatever rocks your boat...i guess,"This girl is so overwhelmed with her own ""punkness"" its embarrassing.She trashes Britney Spears for no reason at all. Britney Spears somebody whose shouldn't even matter to her because i mean she's pop and Avril soo punk right? Britney Spears has a song called Boys and she has a song called Sk8er Boy? I mean come on! Sk8er Boy?! She should just be herself. In her song Complicated she complains about ppl who are ""fake"". Mabye Avril should take her own advice. I listen to punk music. I really like punk music and i have punk friends..but that doesn't mean i am a PUNK because i mean thats just not me. I think Avril is very confused and it shows in her songs. She sounds (and dresses) like she really wants to be a punk (she REALLY wants to) but isnt so sure about it. The result a half-[baked] record."
1,Yeah - whatever,"Can you say annoying? Lets lay out all my problems so I can make everyone miserable. Yuck!! And what is with ""Sk8er Boi""??? Who came up with that spelling? Big Bertha in Special Ed.?? Why can't anyone in the music career have actual talent??"
1,Queen of Poseurs,"She can say she's punk all she wants. She can go wear a tie all she wants. She can win all the awards she wants. She can let other people write most of her music all she wants. She can grab the attention of 7th graders all she wants. She can also grab my brother's attention all she wants. She can pretend that her songs are really hers and that she wasn't massively aided by people in the studio. (Look at the insert, ""written by Lavigne and... [Insert name here]). She can also say that she plays the guitar. Looking at the music videos she doesn't really, or plays as least amount of chords as possible. Well that sums up a lot of it. Oh yeah, she can say she doesn't suck when in reality, we've already heard this before and it SUCKS VERY VERY VERY HARD. She can also say this isn't cliché, but I think you can guess what I can say about that."
1,Hey guys this is my 3rd negative review for Avril.....,GO ME!!!!! keep up the negative reviews folks.
1,GIMME A BREAK!,"Gimme a break! Avril Lavigne sucks. Don't waste your money on this crap. It's not worth it. I give every song on this CD an F and a 0/10. Get real people, her music is horrible! She claims to be punk-rock, when she's really just pop. I am not suprised that she hasn't made a second album. I am just warning the helpless, don't waste your money on this! Avril is also a poser and a loser. She is so phoney, no wonder people buy her stuff!"
1,This Album Should Die,"This is a pop album, not rock. Deluded fans take note! I would call it humorous but it just annoys me. Can't sing, the voice is singing and beyond tuneful.The songs are horrid and cringeful. Who would call a song sk8er boi with serious face? The lack of dignity is shocking.I can't beleive someone would put a song as bad as 'naked' on an album. And i'd be embarassed if 'mobile' was on my album.Though I must praise Avril for starting the craze of long straight hair and tomboy clothing for teenage girls, it means I can wear my fairy clothes without embarassment. I love my fairy clothes.A girl living opposite my house loves this album. She plays it loud sometimes. Pity me please."
2,Poser,"Yeah, i like the songs, they're actually pretty ok, but I agree with everyone that she is ver un-punk, her clothes are wannabe, and she should just say ""this is pop"" and be done with it. I give it more stars except for someone who is trying to be herself, she isnt. This cd is nothing special, dont waste ur money."
4,Good CD overall,"This is an excellent CD for this genre of music. You can listen to the entire CD without skipping any tracks, which is a rarity most of the time.The music is well done, for the most part. Sometimes she edges towards punk music, as in ""Sk8er Boi."" Her lyrics are good for someone so young, but sometimes her age shows through. Some of the lyrics are a bit immature, but what do you expect from a 17 year old? This is not the case in all of her songs, and most of the songs are very strong lyrically.My favorite track is ""Losing Grip,"" but like I said before, all of the songs are worth a listen."
2,this makes me go hmmm,"well i thnk that what avril was trying to do here is be ""rebelius"" and still make millions. and she did that by dresing as a skater/punk and singing as a prep. that way she apeals to everyone, right? not really. to me that sounds like reversed logic.her songs in thems selves could be much better but are generaly lisnable and easy to realate to, so what the problem? well one would be that she manages to confuse us with her melded styles. another is that we have no way to really classify her. so she goes as a poser. well luckily only ""people magazine"" made the mistake of calling her music punk (play that punk-ey music)what I'm attempting to say is, sure buy the CD,but expect rude coments.some where i read that she sounded like gwen from no doubt. that make me laugh. i'de like to see her try and pull a song like ""trapped in a box"" and ""oi to the world."""
1,waste of time and money,"Avril is a disgrace to rock and punk. How can you call someone whodoesn't cuss exept for like two songs because her mother doesn't like it a rebel?And all she sings about are boyfriends and love.If she didn't call herself punk and didn't diss other popstars exactly like her i wouldn't care.Avril lavigne is only an excus for little girlswho all they care about are their nails to say they listen to punk rock and are punk while they listenin pop.They play her in limited 2 all the time.I mean I can't play guitar but I don't go around telling everybody I do, when I so obviously can't"
2,"Not a "" Complicated "" kind of music","Avril Lavigne is one of those artists who believes that music and self expression is easily achieved, my belief is that, though such a loose evolving step in music ( like much junk out there ), the music is so easy to digest and to listen that it makes an unfair attempt in reveal her true persona, personally, if i were to listening punk i'd listen Black Flag ( of course, that IS punk )or the Exploited or the Birmingham Crass, but anyway that's something people does not see and therefore does not understand easily, so, buy it if you want, but do not expect a manifesto or a political or mental revolution"
4,I love it!,I really like this cd but some times she sounds like she has an acent. Other times she over sings or is a little off key. Other than that It is a great cd! I listen to it all the time! I thank it is a really good deal and would make the perfect gift!
1,This is BRILLIANT!,"What are all you Avril haters complaining about? Are you not listening to the amazingly brilliant lyrics on this album? To quote one particularly inspired chorus:""Uh huh, uh huh, uh huhMy life's like thisUh huh, uh huh, uh huhThat's the way it is""See? Not just any moron could write such moving lyrics! Keep up the good work Avril!"
1,Let Avril Go...,"I have been perplexed by the success of this wannabe poser, who claims to be ultra-talented and so ""cutting edge"". Please.... Avril Levine is another one of those flashes in the pan, who happened to get a good album producing team. For all of you who think Avril is so ""brilliant"" for coming up with this new sound, please give credit where it is due: her producers. It drives me crazy when singers proclaim their own genius--and neglect to admit that their sound is completely fabricated by their production team. Madonna is another one of these types."
1,Drop an anvil on Avril,"She said it best herself in her lame little song... ""It's all been done before"". You sure got THAT right. Someone needs to tell this little pep-rally prep she's not hardcore. She needs to get it thru her Easy-Bake-Oven-head that she's really just Britney with clothes on.If Avril is punk, then Shania Twain is deathmetal."
3,Good effort...,"I'd have to agree that a lot of people need to give her a break. I really don't care if she's a ""poser"" or whatever some people claim, I care more about that she doesn't seem to be the brightest person in the world. And yes, she's manufactured, but so is 1/2 the pop industry and even some of the rest of the entertainment industry. Sure she can hardly play guitar, the lyrics really aren't too deep, but I must say I enjoyed the album. I especially enjoyed ""Losing Grip"", ""Tomorrow"", ""I'm With You"" and ""Things I'll Never Say"". As a person, I'm not too sure I'd enjoy hanging out with her. But I didn't mind her album too much. Give it a try."
4,Lures you into excellent rating then falls flat!,"Starts off with some great tracks, Complicated, I`m with you, but that is all screwed up by teenage angsty tracks like Skater Boy which personally does not work for me. She has definitely got talent and its pretty easy to listen to but only a few songs really pull me in"
4,Sweet,"The cd of this new talent, is really good, the songs are nice and the lyrics too, i think that Avril isnt just a one hit wonder, probably she will stay a long time, BUT, i think that the last songs of the album aren't as great as the first ones, but if you wanna hear something new, buy it, you might be surprised."
2,"Something ""Small Kids"" would listen 2.....","Well, her record is cool, except I would classify it as ""play"" rock- if there is such thing. I dig Losing Grip (Though it sounds distinctly familiar......), Tomorrow, Anything But Ordinary, And My Wold. There are 13 tracks in all, so I guess it would we worth buying. But as of the moment, m really SIK of Complicated already, but it sounded nice when I first heard it. Sk8er Boi (Skater Boy would have been better) [is bad]! As in, lotsa songs sound exactly like it. My Advice to you is this- Yeah sure, she's pretty and all, but you could spend your money on something better......"
1,one and a half star because she plays guitar...,"I applaud this youngster for creating on real insturments instead of just hiring a guy to lay down a bunch of lazy electronic nothing. That said,it's about all that sets this apart from the rest of the lackluster music that everybody seems to love. It's the same old same old-but god bless you if it bakes your bread. Her youthful ""sexuality"" is on display here,if in a much more dignified way than Miss Spears. If you think it's not you're fooling yourself. For once when you say the lyrics sound like they are the poetry of a teenage girl it's really true. Man these are some boring and simple words set to very average musical backing. These songs are lightweight and full of ""attempted"" depth. All I can say is that maybe she will grow up with her fans and make some music that's got some meat to it. Sk8 on down to the record shop and try again."
1,Jealous?,"Jealous? Not really. Just puzzled and deeply annoyed.I can't answer for others, but what annoys me is that there are LOTS of other, far more talented people who will NEVER get the promotion and publicity they deserve. (And I'm NOT talking about myself or any members of my family.) When someone with no discernable talent whatsoever gets this kind of insane saturation promotion by the record industry, it's a fair question to ask why. There are girls at my local high school who can sing and dance and play guitar much better that Avril can. So, like an earlier reviewer asked, WHY HER?"
5,Let Go,"Avril Lavigne's debut album is full of songs that teenagers can relate to. In a world where pop music is all about sex, and punk music is all about jerks, Avril finds a balance and adds her own touch. Everything is straight from the heart, and something all teens can understand. My favourite song is #1, Losing Grip. It's about being betrayed by somebody who should have been there and wasn't. Now come on, who *hasn't* had that happen?"
5,brilliant!,"this is a brilliant album!i agree that anybody who wants that 'punk' style she claims to have will be a little dissapointed.However,you will struggle to find a bad song.Songs such as thing's I'll never say, my world and I'm with you are really great songs."
1,Just the Facts,"Here are the facts:She doesn't write her own music. A team of professionals is commissioned by the record label to compose the music for her.She doesn't play an instrument. She is obviously faking her guitar playing on stage, because the chords and rhythms she is strumming don't even match the songs she's singing.She can't sing. I've heard her perform live and she sounded really lousy--completely out of tune and harsh. On her albums, the record company has obviously corrected her bad singing using hi-tech computer programs to cover up her totally inadequate voice.There are so many real musicians and songwriters out there. Don't waste your money on this phony."
1,<----- Should say 0!!!,"The only good thing about Avril Lavigne is that one day, she (along with countless others) will go belly-up, just like Tiffany, NKOTB, Backstreet Boys, and the many others that have done so before her. But really, what can I say about Avril that hasn't been said millions of times before? We all know she's a talentless poser created by the industry to cash in on ridiculous fads, right? I predict her next album ""Under My Skin"", will be her last. Truely, I cannot wait for the day that this madness will end. Avoid her like the plague!!!"
4,i expected more...more like a 3.5,"I listened to thie first five tracks of this cd on Amazon and they were good. Damn good. Track six is awesome, too; but then the slowly get worse and worse....until you end on the very good closing song, ""Naked.""1) Losing Grip - 10/102) Complicated - 10/103) Sk8ter Boi - 10/104) I'm With You - 9/105) Mobile - 10/106) Unwanted - 10/107) Tomorrow - 3/108) Anything But Ordinary - 2/109) Things I'll Never Say - 6/1010) My World - 1/1011) Nobody's Fool - 5/1012) Too Much to Ask - 7/1013) Naked 9/10"
5,Punk or Super Star?,AVRIL LAVIGNE IS A SUPER STAR! Being from Canada makes her voice sound uniqe and absouloutly singer material. Her tune is awsome and her voice is too! It doesn't matter what she wears because she is famous for her voice. I highly recomend this CD!
1,True Creative Mastery.,"Creativity abounds on this album. Avril Lavigne is the perfect representative for the angst-ridden punk girl, and she sings and writes songs like she knows it. While sporting a white wife-beater and tie, it's like she's speaking directly to the youth of today. As she bellows out powerful lyrics like ""Why should I care?"", and sings about issues that affect all of us, especially in such a confusing time, one can literally feel her as a guide to our nation, a true light in the darkness that engulfs our world of poseurs and hypocrites. Way to go, Avril!"
1,Crap In It's Purest Form,"What more need I say, this is utter garbage. Avril is in it just for the money, and attention. The marketing industries think that is she dresses ""punk"" than these teeny boppers will think that it really is. Yes, this was directed at all of you Avril loving teenage girls that think Avril and Good Charlotte and hard-core as you like to call it. Punk used to be about rebellion and anarchy, not love relationships. You posers should learn what REAL hard-core music is, like hard-core METAL and PUNK. Stuff like The Misfits is REAL punk, but that might make your virgin ears bleed. And my favorite metal band, CRADLE OF FILTH!!!!!! Go listen to them you darn teeny boppers and tell me what you think, you have my sympathy and regards however.I know that review by Stacey was a long time ago, but if you are reading this Stacey,I just wanted to inform you that your review made me vomit."
3,Give her a chance.,"Most people love Avril or hate her. She's comparable to Michelle Branch, though Michelle is a little more genuine and talented. Avril can also be described as a mini Alanis Morissette because she's Canadian but Alanis is also more genuine and talented.Avril Lavigne gives off a strong poser vibe with annoying tracks like ""Complicated"" and ""Sk8er Boi"" but she does show promise. ""Losing Grip"" is pretty good. ""I'm With You"" is an awesome track though the lyrics aren't that great. ""Mobile"" and ""Naked"" are also nice tracks that distingiush Avril Lavigne from other bubblegummy pop artists. To be honest those are the only tracks I've listened to since I just bought the album today. This album is worthwhile if you pay under $10 for it."
1,Well . .. .,"People have told me that the only reason I hate Avril is becuase I dislike her image. They say I should listen to her for her music. What they are missing is that her music is really not that good. Her voice isn't so bad, but after a few songs I get so annoyed I can't think. Her music to me just sounds corny. Her songs don't really have any depth at all. I just don't like the sound of them. Usually, the gutair is my favorite part of a song, but not in this album. It just sounds . . .blah. So, in conclusion, I do not like Avril becuase her music is terribly bad. Sorry."
5,Let go of other cd's and pick up this one,"I first heard Avril's single complicated and was intersted in the rest of the songs. I heard that the cd was out so i went and bought it. As soon as I listened to the cd i didn't take it out of the cd player in my car. I listened to all the song, but my favorite is sk8rboi. All the songs have some great tunes to it and some good lyrics. I think everyone out there should go and pick up the cd. Avril Lavigne is a great singer for someone her age, and has written some great songs that have feelings that kids around the age of 17 can relate to."
5,WoRTh MOrE THaN What IT's PriCed At :),"I recently purchased AVril's cd LET GO and I simply LUVED it!! The first track on the cd is my favorite it's called ""LOSING GRIP"", I was really surprised that the album had more of a pop/rock type of sound; since she obviously exerts more of a punk rock image. Avril's cd definitely proves her musically diverse mentality. The background music is familiar and similar to that of the CRANBERRIES who are really AWESOME. SO OVER ALL I THINK THIS SONG ROCKS !!!! its mellow and her songs are really easy to relate to, lyrics are great NO CLICHEes, no dum meaningless pop lyrics, its ALL REAL, ANd YOU 'll knOw it TOO AFTer YOU GO OUT and BUY THe CD and LISTEN To It ! :) HEr talent is PricelESs and certainly worth more than 15 BUCKS SO YOU""LL GET UR MONEY""S WORTH .. EASY !!"
5,"""Let Go"" of the urge and buy this album!...","This album is amazing. Avril Lavigne is one of the most talented artist that I have heard in a while. She is one of a string o talented singer/songwriters coming out right now, but she is slightly different from the rest of them; she has attitude. I originally bought this album because it was [inexpensive], but when I actually listened to the CD, I realized that I got my money's worth; it's worth much more than that. Her voice is up there with Alanis Morissette and Natalie Merchant, with the hipness of Michelle Branch, Fiona Apple, and a young Sheryl Crow. Each track on this album is completely different from each other, so you get to taste the range of talent this young woman has. She can range from a popish sound, to an alternative sound, all the way to a hard rock sound; this album has music for everyone. I suggest that everyone should buy this album, or at least give it a chance."
4,Never Mind the Bollocks...,"Forget about the image. Forget about whether she is or is not a ""punk"" or a ""phony"". Forget about whether she did or did not write the songs, or whether she can or cannot play.The fact is, this is a strong debut CD, with very little filler. While some of the lyrics sound like they were written by a 16 year-old (lending support to the argument that she did at least HELP to write the songs), it does not overshadow the fact that the playing is tight and the hooks are catchy. She handles the ballads and the up-tempo material with equal skill.View this for what it is...a very good POP disc that you should not feel ashamed to own. Nothing more. Nothing less. And sometimes, especially in light of the Jeschritney Simpspaguilera product that is still out there, that is not a bad thing."
2,Let Go,"Well first of all Avril Lavigne is pop not punk-rock Even if you hate her you got to admit she's got catchy songs and some of them are good But honestly ""Anything but Ordinary"" is kinda of dumb saying stuff like ""Sometimes I get so wierd,I even freak myself out"" Her CD is great to people who like pop but to the rock-punk people not really ""Sk8ter Boi"" is the only song on Let Go close to punk While ""Unwanted"" is the most rock you'll probarly hear on this CD As for Avril she is kinda fake.She dresses punk and says am tough and stuff but sings pop but well some people do that and I don't really have a big problem with it.She coulden't play guitar before but all of a sudden she plays better noe as for her voice live She used to suck and really bad but now her voice at live perfomances is better But if your into Britney Spears this is great cd>It's just pop with a few guitars on the back"
5,WOW!!!,"Avril is amazing! I love her ""Let Go"" CD. It is the one CD i own on which i love every song! Her crystal clear voice and totally original style makes this CD woth picking up any day. She writes all her own music that is about things everyone can relate to and it blows the mind that she is so young and can write and sing such great songs. The future hits that this album has on it are definatly ""Losing Grip"", ""Anything but Ordinary"", ""My World"", and ""Sk8ter Boi"". I recomend this CD to anyone who is willing to listen to this amazing new female artist with a outstading voice, and a truly original style"
5,This cd kicks all form of ass,"hey, i bought the cd the tue it came out. At first the only word i could use to describe it was, ""Wow"". It was so amazing. I love the way she totally puts her heart and soul into the lyrics. Theres no guesswork, I LOVE IT!My favorite song on the cd is ""Too Much To Ask"", because i've been going through the same thing. Its so crazy..."
5,Incredible voice,"I do not like the new teenage pop queens, but heard Avril perform ""Sk8er Boi"" on a TV show, and liked her music. The first time I heard ""I'm With You"", I almost immediately bought this album. I have never regretted it. This is a terrific album, and Avril has one of the best voices in popular music today. She blows the rest away! I highly recommend this album."
4,Check it out,"WOW!,You`ll be a fool if you miss out on this one.If you like complicated and sk8tr boy you will love all this amazing tracks.Wicked!!!!"
5,The Best CD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let go, is a well thought out CD for all listeners. That CD is stuck in my CD player and will not come out!!! I listen to it all the time. It's an excellent buy, for an Excellent CD, written by an Excellent artist. The CD features the hit single ""Complicated"" as well as ""Sk8er boi"" and ""Losing Grip"". To sum it up, Avril Lavigne has some excellent songs on her CD and as for some CD's where you only listen to 9 or 10 somgs out of 15, on this CD there is nothingf anybody could dislike, you will find yourselt listening to all 13 songs in your car, and at home! if you have any additional questions, feel free to email me at any time! If you came this far to check out the CD then why not buy it and listen to the music that you will love for the next year or two (or until her new CD comes out...)Make the right choice... we've all heard britney before and hey it's a good CD but now, let's take this new artist for a test Drive!!!!"
5,AMAZING,"i think this is the best album out there right now, it is one of the only albums i own that i can listen to the entire album each and every song and not get sick of, i just went to the canada day jam and she was wicked she has a lot of energy, i think she will be around for along time. i hope she comes back to toronto soon.much love to u allAVRIL RULES"
4,Great mix of a great bunch of female artists,"I bought this CD because my friend and I fell in love with ""Complicated"" and ""I'm With You."" I bought the CD, and what I heard was what sounded like a mix of Alanis Morissette, Gwen Stefani (Sk8er Boi), Michelle Branch, Pink, and I am sure a bunch of other artists I am leaving out. ""Complicated,"" ""My World"", and ""Anything But Ordinary"" are my favorite tracks. If you like the artists listed above, you'll love Avril. This is a great CD to sing with and if you are a lover of female rock artists, the CD is definitely worth buying"
4,"Overall, a good album","Where do I start? Avril Lavigne is a very talented new artist whom I predict will be HUGE. First of all, she has amazing vocal talent. Her voice is very pretty and yet powerful, and she has an incredible vocal range, which she shows in ""Anything But Ordinary"" and ""Losing Grip"". (Losing Grip is my personal favorite :).) She has a catchy and unique sound that goes far beyond that of ""Complicated"". It's girly and yet tough and punky at the same time. The reason I didn't give it all 5 stars is because of her lyrics. Some of her lyrics sound a LITTLE bit thrown-together (mainly ""Too Much to Ask""). Then again, it's her first album, plus she's a teenager who's all about self-expression. Anyway, overall, I think it's a great album."
4,Shows a lot of promise. . . .,"Avril Lavigne's CD, ""Let Go"", is a very good CD on it's own, and shows a lot of promise for what is to come in Lavigne's musical career. The riffs and music behind Lavigne's honest and forceful words makes this album a must have for any music listener who likes to just kick back, put on a CD, and relax. ""Let Go"" is also a CD that does not stick to one consistant musical flow, as the upbeat riffs behind Lavigne's ""Complicated"", ""Sk8er Boi"", and ""Losing Grip"" are complimented well by the slower, calmer music behind tracks such as ""I'm With You"" and ""Tomorrow"". All in all, ""Let Go"" is a very good CD that I'd suggest to anyone with an interest in pop/rock music."
4,A strong debut,"This might make me sound like a dork, but even though i'm a guy, i really enjoy chick rock a great deal. This album gets the formula right, without falling into the classic rock cliches. While it lacks the depth of lyrics of some of the recent releases from other female artists, it still contains a great deal of pep and energy, which contributes greatly to the enjoyment of the album. It gets off to a rocking start with ""Losing Grip"" and doesn't stop until the end. Avril will definitely benefit from more life experience and more practice at songwriting. That said, this is still a very strong start. I recommend this to album to anyone who is a fan of the likes of Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton, or Heather Nova. A very enjoyable experience indeed..."
5,This is Excellent!,"Avril Lavigne is amazing! With her famous pop-rock songs ""Complicated"" and ""Sk8er Boi"" and others which are definately as good and some that are better (unwanted) this CD is a must have.. GO CANADA!!!"
5,THE NEXT SUPERSTAR?,"Great CD! She has a lot of feeling in her lyrics. She will have you hooked when listening. Woke up this morning with ""I'm with you"" playing in my head. A ""GOT TO HAVE"" album! By the way, I'm in my 40's and have followed music for a long time and this is gotta be the best new material to come out in a long time! From a ""old rocker"" to the younger ones, this is a must have!"
4,Totally Cool!,"I'm not usually into the people who every one likes because I usually don't like their songs, but Avril has greats song I love ""Complicated"" and ""Anything but Ordinay"" they are how I feel some times. Avril writes songs sometimes about not eing like every one else which is why I like her songs and maybe even if she didn't do it on purpose her songs are easy to sing with. If you want any more recomodaion on the radio on My 94.1(countdown for year 2002) ""Complicated"" was the number one hit for year 2002.Alot love Avrils songs so I would highly suggust it for all."
3,A pretty good C.D.,"Okay, so everyone says that this is the best album on the planet.I sort of agree. Complicated and Skater Boi have had thier chances on the radio times a million. ""Losing Grip"" is easilly the best track on here. Naked is a close second and Mobile is third. I'm with you rates at the mid-way point but other than that her songs aren't all they're supposed to be. Punk is new and some people might try to like her and I agree that Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton need to measure up.However, if you really want to buy this and your birthday money's going towards it my advice is...don't buy it!!!!"
5,Avril Lavigne brings a bang,Let go has become one of the greatest cd's I've ever listened to. This 17 yr old girl has so much talent its to hard to handle. She's so sassy but unbelievably cute. She has her own unique style and she would be a great role model for children as well as teens. She speaks her mind on this cd for example the song anything but ordinary she says she wants to be anything but ordinary she has changed my life so far and I'm sure she will influence many more. From one band member to another she has what it takes. I believe this beauty has a long life line in the world of music. This cd makes you want to be you and not listen to other people. This cd will be played in my stereo for a long time until she comes out with another cd.
5,avril lavgine-let go,"i have also bought this album of avril lavigne's and i thought the album was good.i thought the album was put together very well,the songs on there are very good and very well put together.i recommend people to buy this album it is worth the wait.so i would like to thank amazon for having this album in stock i will continue to buy items off your website.sincerly chrisfan."
2,"Even minus her reputation, the CD isn't that great.","Alright, this CD is not punk. It is pop. And a mediochre pop CD at that.It's good for humming along and tapping your toes. It is not good if you are looking for music with meaningful lyrics or moving melodies (in fact, lyrics such as ""I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon"" make me outright laugh.)Personally, I think you should listen to a CD if you like the music, regardless of what other people say about the artist. Period.And I'll admit, I actually used to listen to this CD a lot when I was, say, 15. But I've matured and so have my music tastes.Avril Lavigne is only good for so long. You eventually out-grow her, as you do with all empty music."
2,Nothing special,"Avril Lavigne's debut album is a cheesy, extremely shallow pop cd. It's catchy, of course (The choruses are bound to stay in your head for das after the first listen), and her vocals are unique and quirky, but the lyrics are the most immature, akward lines I can think of. The ""deeper"" she tries to be, the plainer and more moronic it gets. I found the album average and boring."
5,"Great Singing, Great Guitar!","Avril is a great singer. She plays the guitar awesome too. Don't listen to all of these people who say that you shouldn't buy her music because of her image. Buy it because it sounds good. Trust me, I bought it, and I love it. You should too. She's not a phony. All of the people who say she is, they are just jealous. If people stop buying her music, then there won't be any more new Avril cds. Then all the good music will be gone! So please, listen to me, buy her cds, and convince other people to do the same."
5,"Bad Image, Good Music","It is true that Avril's image is somewhat laughable, but her music is not. ""Losing Grip"" ""I'm With You"" ""Mobile"" ""Tomorrow"" ""Anything But Ordinary"" ""Things I'll Never Say"" ""My World"" and ""Nobody's Fool"" all outdo the major hit ""Complicated"" and showcase an up and coming talent that could bloom into something of a Melissa Etheridge phenomenon. She is certainly a sink or float case that could either take off like a rocket in years to come or sink fast."
5,Avril Lets Go: America make room for this canadian!,"Avril Lavigne is the ultimate rockstar. With her current single ""complicated"" being rotated and as of last week being #2 on TRL, Avril is making a pretty good name for herself. Her debut cd ""let go"" features ballads like ""I'm with you"" and ""naked"", while she rocks on with ""my world"", ""sk8ter boi"", and ""mobile"". Her lyrics include life of an adolecent looking forward toward womanhood, this relates to every tennage girl in the country. Avril's new disc is basically diary into her mind. She seems more of real artist because she even wrote all of her songs and plays a guitar! How more real can you get? Avril is awesome and she is #1 in my book. Best of Luck to her."
1,STOP THE HORROR,"first of all, avril is an awful singer. on her CD she sounds prettey good, but live shes terrible. i've heard her live and it sounds like a dying chicken. they just change her voice and make it sound good on her CD. buying this CD was an absolute waste of money because at this point, hilary duff and britney spears sing better than her. DONT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Vomit inducing!,"All you stupid MTV loving pop obcessed people like this ****. It's what they're trying to get you to buy so you can fall into the new trend of ""punk."" I bet none of you little ****s have ever even heard of anarchy.....haha you probably think it's something you can buy at hot topic. Avril's ""music"" has no depth or meaning in it, and all it is is pop. yes, that's right:pop. And she doesn't even completley write her own songs. All avril is is a spoiled brat who wishes she was a punk rocker. She says she's into hardcore, yet she likes greenday and sum 41.Face it: Punk is dead. Sure, there are still people fighting for anarchy and going against what this blasted society of ours wants, but the music is dead. Avril helped kill it.And yes, for your information i AM under 13. Have a nice ****ing day"
2,"For Something So New, It Got Old Fast","I liked this CD the first five times I listened through it. After that, all the songs started to sound the same and I realized how annoying her voice got. Her lyrics are less than original and no where near creative.Doesn't really take a genius to rhyme 'red' with 'head.' Example: ""My cheeks are turning red"" to ""I'm searching for the words inside my head"" (taken from Things I'll Never Say).The beat gets repeatitive. And what really ticks me off is the fact she yodels in ""I'm With You."" If you can't carry a note for that long, just soften it up or edit it out. Don't butcher a good song by sounding like you have the hiccups.Note to all those judging her image: This isn't a picture. It's a CD. A CD has music on it. Listen to the CD before you critize (sp?) the music and artist. So what if she says she's punk and doesn't sing it, she can say she's a donkey for all I care. She's a singer, not a role model. It's the music that counts anyways."
4,I'm an old lady...,"...but I really dig Avril's CD. Is that strange? I don't care for her baggy pants/skater attitude, but the music is great! Funny as it sounds, Sk8ter Boi is my favorite song on that CD. There are few CDs that I can listen to all the way through, but I can this one. Whether you're a fan or hers or not, the music is really catchy and ejoyable to listen to.By the way, I'm 37. I can stil enjoy new music!"
4,Groovy,"I have alot of fun with this album. I love to listen to it while driving. She has come up with a unique combination of crunchy guitars with her true vocal style. Avril presents a different side of pop music, with her Sk8ter Boi image, and i love it! This album has many different variations of her style. Her first single: ""Complicated"" presents a more poppy urban sound, while ""Sk8ter Boi"" and ""Losing Grip"" are harder, rockier songs. But Rock isn't all Avril is good at. Her ballad ""I'm with You"" keeps up with her Skater image, but at the same time it has a softer tone to it. My only problem with this album are her lyrics. I think that with her talent she could have come up with some deeper meanings. But thats not to say that i don't love her as it is. She has a great style and i'm going to keep this one in my cd player for a long time."
5,Avril Lavigne ( Avril Lah-Vine ),"Avril Lavigne = VocalsEvan Taubenfeld = GuitarsMatthew Brann = DrumsMark Spicoluk = BassAvril lavigne is a great Singer that grew up in a small town ( with big dreams)called Napanee, Ontario, Canida. she is an awesome Artist buy this CD it is great and deserves 10 stars!!"
1,Rounding the Bend of Sanity,"What justifies this ""artist"" getting 4 1/2 stars, average review? Its a well known fact that avril is the most foul pieces of manufactured garbage ever to be a pawn in a prefabricated album on this earth, but what would some alien think if it came and saw a 4 1/2 out of 5 star review?"
1,ICK,"This album is horrible, Avril refers to it as ""rock"" but it's really pop. Not to mentions there isn't any song on the album she wrote alone, I guess she only has enough talent to ""co-write"" all 13 songs. Not to mention, ""Complicated, Skater Boy, and i'm with you were all written by the Matrix, and although she co-wrote her latest single with less people, it's still horrible. The music avarge, the guitar playing is avarge, she's avarge. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM. You'll listen to it 3 or 4 times and then wanna throw it out your window. People think she's so cool because she's punk, but seriouly a lot of people dress like that."
2,Avril=Average,"After hearing many great things about this 'new' artist, Avril Lavigne, I figured to spend the extra 12 bucks to buy the C.D. But after listening through it, plus seeing her many ""in your face"" T.V. and magazine appearances, I was very confused by her image. One minute I'm listening to the very anti-preppy, punk rockish ""Sk8er Boi"" and the next minute I'm listening to the very popish ""I'm With You"". Sure she writes her own lyrics, and I will give her credit for that. But then when you hear a song like ""I'm With You"" and dont even know what she's singing about it becomes a bit agrivating. Though she says she's been called the ""Anti-Britney"" or the ""Punk Rock Princess"", I find this album to be very poppy and I was hardly impressed. Her voice is nothing special and her image is way off. I do not reccomend this C.D. to anyone who is a punk or rock music fan."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,"1) can u say 'boring'? most of the lyrics r dull & show no talent2) people only like her cause she looks so cool3) she doesn't have a singing voice; the music covers it upbut on the other hand...i can relate to some of her lyrics, & thats all im gonna say"
2,"Not real punk, just easy-to-hear-poprock.","Ok. Avril Lavigne IS NOT a punk rocker. She's a nü teen idol, in the same path of Britney, Christina or Natalie Imbruglia. She sings some kind of soft pop-rock music, adequate for your little sister or the part of you that will always be 13 year old and wips with ""Dawson's Creek"".I think she will be forgotten in two or three years, but you can enjoy this CD as it is: instant soup music or bubblegum rock. If you want real punk rock (Ramones, Sex Pistols, Rancid, the-local-guys-who-play-in-the-funky-hole), you don't even disturb in reviewing it or telling people why they shouldn't listen to it."
3,Decent little nugget of music,"You won't get anything much from this album. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good. It's just that nothing really breaks any new ground here. If you like the songs they've played on the radio you'll dig this album. And no matter what you've heard THIS AIN'T PUNK. Then again, hardly anything is anymore. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Avril goes the same route that P!nk went and that her second album will be more along the lines of what she really wants to do. If you don't like pop music stay away from this (and what are you doing reading reviews on this album anyway?)Bottom line: Good album full of catchy tunes.If you're looking for female fronted punk check out Tsunami Bomb, Sahara Hotnight, or the mighty Devotchkas."
3,Not a bad pop album,"I was an anti-Avril for a long time due to her whole ""Im a skater thing"" but then I realized taht at least she admits that shes pop not punk. While, not an amazing album it really stands out in the rest of the sucky pop scene. If your a pop fan this will make your selection at least a liiiiiiiiiiittle better."
5,Darn Good Music,"This CD - Album is really a treat. Musically, it's one good compilation. There's only one track I have difficulty listening to (that's the first one). All the others are very, very good. It's a fresh sound. It's upbeat. It's one of those CDs that doesn't come along very often. The more I see and hear of Avril Lavigne the person (in interviews or on Saturday night live) the less I like Avril the person. However, after 2 years of listening to this CD, I still find it compelling and find myself drawn into the songs.So, in spite of Avril's odd personality, I'm very much looking forward to buying her next album that's due out on May 25th.I can't wait!"
1,Brilliant! Absolutely Brilliant!,"This album sounds nothing like Debbie Gibson or Britanny Spears. Lavigne is a true origional. Lyrics like ""Live for Beer/Smash the state/ Gutter Punks/ Oi Oi Oi etc"" will keep the punkers happy while the teeny boppers can dig on a tune like ""Not a girl Not yet a Woman""""I'm With You"" is reassuring. If I'm going to the store, she's with me. She's hot and now she's perfectly legal. She may even be nineteen. Go for it."
5,Avril Is Rockin!,"This was a very good CD. I loved all of the songs, Avril has a very powerful voice and her songs sound like they're from her heart.She is not as low as Britney, she is not punk, she has her own style and I like it. If you are ready for a very good CD then Let Go is the one for you, I love it!!!"
3,Okay CD,"I have mixed feelings about this CD. Most of the songs are really good. These include Sk8er Boi, Complicated, Anything But Ordinary, and mobile. These songs are some of the ones with great tunes, good lyrics and are just the type of song you want to listen to. A few of the songs on this CD, though, are not so great. These include Losing Grip and Unwanted. These songs are loud and are too ""rock-n-rollish"" and loud. Another down side to the CD is that on the pamphlet the lyrics are REALLY hard to read. but, if tou are a fan of Avril's like me, you should defenitely get the CD. I have had a lot of fun listening to it!"
5,GIRL POWER!!,I first her the Complicated song on TRL and right after I heard it I just had to go get the CD. I love her lyrics because they are so real and so what most teenage girls are feeling. Her voice just makes the lyrics so much more meaninful than they already are. I hope everyone buys this cd because its well worth it and your listen to it everyday.
2,Okay....but not what she is made up to be,Ya her songs are hits and she is popular and she has rave reviews..and it seems she is at the top of her game...BUT don't go see her in concert..my friend went and he was extremely disappointed unfortunately Avirl does NOT have much of a voice and can't sing at all live..She doesn't seem to care about her fans and thinks her new found stardom is all fun and gamesShe isn't as talented as I and others thought..It's too bad...
3,better than a lot today,"If I had kids, this is what I would let them listen to. She seems to have better things to do than flash her ... in nasty sweaty videos on MTV, and yeah, the whole skater thing is annoying, but hey, she's a kid. She'll grow out of it and start singing about birth control on her next album."
3,"""Complicated""..... uh-huh","This CD has some good songs...and some songs that are not so good. ""Complicated"" and ""Naked"" really get to the heart of things, but some of the other songs can bore you to death. Not only that, but the CD can be disappointing or a great excitement. Whatever the songs are named, it's not very ""complicated."""
5,Buy this CD~ Its worth it!!,"This CD is awesome!!I bought it when I heard a few songs on the radio + internet. This CD is incredibly easy to relate to. Avril is not some popstar who was found because of her looks, taught to lip synch and pretend to play guitar. She is from Napanee Ontario, a true Canadian,, with real talent. At 16 she recieved a record deal, and at 17, in only a year, she is at the top of many charts all over all of North America, as well as Europe and Asia!!This song is from a real person, who writes her own songs, so the songs are from the heart, and real experiences, not written by the record dealership.The songs are inspiring and make you want to sing along, or just listen to each story. This CD is incredibly original, and is a MUST buy!!"
4,Just what she wanted,"I bought this a Christmas Gift for my 14 year old step-daughter and she was thrilled, it was exactly what she wanted."
1,Opiate of the Masses,"How people can listen to artists like this is utterly beyond me. I don't claim to hold the answers to the universe in a little box, but I think we can do a little better than pre-packaged pop-punk trash. Avril can hide behind makeup, hooks written by others, and photo shoots for only so long. Eventually, people have to wake up and see the true movements in the world. Once there was a punk movement. It consisted of artists like The Clash and The Ramones, groups who were actually supporting a viewpoint on life, not conspiring to drain you of money.I hope someday humanity will be able to rise above this fake pop culture. What happened to artistic value? I'm scared of the implications of artists like this making it big. Very scared."
1,This is not punk!,"If you want punk, look somewhere else. Punk Avril is not. Pop she is. More poppy than punk. Complicated is good though but it's not punk."
1,How do people like this get record contracts???,"I'll make this review short and simple. This cd contains some the worst music ever. I'd rather listen to John Travolta or ""Disco Duck"" than this. ""Complicated"" is one of those songs you would hear over and over again in the burning pits of hell. ""Sk8tr Boi"" is bad enough to make your ears bleed. All the other songs suck too! Avoid at all costs."
2,She goes pop !!!,"This punk album is fair. She screams a lot, so I didn't give her 4 stars. I think it's missing some guitar solos. Excuse me ! But here are even TWO guitarists, and they don't really know how to play guitar !!! If the guitarists would play any guitar solos, this would be perfect. And what I also don't like, are the drums. Here are some techno drums. And this isn't really punk rock. She goes pop in this album. And here is only one punky song. It's SK8ER BOI. I can't hear here a lot of bass. It's missing some bass. I was very dissapointed of this CD. It could be better. I DON'T recommend to buy this album."
1,um,Why do people like Avril? Shes just another Teenie Bop Idol. I hate her! I'd rather listen to classiscal music than this stupid 'teen' stuff. She thinks she punk even though shes just some dam Canadian!
2,C'mon people!,"Ok, at first, I really liked her. She was a new voice for a new generation, she's so Anti-Britney, which made everyone love her. But after a while, things get old. About 4 or 5 times a day I hear this on the radio ""Uh huh....life's like this...uh huh uh huh that's the way it is"" Do you know how annoying that is? And the same with Sk8er Boi. And then there's the thing about how she always wears ties and dresses like a guy. What is she, a hermaphrodite? Would it kill her to not wear a tie? I mean seriously. It's like how Alicia Keys always wore her hair in braids, it gets old, and drives me crazy, but I actually like Alicia Keys. I think Avril needs a break. I mean, I'm just so sick of her. She should back off and let other people who talent sing. There are talented people out there who are hardly ever heard. Like Kay Hanley or Nina Gordon. But, who am I to say anything"
4,Yay for Avril,"4 Stars for Canadian new-comer Avril LaVigne. At only 17, she has created a spectacular and soulful album. The joy in it is that she wrote all of the songs on this album, although she does not know how to read music. ""Let Go"" has a diversity of musically appreciated tracks, including the teeny-bopper pop hit ""Skater Boy"" (which is to be the follow-up single to ""Complicated""), a track that reaks of Pink's ""love me for me"" theory ""Losing Grip"" and the happy and easy to listen songs including ""Things I'll Never Say"" and ""My World"". Avril has certainly created a name for herself in Canadian, American, and international stardom. The album is amazing, and it is about time that the World was struck with another amazing act from Canada. 4 Stars!"
2,Another record company shoving it on to mainstream.,"yea well avril, u don't wanna sound like britney spears but, to me you sound like britney spears. with guitars. the lyrics are even worse than ones i can write by myself. I think this cd is a waste of time and hard earned money."
1,The horror!!,"It's unbelievable people would give this pathetic excuse for an album more than 1 star.It's like Hilary Duff, except the singer in question is even more annoying (which surprised me)."
2,Bleh! Punk tries to go pop,"You know, I'll be completely serious. If you listen to the likes of Britney Spears or any other of those fabricated pop stars, chances are, this will soon be your favorite C.D. But if you listen and the next day you go to school, you're wearing leather spikey thingys and claiming to be punk when just the day before, you were walking around in an abercrombie and fitch shirt and LEI jeans, you just got the wrong idea. AVRIL LAVIGNE IS NOT A PUNK AND WILL NEVER BE A PUNK! She is just a regular pre-fab pop star. The only diffrence is that instead of looking like a whore and singing to dance music, she dresses ""punk"" and has some band behind her. So look, I'm not saying don't buy the C.D., I'm just saying don't take her the wrong way."
4,Not Bad,"My friend had this album on his computer and I decided to give it a listen and I must say its a pretty good album. Im not into much of todays music but Avril has an infectious voice and the melodies on the some of the songs were fabulous. I don't understand these people that say she cannot sing, she sounds like an Angel."
5,Avril Rocks!,"Loved the album..Avril is a very talented artist! If you loved this album you'll love Kelly Osbourne ""Changes"" CD. Both are great albums! Avril's ""Let Go"" Rocks!"
1,I wish I could give this 0 stars...,"I used to be a fan of Avril when I was younger. Now I'm 13 and I relize how FAKE she is! She CAN'T sing. I heard her live on TV once, and her voice is so horrible, the band is louder than Avril's voice! The songs are really bad, lyrics are horrible, and now I won't even listen to the CD anymore. Take my advice: Avoid this CD and Avril Lavigne's garbage. If you want to listen to a female singer who can sing with a gorgeous voice, plays guitar beautifully, writes her own songs, and has wonderful lyrics, I recommend the album ""Pieces of You"", by my favorite singer, Jewel."
1,Forget about Avril,Don't be fooled by what she says about herself - that she is punk or rock or whatever. She pretends to be something more than Britney or Christina but she is in fact much worse than them. Her songs are dull and pure pop - sweet and pink like Britney's ones. If you want punk or rock music - there are plenty of real artists that can offer you real music. Forget about Avril! Don't waste your money on this album - it's just not worthy
2,A more nieve Morissette...,"Avril Lavigne burst onto the pop scene with ""Complicated"" and the lyrics are written herself. No wonder! I qam not bashing her, I am trying to say she is immature. She has the angst of Alanis Morissette's ""Jagged Little Pill"" but nowhere near the talent Morissette has. Although young, she has mucvh to learn. She may have lots to say, however, she needs to taget a more alternative listening group rather than teenie-boppers who wants to be ""punk rockers"". She refuses the teen pop title, and insists she is alternative style. Lavigne needs to grow up, and so does her music."
5,Definatly not an Unwanted album,"Dude kids, this CD kids buttox, and if you don't get it I will be angered. Its a total blend of mad rock in ""Losing Grip"" and ""Unwanted"" and cute punky songs like ""Sk8r Boi"" then ballads that are kinda countryish with that rock twist like the song ""I'm with you"". What got me going on this punksta was the song ""Complicated"". I was leaving school, driving my car when the song came on and I was like ""hey, I dig this!"" then the line ""Take off all your preppy clothes"" totally got me cause then I knew... she was a punksta. Next time the song came on I freaked out and totally listend to the lyrics. Kids, the song is about being yourself and not being what people in the situation your in want you to be, cause someone will catch you and think you look like a foo, and write a song about it and get famous off of it and you don't want dat do ya? nu-uh"
2,It's... well not the best in the world,"I think this is something that females like more than males, the collection of catchy tunes and softer songs, doesn't really appeal to us that much, but i can say it gets at least 2 stars, which isn't saying it's bad, i just don't plan on giving 5 stars to an album unless i believe it's going to be around and stick from now on (ignore any previous 5 star reviews that was me going a bit overboard)... lol she's still worth a listen as is all music... you don't know if you like it until you hear it more than once i do believe... :D"
1,Jeremy Snyder and all Haters...,"You're great!! You say all the truth about this girl. That girl has bring up my friends like she wants to be (or pretend), the ""copy"" Avril (tie included...PUAGH!), and that's annoying, 'coz when the people looks al me they say: ""WOW YOU HAVE A LOOK ALIKE WITH AVRIL!!!"" I hate it 'cause I'm really a sk8er - guitar player - punk girl and I'm very angry with the comercial music like hers... I have only one thing to say...It sucks! 'Cause I have written 22 songs and I'm going to realize my dream...to be a REAL good guitar player and singer, and not like the singers that appears since 6 years ago, Jeremy and all haters...WILL CONTACT YOU? Hey there and... ROCK ON GUYS!"
4,Avril Rox!,"Hello everyone,first of all i will like to rule out that Miss Lavigne NEVER,EVER claim herself to be PUNK!Just because she's a newcomer with more rocking edgy style and those amazing ""rare attitude"",people misguided her type of music.She's in fact pop+rock+alternative and a little of country singer.Yes,she does has precocious talent,where she could sings,writes and plays the guitar.Thanks to her dynamic vocals and different voice range capablities that we have ""Let Go"", a quintaple platinum status album and a handful grammy nominations which has already sold over 10 millions of copies worldwide.And believe me,as avril grows,her song writing skills are soon to be improved on a more mature side.She sets the example of a great teen icon for kids,unlike britney at the age of 19,but singing ""Boys"" and ""I'm a Slave for You"".With her memorable voice,we'll probably be witnessing a fine country singer in making......."
3,"good for pop, but avril's just a poser","avril's music isn't that bad, but avril herself is the most annoying POP star not rock star, not punk rocker (well maybe punk rock waannabe) but POP star, existing. her oh i'm so punk airs are ridiculus. the music itself, except for complicated and sk8er boi ( i haven't seen a 18 yr old write like that for a while) is ok. losing grip and unwanted are someut heavy songs ( as far as pop goes) that have some sort of musical quality, too much to ask and naked are almost as good as a vanessa carleton type song, anything but ordinary has a good tune but the lyrics are wut could be called 'poser lyrics'. nobodys fool has a good message but wuts with avril rapping? tomorrow is actually the kind of song i like. its not rock or anything but its somewut touching.too bad she didn't write all these songs.oh and she doesn't play the guitar. its just a commercial act."
2,what can I say?,"I heard ""Complicated"" and liked it, so I bought the CD. That was a foolish move - I like a total of 2 songs on the whole album. ""Complicated"" and ""Unwanted"". I don't get why people say that ""Sk8r Boi"" is the most punk(est?) song on the album, it's something totally opposite of what I think of as punk. I could have easily burned those 2 songs from one of my friend's cds. I never listen to ""Let Go"" anymore. It's collecting dust on my shelf. I could have used my money to buy the new Christina Aguilera cd (which I eventually did) instead. (I bought ""Let Go"" in September 2002.) I wouldn't recommend spending money on this."
1,. . . . .,"1st of all, i would like 2 say that JERRY SYNDER, i totally agree with you, AVRIL IS A FAKE. She cant play guitar, she doesnt write half of da songs, tht she states she wrotes all by herself. and finally, WHY DOES SHE DREES LIKE A PUNK??? I mean seriously, she is POP people, not anytype if rock. And why did they play at metallica's MTv icon show??? That was a disgrace to metallica, even kirk and the lead singer said they dont know why avril played at their show.But realize this; Avril sux. . .i cant see how u can like her songs. I dont hate ""her"" type of music, but she sucks at it.My friend has this cd, and it sux. And i did giv avril a chance, but she just cant be what she wants 2 be, a rock star(gwen stefani, da gurl from da distillers). Speakin of gwen, now theres a rock band, with a gurl singer. And gwen doesnt take credit 4 all da success of her band, and she just be's herself, not no wanna-be punker."
1,Weve seen it all before...,"Seriously, I don't know what all this ""Avril"" fuss is about. She says she doesn't want to be anything but ordinary, but she really is ordinary. Just another story of another ""rock star"" that will probably be long forgotten in a few years. Her music is nothing new. Completely typical for a ""punk rocker"" and to me, she is a complete poser. Sorry Avril, But your no differant than anyone else."
2,The Horror....Of Pop Music,"Okay, this is pop. It's pop with one track that she RAPS(ugh) on and one track that sounds okay, just because it's so dark. I got a kick out of reading the reviews for this CD. Blah,blah,blah..She needs to figure herself out....Blah,blah,blah...She's not a songwriter....Blah,blah,blahAnd all I can think is ..SHUT UP!She has a right to still be figuring herself out. She's,what,18? At least she even trys to write her own music, unlike Britney Spears who has some guy named Max write for her. I myself am a songwriter and sometimes it is frustrating, although I personally refuse help. After all, I write about MY life not some guy named Max's right? You know what I think? I think Avril is just a girl who wanted to rock out, but was shoved in a pop direction and instead of sacrificing her record deal, she sacrificed her need to rock out. Would you have refused to sing pop even if you would lose a record deal for it? Just ask yourself that question and think."
1,AvRiL lAvIgNe RaWks!!!!,"This album is sped up bubble gum pop at it's worst. I listened to this cd expecting to listen to some good pop rock but was dissapointed when all I heard were songs that could have made some singles for Britney Spears if they were slightly toned down. The song ""Unwanted"" is especially laughable. You can hear her trying to sing with an edge and fail miserably. The lyrics are so inane (when Lavigne sings ""take of your preppy clothes,"" is she talking to herself? Even Aaron Carter and the Backstreet Boys dress more like ""rock stars"" though in no way I am implying they are. Another annoyance is the credits for the songs. Lavigne keeps saying she wrote the songs but in the credits it says they're co-wtitten by her and professional song writers. Even Nsync does that. I would give Let Go zero stars but unfortunately amazon doesn't have that option."
4,You can listen to it straight through,"I can't stand Avril's attitude but she definitely made a hit with this album. Ironically, this CD and it's songs seem to represent everything Avril claims to hate.Compiled of pop hits, this cd is a pleasure to listen to because you don't have to skip any of the songs. The lyrics are simple, but catchy, and there isn't too much of one instrument to drown out the others. Most of the songs sound the same but it's still enjoyable if you like her style.I would recommend it to anyone who likes mainstream music."
2,Only one good song,"This was such a disappointing album. The only song I liked was the hit ""Complicated."" The rest of it sounded like everything else you hear. Just generic and boring. My husband and I listened all the way through and as soon as it was done we both laughed and said - sell it!"
5,Incredible!!!,"When I heard the first single ""complicated"" from her album ""let go"" I was completley blown away by her deeply fullfilled voice.In my openion she is way better than michelle branch and all those other teen singers in terms of vocals and actaul talent.This cd has some really good songs like ""Im with you"" and ""Things i''ll never say"" along with some others.All you pop and alternative fans should defenitly pick this one up as soon as possible!"
1,THIS IS NOT PUNK,"lets take this slowley okay. first THIS: meaning this cd and avril. second, IS: state of being. 3rdly NOT: SIMPLY NOT having nothing to do with in any way. Lastly PUNK: punk, okay this is not punk, go look at punk in the punk section in your music store, this is not punk no way at all. I wouldn't mind it, if she classified herself as what she is, rock/pop. There i said it. I do not recomend this cd if you are under the impression that this is punk."
2,sry...avrils not punk,"When I first heard skater boy, I thought ""this is a cool pop song"". Then people were like ""oh avril is so punk"". No way! She cant play the guitar well, she thinks that she is a punk,when in reality she doesnt know a thing about it! And before she even became famous, she was a prep. She just wanted people to think she was unique and cool. She cant write a decent song. So, I suggest not buying this cd because it has like two good songs on it, which you could easily download. Dont waste your money on this cd, you will regret it."
5,Avril Lavigne!..,"What I like about her is that she's her own person and not another Britney or Christina wannabe! Ever since this CD came out, I've been soo addicted to her and her music! It's just kickass, in your face good rock music!"
2,her persona spoiled the music for me,"i'm not going to lie. she comes off as this punky chick, but once she opens her mouth i just want to smack her. this album promises but does not deliver. with what she says her influences are, you'd expect something hard, of the ramones at the most, of green day/blink 182 at the least. but this album has NOTHING to do with anything she is supposed to represent. it is not a punk album, it is not what her character portrays. it is exactly what she always speaks out against, pure pure pop with a tad bit mix of country in it. there is no quality in this album, it is another teeny bopper piece of crap. too much whining. i feel sorry i borrowed this album. my advice, preview it online, the static from the poor streaming does the songs more justice. why 2 stars? it is poppy and catchy, that's all."
5,Avril Lavigne ( Lah-Vine ),"Avril Lavigne - Vocals- Evan Taubenfeld -Guitars-Matthew Brann -Drums-Marck Spicoluk - Bass.Avril Lavigne is Gifted with a mature voice at the young age of 17, she tough herself to play guitar. Her music is a mix of pop rock and soft punk rock some might compare to Alanis Morisette. She write the lyric to her songs about her feelings. She is very Original and I would recommend this CD to those sick of Britney Spears."
1,Don't play this on your PC,"This is a great CD, but don't buy it to play on your PC.It sounds awful on a PC. This disc has been doctored so that it plays differently in your PC than from your hi-fi CD player. You might just as well listen to it on a mobile phone.Poor Avril - she's been conned."
4,Huh?,"Okay, I have to say that Avril Lavigne has a lot of talent and her song Complicated is one of my favorites and I've heard it on the radio a lot and I love it.However, Im kind of confused. I've listened to some songs on AOL in concert and I've listened to the ones on her CD. For some reason her voice on the CD is rather high but her real voice is deep. So Im confused, is she a Hilary Duff who relies on computer effects or is it something else like the mic she sings to or is it that her voice changed?"
2,"Avril, you are too old to be doing this.","I have listened to this CD all the way through and it is not that special. Hiccupy, unattractive girl voice with tiresome, bland acoustic guitars, screeching about how much life sucks.Now, not all the songs are horrible, but they could be more mature. If Avril got some singing lessons and changed her image, I just might like her a little more. But I'm sorry if I hurt other people's feelings, but she is WAY too old for that punk look. I wonder what she dresses like in real life. But come on she is twenty something years old and she is dressing like girls in my 6th grade class. Just drop the act, Avril. I'm not falling for the little charade."
2,Trying too hard,"Okay. Maybe she has a mediocre voice, and some singing talent, but she is trying too hard to be something she's not. After all of her songs that were aired on TV, not ONE of them was actually punk, which is what she claims to be. I say, stick to what your good at, and don't TRY to be someone you're not."
2,All Image!,"She's Hot! So I'll give her 2 stars for that, but voice wise, no way. Heard her on Leno and she has no voice at all. Sure she might sound all cute and looks good in a tight t-shirt, but she cannot sing. Most of the stuff you hear on the cd has been edited extensively in the ""magic"" box to make her sound all that great *cough* Britney Spears *cough*. And no way is this girl even close to punk or even alternative.If you like POP music, then you might like this cd, but if you want real punk music, try goldfinger or nofx, that will show you what real punk is all about.Shortly put it: ""Awesome chick, bad artist."""
1,One Of The best Punk Albums Of All Time?,"Firstly Avril Lavigne has done a great job, lets face it, anyone who can do something completely un-natural to themselves, and earn millions is a genius.I understand she was a country and western singer before her producer told her, 'look the best way to earn millions is to become a completely fake bimbo with the wrong label, but the right audience', or something like that anyway, then she replied, 'no, I love my country singing, please, please,' then, 'Enough! You shall be a punk rock star who sings about skater boys, OK?', 'I suppose so,' I'm not sure if thats 100% accurate, but I heard it through the 'punk rock' grapevine. So, here we are, with yet another talentless person making WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.I swear I met her once in a moshpit at a Tool concert, oh no, maybe in a barn somewhere with her acoustic guitar, much more probable."
5,Avril's got talent for those who are blinded by the light,"First of all for those people who did not even HEAR the cd, dont write a review because you wouldn't know. Avril has talent and she doesn't call herself ""punk"" or her music ""punk rock"". Most people are just sterotypes. She just speaks her mind. I enjoy most of her songs. Do not miss out on:1. Losing Grip2. Complicated3. Sk8er Boi4. I'm With You5. Mobile6. Unwanted7. Tomorrow8. Anything but Ordinary9. Things I'll Never Say10. My World11. Nobody's FoolThose are in my opinion the best out of 13."
2,Ordinary and pretentious,"Avril brings to my mind the following words by Wolfgang A. Mozart: ""The golden meam, the truth, is no longer recognized or valued. To win applause one must write stuff so simple that a coachman might sing it, or so incomprehensible that it pleases simply because no sensible man can comprehend it"". As a great professor (Neuhaus?) once wrote, ""Talent is passion plus intellect"". You are cool, Avril, but how about a little visit to the Conservatory before even attempting to write your own music? Oh, I see, you are too cool to lose your time at school!"
3,Pretty good,"I bought this CD having heard a few of the songs and found myself enjoying those songs. After listening to the entire CD I found a couple of songs that I hadn't already heard to be good. But, the rest were merely ok, if that."
3,Pretty talented,"I absolutely despie the song ""Ska8er Boi"". It's soo annoying and gets stuck in your head. But, I heard her other song ""Losing Grip"" on MTV the other day and was kinda interested, D/L a few songs from Kazaa and went and bought the cd. I think ""Complicated"" is an okay song, really like ""I'm With You"" and the rest of the cd is good too. Her voice sounds different in every song and ya gotta admit she does have some vocal talent. The lyrics are pretty good too. I really like the song ""Tomorrow"". Overall, I would say it's a good cd, but would be better w/o ""Ska8er Boi""!"
2,Avril Killed Punk,"Punk is dead because of Avril Lavigne. She sings songs that sound nothing like punk and now the MTV viewers think punk rock is ""Sk8ter Boy"". She calls herself the anti britney but she is Britney only I give Britney more respect because she doesn't think she a punk. The songs are pretty good but not punk. If you want to hear real punk try the sex pistols of ramones not avril."
1,Well we have to give it one star...,"Has anyone else out here wondered why there are 10 different versions of this cd? Do we know of anyone else that puts out that many versions of an album to make money? This is just another stereo-typical pop-punk record designed to sink your wallet in the toilet. The songs are uninspired and horrible. But, you can't blame Avril...seeing as how she wrote little to none of the music on here. I would even choose Blink-182 over here even with as bad as they suck. Don't waste your money on this cd...it is THAT bad."
1,add water ...,"Equation for success in the music business:1. Identify age demographic of intended sales2. Hire image consultant to identify current styles and trends3. Write singles by committee, two-thirds majority rules on singles to add to album4. Book appearances on as many M-Tv sponsored events and tours as possible.5. Hold walk-on auditions and make-up tests for possible artist(s).6. After said artist is hired, add water daily7. Reap in success until album falls to below 75 on the top 100.8. Repeat"
4,an honest review.,"i am a big fan of Avril Lavigne, but when I look back at old pictures of her I think to myself, 'what a poseur'. Its true, despite how many times other fans like me come to her defense whenever someone says she's a poseur, I agree with whoever that person was. She was stretching the rock chick image a bit too far. I'm not saying she claimed she was a punk, but I'm saying she was trying to be someone she couldn't. But she pulled it off incredibly in her second album (another story).But still, this album is wonderfull, all acoustic guitar-drums feel-ey easy pop punk. The whole album is basically a lot of fun, Avril teases and shouts a lot on this album, but it doesn't get annoying once, that is, accounting ONLY to the songs on this album.I liked it, but its definitely not for intolerant people who already have a very bad image of Avril.B+"
4,A great debut for an emerging artist,"Though Sk8er Boi gets the most radio airtime, it may well be the weakest selection on the CD. Avril's true style, I think, comes out much better in other songs. People who buy the CD for Sk8er Boi will be disappointed, but there's no reason to be disappointed by this CD at all. If you give the other songs a chance, you'll see that they are much better than some people give them credit for. Avril's a talented musician, and I hope to hear more from her in the future."
4,A very good Pop-Rock album!,"What really makes this album extra-ordinary from all the other Pop-Rock albums I've listened to is the first track. I've had this theory that the first track of an album tells the listener whether they'll like the rest of it or not. It mostly is a melodic up-tempo song with a catchy chorus and a beat that makes you want to dance. But this time it's different. ""Losing Grip"", the first track, is a rather depressive song, yet powerful. As for the whole album, it's really sometimes Pop and sometimes Rock, but it's definitely not Punk. You could call ""Sk8er Boi"" Pop-Punk, but that's all. The good thing is that all of the songs seem to tell a different story and that shows Avril's talent as a song-writer. I like each song off the album, but my favorite song is ""I'm With You"" which reveals Avril's great voice. I wouldn't compare her to any artist, she's just Avril Lavigne, that's never been there before. It's the best album I've heard for months."
2,A disappointed punk rock chick,If your looking for punk rock when you buy Avril's cd. You'll be sorry that you bought the cd. The songs are mostly pop. The music is like Alanis Morrisette. But avril's lyrics aren't as deep. Some songs are really lame.
3,Go Avril !,"I read she's no Britney Spears- WELL THANK GOD FOR THAT !!! Avril Levigne is probably more mature now at sixteen than Britney ever will be. Since when does being a mega-superstar qualify you to be so great anyway? Talk about OVERHYPE! Just look at all the knuckle-heads walking around with a ton of money and too much time on their hands, trouble following them around where-ever they go. ANYWAY, for a first album I thought LET GO is quite good, especially for a first effort. To me, a 3-star rating is GOOD, with not very many CD's rating 4-5 stars which would be very good and exceptional. I think Avril will make a mark for her-self and she won't have to be an over-rated ""superstar"" to do it. GO,AVRIL,GO!!"
5,Refreshing!,"I like every song on this album. It's kinda like Pop music which I don't really care for that much, except it has a little more of a rockin' sound to it. Avril shows a wide range with her voice and her music."
3,"Avril, Great, Good, and Horrible in one album","the first time i listened to this album, is sounded great, but then i listened to it 30 more times, the album has some flaws and a few errors, the singing sounds like it was recorded all in one take, except for I'm With You, that was a good track, songs like Unwanted and Nobodys Fool sound like songs to keep the album above 40 minutes, the rapping made my ears bleed, it was horrible, but now too her talents, she is a great writer very mature lyrics for her age, 17 at the time. A so-so guitar player, not all her talent went into it in the album, even though she only plays for a couple songs, the guitar and bass seemed lacking in a couple ways. Skater Boi was a mediocre song, maybe because it was played way too many times. But she is talented, and does show a lot of heart into was she does, and that's basically all that counts."
3,Mediocre Pop For Young Girls,"Avril Lavigne may have a ""punk"" image, what with her sideways baseball caps and baggy pants...but let's face it, the girl's music is not rock. It is, however, standard pop fare driven by guitars to make it sound more edgy- perfect for young girls searching to find music ""cooler"" than Britney's but who are not ready to make the leap into listening to real rock bands. That said, Lavigne's record does have two catchy songs, ""Complicated"" and ""Skater Boi,"" and she does deliver a convincing vocal performance on ""I'm With You,"" but the rest of the tunes are rather forgettable."
1,0 stars,"This is the most worst junk ever. You might like this only if you like Good Charlotte. Avril thinks she has the whole punk theme down but what she doesn't realize is that her music to pure bubblegum pop. I mean really, if you listen to Britney's ""I'm not a girl, not yet a woman"" and Hilary's ""So-Yesterday"" there wouldn't be a difference in the world between ALL of Avril's songs. Her CD is basically very boring, you could probably only listen to a few songs then get bored and switch to another CD! Don't let the media fool you like they did with Good Charlotte. Don't think just because Avril likes to smash expensive guitars that her music is punk because it's not anywhere near! If you're looking for something to bang your head to this would not be the CD! If you're looking for something country/pop like Shania Twain or something...this is the CD for you. Which may I add that Shania Twain was Avril's influence....and she said she was the next Sid Vicious....ha!"
1,good god i ummmm,"Avril has got to be the most poser-iest person ive heard of, and i know she would be classified as pop (though she probably thinks she is death metal or *gasp* punk),but she cant even do the pop thing right. she needs to learn how to sing, have good music/lyrics to go along with it and stop bein' such a freakin' jerk...maybe i could sleep better if i covered this cd with bleach and acid....or use it as a defense weapon that i could throw at sad avril loving souls and hit them in the jugular with{i know poser-iest isnt a word}"
4,whu?,"i love punk. avrils music isnt what ive seen in punk and certainly nothing like old school but thats just in the music, back when i was younger it was people raggin on green day.for the most part my cd players got in it dropkick murphys, the smiths, dead kennedys, sex pistols, the clash, the pixies and the ramones but whats so wrong with this girl. i dont get it. my ex went off about her, just about everyone ive come in contact withs had a problem with her, granted her type of music isnt what i listen to be i like her music. she seems to get really into her songs and i like listening to it.its always been, whats punk, whats not. its all ive heard through my life from people and they call her a poser. whos anybody to judge her on that. do they know her, no they dont. people think too much on it."
1,She Should Have Quit While She Was Ahead,"That is all I have to say about Avril. Her career is obviously at death's door, even though she never deserved any fame whatsoever. That is the only good thing about her, which is really quite sad. But really, is it possible for her upcoming album to match the insane success of ""Let Go""? Avril's target audience is growing up, one day they will be embarassed to say they were once a fan of hers. One thing does scare me though: when Avril's career has ended, who will be taking her place? That really is a scary thought. If you like this album, I'd suggest listening to some other, better artists, and you will forget this little notalent ever existed (even that new Courtney Love album is better than this!). And for those of you who have never heard Avril (probably few), steer clear of this atrocity!"
3,"avril,whats up",i expected alot more from avril her voice is good and some songs are fine but wow she dresses like a boy
2,It couldbe so mutch better,"OK, I will admit their are a few songs that are good but the most of it is just her singing about what every other pop singer before her sang about. No real issues just a boy this and I can't do that. She has possibility and determination but she needs to find her voice and start singing about real issues."
4,not bad at all...,"My 10-year-old loves her, and I can actually listen to these songs and enjoy them!"
4,A Good First Album,"""Let Go"" is Avril Lavigne's debut album. (She was only about 18 years old at the time). I would have to classify this as a rock album as opposed to punk rock (though there are touches of pop and metal).Avril Lavigne's style is very casual and catchy, and most of these tracks are good, straight-forward, easy-to-sing-along-with songs. The album features what is by far Avril Lavigne's most famous song, ""Complicated,"" as well as the other singles ""Sk8er Boi,"" ""I'm With You,"" and ""Losing Grip."" As a whole, it is a very listenable album with a nice variety of musical flavor. I think that anyone who likes casual rock or pop rock music, especially young ladies, will probably like it."
1,gayness,"hey yeah u guys avril is really cool! to those who dont care what is happening to the ""punk"" name: okay, maybe ppl should lay off imposers but only if she would let ppl come up with their own impression. she keeps telling ppl who she is and how she is so punk and hardcore. if she truely was a punk, would she need to tell ppl that? who is there to convince if she really is. and i am sure a true punk wouldnt even bother to label themselves. wow this cd really sucks and even if she wasnt such a poser, her songs are lame and pop sucks!"
5,Why buy Avril? Because your kids love her.,"I bought ""Let's go"" for my then-6-year-old because even though I thought Sk8r boi (or whatever) was completely vapid, both my kids knew all of the words. Avril is not punk. Avril is not deep. Avril does not have an enormous vocal range. Avril lacks stage presence (yes, we went to the concert--my partner, me, and three kids under eight; give us a medal). What Avril has is an ability to sing songs that kids get, that they can sing along to, and that will, over time, help them to understand that life sometimes sucks and sometimes doesn't. If she sounds like Pink and Alanis, so much the better. We have their albums too."
1,Whiny Brat in Daddy's Clothes,"This girl does not sound punk at all! She's just a whiny brat in her daddy's clothes. If you want real punk or something like it, Courtney Love will serve just fine. She does not have a hard edge to her voice at all. She sounds like an Alanis Morrisette clone. She whines incessantly in Losing Grip and I'm With You. Then she pretends that she's tough stuff while singing in a little girl voice in Skater Boi and Complicated. There is no edge to her voice at all. She is a total phony. This is not punk. It's the punk fm lite."
4,"Good, but not yet excellent","The product is good, but in my opinion it could be more stylish. Besides when it is charging, the charging light in my Ipaq does not turn on which is worrying, sometimes I dont know if it is charging. In the end, it performs well, but I think the product can be better and as I said, more stylish."
4,Excellent resource,"This resource is marvelous and I only find one mistake in the whole volume (not that I am an expert on the other areas). In the infant feeding it is suggested that 3 months old is the age to start solid foods, but in fact solids should not be started before the age of 6 months old."
5,very informative,"When i first got this book,ijust couldn't stop reading. It has help me with my son with colitis. I am giving him alot more natural remedies because of this book. He has being doing great thank to the lord."
5,Lifesaving,This is a book everyone should have in their home. It gives you all sorts of info on any and every health issue. Very well written and very informative.
2,Flawed,"I'm currently trying to make my way through this book. I find material of value here, but its poorly organized. Another problem is that I regularly find myself disagreeing with the author. Example: The author presents the premise of the film ""Unforgiven"" as being, in a nutshell, ""Violence, no matter how justified, is always irrational."" If you have seen this film, I think you would conclude that a more likely premise is this: Violence, once initiated, is impossible to control. It spreads and often comes rebounding back beyound our power to contain its fury."
5,Best of the Bunch!,"This is simply the best screenwriting book I've read, and I've read them all. I am not a professional. I am a graduate student studying history, but I have always aspired to writing for the screen. If you want to read about style and format, this book is not what you are looking for. However, if you want to read about theme, premise, structure, character development and other important facets of screenwriting this book is right up your ally. After reading this book my passion for screenwriting was reinvigorated and am now finishing up my first script. I hope everyone finds this book as helpful as I did."
2,Nothing special,I don't know what the hype is. Tis book is pretty basic and full of knowledge most writers already know.
3,Good enough but the metal is poor quality,"I purchased this product to add to my tool set. I have found myself needing an item like this every so often. UPS delivered the product about 10 minutes ago and when I opened it I found that the ruler part is quite rusted. There are 4 or 5 spots of rust, some greater then 1/2"" on the ruler. While this will not impact the general usability, for a new product to be rusted when you get it, means it's just going to get worse over time."
2,Would not buy this flavor again.,"Well, we love the Spiru-tein products.However, the cookie dough is not nearly as good as it sounds.The big downfall, in my humble opinion, is the texture.If I want a protein shake, I really don't want chunky thingssitting on my tongue. It made me feel like I had to chew my shake!I just want the FLAVOR of cookie dough, not chunks of UFs (Unidentified Foods).I have included photos of the packet back so folks can see the vitamin content.That part is great, but I couldn't get this one down.Spiru-tein missed the boat on this one. It could have been one of thebest ones out there, but instead, it is just a bad texture andso-so taste. Back to the lab, please!"
1,"Cool watch, doesn't work","I ordered this watch when it was offered as a Gold Box deal.The first watch, when I set the date and time, the time would not advance, at all. I contacted Amazon, and they promptly sent a replacement to me, and I had the replacement within two days.I set the date and time on the new watch, and the minutes would advance, but the hour does not advance."
2,"I like ""Up to our Hips"" much better","I saw the Charlatans back in '92 with Catherine Wheel opening up for them and bought all the new releases as they came out.I dragged this cd out for a listen after it gathered dust for a long while and realized why it mostly sat on the shelf--it is much weaker than their other material. The main reason I gave it a spin recently was all the rave reviews I read on the Net and had to have another listen in case I missed something. Nope, can't get into it."
3,"Nature Mist Three Function 6"" Handheld Shower","This is a descent shower head, but the hose will burst inside the metal jacket rendering it useless.. it happened twice for us and we have low water pressure. On a possitive note Nature Mist (LDR) was good about replacement. Note: this unit is discontinued."
2,Combination of Strange Ideas and Helpful Information,"While this book provides some nformation, it also makes some strange statements. Among other things, the book states that 1.Fours years olds should watch TV. 2. While it's ok for kids to be interested in letters and numbers, you should keep the information to yourself and not tell family or friends about it. 3.Kid's mental and physical abilities are determined in large part by their body shape. 4.It's better for kids to go to day care than to spend time with their parents. I didn't find this book to be particularly useful."
4,Your Four-Year Old: Wild and Wonderful,"This series of books is excellent. Each chronological year of child development is covered succinctly and in such a way that regardless of the educational level, it is understandable. The authors are quick to point out, that although developmental stages occur around a certain chronological age, your child is an individual and therefore, may not always fit neatly into the guidelines presented. However, it does give the stressed parent, a guideline of ""normalcy"" and practical tips to deal with difficult behaviors."
1,"outdated, outmoded","This book is outdated in its viewpoints, and probably in its advice as well. All references are to ""the mother"" (and many observations re: moms are negative). The ""toileting"" section was especially scary. Unless/until this can be updated (a la the Spock book), I'd avoid it."
4,A Great Look at the Four-Year Old's Personality,"I love these line of books by Frances L. Ilg. This book is worth it just for the advice on what sort of birthday party to throw for your child. The birthday party recommendation section is definitely my favorite. She explains exactly the sort of party a child this age can manage. I've bought this book every year before my child's respective birthday, and each party I've planned according to this book has been a great success.These books pretty much take you through the personality of your child by telling you how a typical child this age acts. She's pretty accurate in her assessments, and it's a great guide on how to react to different situations. It also takes away the worry about your child's many mood changes."
5,A Love Letter to Alaska,"Since I am interested in going to Alaska for a vacation, I wanted to read something informative written by a resident. Leslie Fields did just that. In fact, I would love to stop by and see her when I go. This was truly a memoir and not just a bio. She very honestly and affectionately tells her story while leaving a written legacy for her children. I usually read fast, but I took this book on a Caribbean cruise this winter and took the whole two weeks to read it. It was an intereting contrast to where I was at the time. I particularly enjoyed hearing an insider's view of the Valdez oil spill. A very good book!"
5,Excellent read,"I just returned from a trip to Alaska - 4th trip to Alaska, first trip to Larsen Bay on Kodiak, AK. The first day that my husband and I were out on a fishing trip with our guides from Kodiak Island Resort we passed the islands were the Fields have their homes where they live when they fish. Our boat captain pointed these out and commented about the family working together on the setnets. A day later we happened to go to the cannery to get the weight on a large fish I caught. At the cannery store I bought Surviving the Island of Grace and could barely put it down after I started it. Leslie is an excellent writer. She wove the story of how she grew up into how it prepared her for the life she made with her husband on Harvester Island. I am actually on Amazon tonight looking for something else by her to read."
3,"Well, drats!","I was so hoping this was the resurgence of this great group. But, this CD was a real disappointment. All the songs seem to have the same ""sound"" and nothing really stands out. The other albums always offered such a great combination of love ballards to rock. But, there was nothing special about this one. At one time, I paid $500 to sit in the 2nd row at their concert. Can't say I would do that if any of these songs were going to be sung. Sorry guys...maybe you're never gone...but I am!"
1,BSB SUCKS!,"I have not listened to this album yet, but I don't like these guys anyway. I think that they SUCK! I must say that System of a Down, Green Day, and Slipknot are ten times better than these guys. This album shouldn't be called "" Never Gone"", it should be called, "" Better off Gone"". One more thing, your not a band unless you play an instrument!"
1,so now they're rockers eh?,I can't stand pop artists who try to be rock and call themselve punk. The backstreet boys and this horrible effort is no different from a hilary duff record
1,Backstreet Boys should be gone for good,"There's no doubt, this album is trash. Two reasons why? the first reason is that there music is getting old. There songs are so bad, they shouldn't even be played on the radio. they might have been great int the 1990's, but..................................NEWSFLASH!!!! its the year 2005, when was there last album made? The second reason is our music generation right now, everyone is into the hip hop and r&b syle of music, meaning no one listens to pop, its out and its old"
4,Once again the US is caught short on tracks,"It's a good CD; but get all of the music. Go to one of the amazon internation sites to get the full version of this CD. Once again, the US record label has ""edited"" out two songs.Here is the full track listing:1.Incomplete2.Just want you know3.Crawling back to you4.Weird world5.I still...6.Poster girl7.Lose it all8.Climbing the walls9.My beautiful woman10.Safest place to hide11.Siberia12.Never gone13.Song for the unloved14.Rush over me"
5,BSB is BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this album yesterday and had it on repeat all day long, my co-worker whom does not even listen to backstreet boys started huming along after awile and said she like the album. After all this time I am happy to see that BSB has not lost a thing but added some sugar and spice!!!!!!!!!!"
3,just got it for one song lol,just got it for incomplete the rest of the cd is just filler lol not bad price though if you like back street boiys
5,Great album for all!,"It's amazing to see how the BackStreet Boys have turned into men over the passed few years. Not only have they matured physically, but their overall sound keeps getting better with every album they put out, and needless to say, Never Gone is the best to date! While they have songs that may appeal to the now older fans that have been there from the beginning of their career, they have catchy tracks that appeal to the new generation of young hearts out there. It's an album anyone can enjoy."
5,Excellent Acomplishment !!,"This by far the best cd the Backstreeet Boys have ever put out.More mature sound, shows the guys have grown with their fans.They have also made new fans with this one.Hard to pick one favorite off the album.Its rare I get a cd that I don't skip tracks on.You can't help but listen to the whole cd over and over.WELL DONE INDEED!! TRACY"
5,Never Gone,"The cd is awesome, all the songs are great and you can listen to them over and over without getting bored. I would definitely recommend buying it."
5,A Non-teen Review,"No, I'm not knocking teen fans, but some of us want to hear the opinions of other adults. And in my opinion, this is BSB's best CD yet! I work in the music industry, and for a contemporary band to make such a strong showing after a 4-5 year hiatus is phenomenal.There is not one ""cull"" in this entire CD. Every song is worth listening to over again:""Incomplete"" really grabs the heart; even if you're happily in love, the song will remind you of someone you miss. The CD is a mix of wonderful ballads and uptempo songs that will get you on your feet. Definitely a new favorite."
1,Backstreets Back... Why?,"Didn't the boy band fad die years ago? I mean come on if their so good at singing why don't they all be lead singers for rock bands. This cd I believe was made for a mixed group of people, and by that I mean little girls ages 8 to 11, The album will sell much better to people over the internet because you don't have to see the cashier laughing in your face for wasting money buying this CD."
1,THE WORLD IS ENDING,"Welcome to Part 3 of my 10-part ""Signs of the Apocalypse"" saga.PART 3The sixth sign the apocalypse is close is that the Backstreet Boys regroup, despite the fact that pop music is done and over with.The seventh sign is that they copy protect the CD so they can get even more money.It makes me sad, I wish it were the 90's again. WAH!LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY"
1,Trash...,"""I didn't know retards could get recording contracts!""- Fed UpAnyone who would waste their time with this piece of plastic should pull their head out of their *** and get their hands on a copy of ""Dark Side of the Moon"" or ""Wish You Were Here"".Backstreet Boys = Music? Hardly..."
1,Did I Miss Something?,"Golly! I didn't find out until the other day that BSB came out with a new CD last summer. It's called ""Never Gone"" and I didn't even know BSB was trying to make a comeback! No one tells me anything! Anyway, I listened to at least 2 songs on the CD and then I couldn't take it anymore. BSB will only be known as one of the many corny, untalented boy groups in American music history. Believe that!"
2,Just Like Every Other CD Out Today,"This CD is very unoriginal. It has a more mature sound than other Backstreet Boys albums, but it sounds like every other male artist's albums that are coming out. Nothing about it stood out to me."
5,BSB - Never Gone,"Never Gone got #3 US and spent 10 weeks on the Billboard top 200.it consists of the singles Incomplete (#13, 20 weeks) and Just Want You To Know (#70, 2 weeks).it has went platinum since its release in the US.5/5"
5,Best CD I've heard from them.,"The Backstreet Boys CD is amazing. It's definately by far their best album yet, and they have ALOT of albums out there.On a scale of 1 - 10 I'll rate the songs for ya!Incomplete - 10Just Want You To Know - 10Crawling Back To You - 10Weird World - 9I Still... - 10Poster Girl - 10Lose It All - 8Climbing The Walls - 10My Beautful Woman - 10Safest Place To Hide - 10Siberia - 9Never Gone - 10Overall: 10I love this CD. Best I've heard in a very long time by anyone. It's insane. Their sound now is more Pop/Rock. I recommend it to anyone. Even if you USED to be a Backstreet Boy Fan, you'll love this CD. Also I know many of you have Incomplete on the radio, if you like that song, you'll LOVE this CD. It's amazing <3"
5,they kick ass!!!,well personally i have been waiting for them to finally come back i bought there cd and the song i like the most is crawling back to you.thats how i got my ex girlfriend back we was together for 3 years and i sang this song to her and she fell back in love with me so thats why they get 5 stars there cd is more mature and i still like there old stuff but this one is good also
1,WORST CD MADE BY ANY BREATHING LIFE FORM,"HORRENDOUS, AWFUL, PITIFUL, WRETCHED, AND MOST OF ALL MAKES YOU WANT TO BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF."
5,Backstreet Fans have been waiting...,"Much anticipated album of the summer, a long wait for Backstreet fans. I've heard 2 songs off the new album, and I am definately excited about the soon release date of ""Never Gone"". The boys have regrouped after much needed time off, with fresh material that the fans are sure to enjoy. Let's make this record number 1!"
1,Disappointing,"Doesn't even sound like the Backstreet Boys. There is not a great song on the album. Most of them are boring and sluggish, IMO.I agree with the reviewer who thinks the 5-star reviews are planted. No way this is a 5-star effort. If you liked Millennium you'll probably be very disappointed in this one. Gone are the melodic songs with soaring harmonies.It's too bad because this is a very talented group."
5,Great Comeback,"Back when the Backstreet Boys first came out, I was in my teens, and was a huge fan of them. Now in my 20's, I bought their album, and expected the same bubblegum pop. Listening from song to song, its the same ballads - not really different, and some of the more upbeat songs, are a little different, but not very good. This album kind of remided me of the album Nick Carter released last year. I do have to admit there are a couple songs that are really good that have the same sound and beat as BSB from previous albums. I would have to say I like BSB because they're one of the few artists that are still good out there."
1,PURE UNADULTERATED TRASH,"NEVER GONE is what music should not be.My ears ached after listening to this nonsense in a pub.This is lousy,syrupy teen pop music at it's worst and is only meant for girls below 12 years of age.These guys are as bad as N SYNC and BOYZONE.Thank god the awful era of the boy bands has come to an end.These guys were all about style with no substance.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING OR HEARING THIS AWFUL ALBUM.Get MASTER OF REALITY from BLACK SABBATH instead."
1,"OMG, OMG ,OMG!!!!!","OMG!!! BSB is back!! I've been waiting for a vapid, vacant, and meaningless distraction!"
1,Face the Nation part2,"More appropriate title don't you think? After all the Backstreet Boys were essentially the New Kids on the Block of the late-90's. Which sums up nicely how much music has been in the toilet for the last few years, when one of the worst groups in history is one of the most influential groups out there(see also *Nsync, and every other boy-band)So their back, let em. Hopefully if there is a god this will be just a hickup and BSB will take their rightful place alongside NKOTB, Milli Vanilli and Vanilla Ice on the musical wall of shame."
1,horrible album,"I never liked backstreet boys. Sure they had few catchy pop tunes but at the end of the day it's not real music it's all pop fluff that sounds the same and is marketed to young girls. I'm ashamed to be part of a generation where girls were into these guys, and I was into old school r&b music instead, from which backstreet boys rip off heavily. Chapter 1 of their career was pop, this album is an attempt to be rock and it doesn't work"
5,Great Comeback!,"Being a huge fan from before, I just couldn't wait for this one to come out! I went and bought it right when stores opened and it was well worth the 4 year wait! It has an amazing track list of wonderful songs! It's one of those cds you can listen to straight through without having to skip any song! I'd definatly recommend this to anyone!!!"
5,WOOO!,"this cd rocks... it's like the backstreet boys were actually NEVER GONE! their voices improved... but they still sound like our backstreet boys! woo... this cd is great.. and i KNOW it is so great, cuz i own 2 copies... lol for now.... i will own more probably later on.... but for now i own 2.. all the songs are so beautiful and you can tell they love to sing and they are glad to be back just by hearing them sing! GO BUY THE CD!.... NOW! lol... love always,AJ McLean's #1 'Beautiful Woman'... Leslie!"
5,It's Like They Were Never Gone!,"After the long deserved break, the BSB jumped right back in with both feet! They are still the best all around band out there. I bought both the dual disc and the regular CD."
3,It's... well... different,"I have always enjoyed Backstreet Boys, and can easily admit I have all their albums. I was really excited when I heard a new one was to be released and happily bought it.I'm mixed in my feelings. Whilst it's great to see them branching out into more 'mature' music, I feel it's a hit and miss affair. Many of the songs are too similar and the lyrics about the same thing.Arrangements are pretty good though, and some of the chord structures are nice.All in all, a bit disappointed, but I still like them and their music."
5,An Awesome Comeback,"I've finally gotten my hands on this album, and I must say, I'm pleasantly surprised. I lost interest in the BSB during their Millenium and Black and Blue phase, but ""Incomplete"" rekindled my love for good ol' Backstreet. Every song has a distinct flavour, and like fellow reviewers mentioned, there isn't much upbeat material in here, however, I feel ballads is what these boys do best. In addition, I'm glad they didn't ""sell out"" or try to change their style according to what's ""hip"" right now, and kept pretty much true to material similar to that of what they got famous for! This is like a more refined version of ""Backstreet's Back"" album. Favourite track: ""Climbing the Walls"".Bravo!"
5,Backstreet Boys forever!,"""Never Gone"" is a thrilling album that shows that Backstreet Boys have STAYING POWER and will never disappear! I'm loving every minuite of this thrilling and unforgettable masterpiece. Wow, the songwriting, vocals, and melodies are SO GOOD! Buy now and don't be the last to know!"
5,Never gone,The backstreet boys have been around from about 1995 since then they did about 5 of there original cds.This is there new album Never gone.My opinion of this cd is that this is one of their best albums they had ever made. The songs that I love is Incomplete and others . FROM THE BACKSTREET BOYS FAN NUMBER1 ADAM.
3,backstreets back,"i have been a fan o backstreet boys from the very beginning. in saying that im not realy a fan of pop music but i like some songs of backstreet so because of hat i say im a fan. i bought this ablum jut to add it to my collection and i did like their first single incomplete. as ive listen and continue to listen the cd is starting to grow on me a bit. its not their best and definately not a 5 star album, but some songs are really good. my favz are incomplete and never gone. other ok songs include poster girl, and track 2. for all backstreet boy fans, u won't be dissappointed, all u rnb fans wont really find it gud except for never gone, but for a pop album its a bit above average, and thats pretty good for a come back album. alo check out mariahs new cd, - its pretty gud. peace!"
5,Backstreet's Back,"Their beautiful voices are again on a CD for all to hear. They sound wonderful, and the album is a must have for any Backstreet Boys fan! Enjoy the boys, and enjoy the music!"
5,Backstreet Boys are Back & Better Than Ever!!!,"I bought the new backstreet boys cd and it's absolutely amazing! They are seriously back and better than ever. Every song has so much heart and emotion in it. Every song pretty much blew me away. If you didn't like the backstreet boys before, I'm telling you...give them another chance. I'm almost speechless. I abosolutely love it. =)"
3,Worth a Listen,"Boy-band hater or not, these guys have carved a niche for themselves and they truly stand apart. Not the best album in the world, but several noteworthy tracks. The best of which is ""I Still..."". Don't judge without listening to it first."
5,They're Back!!!,"They are back, and with an album that will blow your mind. Featuring amazing songs such as ""weird World,"" ""I Still,"" and their smash hit ""Incomplete"" 'Never Gone' sets the stage for the rebirth of a great career. With a more mature and raw sound the Backstreet Boys proved that they are back in full throttle."
5,Definitely a must have!,"Just purchased the Never Gone CD and, although I have heard sneak peaks and such, nothng compares to actually having the CD in your hot little hand. This CD is much more mature sounding and I suggest if you haven't at least listened to at least one of the songs. please do so. It has an edgier sound, like they promised it would. It's full of passion and a must have for any fan, as well as a must TRY for those who aren't sure of the whole ""comeback"". They truly have been Never Gone in our hearts!Shelliewww.backstreets-back.com"
1,"Music fine, but...won't play on 2 of 3 CD players!","The music is fine on here, but the disc itself wouldn't play on 2 of my 3 CD players and wouldn't play on 3 of 4 computers. I purchased this because I didn't like the idea of the alternative - the copy-protected CD.They lost out on a sale!"
5,It's about time!,"I know with all the drama and time spent doing their own things, it was a rough road for The Boys to tread. But they are finally back! And with an incredible new CD out!This CD is above and beyond from the first track - and what first track it is. ""Incomplete"" is a rock ballad made for the desperate broken-hearted. One of my favorite tracks. Also, ""I still..."" is nothing to scoff at. A call for the one that got away to come back. Another of my favorite tracks. I've recently taken a gander at the new video for ""I Just Want You to Know"" and nearly died laughing. It has become one of my favorite music videos and I suggest everyone check it out! Finally the boys are flashing their humor to more than just the ""true fans"" who watch the tour/backstage videos and interviews.Boys, if you read this, I love the album and keep up the good work! Oh, and welcome back. :)"
5,Such an AWESOME cd,This cd is so awesome. The 5 year wait was definitely worth it. I recommend it to anyone and everyone because well there is just no way you won't enjoy it.
5,never gone is right,"i really enjoyed all of their songs. they sound great and the music really rocks. i recommend this cd for everyone. and if anyone gets the dualdisc, thats really great too."
5,BSB were never gone,"It's been a few years since the Backstreet Boys released their last CD and the change in their music is clear. ""Never Gone"" is a clear growth from their past albums. It has a more mature sound, even if the songs are a little emo. The boys' voices sound great. This is an amazing CD so be sure to check it out!"
2,Not Worth Buying,I was very disappointed in this CD. I remembered this group as being much better than this.
2,NOT FOR IPOD,"Love like 3 songs, but you can't put THE DAMN THING ON AN IPOD AND IT DOESN'T SAY COPY PROTECTED ON THE CD ANYWHERE. I got mine at Target. Um, get it at itunes for 10 bucks or download it. TOTALLY ANNOYING HOW ARTISTS COPY PROTECT CDS! MOST PEOPLE THAT LOVE MUSIC HAVE AN IPOD!"
1,Frustration has taken me over,"I was conflicted on how to rate this cd. I was definately a big BSB fan during their first era and I do love the songs on this new cd.HOWEVER. and this is a pretty large however. They have tried some kind of copyright-copyproof thing on this cd that I have yet to ever come across. And this protection prevents me from uploading the cd on my computer. I figure their logic is that if you can't get the cd on your computer you can't make a copy. But I don't want to make a copy. I WANT TO PUT IT ON MY IPOD. How stupid is it to make a cd that you, essentially, can't listen to. I don't even own a cd player. I put all cd's on my computer and then upload them onto my ipod and plug speakers into my ipod. I had to play the cd through the DVD feature. This infuriates me and I intend to send the cd back. It's not worth the effort.I love the Backstreet Boys but I will not buy a cd player souly for their cd."
2,...,"I guess older guys and girls would like this CD, but i don't think kids do ( such as me. ) I never liked BSB, but I recently heard this CD and it's not very good. There is definitely good lyrics, but if this was directed at kids, kids like to listen to fast paced stuff. ( most of them, like me. ) There are a lot of slow songs on this CD. ( I hate slow songs. ) But then there are very few that are a little faster. I think I would only recomend this to a fan of BSB, or a fan of soft rock, or something along those lines."
1,Siberia? I dont think so.,"How can these Backstreet Boys actually write a song about Siberia? They don't know a damn thing about foreign countries. All they can do is sing into a microphone, look pretty for the camera.Screw them. No literally. I would just screw all of them and throw them in the trash can where they belong. Lastly I'd pour curdled milk all over their crippled bodies! YAY!"
1,Never gone long enough,"This is definatly a bsb album alright. It is talentless, over-rated, bubble gum bullsh**. Unless you are either an adolescent girl or a brainless moron you will recognize this as such. if you wish to listen to some real music here are some suggestions:Danzig-any album except blackaciddevil, which was just too industrialType O Negative - any and all albumsBlack Sabbath - The albums on which Ozzy sang of courseMorbid Angel - Blessed are the sickEmperor - any and all albumsExodus - any and all albumsSlayer - any and allMetallica - any album released before the black albumForbidden - Forbidden Evilthat should be a good start to some real music.Now if you are an adolescent girl or a brainless moron and want to listen to this bsb junk despite the advice to avoid such crap then that is your problem, just don't whine about those of us who know better."
2,The Comedy CD Of The Year,"Driving the line between has-been stardom and ersatz nostalgia, this painful redux into the lost art of 'boy bands' couldn't be more blatantly manipulative, right down to the almost indistinguishable videos, to the uneven mix of hideous ballads and uptempo dirges. What made these boys [men] so irresistible before were their inherent urges to bestow beauty on the landscape. `Millennium' was a teen near-classic based on 4 of the first 5 cuts alone, with their ethereal vocal flourishes wafting you toward reverie signifying nothing but pulchritude. Here, the gasping of the voices, the pomposity of each trying to out sing the other, and the song selection prove this to be a fatal error in judgment. What could have been a growing up process morphed into the 3rd coming of New Kids On the Block. Max Martin, where are you? My grade: C+"
3,BSB needs to pick up the pace!,"First of all, I am a HARDCORE fan, have every album, and many of their European single releases (and album)I enjoy my BSB with a more Eurodance feel (like on Backstreet Boys, their first European cd)so I may be bias, but this isn't what I expected!~The name of this cd should've been ""I Should've Never Let You Go! parts 1-12"" or something...ALOT of them are about not wanting to let someone go....very odd IMO that there isn't a different topic mentioned too often...All of this cd is mid-tempo, to slow. If you are looking for Backstreet with a little flavor (like Everybody (Backstreet's Back) or We've Got It Goin' On, or even The Call) it won't happen here!Everything is in Bon Jovi/Hilary Duff style, which is not bad, just different..kind of rock...ish I guess...I am confused on all of the esctatic reviews for this cd, I don't think this is their best work (I'd say Euro BSB or Millenium would be the top) but it is worth having if you are a big fan..."
5,AMAZING ALBUM!,"This album is simply breath-taking in its quality. If you want and enjoy genuinely superb quality singing along with tasteful, fun, well-written and mature songs, this album is perfect for you. I actually enjoyed every single song on this album which is a rarity for me when it comes to albums. From the soulful, heartfelt Incomplete to the sheer fun and rock awesome nostalgia of Just Want You To Know,(from which I absolutely guarantee you will find yourself gleefully singing along to no matter what type of music you enjoy), to the unique self-awareness of Weird World, as well as the smooth, slick sound of My Beautiful Woman, and the jaw-dropping harmony and emotion of I Still.(If you can, get the cd extra song called Song For The Unloved which is such an amazing song.)Every song on this album could be a single and should appeal to anyone who loves great quality rock/pop...Hands down among one of the BEST albums I have EVER purchased."
5,FOREVER BSB!!!,"I love this CD!!! The Boys are definitely back!!! If you like the other CDs by The Backstreet Boys, you will LOVE this one! The boys are back with a great mature sound."
3,"Not there best, but worth listening too!","True BSB fans will truly love this cd, it grows on you like the band. Don't expect 'boy band' dance music. The group expects it's fans has grown with them. 1)Incomplete, 3)Crawling back to you, 4)Weird World, 6)Poster Girl are all great songs. The rest are okay but if you love BSB then you will have no trouble liking the rest of the songs. I'm a BIG BSB fan, I just wish they made at least, one danceable song."
5,Backstreet Boys (Never Gone),BACKSTREET BOYS ARE BACK! After a well deserved break the new cd is out and all 12 tracks are awsome. The dual disc comes with the video of incomplete plus behind the scenes of incomplete. This is their best album yet.
5,A step in the right direction,"This is exactly the album Backstreet should have followed up Millennium with. Don't get me wrong, Black and Blue harbored some good tracks but this is definitely the direction they should have headed in in the first place for longeviety's sake. The album is geared towards the adult contemporary market with a host of mid-tempo songs. Strong catchy choruses with their trademark harmonies make for a pleasing listen from beginning to end. Very enjoyable! Welcome back, Backstreet."
5,BSB DONE IT AGAIN,"These boys once again created a good album, maybe it is because they are much more mature or something else but this album is great with songs like Incomplete, Never Gone, Weird World, My Beautiful Woman and Poster Girl...Keep going guys and great job!!!"
1,These freaks are out of style like Y2K!,"This Backstreet Boys record tanked BIG TIME. Nick Carter is now a woman beating coward as he knows a guy would annihilate him. Brian Littrell says he found God, he found schlong instead. AJ can't stay away from booze. Howie and Kevin are as it appears the two lone sane ones. However, Incomplete and the rest of this album proved that teen pop is over. The last reviewer needs to be pecked with a beak."
2,Gets 2 stars cuz Incomplete is OK.,"This is the most ""Equalized"" sound I've ever heard. Jeez, let the microphones record what they're singing 4 real, and you'd have a lot of disappointed fans. The songs are ***yawn*** most of the time, and some try to be different rather than be GOOD SONGS. A better choice would be Duran Duran's Astronaut, it's just a much better ""pop"" album. If you're a BB fan, though, my opinion probably doesn't matter."
1,not worth my money,"backstreet boys are basically the male equivalent to hilary duff, lindsay lohan and ashlee simpson and all those wannabe rockers who don't have talent. They even went for a more rock sound this time but I'm just not feeling it."
1,Just awful,"Please, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I'm looking at the overall rating, then the album title, then the rating, then the title, and if I'm not reviewing the Backstreet Boys CD, then someone please tell me, because a 4 star rating for that CD is messed-up.They use voice enhancements! They aren't real! They just sell their bodys! UGH! They don't write. They don't produce. They really don't do anything but fill the piggy bank at Jive.(...)Avoid ALL CDs by The BSB."
1,This group stinks! Why won't they go away?,"Is it just me or isn't that boy band craze supposed to be dead and buried? It was bad enough putting up with the Backstreet Boys and their sugary lovesick ballads in the 90s, why bring it back now? No offense to you BSB fans, but the Backstreet Boys really were an awful group. None of them had listenable voices, and their love ballads were so sweet and sugery it made me sick. Listening to a Backstreet Boys song is like drinking a litre of maple syrup...that sickening sweetness makes me feel awful just thinking about it. I only give it one star."
1,LOL,Someone's review said that these guys were 'Rocking on...' I find the hilarious. How pop tartos rock out? Shouldn't they be 'popping on'? Hmmm.....
5,Well Worth the Wait!,"This is a CD worth waiting for, if you are a genuine fan. Incomplete is a wonderful way to begin, and the first time I heard Siberia I cried & love it. I have one CD in my car, one in the house, and one in my office. It is so nice to listen to music you can figure out the words & sing along to. They are still magic!"
5,Their best CD yet!,"I love the Backstreet Boys and when i heard their new CD was out in stores, i had to get it! I love Never Gone, it is so good! I think this is their best CD yet! I saw them on the Never Gone tour and they were amazing! The CD shows a mature side to them, it is great! I love the songs on the CD, it is the best! If you haven't brought the Never Gone CD, you have to! It rocks!! BSB forever!"
5,Weapon of mass seduction!,"Wow! I've been a BSB fan for 10 years now and I never been disappointed in everything they've done! But this time I have to say I'm more than happy about this album! What a come back! Gotta buy this album everybody! The group matured a lot, vocally and musically! I swear...their voices are weapons of mass seduction! If I would have to pick some favortites...afeter 5 listening I would have to say Crawling Back To You, Beautiful Woman and Safest Place to Hide!Oh yeah...that's true...Backstreet's Back! ALRIGHT!"
5,I'm Lovin' It,"At first I thought that the music would be like it was 5 years ago. But, the boys have grown right along with their fans and continue to make music that thier fans will love. I am so proud of the guys and this album. I can't wait to see them live. Awesome, Awesome album!!!!"
4,Backstreet Boys will never be gone,"I purchased this CD about a month or so ago after hearing ""incomplete"" on the radio a few times. It really started to grow on me so why not check out the rest of the album. And to my susprise, the songs were in a way quite different from their older stuff. But in all, I loved it. The more mature sounding music really stands out. Tracks like ""incomplete"", ""crawling back to you"", ""climbing the walls"", and ""never gone"" just to name a few. In all, a good cd, greatly recommended"
3,"Good, but lacks variety","I think that this album was made well. The songs are a lot more mature than those in the previous albums. I have to say, I was a little disapointed in the fact that few songs are fast or dance worthy. The second song on the album is one of my favorites because it has a little flare, which I think would have been a better route. Lots of slow songs. After awhile it's hard to distinguish one song from another. They are quite similar. Overall the cd is pretty good, but it could have been a lot more upbeat and eclectic."
5,Backstreet's latest CD does not disappoint,"I'll admit, seeing the Backstreet Boys on TV these past few weeks, I found myself thinking, ""Man, they're starting to look pretty old."" But when I bought their latest CD today, I was not at all disappointed. It is the same old Boys with an increased depth.You can really tell that the Boys have reflected on many of their life experiences in order to accurately account them in these songs. Many of the songs recount breakups, something that has been left relatively unexplored in past albums.I could go on and on, but in order to truly experience the wonder that is the Backstreet Boys, I highly suggest that you buy the CD and listen to it yourself. You won't regret it."
3,Meh....,I have been waiting for this album for a LONG time and I still feel like I'm waiting. This album isn't bad but it's not good either. None of the songs really pulled me in and made me want to listen to the album over and over again like the other albums did. Hopefully my second listen will be more enjoyable...p.s. they should of called this album Nick Carter featuring the Backstreet Boys. We never hear any of the other guys sing! What happend to Brian leading the way!!
4,sounds like it will be amazing,"I have only heard three tracks from Never Gone: Incomplete, Climbing the Walls, and Poster Girl, but already i know the album is going to be good. Cant wait for it be released!KTBSPA"
1,SONY DRM Copy Protection Will Cripple Your Computer!!!,"Stay away from this CD!!! Do not buy!!! You will live to regret it if you put it in your computer!!! And BTW, it won't play in most car CD players and some home stereo CD players either. What good is the CD if you can't listen to it? Why doesn't Sony want us to be able to transfer our music the mp3 player of our choice? Because they want to force us to buy THEIR proprietary mp3 player with it's proprietary battery pack and its proprietary memory stick. Screw them!"
1,Disappointing,"Doesn't even sound like the Backstreet Boys.I agree with the reviewer who thought the 5-star reviews were planted. There isn't a great song on the album. Most of them are boring and sluggish, IMO.If you like Millennium you will probably be very disappointed in this one. Gone are the melodic songs and soaring melodies.It's too bad because this is a talented group.I hope they can do better next time."
5,"Shakespeare Travel Mate Kit Spinning 6'6"" Fishing Rod / Reel Combo",This rod works great for our camping trips. It stores in it's own case so nothing gets tangled. It works just like a regular fishing rod. When you extend it the joints stay out until you push them in to put it back in the case. I've seen other rods that are loose and keep closing up when using them. This one is a good quality fishing rod that I would recommend to anyone.
5,simply amazing,"This book is a must read. It is easy to read, and even easier to implement the lifestyle changes. This book has changed my life, if you only read one health book this one is it! Bravo Sam"
3,Timex Unisex T5E961 Ironman 30-Lap,"nice little watch, even though the size specifications are listed, it's more useful as girls watch. looks tiny on my wrist. however handy enough to slip underneath my wetsuit sleeve"
2,Watch is OK If You Can Wear It,"The watch is fine, but the watchband is resin (plastic) and like others I have owned, break within a year or so from normal flexing. Mine did and I cannot find a replacement band in stores or online. Thus 2 stars because the watch works, the band doesn't."
3,unisex size.,"The watch was very nice lookong. tje only problem is that it is very small for a man. it should be listed as a womens watch, not unisex.thank you, Mike"
5,Never without my watch!,"I bought this to replace my older Timex Ironman watch since the plastic piece that held the band down split in two places. I tried super glue but it wasn't sturdy enough for me.I love this watch for running as well as school/work (nursing). The second counter as well as the date and weekday make my life much easier. It has an option to beep once every hour, and I like that for when I'm busy cleaning or studying and it helps keep me on track.I can swim and shower with it on without any problem - that way I don't have to take it off since I have a habit of misplacing or downright forgetting accessories in my busy schedule. I wasn't sure about the band compared to my older one (that one had the large holes in band) because I was afraid it would make my wrist sweat. I usually just leave it a tiny bit loose and I have no problems.Overall, I love this watch."
4,Strap will evenually break but love the watch,"I love the features on this watch, the last one I had the strap cracked about a year into use but I'm willing to order more straps to keep the watch."
5,watch,My daughter is loving the watch. We got it for her at Christmas time. She said she needed it for running track. It does awesome for her to keep track of her time.
3,A Novel of Suspense...,"A Novel of Suspense... That is what caught my eye on the cover of this book. This is the first book that I have read by Diana Diamond. Although I enjoyed the story and was caught up in it, I didn't really feel a lot of suspense. When I finished the book and begin to think about it, I realized that I never really felt that racing heart and clammy hands that I usually get when a book is very suspensful.Theresa Santiago does appear to be very ""Hand that Rocks that Cradle""-ish at first. She is a very complicated character to understand and after reading it, I still don't completely understand her. There are still many unanswered questions that I as a reader have.The book was just a fun read. It had a great plot with a couple of unique twists. Overall, I enjoyed the book and will definitely try this author again, but I won't have as high expectations for suspense."
3,Typical storyline with few twists...,This book was a struggle to get through. I had this book and nursed reading it for a month. Nothing really gripped me. It's just like something you would see on a movie of the week or one on the lifetime channel. I swear I've seen a movie basically identical to the whole story. This was my first Diana Diamond book and it makes it obvious to me why she writes under a pseudonym. Being associated to this book might hurt her other books sales.
4,The Babysitter,"This was a great vacation or easy read for an airplane trip,a good gift also, both my husband and I enjoyed it. Kept your interest and was a page turner!"
4,I couldn't put it down!,"If you enjoy suspense novels, this is for you. Gordon, a successful businessman with political aspirations, encourages his wife to hire a young minority to care for their children during a three month summer vacation. He hopes that publicity photos of the girl with his family will earn him more votes in the upcoming election. Plus it will give Ellie, his wife, more time to work on his dissertation.Early in the vacation, Teresa, the babysitter, is caught in a lie. The reader naturally assumes that she is secretly a villain who will tear the family apart. However, as more is revealed about each character, it becomes more and more unclear about who is good and who is bad until finally the book comes to a dramatic (if unrealistic) climax.This book is a quick, light read -- perfect if you're at the beach or on an airplane."
3,"Good for encouraging you, not big on techniques.","Lots of common sense stuff. However, if a refresher and ""coach"" would be helpful to you, then this is a solid book to read."
1,Save your money: check this book out of the library!,"Miller touts the benefits of changing jobs frequently, and of bringing in one's own team to your new employer to cut costs. What costs will that employer incur when he and his loyal team shove off again? Miller has loyalty only to his bank account."
1,waste of money,"Wait until your are doing well at your present job then change jobs, of course going to a new one that pays better. Thats the book! Why spend the money."
3,Petey's bookies,"This was a good book, capturing the confusion and fear of a young kid in combat who learns he is indeed a coward. The dialogue is excellent, the battle scenes are excellent but the ending is very incomplete, seems hurried or reads as though the author just didn't have any more in him and so he ended it. Too bad as I was mentally giving the book a five star rating as I was reading it. The ending however seems to have defined the book."
4,good story - unusual,My daughter went to school with the author so we both read this book. It's a really good story - different than the usual war story.
3,Not a bad read,"Articles of War wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't a great book. I thought that it spent a lot of time leading up to the conclusion and then the author ran out of story and so he just quit writing. Maybe the publisher told him to cut it short. Either way it just seemed rushed."
5,Greast movie making camera!,"I have had this video cam for over a year. The picture clarity is the best and it is extremely easy to use. I have had the still pictures developed at Costco/Walmart and they rival any good digital camera.I have created many a family movie with Microsoft's free movie maker software. For the guy who said he can't get it on his computer, all you need is a firewire cable and movie maker (which is free with Win XP~ plus movie maker2 is downloadable free from Microsoft's website) Plug the camera in and the XP system will identify it. It worked great for me!Love my video cam!"
2,Poor Software and manual,"Had the camcorder 6 weeks and I'm not happy. Video quality might be great but what does it help if you can't get anything else than still pictures onto your computer. Someone wrote in another review that this is not true. Well, if he is right he is welcome to provide the help that the poor software and manual doesn't give (hoej@sol.dk)"
3,No movie recording,"I would have given this Video Camera a 5 star rating had I been expecting what I got.I selected this camera over Sony DVR70 because this has higher still image resolution, has a bigger LCD screen etc.But one thing that was most important to me and is conspicuously ABSENT is the ability to DOWNLOAD MOVIES on a PC. This camera will be as good as useless for me if I cannot download movies. I can only download still images and that is not much help.I wonder why they have MPEG4 listed in the specs. In the manual they mention that the associated software downloads videos. But I tried the software and read its manual to the end. Nothing. So I called Panasonic for operational help and they said that I could not download the movies at all.I will now try to get this back to Circuit City and get the Sony DVR70."
1,Fa Roll-on Deodorant Aqua,"don't know how good the deodorant worked, I couldn't get past the strong, cheap smell of perfume.I tossed it in discard bag after trying it !!!!!! and washed my underarms."
5,Exciting and romantic read!,"Lovers or romantic suspense will be thrilled to find River of Dreams. I know I was. Don't miss this funny, romantic and exciting story. I'm looking forward to getting her next book."
2,"Impressive exterior, but extremely limited","I found this to be an extremely attractive camera -- small size, yet seems substantial. With the promise of USB and VGA-quality, this camera seemed like a sure thing. And when it came, I discovered features that I never expected, like a self-timer and a tripod mount.Alas, the pictures are terrible. First off, the camera is only useful in bright light (forget any kind of indoor shot unless you can stand a very dark, red-tinged image -- which rules out webcam use); and no shot that we tried quite came in focus. Moreover, the software to transfer is awkward; the USB does not support mass storage (where the camera appears as another disk drive), instead you use the supplied program to manually download.As much as I and my nine-year-old son wanted to like this camera, it has serious flaws and it's not worth even its rock-bottom price."
1,"Ankerberg, selling his own agenda","I started to read the book in hopes of finding out more about Freemasonry. I soon found out that Mr. Ankergerg simply put Masonry on a hit list. He is not an expert on Masonry and in fact makes up much of what he writes about the Fraternity..I wonder how someone who is so full of hate can consider himself a man of God? A much better and factual book on Freemasonry would be ""Born In Blood"" by John J. Robinson.Sincerely & Respectfully Bro. Manny Blanco Moreno ValleyLodge # 804 Moreno Valley, CA"
1,Ankerberg strikes again.,"John Ankerberg is a master of destruction against virtually every institution except his special outlook an christianity. This book, like his whole series, takes ideas and presents them completely out of context. If your a hate mongerer, this books for you."
1,"Quoting the author, Robert Shapiro, on ""Search for Justice"":","""This is a work of fiction that reads like nonfiction.""No more need be said."
5,great read,"When I first read this book, I didnt know what to expect, but I was completely immersed within pages. I just wanted this love story to keep going and going. I cannot wait to read Mr. Fagan's next book, and I will definately be first in line when it comes out!"
1,Piece of sh___!,"I've had two of these. They are so frustrating. The mechanism that locks the ruler into the square wears out quickly. So what happens is, you set the ruler to scribe a board, and it moves while you're working, and the next time you use it it is out of adjustment. I'm gonna buy a good one (Starrett) this time"
1,Couldn't muck through the racism to find the info,"The Nabrits did an exceptional job of homeschooling their 3 sons, but I never finished the book. The rhetoric of racism and the Nabrit's ""Ivy league status"" was like a recurring theme on every page that took away from the purpose of the book. Was this a biography or a homeschooling book??? I came away with 2 things....all white people are bad, and she is (self-described) smart. I felt like it was her outlet to tell her story of mistreatment, and not a practical homeschooling book. I have moved on to practical, helpful, not negative, homeschooling resources."
1,Racist book towards white people stay away.,I started reading this book and couldn't get past the pages upon pages of racism that she spouts. This woman obviously feels that her Ivy League education makes her better than everyone else and seems to make every little thing about race. What she accuses her peers of she herself is guilty of. She is racist against white people and that is all this book really is about for her. Definitely NOT worth reading.
3,"OK, but vertical vials are off just a bit...","Empire Level 330-36 Polycast Level, 36-InchI bought this tool for outdoor projects, such as leveling 6x6 treated timbers. Local stores don't sell 3' levels.Pros:- inexpensive (Home Depot sells the 4' version of this level for just over ten bucks, so the 3' model would probably go for about eight dollars.)- extremely light (12.2 ounces).- middle [horizontal leveling] vial on my level is perfectly accurate in both directions, and it's on the very top, making it ease to see.- black embossed [inches and metric] ruler markings on the bottom;- yellow frame makes it easy to find outside or in a cluttered space- made in the U.S.A.Con:- both of the vials for vertical leveling are off about 1 degree; and they can't be adjusted. That makes the tool I received OK for things like fence posts, but not good enough for precision vertical leveling."
5,"Life is Hard, God is Good","I can only imagine how hard it must be to work in the news. News reporters have talk to people when they are at the lowest points in their life, but Jody Dean points out that if a person is willing to look, there is evidence of the hand of God at work in every story. We might like to see big grand evidences of the goodness of God, but God understands things differently than what we do. I highly recommend reading this book if you are wondering where God is when something bad has happened."
2,Too confusing...I didnt enjoy the movie...but curiosity is there.,"I havent read the book, but now I would like too. The movie was too confusing, I wasnt sure at first whether or not the main girl was a ghost or what. A customer at work explained it to me and then I understood. The girl did die and the whole movie was what she had envisioned in the two seconds before she died. I didnt really like the movie, I'm not an Uma Thurman fan at all, but I would like to read the book to see if it'll explain in greater detail. This movie rents really well, a lot of people are immensouly curious about it and have deemed it a ""work of art"". I found that you have to devote your entire attention to this movie, or you are really going to become lost like I did. So if you got alot of time to sit and think i would watch it, but if you have a short attention span and are easily confunded dont watch, you'll feel that you haave wasted your time."
3,Don't read this cause I'm giving stuff away!,I loved the movie and thought it was great up until the end and that sucked for me because I don't have a clue what happened and I still don't. It would be great if someone would post on here what the heck really happened. Put a warning on the review or something. All along I'm thinking Diana lived and the other got shot and then Diana gets shot in the bathroom so what was the whole Diana as an adult with a husband and baby Emma that she aborted! I don't get it and I was so mad when it ended. Because if the other one lived then it would have been her life they were showing. I'm just assuming it was some things young Diana was thinking as she was dying that never even happened. Who knows! Otherwise the movie was really really good!
2,Not my style of movie,I came across the title of this movie online one day. Watching the previews it looked like a GREAT movie. After watching the movie I realized the style was not my style of movie. The movie uses a lot of flash backs. I am not a fan of that type of movie. It is a great idea to a movie tho!
1,"""that sort of thing""","""For those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like."" (From ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"", 1969 movie.)This quote sums up my impression of ""Her Life Before Her Eyes,"" which will appeal to imaginative persons who are smitten with the brooding, out-of-focus atmosphere. Although the acting is excellent, and the directing is good, the movie fails to deliver and to me, it comes across as a pretentious fantasy, a monumental waste of time. The flashbacks and overdone repetitions may enthrall some viewers; for me, they seemed like padding and made me impatient.Also, as someone who has lived in academia for several decades, I must point out to Hollywood types that philosophy professors rarely live in large houses surrounded by trappings of wealth."
3,QUESTION!,okay what was the part of the movie about her going to the hospital when she was younger and then with her boyfriend and the blood and she is like if this gets any worse i have to go to the hospital i am soo confused there
1,WHY DID I WATCH THIS WHOLE MOVIE?,"I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THESE OTHER PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THEIR REVIEWS, MAYBE THEY ALL TOOK THE SAME PILL AND WATCHED IT TOGETHER...WHO KNOWS. LET ME PAINT THE PICTURE FOR YOU. IMAGINE A BEAUTIFUL VIBRANT FLOWER DESPERETLY PUSHING ITS WAY THROUGH A STEAMING PILE OF DOGGY DOOKIE, AND THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE MOVIE HAS ITS MOMENTS AND MAY EVEN KEEP YOUR INTEREST FOR A WHILE, WITH THAT IN MIND THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TURN OFF THE MOVIE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES PRIOR TO THE END CREDITS AND COME UP WITH YOUR OWN ENDING. DON'T GET ME WRONG I LOVE THE ""ARTSY"" MOVIES AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY, BUT COME ON."
4,"Thrilling, Gripping Drama","One of the most thought-provoking dramatic thrillers I've seen in a long time. The acting by the entire cast was stellar, with Thurman, Wood and Amurri giving powerful performances. This is a movie that will keep you guessing and engaged until the final credits roll. You'll find ""gems"" in it upon repeated viewings too.While other reviewers mention details of the film, I think that more enjoyment can be derived from knowing little or nothing about the story before watching the movie. ONLY after viewing it, I highly recommend the BEHIND THE SCENES feature, which is nearly 55 minutes long and goes into enjoyable details of the production, characters, story, and cast. That feature clearly WARNS viewers that it is a SPOILER feature and should be watched after seeing the movie. My hat is off to whoever put that warning there. I think it's especially warranted for this film."
4,Movie with a twist,I really enjoyed this movie. It keeps you glued to your seat to find out what happened. Would recommend it to anyone.
3,too much work,Maybe if I watched it again I'd be able to pick up on more but I just don't want to invest the time. I thought that the acting was good. Was her daughter real? Just too much work to figure it all out.
1,not satisfied,I was very disappointed with this shoe. The leather was very stiff and thick. I knew it would irritate my foot in walking. The size was right--the fit was wrong.
1,unacceptable,"this is a collection of books that can be found for free on the internet. This collection, is not something you need to purchase, since you can just search for these items and download them. I wish you the best in your spiritual development."
1,A Ploy to Make Money?,"""The Da Vinci Gospel: What Dan Brown Didn't Say, and You Were Afraid to Ask"" is just a compilation of books from PDFs found on the internet. They are full of typos and other errors.Considering the highly opportunistic and misleading title (""Dan Brown"" ""Da Vinci""), the only reason for this book's existence, that I can think of, is that someone wishes to make money through the work others.Try this site if you are looking for Samael Aun Weor's books: http://gnosticstore.org/"
4,Good Read,"I liked it alot...But then again, I love RM Johnson...I liked The Million Dollar Divorce more, but glad I could add this to the collection..."
5,"Magnificently written, a definite page turner. A great work!","This is an excellent book, the plot and characters were well thought out. RM Johnson did a fantastic job. This was the first book that I've read by him and I thought he captured each character well, I couldn't wait to find out what happened as the book progressed. I look forward to reading any of his other works, and will continue to support him as an author if he continues to write like this.Towards the end of the book I thought this isn't going to be a happy ended but I was shocked and surprised at what happened in the last few pages.This is a book well worth the money and more, a book that I could definitely see myself re-reading in a few years."
5,OWESOME,"I read this book about 5 years ago. It was owesome. My daughter would read the book whenever I would put it down, so I guest you could say that we read this book together. These two sister's in this book were something else. One good and one bad. This book was a page turner.I loaned the first copy out and it was never returned, don't remember who borrowed it. So bought it again to keep in my library and I may suggest it to my book club.The two sisters have been named after alcoholic beverages, lol. This book for too much, meaning it was a great read. I recommend this book to all."
3,Good Book,I liked the book but the idea of a grown man dating a high school girl did not seem to fly too well with me.
3,O.K. read,"This book was just alright. I thought it was unneccessarily long at times, but overall it was an ok story. For someone who reads as much as I do, you will find the story to be predictable. If you're looking for something to read just to pass the time, then this is a book to choose. If you like books that are fast paced with a good edge, then this is not the book for you. Overall I gave it a 3, it wasn't great but it wasn't awful either."
3,This book is just GOOD,I liked the book because the charcters were so realistic. I didnt like how this book ended because it was so predictable. I wish RM Johnson could have been more detailed about Hennys relationship with Rafe. This book did make me cry at the end. I hated for it be over I wanted to know more so I hope there is a second book maybe call it The Marriage Game. Ha Ha!
3,Is this USB1.1 Hub?,"The title and features say USB2.0 HUB, but the data and manual are obviously for USB1.1 as Max speed is 12M. Iwas looking for USB2.0 Hub....."
5,"Plug, plug, play with ease","Like the other reviews claim, this product is blazingly simple to get operating. It took me under 2 minutes to plug it into the wall, plug it into my laptop, turn on my laptop, plug all my other USBs in to and then become completely happy. I've accumulated far too many USB devices for my two ports on the back of my laptop and have been very frustrated that I often couldn't use my mouse because I had to swap it for my microphone and webcam, external harddrive or flash drive. Now, I'm content and quickly realizing I could have used even another four more ports..."
1,Not for iMac owners,"I have an iMac (2.33 GHz, 24"" Aluminum, Mac OS X Leopard) and a 160 GB iPod Classic. When the iPod is plugged into the Linksys hub, iTunes reports that the iPod is connected to a low-power, low-speed USB 1.1 hub. Very disappointing. This hub's going back to Amazon."
2,Dumb Design,"Sure it works fine, but who is the BOZO that designed this thing?The USB ports come straight out of the back of the unit which means you have to have access to the back, this can be a pain if you want to put the thing on a shelf. The real PIA is that they went and gave you a 90 degree power plug which interferes with it's own USB input cable and prevents the unit from sitting flat on a desk!!!Did anyone at Lynksys ever actually plug one of these units in??I have mine dangling by the cords, that seems to be the only way that you can use this thing.It's basically an extension cord, so don't be sold on the Lynksys name as I was."
4,Is a USB 2.0 Hub - Amazon link is wrong,"This is a USB 2.0 hub per the Linksys.com site. Amazon has the wrong documentation linked to the product page. My four star rating is not relevant because I don't own this product yet, just researching at this point, but prospective buyers should know about this bug on Amazon's site. I'm very happy with other Linksys products I have and I'm sure this one is just fine."
4,Like every other Linksys product I have purchased...,"...plugged it in and it works flawlessly. Some have complained about how close the ports are, I can see that, but if the box was larger, others would complain about that instead. For me it is ideal.Only issue I have is the L-shaped plug for the power, a straight in plug would have worked much better given the diminutive size of the hub."
5,Worked Great Right Out of the Box,"Having tried and been disappointed by two other non-AC powered USB hubs, I finally bought something that works great. Easy to plug into, easy to start up, and has worked flawlessly. Fits flat on the desk out of the way, and always runs cool. AC powered is the way to go!"
3,Not bad but has a few quirks,"The device seems to perform generally well.. I was concerned however that the product claims to be fully internally powered but when I connected my WD passport 160gb disk directly to it the drive was underpowered clicking and not initializing properly. I plug the same drive directly into my laptop and my car stereo and there is no problem.Also note that the power adapter is huge taking up 3 sockets on a surge strip easily. The connector to the device is L-shaped facing to the left. As a result the cables do not settle well and device remains ajar many times.Other than these, the device ""seems"" to work well though I have not tested the speed and performance to each device connected to it."
4,"Good Hub, but the Cable is Way Too Short!",I agree with the other reviewers on this hub -- it does exactly what it's supposed to with minimal problems. The only problem is the 3 foot long cable! This might be something to consider if you're getting the hub so that you won't have to reach for almost inaccessible ports on your computer all the time. You might want to measure the distance and possibly order a separate cable when you purchase this hub.
5,Nice little hub!,"No problems with this one. Works very fast for me. For those folks that say it's running slow, I wonder if you're using the right cables - or if you're hooked to the wrong port(?) Cables can sure make a difference.Cons: cables plug into back but lights are in front. USB cable to the PC is quite short (but reaches in my case).Neither of the above criticisms is bad enough for me to give this little unit less than a 5 star rating. It installed easily, and works well. Well done!I wish manufacturers could standardize on a connector so we wouldn't have to use so many darned cables - but that's another issue."
1,Allergic,"This medicine is very bad, I have an allergic reaction,that sent me to Emergency room,with swollen face,skin rash, itchy and I could feel in a minutes I could not breath anymore!Be Carefull..."
5,WORKS GREAT,LOAF BAKE CUPS WORKED GREAT. EASY TO GET OUT OF THE METAL PAN AND COOL. MADE GIFT GIVING A BREEZE!
4,A good introduction,My need for learning about the use of NMR in determining structure in biomolecules was the main driver for me choosing this work. It turned out to be a good desk reference and a fine introduction. There is a good link between recent primary literature and this illuminating text which clarified a number of the basics which clearly improved my understanding of the primary literature and therefore this was a very useful text book.
3,"Nice try, Mr Glazov","It seems people never give up trying to start ridiculous smear campaigns against some of the greatest political leaders of the past century. Mr Glazov has it in for Diefenbaker. He's just dying to make Diefenbaker look bad. He wants Diefenbaker's blood. But it's not going to work, Glazov! Everyone knows who caused the Cold War (the United States) and all the gallons of white paint you try to throw over this fact aren't going to change it. Anyway, just remember, I know what you're up to, and I'll be watching you Glazov. I give this book three stars because it's at least a nice try. Glazov's a liar, but a talented one."
3,The Money Man,Yeh this is that palm trees and 80 degree heat music you gonna get that true bottom sound pick this one up for the daddy dollars song and the gip the mutant song he rips it. Grab a six pack of that red budweiser and some black and milds and cruise.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"This is the probably the worst cd i've heard this year, i didnt buy it but my friend did and we listened to it in the car and im tellin ya man, this is wack. of course you would know that a cd titled pimping on wax would be bad but not this bad, he can't flow, his lyrics are dumb and the beats are bad. how he ever got a record deal is beyond my knowledge, if you want to hear a bomb cd, get Ja and stay away from jt money."
3,ATL RAPPERS COMIN' OUT BIG,"J T MONEY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW GOOD ATL(atlanta)RAPPERS ARE. THERE IS JERMAINE DUPRI, OUTKAST, AND 112 WHO HAVE BEEN GREAT EXAMPLES OF THE SOUTHEAST RAPPERS. J T MONEY HAS A GREAT BEAT, BUT AFTER A WHILE, YOU WILL GET SICK OF HIS SONGS. I THINK THAT THIS CD WILL BE BIG, AND WHO DAT WILL ALSO BE BIG ON THE CHARTS THIS SUMMER. BUT THE DOWNSIDE TO THIS ALBUM WILL BE THAT AFTER REPETITIVE LISTENING, YOU WILL GET SICK OF PIMPIN' ON WAX."
5,jt money's tha pimp,"This album is amazing. It pisses me off that not that many people know who JT Money is. Best Tracks: 2, 3, 8, 10, 11, 12"
4,JT Money has some Phat Tracks!,"If your into some good clubbin' music, this cd is for you. This CD is slammin with bass and a great beat. Who dat is on almost any self respecting dj's roster."
3,JUST AVERAGE,"AFTER ALL THE HYPE BOUT THE FIRST SINGLE WHO DAT .. YOU WOULD HAVE FIGURED THIS ALBUM WAS GOIN TO BE THE BOMB .. THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE FOR SURE WHO DAT IS THE CUT.. BE HEARING IT ALL SUMMER IN THE JEEPS, BBQ, PARTIES.. BUT FOR THE REST OF THE CD.. IT IS JUST AVERAGE.. NOTHING AS HYPE AS WHO DAT ON HERE .. J.T LYRICALL SKILLS ARE LIMITED BUT DOES MAKE UP FOR IT ONE SOME TIGHT BEATS THROUGH OUT THE CD .. SOME OF THE CUTS TO CHECK OUTWHO DAT HO PROBLEMS DANK PLAYA @SS SH!T WATCHA WANTOVER ALL NOT BAD FIRST EFFORT"
4,A Good Reasonably Priced Aromatase Inhibitor,I've ordered SAN Estrodex Aromatase Inhibitor twice. I believe it has been beneficial. I take it because I receive Testosterone shots for andropause and I wish to avoid a possible conversion/increase of Estrogen. I'm not sure if it is the best Aromatase Inhibitor supplement but it has been one of the easiest to find at a reasonable price.
3,Great camcorder but it's missing something,"I absolutely adore my camera... but I'm glad I got it as a gift. It's extremely expensive. The dvd viewing capability is good, the film quality is excellent but...It has no light. In dim/dark situations, it films ok and plays ok on the viewer but other readers like the computer or dvd player can't see anything. There needs to be a light for this. It looks like there is a place to buy one and attach it to the top but I can't find it anywhere at the Panasonic website.The software is also a bit of a problem. It doesn't work well with Windows XP.So, while the camcorder itself is excellent, it's peripherals aren't."
1,Don't buy this product!,"I have had my Panasonic VDR M30 camcorder since Christmas, 2003. I have made five calls to their tech support line, where their technical people admit there is a problem and tell me they are working on fixing the drivers for the camcorder's software to make it work with Windows XP. They refuse to return my telephone calls, and they refuse to exchange my camcorder for another model. They treat their customers very poorly. I would give this product, and this company, zero stars if that were an option."
2,what happened,"I bought this video camera to record the birth of my child. I got it and immediately checked it to make sure that everything was in working condition. It worked fine. Several months down the line I took the camera out to make sure what kind of card I needed to purchase for taking still photos. When I turned it on and tried to use it, I got the recording of sounds in the room but no picture. Now keep in mind I thought that I was maybe looking at the lens cap, but it was no longer covering the lens. I adjusted everything pertaining to the darkness of the screen and was still unable to get anything other than a black screen on the LCD or through the view finder. Thank goodness it is still under warranty or I would just be out $800."
4,Like it!,"Small, cute, fairly intuitive - works good, except night vision(not that great). Needed to refer manual for seeing couple of things - ""DVD needs to be finalized to play in DVD/laptop"" & ""how to connect AC power to finalize disc"". Very convenient that output goes to DVD disc directly! Price much cheaper than Sony DVD camcorder :)"
2,Don't go with Panasonic,"I urge you to take a look at the Sony DVD200 or 300 series camcorders. From soup to nuts the Sony product is much better. Do a simple compare and you will find that the Panasonic camcorder does not have half the technology or enhancements. If you are looking at spending 700+ dollars on something to record your families memories, I would consider spending an extra $200 for something that is going to give you pleasure throughout the years. Also, Sony has many add-on products (Lens, Tripod, Filters etc.) that are handy!My only advice is that if you are going to spend this much money, either wait until you can afford a real product or buy the right product first."
2,"Good Idea, but need great improvements","Great idea, but not very functional. I bought one and kept it for three weeks until I got frustrated and almost drop kicked it. Picture quality is OK, but very frustrating when you try to view it. DVD disc does not work w/ any computer or DVD player. It works sometimes when connected directly to computer."
5,1984 revisited,Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent. Story line is gripping. This is a scary and gripping Big Brother series where the government comes to own its citizens.
4,Entertaining but complicated to a fault,"Exciting but short of riveting. Possibly because plot is very complicated. Treachery at so many levels requires near superhuman organization which conspiracy wonks are so quick to embrace. If you buy into the possibilities this is a very entertaining series. Acting is superb. If we think the ending leaves us with many questions about the future-- I embrace a quote from a famous philosopher. ""Oh, how our problems are soooo complicated. But the answer is so simple"" -- dr Seuss."
4,What could be wrong with national ID's,A look into the near future of big government. The problem with universal identification cards. Maybe fiction but probably nearer to the truth.
3,Great story but could've been done better.,For a mini-series this could have been better. Great story but the main character seemed a little too flawed for being a genius. Unfortunately the ending was a let down. The only reason this was given 3 stars was the ride from a good beginning to the ending.
3,the ending,"I have to say as a whole the series was really good, but the ending sucked so bad I was like wow what a huge let down!"
1,JUNK,JUNKJUNKJUNKThe kids will hate this!It is absolutely terrible!Nothing like the real DDR game!Don't waste your money here!I tried to leave NO stars butthe screen wouldn't let me leavethe rating field blank!HORRIBLE!!
1,Total waste of money!,"Very disappointed! Do NOT buy this product. After only two songs, the poor quality ""music"" gave us a headache."
1,should have listened to the reviews,"Ok, so I read the reviews and thought to myself I shouldn't buy it..Well I found it for as low as $11.00 as it retails for like $90.00 on some websites so I thought what the heck for that cheap price, I'd try it anyway..I'm so dissapointed, I don't know where to start?? The box says stereo quality music??So I thought it would be like listening to the radio, um no..It was like listening to a video game..Who gets motivated with music like that?? Then the dance pad is cheap and hardly works right..Its bad really bad..I thought I was getting a good deal and would have fun with it, no..Please don't waste any money..Its not worth a penny...Listen to this review as I should have listened..Very unsatisfied..Its not worth the star I gave it but I had to put at least one or the review wouldn't take.."
1,Dance Dance Revolution TV Pad (No Console),I ordered the Dance Dance Revolution TV Pad (No Console) for my child this Christmas. It was defective right out of the box. Only one of the touch pads worked. Just another example of cheap junk shipped from China.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I was happy that I received a refund for this product.
3,Dance fun,"It's no Sony Playstation game but it does the trick. If you're a professional and have high expectations about the graphics, don't buy this game. If you have little ones (age 6-10), or your just starting out, and you have average expectations, you'll have fun. You can't expect a whole lot for the price you're paying. My kids like it. You have to put it away and break it out every now & then to keep it exciting. I think that's true with just about anything in life, right?"
2,BADDDDD BAD BAD.,I was made to think this was just like the DDR for Xbox or PS2.IT IS NOT.The graphics are HORRIBLE and remind me of old school Atari games and the music SUCKS. It's just lame bad quality arcade music. No words or anything.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY NO MATTER HOW MUCH OF A DEAL YOU THINK IT IS.DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT BUY.
1,Dont buy this!,"This is a very cheap version of DDR. It shouldn't be worth paying anything at all for it. Most of the time it doesn't register the steps and even though there are 50 songs, they have no distinguishable beat and are really cheaply produced. I cant think of one good reason to buy this game."
1,Don't buy anything from KANAdirect!!!,"As with the previous reviewers this is not worth the money spent on shipping. I would gladly spend double the cost to send it back. It might as well be labeled DDR for you cellphone, the graphics and music are horrible. At least your cell phone could play decent music. Doom had better music to dance too. As I too bought this not wanting to spend the money on a console it not worth it. You'll be sorely disappointed. mannyman"
3,let me clarify the mixed reviews....,"If you've never played a Dance Dance Revolution game before, then this pad is perfectly OK. Go ahead and get it.but.....If you've played Dance Dance Revolution before, and you're expecting the classic songs that are listed as being available, and semi-decent graphics, you will be HORRIBLY disappointed (as I was) with this game.The music is in MIDI format; it's tones. That's it. Follow the sun, If you were here, all those classic Dance Dance Revolution songs are nothing but computer bleeps and blips that make a horrible attempt at sounding like the originals.But if you've never played DDR before, then you'll never know the difference."
4,Good for little girls,"Here's the deal with this item: it's fine for little girls (and I suppose, little boys that are inclined to dance) who haven't been exposed to a better dance game. I got this for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter; she takes dance, likes dancing, has never had or known about another 'Dance Dance Revolution' game, and she LOVES IT. It's a big hit; she's jumping all over the place, adds up her score at the end of each song, and it's been a great, cheap gift, with exercise to boot.No, it's not sophisticated. Older kids or teens (not to mention adults) would grimace in pain over the ancient graphics and lousy sound. For them, get one that goes in their PlayStation or whatever.However, many 5 year old girls don't have a PlayStation, or need one. This is perfect for them. For $[...] and shipping, it worked out great for a little kid. For a teen, it's $[...] wasted. That's the difference."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!,"I wish i would have read more customer reviews before i wasted my time waiting for this game. I was trying to avoid buying a playstation because i don't play video games but this is just sad. Horrible horrible graphics, songs don't have any kind of beat. do not waste your time."
1,Total Scam,"This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution. It is NOT DDR. It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny. My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it. She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one. Well, the 50 ""songs"" all sound the same. They are not ""radio"" or ""stereo"" quality, rather just computer generated noise. Totally awful. Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance. Total waste of money and total false advertising. This company should be investigated. Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!!"
1,not satisfied with product,I bought this as a gift to my nieces and I was very disappointed. It did not come with any instructions so we had to try to figure out how to use it. It seemed very cheaply made and not worth it!
1,Dance Dance Revolution??????,Was advertised and even referred to as a Dance Dance Revolution tv pad and its not a brand name as advertised. If you are going to refer to a specific product and use the name of the product then sell THAT product not a knock off....just before christmas when there is no other option. We were disappointed that we didnt have an authentic brand name product. It is obviously a lesser quality as far a workmanship and the music and graphics leave a lot to be desired. We will be very careful from now on when purchasing something online to make sure the product is what it is being sold as.....
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,alright dont buy this. this game has cruddy 8-bit graphics(NES Graphics). the music is horrible! its worse the MIDI Music! its just stupid beeps that are made to sound like the song! the dance pad itself is very bad too. it slides all over the dang place and it breaks down in days. also the sticky pads included are bad too they wear out in about a day.
1,Worse product I have ever purchased,"I rarely get taken, but I did this time. One song played 50 times. No instructions. Pad not in tune with TV movements. This is going to a garage sale or charity."
2,Not the real DDR...,"My husband bought me this for Christmas, and we were both disappointed. The graphics are awful, some give me a headache. The songs are awful--they all sound alike. Its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard. The pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly. I've had it two weeks, and already I'm hitting the arrows but its registering a miss. I gave it two stars because my kids (ages 6 and 2) love it, but then again, they don't know any better. I am using it to get better at DDR, but then I will invest in a better pad and game."
1,Worst DDR Game Ever!,"I used to have DDR for Xbox and when my Xbox broke on me, I decided not to spend the money on a new one. However, I missed my DDR workouts everyday so I bought this as a replacement. I should have spent the money on a new Xbox. This product is not worthy of having the name DDR on the box. Imagine a dance pad game for Atari. Then imagine it is the worst possible Atari game you have ever seen, and that would be a close description of this game. There are 50 computer generated ""beeping"" monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you. The rythem and the timing is off on all the songs, and the dance pad is very poor quality. It wasn't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home. I wish I had sent it back without opening it. Now I'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take."
3,ITS NOT ALL THAT BAD...,I just recently purchased one of these dance pads. Its not that bad really. I mean what can you expect for 20 bucks...lol...its lil old in graphics..it reminds me of atari days...and the music isnt the greatest but its not the most horrible thing i have ever bought. I wanted to get this try it out and then see if i was really ready to buy the real deal spending about 50-70 bucks. I like it so far...its really fun.
1,THE WORST ITEM I HAVE EVER BOUGHT,"IT SUCKS ELETRONICS IS FROM THE STONE AGE , QUALITY (WHAT QUALTIY)DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Limited appeal,"If you don't have a gaming system then this will offer some appeal. It has great durability ... if only they played with it more. But, the graphics and sound are a bit annoying."
1,This is terrible. Don't buy it! The sound is very poor quality,"This is a worthless purchase. The sound is horrible; it uses an unpleasant, hollow, synthesized sound. The score keeper doesn't work accurately. I strongly urge you not to buy this!"
1,TOXIC PLASTIC!,"As soon as I received this product, I couldn't get over the fact that it emitted a strong toxic scent. Most likely this product is made from PVC plastic, the worst kind of plastic for your health and the environment! If you have children, I would steer clear of this product. Too bad they can't make a safer version, as it would have been fun for my kids."
3,Great for Exercise,This product is great if you're looking for more exercise. I get quite a workout and its fun. My 8-year old nephew even liked it the first time. Don't expect great graphics or music. It's pretty basic. The dance pad is durable and pretty accurate with the steps. I think this is well worth the money paid. Just don't expect anything fancy like the arcade or playstation version.
5,DDR without the high price tag,I for one am really happy with this product. The graphics may not be fancy but the game works great and it even has pinball as well. It's really a fun way to excersize and the kids LOVE it. I was worried that with it being so inexpensive that the mat wouldn't be responsive enough but surprisingly it is quite sensitive. My 4 year old can step on it lightly and it senses every step.
1,IT SUCKS!!!!,"The shipping was prompt, but the product is crap! Nothing like what was advertised, infact this is VERY false representation. The game has an original nintendo look to it, and no well known songs, also the music is such bad quality, seriously like listening to atari. DONT buy this product, you will regret it. I only wish I had read the reviews, before buying it. It would have saved me from the extreme disappointment."
2,Not what I expected,"This game makes me so mad because I waited all that time to get it, and then all my hopes were shattered. I wish I would have read all the reviews BEFORE I purchased the item! They don't even sing to the music, and the graphics are like PACMAN!...not cool. But if you dont mind looking at the horrible graphics, and dancing to way unfamiliar music then this game is OK. Its still fun dancing to... thats why I give it 2 stars."
1,Game Sucks,If you're looking for an atari quality video game then this is your game. I thought that the graphics as well as the music was absolutely horrible.
1,NOT Real Dance Dance Revolution Game!,"i bought this for my niece thinking it would be a plug and play version of the video game. this has nothing to do with the real Dance Dance Revolution game other than being a cheaply made imitation and using their name, which is not on the actual product. very disappointed!"
2,"Dance, Dance Revolution Plug-N-Play","Before buying DDR, I read everyone's reviews, and thought that after all of the bad reviews I might still like it. This product really fools you, this is why:~If you've seen regular DDR you know what the pad looks like, well the dance pad and the box looks normal...untill you turn it on!~It says 50 Songs, right? Well, it's not really 50 different songs. About 20-25 of these songs are a trick-they combine 2 songs and make it into one track.~The graphics are horrible...a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are.I wouldn't reccommend buying this...at all."
1,This is not a DDR,"This is only an imitation of the DDR, there is not even the name of the maker on the box. I own a kiddie version of the DDR-TV (no console) by Kunami, and the quality of sounds and graphics are way above this one. Here, the ""music"" is barely an electronic tempo, and the welcome screen says 2004... Don't waste your money, and look for something else."
4,"More of a text book than a how to, but great","This is one of my favourite beginners books for acrylic painting. Barclay Sheaks is both a fantastic artist and teacher. The book gives a lot of good tips for studio and material care, varnishing, and choosing paint (he covers all of the popular brands) which can be a difficult task when every book is sponsored by a paint company that says ""USE PROFESSIONAL GRADE PAINT OR YOUR PAINTINGS WILL LOOK AWFUL!!!"". Sheaks gives a more unbiased point of view, much closer to the truth than most authors.There are not step by step demos of projects, but rather things for you to study. This book can definitely inspire ideas, but will not hand hold you through a project. If you are looking for a project ""how to"" book, this is not for you. If you are looking for a great reference with a lot of wonderful art, information, techniques and tips you've found the right book."
5,I have no complaints.,"I like this book, but the front part of the book is pretty much common sense. The next part of it has some awesome techniques or brush strokes and it pretty much answer every question I had."
5,GAVE ME LOTS OF IDEAS,"I loved this book. It is not a book with lots of details on how to do every little thing. It is a book that has lots of ideas. Each page has an idea and tells you how to do it. If you want more in depth info you can look it up elsewhere. It made me want to try lots of different things, and gave me enough understanding to know which I would be interested in. Absolutely one of my favorite art books. Enjoyed every second of looking through it, and got lots of ideas."
3,"This is a 'what is' book, not a 'how to' book.","Description, title and reviews led me to believe this book was about techniques and how to perform them. After looking over the book I was dissapointed to discover the main emphasis though is to explain what a certain technique is, as opposed to how you perform a certain technique. In other words the demonstrations are few and very limited."
4,A good beginning,I recommend this for the beginner level acrylic painter. What you need to know to get started with a lot of great product information.
5,Very good book on painting with acrylics,"As a beginning artist, I decided to start with acrylics. This book was written by a master painter whose love for art and painting really shows throughout the book. Almost all of the painting illustrations throughout the book are his own works. As a true artist, he has tried different ways of working with acrylics, and has incorporated that into this book.The bulk of the book contains descriptions of different painting techniques and there is also an introduction section that guides you through what you need to get started.I found that the way the material in this book was presented, and the author's own paintings to be quite inspirational."
5,A few words....,I like this album so much that all of my passwords are one of the names of one of the songs on the album.
1,Ghetto Sugar,"Slow, syrupy and sappy, this is the kind music that gives R&B a bad name. I did kind of like `It's Alright', which is somewhat hymnlike."
5,R&B IN IT'S RAWEST FORM,"WHAT CAN I SAY DAVE HOLLISTER COME WITH ONE OF THE HOTTEST CD'S IN A WHILE.. IF YOU NOT DOWN WITH THIS RAW TYPE OF R&B YOU DONT KNOW WHAT'S UP ..CHECK OUT CAME IN THE DOOR PIMPIN, FAVORITE GIRL, BABY MAMA DRAMA, IT'S ALRIGHT, THE OLD MICHAEL MACDONALD REMAKE.. KEEP FORGETTIN, THE PROGRAM ..THE BROTHA IS OFF THA HOOK CHECK IT FANS"
3,"Good Stuff,Can Relate, Keeping It Real",I rally enjoyed this cd it take you to the good and the bad of to day's relationships .The melody are powerful the volcal are great.This is perfix mingle muisc.
3,better material would have made this disc a must have,Dave Hollister can sing.he has the voice to be a big time artist.but this material isn't working well with his voice.the lyrics come with drama but the music sounds so run of the mill.with the right material he could blow up.
4,One of the top ten R&B releases this year,"I just recently purchased Dave Hollister's new album,and I was pleasantly surprised.He has a great r&b/gospel voice,and I like all but 2 of the songs.The production is also solid,without using any of the ""flavors of the month"".I could have used a little less explicit language on some of the songs,but despite that,I feel this is a great album."
1,dead after 3 months,"i'm no windshield wiper expert, but these are the shortest lasting wiper blades i've ever bought. it was a hard winter and i park outside. but 3 months is too short."
3,A bit dense...,"A wealth of information, but not geared toward beginners. I'll keep this book to refer to it later on, but I need something more user friendly to start. Building awareness of internal organs while breathing is covered extensively in this book. I'd like to have begun with general breathing and body scans before getting too focused and specific. As someone else commented; the book is organized somewhat backwards."
2,bad fit,"Originaly I thought the top came with the side and end walls. Was unhappy that I also had to order a top for the unit. There was no advertising that there was no top included. I thought the top fit my 2"" frame, but it didn't and it is short on both sides. There was no advertising about what span was needed for the top. The material is paper thin. I do not recommend buying this product unless you know your frame and top measurments."
3,Wrong item,"It turns out to be a wrong item, I did not read right.Product was returned with little effoet, waiting for credit on Credit Card."
5,CLASSY LI'L BAGS!,"These are small bags, great for selling small jewelry pieces already in baggies. They have no width at the bottom, so you use them more like sleeves. The design is beautiful & looks very professional."
3,best remake ever,this is a great remaeke it even improves on the slowness of the other flim.all the perfomeances are good.martain shorr tis funny. some of the parts are lifted right from the orignal.the onolyy part i did not like was the scene where the two boys drive the car.itt felllt throw in therre like they had tonhave one last slapstick scene.
4,Father of the Bride,"Steve Martin is again quite humorous as George Banks in this narrative of his daughter,Annie's engagement announcement when she (Kimberly Williams)returns home from abroad. As an over-reactive father, Banks refuses to believe his little girl has grown up and he needs direction from his patient wife, Nina, (Diane Keaton)throughout the movie. Proud to be her father and refusing to accept monetary relief from his rich future in-laws, Banks reluctantly agrees to hire the expensive wedding co-ordinator, Franck,(Martin Short)that his wife and daughter have chosen. Martin and Short will keep your entire family laughing and/or crying in this hilarious yet sometimes poignant movie as you follow Franck's wedding plans and of course the big day for Annie.I recommend this movie for anyone and rate it 4 stars (out of 5) for it's emotional content and comedy."
1,UK Region code won't play in U.S.!,DVD was shipped promptly. HOWEVER - make sure you are getting a region code for the US else you won't be able to play the DVD in the United States!
3,DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL,"FATHER OF THE BRIDE is an enjoyable enough movie, but sometimes its humor seems forced and even Martin Short's zany wedding coordinator doesn't make us laugh as much as we hoped. Anyway, this remake of the Spencer Tracy original has some good scenes and a real sense of a father losing his ""little girl"". Martin of course wants to find fault with his future son-in-law, and does everything he can to sabotage the wedding plans, which are pretty expensive if you ask me. ($250 a head for 1272 people??). Diane Keaton does a stalwart job as Nina, Martin's patient but frustrated wife; Kimberly Williams is fine as Annie, the soon to be bride; George Newbern is a solid groom to be; and Kieran McCaulkin is a delightful and warm little brother. The movie pulls all the right strings and captures the agonies of marital preparation. Good but not great."
1,Dull,"If you are the type who, when going to Baskin Robbins 31 flavors, orders vanilla; and if you love, love, LOVE rice cakes more than any other food on earth, this is your type of movie. Bland beyond all belief! I want my money back."
5,Father of the Bride (15th Anniversary Edition),"George Banks is an ordinary, middle-class man whose 21 year-old daughter Annie has decided to marry a man from an upper-class family, but George can't think of what life would be like without his daughter. He becomes slightly insane, but his wife tries to make him happy for Annie, but when the wedding takes place at their home and a foreign wedding planner takes over the ceremony, George must try to handle the fact that people grow up. This movie definitely has it's share in sentimentality, especially towards the end, pretty much most of the last thirty minutes, but it is still funny, and you don't lose interest in it. A great family comedy, it is pretty much funny for all ages. This is a good movie to sit down with the entire family and watch. Most people will enjoy it, and most people will find at least a few things to laugh at in it. A heart warming movie that will make you laugh and cry."
4,its about letting go of your children,In this comedy Steve Martin is married to Diane Keaton. They do an excellent job and their daughter Kimberly Williams does a good job playing the bride to be. They hire a wedding coorinater to do the planning and Martin Short does a great job as the funny yet smart guy. They movie just works and it was a very big sucess and you'll love every minute of it. You'll feel like your of the family but you have to be the distant cousin.
4,One of my faves!,"Father of The Bride is one of my most favorite movies ever- with the portrayals of Steve Martin and Diane Keaton, this movie can't look bad!It's amazingly brilliant and special in its own way. I feel that Diane Keaton could have had a slight bigger part- I never can get enough of her, so it's no wonder that though I love this movie, I wish she could have had more scenes. 'Father of The Bride' is a movie you can't miss- it'll make you appreciate one of the most greatest actresses of all time!"
4,good if you watch once or twice a year,well i liked this movie personally. the acting was great and it was funny. but then my sister rented it week after week after week for about 3 monthes this went on she rented it every week for about three solid monthes! so heres the deal i wouldnt buy this movie but i would rent it every know and then.
4,One of hte best remakes of all time,"Steve Martin makes this remake not only one of the best remakes of all time, but one of my favorite movies. The original was slightly dated and stogy, with Martin it is fresh and free. The scene with Martin buying hot dog buns is a riot no many how many times you see it. The highlight of the film, however, is Martin Short's Franck. Say no more, just rent it."
1,constant freezing,"The picture constantly stopped through out the movie, I ordered 7 movies it was the only one I had problems with"
5,Purchase review,Really Fast Shipping! I was really happy with the product and it was just as described. Thank you so much!!
5,FAMILY NIGHT MOVIE,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie which I had no desire to watch. It was funny, hit home and all actors did a fine job. This would make an ideal holiday gift and the entire family will enjoy and relate to it."
5,One of my favorite movies ever!!,"This is a GREAT movie! It's a hilarious comedy! Also very sensitive. My favorite part in the movie is Franc, the wedding coordinater. :-) My parents don't ever buy movies for me, so I only own 3 movies, and this is one of them! It's FANTASTIC! If I had three thumbs, I'd give it 3 thumbs up! This is a movie you will want to watch over and over again, I did!"
5,It's a movie to watch over and over again!,This movie is probably one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. If you have ever been married or have a really loving dad than this movie will touch you so much. It's also a really good movie to watch if your in for a good laugh and a few tears.
1,Not good even at the cheap price,Bought as a cheap rod (4ft 6inch UL)to keep in the car for impromtu fishing trips. Rod sections jammed in place the fisrt time the rod was extended kind of defeating the purpose of a telescopic rod! Returned for refund.
1,junk!!!!,"I am really shocked with the poor quality of this rod, as I have other Shakespeare rods, I never expect they produce such bad ones."
1,Terrible rod. Please save your money and buy something else,"After reading the good reviews on Amazon, I decided to buy this. I wanted to replace another broken telescopic rod that I have for 1 yr. I was using this for crappies. On my first try, a small one took the hook under the rock. I tried to pull it out, my first light yank broke the rod in half. And no, it didn't get stuck under the rock. It is worst than the ten dollars rod that I bought in Best Buy. Yes, you heard right, Best Buy. They are not a sport retailer and they sell better cheap rod. I was so upset that I took the broken rod and tied a line and a hook to it to continue fishing. I ended up catching 10 crappies that trip with a broken rod. But seriously, BUY SOMETHING ELSE !!!"
2,Description Doesn't Match the Product!,Don't buy this product! I just received mine and neither the description nor the picture matched what I received. The handle is different and the guides are chrome without ceramic inserts. Beware.
3,Item not as shown,The pole is not the same pole as shown in the picture..no ceramic eyes..you would think after other complaints they would change the picture to atleast show the exact product that you are ordering..Looks like alittle false advertizing...other than that I guess it is worth the $14.00....
2,"Nice, until it breaks...","Pros:- super-light and sleek design- pretty good action- nice handleCons:- not very durable - it broke during the first bend (at about semi-circle, which should be more than OK for carbon rods)- Shakespeare warranty is pointless, as the they want you to pay for shipping the broken rod and attach check for $9.95 to send replacement. This way they get away with cheaper rods never replacing them, probably. People like me will go and buy a new one of needed.Overall - good for beginners, kids or when you need packing flexibility, but if you're serious about some bigger fish that will bend your rod to a semi-circle when fighting, do not buy this one."
2,Flimsy rod,"This is a flimsy little rod. In the description it states that it is a medium action rod. In my personal opinion it is way more flimsy that any medium action that i have used. On a good note, it does break down very small, so it is easy to fit in a suitcase or under the seat of a car. Would be good for the occasional fisherman or a child who is learning how to fish. I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality compact rod."
1,Telescoping rod,"I just received my 4'6"" ultra light telescoping rod. I ordered it to replace a similar rod that I have used for many years but lately had delaminated at the tip. This rod is nowhere near the quality of the previous one, although it should have been an exact replacement. As soon as I extended it, I could not get the last segment to retract. I have tried everything I can think of short of breaking the rod to get it to push back into the next section, but it is stuck like glue. Certainly not ceramic inserts in the guides. That is just false advertising! Very cheaply made. I do not recommend it."
2,Not What It Says!,"My wife and I use ""telescopic rods"" for fishing out of our kayaks. This rod collapses to a good managable size, and is only 4'6"" extended (perfect for our use). The problem is this item is described as having ""stainless steel guides with smooth ceramic inserts""! It absolutely does not have inserts, ceramic or otherwise!! This was one of the main reasons for buyingShakespeare Telescoping Spinning Rodthis rod over Eagle Claw's ""Pack it"". Very disapointing as this was bought for specific trip; too late to get something else."
2,Guides are not ceramic,Even the guides in the picture are not ceramic. They are very thin and look like they would put a lot of pressure on the line. I got an email back and they said I could pay for shipping both ways and they would give me my money back - not worth it.That was a couple months ago and they have still not changed the description. The rest of the rod is great but the guides ruin it.
4,good but not quite as adverited,"this is a good rod but it says it is a med, after using it some i would say it is closer to a light-med. still a good rod and feels like it is strong. is it easy to cast those ""little"" casts that you need to get around stuff so i do like it."
4,"Shakespeare Telescoping 4'6""","The 4'6"" model works real well for kids. Too small for adults. Well made product, stores real easy for travel. Only 1' long when fully broke down. Bought one of these a couple years ago and like it so I ordered a few more online."
5,Sultry Jazz Find... Rare treat in the US,"I first heard Keiko Lee's voice while working in Taiwan last summer. She is a Japanese Jazz Pianist and Vocalist. She has performed with the likes of Ron Carter and Lee Konitz. She has a throaty smooth sound in the vein of Betty Carter's voice. She throws herself into interpretations of Pop and Jazz standards with abandon and her sense of humor and love of music shine through on every track. Her recordings are hard to come by in the states and I have had luck finding them on Amazon and Amazon UK. This disc was recorded in Nov 99 in Tokyo. It features titles from her recordings such as ""If It's Love"", ""Time After Time"" and ""Lover Come Back To Me""- but live in concert with completely new and funky arrangements! A find for any Jazz Vocal lover looking for someone new to follow. Thank you Amazon for carrying it!"
1,A bit basic for most users,"If you've used the mac much at all, you'll find this book *very* elementary. I've been using the Mac for many years, and there isn't much in this book that you couldn't discover by reading the AppleGuide, or surfing around on mac sites.A waste if you ask me."
5,One of the best movies in recent memory,"Maybe seeing this movie brings back memories of a German girl I once used to know, maybe that's the reason I felt connected to this movie. This simple coming of age film just grips you in its emotional intensity, exudes a distinctive European film experience that I find intoxicating.Highly recommended."
3,Rape alert,"An interesting movie with actors reading their lines. The wooden acting shouldn't be a problem if you don't speak French. I personally like to know when I'm going to have to see a rape scene. The images and sexual language are interesting. The setting is gritty and realistic. The acting and story are faciful. This incongruence certainly isn't boring. For those of us who speak French the movie has a amateurish quality that adds to the surrealism. If you don't mind violence against women, it is an interesting watch"
2,be carefull,"i dont know why, ads technologies dont stop miss leading peoplethis thing dosnt capture correctly any anolog signal comingfrom video tape, of course many people claim it works well foredigital signal, like dv cameras or dvd player, but i thing mostpeople that have purchase this unit were planing on capturinganalog tape video. i can return the unit, because i just recently found out this F***** unit dosnt work and allready time has pass, the god thing is that in my efford to make this work i have learn o lot of stuff, anyway i dont have the money to buy a TBC unit to correct my videos, so i thing im goin to go for the canupos advc-100this one has tbc correction included wich is the main problem with pyro link, i dont get it if everybody allready knows whatsthe problem why they dont do something about..maybe ads technologies dont care for long term bussines."
5,"Finally, a way of eating that makes sense!","Easy-to-follow recipes, great, informative nutrition information - after all the fad diets I've suffered through, this book is a breath of fresh air. Not a ""diet"", just a simple, delicious way of eating that's easy. Amazing for me, who's always been a bit kitchen-shy. I love this book!"
3,Pity about the audience,Bon Jovi gave a good performance as they always do. I bought this for some of the songs I didnt have from other concerts.It was a bit subdued though compared to the wonderful Bon Jovi 'Live in London' one which I found infinitely more full of life.I think the auduience were a lot of the problem. Shots of the front rows show fairly impassive faces and not a lot of joining in - one even was seen to check their watch (well it was a Swiss audience!)It would have been hard to feel psyched up and carried along by this crowd (as they were in London)- though perhaps they felt there wasnt much to get excited about.
2,pretty disappointing.................,"i'm a huge bon jovi fan but didn't enjoy this videothat much. the video's quality wasn't that good, andthe band's performance wasn't that good either.it was just boring. i've only watched this once sincei bought it. live from london is much more better."
4,Fun!,"This Bon Jovi Crush tour DVD is not the same as being at a concert, but, perhaps the next best thing!"
2,"easy on the ears, murder on the eyes","There's nothing wrong with the performance or the sound quality here. No, the problem is the constant quick cutting from shot to shot. It's like channel surfing : a constant search for what else is on. Your attention is bounced around like a ping-pong ball. And the cuts come without rhyme or reason. Warning : this dvd will produce a pounding headache."
1,VHS quality DVD?,"Don't waste your time with this DVD! I love Bon Jovi, but this DVD stinks! The picture is VHS quality and the sound is cassette quality. Sounds like the drummer is playing behind a wall. Absolutely zero high end, and very muddy bass. If you're not going to take advantage of DVD technology, why offer it on DVD? I did not buy my Mitsubishi HDTV and Sony ES gear to watch VHS.This is by no means a gear or calibration issue. I have plenty of music DVD's that sound excellent on my gear."
3,Not one of their best,"I have loved bon Jovi for years, but i got to admit this is not one of their best video's. I was at the gateshead consert only the week befor this concert was filmed and what I can't understand is why they didn't film that concert! The night was perfect, blue skies, not a cloud in site and the band just rocked. On the night this video was filmed it rained, the guys were soaked and to me they looked far too tired and didnt put their usual effort into the show. Jon wasnt jumping around the satage like he did at Gateshead, but the music and the sound were good. I think only a true Bon Jovi fan will buy this video."
5,Managing M.E. with the Body Scan meditation,"I've had M.E. (chronic fatigue syndrome) for the last 3 years; this CD has transformed the way I manage both the physical and mental challenges of living with a chronic illness.Listening to the CD enables me to have ""constructive"" space for myself during the day, and helps me to keep perspective. It is useful as a way of breaking up different activities - ensuring that I don't over do it, but meaning that as long as I stop before I am too tired, I get more done in the day! It is also extremely relaxing - perfect for a racing mind in an exhausted body!Now that I am getting better, and have more energy, I still include the bodyscan in my daily routine, but often the 20 rather than the 40 minute version!"
1,badly received by a loved one,"Gave it to a family member with cancer. This person listened to it and the feedback I got from another family member was that it totally freaked the recipient out,upset him..in other words, that it was a disaster. I am obviously upset about this and will try to retrieve it at the right time to listen to it myself to see why the reaction was so bad. I really meant well!"
3,"Doesn't quite ""Deliver"" but there are some highlights","THE DELIVERY MAN is a mixed bag, filled with interesting ideas but lacking any sense of cohesion. The first cut, ""Button My Lip,"" sounds like an outtake form BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE, then we kick into country territory with guest spots by Lucinda Williams and Emmylou Harris. As much as he tries, Elvis never convinces me when he adopts the guise of country troubadour and there are too many tunes here that fit that bill. But just when I'm about to give up, ""Bedlam"" kicks in and I'm enjoying the wild stream of lyrical brilliance. Following this wildness is the slow burn of the title cut, with EC at his vocal best, a slow burn stretching out over Nieve's organ licks. Then the sarcastic venom with a bouncy beat, ""Monkey to Man."" (""Needle Time"" is a nice companion to this one) and I'm ready to forgive the likeable but instantly forgettable forays into country comfort. Not his best, but there enough classic tunes here to satisfy this EC fan."
3,"Well, it's better than Il Sogno...","but that aint saying much. Comparisons to BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE . are apt: this sounds a lot like left overs. And that's not entirely bad. The Cd has the same relentless attack on the ears, and he warbles on way too long, determined as ever to out bore Dylan. Yet the second half od the disc really is compelling. The Impostors, like the Attractions, bring out Mac Manus's more accessible tendencies, which is a good thing for all of us. This is not the snooze-fest of NORTH, nor the pretentious prattle of his Deutsche Gramaphone releases, and it almost sounds, at times, like the guy who used to write all those great songs. In any case, if you are a completist, pick it up. For the rest of you, if you have B & C, you already have this one as well."
1,Not This time,I love Elvis - own all his stuff. I like when he gets experimental (for example North and kojak Variety are both excellent). I hate to take shots at the finest song-writer of my lifetime... BUT...this is a horrible CD. It has not one song that caught my attention. When I was Cruel was a much better effort.I'm not writing Elvis off yet because he will be back with something better next time. But this CD can only be rivalled by Goodbye Cruel World for the low-point of an otherwise stellar music catalog by a fantastic artist.
1,Elvis fails to deliver - again...,"It's been all downhill since Imperial Bedroom. Ever since that good but over-rated album EC has been suffering under the delusions that he's a great Sinatra-esque singer and talented enough to dabble in all musical genres. A damn shame, since those early albums were as good as it gets - but apparently beneath EC now. No need to even comment on this latest atrocity - suffice it to say this is simply another limp, pretentious offering in what has become a seemingly endless string of limp, pretentious offerings."
4,Delivery Man delivers!!,"I have been a big fan of EC for a long time and even though it not rank up there with his earlier albums,it shows that he's trying different styles.This band sounds tougher and funkier than the Attractions.He's one artist who's never dwelled in the past,which makes him more intertesting than most of his peers.Though some of the folkier songs could've been left out,it's still a nice balance with the louder songs.This is more spare as opposed to Might Like a Rose,which had too much production and got in the way of some fairly decent songs.Great vocals throughout.....BUY IT!"
2,A Deserter From Elvis' Army,"Too Much Up Tempo, Not Enough Aggro! When Elvis started his campaign for world wide domination with ""Spike"" in the late 80's, I struggled hard to stay in step. Soon, I was being trampled! Elvis abandoned styles like an old suit of clothes. On ""The Delivery Man,"" lyrically, it's his worst cd to date. If many of the songs were written in Mississippi, he failed to absorb the influences and it becomes another ""Where's Elvis?"" cd. Otherwise, Die-hard Elvis Army Fans, carry on!"
1,Another disappointing release by the not-so-Angry Young Man,"OK, Elvis, you have proven that you can make records using every genre of music imaginable. And you have collaborated with every artist under the sun. Problem is, your career has become incredibly unfocused and your songwriting standards have sunk to all-time lows. This latest album isn't as bad as ""North"" but aside from ""Monkey To Man"", I found the songs quite forgettable...except for the opening cut ""Bedlam"", which is unlistenable! Now he's touring with Emmylou Harris....YECCCHHHHH. C'mon, Elvis, you can do MUCH better!"
4,More of a gripe than a review,"I know the local Japanese record market is so overpriced that artists put bonus tracks on their albums to give them greater value to consumers but so is the American market! We're forking out upwards of $20.00 sometimes for a CD at some outlets (Wal-Mart and Target excepted, but I'd much rather shop at stores that have decent seletions like B&N, Borders, Tower, etc., which are ridiculously overpriced to the point of usury.) We like our artists, too (especially Elvis), and would like the full value of our album-buying dollar. As brilliant as he is, Elvis is one of the most maddening marketers of his work with b-sides, bonus import tracks, vinyl pressings and now exclusive online tracks. That's too much babysitting for me to shell out for. Just give us a bonus disc, even if only online, but make it easy for us to find everything in one nice package."
4,"Okay, whatever","The whole reissue thing with Elvis is getting out of hand. Is he going to do this with every subsequent release? ""Cruel Smile"", ""Delivery Man Redux Deluxe Mad Ducks""...next he'll get Diana in on the act and we'll get ""Girl in the Other Room--Next Door"" (personally I'd like to see a ""Double Fantasy""-type Costello/Krall collaboration.) Thank God for iTunes. If you don't need the packaging (again) it sounds like the way to go (great cover pic, though, I have to admit). Looking forward to the tour. Maybe I'll buy a tee-shirt, if it doesn't become outdated two months later."
4,Sneaky Country Soul,"I like the CD. It didn't knock me over like 'When I was Cruel' which is still a great one to listen to.. nor did it knock me out like 'Brutal Youth' -which is STILL my fav EC... but there are some very good songs on this CD. I am still taking it all in, but there is some very interesting things going on here, and lets not forget that EC keeps fresh by not doing the same darn thing over and over again... it makes me look foward to the new CD's whenever they come out... creative people never work well with others as FZappa used to say.. and the restlessness of EC is a good thing. So, not everything has to be perfect for me to enjoy it... keep on traveling EC!!"
5,TECKNO 1.0 = NOW YOU SAW 2000 MUSIC!!!!!,"TECKNO 1.0 DEFINES THE WORDS ""TECHNO AND HOUSE MUSIC"" THIS CD IS COLOSSIAL! WITH HOT TRACKS LIKE 666'S AMOKK, CHRIS COX AND DJ IRENE'S ""SOMETHING HARD"" AND THE BEST TRACK OF THIS WHOLE CD WOULD DEFINATELY HAVE TO BE NRGY'S ""DRIPPING WET"" - WHICH I BELIEVE IS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST TECHNO/HOUSE SONGS OF THE YEAR 2000!! GET READY TO DANCE, JUMP, ROLL YOUR WAY TO TRACK 15 WHICH IS C'EST LA VIE; THEN FAST-FORWARD TO ABOUT 4:52 SECONDS TO BLAST AN EXPLOSIVE MASSIVE PREVIEW OF TECKNO 2.0, WHICH IS THE SOPHOMORE ALBUM IN DANCE/DJ/CLUB STORES NOW!!"
4,DVD Replacement,"I had the same issue and contacted Xenon Pictures directly. They were very nice and handled it well...They asked me to send them proof of purchase, so they could replace the DVD. Apparently there were some copies that were not edited correctly. I suggest that you contact them. This is their e-mail address: customerservice@xenonpictures.com"
3,Lola erase una vez,Fue bueno ver la novela en DVD. La estaba esperando q saliera mas sin embargo fue decepcionante al verla no tiene mas que 1/3 parte de la novela. El DVD no llega ni a la mitad no la telenovela.
2,disappointed,"I LOVED LOLA ERASE UNA VEZ ON TV AND WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE IT OFFERED ON DVD, I PREORDERED IT. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT ARRIVED AND I WATCHED IT. THE STORY WAS INCOMPLETE, IT IS NOT EVEN HALF OF THE NOVELA, IT ENDS AFTER LESS THAN 1/3 OF THE NOVELA, I KNOW THEY HAVE TO EDIT AND CONDENSE BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS. DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE WHOLE NOVELA IS GOING TO BE OFFERED OR IF THERE WILL BE SUBSEQUENT DVDS CONTINUING THE STORY? THIS WAS A GREAT NOVELA IT IS A SHAME THAT THIS IS WHAT IS OFFERED"
3,amazing but.....,I just finished watching this dvd set and it was an AMAZING show but...it leaves you hanging at the last episode on the last disc! I am so freaking upset about this and televisa and xenon need to fix this! I might email them about this and see if there is a full version with the other episodes cause i wanna know what happens to lola and monserrat and alexander! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRI give this a 5 out of 5 star for story and a 0 star for editng and leaving me hanging!
1,lola erase una vez,This dvd is rediculous OMG it frustrates me it doesnt have the good parts toward the end it stops like midway while ur just starting to get to know the characters you dont even get to see the other brother or lola and alexander getting close. and then the other dvd is like almost $40 and i dont want to take the chance of getting that one. i wish they would make dvd copies of tv shows just like they do for american tv shows or soaps.
3,DVD Does not deliver,"Was very disappointed with this DVD believing it to be a replay of the original telenovela - instead it is just a series of disconnected scenes basically highlighting musical numbers - would have preferred a shortened version of the telenovela which was very humorous, lighthearted and pleasant to watch."
3,Lola DVD,"I know that Lola..Erase una Vez is supposed to be a telenovela for teenagers, I actually loved to watch this show and I'm over 20. The only I didn't like is that this is not the complete DVD collection, which I should have known because this was released before the actual show ending in the USA, which was in late January. My fault for being so anxious to get it, but at the same time Amazon should've made a not in the product description stating that this was not the entire show!!! I'm waiting for the whole show to come out and can't wait!"
2,UPSET,OMG i have been waiting for this novela to get on dvd and enjoy it with my daughter and was so upset that it was all cut up..i know they have to edit it to fit it on 3 discs..but this was crzy...alot was so left out and the first dvd had repeated parts in it...did anyone buy one that was like this???
4,"A sincere rating - I love it, but would improve it...","This is my favorite hot-sauce. I want it to be a litter hotter though; I have to add several shakes to make my dish hot enough. I love the habanero and thank you for balancing its flavor so well. It is probably half-as-hot as I would make it - but I would rather have it concentrated so that I can use a few drops rather than several shakes. Just my opinion - a very good habanero- especially for those new to it, somewhat controlled - but I am asking 'try-me' to make it a little, just a little, hotter.Om and Peace,Khy'em Yeshua-Muhammed, Amri"
5,"Flavor, Not Just Heat","I was introduced to this pepper sauce at least ten years ago and have been ordering it by the case ever since. (In the earlier days when it was less popular, I had to pretend to be a restaurant in order to get it through a commercial supplier.)I do like very hot and spicy. But, what's special about this sauce is the flavor. You can actually enjoy the Habanero flavor without your tongue smoking. Goes on the scrambled eggs every morning. Good addition to barbecue sauces. Goes into soups, that 6-hours-of-slow-cooking chili made from scratch (or, the stuff from the can), ...."
4,Not the best but okay,I had a hard time squeeking out 4 stars for this hot sauce. 3 1/2 would be more like it. The reason being it's too salty. Melinda's XXXX Reserve is balanced much better than this one and the habanero flavor shines through more with the Melinda's. The only reason I grabbed this one at the store was because it was $2.99 compared to Melinda's at $3.49. Seems trivial but this might last me one week.
5,The Civil War in Oregon,"When Ernest Haycox wrote this book he was in transition mode; he wanted to write novels which were not ""serials"" or books which the magazine market would print that had to meet certain criterion. And that shows in this work. But that does not diminish his power and style as a writer of great historical fiction; it only enhances it. Adam Musick, a river boat captain, sees all of the gold coming into the city of Portland and determines to hold that gold for the Union instead of allow the Copperheads to take it and turn Oregon into a southern slave state. Lily Barnes is there to help him as he takes on Floyd Ringrose the leader of the southern faction. Haycox's characters are always complicated individuals and they often act and react to the situation around them, but they are always full and robust, and people you know you have met somewhere in real life. This is an excellent book."
3,good horror,"This was a good horror movie. I've seen it accused of not making sense in one of the other reviews. They must not have actually been paying attention, because the movie makes perfect sense.It's not the greatest movie ever, but it's certainly not the worse. It's definately worthy of a viewing."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS JUST BAD, BAD AND BAD. I REALLY WISH THAT I DIDN'T WATCH THIS MOVIE, AND IT MADE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT MYSELF BECAUSE OF THE SUCKINESS OF THIS STUPID MOVIE."
4,"Mysterious, homorous and educational","It's been a long time since I have picked up a book to read for fun but ended up learning so much. Skye Moody delivers all of this in a very humorous mystery that made me laugh so much I couldn't put it down. The main character of Rain Dance, Venus Diamond, reminds herself of Peter Pan and children think she is possibly a freak. Her family is enough to drive anyone insane and she has to deal with malaria. These aspects just make her a stronger and more outgoing person that everyone will grow to love. The Pacific Northwest is always a favorite backdrop for mysterious happenings but Moody is unique for picking the coast. This is a must-read for mystery lovers."
2,suffers from poor editing,"The author hangs a confusing, convoluted plot on an environmental theme. The heroine is given pretentious past and there are so many subplots introduced and then dropped that the reader can lose track of developments. The book suffers from a lack of editing. There errors and cliches that could have been eliminated by a good editor. My favorite was the use of the word masseuse to describe a male, when the word should have been masseur. This error occurs several times."
3,Decent,"Works good, but I have found it dries out too fast and needs often replacement. My prints come out excellent, however."
2,not what it says,"I called the company up. they said it was Motion sensor was resistant to rain and snow- they even said it had a seal in the batterY cover. while thats true. the seal didnt seal all of it. much of it is still exposed. I needed to duct tape every single exposed hole in it.Water still got in.I glued almost every orifice of the motion sensor. Rain still got in.The transmitter/receiver is very weak. u cant have the transmitter 15-20 feet without the signal loss.Avoid this product unless u are sure it will be A. close together. and B.no rain that can get to it.Update- when theres no rain at all, the unit works fine as long as its close to the motion sensor.i just got HVAC all weather duct tape to see if that will work- wish me luck"
4,The Great Gregson,"Have been a long time lover of Gregson music & needed a CD of ""Connatations"" for contest purposes to check my memory as the last redition of this number was by Black Dyke recorded some 10 years earlier.....well all I can say is that the French Horn Concerto is good, the other 3 pieces are sensational, superbly played and what a tuba bench, with all those sublime pedals as a bonus...great value all round !!"
5,THE SOUND OF THE BRASS,"I have had bad exteriences with British Brass Band music before,and I had made my mind up that the sound was not in good taste for my ears. One day I was in the record shop and I picked this CD up and took it home.It took me a while to get it or should I say like it.CONNOTIONS IS ONE BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MUSIC AND EDWARD HAS DONE A FINE THING WITH THIS TUNE. THE WHOLE CD IS VERY GOOD FOR MY EARS. I HOPE YOU FIND THE SAME THING AS I DID WHEN I GOT RID OF MY PREJUDIST ATTITUDE ABOUT THIS.I NOW HAVE ABOUT 15 TO 20 BRASS BAND CDs on the DOYEN LABLE ,THEY DO GOOD WORK IN THE UK @DOYEN"
3,Caveat Emptor,"Be forewarned: Much of the information in this book is inaccurate, and many of the authours opinions are simply regurgitations of news articles and reviews. At times it seems that Chambers has never heard the music he 's criticizing, or at least does not understand it. And it often reads like a high school term paper.To the book's credit, Miles and Quincy Troupe seemed to find it useful enough to plagiarize most of it for Miles' autobiography. Thankfully Chambers crams this book with enough information you and I were unlikely to find and compile ourselves to cover up his ignorance as a critic. And that he puts everything in chronologicasl order is the greatest achievement of all."
4,"fine book, but . . .","A fine book.But Chambers is also slightly upset, I think, that Quincy Troupe got to work with Miles on his autobiography and not he -- and what Chambers' book is missing is exactly the kind of personal material (and voice) you find in Miles' autiobiograpy (""Miles"").The best thing about this book is the discussion of the wider context of Miles' music and performance (""the times""), but without Miles own voice it degenerates through the end of Part Two into a kind of annotated discography (mind you -- that's not all bad -- it is accurate and gave me a few ideas for out of the way purchases).So, I recommend reading both this book and ""Miles"", for a complete picture."
5,Good fit for my VW Passat Wagon (rear window),It's great. Easy to install and works well at least for my VW Passat Wagon (rear window.) Check the size of your original wiper blade before buying.
5,works great!,im using this in an outside holding tank that all my water goes into from my french drain. my previous pump could not keep up and i always had trouble. with this pump the water is gone within SECONDS and i have no more worries!
1,"arrived damaged and not functional, poor packaging","Item arrived with the box damaged and the pump not at all functional. Amazon seems to be excellent about returning and replacing,"
4,Very entertaining,Updike's compilation is a pleasure to read. Terrific essays especially. There is a strong bond between all obsessed golfers. You will certainly laugh aloud. This book I feel is meant a little more for the golf player than simply an Updike fan.
2,Doesn't work with leather seats,Cool idea and I was thrilled to find something for my husband to organize his stuff but it does not stay put with leather car seats--the base slides out.
3,Great Potential!,"This was the beginning of a band that never quite got off the ground. It's tragic that future releases from this band may have been stunted due to Eva creating Shadow Project with her husband Rozz Williams. Shadow Project songs may have sounded awesome done by the Super Heroines. Rozz may have found a better outlet for his creativity, and still be alive.Either way, it's nice to have this."
3,"Very promising, but it doesn't deliver","I picked up this ""literary mystery"" with great glee. However, I found the book slow-paced, and the plot had more to do with the protagonist's sexual exploits and meanderings than a very interesting manuscript from the 19th century. The female protagonist, a poet and scholar, was believable, but the constant emphasis on sex, both hetero- and homo-, took away from the plot that left many loose ends. Very promising, but it just did not deliver."
2,"No 1/2"" socket holders and black","This came with NO 1/2"" socket holders. It's also black, not red as it's pictured. Decent item but now I need to order 1/2"" clips, pay shipping, etc."
2,Didn't get 1/2 size holders,"First off, the packet did not come with 1/2 size holders, which is annoying...poor quality control. Luckily I dont have too many that size. Secondly, they do not come on the rails, you have to put them on yourself, which is a royal pain and makes your fingers hurt"
5,Houses of history,"Need a quick and easy way to build up building for your railroad or dioramer, not too hard to build and with a little care will last a long time."
4,THE ISLAND SCARFACE,This movie is much better than i though it would be especially if your from the islands Worth every penny
5,**Gansta Jamaican Film: Highly Recommended* * * *,"This movie is very raw, full of excitement and gritty. When it comes to gansta flicks, this will also be noted since it shows a diff spin. It is truly the jamaican version of Belly."
5,Great movie,I loved this movie and I am so glad it will have a legit American release. It is violent at times but still entertaining and emotional. I recommend this to anyone who loves gangster movies.
3,SHOTTAS DVD,FOR THE MOST PART I ENJOYED PURCHASE..THE ONLY THING TO MATTER IS THATIN ONE PART OF THE MOVIE EXACTLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOVIE IT STOPS PLAYING. AND IN EVRY DVD PLAYER AND PLAYSTATION 3 I PUT IT IN..IT MAKES ME START THE MOVIE OVER FROM THE BEGINNING AND DOES THE SAME THING EVERY TIME IN THE SAME SPOT. BUT NONTHELESS I GOT MY PRODUCT.
4,awsome,"great movie,, if you are into gangsta movies this is somthing u have to see,, one of my favorites, buy it!!!"
5,my spouse liked it.,My spouse like it and wanted me to order it. It was a gift for him. Thanks. Will order again.
2,Pointless Jamaican shootup,"Two poor Jamaican youths decide to rob a vendor to get some money. The rest of the movie is a mindless repetition of Jamaicans stealing and killing each other, both in Jamaica and America. It never rises above a third-rate in plot, acting, characterizations, or special effects."
2,Ky - Mani was the best in Shottas,"The movie was okay, It really didn't tickle my fancy. Every main character in the film obviously doesn't like a woman of colored - What was that all about? I am totally surprise multi-racial women weren't been betrayed as some type of trophy. Ky- Mani was the man for real though."
2,Okay for a low budget gun flick,This movie is okay if you like low budget gangsta movies without any plot. People compare this movie to City of God and I have to wonder what they've been smoking. This movie is just like any of the other straight to Dvd movies starring a rappper except its about Jamacans in Miami
3,Review of Shottas,The film was ok. But i was thinking that the history was more exciting. But it's a nice movie.
5,Shottas,I love this movie. I saw it on netflix at one time. Which seems not to be there no longer. I found it on amazon. Com. It kept stopping but overall it was okay
5,All Dancers Are Students And Teachers!,"This is a wonderful addition to the literature on ballet. The auther makes her apologies in the beginning for not being able to include some noteworthiy teachers, but the ones she was able to cover are great. The information provided gives us valuable insight into the aesthetic principles of these great dancers and teachers. This should be useful to all dancers, whether they teach or not. Some very esoteric facts can be found here as well, such as why Balanchine likes the fingers and hands held the way he does and why many don't like it that way. I had taken some classes with a Mr. Schabel and discovered his claim to fame in these pages. The Great Jean Babilee is even discused. You might also get some good ideas for further reading in this book as I did."
5,Half The Price,"Purchased item for a Craftsman lawnmower at half the price even with shipping, than if I bought it at Radio Shack or Sears."
5,betron,I read the other reviews about other brand batteries and this one was the only product that had good reviews. I received the batteries in good shape and installed them. They worked as avertized and we have had no problems with low life.
5,Powersonic battery,Pleased to note these compact batteries are now of the AGM design and not acid paste. They should last even longer.
3,Too basic.,"This is definately a beginner book, and as a beginner book it probably deserves 5 stars. This book touches on many database topics, MS SQL server setup from scratch, ODBC connection with Windows, Windows security, structuring your data in the database, basic SQL syntax, etc.Unfortuneately, I was expecting more on OLAP and less about MS SQL server. The information specific to MS Excel and OLAP could be a simple 20 page read from the Excel 2000 help manuals or technet.As a beginner book, this is excellent because it gives you step-by-step instructions to set up the examples; however, if you are looking for more detailed analysis or understanding of OLAP, you may want to find a different, more advance book."
3,Works well as just a multivitamin,"My husband has now been taking these vitamins for a couple of months. He's the type of person who drinks coffee/soda and a few energy drinks a week for the caffeine. I had hoped these vitamins would help him enough so that he could cut down on other forms of energy boosting but he says that they haven't made any sort of noticeable difference. We're now debating whether to continue with these or just use another Rainbow Light multivitamin for him. Either way though, we definitely will be sticking with the Rainbow Light brand."
2,buyer beware - serving size is SIX tablets,"Somehow I managed to select this variety although I was sure I selected one that had a serving size of one tablet. Another reviewer called it to my attention, and I still managed to order one with a serving size of SIX tablets. What a waste."
2,I waited too long for nothing...,"This too-long awaited album was a great disappointment. Having worn out her two previous albums, I expected a lot more from this one. I think she's trying too hard to go after an audience that she doesn't need. What compelled her to work with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis? They're fine for performers who don't have strong voices but she doesn't need their trite, tired Pop formulas. The only decent songs on this album were produced by people she had worked with on the two previous albums. I just hope she doesn't repeat this mistake."
2,She could have done better,"The slow songs were alright, but the up beat ones didn't do it for me. I thought she would have done a better job on this one. I had high hopes and was left empty."
3,"Good, Not Great","I had HIGH EXPECTATIONS when I purchased this disc , but it isn't what I had hoped.The lame Rodney Jerkins production is boring & repetitive, and her duet with JoJo is quite lame!! I loved her recent duet with Keith Washington (I Love You) from his CD, but this duet is 'dry' to say the least.There is this wacky interlude of a child speaking-WHY Chante?? Anyway, I enjoy Easy, ..Got A Man, and I Cry To Myself.There are a few bright moments here.Check it out if you are a REAL fan!!"
2,I am so disappointed,"I am so disappointed. Chante Moore is very talented. She has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. Her 1st CD was excellent, her 2nd CD was excellent, but the 3rd Cd... What happened? The CD was trash can. I'm trying to to sell mine as soon as possible. I should have listened to it first. Because if I did, that CD would have stayed where it belongs... ON THE SHELF!!!"
4,"The best work yet,from a sadly underrated artist.","Chante Moore's voice is haunting,sweet and very very sexy. Where questionable material,and lack of promotion have hamstrung her in the past, I feel this album could be a real breakthrough work for her One of the songs that really stands out is Chante's Got a Man(a kind of answer record to Erykah Badu's ""Tyrone"").Extolling the often overlooked virtues of masculinity,and the joys of being in love with ""a good man"".This one has a shot at becoming a summer anthem, and the trademark song of her career. The only disappointment to be found here is that unfortunately she sounds like she's still pretty happy in her relationship with Kadeem. I guess for the rest of us good men the gorgeous photo on her album cover will have to be enough."
5,I thought the album was great.,"This is a beautiful album, I always like Chaunte, but it seems like she has matured more. I give this album 5 stars, because she has a positive outlook on her relationship and on others. I think alot of women and even men can learn alot from this album. Chaunte you go Girl!!!"
4,I found the CD well worth the wait and would recomend it .,The Girl is BADD. She puts her heart and soul into each and everyone of her songs. Astonishing vocal ability.
4,"Most definitely a must have, a voice from above, angelic.",I had a love affair with Chante's music from the first time I heard her sing. I give her 4 stars because I know there's more to come and you only have a 5 star rating system.
1,On the decline!,"This album was terrible! ""Chantes Got A Man"" was the only good track on the whole album. I was hoping the song she did with K.C. would be worth any thing and it wasnt. She clearly overpowered his voice and the combination was awfull let alone annoying. This hurts to write because I love her last two albums."
5,"Once Again, A Class Act","Once again, Chante Moore has put out a quality CD that distinguishes itself from her previous work and all the competition. When is she going on tour? With each successive album her style and voice matures. You can hear the growth acquired from marriage, childbirth, and losing her mother. If you are tired of the digitalized voices and want to hear some God givin', talented singing ... look no further. It is not a stretch to say that Chante Moore is the Nancy Wilson of this generation. When is she going to put out a Christmas Album?"
5,This moment is for her true fans,"This album is worth buying for a true Chante Moore fan. However, it cannot compare to the first album ""Precious"". It seems as though the album was rushed even with the right producers. Chante still has such a beautiful voice and she still proves that she has the ability to write lyrics down from her heart. Looking forward to many moore projects from Chante. I wish her much success on ""This Moment Is Mine"".Karmen"
