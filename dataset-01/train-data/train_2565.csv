4,Fantastic approach to understanding electricity,This book brought the concept of electricity to life. It made the subject easy to understand and if you can forgive the title it could go a long way in helping people who are new to the subject get a better grasp of the concept. This book would make a great introduction to the fundamentals of electricity for a young reader or a person with little background in the subject. they could then use this new found knowledge to expand their understanding.
5,Buy 10 of these books!,"I've already given two of these away as gifts and there are more lucky peoplethat will be getting them soon!This is a great book! Freeland has captured moments and emotionsthat we have all experienced and turned them into a heartwarming,funny and fabulous book that you will want to look at over and over!Great paintings, great poetry and really funny observations of life.I was laughing with every turn of the page...except for when i was saying...(...)Be the first in your circle to discover Mark Freeland...everyone will think you are so cool! :)"
4,concise and handy guide,"Buckley gives a quick coverage of what you can do or find on the Internet. He ambitiously tries to cover every major mass usage. Browsing is shown to be very easy. Several browsers are explained, notably Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Apple's Safari. But other alternatives that get a mention are Firefox, Opera, Netscape and Mozilla.Other popular activities in the book include email and using a search engine. Along with various ways to perform Instant Messaging and SMS. The very popular Skype (now part of eBay!) lets you have cheap long distance phone calls. Getting music from a peer-to-peer service is another common activity that you might need advice on.The book also warns about various perils. Like scams in email, often in the form of phishing. You are also cautioned to beware of attachments in messages from strangers. The attachments might be viruses looking for a home on your machine. So regularly updating a virus checker is a good thing.All around, a handy guide."
3,Internet Guide book,"I bought this book for a college class, but since it was not a required text, I chose to return it... Hopefully my money will be refunded!"
4,"Great intro, would love to see a 2008 update","I have recently begun a transition into Linux from Windows and found this book to be probably the best so far at explaining at an ""intelligent beginner"" level what is going on behind the scenes and how Linux actually works and is built from the ground up, rather than a ""type this in and it will work"" cookbook. My only minor quibble is that a lot has changed since 2004 and it could do with an update for 2008/09 and cover Ubuntu too, as the book is slightly Red-Hat centric. An update, if done to the same standards as the rest of the book and if it included a basic command glossary for easy reference to the commands covered in the text, would definitely merit 5 stars."
3,Mediocre shelf,"Feels pretty cheap....but then again, it was cheap. I'm not dissatisfied but it's not the best deal for furniture i've found online."
2,This is stuff you should already know!!!!,"A long, dragged out book about your ""V"". Most of the basic info contained in this book I already knew and would hope other women would as well. As far as anything out of the ordinary going on with your ""V"" go to the doctor if you think something is wrong! Waste of money."
3,"Good, but information is becoming outdated.","This book contains so much great information, especially for someone who has suffered from vulvar conditions, like myself. It covers everything from basic anatomy to vulvar cancer and everything in between. Infections, skin problems, and vulvodynia are discussed in an easy-to-understand style. However, I noticed that this book was published in 2002. In the past several years, newer treatments have been studied and used- particularly for vulvodynia. This book makes it seem like oral antidepressants and oral anticonvulsants are the only meds available for pain, but there are other treatments available. Overall though, it's a great resource for many ""V"" topics."
3,Not Useful To the average Woman,"I thought the information in this book would be useful and new, at least something new that we ladies don't get from a gynecologist visit. It certainly isn't a ""complete guide to vulvovaginal health."" I don't feel there was a thing to be learned from this book unless you're a young teenager. I recall while reading it that some subjects weren't even touched upon (was quite a while ago so I don't recall what subjects now!). I think we get about as much info on one subject as we do in pamphlets on same subjects. Perhaps it could be useful to a curious male reader, though."
5,Very complete information,This book is very complete regarding all aspects of pelvic pain related to the female body. It informs about all treatment options and is realistic. Finely found a great book for dealing with this medical issue. This book is a must for all women and their significant others who are dealing with this issue. A big Thank you to the author.
1,ouch,Real stethoscope and it works great but oh my god get better ear pieces for it. These things REALLY hurt and make the stethoscope unusable. I am still looking for good ear pieces.
5,This one really works,The older grandkids really like this one.it Looks like the real deal & they love givingNonna a checkup.
4,Quality item.,My daughters (5 and 7) loved this toy. They really thought listening to a rumbly tummy was hilarious. It picks up sounds very well for a toy!
4,Good Solid Rockabilly Sound,"If you like old fashion Rockabilly, like Rick Nelson and Buddy Holly, you will like this album. The songs rock, but the recording technique is almost but not quite up to Nashville standards. Listen to the bands tunes on U-Tube and if you like that, then this album is for you. It has most of the bands popular songs. One really nice song that is missing is an old Rick Nelson tune, ""Blue days, Black nights"". Other than that, this is much better than most other music out there."
4,"Tapco, it is what it is","It's a tapco replacement stock. If you're familiar with tapco they make solid middle of the line equipment. My 30 year old tapco stock broke, it's plastic and it tends to get old and brittle. after 30 years and I replaced it. if you want something ""nice"" look elsewhere, if you want something functional look no further. Since I already had a tapco on it I didn't need to replace and tap in the screw for the stock receiver."
5,great product!!,"this is a great product, the angle of the stock is the most comfort ive felt in a low cost stock. Before my regular stock used to rub on my cheek, now i dont have that problem. Thanks amazon, delivery was great however it took more than 5 days to recieve it but it was worth the wait."
2,Primus SUCKS. for real,"Well I tried, made it though about halfway in each song, some watched all the way. just cant touch Frog B or Oysterhead.The state of music major bummer today, Bass Players of his caliber are rare, but nope I am not going to see this show in Dec 06 when they hit my town, been twice to Primus already, I always give people 2 chances. just a bunch of noise and sounds like 3 guys that keep running into each other and falling down. no grove like Frog B and Oysterhead. But then, Les is the man in Primus, he does not have to worry/deal with other egos, he is the Alpha in Primus. Egos, feeds us all huh?Primus Sucks, for real"
4,More camera shots,"I read an interview with Les saying this was a last minute thing. Maybe that's why it isn't a high quality performance. First off, they need more camera views. Second, they go into an interlude for songs that shouldn't have one. I would prefer Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People opposed to this. But this does have some value to it."
5,correction,the person that gave this item 1 star is just jealous because he/she isnt nearly as cool as primus is and never will be so they feel they need to take there anger out on others...dont listen to him/her...there opinion is jaded.
5,primus's hallucino genetics tour,"I saw 1 venue on this tour at red rocks,morrison colorado,5 star review,a set list from god himself (les claypool) rings out fr over 3 hrs,this sureal concert tour set the bar high enough,concidering this is the 1st live dvd release from primus on their lable."
5,tom and jerry greatest chases,"Despite I'm a 38 years old person, I love this cartoon.This DVD has an excellent quality and I recommend it for you who likes a well done cartoon."
4,Great choice,"My daughter who is 4 got this DVD for christmas, she loves Tom and Jerry, we chose this one because of all the nice reviews and I have to agree with them all."
5,"O Boy, Katie and I will like these","I bought these items for 2 neighbor girls (8&16 the 16yr old is hanndicapped and enjoys cartoons) When the 8yr old saw them on her birthday, she exclaimed (O Boy, Katie and I will like these)"
3,"""The Little Orphan"" is heavily edited","This DVD would have got 5+++ stars if ""The Little Orphan"" had not been butchered. I really do not see a reason for this. Other cartoons that are included here have even more ""politically incorrect"" and ""violent"" bits. So, why they did that to ""The Little Orphan"" and left the remaining 13 cartoons intact is beyond me. They could have simply released the 13 unedited cartoons and, believe me, everyone would have appreciated this DVD much more. This injustice to the H-B masterpiece infuriates me every time I watch these toons. Because of that unacceptable, unreasonable, ridiculous flaw this DVD gets only 3 stars from me."
5,the old ones are the best,"My 5 year old twin grandsons watch most of the currest dvd's. However, nothing gives them more enjoyment than the old Tom and Jerrys. They love it!!"
3,For Disney,Pracical and safe for baby/toddler. Convenient for stroller. Power is okay.Battery compartment has a screw which will make changing the batteries inconvenient. It is a tiny screw that requires a tiny screwdriver (or maybe a pocket knife could do it.)
4,Great but Needs Improvement,"I had a HARD time finding a fan like this. I wanted it for our trip to Disney World to keep my 10 month old and four year old cool while at the parks. I believe that this is the only fan that is small enough, battery operated and safe enough that you can use with small children. It amazingly kept them cool in 100 degree weather. The manufacturer was right, the fan is built so that little fingers can't get to the blades which is what my 10 month old tried to do. One thing that would make this fan a lot better is if the neck was more flexible. It does bend to allow you to adjust the direction of the air flow but not enough. Another thing that would improve it would be if the head rotated. I might be asking for too much but as a mom, you tend to think of every possible solution that would make life easier for your child and yourself. It's a great price and pretty durable. I would recommend it."
3,Cooling down,"I do use this a lot during the warmer months, but it doesn't do a lot if your stroller is a very open type. I clip this on the shade of one of my strollers that surrounds my child more, to keep the air moving in there, and it seems to work fine for that.I do keep extra batteries and a small screwdrive in the stroller because when they start to get a little weak, the fan is useless for moving air. The safety grate keeps little fingers away from the blades very well."
4,Love the Pinwheel fan,I purchased the pinwheel fan to clip to my stroller in an attempt to cool my baby in the hot summer days. The fan is a bit too heavy to clip on the stroller and hang the way I had wanted but with a little work I was able to twist it in a way that would work. It blows enough air to keep your baby a bit cooler. I would recommend this fan!!
1,Very bad experience,"I placed an order for this product. ShopSpark charged me, sent a totaly diferent product and now they don't want to send me the right product."
5,knife,great knife. purchase three more for son in laws. a good daily carry with a lot of functionality. have been carrying this model daily for 30 years.
5,my fifth one,"The perfect knife for me. It's the first thing I put in my pocket every morning. I use it every day around the house, office and even fishing. This is my fifth one in about 25 years. I've broken them, lost them and accidentally thrown one into a lake when I was using the scissors to cut fishing line and had a big bumble bee bumble into me. When I instinctively tried to brush the bee away the knife slipped from my hand and and sailed out into 45 feet of water. The file on it works well, unlike the files even on other Victorinox pocket knives. It's big enough to do a lot of things but not to big to carry around all the time. I even like the orange peeler."
5,Best Knife I've ever owned,"I received my first Executive in 1998. It is just the right size to have useful tools without being annoyingly large. The ""orange peel"" tool is the tool I use the most. It is the best tool I've found for opening packages. It's made multiple marshmallow roasting sticks with ease.After 13 years, I temporarily lost my original executive and after I'd given up finding it again I ordered another Executive from amazon. Same knife with the same build quality arrived."
4,Best Pocket Knife,"This is the third one I've bought over last 25 years or so. Lost the previous two.Scissors larger than the cheaper model; work great for cutting fishing line, opening plastic bags, other small tasks. Nail file has machined file face which works very well. The two blades are about right. Orange peeler blade worthless except for end which can be used as small flat blade screwdriver. Tweezers occasionally useful, toothpick is worthless."
5,My favorite knife,"I've had several of this style (they seem to have several model numbers for the same configuration). I tend to lose them occasionally. I thought I had to have the usual red model, but saw the black one on Amazon for lower price and free shipping. Now I like the shiny black model as well or better than the red. Same excellent knife to carry wherever I go (except through airline check points---damn terrorists)."
5,Best deal,Best deal on the net...very short wait for delivery. Has everything you need on a knife when you want a slim line for your pocket.
5,The Swiss Army does it again,Great balance between size and function. Does almost everything from peeling an orange to tightening the screws in the front door hinge. Also works as a knife.
4,Love the Executive,"This knife has been my favorite for many years and occasionally, I will misplace or lose it. I held on the the last one for 5 years and I'm glad to see it's still being made. It's a bit larger than the standard pocket knife which I peffer"
4,I wanted black,It was nice to find the swiss army executive in black finish now it is out of production. The service was great and the knife was delivered right on time.
2,Mediocre and self-centered,"I felt that Ackerman's poems were luke-warm and self-centered. A poet must be able to find universality and find a way to plug his or herself into the greater world, but Ackerman writes blandly about her psychoanalyist with little use of figurative language and sensory details. There were moments of lovely phraseology but mostly bland ""telling and not showing."" Often I was unable to invest myself as a reader and often wished I was able to care, but Ackerman fell short of drawing me into her experience."
5,good cheap surveillance solution,"After some thefts, I purchased 2 of these cameras. Connected to a computer and combined with a capture software (free download, not part of this camera), they became a cheap motion-activated surveillance solution."
5,Great!,This was given as a holiday gift to a non-tech savvy family with their first child away from home for Christmas. They were able to set it up and each other and celebrate together. That says it all!!
4,Works fine,"Other than one blue screen of death on my laptop (none since -- likely a USB problem, and may not have anything to do with the camera itself), this camera works fine. It was reasonably priced, and has a decent image. That's all I am looking for."
4,webcam,"The product was given to my to my daughter so I can see my grandchild, who lives a long distance from me. It works very well for this purpose."
3,Image great on my Mac Pro but mic didn't work,"I bought this Logitech QuickCam Pro 5000 for my Mac Pro. It gave me an excellent image but I couldn't use the microphone. After checking with LogiTech, they confirm that this model is not supported on certain Macs, and the Mac Pro (Intel processor) is one of them."
2,Disappointed,"My experience with the QuickCamPro 5000 WebCam has been disappointing. Perhaps the problem lies with me rather than with the product. However, I have not yet been able to maintain a good ""sound"" connection between myself and my daughter (who has a less expensive version of the Quick Cam). When I do have a reasonable connection, there is a significant delay between the sound and the video. Also, the video, though not all bad, is somewhat distorted. When I tried to install the program on my son's computer (which is somewhat faster than mine), we weren't able to do so. As already noted, the problem may be with me rather than the QuickCam. However, after many tries, my disappointment remains."
1,Problems with 3rd Party Instant Messaging Programmes,"Regrettably, I would not recommend this cam if you want it for Instant Messaging.I could not get it to work on my rather old Dell PC, so tried it on a modern, hi-spec IBM T42. While I can see an image on the Cam's QuickCam feature, and it is recognised by Live Messenger, I cannot get an image to be sent to the person to whom I wish to chat.A search on the Logitech Forums, revealed many, very unhelpful messages and tips in respect of this problem. The upshot seems to be that it is only supported to use with Logitech's Video Calling software (monthly fee) and not with 3rd Party programmes like Live Messenger. A pity, as that's why I bought it.I cannot find any solution on the MS Messenger Forums, or anywhere else, and I'm pretty Computer savvy, so it's just going to gather dust, as it's hardly worth my shipping it back, having shipped it out of the US and paid import duty and taxes on it where I live."
2,Logitech Knowingly Releases Bad Product,"How does a major company release a flagship product that is entirely incompatible with Windows XP.... the operating system on the VAST majority of computers in the world?? good question and one that Logitech can't answer. If you run windows XP be prepared to have major crashes and lockups with this camera. I managed to get it running with thier latest ""10.0"" drivers from thier website but it's only stable as a USB 1 device....if I wanted a slideshow cam I would have paid 20 bucks Logitech. All that said I believe it it a good product if you can get it to run...sooo up to you. I would not reccomend it until Logitech has proven they can support it...lame-os."
2,Good if you like your system to randomly restart,"I believe this is the second Logitech camera that my computer didn't like. I was running an older computer and the system would restart randomly so I just assumed it was time to get a new computer. So I got a new HP system with all the bells and whistles and I bought a new webcam (Pro 5000) to go with it. When I'm running any video software on the computer it randomly restarts. I would not recomend purchasing any logitech cameras. The face tracking is a good idea, and I like the zoom feature. but overall wouldn't recommmend this product to anyone."
1,Buyer Beware,"My experience with the Logitech QuickCam Pro 5000 WebCam was not a good one.When loaded on my Toshiba laptop, the QuickCam Pro 5000 software caused all of my audio files (Windows Media, iTunes, CDs, and e-mail ""You've Got Mail"") to sound like ""The Chimpmunks.""After spending one hour on the phone with Logitech support and Toshiba support, I gave up, removed the Logitech software from my system, and returned the entire package to the store.Frankly, it shouldn't be that big of deal to get a major vendor's Web cam product to run on a new Toshiba Qosimio media system running XP, configured with new drivers and 2 gigabytes of memory. My advice: proceed with caution."
4,"Great webcam, poor software","The cam itself looks very sleek and advanced. As for the quality, flawless. The only con it has would be the software and the drivers. On my computer it seems that the drivers have some compatibility issues with windows xp. The cam cannot be plugged in before you start the computer or else the computer will restart itself due to a serious error from the drivers installed. Other than that, great cam."
1,The product description appears to be misleading,"The product i received doesn't include a headset. A replacement didn't include it either. I still don't know if amazon is mixing up the 2 models of Pro 5000 (w/ and w/o a headset) in shipping, or if the product description is simply wrong for the model they are selling."
3,Camera Works Well but some of software does not.,"CameraAssistant,exe does not function.Launcher.exe does not function.but I can receive a video call from another person. The call is perfect!"
2,LOGITECH QUICKCAM PRO 5000,"I DON`T KNOW HOW TO RATE THIS DEVICE BECAUSE I HAVEN`T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT YET. IN OTHER WORDS I CAN`T USE IT,BECAUSE THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ON HOW TO INSTALL IT AND NOT ON HOW TO OPERATE IT.AOL DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THE FILE IS TOO BIG FOR IT.I HAVE ASKED OTHERS BUT DON`T GET A CLEAR ANSWER,BUT I WILL FIGURE IT OUT AND AFTER I DO I WILL GIVE A RATING ON IT.I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE FRIENDS RECOMMENDED IT.EGL"
4,good,It is a good webcam better than Pro 4000 which I had bought earlier. The images are sharper than the previous version. The only problem is it gets struck while chating even when we use high speed internet. Good for indoor recording along with PC or notebook.
4,Clear picture & easy install,This camera works great and from our PC it interfaces with both PCs and MACs. It's easy to install and the picture is clear. Great value for the price. Our grandchildren are all over the country and now we can see them while we talk with them.
5,Great Webcam,Smooth operation with some of the best video i have ever seen from webcams. None of my higher priced recent webcams match this quality. I have to use this version on military supported computers and I have gotten only great comments back from those webcamming with on my quality of video. You wont regret this purchase.
1,Unable to Install - poor Web Site Experience,"Purchased this web cam as an update. Have had and used many web cams. It works well on the Mac but on the PC I can not get the INF file to initialize. Worst part is the very cryptic support web site (after spending 30 minutes carefully providing the problem along with screen shots, the Web site invalidates due to a faulty Phone number format (3 times until I simply gave up).Lastly, the drive CD was so warped it would not read (or spin)requiring me to download the drivers.I have used many web cams and have had no problems - now this one is in the rubbish bin as I now purchase a different make. Fool me once, shame on you."
2,"Great image quality, but stop working after just 2 weeks","Excelent image quality, great microfon but it worked for only 2 weeks. After that the system and the program don't see a pluged camera anymore."
4,Logitech QuickCam is a good deal for the price,"This webcam is a fun piece of equipment to have. I use it to ""visit"" with my daughters. I bought one for each of us. The picture is still a little jerky at times, but the technology has certainly improved for 4 or 5 years ago, when we got our first webcams."
5,Seeing and talking to friends on the web.,This webcam works great with Yahoo Messanger and has all the features of cams twice is price. It was very easy to set up. Most of the time I spent on set up was trying to disable all the firewalls. Getting it to clamp onto laptops and thin monitors is a little difficult. We finally folded a wash cloth to tighten the fit so it didn't slide around.It has a built in microphone so you don't really need the headphones.
2,Bad usb,This camera works if you do not mind replugging the USB in every time you use it. I have contacted Logitech and have not gotten a response. I would not recommend this camera. Also it does not come with the headphones as stated in the description I contacted Amazon about this and changed the camera and received the same. After second try they gave me a discount on the product. Look for a different camera this one not worth the hassle.
2,Doesn't seem to work in all Motherboards,"I got this camera with great hopes, but it produces a blue screen of death when plugged in to my new ECS motherboard. It works in my Asus board (but like the previous poster said, the software CD that came with it was buggy).Maybe Logitech will wourk out the driver issues soon, but for now it's DOA on some boards."
1,Non Compatible with XP,"Followed the enclosed instructions for installation and updated the software. All worked fine, except for the sound, there was none. Upon restarting the computer, I experienced the worst crash with XP ever. All programs would shut down and send an error message. Luckily after the 3rd computer restart I was able to access the system restore program and restore to an earlier time. Everything is fine now, except that the camera is disconnected and awaiting for a bug fix. Searched the internet and found out my problem was very common. I sincerely hope LOGITECH fixes the bug since the camera seemed to have a very clear picture for the 2 minutes that it worked. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA UNTIL THE FIX IS AVAILABLE....."
5,excellent video quality,"I've used this webcam with 3 different people so far, and they all report good image quality. One person said that, when the video is viewed full screen, the picture quality is almost as good as a standard definition TV. From my perspective, I could only judge the picture quality of the other parties, and they were pretty poor, probably because they used cheap webcams that were a few years old.I have used 2 different instant messaging software, MSN and Skype 2.0 beta. While the picture qualities were similar, Skype had significantly better frame rate, and hence motion was not as jerky. However, neither system even came close to 30 frames/sec.One tip I have is that if your room is dark or you have strong backlighting, you should switch on the low light setting in the software."
4,good image,"Good image quality. average sound. you may expiriance a problem to install software and then device itself from CD, which has older version of the installation software. Fortunately there is a latest version of installation package on Logitech support website. I was looking primarily for image quality and I'm quite satisfied."
2,Beware of incompatibility issues,"Image wise, this cam is probably the best in the market, period . However, Logitech needs to solve some incompatibility issues with windows xp. After installing the Quickcam 5000 my computer would only boot up to a black screen. A quick web search found many others around the globe having the same problems. Apparently it has to do with some audio features of the cam, nonetheless I had to go back to my old cam until Logitech comes up with a decent solution. Some people seem to have had a smooth ride though, so try at your own risk."
1,Install Problems,"Camera looks great, but crashes system every time I plug in to USB port. I am running Windows XP SP 2 on a 2.4 GHz P4 with 1 GB memory so there should be no system issues. I downloaded the updated software from Logitech and this didn't fix the problem. I plan on returning the camera.Also, according to the support email I got back from Logitech, which was no help, ""The Logitech video cameras are compatible with the USB 2.0 specification, but not compliant. This means the Logitech camera will function properly when plugged into a USB 2.0 port, but the webcam feature will function with the USB 1.1 specifications. The biggest difference between the two USB specifications is speed. So the webcam will work and have full functionality, but it will run at the maximum 12Mbits/sec speed of the USB 1.1 specification."""
5,Excellent Web Cam,"Excellent picture and sound quality. Very easy setup.Great features.I bought two of these when my in-laws moved out of state (one for us and one for them). It has been an Awesome way for them to keep in touch, especially for my 2 yr old son who really enjoys talking/seeing them via the webcam.Highly Recommend!"
5,Nice camera,"Great web cam. Nice echo cancellation. Works good even in low light. I got one, then my brother and sister got one. Then my dad. All have the same camera, all working great."
1,Not working with Vista,"I tried all types of chat software that provide audio and video, but could not get both working at the same time. If the audio worked the video did not and visa versa. i am very frustrated with this web cam, i would not recommend this. If anyone know a solution please let me know..."
5,Excellent for video chat,It was easy to set up and I'm really impressed with its audio quality. I use it for video phone calls to Korea and the sound quality is much better than the real phone. Video quality is acceptable. I'm sure it's not the camera but the Internet connection that makes the video not so smooth. It's still great to see each other and chat! Highly recommended.
5,Does exactly what it says it can. Excellent product!,I love the built in color correction technology and the bult-in mic. Setup took less than 5 minutes.
4,Great,It's great. I like the tracking system. It's good for the value (especially when I get $20 back.
1,Illogitech,"This is the worst camera that I have ever purchased. I had a Logitech before and so went with the brand name. From the getgo I had problems. First the software wouldn't load properly. After that, the camera continuously malfunctioned causing loads of computer problems. After five days, I realized that I had to return the product to Amazon. I have since bought another webcam and it works beautifully proving that it wasn't my computer or incompatibility issues, but a defective product."
4,It is really good,This camera is really good. I cannot say it is amazing. But works well in both my laptop and desktop. I never tried in Fast internet connection. But still it is worth to buy (Price is little high)I will recommend this to friends.
4,Pleased,"The Logitech was easy to install and use. I purchased two. This product was recommended to me by a friend who only purchases the best in technology. So if it's good enough for him then it's good enough for me and it helps that the price is reasonable. I'm happy with my purchase. I gave a 4 star instead of 5 because i think the clarity can be improved, however, for the price i am not complaining."
2,Camera maybe nice but drivers cause blue screen,"I can't install this camera on 2 of my 5 computers, even with the help of their tech support. Installing the driver blue screens on both of my laptops (Dell and Toshiba). On the computer it does install on, it won't install on my USB 2.0, only on the 1.1Even though the camera is installed on a slower usb port, the face tracking actually works and is nice, but aside from that one feature, my cheaper (1/2 price) Logitech webcam is every bit as good and a works on all my computers without issue."
2,Buyer Beware,"This is my 2nd one. After buying it I found out it would not work with Windows 7 64bit Operating system. When you put in the CD the first thing that comes up is a sign ""Invalid Operating System"" or something like that.It will work on Windows XP and Vista, but not on Windows 7 64bit.I wish I had known this before buying it.Thanks for reading...."
3,They need to fix the software!!,"The webcam worked GREAT! An exception to that, the software messed up both of my computers! I read all those reviews about the problems with the software, i thought by now Logitech notice the problem and fixed it, pssh i was wrong. I dont think this is just my problem, i think a lot of people also have the same problem as me."
2,great picture...not so great sound,"I bought this camera for my husband who is stationed in Afganistan. The picture is very clear and we enjoy being able to see eachother. However, the sound is very unclear...difficult to understand. Most of the time we leave the sound off. My web cam is a creative and it has a mike that is separate from the camera. We definitely prefer my mike, he says that the sound is clear and reliable. Maybe this webcam works better in a more secluded environment? Not impressed."
3,Becareful,This is a wonderful product with one exception. The software has some conflicts with other programs that deal with photos such as Adobe photoshop and other commercial photo programs. It causes problems with Adobe Acrobat too. If you buy only download the drivers and not the software. The software is only needed if you are going to take pictures with the web cam. Use a digital would be my recommendation
2,A Disappointment,"I've used numerous webcams over the years, and for the money spent, I was disappointed with the Logitech Quickcam Pro 5000. The picture quality was marginal..very blurry/soft focus. If the cam was located a great distance from the subject, the image was acceptable, but bring it in closer or zoom it in, and all the faces went blurry."
5,"Nice camera, a bit pricy and overkill just for videochats","I had used camera for about 4 months. Works fine, but if you need camera just for video chats get something simpler and cheaper than this one which overloaded with features that are not useful."
1,Won't work with Vista,"Had a cheaper model of Logitech on my Vista computer, and had a Microsoft Webcam on it. Both worked fine. This one, couldn't get a picture to come up, no matter what I tried. Kept telling me the camera was not connected or not working properly. If you have Vista, get a cheapie camera. You might have a bad picture, but bad is better than none. Logitech had no support at all."
3,Beware the Blue Screen of Death,"After correctly installing the software on my 2006 Dell laptop running WIN XP Pro, plugging in the camera immediately generated the Blue Screen of Death.Enough said."
2,Disappointment,"No instructions came with this model. It should have been easy, but it was frustrating for the 7-year-old and the parents. There was also a very misleading and confusing inclusion of a screwdriver (for what, remained a mystery)."
2,False advertised size.,Description states 1/48 scale. That would make this model ~7 1/2 feet tall.No other mention of size. Appears to be a few inches tall.
3,Listen to the music!,"Forget the zany story line (I prefer Smoke Signals) but listen to Madredeus, a truly phenomenal group and the incredible Teresa Salgueiro whose voice is like none other. She will come back to haunt you - and the record Ainda is marvellous. The movie is Winders at his less than best"
4,amazing world geography ; a book of answers for kids,"My grandkids loved the book, they can read it one chapter at the time, great for car rides as they can ask each other questions from the book. I would recommend The New York Public Library Amazing World Geography; A Book of Answers for kids/"
2,Not so effective,I have used wrinkle decrease day and night cream regularly for 1 month. but didnt find any noticeable change.
4,Great product,This is a great product. I would recommend it to anyone I know who uses products like this. Really I would.
4,...With A Twist!,"This is Bob James' third trio release. It features him with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade. Starting off, we get an unusual re-working of one of Bob's classic tunes, ""Night Crawler"" (originally on HEADS). ""Ambrosia"" is a perky tune which in one section reminds one of Michel Legrand's ""Little Boy Lost"". ""James"" is his treatment of Pat Metheny's tribute to James Taylor. ""The Jody Grind"" is a danceable tune by Horace Silver, featuring an unusual solo from Bob. Next comes a broody standard ""Lost April"". Bob's enigmatic ""Three Mice Blind"" with it's scary intro is my personal favorite. ""Hockney"" is a funky number, possibly in tribute to the artist of that name. ""Shooting Stars"" is a slow-swinging tune. We close with Bob's version of the Denny Zeitlin classic, ""Quiet Now"". STRAIGHT UP is a masterful effort from one of jazz's great keyboars masters!"
5,If you think you can't machine quilt a large quilt,"Think again. With the methods in this book you divide your quilt into parts, quilt the smaller parts and put the quilt together. It takes much of the strain and tension out of machine quilting large quilts."
4,Useful information,"I was more comfortable with Machine Quilting in Sections, but this book also had useful information to help me quilt a king sized quilt."
2,not what i expected,I had seen this book on a TV program. I thought it would tell me a lot more about quilting.
1,Don't understand the positive reviews,"After pondering which litter box to purchase I decided on this one. There were so many positive reviews that I figured it was worth the extra money. It wasn't.First - the lid is awful to put on and take off. It isn't easy and honestly it's a royal pain. The lid is terribly awkward to take off and getting it to line up right to put it back on is a joke.Second - odor control. What odor control? I may as well have my cat use an open box because there is NO odor control at all.Third - this is not the fault of the litter box itself but the plant was missing a piece.Fourth - scattered litter. Sure this happens with lots of litter boxes but it seems worst with this one.This litter box is going back. I have already purchased a $25 box for my furry friend and it works perfectly. It's compact but large enough for multiple cats, keeps the litter in the box and the odor under control.Save yourself the headache."
1,missing parts,i ordered this item for my pet cat. i am currently deployed in the military and my gf said when she recieved it she only got the bottom half of the litter box. Not the plant part!!
3,Keeps it hidden but...,"The box looks good. I have not had the issues that people have mentioned about not being able to get the lid back on easily. For me, it lines up every time without a hitch. However, it is a pain to clean. The bottom is not flat so when you're doing a full litter change it's impossible to just scrape everything out. If the bottom was flat it would be much better."
5,Love this!,"I moved into a smaller apartment and didn't want an old ugly litterbox hanging out in my living space and mucking it up. This is a wonderful solution to that problem. You can't tell it is not a planter, especially with other plants sitting around it to help it ""blend in"". The cats love it, it is big and round, plenty of room for my 16lb cat to do his business in. Both of my cats now prefer this box to their other box which is upstairs. It is a little tricky to get the top back on after scooping, but it only takes a few concentrated seconds to get it right, and I'm sure it will get even easier with time and repeated scooping. Very happy and will buy again if ever needed."
3,Hidden litter - not exactly,"I do like the way it looks - not utilitarian. However, how does one hide the liner? I use the jumbo elasticated liners & I can't figure out how to hide the white plastic! Still, it does look way better than the usual litter box. I also thought it would contain the odor more, but that does not seem to be the case. I guess scooping out twice a day is still the answer!"
5,Awesome!,"I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't have a space to hide their litter box, like me. I have had it sitting in my living room against the wall for 2 years and NO ONE has ever even known it was a little box. When I tell them that it is, they always say I had no idea"" Its great and my cat doesn't even care that it isn't a typical litter box. He still uses it regularly."
2,looks good but is not functional,"Product looks good, but is very hard to get the top and the bottom to match up and not have the top fall into the bottom portion. Also I use cat litter liners which I have yet to find any that fit the actual bowl, either way too small or too big. The only way to use it as pictured is to not use a liner and wash it every time. I would probably go with something a little less hassle next time."
5,Awesome Cat Bathroom!,"WOW! My cat loves this thing! I wasn't sure since it looks funny... but it sure works! I had to move my litter box into the living room (Small Condo) and of course no one wants to see a cat going potty! The fake plant on top is definitely FAKE! but hey! She likes it, my guests don't know it's there and everyone is happy!"
3,It's OK,"It's a little big and bulky and not as inconspicuous as one would like. The plastic plant on top is a lot cheaper looking than the one in the photo. We actually replaced ours. We have a disabled cat who has trouble getting into it, but for most cats, it's not a problem."
5,The coolest litter box,"I know its pricey, but I have 2 cats and the pan itself is large enough for the 2 of them, and not to mention it looks like a fake plant. A bad fake plant, but o well! I think its awesome!"
5,Looks real watch price,"I put this in the corner of my living room by the couch and the end of our upstairs hallway. I was surprised at good it looked. Like the other reviews not cheap looking at all. I had NO PROBLEMS putting the top on the bottom. And I may put some extra branches in it but it looks fine for now. My friends ask me ""Did you get a new plant"" and laugh when I tell them what it is. Watch the price on this one as it fluctuates. You can usually get it for 50% off"
1,WAY Overpriced,Do not buy this item. It is way overpriced. It's a great concept but it's flimsy and cheap and not worth the $71.95 you're going to pay for the item including S & H.
4,Awesome purchase,"Just refurbished the master bath and the old fashioned litter box just wouldn't do. Found this product and decided to try it. Awesome - no one even notices that it is a litter box. Although you won't find it in the product description, the unit comes with a charcoal filter right below the plant. One drawback is that it is a little difficult to handle when changing the litter. I'm guessing after a few more cleanings I'll have the process down."
3,Doesn't look real,"Size is good but plastic is thin and doesn't look real, not enough texture. Plant doesn't look real, not enough branches. It will go ok on a porch but not inside house. Directions incorrect, filter around base of plant should go first before plant. I will buy a real looking spider plant stalk to go with this to look better. Also should be more colors to choose from."
3,Not worth the investment,I ended up returning this item. The pot was a very thin plastic and looked cheap. The plant bottom surprisingly was bigger in circumference than I thought. I live in a one bedroom apartment and was hoping to purchase something that was stylish and functional. I felt the piece drew more attention to the fact that it was a fake plant holder disguised as a litter box.
4,really cool!!,"This litter box is so cool because now I can put it anywhere, I don't have to hide it! It is big around, which is great because I have three cats. The plant part is cheesy looking, but what are ya gonna do, right?"
1,"Good idea, poor design","I recently received this item, and it is being sent right back as a return because I (and my husband) find the lid impossible to line up and stay on- 99% of the time we try to put the lid back on the tray, it falls into the litter. It is not designed in a way that functions very well, particularly as the lid has to come off twice a day to clean it."
5,Plasticky but way better than a 'real' litter box!,"Okay - nobody is going to be fooled that you have a lovely potted plant in your room - it's definitely a plasitic plant in a plastic pot. That said - I got this for my folks for their lanai and it's quite nice! I sure is better then the litter box under the chair ;-) The added bonus is that they can rotate the opening around to the back and you get two advantages - you don't see the litter box opening and even better - the opening is now protected from wind, rain and weather, as it's a lanai in Florida - she likes that too!"
4,roomy and inviting,"love the idea and love the product. My cats don't like some of the boxes with doorways, but none of the have a problem with this one. the flowers sent with the box are untenable so i shopped and bought smaller ones."
4,"Good purchase, we would recommend","It's exactly what I thought it was going to be. It won't blow your socks off, but it gets the job done and allows the owner to have a litter box in a room that may not normally have one. The tree came flattened, and you have to work it back into looking like a plant (even then....it's not that impressive). The top sits on pretty easily and my cat used it within a few hours. She liked it more without litter in it even! But the enclosed case does welcome a kitty who likes smaller, dark areas. She still managed to kick litter out (something I think she thinks is hilarious - typical cat humor) and you'd need a pad under this to keep litter from being tracked a few feet from the box. Easy to scoop out of without lifting the top off. Not really big enough for more than 1 cat in my opinion.Overall, a good purchase that we are happy with."
2,great idea - bad product,"This is a great idea but a bad product. I would love this item if it were not so cheaply made. The quality does not match the price. The material is very flimsy. If the bottom of the container were heavier plastic it would work much better. When scooping out the litter clumps , if you push hard on the side it tends to bend. The thin plastic is also the reason the top is a bit of a pain to put back on. The silk palm is a little chintzy. I added some more silk greenery to mine and it looks much fuller and nicer. If the quality were better I would have order two more. For the quality of this one I dont think I should have paid more $35."
4,Good looking easy to clean litter box,"I am very pleased with the Hidden Cat Litter Box. If you have to have a litter box out in the open, this one really blends into the furnishings and doesn't look like your regular litter box. It is easy to clean, the only thing that has been a problem is that my cat likes to pull the moss, which is around the plant on top, out and drag it around. I could always replace them with something else like larger stones they make for flower pots etc. Because the box is enclosed, with just one opening, it also limits my cats getting litter all over when she scratches around in the box. Overall, I'm glad I bought it and will keep it as long as it lasts."
2,looks nothing like the picture,"This thing is totally ghetto and cheap. Kitty Bear is a slender 7-8 lbs, and when he turns around inside it, he always knocks the top part off. It isn't very sturdy at all. When it starts to topple, Kitty Bear gets scared and runs. There have been a couple instances where he ran out before his dingleberries completely dropped. Good thing I keep this thing in the laundry room, which has a tiled floor.The fake plant is totally lame. I know a lot of people say to replace it, but seriously, why even include a plant that cheap?Lastly, this thing is a serious pain in the butt to clean. This thing gets nasty unless you use liners, but then that makes this become an obvious cat box, defeating the whole purpose of having it in the first place! It's now in my house with no top at all. Total waste of money.I guess it does it's main job though, which is holding cat litter and waste. 2 stars."
5,Hidden cat box,This cat box is great! Didn't have anywhere I could keep the liter box without it standing out! When I saw this I had to have it. It is actually bigger than you think it would be but I love it and so does my kitten! I would definetly recommend this cat box.
4,Great idea!,"I love this product with one exception. The plant is not of good quality and looks fake. The ""pot"" itself is a great idea and looks real. My cats had no trouble with the transition from their old litter box to this one."
5,Love it!,"Well, we love this litter box. Since we moved last year, we no longer had a place in the house to sequester the litter boxes, so we had to turn to trying to get them out of sight in other ways. This litter box has now replaced one of the regular boxes we'd been using for years. We are keeping this in a corner with the entrance/exit somewhat turned toward the wall, and pretty much everyone who has come by the house has mistaken it for a real pot and plant, which is exactly what we were hoping for.The price for this seems to fluctuate, and we managed to snag it for about $70 on Amazon.. Still a bit high for any litter box, but it was worth it to be able to not have an unsightly litter box out in then open now that we don't really have anywhere to hide them."
4,Love it,I received shipment on time and I do love it. I have a very large cat and he does fit in the box. Hole little small and size of pan is also small. But all in all it's great!
3,It's okay,"This litter box is less of an eye sore than the traditional kind, but it's way overpriced for the quality. But, it's a good size, and my cats use it regularly. The top is a bit tricky to put on, and the plant certainly doesn't look real, but I didn't expect it to. A hidden litter box is a great idea, but I'm hoping for a better invention down the road."
4,decorative yet purposeful.,This was perfect to conceal a litter box and yet decorate a space. I have 2 cats.My cats went right in and made it their own.
4,For those interested in WWII,"The author brings home to those of us who have never experienced war, what it was like when the Nazis invaded Paris and the French countryside. A fictionalized account of the events that challenged both the French and the Germans."
4,A challenge to entice me to resurrect my French,"My church book club has this on the list for later this year. A friend and I have challenged each other to read it in French. She is retired and is sticking with French only plus dictionary. I have less time,as a working editor, so I am ""cheating"" by also having at hand the English translation.I find myself so engrossed in the story, that sometimes I almost forget I am zipping along in another language. If I get stuck, I then find myself forging on in English and forgetting to go back to my linguistic challenge of French from DECADES ago! Mademoiselle Briand would be so proud!Riveting book in whichever language. Makes one want to start a journal/diary right away, though not to live through such harrowing times. So glad someone else put this on the list!Heather BanksMaryland"
1,"My copy was in French, not a translation","I wish I could read French, But a couple of quarters of college french did not help that much. I never sow anywhere that stated that this book was not a translation."
2,Forced to buy this book for class.,The book came to me in good condition. That is the best thing I can say about it.
5,Detractors need to look at their own assumptions,"The comments here so far from the people who didn't like this book say that Healy is biased because she starts out with too many negative assumptions about computers. But what about the assumptions that technology advocates are making? There are incredible assumptions being made about the potential of educational technology, but there's not much evidence to support those assumptions. In fact, there's a lot of evidence that suggests educational technology is just a craze and a boondoggle. I found Healy's argument--supported by studies, expert comments, and her own extensive school visits--to be both balanced and convincing."
5,One of the best books on the subject I've ever read.,"Failure to Connect is an excellent and extremely well written account of the potential dangers (and benefits) of using computers for teaching and for entertainment. Dr. Healy points out that there are a number of physical and developmental factors that we don't know enough about to entrust children to ""cyber-development"" -- and there's a lot of evidence showing the necessity for the presence of caring adults and physical learning environments in order for children to develop good thinking, motor, and social skills. The book's tone is never ""anti-computer"", but it is always ""pro-human."""
2,Unreliable. Frustrating to use,"I bought this and put it to use on an 8 mile run 4 days after it arrived. It catches on to the satellite but have constant trouble hanging on to the signal as I run. As a result the readings on the T3 fades in and out. It is a very frustrating experience. I had thought of using this to compare against the foot pod, however T3 only allows the use of one (either the foot pod or GPS pod) at a time. Though the foot pod requires frequent calibration it is atleast consistent. I returned the product. I have read better reviews about Garmin. Garmin can cost 3 times as much. At this point, however I am willing to pay extra to get better reliability."
2,Unreliable GPS,I purchaced the Suunto T4 and added the GPS to track speed and distance. My wife uses the Garmin 205 and the GPS reception on the Garmin is far superior. Suunto GPS takes along time to initially find a satellite. Once you have a signal it drops it throughout your run. I run in a rural area and still have bad reception. I used the garmin 205 for a couple years and it had very reliable reception. I am considering the foot pod due to the GPS problems.
2,"Good Paper, Bad Shipping","The paper in and of itself is just fine. But Amazon didn't package it properly for shipment -- they used some tape to try to hold the paper box's lid down rather than securely fastening the lid to the box. All of the reams of paper were opened and some were damaged. From other reviews of Amazon's paper shipments, this seems to be standard practice. Be warned!"
1,Do Not Buy,"Terrible packaging. The box it came in looked completely beaten up. When I opened the lid, I noticed all the paper wrapping for each and every ream of paper was in tatters. The actual paper were dirty on the sides and the corners on many sheets were folded down. I will never buy paper from amazon again and you shouldn't either."
4,Poorly wrapped but good paper,"We bought this primarily for use in a Brother color laser printer. It works fine for that purpose.We were disappointed to find that when it arrived, more than half of the wrapping on individual reams was seriously torn, compromising the protection of the paper from absorbing water from the air. It is too soon to say whether this will be a problem."
1,Water Damaged,Just opened paper after having received it two and a half months ago. Much of the paper inside is damaged though the box appears to be fine. Would have selected returns but my two month window has expired. I now have $40 worth of water damaged paper and can do nothing but recycle it. Bummer!
2,Poor Quality Book,"As soon as I got this book and opened it up, the pages began to rip. It was put together very poorly. Alghough, it does contain a very good amount of information in it. Whoever the company is that put it together though did a very poor job, because after reading through it for about a week, most of the pages had come apart from it."
2,It leaks,"Works ok, hard for it not to! But if you listen, and not all that closely, you can hear hisssssss."
3,Multiple sing-alongs decapitate show,"I love these folks . I love these songs . I love Diana LIVE IN PARIS . I ""hate"" sing along concerts . By anyone . There comes a (lengthy) point in this show where it seems Diana just wanted to sit this one out . The concert never recovers . I'm astonished she released this particular date . If you like sing along concerts (augmented by brilliant jazz musicians) , this IS for you . Good luck with that . The dismay by her fellow musicians is palpable and discernible . It happens . Don't peddle it though ."
4,"Worth buying, fans","Big fan of ""Live in Paris"" and her many CDs, though I wasn't knocked out by ""Girl in The Other Room,"" ... but that's just me. Very appealing performance on this DVD and if you're a fan, buy with confidence. Besides, if you've got Jeff Hamilton and John Clayton on a stage playing anything, you're hearing top-shelf players. Beautiful video of Rio and the Bonus Feature conversations are interesting and enjoyable. Money well spent."
3,My feeling about this blu-ray,"The show it's very good and very emotive.The video quality in some scenes lack the quality Blu-ray promise, but the overall quality it's very good.The extras are very complete.I recommend it!!"
4,Much better than Quiet Nights,"This DVD offers a good concert featuring the D. Krall Quartet (plus a Brazilian orchestra for some songs), they are just great. The DVD is much better than her recent Quiet Nights CD. It is a pitty that Mrs. Kralls does not play the piano that much and the group has a stronger basis on Anthoy Wilson's great work at the guitar. Hamilton and Coleman are their own regular gery good musicians. I recommend the DVD."
3,It's OK,"I love the photography and the sound is great, but for some reason I think Diana sounds out of tune in several songs. Don't take my word for it, go to youtube and check that for yourself. Anyway, for the price I paid it was worth it to buy this blue-ray DVD."
5,Diana Krall (DVD) Blu-ray ~ Diana Krall live in Rio,"If you like lite jazz, piano or bosa nova you need to hear this. I wish Diana Krall had more Blu Ray video's available. The only thing I didn't like about this is many of the audience shots are grainy. I don't know if it was because they were shot in low light with an High def camera or if they were shot with a non HD camera. That's my only complaint, other than that Diana and the rest of the band and orchestra give a great performance. Really nice to come home and turn down the lights, turn on the fire place and relax with that special someone that appreciates good mood music."
3,Great show. Poor image quality.,The show is really great. But the quality of the image during the stage could be better to be released in BD.
4,Amazing music,"This DVD is not quite as compelling as Live in Paris. It is not as romantic, nor is the orchestra as incredible. However, it is still a wonderful concert and well worth the money."
4,"I liked it, different than ""Live in Paris""","As has been said, more laid back than ""Live in Paris"". Musically the arrangements for drum and base were better, in my opinion. The video production was definitely not as good. The extended drum solos had JH sweating a few times. JC had some very good solos on the base as well. Cool as ever. The piano, guitar and percussion were not as exciting as in ""Live in Paris"" and I prefer the song selection of ""Live in Paris"". Diana seemed a lot more relaxed and chatty in Rio. Overall a good buy for Diana fans but if you must choose between them, by all means buy ""Live in Paris"". Heading to London to see them at the RAH in Oct so it should be interesting how the tour compares 3 years after Rio was filmed."
3,Not MY Diana,"This is the first time I've written a review, but I just don't agree with the other reviews here.I am a huge Diana Krall fan or perhaps I should say was a huge fan, because after buying both Quiet Nights and Live in Rio, I'm starting to reexamine my position.I have all her early CD's as well as Live in Paris, which I've watched at least 50 times. I should state that I don't care for her newer CD's, but her rendition of the American Songbook songs are superb.However, Live in Rio was a disappointment. Though it used the same artists as Live in Paris, it lacked the energy and creativity of Live in Paris, and I expected to see the passion of the environment that spawned the Bossa Nova rythms that seemed to imbue her earlier work.Finally, the quality of the lighting and camera work was not even in the same league as Live in Paris. The Blue Ray (which I purchased) was much worse than the standard DVD of Live in Paris.In summary, nice but not the Diana I came to love. Uninspired!!!"
3,diana krall still a strong performer after having a family,I was concerned after all the attention given to her marriage to elvis costello and having children that the music might become secondary. this is an intimate performance in Rio but a little sleepy. also too much audience sing along although done in portugese is interesting.
2,Her first failure,"This is a dissapointment on all fronts. Her voice seems tired and unsteady and even her performance of the standards does not measure up to her earlier work. As someone who has all of her previously released material and has seen her perform live in large and small venues multiple times, I must say I hope the ""real Diana Krall"" returns soon!"
1,Total disappointment!!!,"Whoever shot and produced this material should be fired. Whoever approved the release of this material should be fired. Hard to believe Diana Krall herself would have approved it. Withouth even talking about the overall performance itself, the video quality of this Blu-ray is the poorest I've seen in recent concert releases, considering the quality of HD technology available today. Diana owes it upon herself and fans to demand a properly edited, post-processed re-issue of this Blu-ray material. No amount of high-end consumer HD component could improve the video and audio quality of this release. You have to see and hear it to believe what I'm saying. However, this is an excellent reference material for today's film making students HOW NOT TO shoot and post-pro in HD, highly recommended."
2,Good but not bluray quality,"This is my first review ever. I too am a Diana Krall fan. I also have the Paris DVD and have watched in countless times. I have mixed feelings on this one however. I like the music but the quality of the image leaves a lot to be desired. It's bordering with the quality of a pirated DVD. The image is grainy in places, the lighting is not good etc. The sound is acceptable, not great, just acceptable. Would I buy it again? Possibly, but just a DVD, spending more for blueray is a waste of money. When I purchase a bluray disc I expect superb quality. It`s just not there."
1,Play it before you invite anyone over,"Myself and 3 others are huge DK fans so we decided to watch the Rio DVD last nite. They came over, we filled our glasses with adult beverages and sat down with anticipation. I inserted the DVD and guess what-every damm song on that DVD was scratched. It wasn't the DVD player, other discs played fine.Both the Joni Mitchell CD and this DVD I ordered were scratched which begs the question- where is Amazon's quality control?"
2,D.Krall DVD,"I purchased this Live in Rio by D. Krall and I can't see it continuosly well, as well as Live in Paris, I have been very disappointed because I love Diana Krall."
3,A bit disappointing,"The Huichol art is so colorful that I was disappointed to find this book to be in black and white, and more like a textbook. I bought it for my Mom after having traveled to Mexico together. I actually returned it. I found some children's books that had beautiful illustrations in the yarn painting style."
1,Don't bother wasting your time,"I do not know whether British society finds it acceptable to invite relative strangers up to their apartment and offer them cocaine after a brief encounter, but I found it a bit strange. Even if the book did not go into odd behaviors like S & M, fetishes and drugs, it was very predictible and boring. I did not find it erotic, just odd and boring. A definite ""Skip It."""
2,Yet another Bridget clone. . .,"While Lauren Henderson is a technically good writer, I couldn't really get into this book. It just seems like she was trying too hard to be edgy instead of actually being edgy. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's posing and posturing. Basically, if you strip away the coke use and the S&M; clubs from the book, this is just another Bridget Jones book. Oh, and the main character is a publicist. How typical.Two stars for the book not being sloppily written."
1,Hollow and Choppy,"I am an avid fan of reading, and I have never stopped reading a book right in the middle, but this book was horrible. I barely made it to the middle when I got frustrated and stopped reading it. The plot is so very choppy and there are no details to the relationship between Annie and the Prince. I can't even remember the name of the other characters--that's how bad it was! I am sorry, but do not waste your time; you should move on to another book."
2,STORY NEVER BROUGHT TO LIFE---,"This was a surface-skimming story that lacked any depth, mainly because very little info was given and what was given was fragmented and extremely predictable. There was little for the reader to become emotionally attached to. The heroine had been in love with the hero since her childhood fascination, but there was absolutely no reason given for the hero's returned love. Made for a very flat story that felt quite off the mark."
4,The Perfect Bra,"There are endless choices out there for comfortable, supportive bras. So, why have I consistently stuck with this specific bra? It's simple. I know that Wacoal is a company I can trust. The product is packaged neatly and delivery is always on time, or even early. I love this particular bra because it is cool, comfortable and has a minimum of extra/heavy material you sometimes find. The snap in the front is one of my favorite parts and is so much more convenient than the typical style. If you are buying this bra, I would just warn you that the straps tend to be long, easily remedied by a few stitches by each shoulder. Good luck in your search! In my opinion, it stops here. :)"
3,Not true to size,"This is a really nice top, but it isn't true to size. Order a size or two larger than you are used to."
5,Rio Vaquero,This an excellent movie Robert Taylor plays a great part along with Ava Gardnerand Anthony Quinn again plenty of action well written story if you enjoy westernsthis one i would recommend well worth purchasing sit down and enjoy.
3,Very misleading cover art...,"Okay this is the first review I have done so dunno where to start. The obvious if you like the cover art and think it might be a more r rated Avatar, don't buy this movie. There are no blue girls or waterfalls like in the cover art. But it does have one remarkable and savior in it's mist. One of the leaders on this planet is played by Flower. She is beautiful and reminds me a little of Grace Park from Battlestar Galactica, but is no means as beautiful as Grace. Her scenes are a little disappointing because there wasn't enough skin. The movie itself really has no plot and the acting is quite horrendous and the sex scenes are barely r rated at all. I would save your money for something better."
1,Crap,This movie was crap it was so edited that it could have been mistaken for a childrens movie I wish that I never bought it.
2,Amber Saved it,"Well . . .Lemme see it wasn't horrible the sex scenes and do not have enough life in them it is as though actors are bored, although the opening sex scene with Amber Newman saved it all, the only reason I watch the film over and over and over again, I gave it a whole star just for that scene"
4,Dog collar,It was delivered in record time. Unfortunately the collar closure snap would not stay closed and when my 16 pound puppy pulled on the leash it came undone. I notified seller and she was very apologetic and said that she would send another one straight away. Lettering on the collar is very nice.
2,Embroidered Personalized Dog Nylon Collar.,Looks great. Embroidery is nice. But doesn't stay fastened when dog on leash. Pulls apart with any pressure. Not as good as previous one I purchased.
3,Poser 7 - A little better then Poser 6,"Well here we are with the next Poser version. I just can't help to think why didnt e-frontier just make a PRO version for 6? Poser 7 adds better memory handling and finally takes advantage of duel processors and hyperthreading, but at this stage, I'd think Poser 6 should have done that already. The new supplied characters are lackluster next to the Daz family of characters, but they do offer a great variance for any crowd images and background characters you want to render. I just still can't help but feel that Poser 6 should have had the new base features already in it, or that Poser 7 should be a bigger leap forward. - if you're a die hard poser user, then by all means take the step up, but if your satisfied with Poser 6, then step back and just watch. I personally have gotten a huge gain from the duel core usage, but if you're on a single processor, you would not see much if any gain from it."
4,Poser 7,"After using this product for a couple of weeks I am happy enough with it. I am actually looking to create my own 3d projects from my drawings and this program is for posing premade objects. Basically this is a dress up doll program, which can be fun and useful. I like the program and it works really great for what it is and once I can create my own objects, I will use them with Poser. There are a lot of objects to buy and get for free to play around with. I'm not unhappy I bought it."
2,Just Pinch Me...I MEAN IT!,This book was so incredibly cute it made my hair rise. Somebody please kill anybody remotely similiar to these characters in real life
5,Then Ruby Knight by David Eddings,"This is the first book that I've ever read by David Eddings, and it definitely will not be the last. I haven't ever wanted to read anything since I first started learning to read when I was about 4 or 5, but I'm fourteen now and I love this book! I'm just your average fourteen-year-old too. Not some little bookworm. Anyway, enough about me, about this book. These are what I found to be strong-points:Huge cast of important characters.Each character is uniquely different [that may have been a reduntant statement(uniquely different), but work with me!]The author, David Eddings, introduces character traits all throughout the novel.Lots of suspense and mystery.Anyway, I'm in class right now so I guess I'll go now before the bell rings. Believe me, there's so much more that I haven't mentioned. So, all-in-all, a great book! I can't wait to read more books by David Eddings."
1,Oh please....,Oh please...let me show real credibility with the summary of an event... Great hero in disguise manages to get one on one meeting with religious leader of millions by declaring that he is brother to important king. No documentation is produced to prove this. Religious leader then changes policy based on a message made up on the spur of the moment by great hero. Once again no documentation is produced.What a joke.Read something else.
5,All of these are delightful!,"These are all wonderful books to read as and for a child. Everyone has a bet of Ramona in them and we all have conflicts between our other family members like the young girl. Beezus can be related to anyone who has had to live with a teenager and when we read the whacky stories about Ramona's parents we all say inside, ""Hey, That's like my mom!"". The mouse and the motorcycle are very delightful, too. We never thought a bond could strike up between a small mouse and a child but this story proves us wrong! I strongly reccomend these books."
3,Misleading description,"I should have read the review that says this does not fit the Creative Zen before I ordered it. It will only fit very slender MP3 players, not the credit card sized ones."
2,Incorrect dimensions,"It wasn't the size I expected, and therefore didn't fit the requirements I needed. The quality was okay, but just not big enough."
3,Wrong item,Found this item and bought it when searched on Creative Zen M. It didn't fit and didn't say it wouldnt when purchased. I have returned
1,Fabrication and Fiction,"After reading Manny Garcia's Book, I find it riddled with false information and the degrading of many fine and valorous soldiers that served in B Company 2/502nd Infantry 101st Airborne Division. I was a Platoon Leader in the 3rd Platoon and I have been in contact with many members who were there at the same time as his time period. So far not one member remembers him or his supposed exploits. There never was a combat jump on a NVA Hospital, pure fiction, He was not a graduate of the Ranger School (Can be verified thru the Freedom of Information Act), the list can go on and on. It is a shame that the University of New Mexico Press would print a book without checking it's authenticity. I'm sure many others members of this unit will also write reviews."
2,Not. Opeth. Whatsoever.,"You'd think a band that plagarizes Opeth song titles as flagrantly as April Ethereal would sound a bit like Opeth. Instead, it sounds like they asked someone what Opeth sounded like, but the person telling them was on a bad cell phone in the middle of a parade, and after they finished writing down what the dude said, they put it into Google Translate a few times before turning it back into English, then blew off some firecrackers in their ears (thus making it difficult to hear) right before they decided to try to write some Opeth songs.Complete failure.I bet the CD is okay if you don't know who Opeth is, but I'm so upset they weren't an Opeth clone that I refuse to listen to this again."
2,Lazy Book,"Goldstone is a skillful lawyer and a dedicated human rights activist. He played a central role in South Africa's transition to democracy and in the purusit of justice in the former Yugoslavia. He has a sharp eye for bureaucratic absurdity (especially in the UN). He knows world leaders and could have written a fascinating ""inside"" history. Instead, he produced this short, lightweight book comprised of little more than anecdotes and name-dropping. It's incredible that Yale University Press saw fit to publish it. We can only hope that Goldstone will turn to writing a serious autobiography after he steps down from the South African Constitutional Court."
2,Don't waste your time,"Crisp is a decent storyteller, but he is helplessly blinded by ideology. In his alternate universe, the Soviet Union is technologically superior to the West, which is inevitably headed for economic disaster. Oil is in such short supply there is rationing in Europe, with most people unable to afford any at all. NATO has placed their nuclear weapons under computer control, without human intervention.Supposedly his computer consultant son assured him of the feasibility of certain elements of the story. But given the discussions of the computer, its programming, and its virtual infallibility, they obviously did not understand computers, even though this was published in 1982.I got this book for free, so it was mildly amusing to read a Soviet apologist's fictional account of a nuclear crisis. Thank God (and Ronald Reagan) that history turned out much differently. Read Tom Clancy instead."
3,Interesting look into underworld of drug dealing,"Plot: Your above average weed dealers, who are used to dealing by the dozens of pounds each week get into a jam. You find out who your friends are really quick when you owe the people who fronted you the weed a lot of money. Simple pushers take it up a notch as it gets more violent and they turn to the coke trade to recoup the money faster. Interesting turn at the end.The acting is by far not the greatest, keep in mind this is a low budget indy film."
3,No comparison,"I think the movie ""Blow"" was better which had somewhat the same message as this one. This movie is OK."
2,Cord holder,"I'm not impressed with this product at all, it is soft rubber and doesn't hold my cords at all. I'm glad I only spent a few buck on it and shipping."
3,Clumsy Gadget,"This gadget can be used to store a set of earbuds for the iPhone or iPod, but it's rather clumsy and awkward to use."
3,Just so so,"It does let you wrap the cords up, but for me it wasn't worth it, since it weighs the cords down a bit. It looks a little weird hanging on me. It also does come unwrapped from time to time. I ended up undoing it and letting the cords hang down under my shirt."
3,Not all I had hoped for.,"Thankfully the product is inexpensive enough that the disappointment isn't too great. The mainproblem with this product is the flimsiness of the ""notches"" at the ends. A great idea poorlyexecuted.I was able to make the product usable by wrapping the headphone cable (once it was wrapped on the device) with dual-sided hook-and-loop (Velcro) tape. The sort used in securing wiring and cablesin the IT field. Overall, I give it a C- to C grade with a ""needs work""."
3,CORD FALLS OUT TOO EASILY,The problem with this product is that plastic is too soft and the cord falls out too easily. But I bought another cord organizer and the plastic is so hard that it's hard to get the cord in and out of the hole!
3,Not what I expected,I wa impressed at how fast this item was shipped if came really fast. The item itself is not what I was hoping for. It does not allow me to wrap my earbud cord securely. It is small but OK if you dont want to wrap your cords for storage in your bag or pocket.Overall its not what I wanted and I ended up purchasing another product.
3,"Good idea, could work better","This is handy to keep a cord in line, but it doesn't hold it in very tightly. I find that the cord slips out easily. But its still neater than having the cords unwound and tangled."
5,Lexar CF Cards,"I've used Lexar CF cards for 10 years, and they've functioned flawlessly. They're tough, durable, easy to use and the value (storage space) for the dollar is incredible. Ten years ago I paid almost $200 for a 1GB card. Now I'm getting 4 times the space for 25% of the cost. . . bgs.."
5,amazing,"I purchased this card a few weeks ago. I'm amazed by it's performance. I use it on my Nikon d2x ad i works perfectly. Knowing that in the near future I will uy the new d3, I bought this card with the nre UDMA technology. I haven't seen yet it's performance regarding to it's speed, but I cant tell that as for now it's faster than the previous cards I bought. Lexar is very reliable. I have other lexar cards bought a few uears ago, and never had a problem with them. As soon as I use it on the new nikon d3, Ill update this review."
1,No software,This product does not come with the software listed in the description. There is a URL to a website where you can download a free copy of the ImageRescue3 software. There is NO reference to Paint Shop Pro software.
2,Dissapointed,"The card does not meet the advertised 45MB/s write speed. I am only getting 23MB/s read and 20MB/s sequential write. Purchased with a CF to IDE adapter intending to use as a solid state drive in a laptop, however due to technical reasons this brand is not suitable as a boot drive unless you modify the Windows driver. Lexar tech support was not very helpful, stated they do not support use as a fixed drive in a computer.Pricey! I guess it would be decent for use in a camera, but my tests show there are better/faster 300x cards out there for less money."
5,unique and clear,"This is the only good vegetarian Japanese cookbook I have found. The author is a British woman who lived and worked in Japan for several years, and developed vegetarian recipes with the Japanese women she lived with. She is creative and successful in the way she modifies traditional Japanese recipes to fit into a vegetarian lifestyle. She incorporates personal stories and Japanese history into her recipes, making this book fascinating as well as useful!"
1,An Appalling Read,"This is only the second Ray Garton novel I have read, although, I only got through a fraction of this book before it all became too much. The graphic detail of what happened to the young victims in this story was completely unnecessary, the storyline was horrifying enough, and would have been good without all the disgusting details. I would be ashamed to have my name appear on a book like that. Some horror novels and thrillers are sometimes made more terrifying without specific and graphic details, especially details of this nature, this was just overkill to an extreme. Like I said I have only read one Ray Garton novel from start to finish and I think that will be the last. I personally would not recommend a book like this, it was sickening."
2,Creepy,"Creepy, and not in a good way. The crimes perpetrated in this book are just sick, and there's too much info about the crimes themselves. Child molestation + kidnapping + satanism = too creepy."
1,seriously flawed,"I was so happy with this machine the first two times I used it. The third time was a disaster. The milk foamer did not work. I have tried everything, but it still does not work. Any suggestions?"
5,Employee Christmas Gift,The leopard duck and devil duck were given to employees at the annual Christmas Party. They were jokingly requested for in a test tank in our manufacturing plant. Great moral booster!
2,nicer ones out there,"These ""Americana"" wine charms don't measure up to the real thing! They lack the quality, clean look (too many beads) and ease of use (tiny hole to clasp) of other similar products. I've been collecting That Wine Is Mine wine charms for a few years now and found their ""Freedom"" patriotic set have a much nicer collection of charms (with both silver and gold) than this one. Amazon's other wine charms are from That Wine Is Mine which makes a quality and original product. Go figure!"
3,"Excellent Scope,","The scope is excellent but the pictures are disappointing (much smaller optics). Even in good, bright sunlight the pictures are grainy (640 x 480) and dim. I haven't used it enought to rate the batteries (two pictures was enough for me to tell that I wasn't going to bother with the camera any more). Both the hard and soft case are quality items and are nice to have. The tripod is well constructed and has fine adjustment knobs for zeroing in on your target. This item would definately be a 5 if it wasn't for the crummy camera."
3,Tuff got toughened up for this record,"Released in 1995, ""Religious Fix"" was Tuff's second full-length album. Considering the lack of success of their debut, these guys had really nothing to lose by toughening up their sound a bit.The first notion I want to dispel is, this is not a grunge record at all. This album simply follows the melodic rock formula and adds a little heavier guitars to the mix. I'll be brutally honest though, I have never been the biggest of Tuff's fans, they just seemed a little less talented than other bands of the day. I'm not chopping these dudes or anything, they just weren't that great. With that being said, there are still some solid tracks on this album. My favorites are ""Daddy's Money"", ""Tied To The Bells"", ""In Dogs We Trust"" and the cover of Tennessee Ernie Ford's ""Sixteen Tons"".I say give this record a shot. You may find more on here than I did, I just wouldn't pay a lot for it."
5,Great Little Knife For The Price,"I really enjoy carrying this knife around. It's small, compact, and light. The knife weights very little because of the cut outs and design of the blade and handle. For an every day knife you can't beat this for the price. No complaints here."
1,not particularly interesting,"There's some pretty writing in spots here, but there's really nothing much to be said. I love Indian lit, but this one adds nothing new. You finish the book and wonder why you spent the time reading it. Arranged marriages suck, women struggle for freedom, men are not particularly enlightened. A bit repetitive, like something I've already read a dozen times, no new or interesting settings, or characters, just some nice turns of phrases. Not recommended."
2,a mix of lovely and quite dull,"It's hard to know how to rate a book like this -- it's a mix of two parts lovely writing to two parts dull as dryng paint. When Moharaj write about sex or cooking, she's spot on; when she writes about other emotions and parts of life, it reads somewhat forced and phony, and you just want to skip pages, rapidly. It's also impossible to track on the characters, which makes it impossible to care what happens to them. The best writing here I'd read before, in the erotica zine cleansheets.com and other erotica books, though the stories seem less sexy in this book. I guess it's another example of a writer straying from what they do best in hopes of commercial success. I can't really recommend the book, it's mostly too dull, but it's probably worth a scan in a bookstore for the good parts."
1,Style over substance,"I was very disappointed by this book. It promises poetic writing and great sensuality, and both items seemed to be missing in my copy! ""Pretty"" writing at some points, but no depth, which seems a requirement in order to be truly poetic. There wasn't a character I'd care to follow to the end of the page, never mind to the end of a book full of mish-mashed stories. There's probaly a good and interesting tale about Sri Lanka/immigration in here somewhere to be told, but it seems that the author doesn't have the skill to bring that story out and make it hold the reader's interest."
4,A good introduction,"This book was a lovely and sensual introduction to immigrant fiction. As a white American who's immigrants are far removed from her life, this book was an eye-opener for me. I loved learning about the culture of Sri Lankan in this fashion, as well as gaining a greater understanding of what immigrants in today's world face.The stories in this book draw you in. The different characters see different facets of each other. One of the things I loved was seeing a previous viewpont character from a different point of view, by a father or mother, child or lover. The different faces we all wear are described my Mohanraj very well and with ease.These are the stories of life and love, sex and death, laughter and tears, trust and betrayal and most of all: humanity. Each of the varied stories through the years and families offers something different to be treasured. And you can almost smell the curries wafting up from the pages."
5,Must read for new writers,"Condrill's book was fantastic at helping me come up with creative ideas on how to promote my book, Genesis Beach, and how to get folks to host book signings at practically no cost to me. I am still overwhelmed and grateful for the success I'm having. I wouldn't have had a clue without this book."
5,We ARE stron enough to THRIVE from trials . . .,"This is a truly inspirational and uplifting book. Personal essays of people who have had serious challenges and/or trials in life, how they survived, and what they learned. I highly recommend this for anyone who is currently going through really hard times, or anyone who has survived them. You discover you are not alone in your stuggles, and that the adage is true: ""Anything that does not kill you makes you stronger."""
3,Please be advised...,"Please be advised that this book is written by Mormons for Mormons. All quotes are from The Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith. Christians who believe in the Trinity and do not subscribe to the LDS belief system should be aware that although the testimonies are heartfelt and the stories sincere, there are no Scriptures from the original Bible text found without some kind of mind twist to confuse even mature believers."
2,wrong product,"ordered this product. looked like what i needed, but it didn't work with my device. I don't know how you would know if it would work or not before you purchase. seems like it should be a simple, universal product."
5,I enjoyed this book very much,I enjoyed this book very much. Interesting read. The only thing negative I could say about it would be that the synopsis section on the 1225 episodes was typewritten so small I could not read it. I used a magnifying glass to read it but still was very hard to read.
4,"Enjoyable, fun read","I found the book enjoyable, especially the David Hennessy interview. He was candid, humorous and insightful into the people he worked with as a child. It would be nice for him to write a book expanding more on his memories + what it was like to be a child actor in NYC in the 60s-70s. It would also be a fun movie idea if you ask me. . .from his perspective, working on this crazy show with actors who 'lived' the life. Observing all the craziness of the fans, the hysteria. . .I would like to see a future DS book catalogue more of the crazy stories we've heard over the years. This one was a rehash of earlier Memories books and the attempts to explain the DS storylines (convoluted as it was).R Jamison"
3,Good but not the best DS book ever,"A little inferior to the DS Almanac 2000 that came out last year in terms of info. Not as much in this book. There are mistakes also (like in DS Almanac 2000). On page 3 Kathryn Leigh Scott claims her first words ever on Dark Shadows were ""You're a jerk.."". Actually in the first Dark Shadows ep Scott ever appeared in she first said ""Roast beef rare and coffee right"". Then she said ""You are also a jerk""."
3,So long...so interesting!,At first I looked at the book and said wow so long! But as I read it was so interesting! I really got into the book and the characters. Some events and ideas were a bit far fetched for me but overall a good book. I look forward to meeting Ms. McCreary at our book club meeting this Saturday.
5,Great documentary but what's the deal?,"Has anyone noticed that the times given for each ""Inning"" (i.e., disc) on the DVD is wildly inaccurate? Am I missing material or what? Almost every inning is under two hours according to my DVD player but the case usually indicates a time of 145 to 155 minutes or more. Are there hidden easter eggs on the disc or is PBS just wrong?jr"
4,Baseball: The American Game,"I never was a fan of baseball. But after buying and watching this series, the history of the game hooked me. I started out with the VHS version. But was pleased when it was released on DVD. Ken Burns did a great job with this series. However, all 9 of the disc's in the set I bought have skips in them. But for those interested in the history and drama of the National Pastime, this series cannot be beat....."
5,Excellent Product,"I purchased a video set ""Baseball: a fILM BY by Ken Burns"" (by PBS) and it was like new. It consisted of 10 disks all in perfect condition and I viewed them all over a 10-day period, without any problems. I received the set in a box and it only took about a week. I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,Ken Burn's Baseball,The best doc ever! Ken Burns hits a glad slam with this one! His very best work in a long line of many great works!
5,Sublime Documentary,"From the beginnings of baseball to the modern era, Ken Burns covers the topic with archival graphics and outstanding narrative. This may be the very best documentary (or 9 documentaries) ever made, and that includes Planet Earth and the efforts of Errol Morris. Even if one is not particularly a baseball fan, Burns clearly shows the metaphor that baseball is for American life. Each of the discs is about 2 hours long and thoroughly entertaining in itself. The plight of the ""Negro Leagues,"" the early history of baseball, the amazing, record-setting feats of individual players and the effect of baseball on American life (and America on baseball) is so well presented that this series sets a standard to which other documentaries - of any topic - must be compared. While I was not much taken by Burns' Jazz series, this series is just the opposite: engrossing, superbly presented and historically accurate. At the price offered, it is a sheer entertainment bargain!"
4,Well-Done.,"I've always been impressed with this series, though the last two episodes were disappointments, by comparison. I always thought the ending of the series should have gone back and covered all the greats - one more time. There should have been a better nod given to some players just before they passed, too - like they gave for Ruth and Robinson. Still, this is worth the time for a real baseball fan."
2,Finally You Just Stop Watching,"Unlike the Civil War, baseball is just not interesting enough to support the huge amount of time this series soaks up. Eventually, unless you are a true believer, you just give up watching. My wife and I did about half way through."
2,Burn's Biased Baseball History,"Ken Burns does a brilliant job of covering the history of baseball teams from the New York area (including the Dodgers and Giants) and the Yankees - Red Sox rivalry while ignoring most other major league teams. He augments his slanted history with interviews of baseball writers and sundry celebrities almost all of whom are Yankee or Red Sox fans. This documentary does maintain a properly reverential attitude toward our national pastime throughout but his focus on his favorite teams is hard to stomach. The first thee ""innings"" covering early baseball are the best."
4,Poor Sound Editting,For some reason the producers let the standard Ken Burns wondering piano notes play over top of the spoken words in places. One would think this would be caught before it got out. Very frustrating and a disappointment in an otherwise fantastik piece of American history.
1,Product is being returned.,The product arrived in good order but was unplayable as it was NTSC (not Pal) format and the wrong region for Australia.
5,fantastic,a git for a friend and sportsmanhe will enjoy them while recovering from an injuryhe and the documentary are very special
5,Best documentary ever,"If you love history, or documentaries, but especially if you love baseball you simly must watch this series. It is right up there with KB's Jazz and Civil war documentaries."
5,Awesome,"Great series for any true fan of the sport of baseball. Gave this to my husband for his birthday, and he really loves it."
3,Beware of frequent interuptions on DVD version,"This documentary - in its original form - is nothing short of magic. Poetry. While I am happy that I purchased this dvd set, I am very frustrated by the frequent interuptions to the narrative. Sometimes mid-sentence, breaks have been intentionally added in order to provide the viewer with the opportunity to ""press the select button"" to see the players stats as ""extras"" of the dvd. Keep in mind, there is no way to go back and get the ends of the sentences - they're simply not there. These interuptions completely disrupt the flow of the narration and leave the viewer feeling like their missing out. If you prefer the ""extras"" that the dvd has to offer including player stats, scene selection, etc., you will enjoy this set. However, if you want to experience this beautiful documentary in the form that Ken Burns had originally intended - buy the VHS version. You will NOT be disappointed."
2,A Biased Lefty Program,"I saw portions of Burns' Baseball on Major League Cable/TV on and off Christmas Day, including the Jackie Robinson segment, which was well done (as a kid, I'd seen him play at Ebbets Field: Yes, I'm a New Yorker!). But I also caught some of Barry Bonds complaining about the tough treatment he received from fans in Alabama (is that the best he could do?)...and then there was Bill Lee, who showed up wearing a ""CCCP"" cap (as in Central Committee of the Communist Party!). Why would he do that, and (worse), why would Burns film him that way? Since we're in year four of the Marxist dictatorship of Zippy Obama, and all he intends for our once-great republic, Burns' having taken essentially the same in-your-face lefty stance did not sit well."
4,For anyone who loves Baseball!!,"I wasn't interested in Ken Burns', the Civil War until just recently. However, I was interested in viewing this film from the begining as I'm a huge fan of the American pastime. I absolutely enjoyed the interview with Buck O'Neill as he tells his adventures with Satchel Paige as well as Bob Costas' observations of the 1986 World Series. What I didn't like was the interviews with historians as I was baffled on their, so called, baseball knowledge. What worked in the ""Civil War"", didn't work with this film. As with his other documentary, this film will inspire those who love the game and those who would like to know more about the history."
3,Ken Burns' Baseball,Fine production using narration and graphics. I found the music and audio narration quality to be annoying in some segments; primarily because music and narration poorly mixed... music is loud enough to smother the narration. Most offensive was piano overwhelming the speaker.
5,Good Gift,Wonderful gift for the baseball fanatic. Had more footage than the VHS series - so it was a reasonable upgrade.
5,"Sappy, corny, pretentious, sentimental, INCREDIBLE.","No other sports documentary is quite like Ken Burns' BASEBALL. It's way more than a twenty-something hour long history of that strangest and most glorious of games--far more. It's an voyage of emotion that takes the viewer through all the inconceivable highs and unfathomable lows that baseball can and does bring all of us who are touched by it, and even those who aren't. If you ever thought the Great Game was boring, tedious, or pretentious, watch this film and discover that...you are absolutely right. And that's why baseball rocks."
2,"In three words...boring, boring and boring.","I've got love for no other sport but baseball (and hockey) but I'm sorry this documentary is at its very core a boring treatise into political correctness. Burns takes a fascinating topic and instead of going into the dugouts and into the locker rooms, gives us a ten thousand foot view of the stadium while reading a newspaper. The over-concentration on the Negro League tells me this filmmaker has an agenda. He takes this game and boils it down into purely political terms which made me nauceous.The pace is maddening if not monotonous and there is so much about the actual playing of the game and its memorable moments that are relegated to nothingness that the entire series just seems contrived. I think I'll stick with the Joe Garogiola version of baseball because this one is flat out a borefest."
3,Don't be mislead,"This is a fine film about baseball in America. However, do not be mislead, at its heart this is a film about race relations in America. The negro leagues and the integration of baseball are really at the center of the film."
3,Typical Ken Documentary: S-L-O-W,"As with his other documentaries, Ken Burns the hero-worshipper makes sure we get the point: His heroes are heroic, the topic is profoundly revealing of America and Americans, and we deserve to spend about 30% more time than really needed to dwell on the topic. This IS a wonderfully complete photographic record of the game; I just wish Ken Burns could edit as well as he assembles. The collection's strengths are countered by its bulk, the painfully slow pacing, and the unnecessary and manipulative soundtrack. If you watch it a second or third time (and I have), you'll want to have one of those VCRs that enable you to speed it up by increments, or be bored to death."
5,Mom is very happy!,"I got this set for my Mother, she loves baseball and had been talking about wanting this DVD set for a long time. But the price always stopped her. I saw this and the price was great and I knew this year, she was going to love at least one gift I got her, lol. Her face lit up when she opened the package and she even put in the first disk before we were finished opening gifts. So far, the disks she has watched have had no problems, and they were shipped really fast after I ordered them. Thanks for making a lady really happy :)"
4,Baseball,"Purchased for a gift so have not watched it but based on the reviews, package details and photos am really pleased with purchase and would highly recommend it for baseball fans."
3,Great if you are a Yankee or Dodger Fan,"I liked ""Baseball"" except I've got to agree with other's who claim that the content centers heavily on just a couple teams like the Yankee's or Dodger's."
5,Worth Every Penny,"I can't improve on the myriad positive reviews already here. I can only say that with ""Baseball"" Ken Burns has created a chronicle of our ""national pastime"" that achieves the feat of being both informative and entertaining to hard core and casual fans alike. Truly a ""must have"" for any baseball fan in the family."
5,"Even if you hate Baseball, you'll love this documentary","I am not a baseball fan. I have never watched a baseball game on TV. I don't care who gets into the world series. A friend sat me down, and made me watch the first episode, and I was hooked. This is a wonderful, engrossing history of America's favorite pasttime. I cheered when Jackie Robinson was hired to play in the white leagues, I laughed at many of the anecdotes. This is just a great show, and watching it, you learn as much about America and Americans through the past hundered years, as you do about baseball."
3,Too much Patriotism!,"The films are good, but they have a large part of bad hollywood patriotism in it which we could've done without! US Flags are all over the place and the anthem plays practically all the time when looking at it. There should be updates coming every 2yrs or something with more updated knowledge and videoclips of recent history.Baseball 4ever /vince"
1,Ever Heard of Denny McLain???????????,Who is the only pitcher since 1934 to win 30 gaems? WOW -- it's Denny McLain!!! And he could quite possibly be the last to EVER do it. REMARKABLE FEAT!!! Do you think Ken Burns even mentioned this in his documentary? NO!! How can there be NO metion what so ever about Denny's amazing accomplishment? Ken Burns get you head out of your *** and WAKE UP!!!!!!
1,I'll be returning this - Production error on disc one,"I was thrilled about seeing this series on DVD, complete with the Tenth Inning episode. However, there appears to be a disc mastering error on Disc One. The picture goes blank and then re-appears several time in the opening minutes. I don't know if the other discs have this problem. Someone needs to issue a recall!!!"
5,Wonderful!,This is a great DVD set. We watch it each year and thoroughly enjoy it learning something new each time.
4,"Baseball please, not plinky music","The set is a great history of baseball. But Ken Burns is too in love with period music, especially played on guitar and piano. Interviewees are saying something we want to hear, but it's drowned out by slide guitar and endless repetitions of the national anthem and ""Take Me Out To The Ballgame."" Too often you have to struggle to understand what's being said. This is Burns' style, which is why I debated buying this set and don't own (or watch) other Burns documentaries."
3,I think this book should have been Last,"My personal opinion this book should have been that last in series ...it has some repeated information i.e High Availabilty, High Protection architectures.. Ch8 : Failover Clustering being introduced first time in this book should have been give more pages and info. Some body who has done all practise in First book ( implementation and maintenance ..) don't need know or redo Mirroring, replication etc. Anyway the book has some important aspect in the first seven chapters which cannot be missed and being a simple DBA is not enough ..one need to know how the infrastructre go about..."
3,"Helpful, but","Helen does a wonderful job of preparing you for surgery. She has good information, related in a conversational style. There are even a few pictures to prepare the reader for what you will look like immediately after surgery. But personally, I wish she had been more thorough in describing what to expect after surgery. Her ""after"" pictures stopped at day six. I would have liked to see what to expect on week 2 and 3. Those weeks are handled with a brief paragraph each. With so much attention to detail leading up to surgery, I would have expected just as much detail afterwards. Otherwise, good book and worthwhile reading."
2,Mostly puff piece - some good tips in last half of book.,"Written like an adolescent's homework, this book is totally unprofressional and superficial to the subject. The author suggests checking out a surgeon's office wallpaper, objets d'art and magazines to evaluate ""who he is"". Tips on homeopathic approach to presurgery care is noteworthy - otherwise a disappointing read."
4,a very good behind the scenes look at cosmetic surgery.,"As a professional in the Cosmetic Surgery industry I felt this book was an accurate portrayal of what a patient goes through before, during and after surgery. This book is written in layman's terms and is a light, enjoyable read with enough depth to enable a consumer to make an informed decision."
5,SO FUNNY!! WE ALL LAUGHED. FUN TO READ!!,"WE BORROWED THIS BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY. THE FIRST OF WABERS BOOKS. I READ IT TO MY 8, 5, AND 4 YEAR OLD. WE ALL LAUGHED AND LAUGHED. FUN TO READ!! I IMMEDIATLY ORDERED TWO, ONE FOR US AND ONE FOR MY NEICES! IT WAS REFRESHING TO READ A CHILDS BOOK THAT EVERYONE ENJOYS. SO MANY BOOKS AND SO FEW GREAT ONES. IT WILL BECOME A FAVORITE IN OUR PERSONAL LIBRARY."
5,You'll have as much fun as your child!,"A marvelous turn of phrase and a very simple concept make this a sure hit with any 3,4 or five year old I know. There is some rhyming and a lot of repetition and a fun concept that the young ones can grasp from the very first visitor that Bearsie Bear gets. The hardest part of reading the book is keeping a straight enough face to finish the page - BIG Smiles and lot's of laughs."
4,Depends on who's reading...,"My daughter is 2 years old and we've had this book two days. She listens very intently as I read it. The story has just the right amount of repetition to reel her in and allow her to ""catch on"". I'm sure this will be a book which she requests often.So, why only four stars? It really is monotonous for a parent who reads books to their children often. Parents who find themselves drained by the end of repetitive books should simply not introduce this one until the child can read on his/her own.To sum it up...this book is captivating, humorous, and easy to read if you are 2 - 5 years old. Above that, you may find yourself feeling guilty about hiding it."
2,Not a fan,"I must admit, while my daughter might like to read it once and a while, I am not a fan of this book. In fact, I cringe a little when it is chosen. The story is cute, however the repetition of both the situation and the names of the animals in the story are painful...Foxie Fox, Cowsie Cow ... come on!! If the book was a must read favorite every night, it might get a different rating."
5,"Will the Electronic make history? Yes, maybe.","What you are reading in almost all the reviews about this CD by Electronic (and the previous one as well) is true. It sounds like shallow music of the late eighties, with no-brainer lyrics. Yet, this is the first impression. The sound is intentionally anachronistic. Songs are very carefully structured. This group side-steps the current trends in electronic music (e.g. Massive Attack) and calls for a ""return to order"". It doesn't take itself too seriously, and by doing so is more serious and advanced of many want-to be artists and manipulative DJs. This is an interesting piece of work, doing with 80's music what Nyman is doing with Purcell's opera: rework; repetition; metabolization of a peculiar sound. The result is a pleasant, mesmerizing, new music. Congratulations."
4,Bernard who??,"Back in 1980 there was a brilliant guitarist named Johnny Marr. Therestill is (check out Mighty Mouse). Acclaimed as the jingle jangle manbehind Morrissey's whining vocals in the Smiths, Mr. Marr is a forceto be reckoned with.Then in 1996 there was someone called Bernard Sumner. Who? In a bandnamed Electronic. Ummm..well sounds like New Order to me, with a sliceof Kraftwerk added for ambience.(It is well worth the effort to dancearound your kitchen to Electronic on your boombox.)This album just grows on you. Therefore, multiple plays are requiredto dull your senses with the hypnotic rhythms of Johnny Marr and hisbacking band.Please browse all of Electronics' music today without hesitation."
3,Pet Shop Boys clone group deserves a good listen,"I almost jettisoned this CD from my collection because I was looking for electronica/new age which the group name implies. However, as another reviewer says, the initial listen may not impress with simplistic, awkward lyrics, but their music quickly grows on you and reveals a depth not apparent at first. Very similar style to Pet Shop Boys to whom Electronic have ties. One of their tracks is even closely modeled after a Pet Shop Boys hit."
1,Is really Johnny Marr playing in this album?,"When I bought this album I was hoping for some Johnny Marr guitar, yes, maybe with some electronic stuff, but still JM is JM! Only,this has nothing to do with his guitar, you can't even hear the sound of his guitar. I mean, I was not expecting The Smiths, but at least some of Marr's musical invention. Sorry, but this is not my cup of tea!! Buy it only if you like New Order or other electronic bands, don't buy it if you like the Smiths."
5,best of the best,"One of the best album from Electronic! Very melodic and sensible. Track ""Second Nature"" blowing up my head. :-)"
4,Holds Up Well,"I bought this CD shortly after it came out (to virtually no fanfare here in the United States), having bought the first Electronic CD because I am a fan of both The Smiths and New Order. I listened to it today for the first time in about a year and it really holds up well. If you like New Order you should definitely get this CD (or any of the Electronic CD's for that matter). The disc has more in common with New Order than The Smiths. I disagree with the reviewer below that Johnny Marr is MIA on this disc, however. My only personal complaint with this CD is the fact that the first 8 songs are clearly the best on the CD and once you get past them, the CD drags a little. But its still a great CD and if you like it, the other Electronic CD's are very good as well."
3,"Good, Not Great","This CD isn't half as good as the debut album, but it's still a very good disc, most of the time. Until The End Of Time is a great song, but the disc is brought down by songs like Out Of My League and One Day. If you want an Electronic album, the debut album is the one to get! That one is non-stop all the way!"
3,Too many chefs?,"It's somewhat ironic that 2 guitar players would form England's 1st post-punk supergroup and name it ""Electronic"", but that's exactly what Bernard Sumner and Johnny Marr did. The name proved to be apt when the 2 paired with the Pet Shop Boys for their 1st (self titled) album, a remarkably cohesive affair, blending elctronics, big beats and guitars into pleasant whole. For ""Raise the Pressure"", another artist well known to the electronic community was enlisted, this time Karl Bartos, formerly of Kraftwerk. The results aren't as cohesive. It's not that the songs are bad, it's that they're unbalanced. Apparently undecided on any particular sound, the boys start messing with everything, guitar pop backed by synth, synth pop backed by guitar, pure synth pop, house music, and ambient. Even the Kraftwerkian vocoder makes an appearance. It all sits uneasily side by side, making an album full of good music, just not music that belongs together."
4,Barney on Prozac,"Supposedly Bernard Sumner was on Prozac while writing the songs for this album. Does it reflect in the music? Perhaps. As I recall him quoting in a magazine prior to its release ""the songs are less deep because I was less deep"" Irregardless, I think the main weakness of this album is that they played it too safe. It is the same formula, just mixed a little differently, take out the Neil Tennant, and what you have is an album where all the songs are good, but none of them are great. I give it 4 stars because it is a solid, well crafted album. It just misses a certain ""magic"" that their first album had."
2,Very cute but extremely small,I have used this bag a couple of times and that was it. It is sitting in the closet. Very cute and that's why I gave it two stars but not very practical because you can hardly fit anything.
5,Bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law,She really loves this group and I bought this for her so she could watch it anytime she wanted. She said that she really enjoyed this dvd.
5,"Great video, out of print...","For two years, she slipped, largely unseen, across the waters of the Atlantic, recording over 60 victories and intercepting nearly $6 million worth of goods from the Union. Under the command of Captain Raphael Semmes, the sloop Alabama was the most feared vessel of the Civil War. GHOST SHIP OF THE CONFEDERACY is a detailed look at the career of this fabled vessel, based largely on the extensive diaries of Captain Semmes and her officers, as well as countless other Civil War documents from both sides. Discover how she earned her legend as a ""ghost ship"" from her practice of re-supplying at sea using spoils captured from defeated ships. Relive her greatest victories with Civil War historians, and learn the remarkable tale of her defeat, when she was sunk off the coast of France by the USS Kersage after an epic battle in which 250 rounds were exchanged."
1,I'd give this a -100000000000000 if I could,"what a pretentious load of $#!+ !!!WOW, these people are so great, so important, & so much better than you. It is incredible: the arrogance of these people. They think that the world would stop without them. They are so smart; there is nothing they don't know. They work harder than anyone. They are more imaginative. They immerse themselves in some sort of long-lost aesthetic. ""they way I approach photograhpy is spontaneous"". well, whooppdy-freaking-doo for you.I want my money back.in fact, I think someone owes me a few million dollars for pain & suffering.I can't stand it. seriously. I'm going to cut these discs into a million pieces throw them into a toilet that has just been used for some #1 & #2 action, & I will call it art & that piece will be featured in the next installment of this series, & they will interview me, & I can talk about how inspired I was & how important I am."
2,Not Impressed!,"Compared to other carb cycling diet type books, I did not find this one impressive. It seemed dated. Not many interesting recipes. I feel you can do better with other books."
5,Virgins of..Worthy..,"I am into collecting all the older movies such as this and findthem funny as well as interesting and the ones I have bought arebecoming part of my collection. I would recommend this one ifyou are into a funny, sexy, nude version of Robin Hood."
2,.. nice idea but...,When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...
2,Clear cutting of Sherwood Forest,Video quality could be better and the appearances of featured 'star'were fewer than expected.
4,Shannan Leigh.,"There were only two scenes in this movie I cared for. The first guy Shannan Leigh does, and the second guy Shannan Leigh does. For a softcore flick it's not too bad. If you're a Shannan Leigh fan this is a must-own. The two scenes she did alone were definitely worth the purchase. Two of the best scenes softcore has to offer in my book."
2,"What do you expect from a ""B"" movie?",I got what i paid for...not much more to say.If you want anything harder go to your local xxx shop.
3,ok film,"This film was ok, but I didn't like that they had music to block the women moaning during the sex scenes."
2,Robin Hood it's not,"I spent most of the time in fast forward, and don't think that I missed any of the plot. I gave it a 2 because it was not so bad that I turned it off. A good movie to put on in the backround, if you are not going to pay it much attention."
2,Only watch it if you are a Brian Heidik fan!,"He is the winnner of the latest Survivor & is in this movie. It is barely watchable, only view it if you are a die hard fan!"
4,good,"the author (who taught my java course) is a great lecturer, and the book reflects it. although it came in black and white (i was expecting colored version!!!) it was very useful. lots of demand for used book too."
4,Java: An Eventful Approach Review,"It's a good book overall. It offers a more practical approach to object-oriented programming. The fun excercises challenged me enough to make me confident in each lesson. However, because it's only a first edition, there were numerous spelling and syntax mistakes. Nonetheless, I learned an incredible amount about Java and have now found a new hobby."
1,Missing Pages,"This treatise is incomplete. It was originally published in 1978 as the first of two volumes, but Tribe has apparently never gotten around to writing the second volume. I have a copy on my shelf, and about half the time I go to look up a topic it is not covered in the first volume. There are many other good constitutional law treaties - buy one of those instead. Or, wait until Tribe finally publishes the second volume before buying this treatise."
2,"Good stuff, but the postage costs more.",This is a wonderful fiery condiment! I suppose I should have checked the profile before placing the order. The handling and shipping ended up costing more than the product.
1,not good,"compared to the mina harissa this product isn't good at all... very bitter, too salty and overall tastes bad. I used it once and haven't touched it since. Not a good product!"
5,Good authentic Moroccan harissa,"If you like hot sauce, you'll like this harissa. This harissa is salty and hot, with a roasted pepper taste to it. Very good to use as an ingredient in Moroccan cooking or as a condiment. My spouse is from Morocco and says this is an authentic tasting harissa. A staple in my house! We love it on chicken and sandwiches, especially."
4,Good Comedy,"I had a chance to see this movie screened in Austin, TX for SXSW film festival. I thought the film was hilarious and well done for it to have only been shot over the course of 15 days according to one of the producers who offerd Q & A about the film."
4,Cool Movie,"This film is a cool, heart-felt indie film about how friendships change as people grow up and grow apart. There are some really funny and home-hitting scenes. On a side note, all the actors are beautiful."
1,dysfunctional movie,Terrible acting in a completely improbable situation. Beautiful people in a one-dimensional movie that could have been great if it hadn't been written by someone who must assume the audience is filled with idiots. Simply put-terrible.
2,"Entertaining, If You're Drunk","And I was... drunk that is. This was a 1-dimensional story with stereotypical characters. Too bad because the plot had potential. But, the characters had no depth. All they did was put each other down and put everyone's dirty laundry out on front street. People don't really talk to each other like that, not anyone I know anyway. If they did, there would be bloodshed! Like I said, it had potential but failed to deliver. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I was able to watch it to the end, and I liked most of the cast (great to see Tatyana Ali, Stacey Dash, Persia White, and Essence Atkins). Basically, only the first and last 10 minutes were good. Do not watch this sober! You will regret it."
2,Never got to finish,"This was on prime instant today to watch for free- I got half way thru, had to pause for like 10 min and came back and it was stuck- I reset and found that I now have to rent it- very annoyed with Amazon that I couldnt even finish it...."
1,Not so great,"A bunch of has been and never have been actors, no depth, no plot, a waste of money in my opinion"
3,It was ok.,Well this movie wasnt the greatest but it keeps you focused on the movie.The characters in the movie was great but the movie needed a little more storyline.It was interesting but I have seen worse.
4,ummm... loved the actors ;),I received the package in a timely manner.. no problems.. my issue was that something was missing in this production. I don't know what.. but it fell a little flat for me.. it was too predictable with a lot of unnecessary cursing that seemed to come from mouths of people who probably don't curse so it sounded... weird. It was just off. The people were all gorgeous and unrealistic looking. The guys were nice to look at though.. especially Christian Keyes ;)
5,LOVED IT!,Loved it! and that say it all. I was intertained and watched this movie in one sitting without any break. I will search for more movies frome the is producer to watch.
1,Pass,The cast was far more entertaining than the actual movie. Prob one if the worst 1.20 redbox movies spent although it kept my attn i wouldnt have paid more to see it.
3,Just ok,"Great looking cast but that's about it. This movie was lacking some things. The acting was just ok and the plot was clear but this flick was very mediocre. The funny parts weren't that funny, the sad parts weren't that sad but you could just tell that it was supposed to be an emotional moment. It coud've been better."
1,Movie was disappointing,"The description of the movie seemed interesting and funny. However, the actual movie was childish in its script for accomplished adults playing the roles and unnecessarily lewd and vulgar in language and scenes. Not worth buying or looking at this one."
2,Wack,This movie was wack. I watched it because I was so bored. I could tell where the storyline was going. But I don't get it.
1,Avoid it,"This movie is terrible. It isn't even worth watching during one of your ""I don't really care I just want to be distracted"" TV watching moments."
2,A Phamphlet,"The description fails to mention that this pamphlet is for the State of MAINE, only. Nothing for the animals indigenous to the western states."
4,"The good, the bad, and the naked.","In this early Surrender Cinema softcore offering, Kim Yates and Amy Lindsay get transported back to the old west. They become prostitutes, have sex with a priest, get thrown in jail, and escape. None of those things are actually related though.There are seven sex scenes. Six are boy/girl and one is boy/girl/girl. All of them are good. I thought the two scenes with Kim were the best. In addition to Kim and Amy, we also get an eyeful of Amber Newman, Shannon Malone, and Taimie Hannum. Since this is a Surrender release, the only thing you hear during the sex scenes is music. The sex isn't as hot as some of Surrender's better releases, but it's much better than their worst ones.This is a Koch release, so I want to point out that it really does contain the unrated version and not a cut up, R rated version.This isn't a must have, but for its price, it delivers quite a bit, so I recommend it."
1,Not Compatible with Intel Mac,"I checked Maccaly's website and they stated that they do not plan on creating an updated driver for Intel-based Macs. Wow, thanks for nothing Macally."
1,Garbage,"This is a very poorly made video. It consists of clips of the Manson interview with photographs spliced in. The production quality is terrible, and the narration is even worse. Nikolas Schreck (the director) narrates. He does the whole thing in a comic monotone 'spooky' voice, like what you expect from a haunted house guide at Disneyland. I guess this is to be expected, as he is a former 'Church of Satan' evangelist.There is little to no original content to this film, and I think much of it was taken directly from 'Helter Skelter'. Schreck also tries to portray Manson in a sympathetic light. I recommend that you read up on Schreck before you rent this movie. He's a conspiracy theory nut who describes Manson as a 'media-created monster'.The only worthwhile parts of this video are the clips of Manson in the interview, but even those get old. Watching a 60 year old Manson rant and rave his incoherent nonsense is only entertaining for a few minutes."
5,Brilliant,It's absolutely wonderful just love the thirties style rendition of these popular tunes from my era. First heard Macarthur Park on ABC FM Classical (Australia) and searched on Google hoping to find a copy; after some time eventually found on Amazon and have no hesitation in recommending this disc to like minded people.
2,not that great,as the product says there are multiple short stories in the book and not 1 story which i did not find enternaining contrary to my hopes. jokes are the usual ones and theres not much new unless u r a great fan.
5,Well pleased,"I have always loved Asterix and Obelix and so when I heard about the new book I had to get it. The stories are quite short but very interesting to read. For each story there is a small summary about how each was created and where it was first seen, so that you can learn some background information about the story and the authors. The only sad thing for me was that each story is so short, but as you have 15 or so stories it makes up for that fact. Hope you enjoy it was well."
2,Not the greatest Asterix adventure,"Not the greatest Asterix adventure... and I can't remember one before this one that wasn't good. As an Asterix fan, I expected more!!! This book is a mish-mash of short stories and none does justice to a true Asterix fan. I'd just borrow it from the public library instead of spending the $14 I spent a while ago."
4,Asterix,"My favorite stories have to be When Asterix and Obelix were born and how the romans made Dogmatix their mascot, it was intresting to see thier friends as kids and them as babies. There is only short stories in this, none of them connect. The humor in this is not as funny in the other books and they made it much different from the other stories. If you are more into long stories I suggest you won't get this one. Hope I helped."
1,"Bad photos, Bad Battery Life","The quality of the photos taken by this camera are abysmal. Outdoors, indoors, bright light, low light, it didn't matter. The only remotely acceptable images captured by this camera came after mounting the body to a tripod and shooting a nearby stationary object under controlled lighting. Hardly the advertised intended use.I returned the camera to the manufacturer, assuming I'd got a lemon. Without a word (or a refund of the shipping charges), Bushnell sent me a brand new replacement camera that won't turn on, even with brand-new batteries. I now get to call them yet again and perhaps this time I won't have to cough up the money to have it replaced.I hope that perhaps I just got unlucky twice and that I can get one that is as good as it sounds. If not though, if this is truly the quality of this camera, then I would seriously reconsider ever purchasing any Bushnell product again."
3,Price is the key,"It's a good little camera, definitely rugged, and the best feature is that it's water-resistant (although not waterproof). Suitable for your boat or hunting blind -- you won't worry about hurting it like you would your ""good"" camera"" or mobile phone. Uses AA batteries, which is nice for changing when you're out in the field. I'd HIGHLY recommend rechargeable AA batteries for it, though. I haven't had any problems with the photo quality. I think people's major complaint with it in the past has been because of the price. Don't pay over $100 for it -- certainly not the $250 retail asking price -- just for the Bushnell name."
1,Works great for 4 or 5 minutes,"This drive *looks* great, but mine only works for a few minutes at a time before disconnecting (even in the middle of data transfer) for no apparent reason. I tested the drive on several machines (3 Windows 2000 boxes and 1 Mac running OS X) and all had the same problem. Also tried both USB 1.1 and 2.0 ports, to no avail. Thank goodness this happened right out of the box rather than several months down the road when it would contain critical data."
3,Decent Harp,"I've always played Hohner harps and decided to try a Lee Oscar after a friend recommended the brand. It plays well enough but feels light and ""toy-like"" in the hand. Since the price is comparable to the Hohner, I will probably stick with that brand in the future."
5,"Minor Blues or Minor Jazz, Major impact Harmonicas","I played the Em Lee Oskar harp at a gig recently on a Latin American Samba and Rhumba tune. It sounded so good that people could not believe I only had played 2 days in my life. The point being, if you are musically inclined, this instrument will do it for you. Well worth every cent. I happen to know Lee Oskar but his harps were accessible through Amazon. I will shop for more.BlueSpace"
5,Great CD full of Sheryl's best songs!,"Sheryl Crow, Tomorrow Never Dies, is a wonderful CD with not just one song, but 4! They aren't some of her hits, but they are definitely some of her greatest! I've been a long time Sheryl Crow fan and I just had to have this CD, and I sure don't regret it. The selection of chosen songs for this CD seem to be moody, sad songs that tear at your heart strings because of Sheryl's voice, proving that she rocks!"
4,same as but better,"This is so similar to The Loom's Desire --solo with piano and back-up harmony group on some of the songs-- but Laura is in finer form here. He singing is more intense and emotional on this live recording. The jacket actually has pictures of her taken at the time too, instead of the old photos used on all the other post-humus releases."
3,Intermittently involving and pedestrian,"The stories in this brief volume read more like anecdotal reminiscences than fiction. Reminded me of the tone of Joyce's ""Dubliners"" in their attempt to combine the mundane with the transcendent. However, their often flat tone distances the reader from identifying with the characters. This may be due to translation, but for an English-language reader, the interest conveyed through these wartime vignettes of Budapest Jewry endures more than their literary merit. Tbe final story, however, nearly redeems the interrelated collection with its epiphany of an imagined revival of the district today."
3,"A Chicken is a Pork Storker!,","I got the wrong order for one, they sent me ""Chicken gizzards dipped in vinegar oil""! And on top of that it cost me $49.99 for shipping charges, not to mention the sprained back the post office man got when he lifted up my order. I'm not particular to vinegar but I tried them anyways and I have to say they weren't that bad."
4,Que Viva Thalia!,I bought this album when it first came out and I still love it! It has a wonderful mix of spanish rhythms which would appeal to many tastes. I cant wait till the release of her English language album!
5,Amor A La Mexicana!,"This is, in my opinion the best album Thalia at EMI. Brings classics, like the ballads ""Es Tu Amor,"" ""Dicen Por Ahi"" and ""Rosas"". It also has Latin rhythms, especially the title track ""Amor A La Mexicana"" ""Por Amor"" and ""Mujer Latina"". The last three appear in remix versions, in the Mexican Edition. An album ""a la mexicana""!"
5,C'est fantastique!,"Thalia est simplement la meilleure artiste latine de tout le temps. J'ai recemment acheté le CD ""Por Amor"", qui veut dire ""Pour Amour"" en franais, et je dois dire que je suis très emocioné de l'avoir. Les chansons que j'ai aimé le plus sont ""Amor a la Mexicana"" version remixe, et aussi ""Por Amor"", version remixe. Le rythms dans ces deux chansons sont très comfortable, et surtout font les personnes que les écoutent dancer avec la musique. Ja crois que tous doivent achete ce CD, puique Thalia est bien sr la artiste la plus internacionelle d'aujourd'hui. VIVE THALIA!"
4,Good but predictable,"Thalía is one of my fav. latin singers and it's not just because she looks beautiful! This is probably her best album, it's packed with strong but fun hits that are all very friendly to the old ear. The big problem is that it has very little originality: it has elements of just about every other Latin song around! Take for example ""Mujer Latina"" which is an excellent song, but the tune sounds way too familiar and predictable. This isn't really a major issue but I do feel the album really lacks any originality!But, Thalia can sing and make a nice loada tunes so don't be put off-it's a good album!"
5,An Excellent Work of Art!!!,"Este Album es uno de los mejores Cd's de Thalia. Desde la primera cancion hasta la ultima, te dejara sorprendido. Los sonidos son excelentes. Las Letras son muy buenas y el mensaje que Thalia preyecta en cada cancion es Unico. Un Album que gano muchos premios en el 1995-1996. Incluyendo el Premio al Mejor Alfum Femenino del ano.I strongly recommend this ALBUM. This is a Must Buy. Thalia has it all: Beauty, Talent, fame....etc."
5,"THALÍA, THE BEST LATIN SINGER!","I've followed Thalía's career since her begginings. First like a part of the mexican pop group ""Timbiriche"", later like a soloist singer, and I only can tell to all the world, that Thalía has improved her voice, style and talent in a way that really impress!I recommend this album ""Amor a la Mexicana"" like one of the best in latin music and like the best work of this great Mexican Super Star."
2,ya no me late...,"THalia used to be one of my favorite singers. Used to be. But ever since EN EXTASIS, all her albums sound the same and I just can't get into her new sound. Production wise it's very good, but I miss the old Thalia. I think her new music is too comericial and she just lacks that something that she had years ago. I miss the Thalia w/ a thousand flowers all over her and her cheesy techno dance songs like LOVE, and songs like SANGRE, SUDOR, UN PACTO ENTRE LOS DOS, etc. I recommend JUGO DE EXITOS cause it has vintage Thalia..."
3,Thalia has it but not enough,"If you like Latin music this has danceable tunes for your ears. Especially her hit song, which is also the title of the CD ""Amor A La Mexicana"" has it's own place on the CD. I am giving it 3 stars for I think that she could done better with the Latin portions, it did not have the dance/relax mix that I was looking for. Most of the songs very much in the same realms compared to other Latin artist who have more of a variety. Good Listening."
5,Classics,"My husband absolutely loves Edgar Rice Burrough's writing style. He reads them over and over again, with much delight. I was really pleased I could order this through Amazon. It was shipped in a reasonable time period."
4,worthwhile for any level of fitness,"I have been a fan of Denise Austin for years. I ordered the xtra lite tone up, because I havent done any formal exercise in about 12 yrs. So I was out of shape. It was almost TOO lite. But still a very worthwhile video for your library. It is perfect for those days that you are sore from overdoing the previous day. Or on days that you maybe have a cold and dont feel that well, but dont want to miss your workout. It is strictly toning, so you arent going to get fit owning only this one tape. You can increase the intensity of the workout by using heavier weights, or adding ankle weights. I enjoyed it, I used 3 lb weights which was perfect for me. I would like to add some ankle weights, because the lower body workout was too easy. Just had a baby? Havent worked out in a long time? Need a lite backup for days you cant work out as heavily as usual? This is the tape for you. Concentrates on posture, and how to exercise correctly. Good instruction from Ms Austin as well."
1,Horrible Video,"After buying Xtra Light Aerobics by Denise Austin and loving it, I thought I'd try this one. What a waste. You do the same step about a hundred times- okay slight exaggeration. I had been working out with weights before this, just 10 lbs on each arm with various exercises. When I tried this one I used 3 lbs on each arm. The steps themselves weren't that difficult, but she never let up. You would do so many reps without a break in between. I couldn't do it. I went back to my own work-out and did a lot better. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,Not Impressed,"If you are buying this book for anything other then the Kindle don't bother downloading it. It has what they call DRM (Digital Rights Management). In a nutshell, They take your money and hold your book for ransom, I have used Calibre and still am out of luck."
2,Lots of problems with this docu,"I really wanted to like this documentary...I like Bruce and i like the documentary maker.The documentary was interesting for about 15 minutes and then it just dragged on being about 2 hours of the same things being said.. Definitely should have stopped after an hour tops...Also, the fact that this was completely un-authorized by Bruce & Co., there was no Bruce music in the documentary... Which would have been fine if there was some content involved..All this documentary had was interview after interview talking about how great Bruce is and how great the fans are.. I got that point after 15 minutes.. anything after was pure torture to watch..."
4,COMPLETE RECORDING TO BE REISSUSED BY DECCA,"Mado Robin's classic recording of Lakme is represented here by only a skimpy half hour of highlights. I knew there was a complete recording out there somewhere, and sure enough, Decca has announced its forthcoming release as part of its Original Masters series (475 6793 6 DC2). Once again, those Decca folks up to their old tricks! Hold off on this one and just get the complete recording."
5,This baby can hunt!,"I'm an avid golfer, and I bought the ""hunter's"" version of the Bushnell rangefinder by mistake; intending to buy the ""pinseeker"" version. Based on the reviews, and researching the elite 1500 at Bushnell's web site, I was convinced the pinseeker and bullseye technology are identical. I therefore kept the hunter's version, being too lazy to go through the return process. On the course today, I never missed a pin using the bullseye setting. Occasionally, I would get the background yardage for a second, and then the flag setting would kick in. I could also easily mark the distance to the 150 post for driving purposes, or, on par 5s, hit the flag distance (which was a breeze), and I could backout that distance by 100 yards to get the perfect lay up. One note. The 9 volt battery didn't come in the box, so you may want to buy one when you buy this device. Can highly recommend."
2,Yardage Pro Elite,"despite claims, I've had trouble getting this to range anything over 200 yards, even on very bright and distinct targets. Overall, extremely disappointed."
3,Not recommended,"Poor choice of common names, contains some out-dated scientific taxonomy. Photographs and artwork are great. Text is good. The only book available on Missouri's herpetofauna; buy it, and wait for a newer, modern version."
1,NO GOOD! KEEP AWAY!!!,"Yeah, great songs on here. Only problem is that the members of republica didn't even know about it until AFTER it came out, so I won't be buying it. If you're interested in Saffron (the lead singer), check out S W A R M, her new project. Ciao."
5,stuart redeems himself : spoiler,"this is one of the best masters of horror, had a really cute ending to a thrilling horror masterpiece"
1,Please enter a title for your review,another equal worst episode of the series. the entire thing is like watching paint dry from start to finish. it could have been edited down to 10 minutes and would still have failed to hold my interest. it has the requisite bloody gore scene which comes out of nowhere and as always is shot close up centre frame to make it a contextless spectacle.
1,A WASTE OF MONEY.,"I DIDN'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.IT WAS VERY BORING.IT MOSTLY SHOWED HIS WIFE DYING.IT KEPT SHOWING THAT OVER AND OVER,BUT IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF HER DYING.HE'S STARTING TO GO NUTS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE HER-THAN HE STARTS TO IMAGINE THINGS THAT THE BLACK CAT'S DOING.THEN HE STARTS TO PICK ON THE CAT.I CAN'T TELL NO MORE ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THERE IS.I'M A BIG FAN OF THE MASTERS OF HORROR-BUT THIS IS STUPID AND A WASTE OF MONEY.THAT'S MY OPINION.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS MOVIE."
4,Excellent Adaptation of a Classic Tale,"Bravo! I have to admit I have finally been impressed by the lack luster MOH series. This is by far the finest piece of work I have seen out of all the MOH short films.The Black Cat is a classic Edgar Allen Poe tale that was created perfectly by Stuart Gordon.It was slightly slow at the start but picked up beautifully half way through. It wasn't scary (if thats what you're looking for) but it was intense and extremely well put together. I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a unique viewing experience, especially if you are a fan of the MOH series."
4,Poly Snow Shovel Review,"Although this shovel was over 2 weeks in arriving, and missed 3 snowstorms, it was appreciated when it arrived. The box had been beaten up, and there was a hole in it, but the shovel was fine. Using it is OK, and I would have given it a 5, but the handle kept coming loose. Still in all, I am appreciative for the shovel, and since New Mexico got caught off guard, and did not have enough shovels to buy, I am grateful, as it beats removing snow with a broom!"
5,A quality inverter.,"Mine has been working fine for six years now, used in my work van in conditions of heat, extreme cold and jarring vibration. The fan died two years ago, so I picked up a replacement fan at a computer store. Running it in below zero cold probably spun the bearing, so it doesn't reflect poorly on its performance. I've used it to power a laptop for GPS duty, charge my cordless drill, cellphone, shaver, video equipment, soldering gun, hot glue gun and just about anything else I needed to on the go."
5,Perfect book for beginning readers,"The Biscuit books have been the greatest motivator for my daughter who has been struggling with learning to read. The text is good for an emergent reader who is just beginning to learn sight words and phonics. The illustrations of Biscuit are delightful. These are wonderful books. I only wish I could get a series of them in paperback, quick, to keep her reading!"
4,My 20 Month Old Loves Biscuit,"I needed to add a filler or two to a recent order with Amazon so I picked out two Biscuit stories for my 20 month old son who loves books. He took to ""Biscuit Finds a Friend"" right away and is now a Biscuit fan. The story is very simple and easy for my son to follow along. Be prepared to say ""woof, woof"" over and over, but it's worth it!"
5,"""It not enough to succeed. Your friends must also fail.""","A masterpiece, but who is the master? Von Trier the 'obstructor' or Leth, his friend and former teacher?Don't be put off (as I was) by the structure, in which Leth is challenged to remake one of his 1960s experimental films, subject to a series of constraints imposed by von Trier. It sounds like a recipe for self-indulgent intellectual backslapping, and my expectations were low when the first 'obstruction' was a limit of 12 frames (half a second) on the length of each shot. But when, to von Trier's stifled dismay, Leth produces a beautifully rhythmical and sensual response, I realised I was watching something special. The sheer talent of the principals, driven by each's urge to prove themself equal to the other, makes this a fascinating exploration not just of creativity but also friendship."
4,Only One Thing Missing,"I recently saw this film at the Palm Springs Film Festival having never seen any work by either director and was thoroughly entertained. It became quite obvious by the second ""obstruction"" that Leth ultimately loves a challenge, no matter how much he might at first protest, so seeing his reaction to a free-style, no rules applied third obstruction was quite interesting.My only complaint is that I feel one would have gotten slightly more from this film having seen the original ""The Perfect Human"" in its entirety before watching these five recreations. Granted, scenes are shown throughout the film, but when it was over I wondered what I might have picked up on if I'd scene the original short before seeing this film.The good news is it's included on the DVD, which I plan on purchasing soon."
1,"The skip button is your friend, it is there to help you","Who, even the two grossly self-indulgent old fards whose faces we see to the point of gagging, could imagine that this blank-witted turkey could be of interest to anybody? When a movie (well...this thing _resembles_ a movie) is ugly to look at, plotless, action-free, humorless, and unmusical, what excuse does it have for existing? It may someday overtake ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" as the most fast-forwarded flick in the world.I guess they don't have much to do in Denmark."
4,Not the Perfect Movie,"ok, I've seen a few movies by the maker of this one (Dogville comes to mind) and I am a fan of foreign/ art/ cult films. Overall, this was an interesting film. Most of all, it made me want to see ""The Perfect Human"", which I had never even heard of before.This was well crafted, well filmed and held my interest. The addition of ""The Perfect Human"" on the DVD sold me. Recommended."
4,Pretty good,"I originally saw this program when it aired on TV in 99. I think I saw all of it but may have missed some of it so I will qualify my review that way.Mike Wallace has always been a fair reporter as far as I'm concerned. Journalists should look to him for inspiration of what a news man (or woman) should hold themselves to as far as unbiased reporting is concerned.Wallace does the gun debate justice. No matter what side you may be on you will find this program worth watching. It covers the anti gun viewpoint as well as the pro gun with equal exposure. There are a couple of people on both sides of the debate featured in this program however that I think should have been left on the cutting room floor, because they portray their views very poorly.If you are just getting into the gun debate, or are a long time supporter or protractor of the 2nd ammendment, this program is worth watching."
4,Ted Support hose,"I use these stockings to help protect my leg veins from forming clots which then may go to my lungs and create serious disability. The TED hose are comfortable, not obvious under standard trousers, wash easily, and keep swelling of my legs down most of the time. They are easily washed and reused, and seem to retain their elastic integrity for a good time."
4,"Yeah, Baby! Shagadelic!","Campbell's discussion of common flaws and fallacies in statistical reasoning is clear and useful, but those cringe-inducing ""sexy"" cartoons from those swinging, wife-swapping, care-free early 1970s are manna from camp heaven! Every other page features would-be witty drawings of hip, bearded, wide-tie-wearing swinger dudes ogling mini-skirted chicks and making sexist remarks--all of which bear scant relation to the topics being discussed. Example: In a chapter on rates of rise and fall we see Hepcat Swinger Dude leering at backside of chick's tiny miniskirt as he wishes aloud that trends will continue to rise. (How very droll, Noel!) Yeah, that'll go over well in today's colleges. No wonder it's out of print and has been replaced with a heavily revised and re-titled version for today's market.If you have a taste for politically incorrect 70s kitsch and want to learn some useful stuff about statistical fallacies, get this book now!"
4,More Tha A Little Unusual,"I have listened to Wayne seriously since 1986. Musical interests for me in the past have included everything from Iggy Popp to Sex Pistols to Tangerine Dream. I've always been stirred by Waynes voice and lyrical content, but have not been sure if he was just synthesized as far as background sound. I have been a sound man for several bands, and am pretty critical as to sound and talent. I recently saw Wayne perform live with no accompanying musicians, and was astounded. He blew away 98% of the rock musicians I've seen for talent. In fact, I'd put him in the category of people like Rory Gallagher, and Roy Buchanan for sheer talent. This guy can write, sing and play several instruments like a virtuoso. Oh yes he has many good cd's, this one included. I personally am found of his release from the year 2000, with the tune, ""More Than A Little Unusual""."
5,very inspirational,"I first heard the title song on a ""Keep The Faith"" cd collection I bought. i have since purchased the CD. The first time I heard Field of Souls I cried, simply because it spoke to me. I cannot be a missionary, and leave husband and children, but Wayne's song showed me that I am important to the Lord for remembering to pray for those who can. The rest of the CD is wonderful, and the song called ""Rock Steady' is very upbeat, fast, and to the point, I love it. Also another fav is ""Don't You remember"". They all speak to your heart. The Lord placed this specific CD at my fingertips, I ask Him for it before going in the store, and I just wanted to check out the sale table, since new owners had taken over, and were discounting everything with the other stores label. And as I started through the long line of CD's, this was the 3rd. He gave it to me, He is wonderful, and Wayne shares his love of Him with you. You won't be sorry"
5,Uplifting Music,"I purchased this CD because I love the last song ""Blessed Are"". However, I am much blessed by all the songs. They seem to speak to whatever need I have at the time. We all can relate to ""Rock Steady""!"
5,A must have for the architects library,"This collection of works offers a unique view into the inspiration that fueled the creative energy of one of the most influential architects of this century. The title is true to its name. The usage of parallel imagery is found throughout the book and catalyzes the reader to look closer at the world around them recognizing and combining complementary forms to create magnificent modern structures. A must read for architects, aspiring and practiced, who are looking to develop or uncover new perspectives in there work."
3,a voice from the past,"Set in a time long, long ago, this book is written as a journal in the voice & by the hand of Ceridwen, a young matron & Mistress of the Kilton Hall, just as two cultures clash, the Anglo-Saxons at home on the land of Wessex after many generations & forming themselves into one kingdom, & the Vikings, who come raiding from across the seas.There is also another battle being fought - between the new Christianity that wants to silence the Old Ways of the Ancestors.If you like to immerse yourself in history as seen through a woman's eyes, from a bygone era, then let the cat out, light the fire & kick back in your chair. When you start CERIDWEN OF KILTON, be prepared to disappear into another time, another world.It takes a while to get all the characters' names straight, & how they are related. After a while you'll even get used to the language."
4,A poignant and exciting tale,"Ceridwen of Kilton is a beautiful and touching story, a tale of passion and high adventure. The straight, simple style of narration puts life and colour into the scenes and characters. The tale set in ancient England brings alive those times for an unfamiliar reader, with Ceridwen taking her readers through her strange and exciting life with simple poise.It is a lovely and exciting story, a good change from all the psychological introspection and existentialism that seem to fill most novels today; ideal reading for bookworms who have been depressed out of their wits by ""thinking"" authors!"
5,Fascinating from start to finish,"I found the trilogy on line and read it within a week. The fast paced,moving story is so enthralling you forget wht day it is. The characters and the language turn this trilogy into a adventure in learning."
3,Middle of the Road indeed,"US Top 40 lovers might vaguely remember ""Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep"" a hit in Hawaii and some parts of Western states,a bigger hit worldwide. Middle of the Road was inbetween girl group pop and basic late 60's early 70's reminicent of so- called ""Bubble Gum"" , but more like the England studio bands with Tony Burrows heading groups like White Plains (My Baby Loves Love) Edison Lighthouse (Love Grow where My Rosemary Goes) First Class (Beach Baby) Pipkins (Gimme Dat Ding) but with a female lead singer mostly.Middle of the Road could be considered a fore-runner of ABBA. Thebeat is there, the harmonies ring ring, the production has the blast at the end.In the end, though,this is for only those who like a period of 70's rock, who lived, loved through it, and want to keep it alive!!!"
4,The Scottish ABBA,"The Scottish ABBA. Bridges bubblegum, the pattycake fun of early 60s girl groups but has solid 70s production which makes it an almost all new thing. The studio tricks to make her harmonize with herself are interesting but it is the early 70s proto glam rock production on the backing band that really make this stand out in time. The song ""Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep"" is the near perfect simple rhyme and rhythm handclap stupidness that borders on transcendence. Pop music to pet warm puppies by. Usually this type of pop would only be made on the continent, where English was a second, third or fourth language, it is that cheesy. Like professionally bottled sunshine."
5,i love the cd,the cd arrived in time. it was new and professionally wrapped. i love the sound quality. thanks a lot. you have a new and happy customer.
1,Pablum,"After reading reviews for the past 10 years I had the opportunity to buy this SACD used for $3.63. Mistake. This is a great group of musicians playing great music, but unfortunatley they were directed to play in a manner that only makes it work as a collection of lullabies.I have never purchadsed a cd that I could not find one tune to like.... until now. Wasted $3.63.I am not going to complain about the producers, as Telarc has given memuch great music to listen to over the years, I'll let them slide on this POS."
3,Liner Notes Illuminate the CD,"I've read the other reviews posted here, and the ones that lean toward ranting against this CD have apparently not read the liner notes. Read them and you'll see that all involved in this project knew they were treading in perilous waters when they attempted to ""cover"" such an ambitous and original catalog as is Weather Report's. They were trying to pay homage, and the folks involved have both the credentials and the chops to qualify for making the attempt.Lighten up. The record was not meant as a reinterpretation or an updating of WR's music. It was meant as a tribute to one of the greatest jazz ensembles of any generation(in my book, anyway).One reviewer said the musicians involved in the project had ""no heart."" I dare him to tell that to the Brecker Brothers face to face..."
3,Stormy Weather,"I was excited to find this release while surfing around. Maybe someone could stimulate some interest in one of my favorite bands. Much thought went into this project and overall it is very well done. My major concern centers around two things. One is Jason Miles's ""programming"" and the other is the tendency to ""smooth out"" these songs. I sense an attempt to get this music played on the numerous smooth jazz radio stations that have cropped up all over.The music sounds fresh. Glad to see four songs written by Wayne Shorter included. I am uncertain if true WEATHER REPORT fans will enjoy this but it should serve as a good place for someone to start that is interested in jazz/fusion music."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"And that is...introduce NEW listeners to the wonderful music of Weather Report (not cater to the jazz/fusion die-hards who already have all of WR's albums). If you are not familiar with Weather Report's music, start here. All of the melodies are extremely catchy - they will make you want to go out and buy the original WR albums. These covers get four stars; the originals get five stars."
2,"Unimaginative, unimpressed","The front cover of this CD proudly boasts a hall-of-fame cast of jazz fusionists (the Brecker brothers, Marcus Miller, John Patitucci, etc.). From the promising cover on, it's steeply downhill. These guys for the most part simply go through the motions without any passion, when the disc SHOULD have been on FIRE from start to finish. Drained of energy and watered-down for the ""smooth jazz dollar"" I can only suggest the curious opt for the original Weather Report albums -- 30 years old, but sounding a lot fresher than this offering."
1,JKAFBJSKAFGHFSALGNJFSABVLJSADBFHADFLA,"WHAT!!!?What has happened to all the music of Weather Report on this... this.. THING!What is this - some sort of Kenny G/Michael Bolton collaboration? And Look at all the big names - The Brecker Brothers, Victor Bailey, Steve Gadd, Marcus Miller, Omar Hakim -And Birdland - WHAT'S WITH THE VOICES!!? and not to forget THE ""Smoothy Feel"" THAT COMES WITH THIS REMAKE OF BIRDLAND (and the rest of this album)!And what about Cannon Ball? What about that? I think SHLOOOBY is the word.And Badia??don't even talk to me about mysterious traveller.NOW I'm sure they had their hearts in the right place, but THIS IS REALLY THE BIGGEST DOSE OF...you know...all I have to say is ARGHHH!!!!and to the guy who said the liner notes illuminate the CD - the only thing that could illuminate this cd is a box of matches!!!!...i'll be in my room if you need me"
2,Weather Report-the easy listening version,"I was initially excited when I first saw this CD, then disappointed after hearing it. With exception of Scofield, the Brecker Brothers, and Sanborn the whole thing lacks energy. It seems that the music was ""smoothed"" out for easy listening, lite jazz radio play. I suppose if it gets people to go back and listen to the original recordings its done it's job, but I expected better."
2,Often imitated; never duplicated...,"Weather Report sported an esoteric music style which to this day remains in a class by itself. Unfortunately, this fine ensemble is beknownst only to a select number of jazz music fans; hence, the incentive to create such a compilation seems mysterious. The contemporary arrangements are ultimately disappointing and typically ignore the fire and passion of the original recordings. The album features cuts from Mysterious Traveler, Tale Spinnin', Black Market, Heavy Weather, and Mr. Gone."
5,Gotta Love Travis,"What more could you want than a compilation of everything from rockin country to beautiful ballads by Travis Tritt? This CD has something to make you want to dance, something to make you smile, something to make you teary...I've seen Travis in concert and have tickets to see him again next month in Bangor (Maine). How many artists bother to come to ""the little towns?"" Not too many! Travis Tritt is one of a kind..."
1,who listens to this crap?,"What a load of crap! this ugly yank has got the most annoying voice that i have ever heard. If these are are collection of his greatest hits, then i feel soory for those who have got his other albums! RULE BRITTANIA GOD SAVE THE QUEEN"
1,Greatest Hits,It never came and I'm awaiting a refund. I was very disappointed as I waited the full 6 weeks. I appreciate the refund.
3,shipment,"why does'nt this ship to australia ???? i'd love to own this one,after ''live and kickin''.can someone let me know , i keep adding it to my cart but have to delete it at the end"
5,I could listen to this CD over and over and never tire of it,Travis Tritt can make a girl cry with his songs and videos. My husband always makes sure i'm there to see his video's to watch me cry. This CD contains two of my favorite videos and songs.
3,mrc-6 dj mixer case,well the item is good strong and sturdy but it is only a case ment to hold your dj equipment
4,The Book helped me be in control and not the disease.,"I found this book extremely helpful to myself and a 17yr old girl who was recently diagnosed. We applied the charts and routines and really payed attention to the information. Any disease can gain control of you if you let it. I have a history of chronic heart disease and have learned that there is more to controlling a disease and recognizing how is the beginning. For this book to be helpful you must be open minded and really listen to the message and be honest with yourself in order to get control of the disease. But I can guarantee anyone with the disease if you apply this book thoroughly it will make all the difference in the world. My doctor read the book in order to help treat me and that helped even more. We are only in the beginning of understanding this disease so don't expect your family and friends to know or understand it, most doctors don't consider it unless there is nothing else to call it. But it's real and debilitating. Try It!"
1,Authors need to be more educated about disabling effects,"This book had some very wrong messages in it, the authors are uneducated. (FMS can be mild, moderate, or severe, everyone is not at the same level) Some people have incapacating pain, and this book implied that if you do, ""you're just giving into it"", or, ""you need to find other ways of dealing with your pain besides laying in bed"" Unfortunately, people who don't have FMS pick these books up and read them, thus giving a bad message about the ones who have severe fibromyalgia"
1,"Keep Looking, there's better books to spend your money on","I read this book and it has a title you can trust but it told me everything I already know and the rest wasn't worth the time. Don't waste your hard earned money on this thing, there are far better books/authors you could buy from on this topic. Keep searching, I hear Nelson Pub. is publishing some new ones very soon on this subject matter that I've heard are really great... might want to keep an eye out for those before making any purchases, I wish I had."
2,"Poor dog, shameful human!","I read this book and wept at the bravery and sacrifice of Scott Shields dog, Bear. But after hearing that the story was one of mostly made up facts, I can only justify giving this book this rating. Shame on you Scott Shields for sacrificing your ""beloved"" Bear for your own personal gain."
1,Read the Real Story,[...] Read here for a comprehensive account of Scott Shields the fraud who is still living in his made up hero world in 2013. Agencies shown on his facebook page might want to google this guy and read how he went to jail for fraud. Do not give this man your money
1,This book does NOT tell what really went on down at ground zero,"This book is NOT True at all. The guy in this book tells of tales of all these great things that never really happened. Scott Shields is not even a real captain of any kind. It is a book of fiction. I worked down at WTC, and this guy was never around. Like the saying goes, ""don't believe everything you read"" or in this case....Don't support this book by buying it."
1,This book doesn't make sense,"When I read this book, I had a hard time understanding why Mr. Shields was considered to be such a hero. He subjected his elderly, untrained, 11-year old dog to the one of the worst disaster sites in history. It is sadly ironic that Shields essentially killed his trusting old dog in order to find dead people (who would have been located at some point anyhow during the recovery process). Additionally, as a search and rescue professional myself, I know untrained responders are a liability in any search, regardless of the size and situation. Not only might they become ""victims"" themselves, they run the risk of putting trained rescuers in danger. I feel this book encourages this type of response, and at the same time represents someone as a hero who clearly is not. If you are interested in reading a book about real search and rescue dogs and their efforts at the WTC, do not consider purchasing this one."
1,Book by the Captain of Fraud,"Book about a poor dog who had the unfortunate luck of being owned by a big fraud. Scott Shields was found guilty of fraud for receiving funds for 9/11 victims and workers, grossly exaggerating his time at 9/11. I met this man in Katrina, and must say he is an incredibly delusional, self absorbed, and pathological liar. Don't buy this book, its based on fiction and not factual events."
1,Convicted of FRAUD & dropped by publisher for lies,This book is a total lie. The author was convicted in federal court of fraud relating to 9/11 and the co-author who was also misled by Scott's lies later regretted her participation in the book. The publisher withdrew this book from publication.See here: [...]
4,great album,while not as good as god was created in my opinion its still a great album. by your bedside is my favorite track from the album. anyway great album i would reccomend it.
1,100% POSER DEATH METAL!!!,"In the early 90's there were hundreds of great bands playing death metal. Now, in 2004, we have bands like VEHEMENCE. What went wrong you ask? Listen to this band and find out why....Pure garbage that Metal Blade Records is trying to stuff down the throats of the younger fans who don't know the real roots of this music. Listen kids, buy anything from MASSACRE, GRAVE, IMPETIGO, REPULSION, PESTILENCE, ASPHYX, IMPALED, ENGORGED, DEATH(Scream Bloody Gore), and find some old zines and educate yourself on what real death metal is all about."
5,Timely and Insightful,"This book provides an excellent perspective on how the markets work over the long term and demonstrates that nothing happening now is really new or unique. The book is particularly valuable because it was written before the current crisis, and yet it deals explicitly with this exact kind of crisis, and provides excellent historical perspective. It would be a bargain at twice the price."
4,Common Sense Approach to Investing,"I find this book informative, candid and very refreshing. The author is able to apply his broad expertise not only in analysing past events affecting world markets, but is able to project himself and the reader forward into possible future scenarios in the world markets. His premise is that future financial growth will be found in Asia, particularly China, with the USA and Europe lagging behind. His insight is useful to those who wish to position themselves early into an expansionary wave of financial profits. The information is based on sound research, uncommon knowledge, and a huge dose of common sense. This book is well worth the time it takes to read and the money it costs to purchase. Enjoy and learn!!!"
5,This author has been proven correct,I purchased this book shortly after it was published in 2002. The author has been correct in his advice to date (Dec 2006) and I believe will be proven right for years to come. It is a rare opportunity to find a book that so clearly lays out the future and helps you make great investment ideas and actually has recent history to see if the author has provided good advice.
5,Great book about global investing,"Faber, a pioneer in study global business cycles, successfully predicted many ups and downs of different markets in the world since the 80s. In this book written in 2002, he predicted the rising of China, and the booming of commodities due to the rising demand from China, India and other Asian countries. Years later, his prediction again has been proved to be correct. An insightful book about global investing."
2,The book is outdated.,"The book is completely outdated and the author though a respected one, doesnt even bother to update it while bringing out his so called newer editions. Not expected of Marc Faber."
5,unique and insightful,Dr Faber is an absolute genius not so much because he has a unique vision and the courage to think apart from the crowd but his overall perception to investing and life.
4,history or prophecy ?,"Once you make it past a rather lame device at the beginning, the book really takes off. There are valid points in the beginning, so stick with it. Your reward will be a history lesson that could be repackaged and sold as current investment advice."
5,Investment Professional,This is the best investment book that I have ever read. Faber's only fault is sometimes being early in his predictions. Reading this book enables one to see a viewpoint that is drastically different from jingoistic American cheerleaders entirely focused on the U.S. economy.
2,Tomorrows gold,"This book is outdated. Some chapters dont suffer from this fact, while most of them do."
3,Some good ideas hiding in a lot of useless junk,"This book contains some good ideas about investing, and has a long-term perspective that is more valuable than the perspective of many investment books. But it is not a very carefully written book. Much of the history that it includes seems like a tedious recitation of names and dates that are of marginal relevance to understanding financial markets. Many of the charts are less informative than they should be, for example using a linear y-axis when any experienced trader would know that they should be shown with a logarithmic y-axis."
3,still a fan,"I am a big fan of Martha Grimes. I bought this book right away and saved it in anticipation. I wouldn't say I was disappointed with the stories but saddened for the women featured. The second story in particular, I felt to be clever and intriguing (I kept imagining something truly dastardly to take place.) There was just the right amount of suspense. The first, of which the book gets its title) was monotonous... and I am still puzzling over the heroine's reaction at the very end. Indeed I am still wondering why there were so many lunches involved? This does not detract from my admiration of M. Grimes and I can't wait to read her next endeavor."
5,Ditto!,"The previous reviewers said it all; this book is great! I used it with my Honors Social Studies and Language Arts class, and you could have heard a pin drop! Well done, Sally Crum!"
2,Enough please,This show has got to end sometime (thank god)! I watched it for 3 weeks straight and found it rather......how do I put this?......bad. I also listened to samples and can't say much for them either. That's pretty much it.Whatsa matter? Nothing better to do than look at dumb reviews on your PC? Sad.
3,both friends soundtracks,"i was looking to purshase both friends soundtracks, friends and friends again, therefore i read the song lists for both of them. I was disappointed to see that THE Ross and Rachel song, U2 With or Without you was not on either nor was Joey and Chandler's song All by Myself. The last song in the first series, from the episidode The One Where Rachel Finds Out was not on there either. As i am a huge friends fan i looked up the song which plays while Ross and Rachel kiss in Central Perk in The One Where Ross Finds Out only to find it is not an actual single. Despite this, it would have been nice to hear it on one of them, as it is one of the highest rated episodes.After listening to the second one, Friends Again, I thought the last 2 songs weren't worthy enough to be on it.After seeing these and reading other reviews, I have decided not to buy either. biggest friends fan ever!"
3,Appropriate for the show,"I bought this CD the week it came out because I like the show, and I heard that R.E.M. and Hootie were on it. The track by Hootie is better, though. Some other good tracks on this album: ""Good Intentions"" by Toad the Wet Sprocket (what happened to them?) ""Sexuality"" by k.d. lang, ""Angel of the Morning"" by the Pretenders, the remix of ""Big Yellow Taxi,"" from Joni Mitchell, and of course, ""I'll Be There for You,"" the show's theme song. Oh, and the dialogue from the show between tracks is hilarious."
4,Friends CD,This CD is a nice collection of songs played during the long running Friends series on TV. The songs are memorable and some are hard to get out of one's head.
5,Good soundtrack,"This soundtrack is good. It is quite good. Since the Friends episode is good, it is good soundtrack with no doubt."
1,as weak as the show!,i can't stand that wack show nobody can act.but to top it all off is this lame CD.only Joni Mtichell's Big Yellow taxi is a must hear.the rest of this junk is MILKTOASTY! no Rhythm whatsoever.boring&LAme.
4,Bojack is unbound,"This is how I rated this movie:Story(3.5 out of 5): Classic Dragonball Z, I liked the tournament setup it makes the world tournament mor important.Visuals(5 out of 5): Slick fights make this as enjoyable as eating fudge.Characters(4.5 out of 5): We have a new classic villan Bojack! And his gangsters Zangya, Gokua, Bido and Bujin.Sound(1.5 out of 5): Nothing a little boring but amps up during the fight scenes.Action(4 out of 5): You have to love classic fights like this one. Its all out brawling style makes this a classic to remember.Villian Deaths(4 out of 5): You gotta' love em'. Super Saiyan 2 Gohan + Bido and Bujin and Bojack = BOOM! Awesome villain death!Overall(4 out of five): Not the greatest DBZ movie but a musy buy."
4,Good DBZ movie,This movie was good wasn't the best movie I have ever seen. But this was good. This movie is mainly about Gohan after he defeated Cell. The best battle is where Gohan turns into his powerful Super Saiyan 2 form and defeats Bojack and his goons.
3,not really worth it.,"I wasn't all that impressed with Bojack Unbound. While many dbz fans would scream murder over this. I'm just saying that this wasn't as good as it should have been. Let's face it, if your going to drop 20 or more on an anime dvd. It had better live up to the hype. Bojack was a throw away villian. Who didn't really seem to have any idea of what he was doing. All he did well was kill his minions. I didn't like this at all and the only good thing about this was future Trunks and Vegita. Not a good reason to buy anything. Unless it's a dvd about them. over all there are far better ways to get your dbz fix. save your money unless you find this really cheap."
2,Not really a nice movie,Hello there dbz fans i've seen this dvd much before it was released in english i saw it in german by polyband this movie has a lame end and no basic point and not some good action. I would reccomend not to buy if you believe me.
3,This Movie doesnt has much of action,"Hello all DBZ Fans I would like to share my thoughts on this dvd for ur benefit, this movie is not exactly that good what was expected from it and i'm sure most of you would have seen it in japanese but I saw it in german and the action was not that good but the story was really good i wanted to see more better kind of action."
3,"Funimation continues their ""streak""","Whaddya know , once again , for absolutely no good reason , Funimation has blown up the majestic widescreen to the craptactular 4:3 pan 'n scan jobby. Why? That's the whole point of the DBZ movies , to seperate them from the show, to make them look big budget. We get another 5.1 English dub , replete with bad dialogue and terrible synth-metal composed by some 12-year pounding on a keyboard. The Japanese track saves with the day along with excellent subtitles. And the usual Funimation product line (promos,commercials,etc...) The movie ""was"" great. If you can pick up the original VHS Japanese widescreen version , skip this DVD. But if you're hard up for some more Funimation DBZ action , you've come to the right place"
2,Another lame cookie-cutter DBZ film,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE DBZ fan, which is exactly why I was so disappointed with this film. You get the typical ""here's the Z Team"" (minus Goku, though) and here are the unstoppable bad guys, the Z Team gets beat, Vegita comes in and gets beat, hero prevails (although the typical Goku is replaced by Gohan in this one in an ending that is exactly like the ending of the Cell Saga). C'mon! This is one of the greatest fighting series ever, get a little original! Make a two-hour feature with a big back-drop story combined with something at least a little unpredictable! There are still a few DBZ movies out there that have yet to come to the US (with at least one really good one that I've seen in Japanese - the one where trunks gets his sword), so I haven't lost all hope, but I fear that this franchise may have ""jumped the shark..."""
4,"Very interesting to play,","As a total novice at playing the harmonica, I ordered this basically out of curiousity. It certainly increased my own enjoyment of the harmonica - per the claims in the description, it adds the option of minor chords so common in various types of ethnic music and A minor (being the ""all white key"" minor scale) is a great tuining to start with.The only minor complaint is that the chord progression for the top holes is a bit hard to get used to - don't know whether this is just this particular instrument or true for A minor tunes in general."
4,Excellent Color Printer for Non Photo Applications. Expensive Toner Cartriages,Great printer for non photo applications. Over a hundred times the prints verses ink jets. Over all the perfect first color laser printer for low to moderate color printing. The toner cartriages are expensive at about $80 each and you need 4 total. There is NO comprehensive on site warranty included with the printer.
5,Brilliant song,"From the winner of American Idol, I came across this single by chance, after everyone fussed about it. She hasn't had any singles released over in the UK yet, but she's probably stabilising her career in the US first. This was written by Christina Aguilera, and it would have been an ideal song for Miss Aguilera, but Kelly's made it her own. If Kelly was to release this song over here, then it would definitely make her well known. Unfortunately, I've never seen her sing live (never got to see American Idol either, although Simon Cowell was as bad as ever!), and the video's pretty basic. Kelly gets to stand around and look pretty. Not a concept that's never been done before. She's done a good job on this song, although you can see in her gestures she's desperately trying to copy the songwriter."
1,Diva Flop,"For Kelly Clarkson, winning American Idol seems to have changed her tone in the industry. It is just so sad I can't say the exact same thing about her music. With her latest, Miss Independent, from Thankful, she seems to have a sound that is too similar to the Christina and Britney Spears copycats, and not really anything on her own style of sound. It is just so sad that it hasn't happened yet, and I really hope that she can change her sound soon."
1,OMG!,"It's priced ridiculously, and when you can download these for free, how could you consider buying it? if your gonna spend this much money for four songs, make sure the money is going to charity or clay aiken or some other noble cause."
3,"It's Ok, but don't expect any weight","This is a nice ring, but do not expect it to feel like it is on your finger. There is no weight to it. The stone has a nice cut and color. If you want a nice heavey ring go with sterling."
2,Not what expected,"As the CD is called ""the best of Vangelis"" I ordered it. But I am sorry for it: it is not what I expected of Vangelis."
4,good video about 11/22/63 and the (local) press,"I received my copy free from 6th Floor guru Gary Mack, but I digress. This is a very good video with some nice quality (B& W) footage, such as the sequence at Love Field depicting Secret Service agent Henry J. Rybka being recalled by Emory P. Roberts, among other clips. The reporter 'roundup' at the end was entertaing, too. Worth having.Vince Palamara"
4,M-Audio IE-20 Ear Monitors,"I am a DJ and I needed something that would go in my ear for events where using regular DJ headphones were cumbersome. Once you get the IE-20 positioned into your ear canal right, the sounds quality is stellar and works great for cueing in a DJ situation.One caveat though, is these earphones don't have a long slinky cord like you'd find on a pair of professional grade headphones. The IE-20 cable isn't very long, it is kinky, and gets tangled easily. If you step slightly away from the decks, you can bet on yanking at least one of the IE-20s out of your ear.The IE-20s come with a carry case which is cool, but is almost too small to pack them in. They also come with several size ear buds, to allow you to make the perfect fit.The sound quality is definetly suitable for even a professional environment."
2,M-Audio IE-10 cords short out,"These in ear buds sound pretty decent but I only owned these for 9 months and under normal use (I'm a drummer and used these as my in ear monitor) the cords shorted out. All the documentation claims that the cords are detachable and replaceable but good luck finding them, they aren't made available. Same thing happened to our guitarists pair as well, his didn't even last as long as mine. $100 ear buds should probably last longer than 8 - 9 months."
3,One of Koontz Worst!,"This book is ok. It does have an interesting plot. The problem with it, is it lacks good suspense. It has no depth in either the story or character development. Another thing is Koontz seems to repeat the same scenerio over and over again. This is one of Koontz worst. Of course this was one of his earlier novels. Koontz impoved as he wrote more. This book is good if you want an easy read, just don't expect to get anything too exciting out of it."
2,not that great,"The best thing I can say about ""Shattered"" is it was a quick read. There were lots of very small things that took away from this book, like characters who were introduced and then simply thrown away. I also agree with other reviewers who said that the ending was too fast and predictable. And another thing, why didn't Alex or Colin contact the police immediately after being attacked in their hotel room? Instead, they continue on their journey to San Francisco, with Alex hoping things would return to""normal"" and ""fun"". Do real people think like this immediately after almost having their heads chopped off?"
1,Clearly written by a novice,"Clearly the work of a novice writer, this book is certainly not at the level of Koontz's later, more mature works. It amazes me that something this bad can be published, and yet so many competent novelists are shunned by major publishers. A travesty, really."
1,Disappointed!,"Talk about anti-cllimatic. I was very disappointed with the story in general. Koontz didn't seem to have his heart in this one. I kept expecting something to happen, but nothing much ever did. I don't expect for the book to necessarily be totally believable, but I found myself saying ""There is no way someone in this situation would have done that."" The ending was very dull. I think the only reason that I finished the book was because I HATE starting a book and not finishing it. This book also reminded me of the other Koontz book I had read - Whispers. It seemed too similar for my tastes and maybe that also took away something for me. I will however continue to give Koontz a chance, because some of his passages are written very well, and are pretty scary. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone I know."
2,"Koontz's older books are usually better, this one is dead","This book is extremely boring and the suspense seemed almost predictable as to what was going to happen (therefore, it's not even suspense!). The ending was downright horrible, as was the rest of the book. If you plan on reading this as your first DK book, then I think you'd probably get a bad impression and never read from him again, even though his other books are superb."
4,Great for a Flight,"Shattered, was probably Koontz's shortest and fastest novel in terms of material I have read. I thought that he was able to keep the story going with little or no lagging. I thought the villian was good, yet there could have been more detail about his angst. I did find the protagonist Alex a decent fellow, who has a cowardly demeanor, who has to pull together to resolve the situation. But this novel will be a great movie, if done right."
3,An enjoyable thriller.,"I enjoyed this book. Not the best book Koontz has written, but still, I had goose bumps while reading this book. Slow at times, yet moves fast other times. Descriptive at times, such as when Leland has his headaches. I could feel the pain as I read the words. An enjoyable, but average thriller."
4,Riveting Tale,"I believe you all are making this book highly under rated...I think that Koontz was a master at this book and this is the first book I have read from him. He still knows how to make a good book even if he is in a dry spell or w/e. The book developed great characteristics for Alex and Colin building a foundation; however, I do believe they needed to elaborate more on the plot about the cops. Overall, this book has great potential of being a superb novel and I recommned it to anyone who likes to read a chilling tale until and hang on to the edge of their bed until the book is over."
2,Shattered Expectations,"This was the first Koontz book I have read and was somewhat disappointed. I did enjoy the rising tension as an unknown person was following Alex and Colin. And the feeling of rejection Alex experienced was an interesting tactic by the author. But there were unresolved subplots, and the ending was somewhat abrupt and predictable. I'll probably read another Koontz book but will seek recommendations first."
3,Early Koontz novel shows that he only got better as time went on,"Not as good as anticipated, but still a solid Koontz novel. It's a fast read and it's early Koontz, copyrighted in 1973, shows that he only got better as time went on.I think the main flaw of this novel is that we know too much about the antagonist too soon, which takes some of the suspense and mystery away. If Koontz had taken this novel and re-wrote it, say, 10-15 years ago, like he did with several other of his early novels, I'm sure he could have turned it into a 5-star effort."
4,not bad,"this is the first DK'S book i've read.but not the first horror book.some passages were scary and the story stood on its legs.BUt the ending was horrible.not scary just predictable.what i did like was when i could feel leland's pain.i could see what he saw. so,you can say it was good,but ""could be better "" thriller"
1,"Short, but hardly sweet","As some other reviewers have already said, this starts okay but steadily deteriorates. No characterisation, no plausible plotline and stupid conflict scenes."
2,Anticlimactic,"This novel started off just fine. I was quite interested in the story and quite anxious to follow it along.The characters were interesting; the plot was quite entertaining and suspenseful. In his usual style, Dean Koontz kept me wondering about what was going to happen.However, the ending was so disappointing. I felt robbed of my time and energy. Maybe I have been spoiled by reading his more recent works first, but the ending left me staring at the page.Definitely not one of Koontz's better novels. He does have many more satisfying works."
4,Short but has the same effect,"Philadelphia to San Francisco you're followed by a van. You lose it, but it returns, How do they know where you're going? An unique villan as only Koontz does it. Yet another Twisted mind that Koontz creates"
4,One of his best early titles,Read it in 2 days. Couldn't put it down. The story of being followed across country on a desolate stretch of highway is terrifying
2,Below Standard,This is the typical crazed killing machine after the heroine and the child. This theme is replayed in quite a number of his books. Read only if you are a true fan.
3,quick read,"typical koontz; pretty slick and effective, not a lot of emotional content (compared to king, for example), fast read. good book for day at the beach or an airline trip."
3,"good ride, weak ending","This is my third Koontz novel, and I continue to be impressed with his overall writing skills. What I am disappointed by is the way he often wraps things up too quickly and wayyy too abruptly. Ex. in this book he sets up a conflict between two Ohio cops who are trying to find the killer, then fails to ever mention them again. It is almost like he worked like mad on this book, got tired and sleepy towards the end, and just said ""[scrap]it,"" wrote a [poor] ending and went to bed. A few pages of epilogue would have helped this book tremendously. What about the Ohio cops and their argument? What really led to the killer conpletely freaking like he did? How will Colin and Alex and Courtney face the future, given what happened with George? These are plot threads that could and should have been wrapped up more neatly than they were. All in all, a good read that could have been much better with just a little more effort."
4,Good basic weather radio,"This radio works fine for me. I seem to have a strong signal in my area. The radio indicates signal strength, but it doesn't seem to work well, it either shows full strength or zero, even though it's capable of displaying several intermediate levels. Regardless of the indicated signal strength I can hear the weather statements and receive alarms/alerts with no problem.The LCD display has a pretty limited viewing angle, you have to hold it at just the right angle to view it well.You can't turn off alerts, they time out on their own. I'm not sure how long it takes, but it's many hours. It gets a bit old seeing the Wednesday test scroll across the screen over and over.The rechargeable batteries last 2 or 3 days, with the radio in standby most of the time, and a few minutes of listening to the radio each day. For a trip of any length you will need to bring the charger or switch to regular batteries.These are minor issues, overall I'm happy with it."
1,Bad customer service Wont work in rural area's,"I purchaced this weather radio for my sons christmas present, we set it up for our county and it would not alarm for any of the weather warnings we had for the three or four day's after christmas here in Michigan. I called the tech support and they confirmed all the settings were correctly inputed for our area and was told it would probably start working eventually!. I asked them what I needed to do to send it to them for a exchange and they paused and said ""dont send it here, It will take months before you will see it back, Just send it back to amazon""They where rude on the phone, I was on hold for a long time and you could tell that they are having many problems with this unit. I did send it back to Amazon and promptly recieved my refund."
1,Waste of Money!,I have had this radio for one year now. It worked marginally for about 6 months. The 1000 watt transmission tower is 15 miles away. The product claims reception up to 50 miles. It could only pick up the channel randomly while signal indicator showed a strong signal. It does not work at all now. Signal indicator still says it is a strong signal. Waste of money. I will never purchase a Oregon Scientific product again.
1,Close to a tower and no reception,I bought this product and after trying over and over how to programthis thing I have like 0 reception and I live like 4 miles from the tower.It's hard to program in Canada because you have to enter all the infosby hand and at the end it's not working 0 reception. I had it for over amonth and I've never heard the warning signal once.
1,Poor escuse for a weather. Radio,"Oregon scientific weather radioOregon Scientific WR602 Portable Emergency Public Alert RadioIs so much worse than the previous model it's hard to believe that they are from the same manufactur. Will not receive a signal from a station 23 miles away, nor from the NOAA site in Tulsa . If you live in an area with tornado potential don't buy this one."
3,Reset Button Won't Work,"Reset button won't work after a few tries. About 1 / 8th inch in size, sank down to where it won't work."
2,OK except for one thing.,"This receiver works well and is not too complicated to program and set up. Thats a good thing because you will have to program it and set it up often. The battery life between charges is not that great. I would leave mine in the charging cradle most of the time and most of the time it would get bumped and fall out of the cradle. The cradle is poorly designed, the radio rests in it and is not secure in any way. When the radio dislodges in the cradle and the battery dies it loses all programming. When you go to use it you have to charge it a little and re-program all settings back in. I finally stopped using it and got a Midland which retains all memory setting even if the batteries are dead and it uses AA batteries. A weather emergency radio with rechargeable batteries is dumb when you have no power for three days."
4,Weather Radio,"The only complaint is the speaker is not loud enough for me to hear, when turned up full blast. After reading the setup instructions, at my advanced age, I called my son and told him to come by and set it up for me, when he had time. Other than that, I would rate the little radio a good buy."
4,good product!,This is probably one of the best NOAA weather radios. What I really liked about it is that all of the counties in the US and other US islands are already programed into it so that you dont have to enter a S.A.M.E code. This is a pretty good product overall!
1,broken immediately,"I had this product less than a month before it completely died. Charge light on, but absolutely nothing on the screen. Complete defect. Garbage and a waste of time and money."
5,Weather Radio,"The company I bought it from would not contact me after I had a problem with the radio so I ended up contacting the make for a replacement, which they did with no problem. Everything is okay with the radio now. Be carefull who you buy from on the internet."
3,not good in the mountains,"I live in the mountains in a rural area and I only receive one station that is the next county over. I was able to set it up myself, and I am not good at electronic devices so that was pretty amazing; the directions are good. I might call the company and see if they can help me find another radio channel that is closer to where I live. I did take it hiking and it fit nicely in my raincoat pocket and it was nice to have it just-in-case.May 16, 2010 - I have really gotten a lot of use from this little weather radio - during very bad storms I sleep with it next to my bed - it has been extremely helpful!"
3,"Works great, but see new comments",this radio is working great so far. no issues and im getting all the info i need with no problems. Even went off for an evacuation done for a fire north of me. Great unit but the only down fall is the directions. They need to explain things better in this unit.****UPDATE 2/3/10**** I have been having some issued with the alert not going off for some flood warnings we have experinced this winter. It will go off for the weekly test and that is it. I have contacted the company and worked with them to resolve the issue. They are going to be replacing my unit in a few days.
1,Nice features - horrible reception,"Nice feature set - it's the reason why I bought it a while back. Indoor/outdoor temp and humidity, FIPS programming, automatic channel selection, large display and nightlight.Too bad the RF quality is horrendous. I live within reception of 3 different NOAA stations in the DFW area (south end of tornado alley), but can barely get reception to one of them. The unit has to be placed near a window, which is highly inconvenient. The kicker is that the charging base itself creates alot of interference. Test engineers - you FAILED."
1,"Worked well for five months, but then.....","We bought this based on positive user reviews.The WR602 worked really well for five months+. Then, we no longer received weekly emergency Alert tests nor the 24/7 radio weather broadcasts. The LED indicator went blank and showed ""weak battery"" although it had ONLY been used in the charge cradle. If we removed it from charger to reset and reprogram it, as soon is it is replaced back into charger, the screen blinked and lost the settings. If we removed the ""rechargable"" batteries and simply left it in cradle to reprogram it, the 24/7 radio worked, but still no emergency Alert signal.UPDATE: As a ""work-around"" -- after removing batteries I placed the radio (rubber-banded) into the charger cradle for a solid fit, then RESET everything, while it sat in the charger/cradle. With rechargable batteries & cord completely removed, it now works well as a (non-portable) weather radio and ""alerts""."
1,can not get it to work!,"My borhter has a similar one, obvioulsy his is a lot better than this things. It is very confusing to set up!...nto as easy as they make it out to be....we have tried it for 2 seasons now and still not working right!"
1,it is not actually rose gold!,"In the item description, this watch is supposed to be rose gold. I ordered it, and when it arrived, it was yellow gold. I won't even get into the details of how amazon took 3 months to issue credit to my card after they received the return."
4,Most of what you need to know to prepare for & following a diaster,"I have a copy of this book in my disaster ""GO"" bag & car glove compartment. As a retired emergency manager, I was so impressed with this book, that I ordered 250-copies for employees, prior to my retirement. This book, Red Cross 1st aid & preparedness materials, & ""Chronicals of Katrina"", gives the best information regarding how to prepare for disasters, & additionally, necessary information on how to begin the road to recovery, post-disaster. Many Red Cross materials are free, & the 2-books mentioned, offer the best value for the information you need to prepare, respond & recover from a disaster. susanf"
5,Unbelievably Helpful !,"There is a lot of information in this book. The information it has provided my family and friends has been indespensible. We have referred to this book countless times for a variety of reasons. It has helped us in gathering and organizing important documents and helped us in developing a family plan for emergencies (we have hurricanes here). Everyone knows what to do in the event of an emergency, particularly in situations where we may not be together. We established where to go and how to stay in contact with each other - especially useful when phones may be out. We have given books as presents and I understand that it can be used in fund raisers. Man I wish some organizations would sell something like this - something that is actually useful ! Everyone should have a copy of ""It's a Disaster"""
2,Made her poop soft,"I was previously feeding Purina Pro to my Siberian Husky puppy, which was fine and she had no problems with it, but I really wanted to feed her something more high grade so I asked the Petsmart employee what he recommended. He highly suggested the Blue Buffalo brand which I looked into. The ingredients seem legit because there's a lot of healthy stuff in it, but perhaps it's too much carbs or fiber because it made my puppies stool super soft, mushy, and smelly. I read a great article about how to find the best dog food for your pup - [...]. I think I'm going to try Innova or Canidae next. Crossing fingers that it will fare better than Blue Buffalo!! I probably won't be purchasing anymore dog food from Petsmart from here on out."
5,Great!,"My pup crapped his guts out for at least 2 weeks, but he's only 8weeks so it was expected. Regardless he enjoys the heck out of this stuff, and I don't even use treats to train him! He just mows down on this stuff instead."
3,some great songs and some not so great,"There are some that were great hip hop songs. I didn't care for a few of the rap songs. Overall, it was a good CD."
4,Very nice...,"I bought this for my wife, who wouldn't buy if for herself. I was a little apprehensive at first but when she tried it on she really liked it; and for me, well let's just say it didn't disappoint me in any way ;).She has worn it under a dress and feels very comfortable in it now; however, with time there developed a run in the material. So now it's just used in the bedroom. I will contemplate getting a second one."
4,Remember this one..,"I remember recording this record with our mutual producer Michael Baker. Had alot of fun doing it. Shortly after, I was signed to RCA and wound up guest singing at one of their shows in my Dad's hometown - it was The Hammersmith Odeon in Hammersmith (London) England. I was over there, writing my first album. Cheers, Dr. Robert!"
2,Too big for my turntable,My Denon turntable has a large automatic needle arm that moves over the LP. The arm would not clear the large ( tall) adaptor. Otherwise it would have worked fine.
1,Highway robbery for $2 a novelty item,"These could be very cool shades if they made them out of quality materials instead of the brittle plastic and poorly tinted frames used. Don't get me wrong, it would have made my day if I found these for (...) at a novelty store - however I paid (...) plus shipping at Amazon.com, doh."
4,"Good,Average\Quick ending",Good book with some nice pieces of suspence but the ending is far to quick and they should mention at least a page of what happens with Sarah+Riley and Maggie+Donal
4,Old favorite,"I've loved this book for a while now, and whilst being the epitome of my reading habits, my recent rereading of it has brought me to the conclusion that it's actually not that good as it was.Though it left me guessing as always, the ending and ""plot twist"" of Shane's past was rather disappointing. I still love this book, and it will always be one of my favorites."
4,Great for general use and birding,"This was a great purchase for my purposes - birding and wildlifing. I had to get used to turning the center-focus with ring finger, as the zoom lever is in the index-finger position. To use full zoom, you really need total stability, but half zoom is very useful even from a moving kayak. Right-eye focus ring is right up against the eyecups and hard to move unless you twist open the eyecups, in which case the focus ring is fine. Focus crispness is not quite what I hoped for at full zoom, but still good for seeing field marks. One big advantage is the light weight. This set is as light as the smaller Nikon I lost. Very nice!"
5,Most Excellent Book on Both Family Line History and French/English/ColonialU.S./U.S. and Southern History,"I have wanted this book for many years and am delighted that I now have it. Certainly valuable for those related to any of the family lines on the title, but also for those interested in history (suggested in the Subject Line). Outstanding scholarship and writing - thoroughly researched, documented and well written."
2,Off it came after the second shot,"I purchased this product to use on a Beretta Xtrema 2 shotgun. The sight seemed to fit tight and have plenty of magnets (2) to hold it onto the ventilated rib of the gun. I shot a duck on my first shot and the sight stayed on. After shooting a duck on my second shot, I looked down and saw that the sight was not on the gun. Luckily, I found the sight laying on the ice behind me. I then taped it on the gun and it stayed for the rest of the day. I liked the sight picture but the magnets alone will not hold it on the gun. This is the second Hi Viz product that I have tried without the promised results."
2,Terrible picture,I give it two stars because it's a great movie and very hard to get. But the picture deserves 1 star.
1,Poor Quality VHS,"Having read the poor reviews on the DVD quality of this movie, I ordered the VHS version. Unfortunately the quality of the VHS is so bad I could not watch the movie. Amazon should withdraw this terrible product by ""Star Classics"". Don't waste your money."
3,Amazing event portrayed in not such an amazing film,The raid of Entebbe became famous as a very successful strike against an act of terrorism. Israeli soldiers did an amazing thing when they managed to fly to Uganda and save 100 hostages.I must admit I am a little bit disappointed with this film. I feel that such an exciting story and outstanding deed could have been portrayed in a much better way.I feel that the film seldom touches a nerve and that it becomes a little bit dull.
2,Raid On Entebbe,"very very poor quality. This was not the original movie version. It looked like it was pirated off of a television program, sections of the film were left out. The reproduction was so dark at times it was impossible to distinquish the faces of the actors. All that could be seen clearly was the white bands on the hats the soldiers worn...looked like white stripes moving around on the screen. I was expecting the full complete version of ""RAID ON ENTEBBE"". Instead I get something downloaded off the television by a Canadian company. There were sections of fading to black periodically through out the film. These were the halts for commercials apparently. It was chopped up and some scenes and dialogue were cut out. I was so dissapointed I can not find the right words to let you know how angry I am."
3,The film - and the DVD.,"I remember seeing this film years ago and was pleased to find it available on DVD. However, after reading all the horrible reviews here (and elsewhere), I decided to see if I could rent it first. One store in my area specializes in hard-to-find DVDs. And, they had it for rent.THE FILM: 5 out of 5 stars. This is much better than the ""Victory At Entebbe"" film that came out at roughly the same time. The acting is solid and the action was believable and riveting.THE DVD: 0 out of 5 stars. I couldn't believe how awful the transfer was until I saw it for myself. I'm still trying to figure out why the transfer team put in that black bar at the bottom of the frame. If anyone knows why, let me know.THE BOTTOM LINE: If you can brave a crappy film-to-DVD transfer, I still think you'll find the film worthwhile watching.P.S. One final theory (tongue-in-cheek). The team that transferred this film to DVD must have been under the direction of an angry Palestinian (grin)."
3,"Excellent movie, Bad DVD!","I completely agree with the last reviewer in Feb-09.All in all, Excellent movie! Bad DVD! It says it is digitally re-mastered, but it is still BAD DVD!I will avoid all products of WHAM!USA in the future."
1,Terrible Quality DVD,"There must be two versions of this dvd. I ordered one from an Amazon Marketplace seller that was supposed to be this version. However, they sent me a version by WHAM!USA. This version has terrible quality. The advertisement for this dvd says it is 150 minutes in length. But the WHAM!USA version is 113 minutes in length. Plus, the dvd cover is different from the one in the Amazon ad. I haven't seen the 150 minute version, but run far away from this version."
3,"""Raid On Entebbe""","""Raid On Entebbe"" is a five star which has become a three star because of the poor quality of the film transfer. Obviously, no one took the trouble to remaster it and it shows. One can scarcely see the people in some scenes, others are so dark that only outlines of persons remain. Even the overall ""quality"" of the image looks a bit like it's been tracked through someone's dust bin first. It's a crying shame because this is a beautifully acted, well directed, nicely photographed story of real events that holds up with time ... I ought to know, I worked on the film as an Assistant Director and saw it all first hand."
1,Raid on Entebbe,Fine movie - DVD WAS FOUND DAMAGED when I opened it-! -& the option to return it IS NOT RESPONDING-!!
2,Poor quality,"So dark, I could hardly see the movie. Too bad. It was just a very bad production of a very important film."
2,Not as good as the book 90 mnts at entebbe,"The movie was not as good as the book ""90 mnts at Entebbe"". The picture quality was very ordinary. Looked like a low budget film. Was a bit disappointing."
4,amazing,"it's a great film, because the history has been so great.thank to them for how i felt viewing the film."
3,Good guys vs. bad guys,"This is a pretty good DVD but it has ""Made For TV"" all over it. Much of it was heavily edited and the style of the time is definitely 1970s LA but still pretty good.The Entebbe Raid was an incredible act of courage and audacity which saw the rescue of most of the Israelis who were singled out after an airliner was hijacked. The Israeli Defense Forces flew right into the heart of Africa, into the fiefdom of Idi Amin Dada, to get the hostages out."
1,Record this movie off of TV. It will be better.,"I like the movie and was hoping the DVD would be a good purchase. Unfortunately the DVD is the worst quality DVD I have ever seen. It's not even DVD quality. Regular TV broadcasts coming through my DirecTV signal are much sharper than this low quality piece of junk. The picture quality is very dark. I have seen this movie on TV and the darkness of the picture is very noticable. Even worse is that the makers of the DVD cut out complete scenes of the movie! The one star rating is not for the movie itself, but for the extremely bad job done to make this DVD. It sucks! Don't buy it! Record the movie off of TV and then have someone record it onto a DVD for you. It will be much better"
2,2007 edition is terrible,"Raid on Entebbe is a tightly directed film that portrays one of Israel's finest hours - it is a tense story of incredible danger, and heroic rescue. Unfortunately, the 2007 edition is like watching a 1960's television set with terrible reception. Amazon should not sell this version at any price."
3,Excellent collection,If you are a mel fan like me then you will appreciate this collection. I wish that they had come out with this collection before we had to pay for all the singles over time. Mel had several version of his hits and this collection has many of my favorites.
4,When it's good it is great...,"Lee Oskar harmonicas are not available where I live. I order this one and spent about three weeks in anticipation. It arrived - for the first time, I could play tunes in a minor key on a diatonic. Wow!After one day, the five draw was blown out - or so I thought. I was so angry, I wrote a review complaining.Well, I guess I don't know much about harmonicas. The reed was stuck, but I just had to clean the harmonica, and it was working again. It still tends to get stuck very easily - when I'm playing, I always have a nagging doubt at the back of my mind. But it didn't reserve the bad review I gave it before. Puttin' On The Ritz, The Battle of Jericho and many others have now been added to my repetoire."
4,F-18 by Revell,I purchased this product for my 13 year old grandson and he was definitely liking it when he opened it up on Christmas day.
5,Everyone needs this book!!!,"Most poignant approach to praying for the unsaved I have ever read! This should be taught to every Christian to help with evangelism. Praying for the lost has become an afterthought, a truly lost art"
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"When I read Dark Ruby, I couldnt put it down! The dialouge takes you back in time, the romance is juicy and sizzling, the plots have you sitting on the end and wanting more, this book is a real page turner!"
2,raises the TSTL bar,"I just couldn't get over the premise of this book. The heroine's married to an evil man who's killed his last two wives because they didn't give him sons.The hero's a thief who's hiding in her room while the midwife gives her a gyn exam to see if she's pregnant yet. She's not. She demands the thief get her pregnant to save her life, otherwise she'll turn him in & he'll lose his hands if not his life... and it turns out she's a virgin.*bashing my head repeatedly on the desk* How stupid is this heroine? Talk about TSTL--this takes the cake.The hero's not all that great, either. Once he returns to claim his son, he despises her for making compromises to save his son's life. I guess these two morons deserve each other, not that I could see any reason for them to fall in lurrve other than the hot nookie 12 years earlier which she forced on him."
5,"Very good book, a few flaws.","See my review for Streetlethal. The same review could apply here, except the ending of this book really did not seem believable. I think the main characters got a little overly lucky considering the situation they were in when the book ended"
5,excellent book by steven barnes,"I found this book better than the first of the series in dealing with race, class, and gender. It also manages to kick serious butt like Streetlethal."
3,Sturdy watch with flimsy band,"I gave this watch 3 stars, although the watch itself earns five and the strap earns one. I bought this watch for my husband two years ago, and the strap keeps breaking. My husband isn't subjecting the watch to any special punishment, just regular wear. The watch itself is lovely, and my husband loves it, but it's too much hassle getting a replacement band every 8 months or so, and I'm online now shopping for a replacement."
5,New Era AOR,"101 South is made up of ex Harlan Cage Members. They are similar in style to Bad Company (Brian Howe years) & Journey. They formed in 2000 and this CD came out around 2002. This is part of a modern day AOR era. They have strong songs, great hooks & superb musicianship. If you are a fan of Journey, Bad English, Alias, The Storm and Bad Company this CD is for you."
4,Saharan guitar further defined,"Excellent field recording of Saharan guitar (crickets included). Different modal frameworks, that I was unaware of, are explained in the insert notes. Some times, it almost reminds me of Robby Krieger, (of the Doors). I am a fan of Saharan music, and this recording is well worth the purchase."
2,Uninspired and not really worth your time,"Hard as I try, I don't find myself liking this album. Nothing is terrible about it but nothing is great either. Just more cliched, run-of-the-mill fem-fronted goth rock devoid of any innovation or originality. Rheas Obsession, Alas, Leaves Eyes, Arise From Thorns, Brave, Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, Dreams Of Sanity, Autumns Grey Solace, Beseech and Antimatter are all bands that do this so much better. Delight is proof that unknown doesn't necassarily equal good. Many bands, even mainstream ones, offer more for your cash than this album."
2,Improve Your Customer Service,"I ordered this t-shirt, along with 2 others. The price was decent, $18plus ea., the shipping was outrageous (but it was express)anyhow, if you calculated the 3, the t-shirts came to about $21ea. not bad. BUT, we never recv'd this shirt and the invoice stated 't-shirt canceled per our request' well we never requested that and there is no correspondence to this effect. I believe it was just out of stock.So, we ended up paying est. $36.00 for ea. t-shirt. Hell with all the information we are requested to provide someone could have called us to ask if we wanted to replace the shirt with another one.The other two arrive just FinE!"
4,Mint Asure Fresh Breath Capsules,This product was very helpful with my bad breath problem. I used it a lot before I found this in a drug store and was able to buyit cheaper in the store.
4,it's probably better than reg. mints,well it's hard to tell if it works..but i believe that it does.though it's so expensive ..i don't use it every day..
5,Nothing works on Garlic breath EXCEPT THIS,The title of my review says it all. Pasta with fresh garlic and oil? Anchovies and capers? Chili dogs with onions?Mint Assure and Breath Assure are the only products (and I've tried them all) that truly eliminate bad breath
2,High hopes - Disappointed,"I purchased this product hoping for a replacement to the sugarless gum I chew all day long. My bad breath problems originate in the throat/stomach area, so this product promised a better fix than gum alone. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I didn't notice any difference using this product. The minty coating is nice at first, but I definitely still need gum to mask my breath."
2,Display does not work,"Since the first month, the hundredth digit of the yardage reading was pretty light compared to the other digits (as if the tenth and one's digits were in 'bold', but not the hundredth digit). After less than 100 readings, now the hundredth digit is invisible when displaying a '1' (115 yards shows as 15 yards). I tried 2 new batteries, and the problem exists."
4,loving it,Great when it is not windy. I like the fact that you can get yardage to the flag as opposed to just the middle or front of green with gps type devices. May be nice to have both gps and this for the complete experience.:)
4,Bushnell Pinseeker w/slope,"Excellent product, but does require a steady hand at more than 125 yards from the flag due to 7 power optics. Have verified the distances shown using friends GPS units and found that it is most accurate."
3,Beware-this is not tournament legal,"The Pinseeker Tournament Edition is the yardage pro you want to purchase. This yardage pro has slope and is therefore not legal to use for tournament play. Unfortunately Amazon does not list this in the description so I had to return it and of course they charged me shipping to return it. When I ordered it I was given free shipping, but because I returned it Amazon then charged for shipping it to me. Because Amazon failed to describe this product fully I was charged twice for shipping. Beware of purchasing anything from Amazon--I will never shop from them again!!!!"
4,Steady Hand Needed,"I have only used it a few times and like it, especially the slope feature (I'm not a tournament player), but I must point out that it took me a while to learn to steady it enough to get good readings. It still takes me too long to get readings when the flag is more than 200 yds away, especially when there is no wind and when the background is cluttered. Perhaps I will get better results with more use and practice. I play with friends who are low handicappers (I'm not) and who don't waste time on the course. While they ask me for readings when the slope of a hole is great, I usually don't have much time to get readings and keep playing at a steady pace. The instruction manual is too sketchy for my liking."
5,"Can't deside, Sky Caddie/Rangefinder? Pick Rangefinder.","I first tried SkyCaddie, and liked it until slow lock on, short battery life and bad readings started happening more and more often. The laser rangefinder is accurate to within a yard, the battery last a year (its only on for a few seconds per hole and turns itself off. The one advantage SkyCaddie has is yardage to hazards, the end of fairways etc. but is easily worked around with the laser rangefinder, just shot the object (it can distance anything, not just the pin)."
5,Super great product,What a great product. If you like golf you will really enjoy this rangefinder. I have used it for over a month and I don't see myself going out to play without it.
5,Works like a charm!,"I didn't know where to turn. My new HDTV has only one audio out, a coaxial digital. My 5.1 digital receiver has only one in, an optical digital audio in. No one I asked knew anything about this product. I did a google search and came upon this item. You MUST get the correct one, in this case a coaxial to optical, not optical to coaxial. Anyway, I hooked it up, and, VOILA!! Everything works. I did have to push a button on my receiver to make it ""find"" the TV. I also had to do this with my new dvd. GREAT item!"
4,Works like it should,"Product works like it should. AC adapter included, you'll need to have the dcoax and toslink cable. Can't say much more than that."
1,Junk,Didn't work on my audio system at all not even in mono much less stereo. It lit up like it shoud work but would not transmit a signal at all.
4,"After Replacement AC Adapter, It Works Consistently","This product does the trick for me. I'm also using a relatively large TOSLINK cable ( 25ft Toslink Digita ). I'm going from my motherboard's coaxial out into the converter, then out with the 25 ft Toslink into my receiver. The first AC Adapter I received with the converter was buzzing and stuff. The rig worked for about 12 hours, then the AC Adapter stopped buzzing and seized to work after that. I requested a new AC Adapter and Cables To Go sent me one immediately w/ no questions asked. Since I received the AC Adapter I've been living in clover."
1,Doesn't work,"So far usuless, didn't work on any eletronic I have. Tested on dvds, blu-rays, receivers, tv, nothing... maybe I got a defective item."
1,Terrible,I ordered and returned this product TWICE and still did not get a working one. I gave up and payed for a worthless little box. DO NOT BUY!
1,does not work,this product does not convert digital aduio from coaxil source into a optical signal for out put to a sound system. Was using coaxil out on Sony Bravia to optical in on lg sound system.
5,Works as expected with high quality HD audio,Only took a few minutes to hook up to blu ray player and sound bar. Excellent high quality HD audio via optical cable output from coax digital input. Highly recommend the product.
2,Good when it worked,"This product worked well when it finally warmed up. I would not recommend this product. For some reason or another it took about 30minutes or so for it to finally work. I called the interm period its warm up stage. After thirty minutes it worked without a glitch, but who wants to wait that long for something to work?"
5,Exactly what I needed.,So far I have owned this product for about 9 months and it has worked out great. So far it hasn't broken and does what it is supposed to.
5,Awesome!!! Worked as described!!,I would definitely recommend this product to anyone expieriencing conversion of your surround sound system! quick connect and ready to go!
2,Make sure this is what you need!,Works great for watching movie trailers before the actual movie starts. Once the dts audio kicks in the adaptor no longer works. No sound output. :( I think that fact should have been listed in the item description before purchased.
4,A beautiful jigsaw,This a beautiful puzzle of intermediate difficulty. The pieces are well cut and fit well. I enjoyed working it.
1,Formulas get in the way of revelation,"Kay Arthur's inductive methods seriously hampered my spiritual growth. Her formulaic methods kept me from trusting what God was really saying to me through scriptural study - when I went to a Kay Arthur seminar on inductive study, I was actually asked to leave when I started to ask questions about what I understood passages to say. It was a serious blow to me, and it took a long time to trust my time in study with God again. I have since graduated from seminary with an emphasis on Biblical Interpretation and write well-received commentaries. I would highly caution against such a formulaic approach to study which does not allow the imput of the Holy Spirit in understanding."
2,Dissapointing.,"I once heard an instrumental work of Bill Millers on the radio, and it was magnificent, so I was very dissapointed when I bought this cd and heard music completly different from what I expected. I strongly recommend finding some samples of this music before actually buying it."
2,It wasn't really as helpful as I thought,"I've found some better ideas myself to do daily. I really didn't care much for this book, it bored me. I wouldn't recommend it as a beginning book, it's more of a resource than anything."
2,Waste of Time...,"This is the first Dunwich book I've ever read, and I'm not sure I'll be picking up another one. My main problem with this book is the bibliography. She cites her own works and very few others. Where does she get her info? I have no idea. The spells were silly and a lot of her writing was very fluffy and not that original. Save your money on this one, if you have to spend more than a buck, it's too much!"
3,"It was ok but most of the info, I could get off the internet","It was an ok book for a beginner with no internet access but I'm a beginner and surprisingly, i allready knew most of the stuff in the book. I would reccomend checking this book out in the library before buying it. it had a few interesting rituals and articles that I jotted down in my B.O.S. before returning it to the library. All in all, I'm kind of glad I didn't buy it."
2,Pointless and badly written,"Another Dunwich book. And typical of her books, too. Written at about a sixth-grade reading level, contains speculation phrased as fact, and makes her usual sweeping ethical generalizations. If you want to be laughed out of the Wiccan or occult community, read Dunwich and follow her closely. It's the best way I can think of to make yourself look like an idiot."
5,"Burn, Burn, Burn","Everything Larry Goldings, Peter Bernstein, and Bill Stewart do is wonderful: when they're in a room together it's just as good as it gets, every time. No exception here."
2,Not comprehensive enough,"Unless the authors are planning to do a book on Brooklyn New Yorkers, I am disappointed not to see text on my grandfather, George E. Wibecan, who was a noted activist and politician in Brooklyn from the turn of the century until his death in 1946. Materials and photographs are available at the Schomberg Library. I wanted to purchase this book for my family members. But when I realized that George Wibecan was omitted, I quickly changed my mind about its value to black families from outside Manhattan."
4,essential for Gulf War erudition,"The book is written by a respected US Gov Official. He has nothing to gain from writing this book but the contentment of disseminating the reality of US involvement in the middle east. Since writing the book, he has been chastised for being unpatriotic and even anti-semitic - all these reaction being confirmations of guilt. There is little subjectivity in this book - in fact it is not invigorating. Rather, Clark works through hard fact, in an appropriate level of detail, to describe just how misled the general public can be about war, and the incredible effects of sensationalist media and gov propaganda on the collective opinion. Read It."
4,No doc,"Received the item, and also purchased a ski / snowboard vise to use for waxing skis. Item looks very portable and assembled quickly and easily, except it came with no documentation or information. Two extra rods and a few bolts and a wingnut were included but it's not obvious their use or how to attach. I will attempt to get more information on the Internet and to attach the vise. Will update this review later."
4,Two good songs,"I gave this four stars just for the 1st song: ""God Blessed Texas"". The only other one I really enjoyed was ""Kick A Little"". There was nothing really wrong with the rest of the songs, they were just a little bit blah. I bought the CD for the two songs mentioned, and was satisfied with the purchase."
5,bruno magli does it again,"Great fitting sandal, true to size, very comfortable even after many hours of walking on the Italian cobblestones."
5,Quit simply my favorite disk of all time...,"Trace is my favorite disk EVER. I can put it away for a week, or a month, pull it out, and never get sick of listening to it. I hope Jay and Co. never get too popular, so they will always stay true to their sound."
5,High Point for Farrar,"This amazing album keeps going. Every song conjurs up late night highway driving and decaying urban fabric. Soulful music throughout without a bad song on the entire ablum. Farrar rocks out and can keep it mello too. This is a staple for any Alt-Country fan.I'm not quite as impressed by the other 2 SV albums, so start here."
5,One listen and your hooked,"A marvelous albumn. This chunk of ear candy will be tough to top. The volters certainly didn't do it with ""Straightaways"" which was the follow-up to this gem. Perhaps it's too early to tell on their latest ""Wide swing tremelo"". However they do seem to be back on track. Trace offers much to it's listeners with a wide aray of styles. The boys never stray to far from the core sound which was established by frontman Jay Farrar and Wilco's Jeff Tweedy. The pair were the founders of the now defunct and highly missed Uncle Tupelo. Farrar's clenched jaw vocals can take a little getting used to. Eventually they blend nicely with the crisp play of his bandmates. A personal favorite is the cover of Ron Wood's Mystifies Me which is rendered respectfully."
5,"Transcendant. From the first listening , Even more now",Before being able to fully explain the beauty of a lyric your attention turns to the beauty of a harmony and melody remains like a familar scents that accompanies one of those memories you love. Or somethingGreat album. i was lucky to find it after hearing something in 'Drown' that has now become a after-thought on this beautiful completely transcendant album.it's a good
1,Not great,I don't think this album is worth the money honestly. I think you would have to be a die-hard fan to like this album. Sorry but I wouldn't buy another Son Volt CD.
2,Thank God for Wilco,"What am I, the only reviewer who didn't like this album? Honestly, I liked Uncle Tupelo and Wilco but this disc is just one long bore. With the exception of ""Windfall"" and it's dont-worry-be-happy chorus ""Let the wind take your troubles away"" (If it were only THAT easy, Mr. Farrar) these songs are bland, twangy ruminations on life, love and freedom out on the open road. I tried really hard to find a melody somewhere on this album, but gave up after about four listens. Buy this CD used if you have to hear it. Heck, you might even wind up with my copy. I got burned by paying full price but you don't have to."
2,Droning and depressing,"You'll enjoy this album if you're depressed and you want to stay that way. It's not melodic, the vocal style of Jay Farrar is a droning monotone - I guess some would consider it folksy, but I believe he could do better. None of the songs stick in my memory after 5-6 listenings. I'll probably sell it or give it away. The type of music I like: Dwight Yoakam, BR-549, Steve Earle, Lyle Lovett...hope this helps!"
1,Disappointing,"I love Wilco, Old 97's, and Whiskeytown. When a friend found out that I hadn't listend to Son Volt's TRACE he couldn't believe it, saying that it was the best in the alt country genre. I went out and bought it right away and all I can say is it was a huge disappointment.Jay Farrar's voice drones away, moaning some of the most derivitive lyrics I've ever heard. There has to be someone else in the group that has a better voice. The band is competent although uninspired. You've heard all these chord before, all the words, all the ""feeling.""I know almost everyone else loves this cd, but try one of the aforementioned groups above before settling on this bland assortment. Hip does not necessarily equal good."
5,So good . . .,"This is music so good that you can smell it. It smells like fresh air, hay, the taste of a cold beer on a hot day, a pretty sunset. It smells like the wind, crackly static, and the first fish you ever caught. Then later, it picks up, and it starts to smell like the first bar you ever went into, and the first cigarette you ever smoked. It smells like girl in front of you's perfume as you stood there, waiting for the show to start and wondering how you'd talk to her- hoping that maybe she'd back up and bump into you - or like standing outside on a rainy day.And when you're done listening to it for the first time - or even the hundredth time, it smells like heaven."
5,Music to live your life by.,"This album can only grow on you. Lyrics provide turns of thought and insight. The music is catchy, uplifting and tightly held together. A masterpiece."
1,"Not so good as ""pure pashimina""","Even though it said 3 ply, it is not as thick as my 2 ply Nordstrom pashimina.It is also feel rigid and rough.I returned it."
4,Well done.,"This book is a very good overview of WWII spies. Included are great propaganda posters in color, photos of spies, activities, and equipment, and great narratives of Axis and Allies spies and operations."
3,Reeds are a bit whacky,"This is a decent harp and its nice to have a minor harp for some songs, but I expected a little better playability for the price. My Hohner's play a lot better and the bends are more reliable and predictable. Maybe these guys buy cheap harps and then put a known name on them? I don't know, but the bang for the buck is not so hot."
5,Ms. Dynamite is more!,"Her debut single was an amazing one when it came out! When I first heard it, I thought it was an average cuz I wasn't takin' such a good listen to it. But man, it's one of the tightest songs I've heard in quite a while from a female singer/rapper! Personally, she is better than Missy Elliott to me cuz she gives more of a message than what Missy does. I mean this single is hot! I like the lines in her songs ""The things that you promote, fightin' violence, like you don't want to grow"" and of course the last lines of the chorus ""cuz while you braggin' 'bout your badness your just, avoidin' addin' to the reel s**t that's happening to us"" It's a hot tune! The B-side ""Dy-Na-Mi-Tee"" is a also a nice reggae garage track. Ms. Dynamite is da BOMB baby!"
1,Waste of money!,"If you're considering purchasing this book from Amazon, you obviously have internet access, and believe me, the information in this book can be found online WITH MUCH GREATER DETAIL than what you'll find in this book!All it is, is a bunch of computer generated images of TYPICAL hydraulic setups. I stress the word ""typical,"" because it taught me nothing new. This coming from a white boy that was a Hydraulic newbie at the time!Don't get me started on the choice of font used throughout the book and the GIGANTIC size of it! Its a joke...as if it was written by, and for, children!Spend some time on layitlowdotcom and you'll learn EVERYTHING you need to know, FOR FREE! Layitlow is an awesome and helpful community of peers, most of which are very experienced.Seriously, I was disappointed with this book. I regret this purchase."
3,I bought this book as gift for my daughters boyfriend...,"I grew up around cars. My father owned his own shop. I worked there as a teen in the summer. I probably learned more about cars years ago then alot of guys my age knew. However, I have veered away from the mechanics of cars and leave that up to my daughters boyfriend which is why I bought this book. he seemed very happy with it. So I guess it is a good book if you are into this sort of thing. :)"
4,Well done,"I'm a big Agatha Christie fan, so these stories were a hit with me. It's a wonderful bonus that they are read by the actors from the BBC drama series.The only drawback was that unbeknownst to me, my husband finds a British accent so soothing it makes him sleepy--which is an issue as we buy audiobooks for road trips. ;)"
4,"Good Stories, Excellent Cast","This is an audio recording of 18 short stories by Agatha Christie. The cast and narrator are excellent, the voices are distinguishable. The audio quality is good. With several stories in the collection, finding a particular story among the 7 CDs is a bit more of a challenge than I'd like to see. There is no index in the packaging or on the CDs. The CDs are packaged in cardboard folders in a cardboard box. So the indexing problem and the packaging are the reasons I dropped one star...otherwise these make a very nice collection."
2,POIROT'S EARLY CASES,I was very disapointed in these mysteries. Stories would begin on one disc and end on the next. That was very poor planning on someone's part. I would not have ordered them if I had realized how poorly they were put together.
3,Ooh No,"The DVD is ok, seems to get dull and boring after a few minutes. I watched the original series but watching it now seems dumb!"
2,"Classic hilarity, abominable DVD","The ""Mr. Bill"" short films are as bizarrely endearing as ever, but the DVD is a disaster. (Note that all the earlier reviews are for the VHS tape.)Here's the rub: ***ALL*** scanning and skipping functions are disabled throughout the entire disc! Want to go to the next film? Don't press the skip button; it won't work. You have to go back to the tedious menu and arrow your way slowly to the episode you want. Want to back up or fast forward a little in the film you're watching? Sorry, but there's no way AT ALL to do that.This disc is a cruel joke and should be withdrawn. It cannot be recommended at all as issued, though I found it impossible to give poor Mr. Bill only one star...."
4,"""Definitive Collection"" Is a MUCH Better Value","All the material on this disk plus more is contained in the three-disk Definitive Collection which at the time of this writing is in print, available on Amazon, and very inexpensive (especially through 3rd-party sellers). What the D.C. lacks is any printed material that might be included with this Anchor Bay release.Mr. Bill, BTW, seemed a lot funnier to me during his SNL run (this seems to be the general consensus), but even with hindsight, I'd probably still purchase the D.C., if only for an inexpensive trip down Memory Lane. Rating reflects the material, which I have seen, and not this particular release, which I haven't."
1,Did not work,"I was told this would work on the Harley Davidson Self inflating mat, by the seller of the mat. I followed the instructions to a T, but it did not work."
5,"Mirabal, Mirabal, Mirabal...","I first saw Robert Mirabal in Spirit Dance by Peter Buffet and Robert Mirabal was a guest musician and watching his performance was what grabbed me...he is great, talented and wow, can he wear those leggings...fantastic talent...I now own most of his CDS, just have to buy one more...keep up the wonderful work Robert...you are a genuine gift..."
3,Common Mistakes Good Parents Make,Slow hard to get into this book. We are using it as a class book study and having difficulty translating it to the group care of children. May be good reference for the parent.
3,Sturdy stand; color not as advertised,"This is a nice music stand, sturdier than my old one. But I was disappointed at its color -- lavender instead of the rich purple on my computer screen. It's a bit hard to unfold because it's stiff, but that will improve with use. The carry bag is handy, with its shoulder strap, but it's not the same as the picture online. It looks to me as if the one I received is from a different company. I wouldn't return it because of the color, but I'm sure to be a bit more wary of Amazon.com in future. If the color had been right, I would have judged it 5 stars."
2,It works but could be designed better.,"The construction of this little stand is rather weak. It was obviously designed by someone with little engineering experience. While it is lightweight and folds up into a small package, it is weak and tends to lean and sometimes fall over. I had to custom rebuild the inner joints between the telescoping pieces so that it was sturdy enough for my daughter to use."
3,Rising above standards,"3 1/2Classy introduction (though actually a sophomore release) this album began to clue listeners into the modern pianistic force Mehldau would become despite the disc's gentle, ballad-bearing tone."
4,All New People,"The book was very similar to Lamotts Travelin Mercies....only fictionalzed. It was sad and sweet and in some parts you were left kind of hanging...not sure what was meant or felt. Then again, Anne Lamott does that to you. She challenges you to branch out in your way of thinking. It was a good read."
2,Not a Novel at All,"I found this book by one of my favorite authors enjoyable up to a point.Reading her non-fiction, it becomes clear that this is a highly autobiographical evocation of her home town. And she evokes all over the place, often beautifully. But as a novel, it doesn't hang together. It's essentially plotless, often confusing, as she tells the stories of 2 generations from multiple points of view. Anne was not skilled enough at this point of her career to pull it off.A must for Lamott lovers, but hard to recommend for a general audience."
3,Not her best...,"While Anne Lamott remains one of my very favorite authors, All New People isn't really that great. The characters are unmemorable and the story line fuzzy. With the exception of the hilarious enormous nostril, this book isn't nearly as funny as Hard Laughter or Operating Instructions. If you haven't read any Anne Lamott, try one of those, or Bird by Bird to really appreciate her talents."
3,good account of the way things were,Many memoires of the ways things were (in the 60's). Not a favorite novel for sure but a good source of 60's lifestyles for some.
4,always love lamott!,she writes in such detail i can walk with her everyday. i can see her characters. i can feel her pain
5,Much better than expected....,"Before ordering this antenna, I read all the reviews, and wondered what I would be getting myself into. What a wonderful surprise, It really works as described! As an individual who lives for political talk radio, receiving acceptable AM signals is just one of life's challenges. The antenna wasn't purchased for my home in the Metro Detroit area, but my second home 261 miles to the north. Additional issues hindering reception are numerous trees, a river cut, and a cottage sided with alluminum. Even with the ""bounce effect"" of evening broadcasts, AM reception was sketchy at best. Short of putting up a roof-top array with a rotator, this has been a welcome addition. Mounted in a bedroom window, clear of the aluminum siding, I am able to ""dial in"" many of my favorite programs across several time zones. I am most pleased with my purchase."
3,C. Crane AM antenna,"With this extra antenna I' m tryinng for ~ 2oo miles. Since this action is @ nite, the reception is only fair since I'm not using any extra outside wire. I'd say I'm getting only fair value because it requires rather constant adjusting."
1,It did nothing,"Best guess is the antenna needs to be outdoors. At this point the unit does nothing at all, accept the red light comes on when I turn it on. Thats about it. I did hope it would help. I gave it one star because the rating system would not accept ""no stars"". Mkb"
4,works,Has to be tuned in to every station. So first you adjust the radio dial then you adjust the antenna dial. but it does improve reception.
2,Not worth the money,"I have been looking for a good am antenna for some time & finally bit the bullet for the CC TCF AM Antenna. I bought an ""orphan"" from CCrane. This is my second disappointing purchase from them. I could not get it to work very well & I tried it on a number of AM radios (GE, Hammarlund, Sony HD) & in a number of locations. It just never worked nearly as well as a simple long wire extended outside. I expected the preselection would isolate & amplify the signal, but most of the time it would just take a weak station just make it louder without removing the noise. A louder but still unlistenable station wasn't what I was after. Perhaps if you are in a location where a long wire isn't permitted, then this my be very expensive alternative. It cost me $20 (all shipping) to learn this lesson."
2,Didn't work for me,We have a kitchen radio where several AM stations contain a lot of static. This despite us being in a good location (on a hill with the radio towers visible). I tried the Turk hoop-style passive antenna (no connector on the radio) and that did nothing. So next I tried the Crane. I got some results with the Crane but the improvement was minimal. I suspect there's some sort of interference or that some of our aluminum siding (on part of the house) is causing the problem. If I had run the Crane antenna to my attic or outside I suspect I could have improved reception but that was going to be a lot of work for the return I might get. So I returned this item since it didn't work for me. The return process with Amazon was painless.
1,Dissapointed,I installed and followed the instructions exactly for this product and it did not improve the performance of AM stations at all. I was surprised based on the advertisement but it was a waste of $ and I have returned it.
2,Shell Shocked,"I wish I could have seen the inside of this book before purchasing it. The description made it look like what I was needing for an upcoming beach themed party but, it didn't deliver any fresh ideas. The pictures are black and white or drawings. Copyright is from 1977 and updated in 1993 so it was before so many simple materials and techniques were available. It is informative from the aspect of names of materials and types of shells. Newer books have much better illustrations and instructions for the novice arts and crafts person. For the published time period it was perfect but not for todays decor."
2,dated,"The projects in this book are dated, from the 60s and 70s, such as shells made to look like flowers or in a line glued onto the top of a box."
5,Across the Plains in 1850,"This author, Rev John Steele wrote the Sequel that is availabe in the Lakeside Classics. together you have the classic tale of three boys who are too young to vote before their return who have the classical experience of adventure.The accounts are extremely important to all historians and especally those interested in the Nevada City California Gold fields of the 1850s.But let the two books tell the tale and hope that the first book becomes a Lakeide Classic or at least get reprinted for wider disimnation. orgianlly only 2-300 copies printed so says my dealer.Robert McCord not only saves John's life but even today his name on Indpendence rock dated 4 July 1850 sits a top by the Flag Pole and considered by my wife; typical McCord -Biggest name on the rock said Sharlene McCord."
5,The best!,"This is the most accurate deck that I have ever read from. It is almost always accurate even about things people don't want to believe. This was my first deck and every one I have used since has given less detail. The cards are slightly larger than some of the more recent decks and I really like that. It really sets the tone, as if my hands recognize that these are different. The artwork is really unusual, they look painted, with gold backs. These cards still look beautiful after years of use. Still my favorite after trying many different decks!"
3,Good service good deck,"I am used to reading the Rider Waite Deck so this deck is a challenge for me. I don't connect with the pictures yet and some cards don't have words of what they are. The pictures are nice, but I like other decks more. Maybe I'll like the deck more once I keep working with it."
5,Portable yet well made,"Love this stand. The best thing about this music stand is it collapses easily and doesn't have to be taken apart to put in the little bag that comes with it. Just remove it from the bag, loosen the screws, expand and tighten the screws - it's ready to use in seconds. Also, the legs are much better than the last stand I replaced - the supports are in just the right place to make it very stable."
2,Not the same color,"The pashmina I received was not the same color as the one in the picture. It's too much trouble for me to send it back, but be aware."
3,Mesmerizing,"Did you ever wonder what the music of the Beatles would sound like if all the lyrics were replaced with ones from Christmas songs? Well listen to this and wonder no longer!The end result is surprisingly cohesive and pleasant to listen too. I really love 'O Little Town of Bethlehem' done to the tune of 'In My Life,' and pairing 'Let it Snow' with 'Let it Be' is very clever. Another one that's spot on is 'What Child is This' paired with 'Michelle;' the verses that were sung in French originally are also French here, a nice attention to detail.So if you want something a little different to listen to during the holidays and are a big Beatles fan, this might suit you."
5,Eloise Goes To School.,This story finds Eloise in the thick of things again at the Plaza Hotel and she finally offends her teacher and enrolls in a private school.Quite charming and my 6 year old enjoyed every minute of Eloise finding out her tutor was not so bad after all.If your child loves Eloise she or he will be delighted with this DVD.
4,Eloise is always entertaining.,"Didn't realize this one was animated, but it was a good one anyway. My 3yr old really enjoyed it!"
1,"Trash, won't charge properly nor hold its charge for long","These things are trash, they don't even send you what's pictured. They'll send you two chargers, and the batteries themselves can't hold a charge on my wireless keyboard for more than 8 hours (other batteries last weeks).When I first got them, I started to charge them, there was no indication given of when they were fully charged, even after more than 40 hours being on the charger. So I took them out, and used them, and I tried charging again, still no indication of being fully charged. Now I'm using a different Nimh charger, they definitely charge fast on the other nimh charger, but they also don't last long.Don't buy if you want it to be replacing and recharging several times a day."
1,THIS IS NOT a charger for Fuji Cameras,The product listing certainly implies that this is a charger for Fuji cameras (FUJI Finepix S6000fd S6000 S9100 S1 PRO S2 S20 S3 S3000 S304 S3100 S5000 S5100 S5200 FUJI DS-7 DX-10 DX-5 DX5 DX-7 DX-8 DX-9 MX-1200 MX-1400 MX-1500 MX-500 xia Ix10 xia iX100 FUJI FINEPIX E900 S9000 S9500 S5100 S3 S5000 S1 S2 S20 PRO S3000 S304 S5500 S602Z S70)In reality it simply charges AA batteries
4,Good but..,"This does not feel like a real documentary. We had trouble getting engrossed, yet have only watched about 20%. We have not given up hope."
4,A challenging and thought-provoking essay on health care,"I was surprised to be the first to offer a user review of this book; it was really fascinating. Rothman provides a short, ""page-turner"", essay-style book looking at landmark decision points in the development of modern U.S. healthcare, from the invention of the iron lung and renal dialysis (rationing problems), to the political battles between socioeconomic classes, AMA, and unions in the development of Medicare and Blue Cross. As I write this, Amazon features a long review from the New England Journal of Medicine which is favorable about this readable and challenging book, but notes the reader may debate Rothman's conclusions as well as agree with them. It's a great overview of modern US healthcare which may leave the reader with more memorable ""take home lessons"" than the 500-page histories of healthcare and society. Rothman's approach may shape the way you think about other aspects of American culture and history as well !"
1,No enema kit with it.,"Misleading description. This is just a water bottle with a plug. There is no enema attachments. They don't say there is any attachments but they infer it, to me this is dishonest. This may be an honest mistake, but I doubt it."
4,Flag,"The flag was As big as I expected it to be and it fits on a window great but there are loose strings hanging off the ends of it, otherwise great product"
5,Great product!,"I thought a receiving blanket would work just fine, but when I got this cover that was made for the changer I was so surprised at what a huge diffeence it made! I love this cover and it fits like a glove. Highly recommend this cover for your infant change pad."
5,So soft,This cover fits perfectly and it is incredibly soft. I purchased the cover in ecru and the color is lighter than in the picture. It is more of a cream color.
5,"Nice fit, very soft","I havent 'used' this yet, as my baby isnt here yet, but I did wash it and put it on the changing pad. It fits great and is very soft. I have other covers that I used with my son and this is by far the softest."
2,sage color is awful!,Product as described but the sage color is really fluro green. It is very ugly!
3,Bright,"This cover is almost neon green. It's REALLY bright... so consider this before you buy it, considering if you like or do not like bright colors."
2,"Very soft, but didn't fit my change pad","When I saw this, I was very excited. However, since my pad is raised on four sides, rather than two, it did not fit properly and I have to return it. What a bummer! I can't find a change pad cover that will fit my pad, so I guess I will have to go without."
2,"Works fine, but not at all needed","The pad cover works okay, but it was not very practical and it was therefore a waste of money for us. If your little one ever leaks or spills (as ours did a couple of times a day), you'll end up taking this off and washing it every time that happens. Instead, if you simply skip the cover, you can just wipe down the underlying (plastic) pad in a few seconds. Save your money (and laundry loads) and just use the pad itself!"
1,ultra soft pad cover,"polyester material , bad for baby, better to use cotton. I returned the same day it arrived"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"This is a perfect fit for all changing dressers, soft under baby's body, is well made, cleans up easy and last."
4,Soft and warm,This is a very comfortable changing pad cover. Our baby enjoys it much more than lying on the cold changing pad. We were disappointed that the different colors were different prices.
2,Don't buy it!,"I bought this as an extra changing cover after I realized I needed a couple more. I originally purchased the ""circo"" brand from Target I think, and assumed this one would be just as nice- mistake- the fabric is thin and cheap, feels like a bad polyester material- the other brand is much much better...."
5,very soft,"Lovely color, coordinated very well with the wall color and other decor. Fabric very soft, fit and covered pad completely."
3,Color is NOT Sage,"The changing pad cover is very soft and fits appropriately. The only problem is that it is NOT sage in color; it is more of a lime green. I had read this in another review and chose to purchase it anyway, but was disappointed when the product arrived and sure enough, it is lime green. If you are looking for a bright green changing pad this is a great one, if you want a sage changing cover keep looking."
2,elastic broke,"While this is super soft, the elastic broke all the way around the bottom after one wash. my daughter's new favorite hobby whenever this cover is on is to pull it off and chew on it."
4,Fits Simmons Contoured Changing Pad!,"I just bought this changing pad cover for my baby who is expected this summer, and one of the things I was a little concerned about was if it would fit my existing changing pad that my son used. We have the Simmons Contoured Changing Pad, which seems to be a popular pad for people to use, and I was happy to find that it fits very nicely. The fabric does seem a little thin, but I will not know how well it will hold up, however, until the baby comes. Pottery Barn Kids also sells really soft chamois covers in a variety of colors for $19 a piece, and I have one of those for my new baby, too. The Pottery Barn one is a bit thicker. Once I test them both out I'll be sure to update this post and let you know what I think!"
5,So Soft!!!,I love these pad covers! The fabric is so soft and feels great to the touch. We just found that putting a small muti-use absorbant pad under the diaper area saves a lot of time and hassle. We keep plently on hand and just replace one when it gets soiled. That way the plush cover stays fresher longer and you dont have to remove and clean it so much. Washes and tumble dries easily.
1,Dimensions not as stated,"The Product Description says the cover is 34"" x 17"". It is in fact 32"" x 16"" as stated on the packaging."
2,Not light blue,"I give this product 2 starts because the cover is wonderfully soft. However, I'm returning it because it's not the soft light blue as pictured. It's a darker, cornflower blue with the tiniest purple tinge to it. I might buy again in white just to be sure I know what it will look like. Great product other than being a different color than pictured!"
3,"Wow, sage is a horrible description","Looking at the pictures, I thought people were overreacting to the color - but no. Neon green is indeed a much closer description than sage. If my sage herbs looked like this, I would have asked what nuclear plant they grew next to. Just Wow."
4,quantity > quality,"It is soft and comfy, fits well on the contoured pad and washes well. We would like it to be priced a little lower, or to come in a cheaper pack of two. We have a pack of the Nojo changing covers, which come in a 2-pack for similar price. The Nojo works equally well and there's a back up when the first one gets peed on, which happens several times a week."
5,"Soft, plushy and cute",Loved these so much I bought 3...because you WILL need more than 1! Very soft and plushy...son is so happy being changed on these..he loves the feel of them. Wash up very well and are quite durable. We change and wash all our pads quite a bit with a 3 month old!
4,Great so far,"This fits perfectly over the Summer changing pad, it's soft and very nice. Hasn't been used yet, so I can't speak to how it holds up. The sage is a very nice shade of green."
4,Not bad....,"Very soft, nice baby blue color. However description states that it's for a contoured changing pad but when I put it on there's some room between the middle of the pad and the cover. It's not tight, when baby gets placed on it, it conforms but when baby's not on it it's lifted."
4,"It's nice, but useless","My son occasionally likes to pee when we change his diaper, so having a plush changing pad is pretty stupid. It's super soft and can make the nursery look cuter, but it's useless. We just place our son on the actual changing pad, so that we can wipe up his messes when necessary."
3,Good quality...does not fit all couplers,This coupler set is very good quality and seems to be a very strong lock set. But the barbell type coupler does not fit on my travel trailer coupler. I like the fact that it came with 4 like keys as other sets i have looked at only had 2 keys. I almost kept it just for the receiver lock just for the fact it had 4 keys but decided to return it because the reason of buying a kit is to be keyed alike. If you decide to purchase this set just be sure the hole in the coupler on your trailer is well above the ball plate. This was the problem I had with the barbell type lock would not close as it was hitting the sides of the ball plate.
1,Not worth your time.,"My mom borrowed this from our church and I had to watch it when I was about 11, even then I knew a lot more about the history of Halloween than the makers of the series seem to. It showed some footage from Wiccan Rituals and interviews with witches, which is kind of surprising since it's obviously supposed to be about the dangers of Witchcraft and Halloween.The ironic thing is that this tape made my sisters and me becomes Wiccan in a roundabout way by making us want to research it."
5,Amazing,This book is absolutely amazing it's thought provoking & if you already making a shift in your life it will help you with a gentle nudge.It a must have!!!
5,life changing,"This book talks to the need in all of us to be understood, forgiven, hopeful,accepted and encouraged to reach the serenity and God connection we so sorely desire. There are prayers for every life situation and with true honesty it aides us in facing, owning and accepting the solutions through God that are available to us. Thank you Amazon, Thank you Marianne Williamson"
5,A true gem,"Marrianne Williamson's work is both real and honest. Rather than couch things in a concepts that are alien or extremely religious, she talks to you about the realities of existing. Of how things will not always be easy, about how you will lose your way, and honestly how to see people clearly. Growth is messy, it's not neat, maturity is not easy, nor is spirtiuality delicate work, but with assistance from a tape like this you can see yourself clearly and how to bridge yourself from concept to human to spiritual being."
4,great prayer book,"I have really enjoyed this book, even though I find myself reading it a little out of order. I feel that the prayers in this book will help those who want to build a bridge between what is in the heart and how to speak it to the Lord. I find a prayer from this book both morning and night. This book has a prayer for just about anything you might be going through or someone you may know."
5,Illuminata,"This was money well spent the Best book I have ever read,Thank You so much Marianne Williamsom.The book is sooo very helpful"
4,A book of prayers . . .,"This wonderful book by Marianne Williamson, is full of prayers for every occasion you can think of. Besides these wonderful prayers, there's some uplifting, intelligent, and spiritual thoughts added by Ms. Williamson that add to the theme of the book.If you're soul searching, if you're looking for that spiritual path, and if you enjoy the voice of Marianne Williamson, this is a book for you."
1,Beware final pages before giving as a gift,"I enjoyed the prayers in this book very much. I have enjoyed A Return to Love, A Woman's Worth, Healing the Soul of America and Everyday Grace.I almost had this book wrapped and ready to give to friend when I read the last four or five pages. I was shocked at the type of language used in this section. It was very disappointing that what could have been a wonderful gift was ruined by this thoughtless addition."
5,Great Rangefinder,"The rangefinder is very easy to use and provides very accurate measurements. I like it much better than handheld GPSs because you always know the distance to pin, not just to the center of the green. It is really helpful if you want to layup to certain areas, you can find a measurement to anything, not just to the flag. It's a little expensive, but well worth the money."
5,A great tool,"I find the Rangefinder easy to use and extremely accurate. The real advantage of having a rangefinder is inside of 100 yards, when knowing that I'm 57 yards, not 50 yards, from the pin can save a stroke. (Knowing that I'm 157 and not 150 out rarely matters in my score, although even in that case I like to be confident in the distance.) Calculating distances using sprinkler heads just isn't as accurate when the pin is not in the center of the green (i.e., on 2/3 of all holes)."
5,bushnell golf pinseeker,"I bought this item for my husband for his birthday.I consulted his golfing buddies and they all agreed that this was the best rangefinder. I had been to Dicks and sports authority and found the best deal on Amazon.He really likes it,at least he uses it every time he plays golf(every day!!!)"
5,Excellent Rangefinder!,"I've used this product for a few weeks and it works great! It can easily pick up a flagstick at over 300 yds. As mentioned in some of the other reviews, the less expensive range finders have difficulty in acquiring the flag (unless the wind is blowing). I tried one last year and took it back because it was basically useless. The 1500 performs exactly as advertised."
5,hotshot,"great product, reliable accuracy, best price i could find from any seller and they delivered when promised"
4,Performed as expected from reviews,"The 1500 Laser Rangefinder has performed just as I read in other reviews. I think the positives outweigh the negatives. I'm a 58 year old female and haven't had an issue with having a fairly steady hand to locate the pin. Objects behind the pin are picked up as well, however there is a method using the laser to eliminate those objects and just focus on the pin. Knowing the yardage to the pin has been very helpful. One still has to take all other factors into consideration as well...slope, speed of greens, wind, etc. Of course, you have to hit the ball correctly, too!"
4,Dark Occult Fiction,"This Stephen Mark Rainey novel is certainly not lacking in atmosphere. Rainey expertly creates a sort of claustrophobic, helpless feel in this here tale of a man who is revisiting his hometown only to find his brother's house ransacked and unoccupied. Strange messages, written in blood appear on the walls, certain people in the town seem a bit...weird. That is about all you should know before going into this.The only thing that I found a bit annoying was the dialougue from one of the characters who, to me, overexplained things and sounded a bit too much like an encyclopedia. That minor distraction did not ruin the read, but kept it from being in the realm of excellence, instead making it mearly a ""very good"" read.I reccomend this book to anyone who is into dark, occult horror fiction. The writing is smooth for the most part and the main characters come off as believeable. The atmosphere and suspense will not let you down, either.Just my 2 cents..."
4,The LEBO Coven,"Stephen Mark Rainey is the real deal. The darkness in his work is rivaled only by its heart and soul, which makes the Lovecraftian vibes all the more interesting and refreshing. Rainey has a voice all his own and it pulls you in. It takes hold. It speaks to the spirit. It has power. The characters live, breathe, feel. His soul has a voice in his fiction, which is unmistakable and agreeable. The narrative angles are human and often tragic--as horror of the best vintage is.Though The LEBO Coven is not without its conventions, the writing tackles them from a fresh angle and does it with admirable energy. The occult mechanics of the story engine are heavy at times, but do not bog down the momentum. The action is well-done, and the twists and jarring surprises will keep you turning the pages to the end."
2,Better To Spend Your Money On A Box Or...,"While the remastering is warm and never sounded better, a person exploring Yes for the first time would be better served by picking up either the new expanded Close To The Edge,The Yes Album or Fragile and moving on from there...either of these ""early"" releases showcases Yes exploraty mode of music.The In a Word box set is lavish and pretty good at what it does and the earlier Yes box,YesYears, is also very good.Naturally,the newer sounding box and re releases sounds better than Joe Gastwirt's earlier remastering but both are good.As the other reviewers seem to agree there is not much as to quality and length of disc 3...the artwork is nice but skimpy packaging and one needs to ask for whom was this collection released?"
4,Yes to Yes after 35 years,"Yes was the first rock and roll group that I ever liked, aside from the Beatles of course. Many years ago in college I felt energized by the great Yes songs from The Yes Album: Starship Trooper, Yours is No Disgrace, and I've Seen All Good People. This 3 CD collection has those, of course, as well as Roundabout, their big hit that followed The Yes Album. I had forgotten that they had also produced the hit songs Owner of a Lonely Heart and Leave It, delightful surprises after so many years. There are 31 tracks total on the 3 CDs and I'm not convinced that all 31 tracks are as interesting as the ones I've mentioned but, nevermind, listening to many of these songs will transport the original Yes fans back to the '70s and many could be hits with today's young people."
4,More old and less new!!!,"When I got this collection, right away I enjoyed the first disc with tracks like Roundabout, Heart of the Sunrise, And You and I, and Time and a Word. On the second disc only up to Tempus Fugit I like, (but I don't care much for their newer stuff anyway). The third disc is okay, but there is no songs from their first album or Tales from Topographic Oceans. It is good, but not ultimate."
1,"This band has the most ""greatest hits"" cd's in history",This is getting crazy...How about some new stuff?
3,Nostroso Cabeeliabante Ebita Sunoco,"Well, Yes is a psychedelic band; very talented. Personally, I think everything from the 80's that they did sucked and every album they did in the 70's sucked after Bill Bruford left. Therefore, I would say disc one is good if you like sectorological music that induces tunnel vision. ""And You and I,"" ""Roundabout,"" and ""Starship Trooper"" are great tunes, I just wish this band didn't start sucking after 1972. Oh well...POOP SPLATTERS"
4,Yes - 'The Ultimate Yes' (Elektra/WEA) 3-CD Box Set,"Sound quality is great and all,but my only comment is this 3-CD box set could've easily been scaled down to a 2-CD release.I mean,who has time to listen to three lengthy CD's anyway?The '70's staples are here,like ""Time And A Word"",""Yours Is No Disgrace"",""Roundabout"",""Going For The One"" and so on.Plus the vital '80's material is present such as ""Owner Of A Lonely Heart"",""Rhythm Of Love"" and ""It Can Happen"".I guess what I'm trying to say is that 'The Ultimate Yes' is strictly for someone looking to replace maybe a bunch of old lost Yes CD's,records,tapes,etc."
3,Merely a Sampler,"Completely mistitled, 'Ultimate Yes' is no more than a sampler, and not the best of compilation that it could've been. I only give 3 stars because it's Yes, after all.First off, many tracks worth of a 'best of' mention are not here, namely the longer tracks, such as 'Close to the Edge', 'Gates of Delirium', and no mention at all of anything from 'Tales from Topographic Oceans'. Secondly, the edited tracks are butchered, removing key parts of the music.Lastly, and this was just with my purchase, the last disc was unplayable.I cannot recommend this as a good place to start, because you will come away with an inaccurate representation of Yes. Only purchase this if you are filling out your collection of Yes cds."
1,Disappointed,In my opinion a band that cannot create new music and release the new material without surviving on past glory should retire. It makes you think that maybe its the record label as usually the record label makes all of the money on a album/CD
3,Half a Masterpiece,"Disc one: Rivals any of the top 15 all time greatest hits discs in history.Disc two: With the exception of the first 5 songs this disc, can be trashed.Disc three: With the exception of a couple of ""classic"" acoustic versions, this disc can be trashed as well.Is there any Yes fan, who is not bipolar, like both the classic and contempoary versions of Yes? You got to keep them seperated, as the song goes.It is a travesty to see an easy top ten (disc 1 - 5 songs on disc two and a couple of acoustics on three) all time, greatest hits album defiled in such a way.I bought it to compose what should have been and trashed it all.I give my compilation 5.5 stars!"
3,Only acoustic music pay the CD,All Yes coletanias is the same. The same song and everything. If you have all as me do not by this. This CD has the value only for the acoustic songs. This is realy very good ones.
3,The same but better...,"Box sets are the recording industries, ""Best ofs"" for the die hard fans, while this isnt a true box set it has just enough unreleased stuff to qualify as one. all the staples are here to make any classic rock radio fan happy, plus a few of the more upbeat ( top 40ish ) songs from later works. If you dont have all the yes albums, but really like roundabout when you hear it on ---WKLH-classic rock 96.5--- then pop the 20 buck and you will be happy as a clam. remastering does seem to make a real differance as they do sound great.Oh, and by the way, to all the people who say that Yes newer albums arnt that great havnt listened to them enough. Since they dont play anything past 90210 ( 1980 ) on the radio you just havnt gotten familar with them yet. Magnification ( on dvdaudio ) is insane! completely awesome."
1,Don't purchase this item.,"After waiting 5 MONTHS to receive this video, it was greatly disappointing. Boring documentary that offers little insight into either soccer or Brazil, and NO instructional value to an aspiring player. My son loves soccer, is fascinated by Brazil, and watched this video ONCE before declaring it a dissapointment. Buy another video!"
1,Over the bar!,"I ordered this item months ago and today I just got an email saying:""Though we had expected to be able to send this item to you, we've since found that it is not available from any of our sources at this time. We realize this is disappointing news to hear, and we apologize for the inconvenience we have caused you.""""We must also apologize for the length of time it has taken us to reach this conclusion. Until recently, we had still hoped to obtain this item for you.""Funny thing is it still says it will ship in 1 to 3 weeks and it is sold and shipped from Amazon.I am sure the DVD is great - This is no knock on ""GOL!""Amazon gets the Red Card on this one!"
1,Dangerously uninformed,"... The book seems to contain a lot of rumour and hype, recast to look like facts and serious substance. The most immediate giveaway that the author needs to learn something about the topics he writes about is his complete failure to recognize that Java (tee em, the programming language) is a totally different thing from JavaScript (also tee em :) He has a section title introducing security issues with Java Scripts, but the discussion refers simply to ""Java"" some of the technical descriptions clearly relate to Java, the programming language, but most of the ""threats"" he identifies are nothing of the sort...."
1,The book is a high gloss advertisement for security consulti,"After reading this book, I felt that the book was another high gloss advertisement for the author's security consulting firm. Even the glossary is not even close to some of the common definitions that are used in the firewall/internet and security industry. The mention of firewalls throughout the book is cursory at best and does not mention vendors that produce commercial firewalls. The Companion CD is at most mostly demos and could have been better documented. Most of the information in the book could have been acquired off the internet a lot more easily than it is mentioned in the book. I hope in the second edition or the errata to the book, that it is hea vily revised to accomendate the present status of the computer security/internet and firewall industry."
5,Great blend of old and new,This is a great mix of traditional music with an upbeat modern mix of instruments. It is a very cheerful CD and is very easy to listen to repeatedly.
4,ABBA in Japan-About Time!,"This is the long overdue presentation of ABBA's tour in Japan and concert on Japanese television.We have previously seen poor quality video clips and fuzzy lifts on Youtube of the TV show,but this DVD is professionally produced by Polar Music with excellent photography and sound.The 1978 show included all the group's big hits at the time(e.g.,Dancing Queen,Take a Chance on Me,SOS,Eagle,Fernando,Waterloo,Money/Money/Money,The Name of the Game,Knowing Me/Knowing You,and Thank You for the Music;also presented are my personal favorites-That's Me,Summer Night City,Tiger,and If It Wasn't for the Nights).The Japanese sponsors of the show added a lot of supporting dancers,decoration,stage effects,and back-up musicians which evidently reflected what they considered proper and necessary for a rock group--it's a hoot!The documentary portions of their travels in Japan are interesting and well-done too. This is a must for true ABBA fans!"
5,Great alternative to Pop Tarts!,"I am constantly looking for healthier alternatives for my family. The ""healthier"" part isn't very hard, but pleasing picky kids is. My kids love these--they actually said they taste better than the Kellogg's Pop Tarts they have eaten all their lives. I've tried them and I agree--the crust is much more flavorful and I feel much better having these in the house than the other ones. Try these and you'll never go back!"
2,Didn't like it.,The art work is brilliant but unfortunately each track sounds very similar. The producers really need to bring more variety to the choice of music and the instruments used.
4,Something *slightly* different.,"I like this style of music when I paint, but I've needed something different for a while now. This fit the bill. It's not a favorite or anything, but it works well as background for art. You can only listen to Enigma for so long."
1,It is bad,I bought this mouse for my thinkpad T61 notebook. It does not work properly at the begining and it totally fail to connect to my notbook in one month later. There is another bad point for this mouse. It is much heavier than other wireless mouse. I switch to Logitech v220. It works perfectly and very easy to use.I don't recommend to buy this mouse. It is really bad.
1,Spyware Included!!,"Mouse works great. The problem is that when you load the included disc in Vista, you are asked if you want ""set point update.exe"" to acess your computer every time you go online. If you remove the logitech files the mouse no longer works. This is just more built in spyware that Logitech uses. Why does my mouse need constant updates? I am now looking for another brand of bluetooth mouse. This one is going in the trash!"
3,Craps out after a few...,"Installation is easy, and the software searches for updates immmediately.But... for no apparent reason it stops working after a while! Sometimes no more than 4 or 5 minutes of use, sometimes as long as an hour. Then it just stops. The software says it's connected, but it's unresponsive. It's necessary to reboot, or sometimes you can tell the software to 'reconfigure' it an it'll start again.I don't know if this is the computer's fault, or the mouse's.. but that part is unsatisfactory. Logitech's help site gives no information for this problem. There is unrelated information for a different mouse with similar complaints, but the 'fix' is irrelevant to the V270.I dunno if I'd purchase another one or not."
2,not supported for MACs!!,"Well I read all the glowing reviews and thought this would be a great mouse for the Mac. But.... there is NO software for the Mac to program the buttons!I called Logitech and sure enough, no support for this mouse.has anyone found a way around that?"
4,Comfortable and reliable bluetooth mouse,I bought this mouse because I was tired of using an RF or IR wireless mouse that continually went to sleep on me. This mouse set up virtually instantly on my laptop. No numbers or codes to enter. I have built-in bluetooth and it immediately recognized my new device. The mouse action was smooth and there was little or no latency on laptop wake up. I love the power switch on the bottom to help maintain the battery life. This mouse is small enough for a computer case but big enough to be used comfortably (I have fairly large hands). I am quite pleased with this product and would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a bluetooth mouse.
2,Problem,"This mouse caused my MacBook 2.16 to not awaken from sleep.Also, to be honest, no wireless mouse I have found tracks as well and smoothly as the Apple wireless mighty mouse.I am returning it and would not recommend it with MacBook, unless there is something unusual in my particular case"
1,loses BT signals,"Would NOT buy again. Just a paper weight now. Kept having to reinstall drivers,for it to work a while. Not installed once but 50 times in 20 days. Logitech CS was no help either.Bought a Targus 2 months ago and There Bluetooth works. Will sell this one cheap,even the case was cheap too."
4,Excellent mouse but...,"I am running a laptop w/Windows XP sp2. It came Bluetooth ready. I never could install the software that came with the mouse. Honestly I don't know what differance that makes because it works fine without it. Perhaps I don't have some of the available functionality, or maby I am saved from unnecessary software.For me the primary shortcoming is the lack of third button. I use a third button for an escape key. I sorely miss this feature.Otherwise it is a very smooth, comfortable mouse and it seems to have good battery life. It uses regular batteries which I prefer to rechargable. They last a lot longer and I get tired of messing with the cables and extra hardware. I always have extra AA batteries around so this works good for me."
2,Connection goes boom all the time,"So far, this mouse did not show its purpose. I bought it to be used with a brand new notebook with Bluetooth enabled. It connects immediately, but the connection between the devices is dropped all the time and believe, it's trully anoying. My BT driver is up to date, and I have no connection issues with my BT phone, for example, even using its audio gateway.I will give 2 stars, because it's still not working properly. I will try to figure out if this is a common issue or if it's something specific with any of my devices. I'd like to give it a 5, really."
2,Replace your frustration with a cord for another,"Just barely acceptable for the price. The optical resolution is worse than Logitech's cheaper USB corded mouse. This means if you switch back and forth, you have to constantly change your mouse tracking speed in the control panel, or your corded mouse will move at half speed.The body of the mouse is smaller and lower, which makes it hard to relax your hand while using it. Lastly, you must install Logitech's SetPoint software to use the mouse effectively. If you've ever owned a logitech keyboard, webcam, or even remote control, you'll know this implies multiple processes running on your machine (per user) using unnecessarily large amounts of memory."
1,Does not work well with Zoom 4312,"The mouse immediately paired up with my Zoom 4312 Bluetooth PC Card, but if turned off or after it goes to sleep it is almost impossible to get talking/working again. Repairing is the only thing that seems to work.I updated to the latest Zoom drivers (Toshiba BT stack) and also tried the built-in Microsoft XP bluetooth stack and BlueSoleil stack. All have the same problem.If you search the Logitech knowledgebase you will see a lot of people having these issues and the responses from Logitech support have been no help."
4,Bluetooth wireless mouse,"Easy to install, easy to use. I like the fact that it will sleep. Most wireless mice kill the batteries in no time, this one seems preserve the batteries very well. It can also be turned off for when you are traveling. Previous wireless mice that I've owned would just let the battery die as it tried to read whatever surface was in my bag."
1,Sick mouse,I have had the mouse for about a month. It has never made it through a hour session on my laptop without dying. You can be bringing the cursor across a page and the cursor will freeze in mid page. The mouse will also start to wander around the screen on its own. About a third of the time you can restart the mouse with the Logitech software. I've replaced the batteries twice and have downloaded the latest software. I have found the Logitech software non-intuitive and not specific to the device.It's back to the Microsoft mouse for me.
4,Great mouse for Mac running on Leopard,"I have been using the mouse for over 3 months now, and have never had a problem. I'm still running on the same batteries (alkaline ones)Installation was not a problem and took no more than five minutesThe only small drawback I can think of is the fact that before logging in to one of my accounts I need to use the mousepad on my mac, since the mouse takes a little while to work"
3,Average bluetooth mouse,"An average product with unimaginative design and ergonomics. The Radtech product line of bluetooth mice look better, are more ergonomic, some recharge from the USB port, and are color matched for the current line of Apple products. For a desktop computer, the Microsoft Optical Mouse fits best in my hand; it is wireless but not bluetooth."
5,Excellent Bluetooth Mouse !!!!,"All I can say is that this little mouse is one of the best I've had the opportunity to use. I find it quite comfortable to use, not too big and not too small. The precision of the pointer is excellent and it has turned out to be a wonderful addition for use with my ThinkPad laptop. The battery life has been exceptional as well. All in all, you can't go wrong with this little beauty. Dollar for Dollar, truly an exceptional buy."
3,Not Good for People with Small Hands,Mouse works fine. Not comfortable for small handed users. Tracking feels a little forced at times.
4,Nice Mouse,"I bought this unit for my laptop and instantly loved the feel of it. It synced up to the Bluetooth on my Dell with no muss and no fuss. I attempted to install the software and it told me my bluetooth stack was incompatible. I upgraded the stack from Dell's website, and it sync'ed again, but still said the bluetooth stack wasn't supported for the software.The feel of the mouse is great, and once you go wireless you may never go back. I give Logitech credit in that the mouse performs great even without using their software. I would definitely buy this again."
4,Great product,"The mouse works without a glitch. I had to use the Blue-tooth drivers that came with my Toshiba. The Logitech drivers had problems installing on my new Toshiba laptop, never could get it to work (reason for the 4 stars).The batteries last for ever!"
1,lousy connection with OS X,"I bought this a while ago to use with my MacBook Pro and thought I would try it once more before throwing it in the trash. Now I've thrown it in the trash. It loses Bluetooth connection with the Mac about once every three minutes for five or ten seconds each time--plenty long enough to lose your train of thought.This disabling problem is *on top of* the software limitations. OS X 10.4 offers very little customization of the mouse: no double-click, no control-click, etc. A responsible manufacturer gets around this by offering their own driver and preference panel. That's what Logitech does with ""wireless"" USB-plugin mice, but the Bluetooth mouse comes with *no software at all.* Their customer service does not respond to repeated queries.Unusable."
3,Short Fall,"I bought the v270 to use with a Dell inspiron with internal bluetooth and Vista home premium. It took several tries to get the computer to find it. Since it found it the first time that has not been a problem, however, sometimes the scroll wheel works and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes I can turn the radio off and back on and it will work and sometimes it won't."
4,"Excellent mouse, but beware the driver!","I've allways liked logitech mice, and when I bought a Bluetooth enabled ThinkPad laptop I rushed to buy the V270.The ergonomics is absolutely great, al least for my hand size, I think it might feel too small if you have a large hand.After a few days of usage it froze completely, the signal level didn't show anything so I thought it had broken.Went to Logitech's donwload area and got the last version of the SetPoint software and installed it... but nothing happened, it still didn't work.I was about to give up, but went on to read the support forums.The result: YOU HAVE TO UNINSTALL THE SHIPPED VERSION OF SETPOINT (2.44b), REBOOT, INSTALL THE LATEST VERSION (3.30) AND REBOOT AGAIN.I'm (again) the happy owner of a great mouse."
4,Great wireless mouse for the $$,"While using a PowerBook G4, this mouse works great. The battery life is fantastic. I haven't had to change the batteries yet. It's been well over two months of heavy use now. Set-up was a breeze. The only issue I have with it is that the tracking is a little too fast for my taste. I tried to slow it down by one more increment, and that turns out to be way too slow. End result: I had to get used to a slightly faster tracking than I am used to. Otherwise, this product works perfectly. Great value for the money!"
4,Does its job well,"I have the Logitech Cordless V270 bluetooth mouse. It does its job pretty well. I like the fact that it is a fairly compact mouse, but isn't too small. The wheel works well, and it connects via bluetooth pretty quickly.I've downgraded it to 4 stars for 2 reasons. The first is that the Logitech setpoint software isn't exactly compatible with the Synaptics touchpad drivers that come with my Dell e1405 notebook computer. Everytime the computer restarted, the synaptics mouse acceleration setting would go back to the default setting. Eventually I figured out that uninstalling setpoint allowed the synaptics driver to work better. The cost of removing setpoint is loosing the acceleration of the mouse.The second issue is that the mouse isn't exactly smooth in its movement on the screen. I suspect this has to do with it being a bluetooth mouse, as I've never noticed this behavior on my wired, or regular cordless mice."
3,Much lighter and less erratic for now.,"Initially, I had 3 issues with this mouse:1) Too heavy;2) Erratic, jumpy;3) Lost connection too often.The mouse still worked with only one battery. So removing one of the batteries resolved issue #1. To resolve issue #2, I uninstalled the Logitech Setpoint software and let Windows handle the device. So far so good. I will update this review and report the status of issue #3 after using this mouse for a while. Due to the compatibility issues of the Logitech software and the annoying sleep feature, I'm giving this mouse a rating of 3 stars.... I'm back after 2 months of usage. I kept loosing the connection. I finally gave up and bought a Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 4000."
4,Nice little travel mouse,"No problem to install, simple to use. It's worked every time. Nice little travel case. I use it at home and on travel. Only thing is I wish it had the auto-zoom button feature like the USB/bluetooth Microsoft mouse, but for a fraction of the price, this one was a great deal."
1,No OS X Support,"Logitech offers no support for OS X. If you think you'll be able to program this mouse for even simple stuff, think again. Also really noisy ! I gave mine away to a windows user. A bit misleading in advertising it's Mac compatibility."
1,can't make this thing work,New Dell Latitude D620 running Vista. Tryed to install after downloading Vista drivers from Dell. Install failed. Second time installed but didn't work. Uninstalled/Reinstalled with help from IT - Still no go. Sent it back. I'll wait for one that works with Vista.
1,Did Not Work,"I tried to install this mouse on a three year old Sony Vaio factory equiped with Bluetooth and it simply did not work. It could not be found by the software. After attempting unsuccessfully to get customer support, I returned the product for a refund."
1,Do not buy this product,"This product is terrible and I'm going to return mine or throw it away. It constantly wanders to places I don't want it to be or trails where I think it should be based on my usage of other mice. At this point I consider it unusable. I've tried it on several surfaces to see if it was a tracking problem, but noticed no real change in behavior. I think what's happening is it keeps trying to go to sleep while I'm moving it, because the tracking is OK as long as I'm moving it very quickly, but when I'm trying to precision target something like an icon or a piece of text it starts jumping erratically. I keep it about 6 inches from my laptop at all times, and the laptop isn't complaining about connection problems."
1,obsolescence designed in,"After a year or two the pairing code on the bottom of the mouse has rubbed off, making it impossible to pair to my machine and therefore more or less useless. This is obsolescence designed in, environmentally abhorrent, and not good value for money. Avoid."
5,Wireless,These are used by almost everyone in my office...they must be great or I'm sure the boss wouldn't allow the purchase!
4,I Like It,"I like my mouse. It doesn't always work for some reason, but the problem might just be with my computer. This was a good purchase."
1,Logitech V270 Cordless Optical Bluetooth Mouse,I found the software drivers to be incompatible with my Sony Vaio laptop and returned the product for a refund.
4,Great mouse for the money!,"This mouse was a breeze to pair with my HP DV-6000 laptop. Battery life so far seems to be better than the normal wireless mice that I have used, especially given the 2-3 hours a day use that it gets. The convenient on/off switch on the bottom helps save juice even more. Tracking is excellent, no jumpiness, and the feel is quite nice. It's almost the same size as a normal mouse (just a hair smaller than the desktop versions of Microsoft's offerings), and the design and construction was definately geared towards mobility. It comes with a sleek neoprene zippered bag/sleeve, so as to not scratch up the signature Logitech matte finish. Oh, and amazingly enough, it pairs with some smart/pda phones (Cingular 2125 and the 8525 are the only ones I've used)."
4,Works well with Toshiba Tecra M5 - no sleeper here,"I was concerned about some of the reviews that mention the mouse falling asleep and taking a while to wake up. I guess people have really different expectations than mine -- I have no objections to my mouse doing this to save battery life. The wake up is actually instantenous, as soon as you move the mouse or click it, it's working. My laptop takes longer to wake up from the screensaver. Quite happy with the performance and the battery life. This product works for me. I would only advise you to look elsewehere if you're looking for a teeny-tiny laptop mouse instead."
5,Awesome pointer for notebook,"good quality, nice design, sets up and works flawlessly (did not have same problem with sleep as prior poster, it does sleep but comes out of sleep mode transparently as soon as you move it).i have used this product under FreeBSD 5, FreeBSD 6, and occasionally WinXP, on a ThinkPad T43 and now a ThinkPad T60p.i like the bluetooth over the normal USB dongle wireless for two reasons:1) no dongle to lose or break off2) no interference from other devices if you have more than one wireless mouse or keyboard in the same area.great product. don't know why i don't see it more often in retail stores, you have to go online to get it."
5,Does everything it is supposed to...,"Bought this to use with a ThinkPad T40 and a DBT-120 USB adapter. Pairing was no problem, and the mouse works very well. Battery life with rechargeable AA cells is OK, lasting about a week. This mouse works with my PowerBook G4 as well. I'd recommend this mouse to anyone wanting a Bluetooth solution."
5,Highly recommended.,Another quality Logitech product. Much better and less expensive than the Apple wireless mice. The scroll wheel and right mouse button are crucial.
1,Mouse is Nice but Logitech does not Honor Warranty,"Mouse worked great for the first two months, but then died. I tried to have it repaired under warranty. Logitech promised to ship a replacement, but 2 weeks later, no replacement. Their customer service is horrible and you will not hear back for a week. If you try calling you will be on hold for hours. Very disappointing and my last Logitech product."
5,Great little gadget,"I bought this about a month ago and I've loved it since. It's great not to have to connect little USB devices just so you can this wireless mouse. My laptop (Dell Inspiron 640m) has a built-in bluetooth module so this little mouse is all I have to carry with me. No wires, no hassle, finally! The precision of this device is also very good. I am not a professional graphics designer or gamer but so far this mouse has been great for everyday use."
2,You couldn't pay me to listen to this...,"I'm usually a fan of Utada, and I thought this album would sound like ""Exodus."" I was, however, very wrong. On ""Precious,"" she has one of the weirdest voices I've ever heard. Sometimes she sounds just like a man! Another thing is that the background music totally overshadows the vocals, and it gets irritating straining to listen to what she's singing. Her English isn't very good either, which is also annoying throughout the songs. There's a reason this CD didn't do well. Pick up ""Exodus"" and don't waste your $40 on this one."
5,Especially Meaningful for the Holiday Season,"I finished Aggie's beautiful story on Thanksgiving night in a lonely truckstop parking lot. The issues her story raises are as relevant to modern humanity as the ancient. The characters she develops are as realistic and believable as the family next door; their living arrangements are educational and interesting. Several symbols and motifs are prominent throughout: the Holy Grail, the sandy terrain, the shadowy Moses (while a character, can be argued symbolic of law and structure), and the garments worn. All of these interesting scenes, metaphors, and symbols are in keeping with our own Christian traditions at year's end. While this book is appropriate at anytime, it is especially pleasant during the Christmas holiday season. And if you have a little lonely time on your hands, her exciting and cheerful plot will engage your mind and bring you closer to God's love."
5,"Interesting look into ""Bloody Tangipahoa""","Hyde does a fascinating job of outlining the social history of the piney woods region north of Lake Pontchatrain and east of the Mississippi. From a brief overview of the colonial days of the region to its short-lived Republic of West Florida to its eventual incorporation into the state of Louisiana, the Civil War and through Reconstruction, Hyde explores the social and economic tensions between the wealthy planters nearer to the river and their neighbors to the east.These economic tensions (and the resulting political manipulations) helped create a culture of violence in the region that lasted well past Reconstruction. As the final chapter of the book outlines, Hyde's own family was involved in a long-running feud that claimed several lives. The personal details interwoven into the history (and the many photos he was able to include) add to the depth of the work."
5,A Good Piece of Southern History.,"This is an excellent book for those interested in a factual, no nonsense representation of the Florida Parishes in the Old South thorough the early twentieth century. I believe this book offers the serious student of southern history a significant glimpse into the lives and doings of some of the people who were affected most by the War of Northern Aggression. I highly recommend reading it to broaden your understanding of Southern History."
2,A very one sided view .,"I really liked the first 3/4 of the book. Very interesting and informative. When it came to the feud between Sam Hyde and the Goss', I believe you were a bit one sided. I am a descendent of the ""Gill"" boys. My great-grandfather was Alonzo Gill. I am not proud of what my family did in those days, but it was a sign of the time. As far as I am concerned, it takes two to tango, and I don't believe Mr. Hyde was such an innocent victim as you tried to show.Petrina Gill Avants"
3,typical hilarious Jilly Cooper,"Unambashedly trashy fun! Don't know if you have to love horses to love her books, but I can't get enough of them, totally trashy as they are. It helps to have a wacky sense of humor. I only give it 3 stars because this is not great literature and not as good as Riders, her best novel, but I have to admit I've read and re-read it, and it's entertaining every time!"
5,A Ton of Fun After Getting Past the Learning Curve,"The Wii's innovative remote and nunchunk has a lot of potential and I'm glad that the makers of Dragonball Z Budokai Tenkaichi saw the potential and ran with it. There is a slight learning curve using the remote but once you get it down you will find that you can have a lot of fun, be very creative, and even get a slight workout.I've never seen the show but that did not stop the ability to learn and enjoy the game. Granted, I still have no interest in tooning in, but don't let the lack of familiarity with the show stop you from picking this up.If you like the Martial Arts type of games (like Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Combat, et al) then you really need to try this out with the new feature of the Wii remote and nunchunk."
5,DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 2,"This is the 3rd dbz game I've bought, and the best one yet. The character roster in this game alone makes it worth it to buy. The 1 player mode lets you play through vertually every battle in DBZ,movies, and GT. the other modes are pretty great too. Once I beat the game the ""Free Battle"" is what kept me playing the most tho. coming up with different teams and what-if battles is tons of fun. The wii motions controls make it simpler to do things, but not too simple. There's so many things you can do in battles that it's nearly impossible to keep track of how to do everything, but they have every combination and control in a sort of cheat sheet option you can get to by pressing start so that's never a problem.The bottom line is this is a very rich and well thought out game that offers so much fan service that any DBZ fan would be a fool not to buy it. I'm completely satisfied."
5,The go to reference point!,"Reference books by nature are used to help you understand the subject they are written about. They are not exciting nor are they intended to be. All reference books have their usefulness and this book is certainly the go to book on the subject of religion and philosophyOver 3,000 entries from Aaron to Zwingli and everything in between is what you will find in this one of a kind book. The author appears to be a subject matter expert and this is probably the most extensive listing I have ever encountered.This 675 plus page book covers more religion and philosophical topics than any other out there today. You may need other resources for a more detailed description, which the author has included in the bibliographies.Most impressed by the author's ability to cover more that the traditional religions. Overall this book makes the perfect on-hand reference - excellent job!"
5,"From the first notes I heard, I knew Kate was the REAL D-E-A-L!!! A HUUUGE Talent","""Kate Schutt's masterful NO LOVE LOST is meticulously composed and beautifully performed.""-- ALL ABOUT JAZZ, Eyal Hareuveni""With songs that flow seamlessly from track-to-track, Kate displays the poise and execution of a seasoned performer on a major label. From the provocative string arrangements on the projects' opening song, ""How Much In Love,"" to the most commercial track, ""Raining,"" this CD is a treat for both new and old school lovers of Jazz (who will especially appreciate the stellar ""Wrecking Ball""). Other gems that fortify this project, ""Two Halves,"" ""The Moon Got Broken,"" and ""I'm Yours"" make this a CD that can - and should - be listened to in its entirety for a more fulfilling and complete experience. Not to be overlooked is the spunky, Jazzy rendition of Sheila E's ""Glamorous Life,"" which was bold, ambitious, and successful.""-- THE MUSE'S MUSE, Gian Fiero"
3,OK for the price,"I paired these with a 10"" Athena sub to replace some very old Boston Acoustics A150 three ways I bought back in the 80's. Well, I got what I paid for. These are functional speakers, but there is no clarity. When I originally bought my A150's 20 years ago, I compared the Boston Acoustic 2 way (A100) to the 3 way and noticed a vocal clarity difference in the 150's. Well, I just lost it. These little speakers have crisp tweeters, but the pseudo-woofer just can't reproduce midrange elements (vocal, piano, etc). I'll keep these speakers since they are pretty cheap and can be used elsewhere. Now I need to find some similar sized speakers that will bring back the vocal clarity I just lost. Guess I need to get a crowbar and pry open my wallet. Or, honestly, go to a local store and do a listen test. That's the only way to do an honest comparison. I wonder if I can find a little pair of 3 ways..."
4,Great cheap little speakers,"These are great little speakers. They have a small footprint and have a great balanced sound. They work great as stand alone speakers. I'm not sure I would pick them for a surround sound environment, but if you need stand-alone speakers with a small footprint, these are great."
3,Not a very efficient speaker for it's size,"Got a pair of these just to hook-up to the television. Didn't work as well as I planned. Am now considering using them for the rear channels on a surround system. I was comparing them to my high-end stereo speakers. Although it really isn't fair to judge a pair of $50.00 speakers against a pair of $1000.00 speakers. I found these little speakers weren't very efficient. I found the specs rated at 87db. I would have thought the small drivers to be more efficient than that. So they require you to turn up the volume a little to hear them. I also find them a bit ""muffled"". Still I give them a rating of 3 only because of the price. You typically get what you pay for and for $50.00 you get a pair of mediocre bookshelf speakers. I think they'll pass for rear channel surround speakers if your not too demanding. I might add that they are constructed pretty well (solid) for the price range."
3,Good for the price but it doesnt hurt to spend a little more,First of all I have 2 stereos one at my house in Zeeland Michigan and one in my parents house in Spring Lake.That means I have 2 sets of speakers I have the 200Hs in my house because I like them more and they were more expensive at least when I bought them 3 or 4 years ago.The 150Hs sound pretty nice for as cheap as they were but there are a few differences in sound.The 200s have clearer treble and smoother bass and sound better when played at a moderately high volume.The 150s are decent but Im already thinking of upgrading to the newer 350s that are recently on sale now.If I like them enough I will keep them at my new house and keep the 200s at my parents' and sell the 150s back to Amazon.But still these are pretty decent.
2,Not For Home Theater,"This is not a 2 way speaker, but a fullrange speaker with a supertweeter. There is nothing wrong with this type of speaker, in fact, I much prefer it to a 2 way which is crossed over in the critical midrange area. This however requires the main driver to go to at least 15,000 Hz. Unfortunatly,Sony put in a woofer which probably only goes to 5,000 Hz hence the hole in the midrange.This speaker is fine for background music, but doesn't cut it for home theater. The midrange is so muddy I miss alot of the dialog.I plan on salvaging the nice enclosures by installing a Fostex FE87E. Sure I'll get MUCH less bass, but I can always add a subwoofer."
5,Great Speakers,These are great speakers for small bookshelf speakers in the back of the room or up on the kitchen cabinets. They have good range and base for small speakers. I'll be buying some like these except outdoor speakers for the deck.
5,Best speakers I ever had,"I got these speakers because I've never had any good speakers in my room. So for $50 these things are awesome! I was amazed at the quality of sound you get with these. They sound fine by themselves, but paired up with the sony subwoofer (sa wm250 vary awesome too!) they sound great."
4,"Not his best, but worth owning","This isn't Nick Heyward's best record. It's not his second or even his third best. So not counting the Haircuit One Hundred LP/CD -- which, c'mon, really is just a Nick Heyward vehicle -- I'd rate this one ""fourth.""But Nick Heyward is a very gifted songwriter, with a knack for crafting delicate, beautiful melodies perfectly suited for his voice. And there's only so much in the way of recorded Nick Heyward out there. So after you've bought ""North of a Miracle"" -- Japanese import with the nine bonus tracks version please -- after you've added the Beatlesque ""The Apple Bed"" -- and the ""Kite""-powered pure pop of ""From Monday to Sunday"" -- it's time to add ""Postcards from Home,"" if only for the upbeat ""Good-bye Yesterday."""
2,Pretentious and underachieving,"I must admit that I have not read any of de Sade's works, so my review may be colored by that fact. However, I felt that the narrator's voice was tiresome and uninteresting. His take on being an appreciator of beauty wore thin on me. Even with a mild deformity, he was uninteresting. I figured out the story line ahead of time and felt nothing about any of the characters. I wasn't expecting an erotic novel, but I was hoping to get what the book jacket advertised, ""the wit of Wilde, the sublimity of Poe."" It didn't even come close. Save your money or look elsewhere for something more engaging. Sorry."
4,Very Interesting,"Justine, by Alice Thompson, is a very interesting read. I especially liked the way reality and fantasy are interwined and can hardly be separated. It was a very nice book, though I'm sure my reading it in a Hebrew translation has flawed it's charm. But even in translation, the writing is very flowing and it was simply impossible to put the book down (though I did have a test to study to, at the time). All and all, a very recomended book for th lovers of good fiction."
3,Real Life & Love,This is story of real life and love. Michael is a playboy who changes girlfriends every other month. Sally is Michael's ex-girl and his best friend who still loves him. Katie is young Sally look-a-like and Michael new flavor of the month. Jude is the only realist in the group who finds herself in the middle of her friend's chaos. The friendship and love are so real who feel every emotion the characters go through. I would not say this was favorite read but very thought provoking.
4,Chick lit with a razor edge,"Lauren Henderson, known for the Samantha Jones mystery series, has been branching out into chick lit with a distinct edge. In ""Don't Even Think About It,"" Katie moves in with her new boyfriend Michael. Michael's ex-girlfriend Sally and her best friend Jude live across the street and all three are very close, much to Katie's displeasure. Complicating matters are: the torch Sally has carried for Michael for nine years after their relationship ended, Michael's womanizing, Katie's accidental pregnancy, and the appearance of Sofie, a temperamental, egotistical French artist who was Michael's first love (and shattered his heart).My only complaint is when the book spirals to a startling denoument it stops with the immediate fallout, then rushes to an epilogue and leaves out a few scenes I would have liked to see, but can't reveal without being a spoiler. Still, it's a nice read on a lazy afternoon."
5,Valuable Insight,"MS Scarf writes a captivating, engaging, book using real life (they feel quite real) couples to illustrate many of the relationship dynamics she explains.The center piece of Intimate Partners is the examination and application of the notion of projective identification. This notion is common in the psychological discussions under different names. MS Scarf introduces the notion clearly. Other notions she uses are family of origin implications and genograms.The book heavily relies on acceptance of general psychological theories.This is not an easy read. It is worthwhile, valuable, contimplative and, most of all, useful in the context of daily life. If you are looking for spoonfed, formula solutions go somewhere else."
1,Psychoanalytic mumbo-jumbo,"I found this book to be flawed in its very nature. Scarf attempts to explain the problems of the couples in her book using categories and classifications of psychoanalytic theory that are utterly unfounded. She attributes the problems of mairrage to self-imposed psychoanalytic conventions that do not have a true basis in real life. Her explanations of things such as ""projective identification"" are almost comical to the reader with a critical eye. For example, she attributes the jealosy of one partner to the other partners, unexpressed, repressed feelings. This analysis seems to try to stretch a simply jealosy issue of one partner onto the other. The takes a simple problem and makes it complicated with carefully selected detail and over-zealous classification."
1,Jamin Keys,"This is a computer program that I thought was a piano teaching program. If that is what you are looking for, save your money. It was basicaly a waste of time and money."
1,product has not arrived yet,have not recived product from seller purchased on the 2 of march please contact thanks m johnson
4,A good starting place,"This is a very good place to start if you're new to yoga. Denise covers the basics and takes her time with the stretches. Sun salutation is a good way to end the exercise. The only drawback I found is her patronizing way to say you're doing ""wonderful"" and everything is ""beautiful"". How can she see me? I don't look that great!"
1,Read before you buy,"Misrepresentation of product, you see a picture of a stylus pen but this product is not a writing stylus pen. Also beware, I purchased this thinking I was getting 3 stylus but only got one."
3,sinner,"I put this item a 3 star due to the fact that my stylus's were not pen's as described when i was ordering but i did receive 3 as stated, over all im happy with them."
1,Not a pen,"The title of this product is misleading. This is a stylus and not a stylus pen. I ordered these because my last remaining stylus pen was leaking ink when I unscrewed the cap. Although the title says ""pen"", you cannot use this product to write on paper. The Palm website says it comes with a ""Stylus"", so it's reasonable to believe a ""stylus pen"" has ink and you can write with it."
5,A must have book for your library,"I purchased this book for my philosophy class--Philosophy and Old Age--and have not been disappointed. The art work is extraordinary and allows one to not only read about the historical views of aging but to also see old age depicted throughout history in the art work from the Greek and Roman worlds to the 20th century. I have to say this is one textbook I was assigned to buy that I have not regretted paying the price (and it was much less than a textbook, I might add!). It would be perfect on the coffee table and should be somewhere that others can pick it up and browse through it. No matter what age one is, this book will grab the reader from the beginning, will make one think about his or her own life, will enlighten with its well-researched info, and will stay with the reader long after the reading ends."
5,Excellent research on global piracy,This book is an excellent review on the Golden Age of Piracy in the 1700's. The author has many firsthand accounts of pirates and their victims and also describes why piracy developed into such a lucrative business. A very enjoyable read for anyone interested in maritime studies.
4,"I sing love songs mostly after dark, mostly in saloons.","This big 20 disc collection contains every studio recording that Frank Sinatra made for Reprise Records. That's over 450 songs. A lot of these recordings are great, but with that many songs, there are bound to be a few not-so-great ones (and there are). But the good outnumbers the bad by a wide margin. If you are a Sinatra fan with money to spare, you should get this."
4,A great collection,"This is truly the ultimate Frank Sinatra set. It includes some of his great covers, including his classic renditions of ""Winchester Cathedral"" and ""Girl From Ipanema"". It's a must have for any Frank connoisseur."
3,Not this time...,"I've owned one of these mics for a while and was very happy with it. Needless to say, I was disappointing when I needed a second one and found out that they were discontinued. Fortunately, I found a used one on Amazon. Unfortunately, when I got it it was broken. So - overall I would rate the mic a ""5"" for performance, but the one I just bought was actually a ""0"", but you can't rate a zero on Amazon, hence a score of one. (how can a USB product stop working?)"
3,shows promise,The interface of this game is rather confusing and the tutorialis as always in these cases incomplete. For younger players thisdesign is probably not a great deal of fun.
4,Fun easy game.,"This was a fun game to play. It was almost as fun as Medieval Total War. I removed 1 star for the combat interface. Combat on land is fine, it was similar to the total war series. The naval combat is where I removed the 1 star. The naval combat can be confusing if you have more than 3 ships, you send off a ship in a particular direction, andyou forget why you sent the ship in that direction ion the first place. It would be nice to issue orders while paused.Not only that, the empires are not truly balanced. Playing campaign mode hardest level of difficulty, England is the easiest to play. If you can defend your coast with fleets, you will never be invaded. All the other countries, you need a sizable army to defend yourself or risk invasion in the beginning. Getting resources to build an army takes time."
2,Imperial,"Game keeps crashing. Tried to re-install and not any better. Very odd error messages. ""DLL file missing"", but checked and its present, sometimes ""can't execute error"". All the while i have the disc in the cd drive. Sometimes in the middle of play the game crashes and you are instructed to close it. Very sorry I purchased this game, from this company. Well, adding this to this review. Norton scan the files and found two bugs."
4,My review,"This game was a bit hard to understand the game play even after going through the tutorial. But the basic understanding of the game can be grasped pretty quickly. A basic understanding of the units abilities and tactics of the time period are a big plus with this game. It does take alot of time to build up any sort of military that can conquer any other country. I don't like the fact that you are limited on countries you can trade with and declare war against, but this is only at first. The user friendly of this game makes it a good choice for anyone that may have some experience in the real time strategy games such as Civilization, or Rome total war. Overall this is an enjoyable game and even more so with some knowledge of the time period in which it is set."
3,Not as good as i remember,Well the game itself is kinda boring only played it once i was expecting more from what i remember when i played it a while back
4,Copy Protection on disc/unable to play,"My Nephew has this game so when I found it finally on Amazon I bought it. Only 9.99 (plus shipping) not a bad deal. However once I received the game due to a ""copy protection"" on the disc my computer couldn't read/play it. Luckily it worked on my Nephew's PC so we traded discs! There should be some kind of warning that the disc can not be played on `writeable' drives before purchasing any games."
4,IMPERIAL GLORY IS A BLAST,If you like strategy games you'll love this one.The campaign map is somewhat dull but the battle maps are realisticA real plus is the realistic naval battles.
1,Might as well ink on tissue paper,"There's no end to how frustrating this boards are to work with. The pencils are just about like drawing on printer paper. It just feels a bit too smooth and the pencils smudge and wipe easily, almost to the point that you lose lines. But, that's not the real frustration here. Inking these boards is absolutely horrible. Have you ever drawn on tissue paper? Every time you apply the pen to the paper it absorbs the ink. With a bristol board type paper you can get nice smooth lines. Not so with these boards. My lines look absolutely terrible, jagged, ragged and spiky. I wouldn't recommend these boards even for practice. They're absolute garbage and they've ruined some otherwise decent art. Stay far away."
4,Great paper... Kind of,"This is exactly what it says, Industry standard comic paper, the only problem that i have with it is that unless you have REALLY tight pencils and don't need to erase anything too much that you WILL smear your inks cleaning up your pencils, this paper is also not good for steel nibs (they will tear into the soft paper) or large amounts of black that are put down via brush (it tends to warp no matter how stingy you are with the ink itself) if you get this paper I would also reconsider getting a good supply of micron brush pens or just some decent felt tip pens for inking. I have used this paper over and over again however and am consistently happy with it despite its flaws. If you are looking for professional grade paper and want your art to be at industry standard for commissions this is probably the best way to go for any price that is not ridiculous."
5,sugar and spice and everything nice.,"Frasier's character tones down and the comedy is far better. There are many great and classic episodes with Bulldog, Gil, Roz and Bibi; the supporting cast. Also an improvement on the direction of the radio show cast."
3,subtitle problem,"i really love this show, but for some reason the subtitle doesn't work well.the 1st season is fine. for the 2nd, there seems to be no subtitle at all.(maybe a few glimps of it at the 1st episode?) for the 3rd season, the subtitle is often scrambled and incomplete. it's a shame for such a show with great dialogues. is it so hard to make the subtitle right?"
4,Prepare for laughs,"This is one of my all time favorite tv shows. I have purchased seasons 1-3 as of right now and have not been disappointed. The characters have really come into their own in this season. Watch for one of my all time favorite episodes entitled ""Moon Dance"". It's an instant classic."
3,not that great,"The premises for the episodes aren't as good. We don't really need to see relationships overlapping between Roz and Niles and Frasier and Daphne. That's just the typical thing to do. That's why I hate Friends. But, there are some good episodes in there. Ray Liotta, one of the most underrated actors ever, is a guest voice. So, it's all good. I'd get season one if I wasn't completely broke."
1,Frasier - The Complete Third Season,"Not having Good English Subtitles (or Closed Captioning)is almost criminal. It's like having a park or building with no provisions for the handicapped--no ramps, not modified toilets, no close parking spaces--omissions that might lead to lawsuits for accessibility. I know several people who have refrained from buying the Frasier series (especially the seasons after season two) for the simple reason that there are no subtitles. Maybe when it comes out on Blu-Ray this will be remedied.Top Class ShowLow class product from people who don't consider all of their customers' needs. And I'm not being unreasonable--almost every DVD from other companies includes subtitles."
5,A TOUCHING STORY ABOUT THE NATURE OF TRUE MIRACLES,"The Inner Glow reminds us about the nature of true miracles: they are powerful, but personal experiences that come to us as ""still, small voices"" that speak peace to our hearts and bring about lasting change.Ehly's somber and realistic story about how a man deals with his son's terminal illness not only shows us how adversity is necessary for growth, but how it can renew our faith in God and help us to find truth and beauty amid the most tragic of circumstances.The Inner Glow is well-crafted, with a beautiful retelling of the biblical battle between David and Goliath and a tear-wrenching conclusion that will send you running for a box of tissues! It is the essence of the old verse that ""a child shall lead them."" I recommend this book to anyone who has experienced loss and everyone who has not... yet."
5,Reader,This book is a wonderful book. I would recommend it to everyone.It definitely touched my heart and will touch all who reads it.It was a great short read packed with inspiration and very moving. This author has written a remarkable story.
4,Very listenable collection of songs from Mark Knopfler,"If you love Dire Straits, you'll like this one. Mark Knopfler pays homage to his roots and then some with this very enjoyable collection of Irish, rock, bit of jazz, country and even Zydeco music. Rudiger is very atmospheric. The solo in the last song and the lyrics are just great."
4,Great Mark Knofler,Great CD with the track number one used in the movie Twister.I bought it because of this music.
4,Golden Tracks,"I can't agree with the reviewer who gave this recording two stars (He should know better than to stop taking his medication). I have owned a copy of this CD since it came out and I still listen to it on a regular basis. I happen to think it's a very strong solo effort. I was a fan of the early Dire Straights material, however; I think much of their commercialized later work started to all sound the same and became boring. So, if I hadn't heard Golden Heart at a friend's house, I may never have bought it. I'm glad I did! On this CD, Mark Knopfler showcases his versatility without straying from his distinctive style. If you're looking for a hard rocking party album, this ain't it. If you're a fan of Seattle-style head-banger R&R, this ain't for you. If you want a great listening CD with R&R influenced by a great mix of musical styles performed and recorded well, I highly recommend this CD. You can't go wrong."
5,Profound!,"I first listened his work in Japanese guitarman's concert. His name was Kanji Ohmura. Through him I came to know he instrumental music the theme of ""Local Hero""[soundtrack of Motion Picture, Yes, Movie itself was pretty nice one]. Actually I know nothing about Dire Straits, and I expected other ""Local Hero""s from this CD. I was wrong. It is different from it. But same in profoundly deep spot in the heart. His message from disc is, I believe, 'love your family, homeland, yourself.'Especially I like 'Rudigar' and 'Are We in trouble Now?' (What a lovely song!). Irisf fiddle and whistle and harp sound good, too. If you'd like to get old beautifully, you'll like it."
5,My family's favorite (9 yrs old daughtr&Dire Straits lovers),I have a maximum of 1000 words for my review but one would be enough: Great!
4,"Golden heart, golden guitar","I have just received this CD and gave it a few listens. An overall good opus from Mr Knopfler. In my book, he is one of the great guitarists in the world, no doubt about it. He has a unique style and great talent for melody (""Cannibals"", ""Golden Heart""). ""Brothers In Arms"" was a masterpiece. Shades of it appear on this CD. His melodies grow up on you with time and stay forever. The lyrics are not always strong, nor the voice. But he is true to himself. And this CD adds another chapter and a few great tunes to his already impressive catalog. Must I add that I love that steel guitar sound ! Keep up the good work, Mark. And pay your fans a treat: a Dire Straits all-studio box set with book and personal notes. Add some of your solo work also, if possible. My wish for the New Year ! Paul LeBoutillier"
3,Not quite 24 carat,"Like many others here, I'm a big Dire Straits / Mark Knopfler fan. On the heels of the last DS album, I had expectations of more great MK songs. Sadly, 'Golden Heart' didn't quite make the grade. 'Sailing To Philadelphia' and later releases were major improvements, fortunately.It is interesting to note the variety of favored songs mentioned in other reviews. For me, 3 songs have stood out quite clearly as favorites: Imelda, Vic And Ray, and Je Suis De'Sole'. The other 11 tracks all seemed...pleasant in some respect, but didn't rise to the occasion...that being a desire to replay them frequently.I had not listened to the entire album for a long time, so, upon reading other reviews, I figured I'd give it another try, which turned out to be a good thing. I had somehow overlooked Don't You Get It and Cannibals - good stuff. A couple of others also now seem a bit more than passable: Darling Pretty and I'm The Fool. So, a 3 star rating seems about right."
2,"Liven-up, already!","Excellent composing and instrumentals, but Mark's vocals lack all hints of energy or inspiration. Even when the tunes are lively, Knopfler's voice never rises above a mumbling drone. Very dissappointing for a work with all of it's other elements working quite well."
1,Disappointing,"I am a big fan since the Dire Straits days but It seemed like he was trying for a different sound, which is OK but I fiund it trite & slightly annoying."
5,Antietam,"I started reading this book at a B&B I stayed at during the 150th reenactment of the Battle of Antietam. I found it very intrested and on point concerning this unique aspect of the overall battle. The usual treatment of the ""Burnside Bridge"" battle centers around the bungling Federal leadership, this book looks at the battle from the Confederate side and has much comment on the private soldier. I recommand it for those with a deeper interest in the battle."
5,"Not your ordinary, predictable jazz... listen up!","Galt MacDermot is a celebrated composer and pianist - but perhaps his most often overlooked achievement is his artistic depth. Jazz across decades that is still fresh - listen to these tracks! So many jazz artists take a left turn, and produce music that is not ""accessible"" or easy to feel. Other artists water it down into elevator music. Not Mr. MacDermot. Drawing on his years spent in Africa, plus his classical training, Mr. MacDermot and his New Pulse Jazz Band continue to produce hit after hit after hit.Next Broadway show: Spotted Owl ... let's get a script!"
1,Does not hold up!,"My husband and I purchased two of these for our two labs to go backpacking. Fortunately, I carry an emergency sewing kit, by day two most of the straps had fallen off and the pack bottom came unsewed. The straps are also not designed well, they do not put the weight on the dogs shoulders, if you try to adjust the pack, it causes rubbing sores behind the dogs front legs. I wrote to Mountsmith to inquire about their product, and 1 week later, still no response. This was my last Mountsmith purchase."
4,Highly recommended for those who feel the need to please.,Great perspective on why we NEED to please. Offers real advice and solutions to overcome your guilt.
3,3 Parts Symptoms to 1 Part Solution,"Great title...well written...and nice design. This book is really geared toward those who have yet to discover they are struggling with approval addiction. It lays out very well all the symptoms, thoughts, and feelings one may have and experience when craving approval.If you already know you struggle with this problem, it can become frustrating sifting through all the symptoms to get to the solutions (which are too brief) of how to handle various situations. It might have helped in the design of the book to have designated ""Ta-Da!"" moments or very clear ""here's the solution"" boxes. Otherwise, you can miss them once you move into scanning mode.There is definitely helpful content, but the book overall is a ground-rule double rather than a homerun."
5,Effective Assessments and Action Plan,"Psychologist Harriet Braiker has broken this book into three sections: Part 1: People-Pleasing Mindsets; Part 2: People-Pleasing Habits; and Part 3: People-Pleasing Feelings. Parts 1 and 2 include assessments and stories that give you a clear picture of your own tendencies regarding people-pleasing. Braiker then provides a 21-day action plan for you to put into motion. This book is great if you're always saying ""Yes"" in negotiations or if your behavior sends the message that you're not ready for the next big leadership role."
5,Me'Shell is a true original,"This is Me'Shell's best recording, and in fact a quintissential new funk/R&B; recording that deserves a place in anyone's collection. It represents an exploration, both sonically and conceptually. The songs that start out as ballads end up as tight, intense grooves, and the songs that start out fast still sound smooth and deep.I was attracted to this recording because I am a bass player, and Me'Shell is as funky a bass player as they come. What brings me back to this recording, again and again, is the quality of the songwriting and the boldness of the musical statements she makes. Buy it."
1,Black RACIST,"Great music - real funk and soul to sound but the lyrics of one of an ANGRY RACIST. I'm glad she made an album called BITTER because its a perfect description of herself and many in the black community. Change the word White to Black and vice versa and make her a redneck and this album would never be produced. Original music, same ole ""feel sorry for me because I'm Black"""
5,tight and intellegent with killer riffs,"An excellent second album, Peace Without Passion begins where Plantation Lullabies left off. While the first was more relationship oriented, this album is about religious conflicts both in the world and with oneself. She continues to deal with issues of race and sexuality in ways that may put off some, but this album rewards repeat listenings. Musically she continues the strong style from the first album and displays the talent which makes her a well-known session player for a wide variety of artists. Thumping beats, soaring harmonies, and a smattering of all styles of music make this an outstanding disc and a perfect summertime groove."
3,"Not as good as Bitter or Plantation, but still a good CD...","I don't know what I was expecting, but for some reason this CD didn't strike me like her other two. It isn't that I don't like it, but I don't like it as well as Bitter or Plantation. If I had just heard the CD by itself, without knowledge of the other two, I'd probably be pretty impressed. However, it just seems to have a more neutral feel to it than the other two releases.Bitter was slow, soft and painful. Plantation was in your face angry. Peace was.... just there?Her lyrics are insightful and sharp with truth, like her other two CDs. There are a couple of excellent tracks, but the rest feel mediocre to me... and for such an ""unmediocre"" artist that was disappointing to me.If I had to pick only one of her CDs, it wouldn't be this one."
1,What a shame,"Beautiful voice, but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd. I was offended just reading every name on this cd...It is really a shame, what pretty ""vulgar"" voice. If this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears. You should be ashamed of yourself as an artist, as you have such power, but it is spent on prepetuating hate. Nina Simone was a angry artist also, but not once did she offend me (caucasian male) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america. The first song I ever heard of hers ""Mississippi Goddam"" made me cry, so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice. There will always be a ""racist america"" because people are selfish, but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist. I liked the cd until I heard the lyrics, one less sale adds up after awhile."
4,Hard to get to higher levels,I like it a very lot!!!! But the hard thing is getting to higher levels. Like the Elephant graveyard or Pizza Planet. There are no cheat codes for this game. But if you have a gameshark the codes rock!!!!!!!!
5,Seek This Book Out!,"This book is wonderful! Squire presents the myths and tales of the Gaels and Britons in an incrediblt engaging way. If you enjoyed d'Aulieres Greek Myths as a child, you will love Squire's equally entertaining (albeit more advanced) style. The book is seperarated into two main sections, Gaelic (scotland+ireland) and Briton (england+wales) and covers all aspects of their lore including, King Arthur, Gwydion, the Tuatha de Danaan, Bran, Fomors, Sidhe, and countless more. It also presents historical evidence and comparisons in a completely un-boring way, woven right into the fabric of the stories. An EXCELLENT book!"
3,Could go deeper,"If you have read other Marcia Tate books on brain friendly teaching then this book really offers little that is new. It is basically ""Worksheets Don't Grow Dendrites"" for grown ups. The techniques and strategies suggested are applicable to children as well as adults and Marcia does not really delve into the uniqueness of the adult learning environment or offer strategies that are specifically for adults. It is above average because of its message of engagement but in terms of the book's size and recycled content it is worth no more than 3 stars. Marcia, you can do better than this!"
3,Brain-compatible and Adaptable,"Adult learning theory is handily referenced in this neat little book, and it's those references that are just as valuable as the advice Tate offers for the newer professional staff developer (or anyone who teaches adults). The interested reader can follow the research to explore the subjects more thoroughly.The theoretical framework pages are useful support for Tate's activities. Though some of the material and suggestions are a bit simplistic for the adult audience(""...participants work together to create a song that shows what they have learned.""), the majority of ideas can be easily altered to suit any level of inquiry required. It's a quick read, which is also helpful to time-strapped professional developers, and it explores the newest brain-compatible strategies as it inspires creative adaptation. I would recommend this resource as part of a working library, especially for newer staff developers."
1,Flawed audio,"I adore the Buzzcocks. That's why I am so hopping mad over this release. what SHOULD be a 5-star disc is ruined by one of the most obvious audio flaws ever - the show was obviously taped on a slow recorder, then transferred to Disc at normal speed. The result: the whole thing sounds like a record or cassette being played too fast. The pitch is about a half-step higher than it shold be and everything is noticeably sped up. The only way I was able to enjoy this recording was to tape my CD, then play it back on a tape deck with pitch control so I could slow it down.This is a crying shame, because the song selection here is really good.NOTE: This is also available as part of a two-disc set called ""Beating Hearts"" which costs about half of what this single disc costs. Go figure."
4,Heartbreak Hotel,"This is a light read , but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It happens at the time I was in college, so I recognized the rules of the house and adult supervision. But I was in the North and wasn't aware of the problems these girls faced, integration.The story tells of Maggie and her enlightenment. Thank goodness it happened and the book ends hopefully, that she will go on and write more about fixing the problem."
5,I Loved this book when at Auburn 1980,I picked up this book at school not realizing it would be about Auburn. More than 20 years latter I still have it. It was the first time I read a book about the area I was in and it started a Love of that kind of story and of the author's writing. I think it is a great story for a girl at college to enjoy and really think about.
5,one of my favorites by Siddons,"I knew when I started this novel that it was a re-release of an earlier of Siddons' books, but I did not know until I read the author summary at the end that it was her first novel. Clearly, she has been a talent from the very beginning. I loved this book; I found myself crying along at the end. Highly recommended!"
2,A decent read,It was an annoying end...probably Ms. Siddons' early work and touched on some very important issues regarding blacks in the south in the 50's but just an empty ending should have carried on and been brave enough to carry one it just ended so abruptly and left one wondering what happened to the characters.
3,It's Okay.,"If you read Anne River Siddons habitually, you'll enjoy this. Light, easy, beach read. Don't rush to get it."
1,Badly dated exploration of a silly young woman's adventures,"This book was one of the most ridiculous things I ever read. Hated it completely. Characters are silly, patronizing sterotypes and the main character is particularly annoying. Despite pretentions to soulful passion for a cause, Maggie's actions seem driven by impulsive, childish dramatics. Odd to have a book about integration without one Black character who rose above Gone with the Wind/noble savage status."
5,Great conditioner to help prevent split ends,Lets just say I am currently out of this conditoner and I am thinking about purchasing a couple more packs.. Helps with my split ends..... Most important part of my hair care regimen right now.
2,Mostly Laughable,"Mr. ""Shirley"" (whose identity is now well known) was not quite as high in the CIA's Iran section as he implies, and almost all of what he learnt in Iran was already well known and widely reported. One wonders why he didn't just get a visa and travel there like all the other tourists who visit that country regularly."
4,Fascinating window into the contradictory world of today's I,"Ed Shirley is a former CIA employee who, after leaving the agency, embarks for reasons of his own on a journey through modern day Iran. A fluent Farsee speaker, he hires a guide in Turkey and is smuggled across the border. He visits and talks with everyday Iranians--merchants, professors, people he meets in the coffee houses. He encounters no hostility, open curiousity, and a generally warm attitude toward ""the Great Satan."" The Iranian people, he discovers, still like Americans--although they don't always agree with the views of our government. A wonderful travelogue and an excellent source of understanding of the complex Persian culture."
2,Hardly an accurate insight into Iranian culture,"Somewhat interesting but one can hardly wonder how Mr. ""Shirley"" has come to be an expert on Iranian and Persian culture after a graduate degree, work in the Near East office of the CIA, two American-Iranian girlfriends and only a handful of days in-country. If he had been Iranian by birth and had spent years and not days inside the country, his insights may have been more credible. One never gets the feeling he was in imminent danger despite the constant references to his mode of travel. Why didn't he visit as a tourist?"
1,Mr. Shirley was wise to use a nom de plum with this Garbage,"Mr. Shirley sneaks into Iran, hiding in the box of a truck, where he should have stayed. He spends 3 or 4 days in Iran, most of it trying not to be seen. He walks around for a few hours. He speaks to 3 or 4 truckdrivers, 2 or 3 shopkeepers, and a few assorted others, from which he assembles a complete picture and understanding of the Political and Social infrastructure of Iran. Along the way he explains, on just about every other page, how the CIA is a complete failure in every facet of it's existence, how all the career people in it's employ are arrogant idiots who are devoid of all compassion and intellect. He explains each of the Cia's mistakes, along with his explanation of what they ought to have done. He is, of course, ex CIA himself, having left it because no one there understood anything about anything."
3,"It won't help you understand Law & Order on a much deeper level, but it does get you started on some criminal law issues","I was not expecting to focus so much on mental states in criminal law, and thought we would start with elements of crimes (similar to learning about intentional torts). However, as the description indicates, this book focuses a lot on mental states, etc. As a first-year law student, I find this to be one of my least favorite textbooks. Perhaps criminal law cases are difficult by their nature since there are often constitutional issues, but the notes after the cases do little to clear some of the fog. One other annoying aspect of this book is the tiny margins (3/4 of an inch!), which make it hard to write notes in the cases as you're reading them. I think the concepts are becoming clearer, but this book could have done a better job shepherding students through introductory criminal law."
1,"I hate all casebooks, so it is nothing personal","Before you buy ANY casebook, take the ISBN and check the sell back (resale) price. Pick your jaw up off the table now.What you REALLY need is a Gilbert's Law Summary (a commercial outline) and a Case Brief Book. Use the Gilbert's to learn what you need to know and the Case Brief Book to get through the case briefs you have to do... just get them done and move on to studying for the final and the Bar exams!Get old exams for your class (or the sample essays from the Bar) and get a list of the issues that they really test us on.Then make a list of exam ready rules and definitions and practice typing them up so that your fingers know what they are typing without you even thinking about it.Make your rules fast and easy to use and your final exam and Bar essays will be less of a law exam and more of a typing test for you... and you will do fine.Best wishes for much success, always!"
3,Expected more.,The production of this cd was flat. She just went through the motions. Where were the musicians that normally back up Warwick?
1,terrible waste of money. it's basically a recap and not the advertised full show,"This DVD is not the special it claims to be in the advertisement. It's actually the recap a year later. It's very short, and not a full story at all. I am considering attempting to get a refund. Do not buy this."
1,Not long enough for the money,If I would have known that this video was only an hour I would not have spent the money. I thought it was several episodes of 20/20 on one video. It was informative but not worth the money.
5,Great as supplemental income or in place of your job,"The advice that DelDotto offers in How to make nothing but money, could generate substantial extra income or even become a full time, higher income opportunity for those who are willing to work at it.I particularly liked the chapters on distressed properties and foreclosures."
2,Del Dotto's advice doesn't pay off,"The book is ok at best. The back cover makes some grandiose claims like his financial empire is growing $20 million per year. In fact, Del Dotto filed bankruptcy in 95 or 96. John T Reed has more info on Del Dotto on his website.You're better off avoiding this one."
5,Contains a wealth of information,"I bought the paper back version of this book many years ago. There is a wealth of information such as buying merchandise, including cars at deep discounts. Buying real estate at estate sales, tax lien auctions or REO's through banks for pennies on the dollar.Pretty good booK. If you can get a copy, I highly recommend it."
5,adcock's review,"short...and very sweet.......it's dark, the snow is relentless, your only path leads through a dense and ancient wood...you grit your teeth...were those eyes flashing between the trees?...if you enter you must fly and never look back...you take one last deep breath before you spur your horse and plunge forward.......well, let the music tell you the rest......"
5,Fantastic album from start to finish,"From the first song through to the last, this album rocks! Dwight has brought so many musical styles to this album. The first songs lyrics are reminiscent of a 'George-Jones-sobbing-over-a-beer-to-a-bartender' story. Every song on this album was written or co-written by Dwight, and every song is great, not a filler in sight. From down-home country to rock-a-billy, he brings his unique style to this album, complete with country twang, (which I presume was caused by his excrutiatingly tight pants). Anyway this album is fantastic and highly recommended."
4,sizzle,"""Nothing"" is pure sex appeal. ""Sorry you Asked?"" is pure hilarity. Two of my favorite qualities in a man, and all for less than 12 bucks."
4,Pretty good,"This memory crd is pretty good, I bought one of these instead of a Nintendo Brand. But wo cares if tthis is a third party memory, its just a memory card, it can store all of your game saves and all that, it has 59 blocks which is okay but at least t didnt cost as much. So prett much if you are not the kind with lotsa money in your wallet, try getting this instead."
2,"if you love the first LP, beware!","Although A Jug Of Love is recorded and played well enough, it has none of the magic of the first LP. Gone is the mysticism and wonder of tracks like Egyptian Tomb, House With No Windows, etc. Instead what you get is a band that must have thought they were going to be the UK answer to the Grateful Dead. No thanks. I was braced for the bluesy elements but they are not even all that present. It just sounds like a bunch of stoners jamming. No real songs and Martin Stone's guitar playing is completely different than on the first LP. Pushed to the back of mix even and played clean and dry (I loved the power of Stone's guitar on the first LP). For collectors only!"
4,meatychewy,"these guys have a pretty fat vibe for what seem to be at first glance a bunch of bong haggard skate-rats. i cooked up the samples off the web and fired them, and would say they were a good brown tar, manhattan, circa 92. enough to make me wanna go score...the record that is."
5,"Great CD, very dynamic, deep sound. Soft and hard.","This is a great CD that really shows the diversity of this Sacramento,CA bands influences, everywhwere from Depeche Mode to Bad Brains. There is a lot of melodic undertones to this otherwize heavy record. You can really feel the emotion that Chino is putting into the vocals, whether he's screaming or rapping, or singing. All in all, Stephs riffs are great, and Chi complements them with his bass. Abe brings them together on drums, and Frank adds the occasional ambient sound, but the real genius in this band is that they're the best at the same time, all 5 members are vital to the sound."
4,Deftones Rock!,"I like this CD alot.But it has a few weak points like ""One Weak"" and ""Bored"".""Lifter"" pretty bad too.Buy it if you fast,hard,maddly whack music.NOTE:The best track is by far ""7 Words""."
3,Lazy + Angry = Kinda Boring,"I thought this album would be a good idea, but the truth of the matter is that Deftones seem to go best in small doses. Laid-back and spacy, yet angry and screaming, the odd combination wears thin after more than two tracks of the exact same sound. I realize they are trying to be unique, and there are some standout tunes here, but as a whole the album just doesn't grab me--it seems to be angry at the world, but too tired and apathetic to do anything about it."
3,not bad,"i like the deftones, not intensely but they're on my good list. the thing about this album i like is that it's very raw-which also is its undoing, as i think it gets repetitive but it does have its moments. bottom line, listen to it if you're angry or just want to mosh. i'm interested in their white pony album cause i've heard its much more creative and expanding their focus, plus the dj is on it. best tracks here: bored, minus blindfold, nosebleed, engine #9"
3,"Good, but nothing special","I don't know how this compares to the rest of Deftones' work, but it didn't make me an instant fan - to put it that way. While the tracks are aggressive and well produced, none of the tracks really stood out from the rest except for the last one (hidden bonus track). Because the Editorial review mentioned Tool as a reference for the vocals, I must say that Maynard James Keenan's vocal efforts far surpass that of Deftones' Moreno. It was nothing wrong with this album, it's just that the songs sounded too much the same to me.But for a debut album it's nothing to be ashamed of. Hopefully they grew on this one (but as I mentioned earlier, I haven't heard their other albums)."
4,"Hey, enjoy, it's quiet when you're dead!","This is the superior of the 2 Deftones Cd's. It is some severe agro/alt/blah/blah/blah-it defies classifaction. The guitar is screamin' and Chino's voice goes from a pretty melody to a creepy whisper, to a primal, raging scream, all in the same song. Tunes to listen for: ""Bored,""""Nosebleed,"" ""7 Words, ""Engine #9"" But all the songs are pretty wicked."
5,"Just a great album, a really great album.","This album is much better than their first. although there first album was good, this album shows that the deftones have really learned some things. This is one of favorite CD's. definitly worth giving it a try. you will enjoy it."
5,"|_D_) e f ""]["" o n e s!!!!!!!","Hands down without a doubt, in my opinion, the most awsome hardcore sound I've ever sucked into my ears. The emotions fly as Chino goes from a faint whisper to an enraged scream. And the hard & heavy guitar riffs by Stef, and Chi (on bass), mixed in with mad beats by Abe just..are...I just cant put it in words. - Matt Alexander"
5,The metal album ou there,This album kicks mass ass. Chino Moreno's vocal range is superb from softly spoken whispers to deranged and maddened screaming in the blink of an eye....definitely a must have for any metal lover.
5,Genius,"The entire album, right from the get go is musical genius. Chino's vocals compliment the music like no one else could. I love the guitar riffs, and the base lines too. If you like what I call smooth metal this album is definitely for you. Everyone should experience the listening pleasure provided by Deftones. Buy all of their albums!"
5,you cant say that...,"deftones are one of the best bands ive heard. i didnt know about them untill around the fur hit, and at that time i didnt really like them that much. My friend had me hear the cd and i was actually impressed. so i then went back to this album and liked it better then around the fur. its heavier, hip-hopier, and damn surely packed with rage. you cant say that the riffs on here are to easy, or to hard; thats not important. whats important is that the riffs fit for a rap core type style. i mean, try adding some solos, and really fast lead parts to adrenaline, wouldnt work ya know."
4,underrated,"This, the beginning of an original, heavy and at the same time, melodic band, is an honest, and worthy effort. The cd kicks off, and gets more primal, and more powerful as you get further and further in. The Deftones are unfortunately grouped with rap-metal all too often. They have a unique blend of primal rage, melody, and emotion that will captivate any listener along the ride through each album."
5,haunting,"alltough korn gets all the credit deftones was also a great influence to a lot of nu-metalbands (cold, finch, glassjaw,etc.) and with their first major release they show why. The album immediately kicks off with an amazing riff so dark and yet so catchy. Camillo aka chino moreno is one of the best metal vocalist in the world (together with maynard keenan from tool and phil Anselmo from pantera)and is capable of writing great poetic lyrics (listen to the fantastic hidden track: fist). To me this is the second best nu-metalrelease available (after life is peachy). a must have for nu-metalfanatics"
4,Deftones - yes they are good,"OK, this album is a great effort. But please, Deftones, ""Bored"" has already been done 10 times better than this by Death Angel on Frolic Through the Park."
4,An Innovative Thrash Metal Record,"This debut album from the Deftones is a raw, aggressive mix of thrashing guitars and hollow dyna vocals. The album doesn't have many soft spots and plays through like watching a horror movie on Halloween.Much more stripped down, with less texture and guitar layerings than subsequent Deftones offerings---Adrenaline is rooted more as a hardcore punk record than anything---albeit a smart and provacative punk record.This was the album that introduced the world to one of the most innovative and beautiful hard rock bands of our time, introduced a new style of soft to loud and a vocal that's as brutal as it is beautiful.It's hard to skip over any tracks on Adrenaline--but the real standouts have to be: root, 7 words, engine number 9, fireal and birthmark."
1,You'll be deaf one day,"While bands like Marilyn Manson, KoRn, and Limp Bizkit were taking all the credit for founding the roots of '90's trend heavy metal, this band was somehow lost in the translation. And it's not hard to see why. While this band is a lot better structured than most of it's kind, this album is a poor debut that fails to put forth anything familiar or decent."
5,This is Definitely the best album I could ever buy!,"This has got to be the best album I have bought! If you like stuff like Korn. Fear Factory,or Limp Bizkit, go with these guys! They rock! The lead singer has his lighter notes yet keeps the heavy feelings with a scorching scream/singing that can make you SEE his feelings. ""its one of those bands you want to yell out while walking down the street"" ( I got that quote from my friend) Buy it if you like heavier stuff."
5,Best emo hc album ever out...,"Far superior to any other album out, Adrenaline is incredible. Lyrics, music, vocals, etc will trip you all out. Buy it! Adrenaline: the best album ever out."
5,best deftones cd,"this is without a doubt, the best deftones cd out there. the vocals are heavy and brutal, the guitar and bass lines are original and catchy, and the drums are killer. It's a terrible shame that chino is such a cockjockey. The best songs on here are root, nosebleed, and engine no. 9. this is what nu-metal needs to be like. a must have cd."
5,Deftones best!,"This album from the deftones is raw, loud and awsome. So much better than the others. classic, if you want some good hxc this is it."
4,"Emo-core? No, this is metal. Deftones: Adrenaline review","This is metal. I don't get why some of the reviews call it emo? It isn't, this is real metal at its best. It is raw and unfiltered. It sounds very hard though! Note: This is a debut and not a lot of bands sound the same after their debut CD. So take that warning when you buy this CD!"
5,Limp Who? PLEASE! This is REAL heavy music!,"The Deftones are one heck of an amazing band! they are agresive but also quite meldonic! This album is extreamly powerful! With classics such as nosebleed, minus blind fold, 7 words, and bored, this album will go down in hordcore history! This band makes limp bizkit look like hanson!"
5,Well written and useful to all,In clear prose Jo Condrill outlines an incredible plan to improve the quality of your life. Developing a support team and strategic alliance sections contain amazing insights and suggestions. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
3,Not quite to Par,"Although they are really cute, you are going to want to buy insoles. The first 20 minutes my feet hurt wearing these. After slipping insoles in them they were fine. So, FYI go buy insoles!"
1,The Quiet Man Book by Des MacHale,"Des MacHale book about ""The Quiet Man"" movie is a book that drew its information and sources from an earlier book written in 1990, about the same subject, written by Gerry McNee, ISBN 1851583211, ""In The Footsteps of The Quiet Man"". MacHae's unprofessional and unkind remarks and comments in several pages through out the book about the American Actors performances demonstrates his contempt and bias feelings towards these great American Actors, (ie Ward Bond and Francis Ford). Although it contains information about this movie, it is over priced and poorly written. After all anyone can reprint information word by word concerning a movie script. It lacks depth, and historical review of several important facts about the movie and factural information about the actors, the cast and crew that played in it. It has no references and draws the majority of its information from his review of the movie viewed several hundred times. Detail and attention are lacking."
2,"FAKE: This book is from Andi Klein & Alexander Godunov, no T. Pang","The first criticism is that this is not the book of Tao Pang, the only thing that is related to the book sent is the thumbnail.The book Amazon sent to me is ""Introductory Computational Physics: Andi Klein & Alexander Godnov"".This book (Introductory Computational Physics: Andi Klein & Alexander Godnov) presents a brief (very brief) introduction to numerical methods used in the work of the physicist with C code emphasis. Overall I only recommend this book as a quick reference guide, contains many graphics to support and mathematical derivations are short and not very deep in the analysis."
4,Computational Physics,"This book is fairly well written. It is the first edition and is a little out of date when it comes to certain aspects, such as the input method in FORTRAN. The material is fairly well covered and honestly I preferred this edition to the second edition."
4,Sexy Schooling,"A gang establishes control over schoolies to distort their pocket money and milk for grades as other one protects his boss struggling to get school certificate in such a dangerous environment.Same gender affairs, paedophilia and teen sex embedded as seen by a young handsome teaching student-a section chief of boss-protecting yakuza.Of schooling might-be-funny tragicomedy is sad enough because of depicting usual rough unhuman reality of nothing-to-sacrifice society, South Korean producers customarily provide a world with."
5,Great songs = Great book,"I like the book; it is full of great well known songs, but I was a little surprised that there was not a backing guitar in one channel of the CD to play along with. I have Rock `n' Blues Harmonica also by Gindick which I love, which has one channel of harp and one channel of backing music to practice along with. I guess I just assumed it would be the same. However, I still like the book and it is very useful, especially to understand the use of bends in playing melodies. A familiar melody will help you with finding those missing notes. I am looking forward to learning the Christmas carols this season and the camp songs for next summer. Thanks, Jon, for everything."
5,Why so much?,"Nintendo's website sells these for half this price. Other store have them for like 2.99 a pack. Is this just one pack for this much? WHY?The cards are fun, and if you like collecting stuff , which is kind of the point of this game, the cards make a nice extra collection also the lay the path to making your townsfolk truly happy. The shirts they wear on the cards are the shirts you should send them.BUT as much as I love amazon, DO NOT BUY them here. This price is horrbly inflated for no apparent reason. Seriously Retail from nintendo's official site online store they are 3.29 per pack!"
1,Not worth the money,"I had all of these cards, series 1+2. I scanned them all in, and I found it ruined my game. Items that would have had to work hard for, were automatically put in the game all by scanning a card. Some of the cards just put boring everyday objects into the game. You can go onto Ebay and get a bunch of the cards for maybe 10.00. The price is worth it on here, only if you're a collector.But in my humble opinion, these cards made Animal Crossing boring, and too easy. I haven't played it since. If you're looking for the challenge of the game, don't bother with these cards."
3,"Good product, poor shipping","The product arrived quickly, but like other reviewers said, it was simply wrapped in plastic and not protected at all. I was lucky that there were no problems with it. The whole experience is strange, as I accidentally ordered the non-laminated map earlier in the week and it came in a cardboard tube, fully protected as one might expect. Both maps from the same company.I think Amazon.com needs to do a better job with their categorization and sorting. I shouldn't have been easily confused to ordering anon-laminated map when searching for a laminated one."
1,The World is Crushed,"The first time this map was delivered, it was crushed and flattened as it was NOT shipped in a mailing tube...just a plastic wrapper. Amazon customer service was very responsive and sent out a second map...that also came without a mailing tube despite my asking that it be shipped in one. Alas, I had to return the second one as well. Looks like a nice map but I will have to find it locally. I cannot understand why Amazon cannot ship this product properly.Nancie F."
3,Nice map bad shipping!!!!,"I like the map, but expected that it would be shipped in a tube. Instead it was just rolled and placed in a plastic sack and was crushed so there were lines. I was expecting to place this on the wall in my sons room so it would look like art."
5,World Map,"This is a beautifully detailed large map. I placed it low enough on a wall that my 4 and 5 year old grandchildren can see, appreciate and learn world geography. I plan on using map flags to denote places we've been, places we'd like to go and places where friends and family currently live."
4,Nice maps,I bought a world map and a map of the United States to put on the wall of my office. They are both very nice but they haven't been put up yet. They are larger than I imagined and my plans may have to change and only hang one up in the office. Vivid colors and laminate coating is lite so it doesn't make the map too bulky.
3,"Great size, color, quality",I ordered without paying attention to the layout. We live in Hawaii and my wife flies to Japan. I will look into a replacement that has North and South America in the center so my kids can be shown the flight routes for vacations and moms working routes.
4,great map,"for the price, this is an awesome map. colors are great, words are at the right size for easy reading. Good size too. We hung it in a nursey and seems like it is a good quality that will grow with baby"
3,small,"This map was much smaller then I though it was supposed to be, nice map though but not as detailed as I wanted it to be either. I ended up hanging it up in my Nieces play room."
5,nice map,"Good quality world map. It was shipped in a large & sturdy cardboard mailing tube, which the shipper bent anyway. Not Amazon's fault. It looks like someone bent the tube on purpose. Oversized diameter of tube buffered the damage to the map to a few minor wrinkles, wich I decided to accept."
1,Don't buy this from Amazon!,"I understand that these reviews should be based on the PRODUCT, but people just need to not purchase this particular map from Amazon. As other people have complained about, I received the darn thing in a plastic bag. It was crumpled and creased beyond repair so I sent it back. When I find someone else selling this map I will purchase it from them, hopefully they understand the benefits of cardboard tubes. The map itself was exactly what I wanted."
3,Not Hunter,This is interesting history but not the Stephen Hunter writing I was expecting. I knew of course it was non-fiction but there is none of Hunter's normally great writing style evident in this documentary. Stephen Hunter and Nelson DeMille are my two favorite fiction authors. If youre looking for classic Hunter dont buy this.
3,Sheds light on a bit of forgotten history,"Bainbridge and Hunter have done a service to history by giving the Truman assassination attempt book treatment. The situation in Puerto Rico at the time is a part of our national past that has long been forgotten and the authors shed light on how this led to the shoot-out in front of Blair House.What is disappointing, however, is the sheer length of the book. For an incident that lasted under a minute, 350 pages is a bit much. Also, I echo the sentiments of other reviewers who have complained about the editing. The information is so haphazardly thrown together, it's difficult to distinguish who the authors are talking about and where they are at any given point. It has no sequence whatsoever.Anyway, worth a read for history buffs."
3,"good, but not great","good research, but felt the chapter dealing with ""stream of consciousness"" of what the participants were thinking during the actual gunfight was farfetched. Could have been better if the author had stuck with a ""time line"" format as he did with the rest of the book."
2,Not an easy read,"I have read just about everything Stephen Hunter has written. I have enjoyed them all, but this one was just not there for me. It is a historically accurate account of the attempt on President Truman, but it is written in a disjointed style. It jumps from place to place, goes back in time, then forward, and then back again. I hope that this was a one time effort and is not how Mr. Hunter will proceed with his books."
3,Ten pages for each second,"Having worked in Washington as a part of the White House Medical Unit, this book caught my attention. From my perspective, the astonishing part was the remarkable change in protection and medical care from 1950 to my time-frame (1984). This was a remarkable event, overlooked for more than 50 years, and apparently mis-understood for most of that time. The inherent political terrorism of the assassination attempt, was apparently difficult then for most people to accept, but this is only now obvious, after 2001, when it would be hard to see it as otherwise. If there is such a concept as chronological parallax, this would be an example."
3,Good Story Telling,"Hunter does a good job covering a relatively unknown historical event. The writing style (constantly bouncing around) was tiresome after awhile.In addition to learning the details and characters behind this assasination attempt, the reader gains some insight into revolutionary movements, the use of sleeper cells, law enforcement training in the post-WWII era, stress reaction in a gunfight, etc..."
3,Different Hunter,"Not the usual Stephen Hunter. This reads more like a history text than anaction novel....but then, it is history, and presumably accurate history.Earl Swagger would have had a field day with these clowns."
5,This is a winner!,"This has everything you want in a good book. A great story, history, drama, and pathos. I am a history teacher and was impressed by both the depth of research and the quality of the writing.This is about 2 Puerto Rican Nationalists who, compelled by their fervent beliefs, tried to assassinate President Harry Truman in 1950. Most people do not realize how close they came to succeeding.The story alternates between historical background and a moment to moment account of the gun fight that occurred on that day.This book kept me enthralled the entire time I was reading it. I can't think of anyone who would not thoroughly enjoy this book."
3,the GREAT unknow incident,difficult read i had to skimm some but man i love history and i just never heard of this what the hell interesting fact and history but its a bit of a struggle to get to facts unlike stven hunter bhut i finished it and now as every old PR i see and so far NO ONE knows of this incident thanx ood for secret service and white house pd
2,Not strong enough-this compilation is decaf,"If this album is like coffee,it's decaf.It lacks the punch to keep one awake for an early morning drive.I'd be asleep at the wheel.I used to have this CD,but I took it to a used CD store.Its few highlights are Susana Baca,Ernest Ranglin,Thomas Mapfumo,James 'Bla'Pahinui&Ayub; Ogada.The rest are easy-listening Buena Vista Social Club.When it comes to Putumayo's themed compilations,I reccomend ""Gardens of Eden"" (sadly,it's out of print),""Music from the Tea Lands""(EXCELLENT!),""Asian Lounge"".I am looking forward to ""Music from the Wine Lands""--considering I live in the Wine Country.Hopefully,""Music from the Wine Lands"" won't be snooze-inducing like this one."
3,How can you have this CD w/o an Ethiopian contribution,Am I missing something? This CD does not have any Ethiopian music? I'm a bit perplexed by that seeing as coffee originated in Ethiopia.
2,NO ES LO QUE ME ESPERABA,"LA VERDAD ES QUE ESTE CD NO ES LO QUE ME ESPERADA,LA VERDAD ES QUE EL PRECIO NO LE HACE HONOR"
4,A nice way to start off the morning,"I recently started getting into the Putumayo series after I heard the Paris compilation. I was immediately hooked and now have started checking out the other cds in the series. MUSIC FROM THE COFFEE LANDS is my latest acquisition. While MUSIC FROM THE COFFEE LANDS may not be my favorite compilation, I certainly enjoyed listening to its international flavor. Most of the songs are latin based but there are a track here and there that are African and even Hawaiian. As I sit here typing my review while drinking a cup of joe and listening to this cd, I am imaging myself in a field picking coffee beans. I find the music very soothing tp the human soul. I definitely agree with one reviewer who questioned why there isn't any music from Ethiopia featured on the compilation given the origins of the almighty and addictive coffee bean. Overall I enjoyed MUSIC FROM THE COFFEE LANDS. It is a nice change of pace from the dark, heavy music I listen to on a regular basis."
3,I agree with the other poster,"Could have been better, however the production was crisp and clear. Good bass album though."
4,Excellent,Like most of Seraphim Rose's work this book reflects a deep understanding of Orthodox spirituality as lived by a monastic rather than taken from a collection of texts alone. This particular work continues with Rose's ongoing concern witht he fate of man and his relationship to the Creator God. The homilies fit well together and have been successfully edited to create a cohesive book. Highly recommended.
5,I recommand this book ...,"This is a scholarly and comprehensive book about Irans recent history and Mosadegh. In particular, it covers the time period 1950~1965 in great many details. I think this is a must read, as it gives great insight into events that lead to a democratic power vacuum in the late 70s. It also enables the reader to better understand the utlimate rise to power of ""Islamic Republic""."
1,CHARMED BY THE OLD DOCTOR,"Katouzian is a British university teacher of Iranian origin with megawatts of ill-concealed passion for Muhammad Mussadeq, an aristocratic politician who briefly served as Iran's prime minister in the 1950s. This is a book written by an enthusiast about his idol. It is thus impossible to treat it as a work of scholarship. Katouzian wants us to believe that whatever Mussadeq did was wise, noble and patriotic while whatever Mussadeq's political rivals did was ignoble, cowardly, conspiratorial and treacherous. This is simply too hard to swallow. Another problem is Katouzian's language which is often paralysed by jargon and at times becomes farcical as a result of his efforts to impress the reader with the choice of apparently difficult words. Although Mussadeq was a minor figure in Iran's long history he still deserves a full, unbiased and scientific biography. A READER IN LONDON."
5,Was needed for putting tile around the tub and it works,This was recommended by the manufacturer to use for tile setting around the tub. We have had it installed and the tile is going up fine.
1,Bad information for women.,"Unfortunately, Ms. Pearl doesn't give the young, old, single, married or otherwise woman any wisdom to build on. A very disappointing book."
1,Don't bother,"Ms Pearl has found a way to make money off of other peoples fame. If she or others don't like Dr. Laura, Turn your radio off."
1,"Amazon.com, I've lost faith in you since you sell this book.","Amazon.com, be responsible. Drop Ms Pearl's book. I used to suggest to friends that they try amazon.com. If you sell junk like Ms Pearl's book, I think I'll stop suggesting amazon.com to friends."
5,Over 10 years & Still going!!,Always Awesome Results!! I've used it for over 10 years! Whenever I was without it--my hair knew it! I keep it like I keep shampoo--I won't do my hair without it. It works-at least for me it does!! Now I keep two bottles on hand! It truly curbs the amount of breakage to my hair. A Wonderful hair product!
4,Pretty darn good!,"So far, this is the best leave in conditioner. It smells great, it softens my hair very fast, and keeps it from getting dry for at least a whole day. I have very thick, dry, unruly, African American hair, so I think a leave in is necessary, Im still going to try other leave ins after Im done just to see, but I think it would be hard to find one better than this. I recommend getting a spray bottle though, you can get a cheap one for $1 from any discount store, its worth it to switch it to one, its just a lot easier..."
1,Potent or potentially bad?,Usually I love Aphogee products...but this one after I used it caused some serious breakage.I must have misread my hair...but somehow I ended up with Protein overload and ALOT of my hair fell out especially the sides. I have never had issues with breakage on the front side of my head before. Use this with care.I would not use this for a while after doing a washout protein treatment while washing or as is. Dilute this with some oils or something unless you REAAALLLLY need the proteint. Stuff is potent.
3,aphogee review,This product does not put back in all of the moisture that was stripped from the hair after using the aphogee damage shampoo..My hair still felt a bit dry and needed more moisturizing after using this product.
1,It's just like water...,"I'm amazed at all the good reviews people have given this product. This leave in conditioner is SO watery and runny and doesn't help detangle or condition hair at all. I knew that it was a liquid leave in conditioner, but I was expecting it to have a slippery feel to it like other leave in conditioners I've used. This however is just like scented water.I definitely would not recommend this product. Waste of money."
4,Really like it,"I have been looking for a good leave in conditioner. When I first used it I didn't like it, but I put some Argan Oil in it that I bought from Watts and made it much better."
1,Quality not that great and the backs fell off,"I thought these looked so pretty in the picture and I must say they arrived in a nice package- you could totally give this as a gift.THe knots don't look quite as ""tight"" in real life- they were a little looser than I'd have liked, and a little bigger than I expected. The worst part however was the backings- they just didn't fit right or stay on. They were not tight enough- I think these might even have a catch like most posts of earrings do, but they still slid right off. The second time I wore them I lost both backings- and luckily was able to find the earrings. Still a little disappointed- I thought if I ordered from the Amazon brand vs a random seller it would be reliable quality. It was my first time ordering jewelry online- disappointing!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I received the CD at work, placed in in my drive and thought I would listen to one of my favorite groups. Well, I had to download Quick Time in order to see the video. Quick Time has totally messed up all of my work files and pictures and I am still trying to get it GONE! I would not recommend downloading this, despite the assurances that ""it won't hurt your computer."" I might add that I am not a computer novice.I have listened to it without the video and there is a total of three songs! I think it is a little high for what you get. And the songs weren't their best ones either.Would not recommend this even without the Quick Time problem!"
2,Reader's Digest level,"An alphabetically arranged hodgepodge of topics about African Mythology. Not an academic work, of little value other than as a Reader's Digest sort of anecdotal musings on each topic. It might be fun for some people, but totally worthless to a serious student of mythology. No credits given, no footnotes, and a terribly thin bibliography."
5,Great Book,Highly recommend any of the three series written by Rhys Bowen. They are all so different I cant decidewhich one is my favorite. Book arrived in excellent condition and has been read and put away on my bookshelf.
4,Evan Blessed [purchased at Amazon],"The Welsh Constable Evans has the best of all possible jobs - in a small, scenic town among the beautiful mountains of Wales. He also has a beautiful bride-to-be, whom he marries in this book. I have enjoyed his adventures and the description of the wild and glorious mountains. Makes me want to take a hike!"
4,Evan Blessed,"I have not read this book yet but I have read one in the series and liked it. I plan to read the rest of the series. I am presently reading the ""Molly Murphy"" series by the same author."
2,Confusing Story,"Temptations starts off well, but it gets confusing when Joan Chen's character Scarlet is killed. Then, later on, when our hero takes refuge in a Buddhist monastary, Joan Chen shows up again as Violet. Was she supposed to be Scarlet's twin sister, or what? The sex scene in the monastery, in which Chen and the protagonist are bald from having shaved their heads, is pretty erotic, but apart from that, there is no reason to see this movie at all."
2,It's just not the same..,without Rick Roberts. He was the heart and soul of this group as we all remember them.
2,One original member-good sound and picture,"This DVD has good sound and picture but the names of the players are not announced during ther concert or on the credits. Further review of this concert appearance (comparing pictures of bandmembers from past CDs) shows that the only original player is Josh Barkley (the lead guitar) and the other guitar player (singer), sax-flute player, bass player along with the drummer have been with Firefall since 1989 and are on the last 2 studio albums. This is an OK concert--just wish the band members were introduced--it was so hard to reconize them except by going thru pictures in the last 2 ALBUMS -Josh Barkley looks so different now but it is him playing lead guitar--- the DVD was taken at a concert that featured remains of other groups like Iron Butterfly and Grand Funk in 1999."
3,Firefall,"Firefall is one of my favorite local bands. The sound quality and video are not the best, but still is enjoyable."
5,Blake of IHE,"When I was a boy I dreamed is a fabulous book - it's really cool! Because it's cool that an old man dreams of stuff that he wanted to do when he was a boy. Because this book is as good as the book Go Ask Mom. It's as good as all of Justin Mattot's poems and books! Because it's really good and cool! I like the illustrations. An old man that dreams of stuff that he wanted to do when he was a boy. This old man is dreaming of the stuff, when he was a boy he dreamed of a dragon. He dreamed of a whale and a tree house. You should really read this book because there's an old man that dreams of stuff when he was a boy."
2,disappointing,It would have been helpful to have the bracelet weight for comparison to other similar bracelets. The amount of silver is this bracelet was obviously limited because of its extreme light weight and unfinished look. The ladybugs were barely identifiable. Overall quality was disappointing.
4,Worth your time!,A sad but engaging story from an embarrassing time in America's history. You'll identify with the characters and root for them along the way.
2,Meh.,"I liked the historical aspect of this book, but that was about all. The characters & circumstances were all unbelievable. The story was more annoying than entertaining."
4,convenient,"A nice, compact power adapter, I use these to charge the d.light solar products from time to time, so they accomplish that job very well. I would buy these again if need be."
1,"Feel free to order, if you don't want to receive what you want to receive.","What was sent to me is not even a Nokia product, and is not even the right connector for my Nokia X2-01 phone, which the AC-3U charger is supposed to be compatible with. Thankfully Amazon is taking it back without a hassle."
5,Review of Nokia AC3U battery charger,"Bought this as a second charger for my Nokia 5210 xpressmusic phone. Arrived quickly, works great. Totally satisfied."
1,Are imitations,"The chargers are imitations made in china, the charges are not originals, deceived people whit this, i bought but i think are originals, but they are imitations"
4,good,"I was very please with my item, it was exactly what I needed, It just took longer to receive than I anticipated. The price was very reasonable."
4,Good Charger,"I have an old Nokia phone with small pin to charge. I am planning to donate this to my brother. Its original charger was broken, so I would like to buy a charger to replace that. This is a decent Original charger from Nokia. It works!Thank you."
1,Does not work,"Seller was great & mailed item on same day I bought it.But the product does not work. I bought this for my dad's Nokia Xpressmusic 3510. His original charger sometimes does not stay put. It still charges but he sometimes needs to put it against something in order for it to stay in the phone.The new charger looks fine and fits in the phone, but did not charge when he used it. He immediately grabbed his original charger and this time, it stayed in the phone so he ended up charging with the original."
1,Photo and description are incorrect,"The part delivered was not the item illustrated, nor was it the item described. It is not a Nokia branded item and it has a micro-USB connector, not a circular one."
1,Trash,Bought on amazon it came out of the package with exposed wires and only lasted a month would not repurchase
5,Nothing to worry about,"When I ordered this replacement charger, it was cheap! I was thrilled to get exactly what I needed at a good price and have it ship super fast."
3,It works!,"It charges my phone and cost virtually nothing, so what's not to like? I don't think the quality is up to spec, so I wouldn't leave it plugged in if I wasn't home."
1,Serious failure!,"It is extremely true that NOTHING cheap is good!! (Not sure if that's actually a saying, but it is now.) Right outta the box, it SUCKED! Wouldn't hold a charge, wouldn't even register electricity! My phone cried after the experience. Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, I repeat one more time, DO! NOT! select this product. Not entirely sure about the vendor, either. Feast."
5,A great read! Get it!,It came quickly and in great condition. I highly recommended it to others. A great find if you're looking for a good resource in your spiritual growth.
4,Good product,"I really like this sight. Once I got it on, I've found it to be quite handy. However, this was a real pain to install. Because it fits so snugly (which is a good thing), it doesn't flex very well for installation purposes. This being said, I was able to install it on my shotgun, and if I can do it, anyone else can too."
2,Not a good fit on 20 ga,"My 20 ga auto was missing the bead. I tried this, but its NOT a good fit and moves all over.It might work O.K. on a larger 12ga."
3,It's okay.,"I received it with the large green sight in it, which would not for the life of me come out even using the instructions. Eventually I got it out by having the larger end break off, so now I am already down to 3 tubes after just receiving it. I'm a little pissed off with this one, as it was pretty ridiculous to ""slide it forward"" on my barrel after having snapping it on, and it even left scratches on the barrel from attempts to move it. That being said, I do like using it much more than the bead sight and would buy it again based on that and the price."
3,Great sight,"Overall this is a superb sighting device for your shotgun, but it is not without its minor flaws. First it is difficult to change out the light pipe, I broke the large green pipe the first time I tried to remove it in order to install the supplied red-pipe. The sight also slides forward until it is right up against the front bead, this is not a problem unless you don't have a front bead in which case it will continue sliding forward until it falls off or gets shot off the end of your barrel. A bit of epoxy can solve this problem, but will make the sight a permanent addition to your barrel."
3,its okay,"it looks nice & comes with 3 extra lite tubes. i snapped it onto my mossberg 500 pretty easy but the ""V"" notch didn't lock right into my hexagon bead because it wasn't paralleled with the barrel so i had to back it out tad & it all went together. BUT this isn't hard enough plastic so if you have the front notched in the back end that you look at has enough play in it to move about an 1/8th inch each way. SO basically just snapped on its only good for bird or buckshot under 50 yrds. i dont trust this thing to hold true for slugs or anything farther out. if you PRECISELY line it up and super glue it down you can probably trust it good enough but DEFINETLY NOT in a life & death situation. if SHTF i'm pulling it off. P.S. it doesn't really look that nice ON the shotgun. makes it look like a toy kinda"
3,A bit of a disappointing 2nd album,"I hadn't heard much about Queen Adreena when I bought 'Taxidermy', their first album. After listening to it, just once, I was hooked. Her intensly angelic voice coupled with the bludgeoning background music really made you feel her anguish. So the new release was eagerly anticipated.Unfortunately, it seems Queen Adreena have been listening to Kittie a bit too much, because her subtle and searching vocals now resemble quiet verses and screaming choruses. Sure, you really do plummet into the oubliette of her soul, but lost is the spine shilling, goose-pimple-causing subtleties so prevalent on 'Taxidermy'. Now its all just bludgeoning.The riffs are huge, the noise hammering, but it seems nu-metal may have caught up with them. I hope this isn't the direction Queen Adreena will take."
3,Very Good If You Don't Mind EDITED Versions.,The music of course is outstanding as you would expect from Larry Graham. I was highly disappointed in the fact that this disk contained many edited (short)versions of songs. This would have gotten 5-stars otherwise.
4,too small but excellent,"Image is sharp and clear, too bad the diameter is so small. I would gladly pay more if they made it bigger!"
4,"Yep, it definitely magnifies stuff.","I purchased this product because I work as a synthetic inorganic chemist. This involves growing lots of crystals to determine structures of compounds, so it's convenient for me to have this on hand to inspect samples when I'm not near a microscope. This can also be better than a microscope for inspecting crystals in certain types of containers (Erlenmeyer flasks can be hard to look in with a microscope). It does a good job of magnifying with no noticeable chromatic aberrations or distortion. Beyond that, there's not a whole lot to say; it's a magnifying glass: it makes things look big. I'd consider buying a lens with greater magnification, but this is fine for everyday use.I'm not giving it five stars because it doesn't mow my lawn or in any other way exceed my expectations, not because there's anything wrong with it."
1,Rip-off,"Its too small , smaller then a man thumb, it hard to focus , no light. You can't handle it because of its size. ITs plastic. Its focus because of its size is impossible. Joke and Junk."
2,Hard to assemble,My son got this Hot Wheels set when he was 4 1/2. After we put it together for him he enjoyed pushing the buttons that make the alien sounds but that was about it. We took it apart for storage and he never put it together by himself. Every so often I would assemble it and he would play it for a few minutes but it did not seem to hold his attention for long. I was dissapointed because he had begged for this toy for months after seeing it on tv. My son loves Hot Wheels sets. I just wish the company would make their toys more durable and something that could be put together by kids - maybe with not quite so many parts to get lost!
4,falls apart to easily,"my sons (5yrs, 2yr & 1yrs old)love the hotwheel shark park they like how the shark eats the cars and played with it for hour very durable. So when they came out with this alien that eats cars I figured they'd like it too and did BUT the track that the car drives along to get to the alein keeps falls Off!! My 2 year old will find it & plays with so now thew tracks all out of shape then my 1 year old carrys it off and we can't find it. Then all you are left with is the alien that jumps out and my sons don't want to play with just that part. It's a great toys if you only have 1 older child, but if you have 2 smaller kids it's not the best toy to buy the track comes off to Easily for them to break & lose!! Then know one wants to play with it."
4,I like George Benson,I bought this album cause he has some songs on there that I love listening to. So that was the reason I bought this album. The other songs on here are pretty good too.
5,George Benson Gives Us the Night.,"A supremely talented guitarist and an impressive vocalist, George Benson is one of the most influential and respected musicians in jazz/r&b. This hits collection compiles his vocal work, and track after track, it took me back to the glory years of the 1970s and 1980s. Classics include the Quincy Jones-produced ""Give Me the Night,"" the catchy ""Turn Your Love Around,"" a live rendition of ""On Broadway,"" and the memorable ""Lady Love Me."" There is not one mediocre song on this set, showing the consistency of Benson's work. Granted, there are jazz musicians guilty of delivering schmaltzy elevator ""muzak,"" but George gives us the real deal. When he sings ""give me the night,"" we have no choice but to honor his request. George Benson is the man!"
5,george benson,"As a child growing up in California my mother listen to George Benson. Now that I a mother of three I truly enjoy listing to his music and appreciate it's contents. When I'm driving in my car his music takes me to another level of accomplishment, I feel as if there isn't anything in life that I can't accomplish for myself, that's why I enjoy listening to his music it's moving and healing for the soul. So keep up the wonderful work George Benson and I'll keep listening and buying.Thank you,Lynnknight"
5,JAzzed about George Benson...,"I played it all the way through, I lOveD iT!!!My favorites are: Give me the night, This masquerade, Turn your love around, On Broadway.....but my all time favorite is: ""I just want to hang around you""....I've loved that song since I was 13....my most fav., of Mr. Benson. The quality is clear, original and the record is damn outstanding.This man is truly iconic...you must buy this CD."
5,Vocal side of Benson,"This cd definitely catches George Bensons vocal talent more anything else. He is a great vocalist and a guitar player, this cd is very good to catch the vocals."
4,Great intro,"My field of interest is in developing stronger listening abilities of English for Japanese learners. This book is looking at things from the other way round, how Japanese acquire and develop their first language, and how Japanese, as an L2 is also acquired and developed. It, being a summary of research in the field, provides an invaluable start to all the current and relevant research in the field. Valuable and informative."
3,Not So Good,"I bought this article to help me do some research in supplier development programs. The article is well written and has a lot of good information, but is lacking some KEY figures and charts from the original print. Apparently when this article was posted on Amazon for sale there was a consciuous decision to omit all of the figures, this makes the article much less effective and difficult to understand at times. If I had known this, I would not have bought this item. I hope knowing this helps you make a more informed decision, one that I could not make because I didn't have this infomration."
4,Comprehensive...,A must have book for every internal auditor as a reference. I've bought it to help me in preparation for the CIA designation..
5,Learn something new!,Wow! One is never too old to learn something.One of the saints carried this with him always and I wondered what it was all about.Good devotional also.
2,A sell-out,"This is by far worse than the extaordinary Alchemy set. Released in a period the Dire Straits didn't record anymore (just after their comeback with On Every Street which was a sell-out by its own!), it's only worth the money for the wonderful What's The Matter Baby?. For the rest, get the originals or listen to Alchemy!"
4,"Buy it for ""What's the Matter Baby.""","It is extreamly interesting to hear the boys in their original form (with brother David) hashing out their early stuff, but buy this record for the new song...""What's the Matter Baby."" Who was the genius that left this gem off of the early albums. It's sure a lot better than ""Les Boys.""Their other two live albums, though brilliant, can get a bit long winded, but this groove disk is straight meat and potatoes rock. And they serve it up hot. Live at the BBC makes me realize one of my big concert regrets is missing Dire Straits preforming live in the early days."
5,Great,"Yesterday I got this live CD at school for being good. Butsometimes the sound quality isn't as good as on ON THE NIGHTbecuase this is an older CD, but why was it released in 1995?The best songs on this are Sultans of Swing and Tunnel of Love.Get it, rocks!!!!"
3,Middling Live Album,"""Live at the BBC"" is a decent, but not terribly memorable live album from Dire Straits. It contains a mere eight songs, most of them from their debut album, including the early hit ""Sultans of Swing."" Unfortunately, the recording are not substantially different from the originals and the versions on the studio album are more nuanced and therefore superior. Of the two songs included that are not from their first album, one is an obsurity called ""What's the Matter Baby"" and the other is an early version of ""Tunnle of Love,"" that wouldn't make its studio debut until the band's third album, ""Making Movies.""Overall, this one is strictly for diehard fans."
4,Joyful,"It was a great experience for my kid, the custom was the best option on price and the delivery time perfect"
5,Omaha Beach by George Bernage,"I want to say that this is definately a keeper if you are interested in the hisory of D day. My father was on Omaha Beach and I feel it tells his story. Also tells of German side too. I seen some new photo's I have not seen in any other book I have. I am esp. fond of the book because it has the 467th AAA bunker memorial in it, before and after scenes, and that was my fathers battalion."
4,Wonderful visual history only flawed by typos and translation,"The Good: Great photos - both period and contemporary. Maps galaore. In depth interviews, stories, research.The Great: Awesome, extreme detail and so many photos I've never seen before.The Bad: Typos typos everywhere! Not sure if there are 2nd additions out with corrections but the book must have hundreds in it. I suspect it was translated from French as sometimes the English is a bit clunky and obscure. Sometimes references are made to French companies, farmers, etc. with little explanation - as if we should know them. Would have liked more background. Still, the bad only brings this down one star in my mind.The Ugly: The construction of the paperback book is more like a glorified magazine - the pages are not thin mind you, it is heavy stock. The binding is the problem. I fear that overtime the glue will separate and pages will start to fall out. I would therefore recommend the hardback book - for only a few dollars more."
2,Overpriced Release,"As it should be, this rating is for this particular release, NOT THE CONTENT.The TV show is great, it gets 4 - 5 stars.But this is another overpriced american release... 5 episodes per volume?You should never have to pay more than $1 per episode.~70 episodes divided by 5 per volume times $20 per volume???That's $280 for only 3 seasons!!!!Typically a season box is between $20- $35. They've jacked the price up because fans will pay for it. It's really sad. It happened with Star Trek, Twilight Zone, etc. I'll have to wait till they go on clearance or get the Hong Kong release."
2,Out-of-date documentary of 737 crashes,"This video was made before the latest findings about the Pittsburgh and Co. Springs 737 crashes, so it's not very interesting."
3,talking watch,"The watch works fine. The overall size of the product was a lot bigger than I had expected, it's like a large man's watch. The watch has 4 buttons on it that are easily pushed, it makes it difficult for the blind to tell the time by figuring out which button needs to be pushed."
5,He's always in my head too,"D'angelo's smooth voice can make any song great! But how does he do with a Prince cover? He slams it! I am personally not a believer in cover songs (especially Prince cover songs), but this one is really amazing! His smooth, velvety voice brings a different flavor to ""She's Always In My Head"". The original version was full of Prince guitar solos and ""Prince"" screams, this version keeps those same elements. D'angelo definitely does this song justice!!!"
5,Amazing Book!!! Buy it!,This is the best Bible Study book I've ever seen. Enough said! For about age 10/12 and up.
5,A book to be remembered,I picked this book up because like so many others my to passions are baseball and the civil war. Dyja has a wonderful way of creating characters you remeber and learn to care about even with a large cast of characters you have no problem remembering them all. The battle brutal battle scenes are very well done you can almost feel the animalistic survival instincts these men felt specifically the part when they are fighting hand to hand. The baseball scenes are also well done the wording and dialouge are fresh and vivid. This book really puts a human face on the tragedy that is war.
2,Boring.... and full of omissions...,"If you that lease or illiterate that you need this video to go over some very basic features of OS X it will guide you. Unfortunately, it is very incomplete. lacking of tips and shortcuts that make your OS X experience a pleasurable snap and the entire context of this program could be presented in some 10-15 minutes of well conceived video.The presentation is poor.You will be better off just by reading very good Apple's hep."
3,A bit to short,"Overall this is a well made documentary. But 46 minutes is far to short to potray this important historical event. I think you need at least two programmes 92 minutes minimum for this topic. The other thing lacking is we never here these criminals talk with their own voices speaking German. Its very easy to have English subtitles below while Goering, Hoess and Ohlendorf testify. The latter person was not even shown in pictures! This would have added some more precense for the veiwer and it would get crystal clear for us what mentality these people actually had. This is something wich I think is greatly missed. For all of us who dont speak English as first language, a production like this should have English subtitles all over the programme as choice in the menu. Even if I like the style of how this documentary is done, with speakers voice together with floating images and filmstrips, I am also disapointed of this production. Its not going get more than three."
3,"DVD was ok, felt it was too short","Having recently visited Nuremburg, I was interested in what would be covered. Would have liked for it to have been longer and to have had more detail."
1,blue tooth review,"The blue tooth arrived promptly and we set it up to charge. However it would not hold the charge and after conferring with the company, it was determined to be defective. The company wanted to see my charge on my credit card which I declined to do, not believing that than information was relevant."
3,A smashing review,"Smash palace is an important movie to be seen by recovering race car drivers considering moves with wife/kids to rural areas in the English speaking world. It shows the consequences of disregarding your master's (spouse's) wishes and the supreme importance of self control. As a bonus, at movies' end one is left with hostage control technique I had never considered using.Note Well: Title is clever, British slang for auto junkyard, (or graveyard as the de'ath obssessed would say)"
3,Smash Palace,"I saw this film (from New Zealand) back in the early eighties, on a premium movie channel and have never forgotten it. It was light at first, whimsical and fun, but then became dark and even scary. I found it compelling and memorable, worthy of a revisit. In fact, I have been searching for it since then, to add it to my library. I recommend it, but caution all about a disturbing adult scene between an hurt,angry husband and a remorseful wife."
3,Eh,"It's a big book with pretty pictures but it's not a comprehensive guide to all things dinosaur so much as it's a good summation. It handles a lot more of the post dino era than what we were hoping for as well as a lot of relation to when they turned in to what mammals and all that. It's an okay edition if you're looking for a compendium of how all things relate but it's more a ""Prehistoric Encyclopedia"" than a ""Dinosaur Encyclopedia""."
5,Neck Pain Relief,"Duro-Med Soft Foam Cervical Collar 3 Width, White, MediumThe item arrived on time and the price was less than the drug store. The collar is comfortable and good therapy for neck pain. It helps to ease pain and relax the neck muscles by limiting motion and holding the head up. The bulging discs in my neck have improved by wearing the collar a few hours a day, usually during the evening when muscles are tired and sore. It's a quality product and I recommend it. I would buy another when this one wears out. It's built with quality. Be sure to measure between your chin and chest to get the right size."
1,What a let down! A disgrace.,"DO NOT BUY. You can't rate educational value, because the child is so disappointed when they touch something and it falls off!! It is only an education to the buyer not to purchase from Breyer. A carrying case too? I'd forgotten that was what it was called since the cupola snaps off immediately (as do the other parts). I purchased and assisted in the assembly with this for a 4-yr old horse lover. What a shame to the Breyer name. I am a horse lover and always thought of Breyer as THE name for horse collectibles. I cannot believe the poor quality put out by the company. DO NOT BUY. Everything snaps off, stickers peel off. The quality is soooo bad. Breyer should be refunding anyone that purchased this item and do a recall on batch numbers and claim machine malfunction.I purchased a solid wood barn for under (...) just prior to the holiday for my own 5-yr-old daughter. It would have been worth the original asking of (...). It holds all of her horses and other animal friends."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","This was a real let down for my daughter. She loves horses and has several Breyer horses. When we saw this paddock she was so excited about it. We decided to get it for her for Christmas. It is very flimsy, does not stay together and breaks easily. She spent more time trying to fix it than actually playing with it. After a couple of weeks it was just completely not worth the effort and we put it up but later threw it away, only the doll and horses were salvagable."
3,"Stickers don't stick, too delicate for a boy","My son is obsessed with horses, and loves this toy. The stickers, and there are many, don't stick well. So each time he plays with it another sticker is lost. My son received several Breyer toys for Christmas. It is frustrating to both of us, that the toys are not standard size. That is, his veterinarian doll is way too big for the horses that fit in this Paddock. And Breyer makes horses of different sizes, so some of them fit in his horse trailer (also Breyer) and some don't. Everything that was Barbie (Mattel) fit - she fit in the car and the house and on the horse, etc."
4,Miladys State Exam Review for Art and Science of Nail Tech,I am currently a liscenced nail techician in the State of California. I moved to Nevada and discovered that the liscence is non-transferable because California does not belong to the National Examination. This Review helped me pass my written exam with no problem.
3,A little disappointed,"When I ordered this ""book"" I was expecting a few practical tests to get myself ready for the State Exam. Not only were there only 2 practice tests, but the other part of the ""book"", which is no bigger than a Playbill, were chapter reviews that I did in school. Quite disappointing to pay $45 for 2 practice tests which did not include any questions about Pennsylvania code. I understand that this book was a general book created for any state, but perhaps Mylady could create one for each state. Here's hoping I pass anyway."
3,the time goes by quickly,"Getting my aging body out of bed at 6:30AM to exercise is a lot easier with this video. These girls are attractive, not gorgeous, and slender, but not model-sized. The funny thing is, if you do these exercises right, you won't be able to see the screen for about half of the video. And if you're looking for porn, you could do better--there are NO crotch shots. It's about as tasteful as it could be for 3 surgically enhanced women rolling around on a carpet. It's not very good porn, and not very good yoga instruction, but it's a pleasant alternative to the usual sports bras and pony tails (now, if only THOSE girls could strip!)."
4,"Naturally beauties in motion, but beware of picture quality","A significant improvement over Nude Stretching with its lethargic zombies doing unchallenging exercises. The women are natural looking, generously proportioned, and look like they actually do this stuff when they're at home. Beware of picture quality - at least one segment is rivaled in quality by the Pam and Tommy Lee home video."
3,wrong tape?,"I ordered nude yoga and what I got had a preview of what would be on the yoga tape but the rest of the tape was nude stretching, which was O.K. if it meant the entertain and not really teach anything. I believe that a few house wives with a camcorder could do better."
3,"SHOWS PROMISE, SHOWS YOGA, GETS BORING FAST","I give it 3 stars because 2.5 stars is not on the scale. There are plenty of worse tapes if you appreciate the female form. It starts off nicely. With 2 models performing, camera front on, the girls strike a couple of interesting and provocative poses. This lasts about 15 minutes, then everything goes downhill. They drop to one model per pose. The living room they film in is too small, the camera is poorly positioned, the 2nd camera is very dim. Overall picture quality is poor and fuzzy. For five bucks or less, its worth it. I won't throw it away."
3,The truth about this one IMHO,"Everyone seems divided on this one. ""It stunk"" ""It was great"" Truth is, It's OK. The models (4 of 'em, though 2 look very similar) are attractive (6-8.5), but they do look like they have never done the positions before (ie. very wooden; -1 star). Looks like a couple of them have had some ""work"" done, but I have seen a lot worse in magazines. It lost 1 star for me because of the picture quality; again, I have seen a LOT worse in other adult features, but I have seen a LOT better too. Overall, not too bad; if you want to see some attarctive women do yoga naked, get it. Your humble honest evaluator, Joker J"
4,NIGHT TRAIN OF OLDIES TIME SQUARE EDITION,"great cd for the hardcore doo wop collector--this is the Times Square Edition --For those of you who did,nt live in the New York Area ~Times Square Records was a place were collectors went to buy and sell records I beleive one of the first to charge a premieum for hard to find record . what we have here are 30 great doo wop tracks ~the kind of hard core down and dirty doo wop played on slims radio show back then--don,t expect some slick packaging . just some great hard to find sounds -"
2,Crappy.,"I got this timer and it's is unbelievably loud when you push buttons and didn't work more than one hour without breaking. go for a more expensive one not for the looks, you'll be happier with something that has working buttons. And not some cheap-o crappy wanna be double timer."
3,Revision & Expansion Required.,"I agree with 'icappleg' that the book sorely needs an editor, or plainly a new author to get some of the ideas across. There are so many clutter words, and poor sentence structure that it does indeed make it quite a task to sift through this book.When you do get through it, you are able to find a few gems worth taking with you. But I must say, you have to be careful picking up these gems for they ARE timeless, yet there are many ideas the author places in his book that are NOT timeless. They give away the science and research of his day. Thus, a Revision, Expansion and maybe a whole Revamp of this book is required for this book to get any more than 1, 2 or 3 stars at the most."
1,This book needs an Editor!,"Writing should be clear and simple; the writing in this book is neither. It reads as if MacGregor knows he is highly educated, and desperately wants you to know it too. The book is a plethora of intricate, paragaph-long sentences -- verbosity for its own sake. MacGregor basically says nothing once you take the time to diagram and analyze a sentence to find out what his point may be. It is very tiring to slog through even a few chapters.MacGregor's complicated, tedious writing style drowns the book. If you want to read an intelligent, yet graspable, account of Reincarnation and Christianity -- this isn't it. Don't waste your time."
4,Remembering A Man Who Didn't Forget,"Anyone who looks upon the acquiring of any kind of new knowledge with glee will appreciate this memoir. John Francis Kieran, Sr. did not limit himself to the subject of sports of which he was the most learned columnist about it for the New York Times. The fact that he put behind fifteen years of sports to write on natural history and other matter for the rival Sun is evidence of that fact. He was also the toughest panelist to stump on ""Information, Please"" for which John Kieran was beloved by the program's devoted audience. The reader will make an erudite friend of the author and no mistake."
2,Good sound but not very practical,"Got these when they first came out and used them sporadically ever since. Sound quality is excellent - much better than Apple standard-issue earbuds, but they are NOT sound isolating at all. the silicone ear-tips just sit lightly in your ear. Not only does this provide no isolation at all, but they pop out of your ear with the slightest jarring. Unusable for jogging or any real activity. Have tried different tip sizes to no avail. And as other reviewers have said, the tips also pop off very easily. When I spoke to the company they said they specifically chose not to do a better seal in the ear in order to avoid the vibrations of walking or running from traveling up the wire to the ears. Bad trade-off in my opinion, and I much preferred my Shure headphones..."
2,Beware!!!!,"Awesome sound as would be expected from Bose. The way they sit in the ear does take some getting used to, but after a day or two they're just fine. The problem is durability, I have a pair and so does my wife. Both pairs have shorted out on the receptacle end, which takes Bose a few weeks to fix. Now my left ear bud is shorting out and I have only had my set since July 2009!!! Sorry Bose, but I've had enough..........."
3,Little flimsy,"This product was a little flimsier than I expected, and isn't able to ""carry"" my portfolio in it, due to the weight restrictions. In addition, the company logo is best suited for /inside/ in lieu of out. In retrospect, I should've bought a smaller one with some sort of lining."
4,Great collection of singles from awesome overlooked band,"If you like the Kinks and Pink Floyd and the do-it-yourself work ethic of the punk movement, you'll love this collection of singles from one of the great overlooked bands. They've been around since the late 70's/early 80's with Dan Treacy's sharp, simple songwriting and his off-key but it works singing. If you aren't moved by Part Time Punks or Smashing Time or Now You're Just Being Ridiculous, you must not have a heart! Be ready to have these lightweight gems stick in your head all day."
2,Who are these guys?,"I never heard of this band until I was browsing allmusic.com and they happen to mention them in the Pink Floyd listing.I have been quite the Anglo-file for about 40 years now and I never heard of them! After giving them a listen, I know why!Nirvana and other U.S. band were influenced by this?!Do me a favor, check out Gang of Four, they got it all over these guys!"
4,Best one I have,"Opened the package, installed it, and it has been running with no problems for the last six months. Never any problem reading or loading disks, and the 52X write speed is really fast. The only drawback I've found is that the cooling fan makes a lot of noise right next to the computer when I would rather hear the sound effects of a game or music."
3,Great Background Music,"This is a great album...in the right circumstances. If you just sit around and listen to it, it's boring. However, it is probably the sexiest album of background music that I've ever found. Terrific music ..."
3,you're ok...,"i love k.d. lang, but i have to agree that this really is not one of her greatest efforts. i certainly don't think it's a bad album, but ""shadowland"" and ""drag"" and others are a lot better."
2,Singing the phone book,"You know the cliche, ""so and so could sing the phone book and it would be great."" Well, like a lot of cliches there is a lot of hyperbole involved and this album by kd lang proves it.The man problem here is that, while lang is in great voice as always, most of the songs here are indeed about as interesting as the phone book. After repeated listening a few songs, most notably ""You're OK,"" and ""Maybe"" begin to rise above the others, but even they fall short of many of the lesser tracks on better kd lang albums.My guess is that this album was rush job which her record company put lots of pressure on her to finish after the surprising commercial success of her previous album ""Ingenue,"" but as the corporate labels have never seemed to lean you can't rush great art and when this album proved to be a commercial disappointment the label backed off, let lang take her time and she produced a magnificent follow-up album in ""Drag,"" the album this one should have been in the first place."
2,Even the best stumble,"I'm a big kd lang fan. A big one. But this album really does not do much of anything for me. By and large it is a tuneless mess. Give me ""Angel With A Lariat,"" ""Absolute Torch and Twang,"" ""Ingenue,"" or ""Drag,"" over this one any day."
2,Meh,"bAfter leaving country music with her album ""Ingenue,"" a wonderful smoky, torchy collection of chanteuse songs KD Lang returned with this disappointing follow-up.Things kick off to a marvelous start with ""If I Were You,"" ""You're OK,"" and ""Maybe,"" but quickly sink into songs in which she tries to make up for the absence of melody with mood and with her still remarkable voice. Lucky for Lang fans she quickly returned to form a few years later with the magnificent album ""Drag"" and its tour de force centerpiece ""Til the Heart Caves In."" Get that CD and skip this one."
1,Re-hashed trash: Horrible songs in the same vein as Ingenue,"This is a blatant attempt to cash in on the kd 'smooth' sound that dominated Ingenue, except the songs are at best horribly derivative of Miss Chatelaine or Constant Craving, or at worst, hopelessly boring. ""Sexuality,' is an ok number, but it's plainly a retread of constnt craving without a hook. She should've just kept writing or gone directly on to Drag; maybe the record company forced her to put a new cd out too fast. At any rate, buy it in a used cd store if you have to have it. This will go down as her worst effort ever."
2,"Great vocals, dull songs","While kd lang is unquestionably one of the finest vocalists in music today, ""All You Can Eat"" is not one of her better efforts. Her voice is in as fine a form as ever, but the problem is the material which leans heavily towards the dull side. Apart from ""Maybe"" and ""You're OK"" there is nothing especially memorable on this CD. Stick with ""Drag, ""Ingenue,"" or ""Absolute Torch and Twang."""
1,Avoid,"I have about 20 clients using quantum tape backup - all work well except this particular one.One of my customers has it. Gives trouble about every 3 months, and have to update firmware, drivers and reboot server to fix. Quantum reps give different reasons why it's not working, but one thing in common - they can't fix it!"
3,Intellectual Erotica,"This year's volume of erotica is similar to the others in that it contains a couple stories that really turned me on, some that were mildly arousing, and a couple that were just hard to read. The problem I find is that some of the stories are to experimental and poetic. I'd rather not read about the AIDS crisis or world poverty within the context of erotica, which I consider to be an escape from the harsh aspects of life. But that's just my personal preferance. I know others feel differently."
5,A very cute and endearing tale of friendship!,"The illustrations were what drew me to this book. They were very colorful and eye-catching. The story kept me entertained from cover to cover. I laughed and enjoyed this story of a kind-hearted dog (Joe) and his new friend, the one-legged seagull (Hoppy). Very cute!"
4,The Martial Art Spirit,"The Bible of Karate, ""Bubishi"" is a good title for this book. The Bubishi must be in every true martial artist library. This particular translation has a lot of commentary by McCarthy. His translation is accurate, and his commentary is not out of line. But I prefer literal translations, with my own mind being used to interpret what was meant. (As I feel this book was originally intended). This is the second translation of the Bubishi that I have added to my library, and I consider both copies very important to my collection. I believe that martial artist can benefit by reading this book."
4,Worthwhile but Incomplete History,"Karate students will enjoy this historical review of different styles, karate masters and basic techniques. Just keep in mind that more complete historical material is available. Structured martial arts have been around for thousands of years. Bubishi picks up some vague notions of how various fighting arts mingled with the native arts of Okinawa just a few hundred years ago. Also, don't expect to find useful medicinal recipes or self-defence techniques."
5,An authoritative historian and martial artist,"There are so many myths surrounding karate, particularly its origins and its relationship to Chinese martial arts. In part it is because there are few true sources of historical information, and in part it is because people want to believe the myths. McCarthy's work cannot fully demystify the past, but at least he has conducted his research and written an authoritative document that the rest of us can use as a starting point. I found him thoroughly credible--a respected martial artist and a detail-oriented researcher. He identified ten possible theories of how the Bubishi was transmitted from China to Okinawa, and rather than try to force any viewpoints along, he states the strengths and weaknesses of each. If any particular style or school is bent on believing one version or the other, they are welcome to, but this book establishes that the history is not so simple."
4,Little Disappointed,Only because the product does not come with a canister of fuel. And the fuel is not carried by Amazon. Or REI. Or many other online retailers. It appears to be a scarce commodity. I did scour the Amazon ad to see what was in the package and came away unsure. The photo shows both the stove and the canister so I took a gamble. Now I have to hunt around for a fuel source.
2,ffigure fuel costs,"The pocket rocket is certainly compact and will heat your food, but you will be lucky to be able to warm two meals with a single fuel canister, and they cost about five bucks a piece. If you plan on an extended hike, be prepared to shell out for fuel and rent a mule to carry the necessary number of canisters."
2,pocket rocket,The picture shows the stove with the canister. But it only arrived the burner part no canister. So I need to buy another thing now
2,Adequate Beginner Stove,"The flame creates too much of a hot spot & doesn't spread evenly across the bottom of the pot or pan resulting in scorching. If you're just boiling water, it's okay. The fairly good wind resistance is negated by the flame blowing out at lower settings. The pot supports bent after being heated 12 minutes while supporting two liters of water, roughly 4+ lbs. Granted this is a little heavy for any solo stove & more than one would normally boil for single or even double usage, but no other stove I tested had this same result. MSR makes many good stoves but the ""Pocket Rocket"" isn't one that I would recommend. There are many better canister stoves on the market."
5,Space saver; ultralight; great for low-impact camping,"The MSR Pocket Rocket was so easy to set up and use! My 1.7L pot fit nicely on top and did not slide around. If you're not going to be in a position to haul firewood with you backpacking or want to have a quick and easy meal on the trail, this stove is the way to go."
2,Very unstable,Have it for almoust 3 years. Its' really small and light - which makes it great for backpacking.Also it's very unstable - few times ended up with the pot falling off of it. On a level surface. These 3 legs do not open fully and don't provide enough traction for a pot to hold on.I ended up holding the pot until water starts boiling. Really frustrating.
4,Great lightweight stove,"Good little stove. Very light weight. I would give Five stars for this, but, for longer hikes (8-12 days) you need two canisters and at higher elevations and the colder it is you have to palm the fuel tank to get a stronger burn. Its slightly tipsy if you are unlevel or do not center your pot well enough. I recommend aluminum to distribute heat faster and more evenly. Lastly, I wish it came with a wind protector of some sort. Its a little small but hey thats why I bought it! Overall it is still a pretty good addition for a lightweight backpacking trip."
2,compactness and light weight comes at a cost- tipsy,"I've had this burner for 4 years, and I've come to the conclusion that the few ounces you save in weight with this stove aren't worth the hassle. Frankly, it is tipsy. You see how in the picture each leg has a flat spot for the pot to rest on? Well in reality the legs do not open all the way, and the pot ends up resting on three points, the ""elbows"" of the three arms. This is precarious and if your pots have anti-stick coating on the outside, forget about it. When water starts to boil the bubbling action is enough to threaten to topple everything over. I have spilled boiling water on my hand because of this.Overall this product should only be considered by those who place a very high premium on minimizing their pack weight. For all others it's worth getting a slightly heavier, but more stable model."
4,Good deal,"Overall, I like the pocket rocket. It's easy, compact, lightweight and effective at boiling water. However, because the flame is essentially a torch, it would not be appropriate if you'll be sauteing or frying fish or anything like that. So if you're a backcountry chef, look elsewhere. If you just want pasta or dehydrated meals, the pocket rocket's price can't be beat."
5,Performs perfectly after years of use!,"I have had this stove for about 8 years and it still works as well as the day I got it. I have used it close to 100 times. The only complaint I have is that if you need to simmer something like pasta, you have to constantly stir it or it will get burnt to the bottom of the pot due to the concentrated flame. Other than that, this thing is awesome. It boils a good size pot of water in about 3 minutes. A few people have said that it is tipsy. That is true if you don't put it on flat ground. If you have a nice base, it is pretty darn stable. The size of this thing is amazing. I have an MSR fold away pot and this fits inside with my squishy bowls and utensils. I would recommend this thing to anyone."
2,Barely up to the job,"While this company is responsive, and promptly sent me a replacement part after one was damaged in shipment, this product is not up to the job it is expected to do. After installing it, I had to make several adjustments to the handles and linkages to make it work. On the second load of dirt in my little cart, the handle bound up and bent the jack shaft beyond repair. Luckily, I had another jack that I could use to replace the piece. It doesn't lift the cart high enough to dump its contents. It only lifts to about 35 degrees and it needs to go to at least 50 to automatically dump everything. It's an OK product, but light duty. It needs more engineering. I'll have to give it a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10."
1,Average,"Made for ok reading, but the chapter by Kern Singh was especially boring and poorly written."
3,Mycodox Odor Neutralizer,"I bought two bottles on line. The product works well, but I had to change the liquid to a different bottles. Time consuming and irritating."
2,Where's He Going to Go Next?,"many good poems, but there's so much irony in this book that when you get to poems like Tonette the poet sounds like a hypocrite. how'd erma bombeck get into the room? ""bad people"" is a weird mix of nostalgia, empathy and disapproval but ends up feeling parental (ask your mother) and hence cliche. ""Other Pages"" reads like a page torn from the Frank Bidart handbook ""Emotional displays through Typography."" and haven't i seen some of these poems before, in Tasker Street? the poet seems to have painted himself into a corner here."
5,Profound Insight,I have read this book over and over and each time am amazed at the deeper meaning I find. It is truely the work of someone with great wisdom and I feel grateful to have found this book.
1,Horrible Coin Slabs. Buy Coin World Premier Instead,All I will say is if you want to have to glue the cases together so they don't fall apart then these cases are for you. I thought I would try these since they were much cheaper then the Coin World Premier Slab holders. I found out the hard way that saving some money doesn't always equate to finding a good product. Don't waste your money like I did.
5,Another call for cds,I'll add my voice to this Main Refrain - how about some more Wendy Waldman on CD?
3,"Contents are superb, but spoiled by bad organization.","As prior reviews state, the text is well-selected from Powell's journal, and the photographs are superb. But how can the author publish the journal of an explorer without a map keyed to the dates of journal entries? The photographs are superb, but again, not keyed to a map, or even associated with the text. The identifying data for each photo is listed in the front of the book, but is not given on, or near the photograph. A potentially superb book, but, because of these defects and faults, one that is maddening to read."
4,"Fancy, fancy, fancy","This book's photographs are gorgeous--though there's not enough of them--of snow covered mesas, sacred datura, Bryce Canyon (which isn't really on the Colorado at all), streambeds, waterfalls, canyon walls, cactus, clouds, and shadows.The introduction is by conservationist David Brower, and is a little pretentious, but most of the text is straight from explorer John Wesley Powell's own account of his trips in the late-1800s, and the photos do a great job of making that text seem especially readable.There are A TON of books about the Colorado River and the Colorado Plateau...and this...this is another one of them. It's a good one though, and worth considering--whether you're obsessed with reading every single book on the subject, or whether you'd just like one nice one to leave out on your coffee table."
1,Buy Huggies Supreme instead,I bought this diaper because of it's name. I thought it would be a good bed time diaper. I was wrong. My daughter went from sleeping all night (when she was in Huggie Supremes) to waking three times. Buy the Huggies Supremes. I also recommend buying them one size bigger than your child is currently wearing.
3,High price,"I would give these diapers 5 stars, but I paid too much. I normally trust Amazon pricing and this time I got ripped off. Buyer Beware."
3,we still get leaks,"My 2 year old drinks a lot and we have leaks every night. The overnites seem to hold more than other diapers but I still can't get through a single night without changing clothes, sheets and mattress pad. I tried different sizes in case one size was to big or small."
5,"Dry Baby, Dry Pajamas, Great Fit, No Leaks","My son used to wake up with wet pajamas and wet bedding with the other more expensive brand, rhymes with Hampers. Huggies overnites are super absorbent, and fit perfectly. Parents have enough to worry about--keeping baby dry at night isn't a worry with Huggies Overnites. Try them, you'll love them."
1,Very poorly written,"I'm with the reviewer who threw her book away. My husband sells books so I donated it to his pile. I couldn't finish it; it's a hodgepodge of thought tossed together in no particular order. I am actually shocked at how someone with a doctorate in philosophy could agree to have this book published in its current state. By the way, I am somewhat sympathetic to traditional Catholic teaching on roles for women -- I'm just not sympathetic to expecting people to pay to read bad writing!"
5,Dressing with Dignity,Mrs vonHildebrand's well-written book is an interesting and original study of the differences between men and women. She exalts the nature of the female person to heights previously unknown in any Catholic literature excepting the free-from-original-sin status the Virgin Mary. [...]
5,major cult fan!,"well here's my story:i used to here the song she sells sanctuary on the radio, and thought it was way cool,so i always listened for it ,then i heard wildflower and thought that also was cool so i went out and bought high octane cult and was blown away! every song was better and better so to all you beginners out there start with this you wont be sorry, i wasnt! also you might want to by love,that is one excellent cd!well as for high octane... my fav tracks are:2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,15 oh hell the whole cd is great, enjoy!"
2,Weilerstein Debut,"I've been playing the cello for almost 40 years and I agree about the complaints about the vibrato and phrasing: overdone! I also agree with the question about ""aristocratic"" playing: why all of the exaggeration? Instrument playing should ideally be like that of a vocalist, where one is not limited by one's technical abilities. I doubt that Ms. Weilerstein would sing these phrasese the same way she plays them. There is still time for her to develop, however. If you want to hear more refined playing, listen to Gendron, Rose, Fournier or Rostropovich."
2,"""Genius""","This cellist was recently awarded a genius grant. Just goes to show the sad state off affairs in music IMHO.The poor girl has no emotion and these pieces are simplistic at best, a pity that this is how tax payer money is wasted."
2,disappointing,"after so much hype, i was disappointed by this cellists tone,technique and overall musicianship"
2,powefull,I am a cellist of 15 years on the breakthrough of becoming a renowed cellist. This cellist tone is so powerfull and clear.she tells a story this is so clear to understand because the music speaks. alisa should watch the slurs from the f to b and be more gracefull. The apres un reve was ok i guess. she really should of tooken more time. like floating on a dream cloud. when i play this piece i take the music from the begining as a fuzzy dream and play the pitch so the music tells a story and becomes more clear every measure. The elgar is somenthing she might not want to touch because no one plays it better than du pre.
2,Ok I Got It To Work!! 4 stars now,"This product is not easy to use! I'am not able to have this clock pick up a signal, despite placing it next to a clock that picks up the same signal.! After many tries and moving it all over the house it still can not find the signal! I have two (2)other brands that can.The directions are poorly written and are very confusing. The product is going back to Amazon. I've used many electronic clocks and this is by far the worst.OK......After Some work I got the clock to work. The trouble was that it came with the radio signal turned off and when I figured that out it works great. 4 stars"
2,It doesn't change time zones . . .,"The clock does everything an atomic clock should do except that it refuses to change time zones. Five request to Seiko customer service has failed to get a response...some customer service.If I could return it, I would but it was beyond the warrenty period when I first traveled to a different time zone only to find it malfunctioning.Anyone have any luck getting this beast to change time zones?"
1,Be careful. Be very careful.,"This small, light travel alarm carries a shipping weight of 7 lbs! Could be a typo or could be a way for the seller to jack up the price. Either way, shame on Amazon for not polcing its marketplace better."
1,"Poorly constructed, did not perform to the advertised specifications.",I returned the Alarm clock within a week. It would not pick up radio signals for setting the time equal to my old RadioShack alarm clock When placed side to side in the same location. Actually it never pick up any kind of signal.The controls were cumbersome and it was difficult to set the clock.
2,A Real Pain,"If you have finger tips the size of a pencil point, you may be able to set this thing. The tiny buttons are on the back and you're trying to see the results on the front at the same time you're pushing the button. If it sets itself automatically, it works well. If you have to set it manually, good luck. The instructions are printed in about 4 point type, almost impossible to read."
4,"Works great, but lacking some helpful features","I've had this alarm clock for 2 months.ProsPicked up the radio signal well, but took a while when i first turned it on.large easy to read display.easy to set the alarm time,Very happy with it.Minor annoyances:1. the alarm does not have a reset button. So one needs to turn the switch off then back on to reset it for the next day.2. Its loud. it wakes my apartment mate in the next room if i don't turn it off quick.July 2011 update: 2-1/2 years, still on the original battery. switches to DLS time and back to standard automatically. Love it"
2,Seiko Disappointment,"In daylight, it is hard to read the display from any angle other than straight on 90 degrees/perpendicular.The (yellow/orange) light emanates from a small, bright spot in the lower-right corner which does not light the screen uniformly, fading across the screen not quite illuminating the upper-left corner.Setup is not intuitive; it would be nearly impossible to set/use this clock without the Instruction Manual."
4,Seiko travel alarm,"With but one exception, I consider the Seiko travel alarm (with ""atomic"" time and room temp) terrific for use both at home and on the road. It's reasonably compact for what it features and is nonetheless easy to read. The sole exception is that it has no volume control for the alarm; I do not need to hear it as loud as it is, but it can wake my wife as well as waking me. I muffled the ""speaker"" with cotton."
1,Shouldn't buy,This clock does not receive the timing signal. It is not made in Japan where the product quality and control is better. Better to go to [...] and get one that works for about half as much.
