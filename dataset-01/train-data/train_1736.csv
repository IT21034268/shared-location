3,Too sweet for me,"I've been using NOW isolate for over a year and thought I'd try something new. The protein value of the Isopure is the same, but it's really sweet in that artificial sweetener sort of way. It also mixes a little differently. If you like the artificial sweetener taste, this will work for you. But get a small order first. Going through 7.5 lbs will take me some time (I'll cut it with NOW)."
3,"Tastes pleasant, but nothing like mint","I almost always turn to Isopure zero for my low carb protein needs. I wanted to get something festive for Christmas, so mint chocolate seemed like an obvious choice. The problem is... IT TASTES NOTHING LIKE MINT! Or chocolate. I think it tastes like vanilla. I even tried putting it in chocolate milk, but it's still not noticeable. So while it tastes pleasant, it was still a bit disappointing."
3,it may work well but can't get past the taste,wanted to try this since a friend spoke highly of it...however I can't get past the taste so.....won't be keeping it
4,good product,"I have already bought a product from the same seller.And as I liked the first time, I bought one more time.And the product and the seller was really good."
4,Excellent product,"Excellent product, very good, the taste is not so good but if you mix with another flavor like cocoa is good."
5,Excellent protein source!,This is what you're looking for if you want to cut back on those little extra carbs that other supplements have.
5,Taste Counts,"This is product is 50% more expensive than the grocery store protein, but it is 1000% better in taste. It's the best I have tried - no bitterness, over sweetness, or aftertaste. It is also sold in 7 1/2 pound buckets for a little more of a price break. Amazon used to sell it, but as of July, 2011 it is not available."
5,Good for protein powder,Very happy with the powder. Dissolves completely in water with little effort. Taste is ok... its protein powder. And the ingredients are just what I'm looking for.
4,good stuff taste like garbage,i got the vanilla flavor DONT DO IT haha its good stuff works good ive seen results from the marines around me taking it and ive had it for about a week and definatly see it helping but do not get the vanilla flavor it smells great but taste like garbage and im mixing it with bottled water so i know its not the water
2,a let down,Had a few things that might be useful but for the most part was not what I was hoping for..
2,he's really out there,The book is worth the read if you didn't pay for it.He is really out there in paranoid land.I didn't learn much from this but thats just me.Unless your as paranoid as he is you will think it's silly.A little common sense goes along ways.
3,Average Info on Burying Things,"All in all, worth the low price. Good tips on what to do and mistakes to avoid. At best, this is a basic primer if you are looking to bury something and are not interested in highly technical info. I would buy it again.Dave"
3,some good info,the book goes a LOT more in depth about where to hid things where people wont look than the practical application of how to bury them. it also had far to much of a... tin foil hat approach than i would have preferred but overall it had enough good info to make it worth while.
3,Interesting but a simple book,This book does give a lot of info that is basically simple and common sence stuff. Has some interesting places to hide stuff but doesn't tell you in a step by step guide. Rather you have to figure out how to do the things mentioned.
3,Smuggled Chinese,"This is an interesting book, an obvious result of extensive research. It best serves as a historical reference tool for anyone interested in the crisis of Chinese being smuggled to the U.S. in the 80's and early 90's. That is also its shortcoming, since it lacks any reference to more recent events related to the smuggling of Chinese into the U.S. This was a major disappointment to me for a book published in 2000. The book would be well-served to be updated with reference to new routes being used by smugglers; the INS Global Reach program, new offices in China, and efforts to disrupt the smuggling trade; the Chih Yung interdiction and other boats stopped off Mexico and Central America; the Spring 1999 influx of smuggler's ships in Guam and Tinian; and the impact on the smuggling of Chinese as a result of the 1996 immigration reform law."
4,The loop of perception,"A common theme emerges from this video recorded lecture of having three noted thinkers from distinctly different backgrounds ask questions about the world and its seeming lack of order: is there a higher order in the seeming chaos we see. Such a cross-discipline approach to asking questions has been popular since the rising interest in non-linear systems that one would call chaotic (chaos theory). While the lecture tends to ramble in places, it provides an interesting starting point regarding higher systems of order which are beyond the reach of common perception and may be acessible only through mathematics and such."
5,Will Change your perspective,"This book is well written and will challenge your views on the subject of pornography. It will do this regardless of what your current views are be they liberal, conservative, or otherwise."
1,low quality stylus.,"I bought two of these items. After using the first for a week, each time, I wanted to pull the stylus from the jasjar, the whole pen remained blocked in the jasjar while the black cap pulled away from the pen. Few day later the head of the stylus broke when it fell on the floor. On the first day of usage of the second stylus, its head also broke. Very poor quality indeed."
2,Good reference; poor introduction,"Don't waste your money on this tome if you're a beginner like myself. However, if you are a professional, this would be a great reference to have on your desk. A more detailed book on telephone switches probably doesn't exist.For beginners, the author really provided way too much detail. His writing style is very bland. In order to understand the dense material, you have to follow the words very carefully, and then you probably would doze off. Like the other reviewer, I find the density of material counterproductive and impenetrable."
2,Digital ATM by Discovery Toys - Review,"My son received this as a birthday gift. The screen didn't work on the top line, the bill feeder wouldn't take bills at all. I hope this is just a case of a 'lemon'. Discovery Kids is sending a new one out today. You have to have the card inserted to perform any of the functions, FYI. At first, I was trying to get the machine to perform actions, but this didn't work, that's when I discovered you had to have the card inserted at all times. If the new one functions, it should be a nice savings device/fun toy (the latter being most important)."
2,A disappointment,"The copy on the product is a little misleading. It doesn't actually ""dispense"" money like an ATM. When you decide to withdraw you enter the amount you want to take out, the whole bottom drawer opens and you reach in and take out what you want. All the money just sits in the bottom drawer all mashed up together. It would be a good place to hide other small treasures from brothers and sisters.The machine is basically just a big calculator with a running total. If you make an error you have to adjust manually which is confusing to kids.For anyone laboring under the misconception - this machine does not read bills or count money, it's just a calculator with a drawer in the bottom."
2,Great concept...but not durable at all!,"I purchased this toy ATM machine for my 10 year old son. He loves saving money & is a very responsible young man, so I knew this would be the perfect toy/gift for him. Unfortunately it broke within minutes of setting it up. We were both very disappointed!"
4,ATM machine,"My son enjoys putting his coins in the machine and watching his money grow. I also think this is helpful in learning the value of the coins he is putting in. The only let down is I thought it would speak as money was entered similar the demo button however, it just beeps. My son still really likes the machine and he enjoys saving his money with it."
4,Play ATM Machine,"My 9 year old daughter wanted this ATM machine for a while,and was really excited when it came. My 14 year old son set it up for her, so I'm assuming the set up isn't too difficult.It comes with an ATM card and you have to choose a PIN for it.My daughter makes deposits and withdrawls and really enjoys it.It's fallen several times already off the couch and it still works perfect so I'd say it's pretty durable."
4,review of classic cowboy stories,"I bought this book as a gift for my husband's birthday, he enjoyed it very much. I was impressed by the way it was wrapped for shipping and the promptness I received it. Thanks Amy Jones"
4,Good biography for the most part,"This is probably one of the better biographies in the American Presidents series, being fairly balanced and engaging overall. The only major flaw is the author's own inability to rise about his partisanship towards G.W. Bush and the Republicans all the while criticizing Polk for being unable to rise about his partisanship against the Whigs."
2,Way too brief!,Mr. Siegenthaler was a fine newspaper editor and a pivotal character in Nashville history (although I think he would dispute that.) He also has a reader-friendly writing style but unfortunately 180 pages is not sufficient to encapsulate an American President's life. The book was long on substance but short on content.
3,A Partisan Defender of a Forgotten President,"The reasons I rated the work as only average are:1. I distrusted the scholarhip.2. The biographer forfeited objectivity with the way he argued that that Polk is underappreciated.3. Polk never came to life for me.4. The tone can be overly casual, like a human interest story in a newspaper.4. It does not compare well with other biographies in The American Presidents series, such as the Jackson or Van Buren works."
4,"Interesting profile of one of your lesser known ""great"" presidents","James Polk is often listed with the ""near great"" category of U.S. Presidents. It is ironic that so little has been written about him given that he probably did more in four years as President than any other man who has held the office. This is a decent examination of his time in office and offers a solid background of the interesting characters he came across. I think it is safe to say he was the last Jacksonian era president and was surrounded by those who would play key roles in the run up to the Civil War.All in all not a bad book. Not great, but given the lack of materials on James Polk, I doubt there is much better out there."
4,Surprising President,"James Polk was more successful than anyone would expect, given that so little is known about him. this book covers the highlights. It's well written and a quick read. Not all the detail some would like, but a good overview and entertaining too."
2,Not informative or what I expected,I thought this would define what is right and not wrong in a better manner. Very brief and uninformative.
2,Martial Soup,"If you liked Joe Hyams' ""Zen in the Martial Arts"" or Herman Kauz's ""The Martial Spirit"", then you're supposed to like ""On the Warrior's Path"". But you probably won't. What Hyams and Kauz do well -- i.e., convey something important about the martial arts beyond their self-defense or health considerations -- Mr. Bolleli does only in mediocre fashion. Certain chapters were well done, such as his categorization of martial arts systems. And Mr. Bolleli is an interested observer of and commentator on Ultimate Fighting. But most of the book seemed a mish-mash of essays on disparate subjects, with no central argument and few engaging insights. Travel on this warrior's path at your own risk."
5,True punkrock,"I saw these guys live in 1997 after being a huge fan and they were awesome. Kirsten Patches is an amazing performer and their songs are interesting and well-written. Granted, I completely disagree with many of the lyrics and ideas they are spouting, but they are incredibly talented and deserve much more recognition than they have received. They are one of the true modern punk bands, in keeping with such great acts like Vice Squad and X."
5,love it when it WAS availabe,I can not find this oringal product any where else not this one.... the new one my wife saids it tooooooo sticky and makes her hair lumply.... Not sure why they change the formula and now we buy a different BRAND all together HAHA take that DOVE!!!!!
1,What is this woman on?,"So I watched this for laughs and my god...what is this woman on?! Her pupils are so dilated! And why is the guy that's interviewing her like filmed separately from her???How much did she get paid to do this? Can I get money to make a mockumentary please.Anyways, this is to watch if you seriously need a good laugh. Thirty six minutes and I think 30 minutes is dedicated to her rambling on and on about crap that any actor/actress could tell you! Too much ordinary rambling. Seriously, if you have read a copious amount of Monroe biographies, then you too can be a ""medium"" and ""channel"" Marilyn Monroe, create your own documentary and rip off poor Monroe off. Marilyn is probably roooolllling in her grave."
2,not at all what I expected.,This did not appear to be real at all and some what holey. Very silly really as this woman says to be channeling Marlyn Monroe?? Very questionable. Don't waist the money.
2,ok!!!,"This movie is just ok!! It's really hard for me to believe this woman really is channeling Marilyn.. The first 10 mins of this video she repeats her self over and over and over.. I don't even feel as if this woman did a good job at portraying Marilyn.. She was tring to make the same facial expressions as Marilyn, she didn't do a very good job. It's so sad that people are still bring to make money off of Marilyn's death.."
4,"Very Interesting, but short--","When this program first began, the medium was a little shakey--you got the impression there was going to be some bad acting. But a spirit or personality gradually began to seep through and set upon this person. As the spirit/entity became more comfortable with its medium body, it was very clear and delivered an entralling message.What really solidified this for me was toward the end, a questioner asked how she felt about Joe De Maggio. That spirit came through so clear--the woman looked as if she had been stuck right to the core and had this long, distant look exactly like Marilyn had in her eyes in that photo the day her divorce was final from Joe. Her eyes welled up and she was very struck. It was extremely eerie.I believe this was authentic and it was interesting. I liked it very much but I wish there were more intro about the medium and what they were setting out to accomplish in their spirit visitation."
2,Marilyn - is that you?,"I'm an AVID MM fan and I was embarassed. As a piece of comedy, the best I can say is it's pooly done. I'm not saying the lady wasn't sincere in her efforts. I didn't learn a single thing I haven't heard repeated over and over for years, along with some standard ""from beyond"" phrases/statements. It just didn't register on my scale......"
2,Great movie but not as advertised.,"This is not in widescreen, but full frame from what looks like a washed out VHS transfer."
5,Go peddle it else where the good's look damaged !,"I love this film , I have it on VHS . I just refuse to pay for what theyre asking for on DVD , please ""Cleopatra and Gone with the wind "" didnt ask for that price . Ill wait until I see $19.95 ."
4,Childhood favorite,"This movie was an old childhood favorite. Rewatching it, it is not as good as I remember, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it. Mandy Patinkin and Glenn Close are both solid comedic actors. They more than make up for the fact that script leaves a lot to be desired. This isn't ""Citizen Kane"" quality, but if you are looking for something light for a Friday night, I'd highly recommend it."
2,Disappointed by Production of Tape,"Great movie,excellent acting and story/line but this product unlike most VHS pre-records is done in EP mode rather than the top quality SP mode (and niether the seller or the price tag would suggest that your'e purchasing anything but the best replication available) and the tracking static is impossible to control,it's either present at the top of the screen or the bottom.Purchasers should be forwarned of this especially if it's their intent to make a VHS to DVD conversion. In fairness to the product,if you can live with the static (from the Tracking)you'll probably find it to be minute enough to look beyond, especially since Maxie (G.Close's)role is that of a Flapper from the Twenties when static was commonplace........"
1,Ruined a great book!,"This film is ... They took a really great story by Jack Finney (author of Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and ruined it. It was originally called, ""Marion's Wall"" and it was just incredible. Seek out ""3 By Finney"" in the book section if this interests you and don't spoil your memory of it with this tripe."
4,A good resource for supporting Microsoft products,"TechNet has been invaluable a few times in supporting Microsoft products (who else but Microsoft knows more about their own bugs!) The information in the CDs (updated monthly) is more complete and extensive than what you can find on Microsoft's Knowledgebase (online support). This is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing when I can find a solution on it that I could not find in the Knowledgebase or anywhere else. It is a curse when I search for a solution and have to browse through hundreds of hits. What I usually do in troubleshooting is search the Knowledgebase first. If I don't find a solution there, then I search TechNet. TechNet has saved me hours of work more than a few times - enough to make TechNet worth the price."
1,It Doesn't Get Much Worse...,".... than this movie for acting, dialogue, costumes, props and especially casting. It just doesn't..."
1,"Black Vikings, what a joke!!!","Black Vikings, yeah right why do hollywood morons always make European heritage a grey mono-culture and distort history (reality) to be over the top PC and infest multi-culture into everything. I had to give one star to post my reply."
2,wasn't the worst movie ever made,"This movie had it's funny moments. Nothing that you'll think back on and think ""God that was so funny!"" but it was worth a rental. Most of the jokes will get a chuckle out of you. The rest will get dead silence.I don't get why they'd want to parody Borat when Borat IS a parody. That made no sense. They didn't even change his character any to make fun of him. They basically just got an impersonator and copied the character directly from the TV show and movie.And the Wolverine giving the finger with his claw? That was done in X-Men 1. What was supposed to be funny about that?"
1,"please, stop, please!!","Will HOllywood please stop spitting out these terrible excuses for spoof films? There are actually goods ones, like Austin Powers and Airplane! but this movie has just taken way too far.I don't know what i was thinking sitting there watching the whole thing, but I guess this sort of movie doesn't require much thought."
1,Epic Failure,"I love parodies and am a big fan of Airplane!, Spaceballs, etc but this was just horrible writing, directing...all of it...just bad. The cover on the case indicates that this was written by two of the six writers for Scary Movie (which also wasn't that good but had a few laughable moments here and there). If so, they must have been the two worst writers for Scary Movie. They'll really have to work hard to redeem themselves after this one."
2,Junk food for the brain,"I don't normally watch these type of movies, but my curiosity got the best of me and I popped this into the DVD player this evening. The movie would not be at all funny unless you've seen Nacho Libre, Narnia, Snakes on a Plane, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, X-Men, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The DaVinci Code, among others. Fortunately I have seen most of these movies so the parodies were not lost on me.The sets and acting was mediocre, and the movie progressed quickly from one parody to another, and I actually did find myself laughing through a lot of the movie, but once it was over I kind of felt like I had just ingested junk food for the brain.What did my husband think? He headed off to bed half way through, and he actually tends to enjoy comedies. Young people, especially those who enjoy comedies and have seen the above movies will probably find this movie to be moderately funny. I'm just glad I didn't waste my money at the theater on this one."
2,"Just save your money, nothing new here","This has got to be one of the worst spoof movies I have ever seen, and that is amongst some big bad ones, like the last 2 scary movies, and date movie. they need to kill this series. they have a huge cult following, and I admit, I was a follower. But no more. This was just awful. 4 orphans are given a chance to tour a chocholate factory, where the evil owner tries to imprison them. Low and behold, they escape into a wardrobe where they can become heros. However, they do this through a lot of childish jokes, and just sensless nudity (in the unrated version). either version you rent, theatrical or unrated, just plain pointless. there just wasn't much to laugh at. Save your money, leave this on the shelf."
1,The biggest turkey this side of Thanksgiving,"This is the worst film I've ever seen. If this was the only film available on a transatlantic flight, I'd still recommend looking out of the window."
1,Big fan of Spoofs,"I'm a big fan of spoofs. Also, I rarely post reviews on Amazon. But the world needs to know that this is an Epic Fail!"
1,WHY???,"This film has no right to exist. How is it possible that the makers of this film are still getting jobs? There is no comedy in this film: it does nothing but references and disgusting, vulgar bodily function humor, with lots of defecating, peeing, and vomiting throughout. This is everything that is wrong with hollywood; it's disgusting, it's unfunny, it genuinely hurts to watch, and yet more and more movies like this are being made! My god people, is this really the kind of stuff you want to see in the theaters? If so, WHY?"
1,the most Horrible movie made!,"This movie is SO bad! It so not funny,and very stupid. This movie is SO lame. Do not waste your money on this movie! I watched half, and could not watch anymore! Overall, this movie is awfull! If I could I would rate this zero stars!"
2,2.5 Stars,"""Epic Movie"" was lame, corny, and bizarre, yet entertaining and somewhat funny. I saw this movie once and that's enough for me."
1,No Way,"This was without a doubt the worst movie ever made. If they could of only made it better, meaning like REALLY BETTER, maybe I would consider it. Other than that, TERRIBLE!!!!"
3,Not that bad,I can't believe how picky people have become. I saw this movie and would never say it was as good as Scary Movie but it did have some parts where I was laughing pretty hard. They maybe could have tried a little harder in some parts but all in all not too bad considering the movies that came before this one are hard to beat.
1,Ugh....Just don't get this movie,"I went to see this movie with high hopes. I was aware that it wasn't going to be the most intelligent movie ever, but the commercials were really funny and I was interested.This movie isn't as funny as the commercials would want you to think. The stuff that was funny in previews were only funny because they were taken out of context. When it actually got to those parts in the movie, it barely earned a chuckle. Instead of having funny parts, a lot of the time it just went with gross humor. The worst part of the movie for me was the ""Pirates Music Video."" The entire time it was going I was waiting for it to end.The worse part is that this movie has a lot of big names and people with lots of potential. Jayma Mays did a great job, but you can't act a good move out of crap writing and directing. Same with Kal Penn, David Carradine, and Darrell Hammond.In conclusion, SAVE YOUR MONEY. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE."
2,Ummm...,"Well, it was no ""Scary Movie"" or ""Airport!"", but, the spoofs were funny. It was funny when they were training at Hogwarts and Peter kept on killing people like Hagrid and Dumbledore.Besides that, i admit, the movie sucks."
1,Very Dissapointed,"I am very disapointed in this product, it came in about two weeks and in terrble condition, it was a new, never opened but the where cracks in the cover the disk was all scratched up and the case was falling apart and had holes everywhere terrible service.Don't forget also that this movie is vulgar rude,boring and has Terrible acting I can see why it is a 2 star out of 10 on IMDB. DON""T ORDER THIS PRODUCT."
2,Horrible,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a total waste of time. 80 Minutes of total irritation.
3,could have been more,"Personally, I would rate this movie 2.5 stars, but since Amazon doesn't allow that, I guess I'll be generous and give it 3. This movie started out well enough, and there were other funny parts through the movie (like Aslo - parodied from Aslan - having two actors that look very different), but there were some crude/unfunny and unneeded bits in this movie, and there were too many of then, which costs this movie at least a star. I generally enjoy these genre parody movies, but the abundance of pop-culture references of meaningless celebrities make this a piece that will become dated quickly."
1,You will need a Suicide prevention hotline number,"Awful, I saw this movie once when I was really bored and came close to suicide watching it. It is just awful and blows chunks. Don't watch it, unless you are a fan of bad movies, or your good at making jokes at films and can do the Mystery Science thing/Bevus and Butthead to amuse yourself. This movie was overdone, and not funny. By the real D. Miller"
1,"Terrible Movie, Very Few Laughs","Following in the traditions of the 'Scary Movie' series, this movie is awful. Their really is no story line. The purpose of the movie is to try to make fun of other movies but the problem is the jokes are horribly unfunny. The only amusing part of this movie to me is the Captain Jack Sparrow scenes and only because they imitate him well. There was way too much 'Lion, Witch & The Wardrobe' spoofing. Whoever wrote this should be fired."
1,I hate knowing this movie is in my collection,"This has to be one of the worst movies i've been. The comedy isn't funny, the acting sucked, the storyline was beyond stupid. I've seen a lot of make fun movies but this one was a complete FAIL on all levels. As soon as I leave work today, I'm going to shred this dvd!"
1,STOP NOW!,"Ok, first there was Scary Movie, which was great, then there was Scary Movie 2, which was great. Then we were welcomed with a plate full of bs with Scary Movie 3 and 4. Then it only got worse, I tolerated Date Movie. Then I'm like how much worse could Epic Movie be? IT SUCKED! Very rarely do I say a movie sucked, but this one sucked big time! There is nothing comedic about it. This is just a poor attempt from washed up writers trying to pick up the pieces of a mediorce career that has turned to pure and utter BS. The times humor is attempted it is not amusing. I can not talk of one humorous part that wasn't already pre determined or has already been used. The jokes are old, the lines are lame, and the acting sucked. I waisted my money."
4,epic movie,"My Oppinion: Epic Movie was funny they could've done without the nacho lebrie skit but oh well. i thought it was stupid and hilarious, that's what it was meant to be.About the film: Epic Movie is a spoof film of The Chronicals Of Narnia, Charlie & The Chocolate Factor & a little bit of everything else. It's mainly about four orphanes who win a ticket to willy wonka's factory and discover narnia and fight the evil white [...](The bad Guy), and in all of this they run into the most odd opsticales.if you liked this movie then check out the soundtrack"
2,epic movie unratted,This movie was very disappointing not very funny. Just has its moments is all not enough reference to all the other movies its making fun of.
1,If only i could have NO Stars,"that is right NO stars. it WAY WAY too over the top. Spoofing movies is just not funny any more. Look Carmen Electra is in this. Name one good movie that she has been in. Wait, Good Burger was good, nevermind. I dont know what else to say. Extremly bad"
3,alright,"I went on a date with my girlfriend to go see it and we enjoyed the movie together a lot. Overall the movie had funny moments but not enough for a good comedy due to all the sexual humor. I noticed while in the theater many people were talking instead of waatching the movie(including me). I enjoyed watching it but at times i just got sick of all the sexual humor! What is with all of the nasty comments in the movie script? Basically, only watch this movie if you want to see it with an urge. Overall it's a 2.5/5 but really 3 stars. By the way (even though no one cares) it all went great with my girlfriend!"
2,Where's my ice pack? I have a headache,"Spoof movies will either sink or swim with audiences. There is a fine line between stupid and good comedic genius. This movie, however, fell into the first catagory. Then again, I knew that when I got it for the evening, so I wasn't completely disappointed.Combining a cast from other spoof / comedy movies and a WHOLE lot of other recent blockbuster hits (Chronicals of Narnia, Willy Wonka, X Men, etc.), four orphans are brought together to have an adventure in Narnia combining all the aspects of before named movies. It is too busy, has too many ridiculous premises, and just plain bad.Some good words for this movie? Crispin Glover as Willy Wonka. He was actually a better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp was, even though he was only in the movie for five minutes. Otherwise, skip this one."
1,Unspeakable,"My thirteen year old son begged me to take him to see this film. Afterward we both agreed never to speak of the experience to anyone. A little dramatic, perhaps, but after considering the time and money spent to sit through one and a half exercible hours, we both agreed it was time and money best forgotten. DO NOT BOTHER. Trust me."
1,Yea This Movie Was Terrible,"I'm a very big fan of movie spoofs, but I'm sorry this movie was sickeningly awful. The only good parts was the X-Men spoof and the Pirates of the Carribean spoofs. The rest of this movie was just ""uggh"". You know you got a terrible movie when it's just been released and the rental store shelves are packed with returns within a week. I bought this moive for $2.50 and I want my money back.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!"
1,Got to be the worst movie ever...,"I have seen some terrible movies in my lifetime... but this one has to be the worst. If you've ever seen ""Skinned Deep"" you'd agree that even that movie made more sense than this one. Why did I see this piece of garbage? I did it as a favor to my father, who wanted to watch it instead of Night at the Museum. I only gave ONE obligatory laugh when the Captain Jack Swallows character stabbed another character, but other than that, I did not laugh at all. I actually wish that I could have stabbed myself during this movie because at least then I would have had a reason to leave my father there in the theater. Even my father was embarrassed that he wanted to see this movie after it was over. I'm sure that this marks the end of a career for most of these young actors and definitely delivers a blow to the suffering careers of the other more established actors. As far as the acting extras, I suggest that you omit this movie from your resume, because it will only hurt you."
1,"It will be hard to have a worse movie made this year, Just an honest waste of time and film.","Bad, plain and simple. The jokes are not funny, the story it just Stupid, and the movie spoofs are just rediculously tied together. And I can't believe how Kal Penn ever decided to get involved with this movie, a final bullet in his career, absolute suicide. I thought his movie Van Wilder 2, the rise of Taj was bad enough, but he outdid himself. The two main movie spoofs are of Charlie and the Chocolate factory, then Tied into the Chronicles of Nardia, with tid bits of other movies thrown in, such as pirates of the Carribean. Overall, just not funny. I guess if I had to think of one reason to see this movie, it would be to make every other bad movie out their seem great, The same theory as Picking ugly person so you look so much better standing next to them. Just save the money, I can't even believe that a major studio would bankroll this one."
1,Epic Movie (Unrated Edition),"Epic Movie (Unrated Edition)At first I had visions that this less than ""Epic"" was on the heels of let us say Mel Brooks, ""Space Balls or Blazing Saddles."" For its parady, but upon closer examination that film is crude and double untundras and obvious erotic inclinations, make it seem more like a low budget film made in someone dormitory using the theatrical department of an under budget production company. If there is any justice the writers and directors will not be allowed to make any more films, (or be allowed to run with sharp objects)."
1,As bad as you might expect,"Nobody goes into a movie like this thinking they will see great art, but I was hoping for at least a modicum of cleverness and originality. I didn't find it here. This movie just isn't very funny, not even in a stupid, toilet humor kind of way. I also thought it a bit weird that the main film parodied was ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" a film I'm sure many little kids saw. There is no way an 8 year old should see this movie. There is way too much sexual innuendo for that. I'm sure some of the target audience for this movie saw ""Narnia,"" but I think it would have made more sense to parody the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, since they are geared for an older audience. I can think of a lot of stupid movies that are genuinely funny, but this isn't one of them."
3,Water Down...,"Problem with these type of movies today are, that people had already seen too many of them, as it gets to the stage of being ""Tired of"". When Scary Movie came out for the first time, it was actually good, I had some good laughs and enjoyed the movie. When time goes by, more and more of these kind of movies came to the box office, by the time it reaches Scary Movie 3, It was no longer funny anymore. Epic Movie is relatively the same thing with repeated humour, and many of what I like to refer to as ""FORCE LAUGHTER"", where as it's not even funny but you force yourself to laugh anyway because you know it's supposed to be funny. Some scenes caught me, most scenes just put me to sleep. In conclusion, this ""Water Down"" movie is not a MUST watch, but you should see it for yourself, perhaps your taste may be different than that of mine."
1,Where is the zero star option?,"I have seen my share of BAD movies. This one takes the cake, however.Long story short, this is the worst movie I have EVER seen. I thought Date Movie was bad, but this is far worse. We need to stop encouraging Hollywood to make movies like this.The plot is horrible at best. Then again, that is you expect from a movie who's sole purpose it to parody other movies."
2,"Couple hits, a lot of misses","Yea, this movie isn't great. It could have been funny, but it's just kind of lacking. The parts of the movies they decide to make fun of, just seem kind of uninspired. For example, they make fun of the Harry Potter gang's age. Huh? He's maybe 2 years older he's supposed to be... why not the fact that an elderly man looks over a house full of young children? Or the length of his wand? Or soooomething. But sticking a bunch of old actors in the spots...puhlease.Captain Jack isn't bad. Well, it's at least a fairly good copy of the real character, but they didn't really do anything from the movie. He could have had some funny parts..."
1,Huh?,"I only rated this to get the overall rating down. So you people who work hard, could spend your money on quality items."
1,DUMB and STUPID,Ughh what a waste i saw this in the thethers and it sucked. Dont get this!!! Would rate 0 stars if i COULD!
1,"please stop, please",These movies are soooooo aweful idk why theatures still approve to show them.I saw two minutes and turned it off.
1,I hate parody movies.,"They are not funny. If you cant make a good funny movie without making fun of something else than give it up. I remember back when Scary movie was out, I myself thought it was the dumbest movie ever made and everyone else around me thought I was an idiot. Then not only was that bad enough they had to make 3 more. and then date movie comes along and now epic movie. I mean, who is the target audience for this movie? Who thinks this is funny? Its not anything new, Its not original its a rip off of somewhat decent movies. I am posting this review to get that point across. This is not directed to Epic Movie necessarily because I havent even seen it. Although, I already know it will be stupid."
4,A good way to open the door,"Although the sentiment in this book is simple, I have found it to be a good catalyst for discussion about adoption. The details don't match in all repects to our adoption, but we are able to supplement our own changes."
5,Pretty Good,"I have two adopted children, they enjoyed this story.... although, it does not match our adoption story, to us, its still a story!"
1,Very materialistic book. Not really adoption oriented.,"This book talks about what kind of pajamas were bought, room decorations, carseats, mobiles, quilts, diapers, pacifiers, flowers, wind chimes... all materialistic items. It's supposed to be about preparing for bringing home the baby, but could be for any child being born. Only the last two pages had anything about love or acceptance, and very little at that.Strangely enough, the book has an odor that makes me sneeze. It must be something about the way it was printed.I don't care for the crayon illustrations... they aren't childlike, and they aren't artistic, so the book is just weird looking.To me, there is absolutely no benefit to reading this book. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Didn't care for it,I checked this out at our local library before buying. I will not be purchasing it. I just don't care for the tone of the book. It falls flat as it is very basic and about the parents preparations for the child. It does not have any emotional depth to it. I am looking for books to introduce adoption to our 2 1/2 year old. I prefer 'Tummy Mummy' and 'How I was Adopted' to this one. I also like 'Tell me a Real Adoption Story' for when she is older.
4,Basically good,"Where are the birthparents in this book? Did the child hatch from an egg?The illustrations are beautiful and the text is good, but I'm still waiting for the children's book that acknowledges birthparents, especially since closed adoptions are becoming a thing of the past."
2,"Okay, but one-dimensional","This book is an okay book for those just beginning to talk with their kids about their adoption stories. In simple language it tells about the day they met. In my experience as an adoption professional, though, most adoption stories--at least domestic--include some contact with the birth mom and/or dad and perhaps their families. This book would be richer if it were revised to include that contact."
2,The Day we Met You,"This book is a lot more specific to a very unprepared family than I would have hoped. I think most adoptive parents have something before they get on the list- a carseat, crib or bassinet- something..."
1,I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE ACTUALLY CHARGES $$ FOR THIS BOOK,"I RECEIVED THIS BOOK, READ IT IN 30 SECONDS, THEN DECIDED TO RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY! THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN, IF YOU COULD CALL IT THAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE ACTUALLY PUBLISHED THIS. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME! DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WORN YOU!!"
2,Not great,"We received this as a gift when we first started the process to adopt our son and I have to say I do not like this book very much. The illustrations look amaturish and also I agree with other reviewers about being put off byhow unprepared the couple seems. I don't think anyone giving birth is borrowing a carseat on their way to the hospital. Also (and this is just as an FYI) it's not for people who are adopting internationally (which we did). It's also weird to me that it's written in ""you"" form. So anypart of the story that doesn't match yours makes it a weird read."
5,great story for kids,"i bought this book used...it came in almost new condition...my husbands mother read this book to him 70 yrs ago, he told me about it...i was surprised to find it on amazon...i'm reading this book to my grand kids. they love it.."
5,Old childhood memory rediscovered!,"A favorite story as a child, and now found it shopping on line. Had to order it. It's as remembered, and now my grand children can enjoy the story too."
5,This book is a classic!,"This was my favourite book as a child. I'm a 31 year old man now and still have this book. I specialized in English at the University of Toronto so saying that this is my favourite book is kind of a big deal. I like how Pablo never gave up on his pursuit to find a warm climate to live in. When you grow up in Canada with some harsh winters, you know that Pablo had the right idea. He persevered and was rewarded with a nice tropical beach. I think this book contains a great message for children. Pursue your dreams and never give up! I`m hoping to have kids within the next five years and if I do, I`ll be reading this book to the little ones. If not, I`ll read it to myself every once in a while when I`m feeling a little down."
4,Quick delivery,"The delivery of the book far exceeded my expectations as I didnt expect to receive the book till well after Christmas, the book was in very good condition except for one pen mark/scribble on the back, other than this very happy as this book means a lot to my wife."
5,As good as their live shows!!,"Shangoya fans will love how the band's energy and soul makes it to ""vinyl"" in this ""take me back to those good old days"" collection of their finest. Minnesota fans will tear up with memories, and new listeners will become dedicated fans. PLAY ON!"
1,Bogus,Written from the point of view of someone with a forgone conclusion. Before you spend a penny on it check out the analysis of it at [...] or search for David Fasold Ark bogus on your favorite search engine.
1,junk,I was disappointed with this purchase. This must have been pressed in somebody's basement. The picture and sound quality are terrible. P.O.W. the escape was the real title of this movie. I don't know how a reputable firm like Amazon can sell this garbage.
2,"[Two and a half out of Four stars] Another attempt at Col. James Bo Gritz, p.o.w.'s rescue, this time with D.Carradine as Col.","Except that Carradine plays Col. JimCooper and nutty Golan Globur crewstages this one. Not as bad as RamboIII or Missing In Action III, as SlyStallone, who opposed Carradine insilly Death Race 2000 (*), or ChuckNorris went to the well once too of-ten in those pics. Carradine and re-cognizable black American actor Steve(Johnny B. Goode) James steal the showbut despicable Mako, a former Hawai'iFive-0 actor is believable enough untilhis hardcore end. Typical pretty goodCarradine actioner undone by sorry Go-lan Globus production standards whichare worse than Roger Corman's Am.Indies!"
2,JBweld base to ceramic or it might separate.,"Bought this to keep my Sulcata tortoises outdoor enclosure warm through winter. Installed it but woke up and saw that the temperature was at 40F! Took a look and saw the that the ceramic bulb was hanging by a wire from the base. I ripped the other wire off and took the base out with some pliers. I found another lightbulb base and soldered one wire through the top and the other on the outside and around the edge of the base making sure that the two wires couldn't touch. Once that was done I used JBweld, a two part epoxy, to glue both pieces together. Other than that it was cheap and works well."
3,Great product but didn't last long...,"This is a great no-illumination heat lamp. Used outdoors, in combination with a thermostat, this heat lamp kept our chickens warm... but not for long. The product survived, protected from abuse, for 3 months with only occasional use.For the price that seems very expensive. Now I will look for an alternative but will likely return to this product again since I like the fact there is no illumination and the lamp keeps the outdoor building quite warm. 250watts continuous is a power sucker but it is what it is.Overall not bad, just wish it would have lasted as long as an incandescent lightbulb."
2,Don't pay too much!,A new copy of this book is available from the Girl Scout organization for 3 dollars. I can't imagine someone paying hundreds of dollars for it!
4,Robert Gamer,"Rabbi Dr. Daniel Sperber is an Israel Prize laureate for his talmudic research. His also the president of the Institute of Advanced Torah Studies at Bar-Ilan University. Certainly not ""high school"" essays."
5,Japanese re-issue,"This is a great CD. I bought it several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, for a lot less money, you can get the Ace release, ""Pet Projects:The Brian Wilson Productions"" that has a few MORE songs on it."
2,Outrageous Oldies - Great Balls of Fire,"I was thoroughly disappointed when I listened to this CD for the first time. None of the songs are recorded by the original aritist. The sounds and voices leave a lot to be desired. Beat is also faster than it should be for most of these songs. I should have looked over the information about the CD more carefully,and I would have seen that the songs were not by the original artists. Therefore, if you remember the likes of the greats like Jerry Lee Lewis, you will be disappointed in this music!!"
4,High Ballin' VHS,"High Ballin' -I have the VHS Non-Amazon version of this : Good Trucker movie with Jerry Reed in Canada, and A Nice Red & White Kenworth K123 Cabover just like on the cover. Good Action. Some good acting, I could do without peter fonda though(Commie). Plot is about trucks being Hijacked by King Carroll(A crooked truck broker) Helen Shaver is pretty."
5,Inspiring Expereince,This is definitely one of those books where you are more and more entertained by each page you turn. Author Michelle Adams does a great trick here by flawlessly setting in perfect life lessons in her true to life ancedotes. I read it in one sitting!
5,Little lessons that have a big impact!,"This book is one that you won't want to put down. Michelle's style of writing makes you feel like you are reading about your best friends experiences. You will be laughing, crying and saying ""yes!"" as you read each days lesson. This is a great book for a new mom, a mom that needs some encouragment or anyone that wants to start seeing God's lessons through the lives of children. It has encouraged me to look at my experiences with my kids in a new light. I am amazed at what God can teach us when we start wanting to learn. Thanks to Michelle for opening my eyes to seeing God in the little things."
4,good review for the oral thoracic boards,I got this book shortly before the oral boards and thought it was a good review. It does not have enough details for the writtens.
2,A disappointment,I've read most of the Hemlock Falls mysteries and have enjoyed them. But this one has a disjointed plot. There are loose ends that go nowhere; serious questions are unanswered; and the mystery is solved only with 2 revelations out of left field at the end. It looks as if the author (and her editors) fell down on this one.It's a good thing that most of the others are much better.
2,Where's the mystery?,"This book, while not entirely offenmsive, could have been cut in half. The end of the novel seems to quickly put together missing pieces in a haphasard way. There is also very little ""detecting"" done...Quill and Meg seem to just bumble along without getting anywhere. In fact, only a clue purposefully sent to Quill helps solve the myster. Perhaps other books in the series are better...."
2,Why so many words?,"Have enjoyed many of Bishops books, this one is not among them.If there is a story to be found here, it could have been said in 10 pages perhaps. It rambles, it never lands on anything that would make one care to finish the book though."
2,Thought This Book Was A Mystery?,I have enjoyed this series until I got to this book. What happened? It would have been better if the editor had Claudia Bishop cut the book down some. Too much going on. I know writers pick certain quirks for their characters but Megs' tantrums is getting a bit old. She is in her 30s but acts like a 2 year old.I have read many mystery series and have noticed one trend. At a certain point the author seems to get tired of doing the series and starts slacking off. It is like they don't care anymore and that is what I sense with this book.
3,Not one of her best,"I am a big fan of Nicole Jordan and this is my least favorite of her novels. I found the passion to be somewhat subdued and she works very hard to craft the relationship between Niall and Sabrina, I feel they never really ""clicked"". Niall's continuing relationship with his mistress is also a break from Jordan's traditional standards and I found it rather unappealing. I would recommend this for die-hard Jordan fans, but not for someone just being introduced to the author."
5,This 2004 edition is even better.. the hero is better,"Niall does *not* commit adultery at all, or even fool around, once he and Sabrina are together, in this newer edition. I like it much better than the 1997 edition. It's really enjoyable.Good read. I like Nicole Jordan's books a lot, and always look forward to them!"
4,"Finally, a good Scottish Romance!","I'd just about given up on books set in Scotland, or staring Scots, but Nicole Jordan gives us a Scottish tale that FEELS Scottish!!! She knows her way around the highlands and a kilt . . . now if only more authors would follow her lead."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!,"I absolutely LOVED this book. It was great from the first page. I loved the way Niall turned Sabrina into the woman that she could be. But, my favorite part was when he caught her with Keith...twice! It was quite fitting for the Darling of Edinburgh to be jealous!"
4,"Overall, a good read.","This was the first book of Nicole Jordan's that I have read. Overall, I felt it was a good read. Very steamy and I loved the battle scene. I loved how Niall (Europes most notorious lover) fell so hard for little Sabrina. Very cute. The only thing I wish the author would have done less is focus on how handsome Niall was and what a great lover he was. O.k. I got the point from the beginning, but I didn't need to be reminded of that every other page. But, that aside, I liked the story and how Sabrina ended up being a stunning woman by the end. She actually was always beautiful, most of her ""ordinary looks"" were all in her head and Niall worked hard to try to convince her just how desirable she really was."
5,Cool,"My last one (also Flambeau) was good for 5 years of constant outside exposure before breaking. Hopefully this one will last as long. It may or may not keep the herons away from my koi, but it sure looks cool by the pond!"
1,Blue Heron Decoy,"I received the ""Flambeau Great Blue Heron"" decoy on Friday. I love the look of it, but I think the real heron does as well, there were Heron tracks right up to it. Am I doing something wrong? should I be tying streamers on the decoy's neck or tail. Moved it. Any other suggestions. The pond is 1/4 acre."
2,"Scanned copies, below par","This is not a criticism of the novel or the author. The Forsythe Saga is a well known work of literature.This book publication is a digitally scanned copy so as to keep the cost as low as possible. There are many typos and at times it's hard to make sense of many sentences. I do caution buyers before buying any digitally scanned novels.There is a frontispiece disclaimer by the publisher General Books on the typo problems likely to be encountered in their digitally scanned novels, however this is not much help after buying the book online overseas. Amazon should advise customers if their purchase is a scanned copy."
5,"Quite Simply, The Best Movie I have Ever Seen","A beautiful film, a must-see for film enthusiasts... I remember renting this movie in the 80's and being so awestruck by it. I have always kept it in mind, but it has only recently been released on DVD. It stands the test of time. It is full of the exquisite details that draw you in like a passionate lover against whom you have no control. The acting is top-notch, from the beloved Nonna to little Eddie Luca, who tells the story. It is a story of an Italian couple who marry against everyone's wishes, for love. It makes you laugh and cry, and you feel as though you know these characters. Family. Love. Despair. Hope. Luck. It is all there, and you will not be disappointed. A lot of ground is covered here, in just under two hours. There is a good bit of Italian spoken, but the acting is so lovely, that you don't need to know a word, to understand perfectly all that is happening. Please see it."
1,Rip off Report,"do not get this it is junk and the screen is unreadable. The audio is terrible, its a waste of money."
1,"Bad spray bottles, do not buy!","4 out of 4 of the Clean Cage spray bottles failed on the first try!The manufacturers of Clean Cage must have saved a few pennies on production of the spray bottle mechanism. As soon as you squeeze the trigger all the way in, it stays in. Then it does not spray any more.I went to the hardware store and bought a generic plant misting bottle. The Clean Cage fluid sprays perfectly from the hardware store bottle.Do Not Buy This Product!I bought some Healthy Habitat, which is a similar product but in a higher quality bottle that sprays well. Plus I can buy gallon refills of Healthy Habitat. So screw you, Clean Cage!"
1,Smells bad,"I have been searching for a solution that I can use with small pets but this isn't it. It has a very strong, sweet smell, sort of like a room deodorizer. I had to turn on the fan to get the strong smell to dissipate."
2,this cleaner is okay at best.,"it smells nice, but I have to use sooooo much to get my cages clean. there are so many better cage cleaners out there that work so much better and are less expensive, with so many cages to clean I used to go through 4 a month of these. with other cage cleaners I can get a month or 2 out of ONE bottle. Even ones that have half the amount then this one."
4,Fatal Flaw,"I wanted to learn Hebrew, so I got myself this book--the only Hebrew dictionary I could find. Although it got me off to a good start, the dictionary has a fatal flaw that I didn't find out about until later in my Hebrew studies: the author doesn't include vowels! This made me dependent on the phonetic English, when I wanted to start working on reading Hebrew. Other than that, though, it was fine."
2,Hebrew/English dictionary,"Not much of a dictionary. More like a grammar book which I really do not need. Did not intend to learn Hebrew with it, just get by during a visit to Israel. Translation of simple words such as 'cousin' or 'dear' or 'lonely' do not appear.With Google's help occasionally, it will have to do.AA"
2,Pat,Wow! what an overpowering rubber smell. I washed it twice but am still having a hard time using it. It seems a little slippery even on my second use. Not sure if I will keep it. Will give it another try. Any suggestions for getting rid of the odor?
4,think twice about selecting a dark color.,"The mat works well in terms of 'stickiness' and I'm pleased with that. I selected a dark color - which shows dirt easily. It looked like it needed cleaning after the first class. (really after the first 'down dog'...). Personally, I'd select a different color if I could do it over. It came with a slight smell - but that dissipated quickly. Not really a problem. Overall a great mat."
2,Not worth it,i bought this cuz i thought it would help with the slipping but its even worse than me gaiam. I slip as soon as i go into downdog on thsi mat. and its also heavy and hard to roll up. the only up side to this is that its pretty cushiony.
5,"Love this mat, but it does eventually expire","I have had this mat for 3 years and it has been wonderful until just now. Friends had warned me that their Jade Yoga mats had started to disintegrate/break down from the heat in their cars, but I had no such complaints. I have washed it weekly in my washing machine and either hung it to drip dry or sometimes even put it in the dryer, and while I am not sure this was the best thing for my mat, it held up fine. Alas, the end of it's life has finally come. The mat is shedding rubber all over my clothes and starting to develop pits in it and it is time to buy a new one. Would I buy another Jade Mat? Definitely. For me, it has the best cushion and a great stick/non-slip quality. Contrary to other reviews, I don't find it terribly heavy. I don't mind the expense, as long as it serves me well for 3 whole years and puts up with my machine washing!"
3,It's okay...,"This was a gift for my wife. She says it doesn't smell bad the way some new yoga mats do, and it's a nice color. On the other hand it's a little heavy and it's very static clingy."
4,Jade yoga mat,This mat was recommended by my yoga instructor. It has a nice thickness. It seems to be more non-slip than my old mat but I still need to have a towel handy to wipe my palms from time to time. So far so good
5,My First Yoga Mat...,"This is the first Yoga mat that I've purchased. I was using the mats provided at the studio and was having a lot of problems with slipping. I've only had this mat a few weeks so I can't really comment on the wear of it, but so far it's holding up great. Yes, it does smell of rubber, pretty bad, my first couple of times using it my eyes actually watered. I've been keeping it unrolled and outside and now the smell isn't bad. I sweat a lot during practice and so far I haven't slid around on it. The only downfall for me is the mat length. I'm 5'10 so I tend to have to readjust myself on the mat at times. Next time I'll go with the longer mat."
4,Awesome Yoga Mat,"My Jade Yoga mat smelled at first, but after that it was fine. It does not move if you are really into yoga. Maybe power yoga. I would highly recommend you purchase one. I love mine. It has got wet and it was not slippery at all."
2,I was so surprised,"I used my new mat for the 3rd time tonight; it was a hot yoga class and I was very sweaty and the mat did not hold a grip. I'm terribly disappointed, and despite others high ratings, I would not recommend this mat."
2,not sticky after sweat,"I bought this mat in high hopes after sliding constantly on a Manduka Black Mat. At first it seemed I had finally found the perfect mat as everyone claims. In my first class with it, what started out well quickly digressed into the same slipping scenario. For the first time ever I actually had to grab the sides of the mat to keep myself from falling on my face in Downward Facing Dog. I hope it gets better as it soaks up sweat and gets used. I have to say the best mat still is the original thick and narrow black mat that i used to have.will have to look for another one."
5,Very Nice,I first got a cheap Yoga mat but discovered that my feet and hands slipped when sweaty. This mat took care of all that. Very happy with it.
5,Good mat but still can get slippery for me,"My hands can sweat a lot so I still slip sometimes when using this mat. However, it is a huge improvement over my past mat. Not being so preoccupied with my hands slipping has been an improvement for my practice.Definitely use a mat towel to do power yoga on this mat.The mat is expensive, but the fact that it was made in the U.S. makes it worth it."
5,yoga mat,"I have been doing yoga for several years now...and almost from the beginning started a quest for the next better stickier yoga mat. My yoga practice will make me sweat...especially in the summer months. This mat is so sticky, that it sticks to every part that is touching it, not just the hands and feet. No more sliding around in poses such as the downward dog where your hands really need to sink into the mat and you push your whole weight up and back. I almost did not buy it...after trying many other mats I just assumed it would not get any better...well, I am very happy that I did: it is -hands down-the best yoga mat I have ever come across."
5,I LOVE this mat!!!,"I love this mat. Although it does smell like rubber, I'm getting used to it. I never slide anymore on my mat AND it's completely ECO-FRIENDLY!!!"
5,best yoga mat,"The Jade yoga mat is great! It will not slide at all and is very firm and protective of the knees. It is a ""must have"" for anyone who does yoga regularly!"
3,definitely loses traction after a while,"This was the first mat I ever bought about a year ago since my yoga studio stocked them... Like others, I found the traction quite good for a long while, and the cushioning is good. I'd never had any problems with peeling. I practice vigorous vinyasa-style yoga 2-3 times a week, but in the past month, I've had to ditch my mat because it's lost its traction (not just with my hands, but also with the floor -- I can see the corners of the mat spreading out in certain poses). I did try washing it with dishwasher soap and water, but it seemed to make the problem worse rather than helping. I guess on one hand, $50/year for a yoga mat isn't too bad to pay, but I think maybe one of the cheap mats may have been just as sufficient."
1,Buy a different mat... this one isn't worth the $$,"I have had my Jade Yoga mat for a little over a year, using anywhere from 1 - 4 times a week. That's not very often, compared to most yogis.The mat smelled funny from the beginning. It has a strong, rubbery scent. After all this time, the odor is still prevalent and distracting.The worst part is this mat has lost ALL its stickiness / traction. It slips and slides all over the floor, no matter what surface you are on.I actually liked my old, inexpensive Gaiam mat better! But I will be purchasing a Manduka mat based on the recommendation from my yoga instructor."
4,Way too much packaging,"The item I love. Great product, made in the USA from sustainable rubber. The packaging that amazon shipped this with was excessive to the max. I was astonished by the size of the box and volume of paper this item was packaged with. I let amazon know that there was no need to have so much packaging for a rubber mat. You might want to shop around and find a company that uses way less packaging."
3,"Sticky when dry, slipery when wet","After cleaning it wth warm soapy water & letting it air out to dry for about a week, the smell wasn't bad...it beats contact with PVC any day! In the beginning of class, I was impressed how sticky the mat was. However, as I started to sweat ( I don't sweat a lot), the mat got slippery on my hands & feet."
4,Satisfied,"Wonderful mat - enough padding, no chemical smell. I still slip a bit, but I think it's extremely hard to find a mat that will allow NO slipping whatsoever and I do tend to slip more than others."
1,total disappointment,"After reading all the reviews I was so excited to get this product and finally start using a ""real"" yoga mat. I've been practicing for about 4 years now and slipping is my biggest problem. Honestly, my $15 Target mat works better than this one. It feels amazing and very 'grippy' when you first step on to it. But as soon as you generate the slightest bit of moisture you slide uncontrollably. I couldn't even hold myself up in a wheel pose. I plan on writing to the manufacturer and asking for a refund. Per the other yogi's in my class, just spend the extra money and get a manduka."
2,Slippery,"Since I've being practicing yoga three times a week I decided to ""upgrade"" from my cheap Gaia mat from Target to this one. Unfortunately, the first time I used it in class my feet were slipping every time I transitioned to a Warrior One! I'm really disappointed that my cheapo mat works better than this one and wish I could return it."
2,very sticky mat,hard to do laying down poses..salutes ..child's pose- ok for standing where you need the grip- found my hair stuck to the mat.. maybe it will be smoother after worn in..
3,Not slip resistant,"I chose this mat because it is purportedly slip resistant. I have used it multiple times now, and can't tell any improvement in it's slip resistant quality. The thickness of the mat is nice, but I am disappointed that I still slip on it as much as my cheap Gaim mat."
2,A great mat for a few days and then not so great,"The mat is indeed very non-slip when it's clean. But when it's not clean, it's very slick, worse than the worst sticky mat. The problem is that its open cell construction (like a sponge) soaks up sweat and body oils voraciously. The only way to clean it thoroughly is to soak it because the oils and such soak deep into the mat and wiping doesn't clean it. Since it's a big rubber sponge it takes days to dry after soaking it. Even worse than the slipping is that it starts to stink pretty quickly when it's not clean. So it's been quite a chore keeping my mat clean enough to enjoy. I'm tossing this one when it turns six months and going back to a normal sticky mat. I'd rather deal with the slipping using a towel than bother with cleaning this mat anymore."
2,Could not abide the stench,"I bought this mat on my yoga teacher's recommendation but the smell of the rubber was so bad that I returned it. It was laid out in my house for 2 weeks and was still intolerable. And it's not like you can put these in a washing machine; they require tub washing and air drying (but watch out ---no sunlight allowed). This mat is also very dense and hard; the two times I used it I felt like I was lying directly on the floor. On the plus side, it was nicely sticky. I emailed the company asking them to air out these items before selling them but they refuse. There are other eco-friendly mats that do not stink."
5,The BEST mat for HOT yoga!,This amazing mat has a different texture than regular mats. My instructor let me try hers and I was hooked! I love it.
5,Finally,"Finally I got my very own Jade mat. I had two other ones both I slipped on. I did look into Manduka mats but my instructor recommended Jade. I am so incredibly happy with these that I am in awe I managed with the other two pieces of junk! the grip on the Jade mats are truly unbelievable and definitely non-compromising. No doubts, this mat is probably one of the better ones for the price -"
3,Better than Gaiam type mats but still stinks,"The mat is pretty. It is sticky from the get go, although after a month's use comparable to my nearly 6-year-old Manduka ProLite. I have washed it twice now with 30 minute soaks and with a spray mix of white vinegar nearly 20 times. It reeks. I want to love this mat, I do, but in crocodile the fumes are still obnoxious and I have no respiratory or asthmatic issues or allergies. You can smell it even in corpse pose. It's unfortunate because I really wanted to have a second company's mats I could use and recommend, but the odor of tire factory just doesn't want to fade at all."
4,So much better but not quite perfect,"I bought the Jade Harmony 3/16"" mat to replace a cheap mat I have been using for months. My hands sweat a lot when I do yoga and make downward facing dog nearly impossible for me to do without sliding like crazy. I tried the Yogitoes towel on top of my cheap mat and continued to slide so I decided to purchase the Jade mat. It made a huge difference! I still need to use a towel to keep from sliding, but the combination of the towel (slightly dampened) and the Jade mat keep me from sliding 90% of the time. I did try using just the Jade mat (no towel) and continued to slide a little as soon as I started sweating. I had a hard time deciding which mat to upgrade to when I made this purchase, but so far I'm happy with it. I don't know if there is any mat out there that would have completely stopped me from sliding. I'd recommend this mat with a towel to anyone that has the same problem I was having."
5,found the right mat,"Im really happy with my purchase, after trying cheap PVC mats and another TPE mat from a different brand. It took me months to decide which mat to buy again before i finally decided to buy this one from Jade and I never regret my decision. I like the stickiness , thickness and grip. I love my Jade Harmony yoga mat =)"
2,"It stinks, literally and functionally","When you first get this mat, the eau de rubber is overpowering. Eventually, it does subside, but for me it never went away. Perhaps because the mat itself only lasted about three months. Indeed it was quite sticky, for a few practices. After about a month, the traction tapered off and it started to pill and crumble. A few months later, it was at the curb, er, I mean, recycling plant. Go with the Manduka. It's not great either, but WAY better than this."
1,Yoga Mat,This yoga mat was not cheap and I thought I am getting a quality item but unfortunately it make static electricity and collect all trash and hair from the floor at the gym.It had horrible smell and not thick enough.I wish I could return it.
3,LATEX smell very strong.,"I don't know what I was expecting a 'natural rubber' mat to be made of. The fumes very hard to get rid of, I washed the mat multiple times and left it outside for a month. If you can survive the latex fumes the grip and feel of the mat is great, mat seems durable."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS MAT. Slippery mat from the first time I used it, expensive and horrible customer service","I bought a Jade Yoga mat in January. From the first time I used it, literally the first downward dog, I started slipping. I kept thinking I would be able to break it in. After a month, it was still slippery and dangerous to use. I had spoken with a representative from the yoga studio where I bought it and they told me to wash it. As I was talking to the rep, the person standing behind me said they also had that problem from the first time they used it. I washed it but the problem didn't improve. I was then told to contact JadeYoga. After many emails, they were friendly but absolutely unhelpful and I wasn't given a refund.I basically threw $80 down the drain."
1,beware- didn't recveive the right product,I didn't receive the Jade Harmony mat. I received a generic mat that looks like the one I'm trying to replace from a big-box store. Beware if this is not shipping directly from Amazon. If you order this product be sure you get what you paid for!
1,Do not buy this mat,"Do not buy this mat! It is not a Jade yoga mat. It is a generic knock-off. I owned a Jade Yoga mat before I purchased this one, and loved it. I purchased this one in the same color because I lost my other one. It is not the same mat. The Jade yoga mat I had before was a dense, high quality material that was sticky. The mat I received was flimsy, soft, and slick. I started slipping as soon as I got into downward dog on this mat. Also, it was not quite the same shade of green as the authentic Jade Yoga mat that I had before. Honestly, I bought a $10 mat at Target that was better quality than this mat. I would not recommend this mat to anyone."
1,Don't Buy It,"My experience with this mat and the company who makes it was extremely bad. If you don't practice yoga in a dungeon or a dark closet this is not the mat for you. If you ever need to return it or ask for help from the company, this is not the mat for you. ANY sunlight AT ALL renders the mat unusable do to lack of stickiness. Why do YOU buy a sticky mat? I buy mine for the, guess what, STICKINESS!!!!There is supposedly a label when you buy it about this, however, since ANY light will cause the 'sun damage' its really mot. If you call the company and ask for help, the receptionist is likely to be amused by your problem (which she obviously hears a lot) and refer you to the owner whose disinterest is palpable through his e-mail which basically says in polite terms: too bad, so sad.I am strongly considering making a claim through the Better Business Bureau."
3,"Pretty sticky, but crumbles quickly","This mat was very good at first - it's somewhat spongy, so it grips well, even in a sweaty practice. But within 3 months of practice (90 minutes of vinyasa, 4 times a week)the top layer began to crumble. I began finding myself covered with little green bits at the end of practice. I even made sure to clip my nails extra short to be sure I wasn't making things worse. But at one year it's already worn down so that the inner plastic grid is exposed.Also, after washing it with hot water over the last year, it's gotten very stretchy, which makes stepping back and rising up to standing poses very awkward - and forget about jumping forward - I'm just waiting to do a face plant - it just wont grip the floor.I paid 50 bucks for this thing and it only lasted only a third as long as my old $20 PVC mat. I've practiced on a friend's Manduka and Manduka travel mats, and they seem much more durable. Probably a much better choice for the money."
1,Wore out very quickly,"I was reading the other reviews and a lot of them acknowledged that this mat wears out very, very quickly. Yet, still these reviewers gave 4 stars. I can't be that generous. I bought this mat for $60 and it was great. For two months! And then, it started to wear so badly that I would be covered in mat pieces at the end of each practice. I started using it with a mysore rug just to keep from getting gross.My next purchase will be a manduka pro. For $90-$106 most reviews have said they last at least 6 YEARS!!! And it has a lifetime warranty. This is a bargain compared to the jade mat."
5,"Could not be happier, wish I bought it sooner","I have been doing yoga for ten years and have always used the generic mats you buy in stores. After an unfortunate incident where I slammed my car trunk on my mat and out a large whole in it, I decided to research mats and buy a quality mat. I attend 2-3 classes a week, mostly hot yoga. I narrowed my decision down to this or Manduka. Manduka has a closed rubber, so sweat sits on top of the mat. jade is open cell rubber so sweat is absorbed and the mat retains its traction and there's no slipping during a hot class. After class I just wipe down with a yoga mat spray cleaner and it's good for the next class. I can't believe I used a cheap mat for so many years. The change is unbelievable; better grip, better comfort, easier transition between poses."
4,sweating on a rubber mat makes for a slippery surface,"I selected the JADE mat in an effort to be more eco-friendly, but what I did not realize is that if you SWEAT like I do a rubber mat may not be your best bet! :( As a result I have to re-adjust the placement of my palms during poses like Adho Mukha...none-the-less it seems like a strong durable mat!! :)"
5,Love It!!,"I've owned a Jade Professional Harmony mat for almost 3 yrs and it's finally hitting a point were it's not as structurally sound anymore. It has been a very sturdy low slip mat for me and over the past few years it has survived my teacher training, a regular home practice and a regular teaching position. It is completely worth the price for the amount of use that I have gotten out of it. I never noticed a smell, and I cleaned it after every use with a light essential oil solution that I made, unless it was extra soiled then I used soap and rinsed it in the shower. (Not recommended to take to the beach sand likes the mat way too much.)"
4,"Very stinky at first, but a great mat.","I wish someone had told me about the very overwhelming rubber smell of this mat for the first month. I cleaned it with lemon juice, I tried commercial mat cleaners, but the rubber smell was so bad that it made my eyes water during chaturanga. This took four weeks to lessen, and over two months to go away completely. After yoga class my girlfriend commented that I smelled more like rubber than sweat. And yet, I will never part with this mat. It's cushion is perfect, the grip is unlike any other mat I have used before. It's incredibly durable, and doesn't flake off like the cheaper Gaim mats. If you're going to do a lot of yoga and you can suffer through the initial smell, this is probably the best mat on the market."
3,Still not sure,"I'm giving this mat only 3 stars for now. I have had it for about a month and I am hoping that it is better once it is more broken in. I slipped and fell the other day when I was holding a warrior pose because the mat is SO slippery when I sweat. I've always had to use a towel for my hands but with the Jade I had to place towels under my feet so that I could stand on it. The rubber smell is not very offensive to me, I think that is a matter that will be different for everyone but it really doesn't bother me very much. I ordered the blue one and it is more baby blue than the grey blue it appears to be in the picture. Overall the structure of the mat is good quality; I'm just going to keep my hopes up that the mat will be better once it is more worn in."
5,"For teaching & practicing yoga, I choose Jade.","It took me a long time to talk myself into investing a good mat, but I finally became tired of constantly slipping and feeling hard floors through other mats. I am embarrassed to admit I have only cleaned my mat a few times in the last two years, and for that it has lost some grip, but it remains superior to most sticky mats in grip and comfort. I bought this longer version for my husband and have found I prefer a longer mat as well. For teaching and practicing, I will be loyal to Jade mats."
2,Bunching problem with this mat,"For the first 3-4 months this mat was great. There is a distinct ""tire"" aroma but I wasn't bothered by it. After 3-4 months the mat started bunching up off the floor if I was putting pressure in two different directions; ie. it would bunch up around my feet in the warrior series. I had subjected the mat to extreme temperatures in my car from the end of summer to the beginning of winter, I think this is what made it more elastic and less sticky. I was surprised by this because i have many friends who leave their mats in their cars and don't have issues with them. I'm the only one with a Jade mat. I would definitely recommend keeping this mat away from extreme temperatures. I would not purchase another one."
5,The series does get better and better,"This book was lovely with just enough there to make it very enjoyable, but not too overwhelming. It's a good mixture of intrigue and romance without being cloying or sappy. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a love story that is more than just that with a bit of mystery and intrigue and plotting involved. I won't bor you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that. The end was slightly predictable because there were only so many choices in how it could have ended, but for someone like me, the way it ended was just how the characters deserved it to end, whether good or bad, but I would have been a tad more harsh on two of the ""villains"" in this one. Give it a shot, especially if you liked the previous books in the series. I don't think you'll regret it."
5,Concise overview of an important life,"Doris Faber presents a fine overview of one of the most dedicated leaders of the 19th century abolitionist movement, William Lloyd Garrison. Garrison devoted more than 30 years to the cause of freedom for all blacks suffering under the lash of slavery. He often found himself under attack from Southerners, or Northerners sympathetic to the Southern cause. The story of his courage under fire is concisely told by Ms. Faber. Her spare prose makes for a quick, exciting read, and she leaves you wanting to know more about this amazing man. A great introduction to Garrison and the abolitionist cause."
4,The characters jump off the page at you,"Tobin, who is, of course, the author of The Ransom, continues in his idiosyncratic milieu of a town, and perhaps a generation, gone bad. If you are a child of the sixties or seventies, and remember walking the streets of a town full of losers, this tome is both a wake up call, and a welcome home. Highly recommended and, quite possibly, soon to be a major motion picture."
5,Full of Twists and Turns,"This book kept me guessing from the beginning to the end. A great segment on Mardi Gras in New Orleans made me feel like I was there in the midst of the revelry. The story is steamy and engaging and full of surprises. I want to read another one just like it. The author gives you time to get to know the characters at the beginning and then moves you into a story you will have trouble putting down. It has a bit of everything--romance, suspense and intriguing characters--put together in a very satisfying way. A good story written well."
5,Good Equipment,"I purchased this because I do alot of number punching at work and I hate using the embedded keypad on the top row of the laptop I use. The install was easy and the driver also includes a calculator software with number transfering capabilities as well. I found it useless, but it [work for] many poeple's needs. My only Gripe is that the cable comes out of it on the right hand side, if you have it on the right side of the keyboard it has to go back around to the left side. No big deal but it is just kinda quirkie and thought that I would throw that in.Other than that it is awesome, the keys respond like it is an embedded keyboard and it doesn't hog a usb port, I know some have the hub but a co-worker has one like that and the hub on it doesn't work so I figured go with the Serial port and not use the USB... I own nothing else that uses a serial port so it works out great."
5,wonderfully not average,"I thought I might be taking a chance on ""Breakfast On Pluto"" but was completely delighted by the depth and richness of the story and characters, enhanced all the more by it's warm, glittery, soulful 70s soundtrack. Cillian is fantastic as Kitten. Superbly performed character. Very refreshing to hear and see such an unusual and well-crafted, well-produced dramedy. The title track sets the tone perfectly."
5,breakfast on pluto,luminous- thats one of the words I'd use to describe Cillian Murphy's performance here- this movie is not for the faint of heart- but if you enjoy Cillian Murphy- this performance should not be missed!
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"Both Cillian Murphy & Liam Nesson and among my favorite actors, but this movie is quite possibly the strangest thing I have ever seen. It had a few funny moments, so it gets a 2... but it was really basically unwatchable."
1,what a bomb!,"so the stories about twisted mind is now the trendy 'INs'. now we have to take a new look with more open-mind attitude toward those mix-ups in the closet. sexual misplacement or misidentity now is the talk of the movie industries, and when they produced, we have to spend money either watch them in the theatre or at home. great! this poor guy abandoned by his natural mother got the identity problem and he's trying to find his(her?) bio-mother, and two birds keep chirping and the white chalking sub chapters keep showing up one after another. the young actor later played a goofy role in the 'red eye'. yeah, right, he's definitely doomed to play the weirdos. what a pity and, what's the big deal?!"
4,The Gods of the Sunset Strip,"Somewhere on Tour, Maybe Cleveland, One of Many,Many Nights that all flow into One. The Plimsouls were on a Stage. Well, we got lucky at last !!! The Energy of One of those Nights, is Captured Right here on CD. YAAAH !!!This was the 80's that Nobody told you about, the Smelly, Sweaty Nights of Live Rock Bands that played in these Dark Little dives for Lot's of Fame but little Fortune.And the Songs: ""A Million Miles Away"", ""Time Won't Let Me"", ""Hush, Hush"", ""In this Town"" ...This Music is PURE and it's American. This Music was Played in 1966 and somebody will be out there in 2026 Playing it all over again, thank you Peter, Lou, Eddie and David-O for letting us Peek into your World...This is a very Cool CD..."
2,Misled,"Item is represented as ""vintage"" in product description. The length was really shorter than described as well as the color was not the same. The reverse side was not a solid color. Shipping was $4.50 for a piece of cloth that weighs 4 oz. I would not purchase from this company again."
2,Sybil Danning's Final Film is a Disappointment!,"Sybil Danning plays the character of Ruger in this dull and depressing action film. Danning trying hard to live up to being the Female Clint Eastwood, plays a character who is silent, smokes cigars, and lives is a run down trailer. She is a Bounty Hunter who is seeking the man who killed her partner. Wings Hauser plays the villian Cavanaugh (who steals the only good scenes in the movie)with his demented, crazed, coke-dealing, psyco artist who is completely over the top and out of his mind. Since Sybil only has about 4 lines in the movie and seems to have a bored expression on her face, she is not as fun to watch as she was in previous movies. It will pretty much disappoint her fans who are use to seeing her play sexy bad girls in some of the wildest costumes of all times. This was her final film, but not her best. This film could have been better perhaps if it would have had a bigger budget and better writing."
2,Sybil Schwarzenegger,"IN L.A. BOUNTY, Sybil Danning with her cigars, bleached perm and mid-drift bulge tries to out-macho Arnold Schwarzenegger, but fails miserably. The closest she gets to him is having been born on an American military base in Austria. After this dud, Danning appeared in the even-worse horror flick THE PHANTOM EMPIRE (VHS) (DVD), then took a well-earned 18-year hiatus from acting.Here, Wings Hauser is the homicidal kook that ex-cop turned bounty hunter Sybil pursues. Hauser has kidnapped a mayoral candidate and is after the man's wife, as well. Fearless, manly Sybil is the fly in his ointment. Results: lots of sound and fury, signifying crapola.As of 3/09, ""L.A. Bounty"" was not available on DVD.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.(3.7) L.A. Bounty (1989) - Sybil Danning/Wings Hauser/Leonore Kasdorf/Robert Hanley/Christopher Sullivan/Henry Darrow/Blackie Dammett/Frank Doubleday/Van Quattro"
2,Did not receive product & did not receive reply to inquiry,"I emailed Earth Parents on Feb 15, 2011 & requested info as to when they sent out the thermometer covers. To date, I have not received the covers nor a reply to my inquiry. I will hesitate ordering from them again."
4,Excellent SciFi from an Unlikely source,"Intelligent and well concieved SciFi from Altman. The world is dying. Glaciers have descended to engulf cities. A few heavily swaddled people have survived to create new power balances and priorities in the burnt-out husk of a culture. Infertile and without hope they await death while playing a dangerous gambling game called Quintet. One is reminded of Doris Lessing's ""The Making of the Representative of Plant 8"". The city is gorgeously created on the old site of Expo '67 - Montreal's World Fair. Dim lightbulbs hollow out melted rounds of ice inside the rooms. Excellent SciFi."
3,Leonard Maltin didn't get it,"While it isn't good box office, the film is an intriguing venture intointer-personal relationships vis-a-vis a board game where the loser pays withhis/her life. The referee is the real centerpiece of the story.. having never to put himself at risk, he is quite willing to sacrifice others; choosing on the basis of his personal bias. I enjoyed the departure from reality this film takes. This film requires the mind to interact with it in order to understand it. Leonard Maltin must have been pre-occupied. I was entertained."
4,Surprising good and worth a watch once. very 70s feel,"Loved it. Boring at times and unexpected from Altman and interesting Paul Newman performance. The pacing was not cool, all the 70s camera shots for the experience were a distraction at times. Score is very period and a tad annoying at times."
3,not as bad as the previous reviewers say,"No, it it not a great film, but by far better than 90% of the films that Hollywood dumps on us in 1999. It probably would be best on a large screen. It is visually appealing and the music is 5 stars."
2,My first Nicole Jordan book,"I don't know what I was expecting, but I was in for a surprise.I liked Diana very much, but I thought she was too stubborn on the not marrying. Then again, Christopher never told her he loved her--it took him forever to figure it out. And for someone who was SO concerned about scandal, she sure did court it...and oddly enough, repeatedly recover from it (after having been devasted by it years earlier).I didn't like Christopher as much; he seemed like a user to me. And why did he never make clear his sincerity about marrying her? I also found him a bit domineering. But I loved his place on Cyrene.The mystery was well done, I thought--plenty of pieces kept in play and resolved at the right moment. As for the sex...there was definitely plenty of it. In fact, there was so much, that it got really old, and I found myself groaning, ""Again?"" This relationship was more about lust than love, in my opinion."
2,"Quite frankly, I'm bored with it.","I've read many of Nicole Jordan's other books and wasn't really impressed with the story telling but I struggled through because they were very sensual and 'hot'. This one is not. I generally read a book or two a week and I've been reading this one for a week now. I'm not even half way done. This book is just a rehash of half a dozen other books which were all more interesting. He's got a tortured past and a secret he can't share. She's an artist, also with a tortured past, but she's an open book. They pretend to be engaged. There's some sort of nebulous danger. Boring. Deadly dull and I really wish I had another book to read. I have given up on this author and highly doubt I'll purchase the next book in this series. If I wanted to read bad romance I'd read Barbara Cartland. I'm certainly not willing to pay nearly $8/book to an author who's obviously not even trying."
2,"Much information, but bland","I expected a much more higher quality and interactiveness from a company as reputable as Microsoft. I found the writing to be bland and stale and somewhat difficult to stay focused. The presentations were done by people who have no emotion in their voice, and it is very hard to pay attention. They just seem to drone on and on. They could have also used a better example (they use the airport architecture which is also used in another design books). This was a major dissapointment. I would recommend the user rather find a book. It would be much easier to learn from then this mess."
2,Great to see 4 out of 5 members of The Band,Going to be honest. Not a great movie; but when 4 out of 5 members of the group THE BAND are in it....I'll watch it.
5,A fifties masterpiece BUT DON'T BUY THE VHS!,"A devastating satire of American culture. Could one accuse Tashlin of exploiting Jayne Mansfield's breasts for the sake of criticizing America's breast fetish? Probably, but Mansfield's performance is nothing short of fabulous. Problem: The VHS is pan and scan. This is simply unacceptable. If I were only allowed one video to be letterboxed in my collection, and accept pan and scan versions of everything else, I'd choose this one. That's right, not 2001, not anything from David Lean, not even my beloved _Manhattan_. Nope. This one loses all value in pan and scan. tape it off TCM next time around. Borrow or e-bay a laserdisc copy. e-mail Fox video and demand a DVD. Don't buy the VHS. It's not worth a penny."
2,Disappointing,"For a movie that advertises Sylvia Kristel (Emmanuelle) as one of its stars, I was expecting more. The luscious Sylvia is just a background player in this story about a bungled bank robbery. It's a foreign made movie and the voices are dubbed (very badly). It has the feel of an Italian exploitation flick and the acting is very hammy."
3,Bogie as missionary - surprisingly believable,"In this Movie Bogart and Dmytryk swap the mean streets of LA for the wilds of China. Bogie is convincing as a missionary priest, which is more than can be said of Lee J. Cobb, who plays a Chinese Warlord in a performance that would draw attacks from Chinese people to any theatre in which the film was exhibited today. It looks good, but it doesn't explore Bogart's moyives for being a missionary enough, it's a bit too pro-Christian, and even on it's own terms, it's not as good as The Inn of Sixth Happiness or Anna and the King of Siam"
1,not received,I never received the product ordered and reclamation has got any reaction. Please send my money back!Claus Gad
5,clark gable sans moustache,"I saw this movie about 25 years ago in a retro-theater in New York City. It is a must-see, if only for Clark Gable's naked face. And if you ever wondered why Garbo was such a big star, see this movie."
4,"So cute, great price!","Just got these in the mail today. I would say they run true-to-size. I wear between an 8 and an 8.5 so I always order the larger size and hope they don't fall off my feet. These stay on, so I'm happy. The toe is a nice updated round toe... not so round that your feet look stubby. The little wedge heel makes them much more comfortable than a completely flat shoe. One thing that I can tell is going to bother me is that the inside edge kind of cuts into my foot. I tend to have problems with shoes rubbing in that spot where there's not a lot of skin because I don't wear socks with them. Bottom line, I could do a lot of standing in these shoes, but not a lot of active walking. Otherwise, these are sooo cute and the price is fantastic!"
4,Wonderful Inspirational Music,"If you listen to no other song on this CD, a must listen is #8, Table of Friendship and Love. It is a tear-jerker, especially for kids that were trying to make friends in a new school."
2,The New English Bible.,Great price. Arrived very quickly. Bad translation only problem. What else can one say. Neeed to fill more wording requirement.
3,Grammar Book Review,This book provides a good general overview of grammar with lots of practice exercises with an answer key in the back. One major flaw with this book is that there are a number of mistakes. Some of the answers in the key are wrong which makes it very difficult to check your work.
3,"Mistakes, mistakes, mistakes....","This is a great book for teachers. It gives great tools and tests for teachers to use and give students to help them unlock grammar. However, it has many errors - many in the self-check answers section. Apparently, the wrong draft was sent to print (rumor I heard from a friend/co-worker of Lester's). I wish the publishers would print a revised edition. Without the mistakes I would give it five stars."
3,An Average Grammar Book,"With the exception of some ""tests"" the author has derived to check for different parts of speech, this book is quite average in its content, and the way it is organized makes it not very useful as a reference."
4,"Brilliant characters, gripping story","Although written out of my time, having lived and worked in Wales for over 20 years, I could see these characters. A really enjoyable read."
2,It lights up.. half the time,"I bought this light with the intentions that it would be decent for wedding videography. I used it one time and after that it wouldn't turn on unless you hit the back of it and the light would not stay in the place you put it in either, it continually falls down. I talked to customer service and they wanted me to pay my own shipping, almost 10 dollars, to send me another one, they would not give me a refund. I wouldn't waste my time if I was you. Try something a little stronger than plastic..."
3,Bluray pointless,The bluray version of this movie really is no better than dvd. So its basicly pointless to buy bluray unless its the same price or you like the pretty blue case.
4,His story,Its Eminem's story and if you believe the movie a good story. Music's pretty good. Its Brittany Murphy's remembered role.
3,not much better,"really like the movie, so i bought it for my blu ray collection.....was very dissapointed, looked the same as my dvd with not that many more extras"
2,Boring one eyed Cuban propaganda,"The Angolan conflict was my only area of interest in this book, and having read quite a few other books on the South African war in this region I sped quickly to this chapter.If I didn't know any better I would suspect that the author had vested interests in keeping the Cuban military in a good light through this section of the book. Any serious historians would baulk at the drivel written about the South African 'defeats' and I for one felt enraged at this blatant pro-Cuban military propaganda...very disappointing."
5,A new understanding of this forgotten involvement,"A wonderful account of Cuba's role in Africa. Few if any books exist describing the epic of the Cuban missions to Africa which cost thousands of lives and impacted a continent. Che's diary and `Guerrilla Prince' are the few books that detail this important facet of Cuban Policy. This book goes a step further from analyzing Che's first failed mission to the Congo to the final victory over South Africa in the Congo. The author describes the Battles as well as the diplomatic missions to such diverse places as Algeria. Everything is covered, from the breakup of the Portuguese empire to the revolutions in Guinea-Bissau. A wonderful singular account that will make you respect Cuba's exporting of revolution and introduce you to many interesting figures, especially opening up the void of African politics, which is all too often ignored.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,"Interesting, biased, but worth looking at","I didn't have the taste to finish this book, but I did read parts and I plan to keep it around as a nice reference. That is because while it is interesting and pretty well researched it is biased to the point of distortion. Facts become selective, motivations imagined, omissions crucial.On the other hand, the pro-Cuba bias in this book, while often heard on the internet and among certain pseudo-intellectual circles, is rarely presented in such a readable scholarly fashion. Also, the rare access that the author had makes the book valuable for just that point.In short, the book is very well made, but restrained by its status as a pro-Cuba polemic. Still even those without the pro-Cuba view (such as myself) can find it very interesting and useful, even if not worth reading end to end."
2,Kinda disappointed,"You would think with a tab booklet every song would be written in tabulature. You'd be wrong. Some songs are, some are not. I was disappointed considering Green Day's music isn't that technical. The entire book should be in tabs. Time of your life isn't in tabs either. Boo hoo."
2,"Sure, pay for guitar tabs, what's the point?!?","What's the point of buying guitar tabs when you can just search the net for free ones? I think I will give this book a two just because the riffs on some of Green Day's songs are pretty good, the only problem is that it is a Green Day product, and if I endorsed it by giving it any higher of a review, I would be supporting Wussie Rock, it's a new subgenre that I put Green Day into, judging from the fact that the main singer is a little fairy princess."
4,Accessible Yet Dated Survey Material,"This book is a collection of papers that survey the concept of intelligent software agents a.k.a ""software robots."" It is very accessible yet has the flavor of academic rigor in terms of citations etc. As of 2005, this material is decidedly dated; a whole era of dot-com boom and bust has happened in the interim. Most of the digerati academicians that have advocated, if not hyped, these technologies now have more modest consulting and academic lives now. Perhaps it is for the better for eventual real progress. Anybody seriously interested in this field must read this book to get grounded. A newer state-of-the-art survey book of its caliber is an unmet need at the moment. Would have been a 5 star review in 1999 but time corrodes."
3,"Slow start, good finish.","Hard to read but a good place to begin a child custody war. Ground work, evidence preparation and focus are his key issues. I urge caution on any step by step for every case. It took several monkey wrenches thrown in by the other attorney for me to learn that lesson. Some good points."
5,Child Custody A to Z,Great book you should get once you know you are or even somone in your family is getting a divorce. Covers everything that happens in a divorce and you can avoid mistakes that most people make. I know I made some and wish I had this book months ago.This is great for Dads and Moms and grand parents. It really is for someone who loves their children and wants to ensure they can get time with their kids.
1,Blank pages would have been just as useful,A waste of time and money. Get a lawyer if you really care about your child. You will not find any answers in this book. I found that out the hard way.
2,Custody Expert?,"This is another example of a self-described expert touting his information about his subject and eventually attempting to sell you his ""personal consultation"" on his web site. Like the other detectives, psychologists, attorneys and custody coaches he pushes the topic he knows as a cure-all. Guy may have the answer you are facing that you need a Gum Shoe for but he isn't the custody guru he claims to be. Find something with more areas of information. by Joon Bagnaschi"
3,Interesting and thought provoking,An unusual writing style and a new look at custody situations. Worth the $18.00
1,Very Disapointed,"This author has no clue. He thinks everything is going to work out just fine if you follow his simple advice and are a straight-shooter. Ask any dad going through a child custody case, things can go from OK to Hell in a matter of mimutes. I didn't find a single thing worth underlining. A better child custody book is, Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute, by Jeffery Leving and Ken Dachman. Another book that will help more is, The Anger Control Workbook by Matthew McKay,Ph.D. and Peter Rogers, Ph. D. The workbook will help you cope with the frustrations of valueless child custody books and the opposition in your custody case."
4,Child Custody,A very informative view for those who wish to begin the process for working towards physical or full custody of their child/children. The author provides the ground work that a parent seeking custody must be aware of to properly present his/her case and demonstrate this through evidence collected in a step by step process.
2,Too much self-congratulation,"The basic premise of this book is that everyone is incompetent: every lawyer, every judge and even the parents. The only smart person is the author and this tone gets tiresome fast. While there are a few tidbits here, Mr. White mostly brags about winning cases where the facts are on his side (so he won custody away from a woman who left her child alone each night while she partied and had affairs.... well, who wouldn't have won on those facts?).Asking your lawyer simple questions, like what do we need to prove our case and how can I help, should get you further than this book."
3,When you can Keep it Simple,"This book tells you what you need to know in a simple, straight manner. If you situation is standard and you need a book to take you through the paces, this is what you need. Recommend resource."
5,very informative,"gives a lot of insight from a guy who has a lot of experience in this sort of thing. I was surprised to see that his help and opinion weren't biased on gender, as many bitter people make it a gender war. He stays focus on the most important aspect and that is to prove one parent is better for the child over the other."
5,straightforward assistance for a sticky divorce,"This is a handbook for divorce where child custody is involved. Well written, down to the basics advice. I have read several others and the author gives real instrucuctions, not theory. Mr. White understands the template of custody and demonstrates how to move the chess pieces. There's strategy and chronologies in this book I haven't found in other books."
1,Disapointed,I bought this game thinking it would be cool because of the front cover and the back of it. But when you play it it impossible to kill anyone accept if you shoot every where and get lucky and hit some 1. Its real hard to control too.
4,"Good Writing, Some Of It About Music Sort Of","Make no mistake: this is a Richard Meltzer anthology, not an anthology of music writing. It's a funny and fine autobiography, produced piecemeal through the various obscure journals that indulged Meltzer over the years.As for music, there doesn't seem to be anyone Meltzer even remotely likes, except for Jim Morrison, and I wish Meltzer had a less embarassing idol than that ""crooner in the rock mileau."" Also, I was annoyed with Meltzer's potshots at music writers who became bigger than he did, specifically, Bangs and Christgau. He did it before Bangs, Meltzer reminds the reader, as if Bangs didn't do it better. As for his criticism of Christgau, it's strange, to say the least, for Meltzer, who makes a point of NOT listening to anything he reviews, to accuse the Village Voice reviewer of not listening hard enough. Huh?Still, a fun book."
2,Death by Ego,"Well, here's something new: a music critic who doesn't like music -- kind of makes me want to go to this year's National Embroidery Festival and write 50,000 words on it just for kicks. In truth, Meltzer's a lightweight bore. I'm sure in 1966 (or whenever he started writing about rock music, I forget exactly when it was and the thought of flipping back through this lame, vindictive volume again to check my facts fills me with dread) his stuff was ""interesting"" -- maybe even ""shocking"" -- but now it all sounds dated, disingenuous, and dumb. (Hey! That last line, with all the alliteration, was pretty good -- maybe I'll send it into CREEM magazine.....naw, Christgau will hate it.)"
2,just a dumb book,"Conan encouters little green men, giants, a wolfman, a catwoman, a wizard, and a four armed mutant -- all this and less in a story only a juvenile can enjoy. Thankfully, the book was short."
1,DON'T buy this!,"I would rate this 0 stars, but that's not an option.After 683 pages, the printer reported the cartridge as empty. I've used other brands of HP compatible toners and haven't had any problems with them before except for this one. I called their customer support line and it rang in India. I couldn't even understand the guy on the line. He basically told me to send an email to support@eradian.com for service. I did and that has gotten no where. Don't waste your time and money on this brand and company."
4,wonderful memories!,The CD was received a day early in great condition as promised.Thank you. I appreciate it!
4,Mature Mystery,This is not the usual light mystery associated with Agatha. Here she has called up the more mature dark Victorian style of her English heritage. I like the change and the unbalanced ending (more real-life.)
1,Ordeal by Innocence Video,"Ordeal by Innocence was one of Agatha Christie's three favorites. This video was not true to Dame Christie's style. Her books are gentile with fascinating plot twists and mystery. They don't have gore, suspense, violence, bad language, nor nudity. This movie had all those things and none of the Christie charm."
2,ANOTHER CANNON GROUP FLOP,"Ok. I admit that Dave Brubeck's music is a little bewildering in a movie based on a crime novel. It's a bad choice but it could please some viewers. The main problem of the film is however that, instead of masking the lack of depth of the characters, which is unfortunately Agatha Christie's trademark, the film shows only a succession of uninteresting dialogs and flashbacks."
3,heckle & jeckle Fox Hunt videotape,"simply a wonderful videotape from the age of Terrytoons, with the likes of mighty mouse, deputy dawg and of course heckle & jeckle;"
5,Adriana Varela is extraordinary!,I had never heard from Adriana Varela until last August - I do not come from South America - but I knew about tango and I am really pleased by her voice and most of all by her style: she sings classic tangos - from the 20s and 30s - in a way that makes them all new. Bravo.
4,"Good media, questionable customer service by seller","The DVD+R media is the best for data archiving and error correction and Taiyo Yuden makes the best media so does that mean that Taiyo Yuden is the best of the best? Maybe, all I know is the media works great in all my drives without any problems with a drive recognizing the media.This review is mainly about the media but I do want to insert a side note. The picture of the DVD+R media shown is inaccurate. The picture shows the media in a cake box spindle and what I received was a tape wrapped spindle with no cover. I contacted the seller and was told that there was an error in the picture but that they would ship out a cake box to me immediately. One month later and I am still waiting. Not a HUGE deal but, I kinda expected the cake box storage and as such I now have to find another way of storing the empty DVD's.Still a great value and a great product."
2,Dissapointed,Over 12 discs got rejected from my duplicating machine. When I tried them in my computer they also got rejected. I am constantly duplicating discs and get frustrated when I return to my project and find that a lot of them did not copy.
5,High quality and excellent value,"These DVDs are probably the highest quality and most reliable that I have tried. And given their low price, what is there not to like? I would recommend these to just about anyone."
3,"Good, but not overrated","This is a hidden gem; that's why it is only available in VHS. It is a funny spoof film about WWII films, in the style of Airplane or the Naked Gun. It is not as polished or as rapid fire with the jokes, but it does have its moments. I was please with my purchase. It was sealed in plastic wrap and the quality of the tape was excellent."
3,"There is more here, than meets the eye","I first saw this movie in 1958 just before going to Japan with the US Army. It made quite an impact on me and my expectations of the Japanese. The movie does successfully capture some of the Japanese spirit as I know it. John Wayne, though he has been panned in this role, I think, embodies what may have been an accurate portrayal of the typical well meaning American in a culture he could never understand. Years later, when I happened to be in Shimoda, where the film is set, I found a small Japanese Museum, that commorated the self-sacrifice of the Japanese woman, the lovely Okichi, to her community. It depicts the 'facts' of the movie in a totally differnt light.This movie really deserves to be put on DVD !!"
4,lost john wayne movie,"This is a movie not yet released in America. It is a foregin dvd, but in American. the movie is a little slow and different from the John Wayne action we are use to. But over all it is a great movie to watch."
5,A great job in restoring this film,"The BD is wonderful, and the sound is very good too. Just shows when the studios put time, and money to restore these old films what a good job they can do. Buy this film, I think you will enjoy it."
1,The Bargarian and the Geisha,I never received this product. I tried to buy this product but your machine put it as a down load. I have tried to have you correct this with no luck. My credit card account has been charged for the down load. Please get this corrected. I would still like to have the DVD.
1,hilarious,"This film is unbelievable. A one star recommendation is possible only because zero stars is not available. (maybe it should be five though). The sight of John Wayne stumbling around the Japanese sets makes it one of the funniest Wayne films ever (file under comedy). And he's made quite a few. He's still all over the place, mumbling and slouching like ever. How could they make this? One of the worst movies ever and therefore a must buy."
3,Entertaining John Wayne film,"It's fun, entertaining, but not one of Wayne's best. Nice photography and interesting story line. I cannot say that this is a must have film in your collection unless you are an avid John Wayne fan."
1,Attempted to view a different point of view,"But sadly I was let down, Every single thing they claim to be a fact can be easily disproven by Evolution. I really tried hard to Analyze this as much as I could but as usual Creationists try so hard to force opinion. If you have absolutely no education on Evolution then you can easily be duped but considering I am mastering in Paleoanthropology and minoring in Evolutionary Biology then I think I have a firm grasp on Evolution itself. Good try though but I do not reccomend this series."
1,Give Me A Break,"This video is complete nonsense. The thesis of the whole presentation can be summed up like this: ""Nature is extremely complex, therefore evolution is a crock."" or ""Look how amazing this is... there's no way THAT happened by accident!"". Apparently this dentist musician biology undergraduate has never actually learned the most basic principles of science and natural selection. It insults the intelligence with his pathetic attempt to rationalize what he was taught as a child and is unwilling to shake. Very shallow, a bad excuse for science, not recommended and especially dangerous for kids who might actually believe some of the stuff. They should change the title to "" Incredibly Ridiculous Pseudo-scientific Beliefs that Defy Knowledge, Reason and Overwhelming Evidence""."
1,Negative stars not possible,"I cant believe this..... thousands of years of progress and now we start heading backwards.... if it were up to people like the producers and viewers of this DVD we never would've had the technology to make DVDs!!!!!Idiots might disagree and make a stupid claim that technology has nothing to do with evolution (or science for that matter). But if the divine is the explanation for everything, then the periodic table would not exist ('Water is too perfect to be a simple cobination of Hydrogen and Oxygen'.... 'they're both gas' the Intelligent designers would claim). We'd be taught that the earth is the center of the Universe (why qestion the bible?) and so on and so forth."
3,dissapointed,"The information is moderately interesting, but the presentation could be much better. The music in the background is annoying and the misrepresentation of Scripture is distasteful. It will not be one I keep in my collection."
1,Fantasy on Parade,"This represents yet more creationist fantasy. There is no science used to come to the conclusions as they already have a fairy tale answer in this series. It amazes me the lengths creationists go to limit the way their supposedly ""all powerful"" god creates. This is well suited for simpletons and those lacking critical thinking skills."
1,False Information,"I am not an atheist and actually am very interested in both sides, but this video has so many false segments and facts. He says that scientists haven't figured out how to create cold light like a firefly can. This statement is FALSE! I have actually created the exact same light a firefly uses in a lab and it is very easy. It's the same light a glow stick uses. So I still believe that evolution is the best know explanation we have for explaining the life we have today. I mean I'm not saying there are no flaws in evolution, but it is definitely the best way to explain the world around us."
3,I got it as a gift for hubby,I got this as a gift for my hubby. He said he wanted to watch it so I got it for him to see what he thinks. I can't tell you from experience if it was any good. I will try to update later.
5,Evolutionary theories defied by Nature!,"Every school student and every thinking adult should view this series of videos! After they do, they will have a greater understanding of what is and what isn't possible with the theory of evolution. It is simply amazing - beautifully filmed and inspiring. There is nothing made up here - it simply puts the facts before the viewer and lets them decide."
1,Should be in the fictional sections,"This video is so full or nonsense it shouldn't be allowed to be watched by anyone. Any person with even the most rudimentary understanding of evolution can answer every question posed in this ""Documentary."" There should be some type of warning letting individuals know that this film in no way actually represents any type of scientific knowledge."
5,True Science,"These videos are amazing. They reveal things most ""scientists"" today would deny. I have looked for rebuttal information, but have found none. ""Science"" does not have an answer. It would be interesting to see the reaction if these videos were shown in todays ""science"" classes. We all know that will never happen because ""science"" today is closely guarded as to the facts that are presented. If it doesn't support the current mindset, then it is excluded. When I studied science, we were presented with all scientific discoveries, regardless of where the information took us, and we were allowed to draw our own conclusions, and then test those conclusions further to either prove or disprove them. Today, children are not allowed to think, but this series is thought provoking."
2,Very irregular collection,"Patente de corso is a selection of the articles that Perez Reverte has published in magazines and newspapers. Not very interesting because the articles are very centered in the day by day situation. Of course there are some very good articles (specially when Perez Reverte attacks other writers), but other are mediocres. Better if you buy the novels, not this book."
2,"Luis Miguel, México en la piel","Luis Miguel es muy bueno para cantar, pero realmente para este tipo de música no lo es tanto."
3,Mexican Pride,"Luis Miguel is extremmely proud of his Mexican roots and on this CD it shows. Luis Miguel does a more than adequate job singing these traditional Mexican ballads. It is a must have, for those who love mariachi music!"
2,Luis Miguel is no mariachi,"Luis Miguel has a pleasant and distinctive voice, but it doesn't work in ranchera. This music form needs the earthiness of Vicente Fernandez, the dark sex appeal of Alejandro Fernandez, or the romantic heroism of Pablo Montero, none of which are present in Miguel's voice. His version of ""Cruz de Olvido"" suffers terribly in comparison to Pablo's; it has no emotion at all and I am surprised at the musical arrangement for it, which sounds so trivial by comparison to every other version I have ever heard. Even Mariachi Vargas, who are normally brilliant, are not at their best here.Sometimes good singers make bad career decisions. If Luis Miguel wants to sing ranchera, he needs to work harder at it."
4,Luis Miguel is a big star - BUT so are Mariachi Vargas,"I've always loved Luis Miguel and have had his Segundo Romance in my cd player for 7 years, BUT, this cd would not have been possible without the incredible arrangements and back up of Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan. They have been in the business for over 100 years and are considered the best mariachi in the world. So what's my gripe? They are not recognized on this album anywhere. Where are their album credit(s)?? In the inside back cover is a tiny mention of them (and I mean tiny - you can't read it without a magnifying glass).I would have expected more class from Luis and WEA.But, don't let it stop you from buying the cd. Vargas rocks and they take Luis Miguel along for the ride."
3,I like the original version better,"I liked this CD, but I like the original version of ""Mexico en la Piel"" better.I got it at: http://lachicharrarecords.com/"
5,PERFECT!,"I have to admit that I had to hear the album a couple of times before I realized how great it is. Most of the songs have been performed by various artist before, so its hard to get used to a different version right away. After hearing it a few times you start to enjoy and appreciate the quaility of this production. It is much more than just another Mariachi cover album. This production is great! Luis Miguel as always sounds great and the music arrangements are very creative. This is another collection album such as the ""Romances"" albums and the songs are remakes, but Luis Miguel gives them the touch of class and makes them his own with his personal style and perfection. A keeper."
3,Luis Miguel Mejico en la Piel,"You have an excellent service.I already get my purchase and everything is ok, as usually."
5,Mind Blowning,"Xandy Barry's album is absoulty mind blowing. He takes a step in a new direction with his unique sound and original sound. In a time where it feel like all new bands were made in a factory from one mold, Xandy comes along and shows that there is still hope... A need to buy.. A must have for your collection, cause this guy's going places..."
5,Definitive work on the art & science of precision warfare,"Mr. Hasik and Mr. Rip have written the finest unclassified work on how GPS and inertial guidance (with their supporting technologies) have revolutionized warfare. Although the underlying math is explained in excruiciating detail (for a liberal arts major), it is more than compensated for by outstanding case studies. As a professional military officer with service in the US Army and Air Force, I found this book to be required reading for those in the profession of arms or those who seek a greater undrestanding of the basis of the United States' current military dominance."
1,Missing towel in the package,"I liked the towels. The problem was I received only 3 units of the 4 I have bought and properly paid.When I made a bad review of this situation, I received an email from Amazon saying my review couldn't be accepted because I wasn't talking about the towels themselves. Well, towels are very good ones.The problem is there's no way to communicate with a human being at Amazon and solve a real problem.They instructed me to go to the Amazon feedback section, but believe it or not, my order of towels has mysteriously disappeared from my list of orders. Hundreds of other of my orders were there except the one they already knew I had problems.Very disappointed with the service and the customer support. Far away to be a transparent and ""problem solving"" attitude"
3,What are you getting?,Like to order but how many are included? For forty dollars I would assume there is more than one but the description doesn't state the number anywhere...
2,Fabric Content Has Changed,"I purchased Pinzon towels a few years ago and they are wonderful, soft and beautiful. The fabric content on them is 70% Bamboo, 30% Cotton. I bought Pinzon towels recently (Feb.2012) because I wanted more beautiful towels, but did not read that they are now made from 100% cotton. The change to 100% cotton now makes the towels less soft and I am returning them because they are ordinary and not luxurious and because cotton towels can be bought much cheaper than the Pinzon towels. These are not exceptional towels."
4,Pinzon Luxury washcloths,I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of both the towels and washcloths. I would recommend them and I will buy them again.
5,WOW Great Towels!,What beautiful towels! They are the equal of anything I've ever used...no matter where I've stayed! You won't be disappointed.
4,Great quality for the price of the towel.,"I bought these towels about a year ago (May 2009) and love them! They are plush, thick, and absorbant! I agree with other opinions found here...if you do not use fabric softener, and they will stay absorbant. The only complaint I have is my Sage-colored towels are very faded one year later. They would have been perfect, if they didn't fade so much. I would buy again, but I think I will try a different color this time around."
2,Too Heavy,"Towels are probably something you should purchase after feeling them, not on-line. This towel is ridiculously heavy and too large. On a positive note, you can skip your morning work out with the free weights."
2,"Soft, good size, hope you don't like the color","I was pleased with the towels on receipt, so I proceded to wash them to remove lint,etc. I had just finished a load of dark clothes, so I filled the washer with cold water and half the amount of Tide liquid. I washed per the instructions, dried on low heat. When I removed them, 2 of the three towels and 3 of 6 wash cloths had yellow blotches as if bleach or something were splashed on them. Previous or subsequent loads had no similar problems. To the credit of the towels, they did remain soft and did not shrink. They'll be great for camping. I'll have to go elsewhere to buy ones for the bathrooms."
5,Amazing towels,These towels dry extremely well. I bought the bath towels. They're really heavy which takes some getting used to but they dry so well it is worth it. Highly recommend them.
2,Way too dense,"I bought these thinking that the 820g weight would be a good thing, which it would have been on a terry towel, but these are to tightly woven that the weight makes the bath sheet unweildy. As others have noted, they take forever to dry. The colors are duller than in the photos, as well."
5,Pure Luxury!,"I could hardly believe it when I opened the package. I've been buying high-quality bath linens for a long time, and I'd never encountered anything like this! The Pinzon bath sheet is huge, and very thick and absorbent. I bought this first, because, well, I needed a bath sheet, and the place where my other towels came from no longer offers this color. But I will be replacing all my towels with Pinzon."
4,Bath Sheets are REALLY huge,There towels are really nice. I only wish I had gotten the Bath Towel size instead of the Bath Sheet size. They are enormous!
3,"Not that soft, but otherwise nice","These towels are the quintessential mid-grade. They're not nearly as soft as the expensive bath towels I have but are much nicer than ""cheap"" towels that you can buy for a few bucks. Since they're just hand towels, I don't mind that they're not that soft - but if you're looking for a high quality tower, then look elsewhere."
1,Waste of Money,"I should have known I was in trouble when I opened the packages and it says ""no returns"". Hmmm...thanks for telling me in advance. I washed the towels before use and immediately they faded and shrank. Plus they filled my washer with huge amounts of fuzz. Great. Then I tried to use them after a shower. The towels don't absorb water, wick water or do anything else - they just push the water around on your body/face/hands. So you stay wet and the towel feels a little damp. Total waste of money, time and resources. So disappointed."
3,Color fades,"Great when it comes to softness, fluffy/ thick, but man...the color faded a lot with the first wash! (Marine/ Blue color)"
2,Dye not colorfast,"I've had two of these towels (""plum"" color) for about six weeks. The dye is not colorfast. Even with just regular usage (Ivory soap / Head & Shoulders shampoo / laundry soap) the towels are changing from purple to pink in spots.If you want these, I'd avoid the ""plum"" color."
2,towel set,Not impressed. hems started to unravel after first washing. Too expensive for such an inferior product. Don't waste your time or money.
5,Niiiiiiice!,I bought the hand towel first to see what the fabric was really like. I was impressed. So then I bought the bath towels in white because I wanted to feel like I was at some posh hotel or spa! Absorbent and hefty...good choice.
1,Came apart!,"I bought this set in Sept 2012. My wife and I each have a washcloth, hand towel, and bath towel. She only uses the washcloth to wash her face at night. By January, four months later, she could see through part of her washcloth!! And, now, the whole is big enough to fit her finger. My washcloth is fine. She does not use heavy make-up or any atypical face wash. So, I gotta figure we got a bad towel. I contacted Amazon, and they said they could do anything about it. The rest of the towels are fine and I actually like their weight and absorbancy, but buyer beware."
4,My Mom wanted thick towels.,I've never had such thick heavy towels. My mom is 81 and she loves them.Someone wrote that they might be too heavy for older people. That would probably be true if they were pretty frail. My mom does fine and she is not one to work out.There is a LOT of lint the first few times you wash them. I washed them for her twice before giving them to her.
3,Thick and Soft.......BUT.....,Yes these towels are soft.....Yes they are thick.....BUT !!!!!! They take forever to dry in the Dryer.....Would not buy them again.....
1,Gambled and lost,"Read the number of 5 star reviews and weighed them against the number of 1 star reviews. I thought the odds were in my favor. Unfortunately i experienced the same ""bleach spots"" others complained of. Will try to return or exchange."
3,very soft and absorbant really like. only thing i dont like,is the strip of no plush. it seems to be in a strange place. you lose a good chunck of the washcloth. . will not buy this type again. Will check to see solid plush.
3,Towels,"Great color selection. Bath towel are thick, drys well, takes a while to air dry, Too thick for everyday use--maybe lower 700 gram would be better."
4,Thick and Luxurious,"The Pinzon Luxury 820-Gram Cotton Washcloth is a beautiful white, thick, and luxurious. I haven't had the opportunity to test out how well it handles the laundry, but it is wonderful to use."
2,pilling pilling pilling,"my order of two towels, bath sized, chocolate, just arrived. the first thing i did was wash them. while drying them, they 'pilled' to such an extent that they shut down the dryer 3 times before they were dry. i've never run into this before and wonder if the quality is so bad that they give up so much 'material'.i wonder if this will stop with use?if i had known this, i would not have bought these, i would have chosen a better brand."
2,"Thin, not luxery towels","I bought a set of Hotel Collection Turkish towels at TJ Maxx and love them and wanted more than what they had at TJ Maxx. I bought the Pinzon towels thinking they would be as nice or nicer. The difference is night and day. The Pinzon towels are thin, not very soft and the colors are dull. I don't know how they claim to be 820 weight since they are lighter than a 700 gram weight towel. The Pinzon towels are not as described, but are inferior--like Martha Stewart towels."
3,Thick...,"This towel is really thick. Not just thick towel thick but blanket thick. If your power goes off you could use it to keep warm. It feels heavy to lift and weighs close to 3 pounds. So unless you want something that thick, be warned. The problem with such a thick towel is that if you use it after your morning shower by the next day it won't be dry, will start to sour and you'll have to wash it every time you use it.But it is a nice thick bath sheet.This is the problem with amazon, which normally I love. You can't pick up a towel and feel how thick it is. So it's hard to know if it is for you."
4,Best bath towels I have ever had!,They are incredibly soft yet durable. These are the finest towels I have ever purchased and would highly recommend them!
4,huge towels!,"I ordered two of these towels. They are really big which is what I wanted. They are also pretty ""thirsty"". But be aware that they are very heavy. I don't know if another manufacturer makes large bath sheets that are not so heavy or not, but these weight a ton. Other than that, they seem to be great towels."
3,"Heavy, but doesn't feel that nice","This is a big, heavy towel, and yes, it does look luxurious, but it just dosn't feel that good against my skin. It's rather harsh feeling, combined with the weight and bulk, is not something I like to wrap myself in after a bath."
2,Poor service,"Was not sent the color I ordered, but decided to tolerate it rather than go through the hassle of returning it. I am still disappointed."
4,love bamboo towels,"Started using bamboo towels after Consumer Reports had an article on them a while back. Soft and they literally wick the water right off of you. One downside is the maintenance, you have to remember not to use fabric softener on them."
5,Love it!,These are so thick and absorbent ! I put them in my Brookstone towel warmer and its like being wrapped in a blanket when you get out of the shower. They do take longer to dry but that is to be expected with such a luxurious product.
2,Not very absorbent and pilled quickly,These towels are super heavy but they don't absorb water well. Also they pilled within a couple of months with normal washing
2,Disappointed after having Bamboo,"I had previously purchased Pinzon towels with Bamboo. I thought I would give these a try since about the same weight as previous Bamboo towels and had the color I wanted. Nothing compares to the softness of Bamboo towels. After one washing these were already no course and not soft. The difference in drying with softness vs. sandpaper. Get the towels with Bamboo, you will not be sorry."
3,"good quality, but too dense","The quality is good, but the fabric is so dense it actually doesn't work as well as a less dense towel. It does not absorb water very well and takes longer to dry off after a shower then other, less dense towels."
1,Horrible towels,"I would not recommend these towels to anyone. It is a bit coarser than any towel should be and after drying myself a few times, the towels have mysteriously started to change color. I put them in the wash and it got worse. Not very good towels at all. Very disappointed. I also bought the washcloths as well, same problem."
1,Don't buy it,"The towels don't hold their color. After the first wash, there were large areas where the color washed out and they looked like they were 5 years old. Don't waste your money."
3,I thought it would be softer than it is.,"I bought this towel thinking it would be very thick and soft. It is heavy, but not very soft, and I am not sure where the weight is coming from. It almost feels like a very thick, tightly woven carpet. But it does the job; it is large and it dries me."
2,Washcloth too heavy,The towels may be great but the washcloth is too thick and weighs a ton when wet. My wrist actually hurt after I finished my shower. I won't use this again.
2,Color of towel is actually not what is displayed in ad,"I am very disappointed in this product. It is advertised as a plum-colored towel and the picture of it has it looking like a bright and deep plum. In actuality, it is a dull, muted shade. When you're buying a towel online, the colors have to be true to the picture, or else what good is it??"
5,Got it Cheap for $2.50,"This is a very high quality product. Very soft, comfortable and thick and best of all i got in extreme sale for $2.50 each. Very happy with the quality and the price !!"
4,"Ok, but ...","The Pinzon Bath Towel appears to be well-made and is quite plush and soft. It is also quite large and looks rich and luxurious hanging on the towel rack.Unfortunately, in terms of function - its ability to dry you after you shower or bathe - it is not significantly better than my Target-brand cheapies. Despite the towel's plushness, it is not as absorbent as you might expect based on it thickness and weight.I thought that, perhaps, the manufacturer had treated the towel with fabric softener to make it feel soft to prospective buyers but which would also partially waterproof it. But after laundering (without fabric softener), I found little improvement in absorbency.If your towel's appearance is important to you, these are fine and work reasonably well. If your considering it as a functional improvement over your current towel, I think you'll be disappointed."
1,"Great Towel, but Buyer Beware","As others have written, this is a high-quality towel. Buyers should be aware, though, that the seller permits ONLY exact exchanges. In other words, if you are dissatisfied with the towel or the color is not as expected, you will only be able to exchange it for...the exact same towel. Not a very good policy! I'm stuck with a nice towel in a color I did not expect."
3,Too Good,"I bought only washcloths, not towels. These washcloths are too thick to be really good at their purpose. It is like trying to scrub with a small rug! One can't complain about their structural quality, it is good. But their usefulness for the purpose for which they were intended is not so good."
3,Satisfaction level depends on intended use...,"For me, I didn't really like this towel. It looks good but isn't that useful for me. It was too heavy, big and bulky and not all that absorbent. I like a towel that I can dry off with and then use to wrap around my hair while I get ready. The towel is way too heavy to use as a hair wrap.But if I was going to the beach and wanted something to lay out on or for the dogs to lay on, it would do okay."
5,Heavy luxurious,I like thick washcloths and towels.... These are extremely thick... Feels great to use... Washes beautifully... Recommend them to anyone who likes the feel of luxury
1,Pilled on first wash! Save your time and money.,I was so excited to get these new towels. Put them in the wash today and carefully followed the wash/care instructions and they pilled immediately with the first wash!
5,WOW!!,"These towels are amazing! They are thick and much bigger than a standard towel, but not as big as a bath sheet. They are soft, and cozy. This particular color is so unique and I love that as well. They are worth every penny. They are great quality and will last much longer than standard towels."
4,So Soft,I love these washcloths. They are thick and nice. I like a washcloth that has weight to it with great quality. It comes highly recommended.
1,waste of money,"these things are very coarse. For the money, I expected a much softer towel for my face and hands. I bought better towels at target for less."
4,"Heavyweight, absorbent, but not so soft after washing","These enormous bath sheets, labeled with Amazon's own Pinzon brand name, are a delight to step into after a shower, although, after laundering, the feel is more dense than soft. After just one washing, they feel almost like a bath mat, but thicker. The terry loops are short and tightly packed, resulting in a towel that weighs a ton and that whisks water quickly away from the surface. Unlike other towels I've bought over the years, these don't shed tons of fibers that stick to my skin or clog my dryer's lint filter. The last, super soft towels I bought did just that -- and I had to be careful drying my hands before putting in my contacts.Although I wish these bath sheets were a tad softer, I would buy more in the future without hesitation. I get instant, dry warmth when I step into one."
4,Thick and absorbent towel,"Whether you will like this towel or not is very much a matter of taste. I personally think they are excellent towels. They are absorbent. They are pleasant to the touch without being overly silky or soft. I did not find them rough. They are very thick, which does make them a little heavy. I have had no issues with either color loss (I have a purple towel) or the towels shedding. They don't seem to take any longer to dry than other thick towels.If you are looking for something very soft or silky you will not want this towel. If you are looking for something thick and absorbent these might be the ones for you."
1,soft but bad quality!,"These towels were nice and big, heavy and soft, as promised! I was excited when I first opened up the package. But after washing them, I was immediately dissapointed. I bought 2 towels, a blue one for my husband and a purple one for me. Upon the first washing, my purple towel got these pink bleached streaks all over the place! But my husband's blue towel (which was washed together with my towel) came out perfectly fine. I was going to forgive the Pinzon people, thinking my is just a fluke. But lo and behold, 2 days later, my husband's blue towel developed yellowish bleached streaks! OUt of nowhere! I was my towels at home, so I am positive there was no bleach in my washing machine, plus I had washed other towels along with them, and those came out fine. I want my money back, sir! These bleach stains are NOT pretty! :("
2,Loverly Towel Frayed Edges,These highly absorbent towels have a near immediate tendency to breakdown and fray at the edges
3,Good overall towel,"Solid towel, but a little rough. These will last forever.Note, these are heavy though, so keep that in mind if that is a concern."
2,Not great,"Feels like a bath mat, instead of a towel. Too thick, too hard, does not dry well. I do not recommend this product."
4,blood legacy............it really happened,"My name is lori coco and I am the grandaughter of the woman in this book. I just wanted to thank the writer, Judith ,for finally making public aware of the the families side of this horrible ordeal. And may my grandfather, Bob, finally rest in peace with all the dignity he deserves. Thank you for reading my comments, If people realized what a horrible time in our lives that this represented and what destruction it has caused the families involved. My life will never be the same. I hope this helps everyone remember that sometimes justice is served even if it takes a very long time to happen."
4,Good if used for the gym,"These work well in the gym, where you may want to switch between face climbs and crack climbs and don't want to deal with tape gloves on the face climbs or taking tape gloves on or off. They offer excellent protection for the hands. The downside is that they are much thicker than tape gloves or bare hands, and can turn a thinner hand crack into a finger crack. Because they can get in the way, they aren't as useful in performance situations. You probably won't want to use them outdoors. I got these mainly for my first crack climbs, when I was still learning and my hands weren't used to it yet, and for that they are particularly great."
3,They worked,"I am not a fan of tearing up my hands and I often feel insecure jamming in a crack anyway. Sure it might be cheating, but then again these glove made me feel more comfortable with crack climbing and so more willing to do it. It might not be pretty while I'm up there but the alternative is playing belay slave to my husband and that's no fun... On the advice of another reviewer I smeared a healthy coat of SeamGrip on all of the seams. The stitching is necessary, but the makers should have done this themselves because it is pretty obvious that the seams would not hold up long. I did have to reapply seamgrip after the trip as it had started glue had started peeling some. Maybe I should have cleaned them better the first time. Overall they performed as intended and kept my thin bony hands from being tortured."
5,GREAT HELP!,"This book is superb. It is the best book on Anxiety that I have read. I have suffered from OCD, depression and anxiety my whole life, and this book taught me more then I learned with most of the therapists. If you are suffering, BUY THIS BOOK, and work on it. You will find advice & relief and hope :)"
4,Cruise Control,"Entertaining fiction combined with a lot of important factual information that was obviously well researched. Reading this novel is a good way to educate oneself about the tremendous challenges that modern tourism and some fishing methods cause to the long term viability of the beautiful islands, reefs, and waters of the Carribean Sea. It's sad to learn how little the majority of citizens on many islands profit from the tourism industry. A quick read; informative, interesting characters and plot."
5,Super sucker dehumidifier,"Nice fit and finish. Reasonably quiet. The main objective of this device is to remove moisture from the air and it really can do that. It can fill it's 30 pint collection container in less than 24 hours. The water bucket is very sturdy and has a great handle for carrying. It came complete with it's own hose in case you want to use it directly into a floor drain. Additionally, you can switch back and forth between bucket collection and direct floor drain usage. I'm very satisfied with the quality and value. Let's see how it holds up under cooler temperatures in the winter and what the reliability/durability factor ends up being."
3,Not what they claimed,"This book was listed as new, not used, but has a pronounced musty smell and a tear in the dust jacket. Obvoiusly a used book, and not in pristine condition. Also, the paintings presented are those found in only two museum collections, Boston and the Metropolitan - a good sampling, but not complete."
2,Psycho Madness,"I saw this film shortly after it was made, cut on a movieola and with a score at least partially written by my brother in law, an Emmy award winning and academy award nominated composer, arranger, orchestrator.It is a slasher film made, I believe in the same building were ""Police Academy was shot...amongst other Toronto locations.Michael Bockner is a thoughtful and driven writer...I believe this was his first film - he is shooting in Toronto as I write this."
5,AWSOME,I NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE BUT I AM GOING TO RENT IT FOR SHORE.I AM SHORE THAT THIS WILL BE A 5 STAR MOVIE.PS. I WILL WRITE A NOTHER REVIEW AS SOON AS I SEE IT.DATE. FEB.8 2003TIME. 5:07 A.M
5,The Spanish Bridegroom,"The Spanish Bridegroom is my favorite book of all time. It shows incredible insight into the life of Phillip II of Spain,Queen Elizabeth's arch enemy. Even though he was an ardent champion and defender of Papal catholicism at the very height of the inquisition, Jean Plaidy has you empathizing and even rooting for him. Plaidy sets you down in that world and there you stay until the book regrettably comes to an end leaving you thinking about, and in my case, missing the characters for years.(I first read it in the late 1970's and I still think about it).Honest to God... you really need to read this book.Charles w Johnson"
1,don't bother,"I would have given this a 0 star if that had been an option. If you grind for a minute or so you might get a few grains out, if the planets are inalinement."
3,Just another band....,"Bandana is a pre-created band by the Tv Show ""Pop stars"", this is their second album...It's not right, but it's OK.The album counts with some stupid songs... and similar sounds... nevertheless I do not recommend this album if you are elder than 12 year.."
3,"Insightful, Repetitive","Pearce has been a notable champion of Catholic and Christian English writers, and this book doesn't disappoint in that respect. That being said, the book is essentially an anthology of previously written (if not published) pieces on the Catholic literary revival in England. Half the book is about the Chesterbelloc (a term you will be thoroughly sick of hearing by that section's end), and various fragments on Tolkien. The cover also depicts Dante and Shakespeare, but they don't feature very prominently in the work itself. I was ultimately disappointed with the constant repetition, which is a risk in an anthology-type work. I would suggest reading Pearce's other works, especially his biographies. Then, if you can't get enough, come back to this one."
1,More Fodder for the Misinformed,"Another example in the disturbing trend of tabloid historical writings that should be more appropriately marketed as fiction. Like other books in this genre, this book makes remarkable allegations without the slimmest of support. To make its point, it piles inferences upon factual distortions, and the result is a slanderous attack on institutions and individuals that virtually all reputable historians have panned for its irresponsibility. Books like this are not written as serious history; rather, they are written to pander to a public who will buy and believe uncritically -- which is why half the American public believe that JFK had an affair with Marilyn Monroe. If you must read this, borrow it. Do not reward these authors by buying this book, because that will encourage more struggling writers to make a fast buck with the next book like this one."
1,Any club will do,"If you think RFK killed Marilyn and that the CIA is poisoning your tapwater, you'll love this book. The Vatican ends up being pro-Nazi, pro-Communist, and pro-CIA: all at the same time. Gentleman, when you put your white sheets on and decide to do a little anti-Catholic hate work, can't you get your story straight?"
1,Isn't it funny?,"Isn't it funny that those posting negative reviews here write better, and seem better informed, than those posting positive reviews? That alone speaks volumes as to whom this book appeals."
3,Unholy Trinity,"Good material but writer's style of proses is somewhat dry. With this type of material, it is essential to keep the reader engaged. Valuable information but needs more than breaking down historical events."
4,"What the ""Hell""","Are we mad, or just brain dead. How in the ""Hell"" did we allow the propagander machine to cause blind (unjust) justice to rule in the name of Hitler, and his Total desruction of nations."
4,Uplifting and with the times,"This Kiss single features a very uplifting song ""We Are One"". Not only are the lyrics great but the guitar fits the song perfectly and it sounds as if the lyrics may have come from personal experiences within the band. I would not recomend this as a first Kiss CD but any loyal and long time KISS fan should buy it. It features the Psyco Circus video and two versions of ""We Are One"". For the price offered here, your sure to get your moneys worth."
3,Great Strength Training portion of video,"I wasn't a huge fan of the pilates, it was very dry and boring but I really liked the strength training portion of this video."
1,Dissapointed,These DVDs do not work in my Sony DVD player and will cost too much p&p to send them back!! Really annoyed and dissapointed!!
1,"Got this as a gift, not as helpful as I would have hoped.",This was a lot of fluff not what I expected. Not true to the trimester workouts that I would want to follow during pregnancy :( disappointed. Misleading....
2,not happy with this dvd,"I was very excited when I first rec'd this dvd workout. However, I'm disappointed because the quality is pretty bad (I thought it'll be HD or something nice) and the workout is just too boring."
5,Perfect Collection,"This covers everything I want in the set. The yoga is relaxing and tailored well for each trimester and taking care of morning sickness among other things, the pilates is more of a workout with proper modifications and guidance for each trimester, including breaking down items between the first part and second part of your third trimester while the overall training video is the most active, with three models showing how the exercise should be done based on where you are. Overall I like that I can do different things based on how I feel or what I need."
1,disappointing!,"Overall, the dvds seemed to be kind of a low-rent production. I'm willing to overlook the home video-esque production value for a good workout, but was disappointed there too. First, the strength training dvd is lead by a super-skinny blond with gigantor fake boobs -- just what every pregnant woman is looking for: a workout with a Hooters waitress. Plus, the workout is awful, lots of exercises that have you do 30+ reps in a row of something (can we break this up into sets?). In addition, it did not seem well tailored to a proper and safe prenatal workout. Annoyed, I moved on to the yoga dvd, hoping for better. The Hooters-girl was gone, but the yoga routine seemed disjointed and slow paced (even for a beginner). Honestly, I gave up prior to the Pilates dvd, so in fairness, I can't comment on that. in short, save your money and opt for one of the many other great prenatal workout dvds on the market!"
2,Would not reccomend,"I was in pretty good shape pre-pregnancy and looking for something to keep me in shape. I really enjoy Jillian's 30-day shred and was looking for something along those lines (20-25 minute workout w/cardio + strength) but with safe moves for pregnancy and some options as I get bigger. This is definitely not it.The overall quality of all dvd's was poor; bad selection of instructor's, settings, and pace. The strength routine dvd was ok but slow moving with too many reps at a time. The yoga was way too slow and boring to even get through and the pilates was ok as well but slow with a strange announcer voice telling you instructions. I haven't found a great pre-natal dvd yet but this one is definitely on the low end for workout and quality of dvd's."
3,Took a while not entirely worth the wait,I like the idea of the product but after doing hot yoga and full on Pilates it was way more stretching then anything. It also took a lot longer then expected to receive the product. Good price though
4,great options,"I haven't tried all of the workouts yet, but have enjoyed the ones that I have done. Very directional, especially the yoga. I was doing P90X prior to pregnancy and this strength training was still up to par. I recommend! There are 3 girls in each video and you follow the one in your trimester. Easy to know what to modify accordingly to use your whole pregnancy."
1,Would not recommend,"I was excited to order this but very disappointed when I received it. You expect the person on the cover to be the instructor or student and it seemed she was neither. This is packaged to be very modern, but the yoga portion looks very outdated. Instead of an acutal workout, it just shows you yoga poses. The strength portion isn't bad. It has one woman in each trimester doing the workout so it's easy to follow. Overall, I'm disappointed and would not recomment this."
5,Something For Every Day,"I got this box set because it had 3 very different DVDs in it. I've done Pilates before for and I know I like it so that one attracted me to the set. With pilates, yoga and cardio, and so many different workouts on each one, I can find something to do on any day and pick based on what I think will be best that day."
3,"Great "" Tone & Fit"" section, but the rest it too easy","The Strength Training DVD is great, especially 20min Pilates section, really makes me feel like I'm exercising. That's why I was so disappointed when I tried the actual Pilates DVD in the set. Way too easy & slow( I tried the section for the 2d trimester, that's where I'm right now, maybe I should try the first & see if it's better) Not using Yoga DVD at all- after doing Ashtanga & Power Flow yoga for 5 years before getting pregnant this DVD is just not enough. If you're looking for better option for pregnancy yoga try "" Complete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga 2DVD set""!"
3,Everything but the yoga,"This is my first pregnancy and I had recently completed the Insanity program and had started P90X and was halfway through it when I found out. Wanted to keep doing P90X but my energy level wouldn't let me. I bought this DVD hoping to get a good Cardio workout and it's not compared to what I had been doing but for someone who hasn't been doing anything and wants to start for a healthy pregnancy I think it's great. The strength training is good I think, it left me sore so that's always a good sign to me! The Pilates is good also. Not to intense for core work but still challenging. The Yoga on the other hand is terrible. It's so outdated looking and choppy. Not a smooth flow at all which is something I love about doing yoga. It's not challenging what so ever. I know I'm pregnant and don't need to overdue it but I feel like I haven't done anything after doing the yoga. So I would recommend this DVD for the strength training and the Pilates but that's it!"
2,not very good,"very slow, I found it not even remotely challenging. No flow just broken up segments that start and stop each exercise sequence."
3,UDT frogmen mission,This video concerns a ww2 sub that has been assign to pick upand deliver UDT frogmen to a site of a sunken usn sub that hasadvanced radar which must be selvaged by the Japanese navy. Thetask is to blow up the sunken sub before salvage is done.
2,budgeting for beginners,This is an easy read with good forms but is directed at individuals who have no experience with budgets or other financial planning. Very basic and a good tool for college age or young just married.
1,Family Financial Workbook: A Family Budgeting Guide with CDROM,i brought this product and what was advertise is not what i received. i think it is very bad when you advertise something and then try to say that because it is seconds something is missing... then i think you should advertise what you have. Because of this i had to buy the book again to get what i want.... Try doing business a little better than what you are doing....
1,Terrible Book!!!!,"Do these people live in the ice ages or what. There are some good suggestions and worksheets but this book gave me no soild plan. Ordered another book from him, guess I am out of that money too."
1,Not at all what I hoped for.,"The entire tape plays like a radio show with a lot of talking and very little music. I thought it would be more up beat, playful, and full of songs my child would love. I am entirely disappointed and can't even give this CD to anyone because they don't want it. :("
3,jessi's girls,jessica & seth are newly wed mormon couple and on route by covered wagon from utah territory to arizona. they are hold up by a gang of hoodlums who kill seth and raping jessica. she than avengers her husband death by tracking down the gang who rape and killed her husband .this is do to bad film for a cowboy film and it got 1 rape see in it but you do see a lot of naking womaning
4,Great account of Lt. Colonel North's life and exploits,"I picked this up for 50c at the local shops. I was quite surprised, as this is one of the best books I've ever read concerning Ollie North.It is more than just about his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. It is more of biography of this truly amazing man and his dedication to his country and beliefs.If you can find this book anywhere, I would strongly recommend you get it, even if you are unfamiliar with whom Ollie North is."
4,Works good,"I couldn't find these in the store anymore so glad I could find them here. They don't fit as tight as others- which is good. I was worried at first about ordering through the mail, but they are great."
4,Good buy and features,"Great service from Electronics Expo. - great price and fast delivery. Got this because of selectable image resolution (only with HDMI), matches to Vizio 42 inch LCD, gives great picture especially when used with HDMI (cable much less expensive online than from local stores). Also can use tuner to view TV image live - allows for PIP on TVs with limited inputs/PIP possibilities. Had problem setting up - would not go to Welcome screen and would not respond to remote except for resolution button. Finally found that if unit was unplugged for a couple of minutes and then plugged in again (reboot) that it would work as per manual and without further problems. Is slow to boot when switched on. Operates silently."
4,Great Value!,"We ordered this after our VHS/DVD combo unit broke. We love the unit and the remote navigation is relatively easy to learn. If there is one complaint, it's that the unit takes quite awhile to load the DVD after inserting in the tray. Other than that, no problems."
3,"Great picture quality etc, but takes forever to turn on and off","I've been using this for a few years. The DVD recording feature is something I thought I would use a lot, but it turns out I have not used it much at all. You can record from DVR in real time if there is something you really want to save - but this technology is much better on your computer than in a DVD player/recorder.The fatal flaw with this product is that it takes a VERY long time to turn on or off - 30 seconds or so. This makes everyday viewing of a DVD very tiresome. You can't even open the tray until the whole Welcome turn on procedure is complete. Turning off (Bye Bye) is just as bad.I have this set to upconvert everything to HDMI and it makes DVDs look great on my plasma.Unless you really need the recorder, I would stick to something with a much faster turn on/off time."
1,Nope,Skip this one. Less than 2 years old and the HDMI stopped working. It also claims DVD's are 'BAD' about 90% of the time when they play just fine in my older dvd/vcr combo machine. Video was nice when it worked. The person claimed that 'could finish dinner while waiting for the tray to open' is right - and you could add 'I could cook dinner while waiting for it to determine that my dvd is bad.'
4,Worth the price,"Cons: slow in start up, shutting down. Pros: reliable, high quality recording and is the alternative to paying monthly charges to cable companies and Tivo. Overall, great product."
1,Lasted only 6 months,I've barely had this unit 6 months and now all of a sudden it doesn't recognize any new disks for recording !
1,Piece of Garbage,"I'm very surprise as to how poorly this prodcut was made. Picture quality is horrible, especially when it's an upconvert player to 1080. When I switch the 480 to 1080, almost no difference. The response time is unreal, I can finish dinner before the tray opens. The recording feature is horrible, sometime it accepts disc, but most of the time it has the bad error. Waste of money"
4,Disappointed,The setup is less than what is should be. There is no memory of the last input setting. To record the input has to be set every time. Not great.
3,Hm...,"This game was probably good back when it came out back in 2000, but it just doesn't stand the test of time anymore. Plus, you can find it most places for around $9.99 in a bargain bin. While still fun to play, it has no decent soundtrack to speak of, graphics are mediocre compared to today's standards, and levels are not lavish by any means. But, if you're just looking for a cheap, fun, BMX/Freestyle related game to pass the time, look no further than GT's Extreme Freestyle BMX."
5,If you don't know Billy Collins...,"...you should. There is no better way to get acquainted to America's greatest living poet than with this recording. Some funny, some sad and all with a unique observational touch."
5,Billy Collins: Long may he live!,"If you can get past an idiotic short introduction by Bill Murray, you'll enjoy a wonderful experience. Billy Collins has created true poetry that will make you think and laugh."
5,worth the effort,"I heard Billy Collins speak in Wellington early one chilly Sunday morning. He commented that he was amazed anyone would want to get out of bed and listen to him on such a cold day ...he wouldn't! Of course we all thought it worth the effort, nothing beats hearing a really superb poet reading his own work superbly.I heartily recommend this cd, it's always in the most played pile near my cd player and on my ipod,so that I can listen to him any time.A great selection of his work and interesting pre-ambles before each poem."
2,Disappointing,"Was hoping for a halloween type video for my toddler. The second half was more what I thought it would be, but the first half had almost nothing to do with ""spooky"". A lot of it was aimed at not being scared of things. The music was pretty annoying. There was also a scene where a parent asks the child to explain the weird noises they heard coming from her room (she's got a monster friend hidden in the closet). The girl very gibly & without hesitation lies to her parents. That's the end of it. No consequences or anything about it being bad to lie. I don't really like that message being sent to my kids. I'm glad I bought this used & didn't spend very much on it."
2,Sting broke on 1st day,"My son spent his own money on this yo-yo. $32.50 for an 8 year old is alot of money. He received it on Saturday afternoon, by Saturday night the string was broken already and he was so upset. It was so sad. I wish they sent extra strings with the yo-yo"
4,Cat entertainment,"Ok, so my primary reason for getting another yo-yo is to entertain the cats. They love the thing. And I learned to do a bunch of yo-yo tricks.I really wish I could have chosen the colour, though. I got a fairly boring blue.Other than that - it's a nice fast and heavy yo-yo. Do NOT try doing any tricks with it that can result with being hit in the face. This thing hurts like hell if you pull it back up too fast. It can happily come back from sleep after being batted around by cats a few times, though."
3,"For the price, a decent yoyo","Ball-bearing & axle seem sturdy, but the friction mechanism is just some plastic ridges by the bearing. For the price, not a bad yoyo. If you are just starting to learn off-string, it might be OK, but this yoyo will quickly become unresponsive.The yoyo handles being dropped well & doesn't get marks/gouges very easily. It also doesn't seem to hurt our wood floors. It also doesn't seem to leave any marks if it accidentally brushes a wall or two."
2,Fun but not durable,"I was so excited to receive this for Christmas but when I took it out of the plastic and played with it for not even an hour, the string broke. Not very durable, also it doesn't sleep which was disappointing. Fun but not for doing tricks etc."
1,wow,ok so i bought this yoyo thinking it was gana be cool but after 3 sleeps it unscrewed and the barrings went everywhere nd i couldint find em. so now i have a yoyo i cnt realy use. idk if they all come unscrewed a lot but mine sucked.
4,Fun!,"Great for beginners that want to move to the next level. Great for tricks! Winding up can be challenging because of the ball bearing spinner, but once you figure it out it won't bother you."
3,Good yoyo,This is a decent yoyo It's pretty good for doing around the world and sleeps for about 45 sec.tops The good thing about it is that it cant get scratched because it's rubber but it does get dirty.
4,yo-yo boys,"i don't know who had more fun with this yo-yo, my 4-yr-old grandson or his 34 yr-old-father! thanks for getting it there on time."
3,Yomega Xodus II,Overall a good yoyo. However the winding can get the string caught a lot. It has a sleep time from 15-20 seconds. It seems that the rubber outside hurts when it hits your hand. Good for most string tricks. The easiest trick on this yoyo is the elevator. I mean if you want a decent yoyo get the Xodus II but dont be surprised if your hand gets bruises.
4,Creative and disturbing,"I'm thankful to have some translations of this amazing writer of Japanese fiction. These stories provide a rich and surreal reflection on gender and cultural identities and the final story is one of the best depictions of feeling out of place, whether living with a new family or in a new country (in this case both). Sorry to see that this is out of print, but happy that ""Where Europe Begins"" is now out."
3,Hmmmmmmmmmm,This is a surreal book that children will love. If you like bum liking dogs this is the book for you. If you like stories about snot. This is the book for you. It`s a short story filled with dirty and unusual behavior. I must say I have never read anything like it. Read this book. It`s great.
5,Slow Gherkin: The best american ska band & why.,"I tell you why. MELODY & AMAZING FLOW. For a ska band these days that's rarirty. To me Slow Gherkin plays a 90's updated version of ska in the way a 90's updated version of ska should be played. I know them personally & for them the tempo is tight, the melody is king & energy is god. I would definately agree with Alternative Press's review of this CD being ""the best ska album of '98"". I hate ska bands but i love Slow Gherkin."
2,Radio doesn't stay tuned,"We like everything about this AM/FM alarm clock w/CD player EXCEPT the radio does not stayed tuned to the channel you are listening to. This is a real problem, and causes us to be dissatisfied with this product overall. Is there anything that can be done to fix this problem?"
1,"It might have been a lemon, but...","Nothing but the alarm clock part even worked. The CD player never worked and the phone was constantly changing channels making horrible sounds from static to ear piercing squeaks. The concept was great, but the quality was so poor I'm not even risking an exchange to see if it was a lemon."
4,This clock radio/cd player works well.,"I was looking for a Clock radio/phone, with a battery backup and caller ID; and this one works well. It was also inexpensive."
4,"Discontinued Item, would be great if someone else comes up with the same idea (improved though....)","Excelent idea. Looks great and has good sound to play music in any of the features it has.Radio stays tuned well, CD has not had problems after close to 3 years of use.Dual alarm easy to use and program. Wonderfull snooze feature and alarm loud enough to get anybody up.The phone unit looks good, descent range (even with thick walls)and very handy but the Display died slowly after 6 months. Still works fine but you loose all the features that should be displayed (Called ID, battery, time, etc...)Coby doesn't have a department to help you with replacing the part.The sound of the earpiece is really bad, very hard to understand when in a phone conversation and cranking up the volume doesn't help, it just distorts the sound worse.I still keep it for the alarm and radio/CD features. I would love to replace the phone unit."
4,Pretty nice product,"I bought this product for my mom for Christmas. She has not been using it long but is very happy with it. The display could be a little larger for it but, to be honest, the display is larger than what it appears on the web. She is very happy with it. There are not many options out there for this type of functionality."
2,A Big Cinematic Disappointment,"A mad artist can't separate fantasy from reality and takes us on a 106 minute, sleep-inducing journey through his own illusions, which include a vision of a girl who died twenty years ago in an Italian villa. Cinematic chloroform from what should have been a fascinating film. Had the music not been so frightfully avant-garde, I might have enjoyed this a little more. I got the point that the music reflected his inner turmoil, but it was just a bit too noisy and chaotic for me. Also, his imitation of a three year old who can't keep the same train of though for more than five minutes de-railed my interest in the story. Vanessa Redgrave, especially, and the rest of the cast give fine performances, but the movie just didn't work for me. This film was a real disappointment and I kept thinking what Mario Bava could have done with material like this!"
2,"A lot of ""Live"" music and also symphony music! :(","So, this CD was a real disappointment. Many of the tracks are ""Live"" versions and several tracks are nothing more than music performed by a symphony. Cool cover but that's it folks. Amazon has a lot of other collections that have all the original music by Jan and Dean and are far less expensive."
1,Beautiful?,"From where? Defenitely not her, or her music. This artist has a poor sound. Buy something else. Its not worth considering."
1,Please!,"Please remove this artist to a far far place. I hate her voice. It is very annoying. I am going to be honest, Graciela is sort of a friend of mine, but the girl can't sing. Sorry Graciela, but those implants you secretly got (you know where),..they ain't working for you either. Now they don't match your ugly face and flat shapeless body. This CD is not good at all! Everybody-SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A RAINY DAY...or for better CDs!And Graciela...you know who I am!"
3,I still have not received it,"I acn not give a fair rate until I don't receive it. It's over a month now, let's see when do I get it."
2,"Well designed game, boring by nature","What would your kids rather have, a gold fish or a puppy? Most children would prefer the latter.This game is well designed - good graphics and a lot of customization. But the thing is, is that fish are simple not fun pets! Therefore, taking care of virtual fish is quite boring.On one hand, this is as fun as taking care of fish gets - unlimited customization with an unlimited budget."
1,No Registration Code - So Cannot Load Game,"When we opened our Sim Aquarium, there is just the disc in a jewel case, with a label on the back of the jewel case that states ""My Sim Aqua Reg Code"" ""TYPE YOUR NUMBER HERE"" and then a seven number long hyphenated number. The problem is, the code does not work in the Install program, in any combination of captials, zeros, ""o""s, hyphens, underscores, or any how. We cannot get past the Install Shield first screen. There is No Manual in the box with the disc; the manual is on the disc, which we cannot access without the code number. Soooooo, I have a disc that is un-playable and an extremely disappointed 9-year-old, and I am out the cost of the game. Hope you have better luck!"
2,Realistic but Boring,"I bought this to unwind after stressful days. Fish, watching them swim should be a perfect way of unwinding, but not through this program.It is very realistic, the fish, the plants and other elements you can add to make your own marine aquarium.The trouble is it doesn't offer much besides buying the fish and choosing ornaments and placing them wherever you like. It would be nice as a screensaver, but not much else.I also have problems on my computer since installing it. I can't get straight to the internet without first having this pop up.It's monotonous and boring. I can't really use it for more than five minutes without getting bored.I can't recommend this."
2,"Unchallenging, slow paced game.","Nice enough looking fish and water habitats, but the game is unchallenging and therefore probably not all that interesting to most adult players. There are also no instructions (from what I could tell). You kind of have to figure it out yourself, which isn't hard, but I still would have liked clearer objectives to the game. I also couldn't figure out how to make the aquarium my screensaver, as it says you can on the box.I much prefer ""Fish Tycoon"" (Activision), where you have to earn the money to buy supplies, and you can sell fish you breed and discover new species."
2,Worst among its peers,"I would say the quality of coverage is pretty poor. The articles are recycled from those which have already appeared on the web at [...]. Quite a large volume of the magazine is devoted to the advertisements, so much so, it feels as though articles are inundated with adverts. I would say that the articles are mediocre compared to magazines like BusinessWeek and The Economist.I am not renewing my subscription."
3,Crisis in Identity,"Fortune magazine appears to be encountering a crisis in identity and focus. Between all the business magazines Fortune does not stand out from the crowd as a quality publication. Depending on your needs, I would recommend other magazines that are more attuned to the needs of business leaders.Forbes: Conservative viewpointBusiness week: Quick summary of the weeks eventsEconomist: Excellent reporting, more neutral point of view"
4,"Good Articles, Different Perspective Than Forbes","It's a good magazine, with a blend of different stories. Doesn't come across as preachy as Forbes. A decent amount of tech industry content too."
4,Great Magazine,Great Magazine that covers the main points of the top 500 companies. This is a great magazine if your looking to keep up to date on the larger movement of the economy. This magazine comes at a great value and the stories they produce show usually the general movement of the market. Well worth read if applied right for beginning investor. I enjoy the special interest articles on CEOs making a difference and I think could be written about more often.
2,The magazine is fine - S&H is taking forever!,"I got this subscription for my husband on Oct. 22, 2012 and stil have not gotten one issue! It says he should have his first by 1/8/13. Over 12 weeks! Way too long for the first issue to be sent out! Very disappointed!"
2,"Articles of Interest, But Flawed Investment Advice","To be honest, none of the big business/investing rags seem to do a very good job with a crystal ball. So I would caution Fortune readers - read for interest, read for fun, but don't bet your savings on ""Best Picks for 2012"" headlines. As a for instance, while the S&P 500 was up 15.1% in 2010, the Fortune ""10 Best Stocks for 2010"" returned 2.2%. Great headline, poor advice! For more on the big investing magazines predictions vs performance, check out the Ric Edelman article -[...]"
2,What happened??,"I have been a loyal Fortune reader for almost 20 years. It was my favorite magazine and I looked forward to every issue.Over the past year+, it has been tired with little innovation and less of the depth it used to have. What happened?? I admired Andy Serwer until he became editor. Is it the invrstment or the staff?"
2,I could have written better myself,"I went from frustration to laughing at how predictable the story was. I bought it because it was set in Cyprus but it may as well have been set anywhere with a bit of coastline, mythology and Indiana Jones-ish conditions. The central character was so weak and it was confusing that all of these business-man type characters kept coming in and out of the story with little character development. The two female characters were such stereotypes, it was disappointing really. The basic story wasn't too bad, it could have been spiced up a little and written to entertain rather than narrate. Then the book could have been improved greatly. Maybe it did work better as a TV show."
5,Magic in 128 Pages,"I first came across Rose is Rose in my local newspaper. After the first strip, I was hooked. This book is a great compilation of many classic Sunday Rose is Rose comics done in beautiful full color. This is a great read when you're feeling down, because the love contained in the book almost jumps right at you and envelops you. Although that may sound a bit sappy, there very little doubt that after you read this book, you'll have as big a smile as Pasquale does in the book. If you're a Rose is Rose fan, or even if you've never seen this comic before, it's a great buy."
4,Better then the Comics,"This book was better then expected, has comic strips of all the characters and something for everyone. I was really happy with my purchase and thought, Wow! when does the next book come out."
5,Just read it!,"This book is a great romance read! It reminds me a little of my favorite Kathleen Eagle book, The Night Remembers. Be prepared to put your life on hold until this one is finished!"
4,portfolio,"Nice portfolio. Would have liked to have had a side loop for the pen. I bought a tan portfolio a couple of weeks earlier, and it had the pen loop. The black one did not. You have to put a pen in the inside center slot. This makes it difficult to close, and you need a very slim pen."
4,"Love this case, had it for almost a year!","I have a Purple Metallic Clie PEG-N610C. THis case fits PERFECTLY for my clie and I can still access jog dial, serial sync and home/car charging, as well as accessing stylus and memory card slot. I have had this case for about 8-10 months and I love it. It has wonderfully protected like no other case I have had. It rolls around in my laptop bag and my purse. I can tell how great it works by the scratches and dings on the case- without it, those scratches and dings would be on my clie. The only downfall is that the case does scratch and nick. It would be 5 stars if there was a better finish on the case to protect it from me! You also can't sync with the clie in the case (if you are using a cradle) but you can easily remove the clie or use a serial cable."
1,CRAP!,The documentation CLEARLY states it will fit the 710 clie. IT DOES NOT! IT IS NOT ALL ALUMINUM as advertised either. Piece of crap. Sending back.
4,Now language is policed,Millionaire in 365 Days: The Daily Plan to Get ThereYour kids do not have a chance to get anything that may be the truth until it is filtered to suit all kinds of activists agendas.Do they know facts or a fictional agenda...you decide...it looks like they are getting a lot of bull....and then they start to believe it....
4,The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn,"(Special interest groups) are sucking the life out of the heart of America and Diane Ravitch explains what is happening and why. I really enjoyed (reading this book), although what it revealed tended to <frustrate> me."
1,If only....,"Having worked in educational publishing, I looked forward to what I expected to be a probing look at how various pressure groups affect textbooks and curriculum. Instead I read a poorly researched report that does not really ask the hard questions about its subject.If this was supposed to be a tabloid expose, I am surprised Ravitch could not find more extreme cases. If she wanted a more serious look at how pressure groups affect education, she failed there as a well by speaking anecdotally and ignoring larger trends.At times, Ravitch lets her own political bias influence what she reports, giving much space to ""left-wing"" pressures on history textbooks, while ignoring the even stronger ""right-wing"" pressure.If you want a superficial examination of serious problems, then this is the book for you.It is not for me."
4,Makes you wonder,"Really good points made throughtout the book. Many parents believe schools, or districts, set the curriculum. In reality, the schools are the tail end of a trickle down process that begins with some very small special interest groups. The power of these groups defies logical reasoning. In our efforts not to offend anyone, we diminish the very things we stand for."
3,So so book,"Yes, this book brings to light what happens behind the scenes, and the tug-of-war between the left and the right, but it very repetitive throughout."
1,Old News,"Ravitch re-visits a topic James Loewen covered quite well in 1996 with his ""Lies My Teacher Told Me : Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong."" Ravitch tries her best but falls back on left bashing. This is all a been-there-knew-that if you follow education."
1,you have the right to be a right wing whiner!,"how do you plead your case, Ms. Ravitch.Basically, you have the ""i've got mine so screw you"" crowd clothing themselves as victims.It would be one thing of they told the truth.They don't."
5,Excellent Reveiw of a Long Ranch Problem,This book has CLEARLY shown the serious and unbelievable problem we are facing with our children's education.I cannot beleive what is happening in our school systems...What are we creating by letting the FEW dictate to the MANY. We must pay attention and make our voices heard.
4,Eric Sloane Revered American History,"This book is another of the artistic tributes to America's past from a master artist. World-famed for his skies and clouds, Sloane studied the way America came to be what it is - or, perhaps, what we want to see ourselves as - the times and places and things that made the nation.The illustrations are superb; the text inspiring.The vendor deserves some credit, too. That would be Motor_City_Books. The book arrived in better condition than I expected and in a timely fashion. I appreciate that I can do business with vendors linked to Amazon with confidence."
2,cute ideas... measurements are off,"Some of the projects in this book are great ideas, and the patterns look easy.Once i started actually making the projects, i noticed the measurements are way off!I double/triple checked MY measurements, and they follow the book exactly.For example: The diaper cover turns out to be sized for a doll (maybe a premie baby... maybe).. and the bibs end up having 2 inches on either side to tie around the babies neck. I believe they will be easy to remedy-it's just annoying (especially after you have already cut the fabric). Another thing I noticed, is the suggested iron on vinyl, for water-profing the material, has to be ironed every time it is washed. I, personally, dont know anyone who irons their babies clothes-or has the time!I wont return the book, because the patterns/ideas I like... I just need to figure out the proper measurements."
3,Pretty Table Book,"This is a nice book to display on a table, but other than that the gifts they suggest are hardly practical or something someone would use. I would not recommend this book."
3,The Complete Walking with Dinosaurs Collection,"Thanks, my kid loves the ""Rowrs""...... but I'm sick of the Limey / British narrator already!"
3,The title is a misnomer - 2 specials in the series aren't here,"This review is only to point out that this product is not in fact ""The Complete Walking With... Collection."" It has only 3 of the 5 ""walking with"" TV specials - ""Dinosaurs,"" ""Allosaurus,"" and ""Prehistoric Beasts."" It does not have ""Cavemen"" and ""Life Before Dinosaurs - Walking with Monsters."" To get all 5, you'll need to buyPrehistoric Earth: A Natural History (Before the Dinosaurs: Walking With Monsters / Walking With Dinosaurs / Allosaurus / Walking With Prehistoric Beasts / Walking With Cavemen)."
5,Walking With Collection,Excellent compulation DVD you get both Walking With Dinosaurs and Walking with Beasts. Excellent animatronics telling a story through the ages from the very first dinosaurs to the sabre tooth tiger and man. Highly recommended.
4,Very entertaining,"The whole family liked watching this series of Walking With. If you haven't seen any other dinosaur Walking With, you will greatly enjoy these DVDs. (If you have seen others, then you will see some repeat scenes of other DVD discs) The animation is not quite perfect but realism is good enough. It's four stars only, because it could have been in true wide screen with an aspect ration 1.8:1. the 1.33 means it will fill the screen of old typical TV tubes and easily fills any wide screen TV without any black bars. (hate those black bars)Very good for the family to watch."
5,A brilliant must-have collection!,"Last year 2006, a local channel here in Manila, Philippines aired this series in our local tagalog dialect with local host and titled it ""Hayop Na Hayop (great animals)."" Unfortunately the tv series ended. However, my 6-yr old son Diego Miguel can't get enough of it and still hopes to catch it again on tv. Good thing I searched this title here at Amazon and upon reading the great reviews decided to do my first purchase in Amazon!I am so excited when it arrived (well upon paying almost the same amount of duties and taxes here) and surprised my son with this box collection!He was so happy!!!Now the whole family is enjoying this brilliant collection! I highly recommend WALKING WITH DINOSAUR COLLECTION to everyone!!!Thanks Amazon!"
5,Grandson Loved This.,"The ""live"" Walking with Dinosaurs came to our area so I purchased tickets for the grandson and family to go see. He loved it. So when I saw this DVD collection from the TV show I purchased as a Christmas gift."
1,Don't Bother,I bought this CD from a Thift Store here in town. I got home and played it. The songs they claim was orginal wasn't. I didn't have a great experince with the CD. I was very dissapoint.
4,Nice to hear from the folks we listen to,"I got this cd for free, but I'd pay $2 for it as i see it listed on amazon. It's hearing your favourite artists actually talking, instead of singing. Unlike secular artists or hollywood empty heads they have something to say worth listening to.. they are just regular folks letting God use them to reach you..."
5,Works well,Im almost 28 and have been having breast pain that has gotten increasingly worse over the months and would last all month. Since I have been using this cream for the past two weeks I have not had any breast pain. Im guessing that my progesterone must have been too low. I also had some bad insomnia over the past year and I have been sleeping really well lately. It seems to me that the cream is helping me.I have also quit caffeine completely in addition to using this cream.
2,Not for me,"Had a bad reaction. Feet swelled, headache...just me I guess but I threw it away. Others may find a different result."
2,dangerous,"This product should never be used without the recommendation of a physician. Applying this product topically presents two very significant problems: 1) The areas you apply it to become over-saturated quickly, which can cause a host of new problems, and 2) the cream rubs off on your clothing and bedding and also stays on your hands after application. Inevitably, it gets on others in your household, eventually entering the blood stream of those you live with including your husband, your children, and your pets. The trace amounts are unlikely to cause any deleterious effects, but if you use this cream as often as the instructions recommend, you are exceeding trace amounts for those around you.Internal methods of delivery are much safer, but again, no matter how you choose to address your peri-menopausal or menopausal challenges, consult a doctor before ordering anything."
1,Not a Substitute for Progesterone,"I purchased this to supplement my progesterone because I was experiencing estrogen dominance that is common in premenopausal women. My periods would seem to stop, then start again with bleeding and spotting for 10 days or more. This cream had NO EFFECT and did not shorten or change my cycles, even though I used 2-3 times more than indicated. If you need progesterone, get to a doctor and get some. This cream will not do the trick."
1,Not sure this is the real thing,"I have purchased this before directly from the store. Unless the formula has changed this is not the real Emerita cream. There is a fragrance with the real stuff that is not present in the tube I received from this seller and it also has not been ""helpful"" in the way that my store bought bottle was.Maybe I am crazy, but it seems just not right."
5,It Works ! Magic!,"... at 52-1/2 lost period, lost libido and started having minor heat flashes. One night in the middle of the hot flush I remembered a book I read 20 years ago: ""What your doctor did not tell you about your menapause"" and it was still on my book shelf. Went directly to the back of the book where a listing of all the brands of cream which actually work were. A week later via Amazon started using this pre-measured product. Within 2 weeks no more Hot Flushes, libido is back and I also noticed the changes in my skin tone (nice add-on). Although my period returned for at least the last 3 months of use, I love the cream. It has no smell and in pre-measured form it is super easy to use. Thanks Emerita - I am your fan!"
5,Progestrone cream,"In california this stuff is banned,cancer causing, another source says all wild yam progesterone is ineffective. Who's telling the truth? All I know is that since I've been using this I sleep better, sweat less and generally feel better. I am 63 yrs old,used estrogen for years then quit due to possible heart/stroke complications. What to do? Nothing and misery for 4 yrs till I found this cream. Is it harmful? I don't know but I'm going to keep using it"
5,Great product at an awesome price,"I've used Pro-Gest off and on for years since my TAHBSO in 1997 for endometriosis. Not being able to take any estrogen for six months post surgery, I used Pro-Gest when I started getting hot flashes and night sweats, within two weeks they were completely gone. I needed complete hormone supplementation after removal of uterus, ovaries, tubes and cervix. I used by prescription bioidentical compounded hormones. I tried oral progesterone (wasn't absorbing enough), transdermal progesterone (absorbed too much) so in addition to Bi Estrogen and Testosterone I also now use Pro-Gest so as not to be using unopposed estrogen and for progesterone's other benefits when one has had their ovaries removed. Paraben free and made by an awesome company, Emerita. This is the best price I've found for the 4oz tube."
1,Exercise Caution - Can Cause Side Effects,"Please check the side effects experienced by patients at AskAPatient.com under progesterone before proceeding with using this product. You will see users of both cream and pills and can differentiate by their description and dosage amounts.After six months of using this cream I am discontinuing it due to significant weight gain concentrated in my middle as well as hair loss, both of which seem to be quite common. These symptoms snuck up on me but finally I began to tie it all together..."
4,Progesterone Cream,"Hard to tell if it is ""doing"" anything-- it was recommended to treat ""estrogen dominence"", but I still have symptoms after over 2 months of use. Then again, I don't really have access to lab testing to document hormonal levels, so have no idea what starting or current levels are."
2,I can't tell a difference,"I've been using this for a month now and haven't noticed any difference at all. It might as well be hand lotion as far as I'm concerned. I use a dime sized spot twice a day. Hasn't helped the hot flashes, night sweats, or dryness. I was really hoping that this product was the answer but it doesn't appear so. Kind of bothered me that it says on the tube that if you want to see the ingredients, look on the box. Since I threw the box away when I got it, I couldn't do that. Makes me wonder if it really is progesterone cream..."
3,Progesterone Cream,I'm not sure this cream works. I've used it one or twice but I cannot confirm it made it difference in my condition. I don't think I would purchase it again.
4,satisfaite,produit conforme a ce que j'en attendais. IL hydrate en plus la peaux. par contre le dosage n'est pas évident et mais on sent très vite une différence a l'usage. a fait 2 mois que je l'utilise
1,Emerita,"I was desperate for something to help me with my menopause symptoms. I am 45 years old and am tired of being tired so i purchased this product. I was so excited at this product being delivered. Wow, what a huge disappointment. Smells horrible. Does not absorb quickly and gets on your clothes and just plain does not work. Will go to GNC and purchase their product that comes in a stand up pump dispenser. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY."
5,It helped me get pregnant,"I tried to get pregnant for three years. I tried everything. I even went to a fertility doctor for a month of monitoring and diagnosis, but they found nothing. I only got the idea to take progesterone supplements because the doctor gave them to all patients after they ovulated. They didn't even bother to test me to see if I needed it. The dosage at the office was much higher. I couldnt afford to see the doctor long term. So a few months later, I started using this cream. The very first month I used it, I finally did get pregnant. My OBGYN did a blood test and found that my progesterone levels were still too low even with using this cream. So they switched me to a prescription. Still, my daughter wouldn't be here if I didn't try it. I didn't have any side effects. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to get pregnant with a short luteal phase in their menstrual cycle."
4,great but didn't last,"i get hot flashes every hour every day!! i tried this cream religiouslyand my hot flashes were gone!! but, it was too good to be true. i don'tknow if i became immune to it or why but it stopped working after about 3 mos.it was a nice break though!"
5,The Best,"I have used this product for a number of years and find it to be the best on the market, it has helped me immensely and I wouldn't be without it. It also doesn't hurt that I got the best price through Amazon.com too!"
5,Health life saver,Seems to work a little better than the other brand that I tried. It is saving my life health wise. Night and day difference. Reducing my fatigue by balancing out my estrogen/progesterone levels and therefore raising my thyroid and reduces or eliminates other female health problems. Menopause? Bring it on!
2,"Good product, but not this batch...","My wife has been using this product for several years to good effect, and just ordered her first tube from Amazon due to its great price. Bad move - this batch is staining everything ""Highlighter Yellow"": the bedclothes, her clothes, her skin, etc. It took us almost 2 weeks to determine that it was the Pro-Gest that was the culprit. If you are ordering this from Amazon for the first time, we recommend you try it out first to ensure it doesn't stain. If it does, return it before 30 days are up in order to get a full refund."
4,So far so good,"I've only used this a few times so I can't say much, but it seems to be taking the edge off my PMS- it was delivered just in time! Very mild smell, hardly any. I apply it to my inner arms- bicep to wrist. Hope it gets better and better!"
5,Love this product!,"After one month, this cream put an end to my sleepless nights and jitteriness. What a huge difference it has made for me! And the price is fantastic. I have it automatically delivered every month."
5,just as expected,Simple and easy. It takes the guess work out of progesterone. The little packets are pretty easy to open and not messy at all.
4,Best Progesterone Product,"I've done quite a bit of research and found that this product is often recommended by the health professionals that believe in progesterone supplementation. I am 51 years old and have used it for about a year and I feel better. Not sure if it's the power of suggestion or if this stuff really works, but I'm assuming this stuff really works! Plus, it's paraben free, which is important, and it isn't derived from yam extract. I'm giving it 4 stars since the effectiveness of the product is subjective, and not scientific."
5,Please consider these if you have migaine!,"If you are considereing using this product to combat 'estrogen dominance' induced migraines, you're on the right track! If you're not sure what that is, but suffer from menstrual migraines, it might be very helpful for you to look it up. I noticed a HUGE improvement in several areas after I started using this product: I experience far fewer migraines, I feel much less irritated, my PMS symptoms have diminished, and my memory has improved. I use 1 tube on days 7 to day 14, 2 tubes from day 15 to day 21 and 3 tubes until day 28. This is not exactly what is recommended, but it works for me. (Another note; this is working well for me in combination with the *very* restricted diet recommended in ""Heal Your Headache"" by Dr. Buchholz. Eliminating my migraines has required a multi-level approach). You really can do something to help yourself. I wish everyone who is suffering with migraine the best of luck!"
4,Good Product,Most stores only let you get this with a prescription but you don't always have insurance to get a prescription and this product is hopefully helping me carry a baby to term.
5,Great product,"In perimenopause with lots of uncontrolled emotions, this product evened me out!! May not work for all, but highly recommend giving it a try!"
4,hotflashes almost gone..I love it,I love this product..my hot flashes have diminished by over 70 percent and i love the way I feel...i just have to remember to stop for one week a month
1,Lambs to Slaughter? Why Buy Something That May Cause Cancer?,"I understand the positive reviews posted here are based on immediate results. What about long term? What about cancer?Doesn't that BOTHER any of the people posting that they're using this product? It says right here in the product description and on the box that this product can cause cancer. How is it that women can be manipulated to believe that temporary relief from menopausal symptoms is worth the RISK of cancer or dying from it? I'll keep searching for a natural remedy. Possible side effect, cancer? HELLLLLOOOO!! NO THANKS!If I'm missing something, that someone wants to point out to me....have at it! I'm all ears."
1,Question,I know these are reviews only but I was just wondering if anyone is taking this progesterone cream while on BC. I am on the NuvaRing and don't know if I should stop it or not. I don't want to get pregnant but am wondering if the cream will still be effective?? I have not purchased/used the cream yet. Thanks for your help!
3,Too long ...,"It took almost 4 weeks to arrive in France; it's a long time ! Product, price and packaging OK . I'll order one more time , maybe I'll be luckier !"
1,caused hives,Used product for 15 days. Broke out in hives on areas of the skin I applied the cream to.Unfortunately this did not give me time to even see if I would get any benefits out of it.Very sad :( I had high hopes.
3,stinky,"I bought the single dose packets so I didn't have to deal with measuring, but the packets smell like MAYONNAISE!! All I can think about is how unnatural it must be... so I think i will try buying the tube next time."
1,This product needs a warning,"While I am sure some people feel great on this, I had the worse PMS of my life. I felt good on it the first couple weeks. I then had 1.5 weeks of horrible PMS. Everything was overwhelming -senses and emotions. If people were talking to me, I felt like they were yelling. If someone was standing close, I felt suffocated. In short, I felt like a CRAZY person. It was like some kind of exponential PMS. I even had suicidal thoughts. Seriously, I don't normally feel ANY of this, so it seems like someone less stable than me should not be taking this without some sort of supervision."
2,Not sure,"I'm not really sure this product works like they claim, I really didn't see a difference while using it. Although when I did try it I was having other medical issues."
4,Works pretty well,I'm a 49 year old & with the issues that are associated with perimenopause. Ordered this at the beginning of Sept. Arrived quickly. It adsorbs quickly and the scent doesn't last long. Have been using it according to instructions. I have had some positive results & it has helped with the breast tenderness & night sweats & a little with insomnia. To see if I'm on the right path I believe that I will be changing more of my eating to whole foods & get a hormonal test & integrate more exercise into my life.
2,Tried it...back to Source Naturals!,"I tried this product after finishing up my last tub of the Source Naturals brand of progesterone cream. I was immediately turned off by the smell- it's not all that strong but the synthetic ""sweet wheat"" scent made me nauseous. I persisted and found that I just did not experience anywhere near the benefits/symptom relief that I did when using my usual. I'm glad I gave it a shot but will not repurchase."
1,Not for me....,"Beyond the arguments made in the scientific community concerning the efficacy of this product in regard to progesterone replacement and the cancer warning that some have noted, I was apparently one of the select few - given the reviews here - that has experienced negative side effects. I was hoping that this product would provide a natural option to level out some of my periodic hormonal roller coaster ride days. Unfortunately it raised my blood sugar at such an alarming rate that I had to discontinue after 4 days. Immediate raise upon starting + immediate drop upon discontinuing = no question this was not working to my advantage. This was also accompanied by weight gain and fatigue which were not what I was shooting for. I thought is important to share as I had searched extensively for any guidance on potential side effects and found the info spotty at best in regard to potential impacts on blood sugar. In this case, I am sticking with the professionals to address moving forward."
1,Just Purchased & Box is Different,Just received the box and it is different than the box on Amazon. On my box it's not called Progesterone Cream...it's called balancing cream. On Amazon it says clinically tested for menopause/perimenopause on my box it doesn't say any of that. I also read that even this type of progesterone can cause cancer...if that's the case...I might as well get a prescription from my doctor and save the 20 dollars I paid for this. I'm very wary at this point for the mere fact the box is different. Don't know how it will affect me as of yet (obviously). Any input would be helpful and appreciated.
4,Pro-Gest is OK,Seems to be helping with the dryness. Easy to use and reasonably priced from Amazon versus other sources. Will continue using.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Made my hot flashes worse, way worse. Smells not so good. Throwing out the remaining product. Tried for 21 days."
2,"Not as concentrated as Natpro, and it shows in the results","I bought this and Natpro at the same time to compare. The natpro has been great, the progest...meh. So I checked the ingredients. Progest has 450mg/oz compared to Natpro's 1000mg/oz. So, you may get more cream for your money, but you are getting less progesterone, and you can tell. Plus, the Progest smells like mayonaise. So, expect to use twice as much as you would normally have to use of cream that smells funny and doesn't seem to absorb quite as well as Natpro. ...Or buy Natpro..."
4,works....bad smell,"i'm 28 and i have been using this on and off for awhile now. i have to say it really works. my doc told me i would have to go on birth control to help balance out my hormones, or take the shots. he didn't want to do either and suggested something like this. he was very adiment that birth control and the shots are very bad for your body, but if nothing else works i will have to do it. i went to a health food store and found this and never looked back! i was having severe cramps and nausea along with NO periods constantly. after only a few days i was starting to feel better! it really did work, but it's not the best smelling or feeling. it's not cheap either, but looking at the costs of the RX for the other options (along with the bad affects of them) i will take a crappy smell over that!"
5,Excellent quality Progesterone,This product is of excellent quality and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a progesterone cream to help balance hormones.
5,Emerita Pro-Gest,A great product that helps with menopause symptoms. I can buy it at lower price than my local health food store.
1,Never felt so bad in my life!,"I used this product upon the advice of my ob/gyn after I complained to him about longer periods that are becoming closer together, along with many other bothersome symptoms of perimenopause. I started out with the lowest dose possible and began having anxiety and headaches, so I reduced the dose to the size of a small pea. I tried to tough it out, thinking it was just because my body needed to get used to it. I got worse and worse to the point where I woke up in the middle of the night with a racing heart, and migraine and could not get back to sleep at all, which never happens to me. One day after I stopped this cream, I got a lot better. It was a horrible experience. Please check out askapatient.com and search for progesterone. There are about 300 reviews from other women about ""natural"" progesterone cream. You'll see my experience was one of hundreds of similar nightmares."
2,Looking for relief........,"I was looking for something that would give me relief from the hot flash's that was keeping me up at night etc., a women I work with recommended it so I thought I'd try it and it seemed to maybe help a little but not enough to get me to continue using this product. I'm sure it affect everyone differently but it didn't do a whole lot for me."
2,Not as effective as Arbonne Progesterone for me,"I tried the Emerita Pro-Gest, because I was looking for a less expensive alternative to the Arbonne Phytoprolief Natural Balancing Cream (my doctor recommended Arbonne which I used for 3 months). While the Pro-Gest was about 1/4 of the price, but it didn't seem to help me as much as Arbonne. The Pro-Gest cream was a lot thicker and stickier than the Arbonne, and it was more difficult to work into my skin. It seemed that the Arbonne help mellow out my moody PMS symptoms much better as well (I definitely noticed a difference with the Arbonne when I used it the last 14 days of my cycle). Plus I like the metered dosage pump with the Arbonne. So, I'm back to ArbonneArbonne Phytoprolief Natural Balancing Cream. It was worth a try, but I should've bought the small bottle to make sure it was going to work for me. Good luck!"
5,Recommended by tv docs,"I bought this for my mom who saw it suggested on the television program Dr.Oz (famous for being on Oprah). She recently started using the cream, and she's already noticing improvements. I'll definitely buy her another tube when this one runs out."
5,LifeSaver ;D,I am 46...I have been suffering from low energy...hot flashs..insomnia...bloating...mood swings...irregular cycle and low libido....LET ME TELL YOU...since I found this product and NOW Maca Root 500mg it has been all uphill!! Anyone looking for natural alternatives to HRT should give this a try...dont give up...you need to take at least a month or less to feel results...I am grateful for this product and so is my family!! I am ME AGAIN...woot woot!!
1,Warning: May Cause Cancer,"I was disturbed. I bought this product today based on the recommendations and what do I see on the box ""WARNING: This Product Contains A Chemical Known To The State of California To Cause Cancer."""
2,Not for me,"First time using it was during my last cycle, and first time ever that i started bleeding VERY lightly about 4 days after my period ended and has been steadily going on since. I'm hoping it will end when i'm thru with my next period. Obviously i won't be using this product again."
2,the smell is bad,"I used this during my first trimester and the smell was making me very nauseated. I prefer http://www.amazon.com/Source-Naturals-Progesterone-Cream-Ounce/dp/B000GFHP16/ref=sr_1_5?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1343774953&sr=1-5&keywords=progesterone+cream Source Naturals Progesterone Cream that is two times cheaper, doesn't smell that bad and works just as good."
5,Great decorative furniture,This is exactly what I was looking for and it arrived in a timely fashion. It's perfect for what I needed.
5,Great purchase,I am so pleased with this plant stand. It is just the right size for one of my large indoor plants and displays beautifully. It looks good and the quality seems good. It shows off my plant to its best advantage.
2,"listen to ""Chomp"" instead","I have a few problems with this album. First of all, I love Pylon's other albums, and reasonably expected ""Chain"" to be of equal quality. It isn't. Second, I don't want to completely bash it... for there's a few good songs. Three to be exact. ""Look Alive,"" ""There It Is,"" and ""Sloganistic."" Thirdly... well, it's almost impossible to treat badly. A totally harmless work by what are probably really nice and harmless people. But then again, everyone is harmless and most albums are too. So f**k it. This album sucks (read: is boring). Sorry Vanessa and Co., but I think you guys should of written more memorable material. When I think of this album, I think not of a specific song or two, but of how much it costed me -- two bucks. Brand new, too! C-"
4,"""I've been cleaning my guns a lot this fall.""","That's from the song ""Sick Of It All"". Bill Malonee is a great writer. I saw them perform several times in Athens, Georgia. Bill would get up on stage 1/2 hour before the band, just so he could try out new songs. This is intelligent lyrics with passion and feeling. How many great songs have been written for a first lady? Even though the line up for VOL has changed over the years, their engine remains Bill. Another great lyric that demands individual intrepretation...""Earth has no sorrow, Heaven can't heal"". Words. In the right combination, they can both enlighten or burn, the soul."
1,BORING!!!!,"I was very disappointed with this movie, I liked the idea of it better than the movie itself.. it was very slow .. and it was hard to follow... and there was no plot... if you need help falling to sleep, just pop this one in the vcr, and you will be asleep in no time... YAWN!!!"
3,Good for its ethical dilemma,"This is a pretty decent movie based upon a real life scenario from the 1800s where an American ship captain was tried for manslaughter (not murder) for throwing passengers out of a sinking lifeboat before help arrived. As a teacher I use it for the first day of my Ethics class each semester. The college students get a kick out of it. There's a bit of huffy overacting and some nonsense about a dog who goes overboard, but the scene where the captain orders the old lady to be dumped over the side is brutal, signifying the long string of deaths that are to come, one by one. All in all, its pretty decent fare, challenging the ethics of survival (who is expendable, and who is valuable to survival?) in a most gut wrenching way."
3,abandon ship,"this is a tape of an old time 1950's movie I long awaited for, the tape is in good condtion and the voice is heard to hear I am even goint to buy a new vcr to make sure it is not the vcr machine, only problem with voice too low , otherwise black and white tape in clear good conditon..of an old movie I long awaited to see, just sat up close to hear it.."
2,Abandon Senses!,"I'm sorry, but the great serious issues at the heart of this film are simply swamped by odd and often hilarious acting, reactions, edits and transitions. Like the boat, the participants are wooden and sterotyped. The black man is ""put in his place"" by Tyrone Powers, who shouts him into subserviance; later, he sings a spiritual - no kidding. There's the Italian hood with a switchblade, the officious army commander, the loose woman, the professor, and Mary Ann! No kidding, they are all there, 26 of 'em. Even Tyrone gets the treatment as our conflicted hero. The loose woman gives us the defining aside on Tyrone: ""THERE'S a MAN!""I rated this not zero, or one star - but I gave it two, simply because this is an absolute stitch to watch. It means well, it is so earnest. For that alone it surely deserves notice as a serious hoot.Now, back to bailing..."
2,Innocuous fluff,"I read the Complete Book of Swords just to introduce myself to an older fantasy writer whom I hadn't read before, and I read this one just as a follow-up, perhaps hoping the tale would get better. It didn't. The story is simplistic, with an absolute minimum of characterization. There are a couple of clever moments (e.g. Amintor's desperate gamble while holding Woundhealer), but overall, there's just not much good fantasy ""meat"" here. I might recommend this at a 8th-9th grade reading level, i.e. if someone that age really needed to read a fantasy book. But even then, Alexander's Prydain Chronicles are far superior."
1,"Definitely not a ""goth masterpiece""","Ignore the sexy hype - Has very little to do with sex or the undead. Disappointing compilation consisting mainly of mediocre not-particularly-goth rock songs, often involving a whiny woman with an acoustic guitar--even the kinkiest goth would not find this arousing! The good, actually gothic tracks (e.g. Skeletal Family, Electric Hellfire Club, Nightbreed bands such as Suspiria and Faithful Dawn) can be found on other CDs that are more worth your money. Also a virutal duplicate of other Dressed to Kill sets such as Fangs and Filigree."
1,This book is Pathetic!!!,If you purchase this book you will be paying for the advertizment they are trying to sell you. It tells only negative information on every steroid. It also tries to scare you so your only choice is to buy their natural product they sell that is overpriced. I have the book it burns nice in the fireplace.
5,The last steroid book you will ever need to buy.,The Steroid Bible covers every aspect of steroid use from side effects to using needles. The input from bodybuilders who have used steroids paints an accurate picture of the risks and benefits of steroid use. This book accurately portrays the effects of steroids in a manner that is both informative and unbiased. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!
1,Save your money,"If you have read The World anabolic review, then this book will teach you nothing. After I received this book and flipped through it I realized I wasted my money bigtime."
1,A one phrased book,"The summary of this book limits itself to one phrase: do not use steroids. It does not have guidelines on how to use them, on the contrary, the author keeps presenting arguments to persuade the reader to not even try it, and not in the most objective manner. On the other hand, it provides a chapter describing other alternatives to steroids which I found to be helpful with new information, but overall, the book's title does not honor it's content, and for the quality of the print out and editing you should consider other sources."
1,This book is not a quality steriod information source.,"When I purchased ""The Steriod Bible"" I expected drug profiles that included: what type of effects each individual steriod had, for ex. This particular steroid is used for hardening or cuts, This steriod causes alot of water retention, This steriod is especially harmful to your liver and so on. An individual that is purchasing the steriod bible is not concerned with the recommended medical doses, because the're not sick. They want to know: what the steriod does, what would be the best recommended cycle, pictures of original packaging, so they will not be fooled by fakes, and if this is what your looking for in a steriod book. ""The Steriod Bible"" by Steven Gallaway is not what you want. If there was a zero star rating, I would have selected it."
2,Not a whole Lot,"This book does not deserve its name,most of these info you can get it by surfing the Internet,the only new thing, I found, was the cortisol Subject. It doesn't recommned the quantity, or how to avoid the side effects of the steroids, by using practical way, only in the scientific method.(you must be a doctor to understand what does he talks) Really I consider myself that I lost my money."
1,Big Disappointment!,"I purchased this book to gain some insight into steroids, cycles, and the side effects associated with steroid use. From the very beginning I found the book to be very biased and one-sided. The spelling and grammar was horrible. The book had several miss spelled words and grammatical errors. The book has very little information, which in so many words, strongly suggested that you should not use steroids. It does not contain any facts about specific steroids. Most of the book is just testimonials of people who have supposedly tried steroids. This is the worst book on steroids that I have ever read. The book is written very unprofessionally. This book is a one star rating at best!"
2,"Ok, but needed more","The book had a little information, but in reality it was nothing I didn't already know, so basically it was a waste of my money."
1,Don't buy this book,"Waste of money. All of the information contained in this book can be readily found on the internet. It seems to me like the author didn't want to put anything in the book that might be considered controversial. If you want a better book, buy Anabolic Advantage."
2,A waste of money,This book contains very little useful content. A fair bit of space is wasted discussing legal supplements that were in vogue a long time ago.I didn't find any false information in this book but there are quite a few typos and a general lack of coherency. I'm not at all impressed for the price.
1,Not Worth It,This book is very obsolete. All the information in it is available on the internet. It is not helpful at all for those who have moderate to advanced knowledge on steroids. It is as if the book was thrown together from literature printed off of web sites and research papers.
1,Don't buy it!,"First of all this is a brochure not a book - it's very thin, with lots of blank pages and large fonts.This ""book"" doesn't go beyond very basic information, information which would be easy to find on the Internet.Waste of money!"
1,The Steroid Bible,This is the worst steroid book I have ever read. How he can title it The Steroid Bible I can't figure out. The two best books I have read are World Anabolic Review by P. Grunding / M. Bachmann and Anabolic Reference Guide by Bill Phillips. If you have these two books and read them you will know more about steroid's than most doctors.
2,Not Great,"This book does have quite a bit of information, But you can find much more information on the internet. I was dissapointed when I read this book. The book is a bit pricey for the small amount of information it contains. If you are seriously thinking about using steroids you will be able to find more infomation on the internet, where it doesn't cost a penny."
1,A TOTAL AND COMPLETE JOKE!!!!!!,"I couldn't believe the lack of ""new"" information in this book. There was nothing in there I couldn't (or haven't already) learned reading a magazine like Flex or Musclemag for a couple of months. I was even more offended when at the end of the book there was an ad for some type of muscle building formula that the author was trying to sell as an ""alternative"" to steroids. Give me a break."
1,Not a good buy!,I have to say I was really disapointed with this book! It looks like a high school student put it together and the information is basically common knowledge. You can find everything in this book online easily! Do yourself a favor and save your money!
1,VERY POOR INFO,"i READ THIS BOOK AFTER READING A REFERENCE GUIDE DATED IN 1991. i WAS EXPECTING NEW INFO OR AT LEAST GOOD DRUG PROFILES AND CYCLES. I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED. THIS BOOK HAD LITTLE AND VERY POOR DRUG PROFILES AND NO CYCLE INFO. THIS IS PRETTY MUCH JUST AN OPINIONATED BOOK, AND AGAIN I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED."
5,Steroid Bible,The Steroid Bible is a book which contains alot of factual information about the correct uses of steroids and how to get steroids legally. It is a no nonsense book which I would recommend to any serious bodybuilder. It has helped me in becoming the NSW state champion body builder for my age group.
5,Tells it Like it is,"The good, the bad, and the ugly issues surrounding steroid use are all here. If you want straight to the point, honest, accurate steroid information, this is your source. Other steroid books that I have read make it seem like taking steroids is no different from using creatine. The Steroid Bible tells it like it is and provides extremely useful information about the powerful drugs that are steroids."
1,Advise you to not spend your money on this book,"This book is a compilation of stuff that is readily available on the net. There is not any new, groundbreaking or special advice contained within.I feel that anyone with internet access could have written this book within just a few days."
1,weak source of information,"First of all the book is poor quality, comes in a ring binderform like a ... pamphlet. And it is hardly a bible. Has no information on steroid stacks. It does refer to tapering but never discusses the use of hcg, nolvadex, clomid etc. to counter the side effect of ganadotrophy. It lists some steroids on the market but does not even cover Susteneon and offers little information about them. I learned vitually nothing from this book that I hadn't learned on the internet already."
5,Gave me the safe perspective on how to use steroids,"The user experiences in this book made it more than worth my time and money. It gave me a perspective on steroids that I could not get anywhere else. I'm a first time user and if I hadn't read this book I probably would have bought D-bol, way too powerfull instead of Deca. An example would be their recomendation of getting a doctor to monitor you, I probably would of just done it on my own in fear of getting busted. Instead of just giving you one author's opinion, this book shows a picture of the steroid world by providing detailed first hand accounts of steroid use. The info on side effects, how people get steroids."
1,Not good.,"Not a very good ""book"" at all.So called information is about as minimal as you can possibly get.May be helpful if you know absolutely nothing on the subject.Disorganized. Can get MUCH better books on the subject.Read the other bad reviews, they say it all."
1,don't buy this book if you,"don't buy this book if you are loking for info on gear, it is a waste of money. the book is one long scare tactic and then an ad for his better then drugs all natural alternative."
2,Almost Worthless,"First of all, this is a cheap spiral bound book that looks like a pamphlet printed on a laser printer. There are no pictures or diagrams, and no headings or even bold font used anywhere. So it's like reading someone's thesis. At the end are a bunch of user experiences that all sound like they are from very young, totally inexperienced idiots.It's moderately interesting, but more like a casual conversation you'd have at a cocktail party -- I just read the whole thing in an hour. I did, however, like his take on the reasons to legalize steroids and drugs in general. But again, that is a typical cocktail conversation.But for [this price]... FORGET IT.I actually ordered the wrong book -- I meant to get Anabolics 2002, which my friend said was fantastic, comprehensive, and very current. I'm sending this back and ordering that now."
5,ferking amazing belt,i love the belt it fits well and the design is amazing the only problem is that inky ended up being under the buckle
5,Buy This!,"This album came out in 2004, and when people ask me to recommend my top 10 albums of the year, I forget that this came out 3 years ago and tell them to go buy this. If you don't have this in your collection, go get it. There's not a track that I don't bang. And it seems like I'm always finding something new in it that just makes me go ""Ohhhh!"" This is a fantastic album."
4,WORTH PICKING UP!!!,"I have been a De La Soul fan since the early 90's. They are a strong positive group that has been out for 15 years. Not a lot of rap groups can accomplished what they have done so far. This album is pretty good w positive messages but still get down w hip hop. The song ""Church"" is tight. I love conscious rappers who you have to listen and learn from. Thank you De La for keeping it real and not changing your style. The Bionix album was tight too. Worth picking up. Cop it!!!!!!!!"
5,Finally! Something worth listening to.,"Alright maybe I'm over reacting a little but since the pete rock and madvillain albums, this is the only thing good I have heard. I love De La. They will never change there style and thats what we need nowadays. Same style with diffrent themes and beats mixed in. You can change and be creative but still be the same...Just look at Gang Starr. This is just what Hip Hop needed."
5,Very Good New Album De La...... GRATULATION!!,1. Future - 42. Verbal Clap - 4.53. Much More - 4.54. Shopping Bags (She Got from You) - 55. Grind Date - 56. Church - 4.57. It's Like That - 48. He Comes - 59. Days of Our Lives - 4.510. Come on Down - 511. No - 412. Rock Co.Kane Flow - 513. Shoomp - 3.5Lyrics - 4/5Production - 5/5
2,they had there time,De La Soul ain't counted to me since the early 90's. production&there Flow ain't never changed much&that lies the Problem. never got any growth from them.despite the Guest Artists nothing can Improve this set. there are no knock out cuts but more or less alright material that gets them by on a whole.
2,Overhyped and Overrated,"This album should be called the -Grind Average-. As a huge De La fan I was hyped about this lp but it was a real dissapointment. I believe that there are only a few stellar tracks on this disc and they aren't presenting any real positive messages or anything that I haven't heard before. The featured artists are also pretty wack besides my man common. If you want to pick up a dope album that has been dropped in the past few months, snatch up the Beasties b/c they are the REAL oldschoolers still holdin' it down."
5,Pick up The Grind Date,"The true authors of hip hop De La released their long awaited new album ""The Grind Date"" this joint is so hot you need a roach. I expected the two songs I had already heard before this album dropped to be good (Much More, and Shopping Bags). But I didn't expect every song on the whole album to be this fresh. I love how De La lives outside of the trends just doing what they think is dope and not followin the leader like most of the stuff on the radio. The first track is off the chain ""The Future"", starts off slow but then it blows up, sick beat. Verbal Clap, Much More, Shopping Bags, The Grind Date and the rest of the album is off the hook, you will need a clean pair of shorts when you're done listening to this album. De La Soul, the true authors of hip hop, make DMX, Ludacris, and Jadakiss sound like elementary daycare MC's. Get this album, it better go triple platinum."
3,Only so-so,"This is not as outstanding as the other Magic School Bus games. This is more click and point with static lessons that the child can read. Not much in the interactive area for my 5 year old. He loves most of the other Magic School Bus games, and does not mind this one but it is not one that he is attached to- and he loves learning about the solar system."
5,review,"I found these essays, which address the day-to-day rules for writing a play, filled with such deep and comfortable wisdom that they can easily and usefully be taken as addressing the rules for living a good life as well. They will inform any class of young playwrights with wonderful insight into the theater; but they'll also make for a nice evening of pure pleasure in the company a warm, smart, sensible, humorous writer--whose own story of how she became a playwright is nothing short of inspiring."
3,Actually not that gripping,"Unsworth is a fabulous, I would nominate After Hannibal as my favourite, and I was hoping this would be a serious contender to that title. it really wasn't.the main problem I felt it lacked was that none of the characters were particularly likeable - it's very difficult to sustain interest in a book when you don't actually care what happens to anyone contained in it.however as noted by the other reviewers, it gives you a remarkable sense of place, which is an amazing talent of Unsworth. His books are set in italy, in greece, on tiny islands in the Med, in turkey and each time you can imagine he must have a particular affinity with the place to portray it so well.usually he just tends to like his characters a little more. which at least helps when the plot unravels hopelessly at the end you find you no longer really cared."
3,Great -- if you're not running Windows XP,"I read the reviews that said if you love audio, buy the Intel. So I did.Well, if your computer is running Windows XP don't waste your time--Intel doesn't have drivers for it at this time, and Intel support said they wouldn't until after October 2001. So I got a Roxio 800 instead.While it's that true that the Intel is louder, the sound quality of the Intel isn't head-and-shoulders above the competition like I've read in other reviews.The Roxio has a voice recorder, the Intel has an FM tuner. I don't think I'd ever use either. The main difference I noticed is that the Roxio's fast-forward is better--the Intel ff's at 5-sec intervals, playing a bite of the song in between. Very irritating--the Rio behaves like any other ff.Roxio definitely has the better value, and worked out of the box with Windows XP."
1,Poor customer service,Stay away the product.... the headset connector is lousy. it is not compatible with MS winddows player. Poor manufacturing quality. Lousy customer support. I own also Iomega hip player. not worth the money against Iomega products.
2,Broke within the first week,"Despite the cumbersome software, thought it was great- until it broke after only one week. So far, Intel customer service has been helpful and because they have no more players in stock, are working on getting me a refund. I may even purchase a second player with the cash- can't find a comparable product on the market."
4,a solid player...,"At the time I bought this, it was the only player on the market of such small stature that had 128MB capacity. Others with that capacity were as large as portable CD players, which defeats much of the purpose for owning one of these bad boys. The earphones that came with the player are horrendous. They wrench back on your ears, making for a painful experience. Be prepared to purchase a separate set of earphones. But, as for the player, it is compact, the sound is very good (i know some criticize the dull hissing sound, but you only hear that at very low volumes on quiet tracks), and stylish. I've had the player for about a year and LOVE IT!"
5,It's well worth the expense...,"I made the mistake of messing around with a rio 800 for too long and after my third replacement went out I decided to shell out the extra cash for an Intel Pocket Concert. I've never been happier with an mp3 player. I've used the original rio mp3 player, the 600 and the 800 with various memmory sizes, and none of them are even close to this gem. Software and support from INTEL is readily available, which is another advantage over Rio where I routinely waited for 1 to 3 months for replies. The sound quality and durability of Pocket Concert truly outclass any other MP3 player that I have owned. So if you are looking for a hassle free, clear-sounding, durable product shell out the extra cash and get the intel while you still can."
2,Really bummed!,"I had this player for a couple of months (4) when the headphone jack went out on me. Intel gladly returned it. One year later, the exact same thing happened. Even tho the warranty had expired, I felt this was a major ""flaw"" and they should help me out. I called customer support and because they no longer make these, there is no support. I LOVED the thing while it worked..."
2,Great product with a fatal flaw,"In every regard but one this is the best player on the market. Sound quality and volume, product design, firmware and software are all excellent.The flimsy earphone jack has broken on 2 units I have owned - rendering the player completely useless. The sealed case makes repair impossible."
2,software drivers,"Just purchased this device on Feb 9,2001. Unable to use as the software provided doesn't have drivers for XP Operating sytem. Unable to download from website and told that not available on CD. Apparently my DSL line preventing this somehow. I haven't had this happen with any other website. I am now trying to get a friend to download and send them to me in an email. Intel help desk said this would work. Somehow this seems to leave a lot to be desired. The device works fine and one day soon I'll get to use all of it."
2,Intel Still Needs Work,"Long story short. The amp began clipping at all levels 60 days after purchase. Customer service was impossible to get in touch with and was grossly unhelpful even when you found a living person. Returned for replacement and it will be 30 days before I get another. This is added to the fact that Intel keeps attempting to disclaim my valid rebate.Ultimately, this is a very sad product. Technically, it is wonderfully designed with first rate sound. Alas, poor build quality and a customer service department manned by people woefully inadequate for the task, doom this product. Intel is not ready to deal directly with consumers yet."
4,Intel Quality,"Having used many different MP3 players I can honestly say this unit is of high quality, and is very easy to use. The audio manger software is straight forward and very few clicks are needed to get the music into the player. There is no comparison between the Intel and Rio800. The Rio is pure junk and advise anybody to stay far far away. If you are undecided just read the reviews on the Rio800 -I can vouch for them firsthand! Go with the Intel or Archos Jukebox."
1,Not a product for active users...,"I purchased this item a little over a year ago and, while I was satisfied with it's performance when it worked, I have been thoroughly disappointed by the fact that it has had to be replaced FIVE TIMES.I only use the product while running and it seems that it can't hold up to being jostled around at all. It works for a few runs, but eventually the program freezes. Once you get the ""Player error"" screen of death, there's no hope and the player has to be returned.Luckily, Intel has fessed up to the problem and is refunding me in full despite the lag since I purchased it. I just wanted to let any unsuspecting consumers out there know that while it's great if you want to listen while you're sitting still, it's not a product for active users."
4,Enjoying Intel's MP3 player,"I received this as a gift recently. The giver did much research, looking for the best features at the best price. It seems to have the most features you can get for under [amt.]. I've enjoyed my player, using it in the car by plugging it into the cassette deck, and also using it at the gym while clipped onto my cardio machine. I like that we can fit about 28 tunes into the memory and that I can pretty much do any function with one hand. I wish the tracks could be put in a new order after being loaded in the memory, though. Also, the headset that comes with the player did not suit me. Maybe I have a narrow head, but these headphones do not stay put. I am using another set of headphones instead. Wrapping the band of the headphones around the back of your head looks cool, but it fights gravity and ends up slipping. Overall though, I really like my player and plan to use it for many workouts to come."
4,"Great product, but don't let it get wet!","Overall, I love the Intel. But I am on my third one. They first shorted out from me sweating on it while running. The second shorted when I got caught in a rain shower. If you plan on using it outside while running, just make sure it does not get wet. Love the neckphones, once I finally got used to them. The radio [is awful]."
4,"Great Player, But Extinct","Had I known that Intel would cease production of its mp3 player line a year after releasing it, I would have bought something else. I really enjoy my player but now there's no support if something goes wrong :("
2,Outdated and obsolete,"EDIT:I've since replaced this with an iPod which *can* be used with Windows, if one downloads the Xplay software. For only [money]more, the iPod has a 10 hour battery life and 5 GB of storage!! This Intel player is now dated and obsolete, especially for the price.[Old Review]Strong Points: 128 MB of RAM Good battery life Nice form factor and design Much better headphone amp than averageWeak Points: VERY POOR Radio reception. RAM is non-expandable. Intel Audio Manager does not include file compression capabilities, so your 128 MB doesn't give you as many songs as the equivalent RAM on a Rio if you use Rio Audio Manager's file compression capabilities when transferring to the portable."
3,Good but hard to watch,"This dvd is pretty rare, it has three video's to start with In League, I Reject and Love Stinks the J. Giels song from the 80's all video's are good quality. Then starts the bootleg video's of them in concert, the quality goes way down hill but the songs are still good. It was originaly on vhs and some of it looks like the tracking on the tape is adjusting. I have all of Bile's cd's so I had to get it. I first found them on the Dee Snider movie "" Strangeland"" where they make a guest appearance. All in all the quality is bad but the show atmosphere is good. I recommend it to bile fans but newcomers should try their cd's first. Start with Frankenhole which you can probably get here on amazon. Three stars for bad quality."
5,Orchestre = Orchestra,"Yes, this album is the same as another listed here on amazon, but with the slighly altered band name. Track listing is:1. Son de Llama2. On Verra a3. Tante Marie4. Africa5. Fuego6. Sibam7. Wane Ma Maguiss8. Thioisanne9. Mi Son10. Digon Gama...and yes, this is another great album from the famous dance band from Senegal. Many of these songs will sound familiar to Boabab completists, but the production on this CD is actually rather good and better then some of the other releases.Highlight of this album for me, at least currently, is the excellent Tante Marie, a mellow groove with a wicked and beautiful guitar solo from the amazing Barthelemy Attiso."
4,Bratz Play Sportz Doll Skiing,Limited little stuff with this toy reducing the risk of losing the fun little parts.
5,It's all good,"Even if you didn't like the movie (which i thought rocked) get this sound track, it is the heart and soul of what techno is, or should be. With mdern techno gods like leftfield, org & orbital, you will not be disapointed. upbeat and in theme with the hackers movie you'll find yourself wanting to dance through most tracks on the album. The best track on the album in my opinion being track no. 2 Toxygene by Orb, which is twisted and powerful. GET IT! GET IT! GET IT! is all i can really say i personally believe you will not be disapointed regardless of your musical tastes anyone can appreciate it. cheers all"
4,Great Soundtrack - if you like Techno,"I love techno, so I really got into this Album. The mix is excellent, and it makes great music for a party. But if you don't like hard-core techno like Prodigy, you probably won't enjoy this album. Warning: if you play this in the car, you're likely to drive 15 miles over the speed limit! :)"
5,Wonderful Christmas Movie,"Whyt is this NOT on DVD. It is a very enjoyable Christmas movie. Mimi Rogers is just right for the part of Melody. I have been waiting to see this again, and just happened to come upon it at 7AM. Didn't get to see the whole show, had to go to work. Of course this will be the one the networks don't show 4 or 5 times."
5,The Best,This is the best Christmas movie ever it should have been out on dvd along time ago. They should air it more on television it only airs once or twice around the holiday season on abc family channel.Awesome movie you can watch it over and over again.
5,Love this movie,"I can't wait to see it every year. I have to remember to record it this year though, because I don't think they'll ever put it on dvd. I sure wish they would."
5,need this movie is so great for christmas!!!!!!!!!!!,I been looking everywere for this movie on vhs tape and on dvd cannot find it I feel sad is been a year now since starting looking for it is so great movie for christmas is a great classic hope it come on dvd soon .
5,Please release The Christmas List on dvd,"This is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies. No bad language, true love conquering all, a real family movie. Love the scene where Melody dumps Creme Brulee in the idiot boyfriends lap. Marla Maples is great as Faith. One thing, Melody, don't you know that burning that list only gives it more power? To the studio -PLEASE release this movie on DVD!"
5,Wonderful Christmas movie - a real uplifter!,THis is a wonderful Christmas movie - a real uplifting movie for this time of year. I look for it every year and it is hard to find. Please release the DVD!!!
2,The Christmas List,I did not realize THE CHRISTMAS LIST was taped on a DVD from televisionwith all the commericals. Apparently I did not read the fine print.
4,The Christmas List,Have been looking for this movie for ever. Was very glad when I found it It is one of my favorites. It is very well done and will order more from you
4,Another Christmas...,"Another Christmas, and STILL no DVD available for ""The Christmas List"". Who do I sue?"
5,My Favorite Christmas Movie!,"Not only is this movie not available on DVD, but I cannot even find a listing for it being shown locally this year on the ABC Family website. Please, let TPTB release this on DVD so all of us may enjoy it for years to come!"
5,The Christmas List,"This film was shown on tv in the UK a few years ago and I was lucky enough to record it. However, I have not seen it on since and my copy is rapidly wearing out. I really hope that it is released soon! I'm sure there loads of people this side of the pond who would love to own a really great feel good family movie."
5,The Christmas List with Mimi Rogers,"This is such a darling fun movie for anyone who likes a cute singles romance with some humor and magical fun chimed in. I absolutely loved it and when I found the video at the Library I checked it out every chance I got. It was not a very good recording but I enjoyed it so much. I am ecstatic that this is finally coming out for purchase. And on DVD! Hurray!!!! I so look forward to purchasing it when it is released. I have looked and looked and finally, it is coming out for sale soon. I would venture to say it is a chic flick for sure, one of my favorites."
5,Feel good holiday movie,I love this movie. It puts me a great spirits for the holiday season. I wish it was made on DVD. It's lighthearted and refreshing for family entertainment during Christmas.
4,Great Book..Loved It,"I did find some of the recipes were a bit hard, but all in all, I had fun trying to make them all. I am not very good at it, but I have always wanted to learn what my Grandmother could do. I have since become pretty good at canning and jelly making. The recipes are very accurate ingredient wise, but make sure you read the directions before starting. It can get confusing..but if you read it twice it makes sense. I am in Japan right now, so haven't had a chance to try them all as I need some ingredients I can't get here. Buy this book...your family will love you for it, and it saves money! You no longer have to buy jelly for $3 at the grocery store."
2,By Far One Of The Worst Films Ever Made,"This is probably one of the worst films I have ever scene; the acting Terrible. The plot? Weak. The character development? Non-exisistant. The only saving grace? Interesting camera angles and a few worthy mentioned ""scares"". I have to intention to see this film ever again, and am thankful that I wasn't the one that paid to watch filth.The story (told around many a campfire worldwide) a young teen is babysitting a couple of children and somehow a stranger gets in the house and attacks her. The movie would probably have gotten another star if there was a plot twist or a few more saving graces.These five star reviews I'm seeing are obviously by children that have no taste in film, I will admit that it's not an academy award winning film but merely pure entertainment. But I can't even see the redeeming value in that. The film is unsatisfiable."
3,This movie is all right,The old one is good this 1 is just allright. Not scary but entertaining. The best part of the movie is the house its huge and makes the movie fun to watch. This is a movie to rent not buy.
3,A good rental,"This is a pretty good movie as far as horror films go. As the movie progresses it uses some old fashion techniques a few too many times to scare the audience. The result? A movie that is not more than a descent rental. The only downfall to waiting to rent this movie is that the scare tactics will not work near as well on a small television.Now the upsides to this movie. It is scary. I don't mean Nightmare on Elm Street scary, I mean suspenseful scary. The suspense in this movie definently adds to the overall value of the moments of horror.Overall this movie is a good rental for people who love horror movies, but a must-see for those who don't watch this kind of movie much."
2,Shocked at how terrible it turned out to be.,"When A Stranger Calls has few scares and more bores. The story follows Jill, a high-school student who decides to baby-sit for a doctor's little boy and girl. While she is pulling an all nighter on baby-sitting, she starts getting prank calls from somebody, of whom she thimks is her boyfriend. The man turnes out to be someone else, but he won't say who. All he can say is, ""have you checked the children?,"" which is terrifying...at first. The film hardly explains anything, and it's an hour and a half of Camilla Belle running around, talking to the guy. This unexplained, dull, so-called ""horror"" film, is more of a bore. If I were you, I might even reconsider renting this."
4,This review partially written by my teen - and friends,"If you want an adult perspective, I thought it wasn't all that great. If you are considering letting your teens see it, mine really liked it. Here are the parts I can tell that don't have major spoilers:These are actual sentences from my son and a group of his friends:1""Starts off slow""2.""WAY cool house!""3. ""The babysitter was hot""4. ""Gets really scarey later""5. ""SOme people in the audience were screaming but we didn't""6. ""Some people laughed at some parts.""7. ""It was pretty good""8 "" Not as good as the first movie""The plot? It is a remake of an older film (yes, ANOTHER remake of an old film) about a babysitter getting prank calls only to discover...(and if you don't know the rest, I won't give it away because that would be a MAJOR spoiler)."
2,Not that scary.,"Believe me. I saw this movie when I was 12. (I am now 14) I also saw this movie recently. Both times I found it very disapointing. It really isn't that scary. I has an awesome plot, though. But, like I said, not really that scary."
1,It well deserves one star rating.,"And I don't mean zero stars or negative stars, I meant one full shining star for eerie soil-your-pants type of music pervasively played throughout the movie. If you don't care for the music you can fast forward the flick and watch the whole thing in less than 10 minutes without missing one bit."
3,"Good Movie, Bad Acting","When A Stranger Calls is a well made movie with a good plot. The only downfall to this movie is the acting. The main actress is noticably acting, the only thing she's good at is screaming. I would recommend this movie, and it would be a lot better with some top-notch stars in it."
1,Boring,"The problem with this movie was the acting. The setting was eerie but the actors seemed to just be asked off the streets if they wanted to star in a movie. None of them seemed to have any experince in acting. The movie was over after twenty minutes when I found out they had a maid. They hired a babysitter and they have a maid, see the problem? All in all, im glad I watched this on tv rather then rent or buy it."
1,Terrible,The first one wasnt that great but this one is way worse. It makes the first one look like a classic. It has a little bit of a different plot than the original. This was stupid. This gets worst movie of the year.
1,There are remakes that improve upon the original...,"... and then there's movies like this year's WHEN A STRANGER CALLS.This movie did not take the frightening yet realistic premise of the original 1970s horror classic and update it for modern tastes, a la the new HILLS HAVE EYES and this summer's OMEN remake. Instead, they just dumbed it down, cast an ineffective lead and took away what made the original so chilling, namely the sadistic violence, which was seldom seen in the original, but used effectively when on-screen.To say this remake was unnecessary would be a gross understatement. If you want to watch WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, buy the 1970s original starring Carol Kane. It's scarier, better acted and more well-written than this garbage."
3,Not That Bad...Could Have Been Much Better Though!,"First off let's get this one out of the way...the remake is not as good as the original! I will say though this version isn't that bad aside from it's very crappy ending & the fact that the house in this movie reminds us again and again how lazy, selfish & materialistic the human race is especially with the very real global warming issue at hand. This one does contain alot of the same good old fasion suspense that made the original so damn good. The acting is decent and I think the films pace was dead on.In the end though the anticipation that shouldered this thriller didn't deliver the explosion it seemed to promise and fell flat on it's face."

1,What could be around the corner...........OH NOTHING at all,"Well this movie was quite a disappointment. All it was, was the babysitter, Jill, looking around every part of the house, and finding NOTHING. Extremley disappointing. COuld have been a whole lot better. The ending is extremly corny as well. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
2,Dead out of the gate....,"This movie never really had a chance, because the previews for it tell you before you ever see it that the caller is inside the house. That and the fact that it was a remake basically kills the premise, because as soon as the stranger of the title starts calling you know where he is, and it becomes an exercise in frustration because you know everything that the girl doesn't, so there's no tension because you end up just sitting there waiting for her to find out what you knew before you sat down. The original worked because they left some secrets for you to find out in the end, but this one seems to be trying hard to keep it under wraps when everyone already knows. And if you already know the biggest part of the movie going in, then what's the point?"
1,The WORST movie I've seen in years!,"And believe me, I've seen a lot. And I've seen all the horror flicks, and this one is just atrocious. No plot, ZERO suspense, horrible acting, bad directing...please, save your money and your time!"
1,Unplug the phone,"The previews for this movie looked good, but I was mistaken. The ringing of the phone in the movie drove me nuts, their has been scenes in Scream that got me by the edge of my seat, but this one just bugged me. No real known actors in this except for Tessa Thompson from Veronica Mars for about 5 minutes throughout the whole movie. And Camilla Belle was decent in this, just not a good script, I was wanting to fast forward through the movie just to end it. The Grudge spooked me for a PG-13 movie, but this PG-13 movie was more for 13 year olds and younger."
4,Surprisingly good!,"i wanted to see this movie after hearing about it, and it did not dissapoint. the movie got off to a creepy and mysterious beggining all the way to a great ending.overall the movie is great with its jump and mystery scenes. the director sure knows how to get the hair in the back of your neck to rise, even if the mystery scene (with great music) turned out to be not to scary."
3,good movie for a young kid's slumber party,"This movie isn't too shabby and it's worth a rental ... or buy and ""regift"" to your favorite preteen horror enthusiast. There were some genuinely creepy scenes, but they were few and far between. The lead actress does a good job of portraying the teen babysitter, but the plot holes and inconsistencies were glaring: the house was decorated in an unrealistic manner, she should've called the police much earlier given that she was so scared, blah blah blah.This movie might frighten an 8 year old, but I overheard a teen moviegoer complain that it was ""too short and not scary enough.""And I agree."
1,Top 10 worst movies i have seen,This was a disgrace to all movies pretty much. I can not even believe a movie this bad would be released in theaters. They should have paid people to have to sit through this movie. I have seen over 700 movies in my lifetime and this was in the top 5 worst by far.
1,BORING (maybe some spoilers),"This movie seriously could have been 10 minutes long. Nothing happened almost the whole time! I paid $10 to watch a girl pace around a creeky house for 2 hours, then get chased for 5 minutes at the end. There were no ""scares"" until literally the last ten minutes of the movie, which weren't even scarey! It was ridiculous. The tense scenes before then all kept ending up to be nothing, like her friend stopping by the house to say hello or the cat knocking something over. Do not see this movie if your expecting a good horror flick. Not even the music is scarey! Come on."
1,You have got to be kidding!!!,"There were many characters that did NOTHING for the movie. The boyfriend who cheated with the mains character's best friend did nothing. The best friend who apologized by saying ""I'm just a b*tch"" was a poor addition to the ""plot"". The characters in movies are all suppose to tie into the story and most didn't.I was waiting for the mystery to start and it didn't. They closed with some guy we hadn't seen at all as being determined as crazy....hmmm...... why would that be interesting?""A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!"""
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"My boyfriend and I watched this waste of a DVD last night. He fell asleep and for some odd reason I couldn't. This movie was straight up wack. You hear me? WACK! It wasn't funny and it definetly wasn't scary. If Jill wanted to know who was calling her, all she had to do was dial *69. And how come after taking a tour of the house in the beginning she finally goes to check the children when the movie was half way over? If you're a babysitter, wouldn't the first thing you do is check on the children instead looking through someone's jewelry box? Anyway, skip this movie and get the Ring 1 or 2. At least when Samara calls she at least has something to tell you."
1,worst horror movie ever.,I stand corrected on Red Eye being the worst horror movie. This movie's plot is so simple and stupid and basically goes nowhere throughout the whole movie. I have honestly never seen a weak a movie as this. They stall time on the stupid phone calls that keep coming over and over again and her just walking around the house looking around. And then the weakest conclusion ever to the stupidest horror ever. Don't go for the hype. It's not a thriller at all. Just a stupid simple little plot that is extremely boring.
1,I thought it was going to be good,"I dont fell like writing a review i just going to say it , it was not good , it was probaly the worst movies of 2005, i like the original better , it was more blood and killing , and they didnt stay in the house the whole time like the new one , this movie is booooooooring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!And I waste 7.50 Ah did you know they are bringing out a new Texas Chainsaw in october 2006"
4,Decent remake,"I just watched this tonight. Frankly, I didn't expect much. I found the movie to be pretty intense. It was refreshing to watch a horror movie that didn't rely on gore or typical horror film tactics to bring on fright.I remember my sister being scared to death when she first seen the orginal as a teenager. She shares the same name as the tormented teenager in the movie and babysit often so I guess it kind of hit home. I seen the orginal some years later. I found the end part scary. In this remake, I thought it was actually much more scary then the orginal.I'm surprised at some of the bad review written on Amazon about this movie. I think it's definitely worth renting and I own it and will watch it again sometime."
3,"Disappointing, but still Okay","I thought this movie was very disappointing, but at the same time wasn't as bad as it could have been. (So those of you with 1 or 2 star ratings, stop being so dramatic.) There were many parts that could've been worse, so get over it."
2,Joke,"When I got this I thought it was a joke. Yes the old footage is cool, but unfortunately this was filmed before youtube. I have seen all this footage already. My gripe with this set of instruction is that there is no instruction at all. You watch Stephan play the songs and then he refers you to the tab. He doesn't explain anything about what he is doing. If I wanted to learn songs off tab I would have just stuck to the internet. I don't see the point in spending time trying to figure out the tab, it is frustrating to say the least. I was under the impression he would pick apart each song piece by piece and show you how to play...Absolute waste of money IMO. Now the lessons from Ernie Hawkins are great, but the best lessons I have come across are from Kenny Sultan.Stephan Grossman is a horrible teacher, it is laughable when he literally tells you to go and look at the tab. Why should I look at tab, I thought I paid you so I wouldn't have to look at tab."
4,Basic Bic Pens,"We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens, with the white barrel, medium or fine points. I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design. It says white barrel in the description, but I hoped to get this new color. Luckily I did. The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside, and it looks more interesting than the traditional white. But, I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it. It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always, too. Not as good as the Cristal pens, but decent. The Cristal pens have a wider point or something, even though these are both labeled as medium points. If you want a basic blue ballpoint, this is it."
4,"they your basic pen,","The pen are just normal, they work, they a good grip, no leaking. I think they are a great buy if you have a lot of kids in your home or people tend to grab pen away from your drawers. They won't impress anyone in looks but they get the job done."
2,Frustrating to write with,Nothing like writing out a character and looking at it and realizing that half the lines didn't make a mark. Very frustrating to use. Gets two stars because they're cheap and you could leave them out at a business and people wouldn't be very tempted to take them home.
3,Great Pens,these bic pens are great pens which come in a neatly designed box i use these pens in my business for customers to sign their receipts and work orders they last and work well
5,Pens!,"36 pens with 2-day Amazon Prime delivery? Yes please! Seriously though, these are just what you expect: good old Bic ball point pens. Prices seem to vary on this product, so I'd suggest browsing through the various sizes/colors to find the current best deal."
1,Purchase of BIC Red pens,I was disappointed in my purchase. The picture on the box was not what I received.The color is almost a pink instead of a nice red.Ann
1,product may be okay~ but vendor isn't!,"Gooeydoo Books never filled this order: I AM STILL WAITING FOR A CREDIT/REFUND TO MY ACCOUNT. Meanwhile, I would eschew any dealings with this vendor: They do NOT respond to e-mails! I am surprised AMAZON uses them"
4,"Work fine, but caps are a a pain to remove","I like the new design and how comfortable they are to write with, but only annoyance is that the caps are SO hard to pull off initially!! I had to keep twisting and tugging on the caps of all of the pens I've used to far. Otherwise, they're perfect!"

4,Golden Days of berlin Cabaret,"The Berlin Cabaret at its best was the pre-war time 1920 - 38which is covered splendidly on these two CDs. Some of the artists made a big international splash while most are only significant to German audiences of that era. The songs reflect the sharp humour and the cheekiness of the times, revealing the suggestive message of the artists and the great song writers like Friedrich Hollander and Mischa Spoliansky. The booklet of the lyrics is written only in German. [No translation].For lovers of this art and Charlestone days in Berlin, this is a must."
1,Chic CRUCIFIED!!!!,"I've never heard such gratuitous murdering of classic music in my life.If you like 'Sexual Guarantee', please check out the original....'My Forbidden Lover' by Chic...which Alcazar have effectively sped up, banged tea trays and screamed all over.It's a disgrace!!!"
1,Ordinary Mainstream [Junk],"Tedious, nagging, slickly, palstic piece of [input your favourit ...word here]. You just want to puke over it. By the way, ""Sexual guarantee"" is a [close similarity] of at least two different well know house tracks:1) Darryl Pandy meets Nerio's Dubwork - Sunshine + Happness (Nerio's Dubwork Mix)2) Warm - It's In The Music (Gerd Mix)The difference is that in this song they play the sickening refrain from beginning till end. Alcazar gives dance music bad reputation. They also gives Sweden bad reputation since that's where they come from. I simply wish they were deported to outer space."
5,Great book.,"Great book, one that really gets you thinking and looking at some things in scripture in a different way. And helps you to look at the authority of scripture in a different way."
2,A Barthian View of Scripture,"This latest word on the authority of the Bible from Wright is just a warmed over and more sophisticatedly-stated defense of his Barthian view of Scripture, which drives a wedge between God HImself and His written Word, and does not take us beyond the so-called liberal/conservative impass at all. Very disappointing!"
5,Real Airplanes!,"To remember the Century series you have to be ""of a certain age"". I'm getting there. I had this book when it was first published and it still has appeal. The author has made a good balance between pictures, text and color plates; all showing the advance designs of aviation and all the colorful heraldtry of the time. This is a book well worth having in an aviation library."
3,"Mostly pleasing, but...","The majority of pieces on this two-disc set are pleasing to the ear, with most played in period style on period instruments with much finesse. However, there are a number of pieces that venture into modern musical idioms which I found jarring, irritating, and incongruent with the overall set of works. Some people may not be bothered by that. But my own feeling is that a CD of renaissance music should contain nothing but renaissance music and that forays into fusion explorations should be put on a CD of their own. It just doesn't mix well. Some may agree with me, others may not. In either case, you are forewarned. This is not a set for purists."
5,"Heat Treat, Selection, and Application of Tool Steels","A wonderful book for the beginner. Held my attention quite well. Very informative, lots more information than I had anticipated."
1,A waste of time for metallurgical information,"I am always surprized at the lack of information about the metal heat treating field. This book is definitely included in this. Although many of the processing techniques are good, some make me cringe and want to run for cover. The metallurgical information is remaniscent of Biringuccio or Agricola, both written in the 1500's. If you have enough metallurgical knowledge to know what is correct and what processing techniques are good, then you don't need this book. If you don't have enough knowledge to decipher this, then it is unreliable. On a lighter note, the other sections, not dealing with heat treating, seem good."
1,Nothing compared to the PC version,"I recently switched from PC to Mac. I loved all of the versions of Print Shop for PC, but the MAC version has hardly any clip-art images to choose from. I'm not sure why Borderbound hasn't released a newer version of this software for MAC."
4,Print Shop II,"PSII is one of those rare programs that has exceeded my expectations. It has numerous projects that are very user friendly. The only negative I would mention is that the artwork available for greeting cards is is not that extensive, I would like to see more. Other than that I think it is a very worthwhile purchase."
2,Problem Child,"I have used Print Shop for Dos for years and like it very well. Imagine my dismay when the Mac version was SOOOOOO unfriendly. I had to do 26 pages (still haven't figured out how to compile a calendar from them). The original version was easy and made a complete calendar of 12 months, pix pages and a cover. I am VERY disappointed in the product and hope they fix it before next year."
2,What Happened to Printshop?,"I had a ten year old version of Windows Printshop I used all the time that was much better that this version. What did they do to it? The program itself is pretty good but where is the content? Under ready designed cards only Anniversary, Birthday, Best Wishes, Congratulations, Announcements. WHAT ABOUT CHRISTMAS, VALENTINES DAY, GRADUATION, EASTER, NEW BABY, ETC. Also very poor assortment of graphics the box says 19,500 images REALLY, the old windows version says 280,000 and it has cards for every occasion you could think of and it's 10 years old! (I downloaded all updates) Come on Printshop get us some more content!!!!===========Updates (free downloadable) have added many features and more pictures and ready designed categories mush improved I would give it *** 1/2 now with the updates but still not close to the old windows version."
1,Very disappointed compared to Windows version,"I have used Print Shop for many years on my Windows operating systems so I know the program pretty well and really like it. As soon as a new version came out, I bought it. So when I got my iMac of course I had to have Print Shop on it also. I was disappointed to find out that Broderbund did not have a version for the Mac. But another company did, so I was happy and purchased it. Needless to say I was very disappointed with the Mac compatible version. I don't even know why they would call it Print Shop. It is almost a completely different program. The great thing about this program that the Window Program doesn't have, is that you can open two pages at the same time and transfer images from page to another. It is also really slow. I really wish I could get the Windows version for my Mac."
4,PS 2 is a hit!,"Believe it or not, one of the reasons it took me years to switch from PC to Mac was the Print Shop series of card-making programs that I had used for 15 or more years...I couldn't find it's equivalent on Mac. While this isn't apples-to-apples (I was using Print Shop 23 Deluxe for PC), it comes close in features and use. I make all my own greeting, sympathy, birthday, Christmas, etc. cards and had never found another program that allowed me to make cards so easily in the sizes and of the quality I wanted. I use my own photos and write my own scripts. I have never used it for any of the other many functions: calendars, etc., but I would imagine it does a great job with them, too."
2,not as good as Print Shop for windows which I have used for many years.,It is not as user friendly as Printshop for Windows. I have used my pc for years with outstanding results . I cannot use the Mac version with the same results.
3,Print Shop 2 for Mac,I have used Print Shop on a PC for a long time. This is a step back in time as far as graphics go and just the ease of use. Hope they update it soon! Just not as user friendly but it does what I want it to do but with more effort.
4,Good-cheap-easy-NO Mac bugs,"I bought this for my son to use on his Intel iMac (2007). Very easy installation. First launch went seemlessly with no bugs and very compatible with iPhoto and standard Mac commands/interface. Easy to grab photos from multiple sources like chip reader, CD, iPhoto, even cut and paste from internet. Many good features from design templates and editing to special effects and photo retouch. Let's face it, this is not a professional tool or full graphics suite, but for the money it offers a good array of features for the student and home user who wants a little creativity in their collages, albums, or photo editing & printing. This is a hard to find product (low production runs or very popular??)"
3,Disappointed,"I used this program at least 15 years ago when I was a teacher and one would think they would have improved it over the years. Sure it's better than that first version, that my students loved, however the library of graphics is stale, and there are quirks that make it difficult to use. It would not take a lot to make ""The Printshop"" a great program however the company has not chosen to upgrade to my satisfaction. It's usable but could be improved."
4,Print Shop for Mac 2,"The Print Shop for Mac 2 will work with newer Macs like the AirBook and laptops.It is everything that was contained in the older Windows version and more. Everything looks familiar and is created the same way. My favorite are the calendars, in fact, I bought it just for that reason!"
2,Disappointed in program.,"I was disappointed to find this program does NOT have many of the features the Windows versions have. Unfortunately, you don't find this out until after you've ordered and paid for the program."
3,"Not quite, this time","I am a huge TJP fan, and have read all of his books. Sooner or later any great author hits a lull (which may still be better than what lesser writers offer on their best days). Well, this is his...The book is not bad. It is just below TJP's standard. Its chief shortcoming is the endless first-person introspection. It slows down the plot, diminishes the richness of the other characters and drags on unforgivably long after the various plot threads have long been resolved and it's time to wrap up. Where was the editor when this happened?I did finish the book without major regret. Even at his worst, TJP is still, well, ok. But I am looking forward to his return to his usual form."
3,Lacks suspense and moves very slow,"This book was unbearably slow with virtually no suspense as the main character (Robbie Brownlaw) is never in danger during the entire story. I kept expecting the something bad to occur to him as he was investigating corruption within the police and political arena while trying to solve a murder. Additionally, Robbie has the ability to tell when people are lying (he sees red triangles coming out of the speaker's mouth when they are lying) but that ability comes into to play very little.Additionally, Robbie's wife leaves him for apparently no reason and it only at the very end do we learn why and even then it doesn't sound right. The book does have a few interesting points though and I give it credit for that, such as a program that can rapidly search data bases to determine if an individual might be a threat."
3,The Fallen: A novel,"A different approach to being a crime fighter. At times, the novel, was quite engrossing.But, in the end, it all seemed, just too preposterous. I was not interested, in reading, anything further, about Robbie Brownlaw."
4,Not a dective novel fan,"But I really enjoyed this novel! I think it popped up when I put synesthesia into Amazon search. I took a chance and bought it.I really liked this book. The characters were very multidimensional, and intriguing. It had a good ending, something I aways look for in a book.I have put this on on a shelf, and consider it a keeper."
5,"""buy me... buy me""","I t reads through the eyes of the synesthesiac with out letting it get in the way. Gripping, enjoyable tension, with out being terrifying, this book takes you through a gamut of emotions. An enjoyable read that keeps you reading late into the night."
2,Not the best by far,"I feel a bit of an outsider here reading the other reviews...I am a BIG fan of Parker and loved his other recent work, soI looked forward to The Fallen. However, I did not like this book. I found it slow and plodding, without much by way of a plot. Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about who themurderer could be amid all the talk, talk, talk, the watching videos,the failed marriages, why he changed his tie, dear God, I was glad to finally just get the bad guy although it was such a contrived and silly scene. And then he couldn't end the book!! It went on and on after all was (I had hoped) said anddone. I'll read the next one and hope T.Jefferson gets back to form."
2,padding excess!,"allthough the book has a nice plot, has also padding in excess. Too bad for a book wich could be better."
4,towel,"thinner than I was expecting, but cute. The colors are quite vivid. My daughter was thrilled, and that is what counts."
2,Not a very good book,"This book has its moments, and sometimes it is interesting. However, the author tries way too hard to make the concept of the Hinge Factor work. In fact, most of the battles he lists have dozens of stupid points and no one hinge factor. The hinge concept is contrived and strained. Also, the battle descriptions are sometimes good and sometimes difficult to follow."
3,"Some military yarns - no more, no less","Think of this as a novelization of famous military battles - unless you believe a stenographer was recording all the conversations at Agincourt in 1415. If you like military history, you'll probably enjoy these. Prior military knowledge will help, as the author doesn't always provide much context, and occasionally lapses into military jargon.The title theme - the various factors that influenced these battles - seems like an after-thought, added by an author or publisher who thought the book needed a hook. Durschmied's ""hinge factors"" range from good strategy to bad weather to a swarm of bees, and focusing on them adds no interest or depth to the book."
2,Needless,"While this book is somewhat interesting, I was greatly distracted by the endless grammer mistakes and typos (General Sumner occasionally becomes ""General Summer"", etc.) and, to a larger extent, the fact that this book is outdone in length, style, and execution by other books, such as the Guiness Book of Military of Blunders."
3,The Whinge Factor,"Durschmied has put together an interesting compilation of historic encounters that entertains as it educates. Nonetheless, how the pitifully inadequate maps made it past his editor is another question. One wonders whether such poor illustrations are in fact the hinge factor that relegates this book to the middling category."
1,Badly Written and Full of Errors.,"This book was a failure on virtually every front.The author simply did not pay attention to basic facts. For example, in his chapter on the Battle of Tanga he referred to the battle as ""the initial battle in Africa's share of the First World War"" (November 1914). This is wrong. There was fighting in the Cameroons in August of 1914, in South West Africa (todays Namibia) in September of 1914, and so forth.He also suggests that if the Battle of Tanga had turned out ""differently"" the ""World War, African Segment"" would have been finished in 1914. This ignores numerous other battles in other parts of Africa (for example the ""Lakes Region"" and South West Africa) which lasted well after 1914.These factual errors are compounded by the errors in language. Throughout the book inappropriate slang is used, and the writing style is rather ""breathless"" and ""sensational"". He tends to describe various individuals as ""moving like a beetle"".It isn't worth the time to read."
1,The Hinge factor by Eric Durschmied,"The author has written another book ""From Armagaddon to fall of Rome"" In it there is a very serious factual error. On Chapter on Alexander the grea, he has hinted strorngly that one of his generals, four Lysamachus, was responsible for establishing Mauryan dynasty of India. Also that Emperor Asoka was "" involved in the foundation""Both of these assertions are factually incorrect.Mauryan empire was founded by Chandragupta and in fact he defeated general Selucas deep inside Indiain view of such errors, it is difficult to place reliance on other facts provided by the author in his books re happenings in early times."
1,Looks like a TV pilot.,"What would you get if you mixed two parts ""ER"" with two parts ""Dynasty""? You might think that you would get something steamy yet emotionally intriguing. Instead, you might end up getting an awful medical melodrama called ""Doctors' Wives"".I have never understood why any movie would have its most interesting character killed off in the first fifteen minutes. The one and only excusable circumstance would be if you show that character in a lot of flashbacks. That doesn't happen in this film and it suffers severely.""Doctors' Wives"" has the look and feel of a TV pilot. There really isn't much location shooting to speak of. Most of the film takes place in a hospital or at the characters' homes. The screenplay is much more interested in introducing a lot of characters to you rather than fleshing any of them out. As a movie, it is dull and laughable. As a TV pilot, it showed that it might have eventually become rather interesting. Or then again...maybe not."
5,Wicked!,"My husband and I purchased this chess set for our daughter two years ago for Christmas (she was almost 7 at the time). Our family is big into chess, and we wanted to get our daughter her own chess set. This set is super cute for little girls (or any Hello Kitty fan), and my daughter relates much better to this set than the traditional pieces. Rather than having to always play chess with someone else's set when we have our family chess tournaments, she can bring out her very own set to use. We like that the box is made of metal, (no cardboard to wear out and tear), and the chess board is printed right on the back of the box, (no separate board to get broken, mis-folded, etc). All of the figures are plastic, so no worries if one rolls of the table onto the floor like with some other specialty chess sets. We feel that this was a great deal for the money, and two years after purchase, it's still one of our daughter's favorite toys!"
5,Instant Classic,I bought this album back in 98. This is by far one of the most important albums in my collection. It's a true break through in trance. The soft melodies accompanied by the steady beats makes for an excellent dance or chill album. I own a lot of trance and this one knocks most of the better known trance artists out of the competition. BUY THIS ALBUM! IT'S AMAZING!
5,Excellent relaxing trance music,"Chicane stands out of other trance acts in style and originality. A cool combination of hypnotic break beats, straight forward trance dance and dreamy soundscapes. Great for chillin' out and dreaming away.A must have for trance fans."
4,My apologies,"I don't think this CD will ever make it to five stars just because it didn't meet my huge initial expectations which in part is due to the stellar reviews it had received. I popped this CD in the other night and was more impressed by it than EBTG's Tempramental, and BT's ESCM (two four star albums in my opinion). Red Skies was much better than I remembered it. I had to play the song over just so I could fully appreciate it. Offshore 97 still is my favorite song and the Drive Home concludes what is a better listen than I originally gave it credit for."
5,Great New Edition,"The 2006 edition of this book is excellent. It is entirely new, clear, concise and informative. It has a new author and is so much better that the previous editions it should have a new title."
3,Here we go again,"Yes, this is a word processor for kids. It is fun and uncomplicated. I will be able to use it as I do not need most of the assesories in the normal office suite. I do have one minor problem.Years ago (CPM days) when one bought a word processor one also had to buy a spell checker and a dictionary. These programs were run seperatly from the word processor and processed the data file from the word processor. Modernly I have become spoild. I was not aware that anyone least of all Micro-Soft was making word processors without these tools implanted. Did I miss something or do I have to go back to ordering a seprpate program to get these needed items?Will Cook"
2,Too Old,"I bought this not really knowing what it is. My mistake. I was looking for a way to help me formulate my creations for TeachersPayTeachers. I'm not a whiz on Microsoft Word and creating things. This is too old for today's world. It worked but there was nothing useful for me. Yes, I knew it was geared toward kids, but I was OK with that. I thought it might have some cool formats or something. No such luck. Guess I'll have to take a class or something."
2,Too much degradation...,"While true, this plugin will enhance just about any picture, if your final output is print, there is too much degradation. However, if your final output is the web, this is a great product. I recomand scaling down the image after enhancement."
5,New Sound Alternative,"This first album from Vex Red is an interesting genre. A unique voice mix up with guitar, bass, drum and electronic...This is really fun to hear. The first single reflect exactly the album. Start With A Strong And Persistant Desire is an album to buy for sure!"
5,"It will ""start with a strong and persistent desire""","Hellalujah !! Finally a band that's more than just the plastic wrapping it's sealed in.Track 1: The Closest ,pretty much sums up the album in only 4min. 47sec. Dark and moody guitars bleed into distorted rage burnt with electronic beauty and fades out into a downward spiral of emotion and sadness. Then there's track 2. It's a very mature album for a new band but think it would take time before people warm up to them in an age where ROCK music is flooded with Creed ,Papa Roach sounding bands. The production is great. Ross Robinson manages to keep the ""theme"" well intact throughout the album. The sleeve is filled with obscure drawings as dark and interesting as Terry Abbott's lyrics. The guitars are ""grungy"" ,filled with troubled desire. The drumming is brilliant with emotion.If you buy this album you won't be sorry. It will leave you ""with a strong and persistent desire"" for MORE."
3,CK2000,"I installed the lock system on my daughter's 2009 Hyundai Civic. It does work but prepared for many hours of work. The wiring is very time consuming. WARNING: The keyless entry system that came m/ the lock set was a problem. The wiring diagram included is incorrect. Like the last poster, the lock/unlock were reversed. I called for Tech help from the manufacturer and was gven a remedy. It's apparent they have not updated the wiring instructions for the enclosed keyless entry system. The only other problem I had was with the mounting strap. It was too short for my car and I had to purchase longer ones. I highly recommend the several videos available online prior to attempting the mounting of the acuators."
5,ALMEIDA,My son loves his movies he always gets them on time and in perfect condition. NEVER HAVE ANY DELAYS WITH ANY PURCHASE....Thx M&A
4,Different and entertaining,Not the best movie and it had its share of issues but overall was entertaining. I kept it for my collection.
3,Kind of hoakey,I didn't enjoy the movie much. But my son loves the movie and it was a gift for him andhe is happy.
1,check warranty,"Make sure you check the warranty. I purchased this bat. It was a wonderful bat. It made it through 30 games and then cracked near the handle. It was well taken care of. Easton's warranty is only good for one year. They don't return phone calls, e-mails or letters. Figure on one years use. I paid $299 for a bat that lasted 30 games and is out of warranty. Such a fool. Don't be a fool."
4,Back In Form: A Spiral Into Madness,"While I feel in love with the first volume of Uzumaki for its haunting style and bizarre incarnations of the ""spirals,"" the second one left me somewhat cold for straying into more standard Ito fare. But have no fear with this final volume, because it returns to basics and gives it very fitting finish! The story, moving from a series of typhoons that swamp the town, follows its inhabitants and stranded rescue workers slowly loosing their humanity as they are increasingly drawn into a single massive spiral at the center of it all. If you enjoy horror, you will can't do much better than this."
3,Uzumaki 3 review by Emma,"It was a pretty spooky book, that killed my apitite for 3 days... (had simmilar effects on my friends, too) i can't bear to look at spirals anymore..."
5,Where should I start,"Uzumaki is a great series I have to say. Ive even got the japanese import and it doesnt even work on my dvd player! The third book is probably the most emmotional one, having all the characters (and the readers) thrust into more choas of the spiral (and having kirie lose practically everyone) the story ended on a most pleaing note. I dont want to give it away but the ending just made me say ""aw"" (thts a good thing) The scary thing is about the uzumaki series is tht i hadnt known about it until it just popped up on my screen out of nowhere. Now I have the whole series and the movie wht more could I ask for. This third book (along with his others) have the usually chapter end with the next story having nothing to do with the one before but , to your surprise the last 2 chapters (aside the lost chapter (yes theres a lost chapter)) actually follows up with the next chapter (shock*) I strongly urge you to read this one plus hey its the last one dont you want to kno wht happens?"
4,Satisfactory ending to a great series,"The Uzumaki tale comes to an end in this volume and Ito manages to wrap up the narrative in fairly tidy fashion. As with the entirety of the series, Ito's detailed and intricate art is the standout and the final volume does not disappoint in this regard."
5,A classic,A wonderful book and one I read to my kids so many times that I can recite it word-for-word. This book was a favourite of both my daughters and holds a special place in my heart.
5,"Variety, variety, variety!","I am an English teacher, and this is one of the best sonnet collections I've seen due to its variety and depth. There are some cool rare selections like sonnets from Bartholomew Griffin (who is a total mystery to most scholars) as well as standard favorites from Shakespeare and the Brownings.The cover is beautiful as well!Due to the difficulty of finding this volume, I bought two copies!"
4,Pleased!,Bought this as a Christmas gift and the receiver seems to be pleased. I did discover the item in a store but had already ordered. Shipping was quick and overall I'm pleased.
4,Highlander Original Score,I was very pleased with everything related to my purchase. The quality was clear & clean. The delivery was actually quicker than I expected. I am very pleased.
3,Have it.,"I have the CD (got it from the ""Rock 'n' Roll"" Hall of Fame). The first two songs are excellent, but the later songs in the CD are pretty bad."
3,Never buy a chair before sitting in it!,"It looks a lot better in the picture. I thought it would be very soft and comfortable. It is stuffed with a type of foam that leaves a dent for a while after you sit or put your feet on the stool. It does rock and swivel smooth enough, but the recline could be easier. Fairly easy to put together.Edit!!!! I have had the chair for less than a year, and now the chair is BROKEN! I called ATHOMEMART to get a replacement and he said ""I chose to do nothing"". At Home Mart will NOT stand behind their products! DO NOT BUY FROM At Home Mart!!!!!!!"
2,Would be nice if cushions weren't so hard,"Chairs looks good, however it is uncomfortable. The cushions are to firm and the back is not as high as I would of liked. Chair rocks and swivels fine."
3,"This item the non Amazon, ultimately, was able to supply","I have several of these tracks on various vinyl albums, which I enjoy.Take away that most of the vocals are in Japanese and it could by one of the better mid seventies prog bands.The rating isn't a true indicator as I've not heard all of the tracks."
5,Loved these!,A favorite from years past. Enjoyed them greatly. Looking forward to release of season 2.
5,Great Show,This show is so fun to see again! I would highly recommend it for family TV nights. Does anyone have any info on when Seasons 2 and 3 are coming out?
4,"Happy, but could have been better","Finally bought Young Riders Season 1 and although the show is just as good as I remember I was a little disappointed with the DVD set. First of all there were no extras. A gag reel or a behind the scenes look would have been kinda cool. I also had a problem with the volume. The dialog was so quiet and if you turn up the sound the music blasts you out of your chair. But all in all, very happy with the DVD and looking forward to seasons 2 and 3 being released."
5,PLEASE Release season 2,This was the best short lived series. WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO RELEASE THE SEASONS 2 & 3!
5,I am so In Love,It's so incredible to finally have it on DVD. I don't know where to begin I love everything. I do wish there was some special features butthey did add a few extended scenes. Atleast the ones I saw on tv and video taped didn't have some of the scenses I saw on the DVD's. LOL I'm so happy I'm babb;ing. Seriously they really are great adn a must for any fan.
5,Love The Young Riders!,"If you like Westerns, this is the show for you! I have enjoyed watching every single episode.I can't wait for season 2 to be released on dvd!"
4,Childhood Memories,"I have waited a long time for this DVD set. I loved this show when it was on and I have never forgotten it. In fact when my sister called me tonight while I was watching it, I asked her if she remembered the show. Her reply was ""I remember how obsessed you were with it."" I actually remembered almost every second of the first episode even though it had been about 18 years since I had seen it. The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is because of the picture quality. The first disc was great, but miway through the second disc the picture started to get really grainy in certain scenes. With all the tecnology nowadays, why couldn't they clean it up?P.S. Does anyone else remember another show around the same time called Zorro with Duncan Regehr and James Victor. I really wish that they would put that out on DVD also, but it seems like they never will."
5,Good Western,"I like the fact that they finally put this onto DVD. I'm not a big fan of western TV shows, but I do like this one. It is based on the United States history. The Pony Express didn't last long, but it was a great service to America. I also like the fact that it also puts the points of views of who sided with which side of the Civil War.The only thing that I saw wrong with this is the setting. The show takes place in the Nebraska territory, but there are cacti that live only in Arizona and surrounding area. That's the only thing that I saw wrong for location."
5,It's about time,Been waiting for this to come on DVD--a classic western--if you don't remember the show and have never sent it--try it if you like westerns--it was a really good show with excellent stories.
2,Campy,"This season was overacted, melodramatically written with too convenient plot devices, and is very predictable. Like most western series the protagonists go through a weekly series of outlandish situations where they must risk life and limb, but overcome odds that would be insurmountable to average people. Most of the stories were just variations on tired old situations that have been done to death in older series.We are supposed to believe that these kids are pony express riders in Wyoming, but the scenes in all the episodes, except the pilot, are filmed in Arizona. Arizona landscape and vegetation are significantly different from Wyoming.I still give it two stars for nostalgic reasons, having enjoyed to campy pleasures of watching this series when it was on TV."
1,Each disc skipped and froze completely at times,"2 out of every three episodes were fine, but the third skipped incessantly, or froze completely. They were ""New In The Box,"" but hardly acted like it."
5,When is season #2 coming out????,"I never watch television series so I had never seen this before I purchased it based entirely on all the favorable customer reviews. Nothing else I could say that someone else hasn't already said, except... WHEN IS SEASON TWO GOING TO BE RELEASED???????Edward J. Erler Jr."
5,At Last!,"I am so happy that the first season has been released on DVD. This has been a favorite show of mine since it aired. I recomend the DVD's for anyone who liked the show when it was on tv, or anyone who enjoys westerns. I'm hoping that all the seasons will be released soon!"
5,1 question,"just as good as i remember it being, the only drawback is having to wait for season 2. when is it coming out?????? I hate when they make us wait, it's not like the series is new, let us have em all!!!!!!!!!"
5,Rainforest!!?,"The rainforest comes alive with this MSB issue. Microsoft shows us why most of the cures for our maladies, etc. comes from rainforests. And, why we shouldn't keep destroying them. Kids learn all about the value of a rainforst. My seven year old played the heck out of this selection, and when we visited a real rain forest in Nov. 2003, he knew what to expect. And, of course, MSB helped..."
5,Great solution for my old TV set,"My old color TV only had one input - coaxial. All I had to do was run RCA jacks from my DVD player to the modulator and a coaxial cable from modulator to TV, set the TV and modulator to channel 3, and bingo! In the beginning there was a humming sound coming from somewhere, but it went away after several hours and I haven't heard it since then. The humming might have been caused by the TV set, which had been in storage for many years.The image and sound quality are as good as its going to get with this TV, and I'm satisfied. I have not tried the S-video connection."
2,Poor video quality.,I bought this to replace a GE RF Modulator that only had composite input and not s-video. The GE version has better video quality even with only composite video.I have a long run from my dish to a tv in an upstairs bedroom and with all the same cables the GE version is noticeably better.GE 87631 RF Modulator
2,Worse Than an Old VCR,"I bought this modulator to convert the composite output of my VCR to NTSC RF for a new TV that doesn't display my VCR properly through its own composite input.This modulator does a worse job of producing a stable RF picture than the old, mono, broken VCR I was using to do the same job. With both devices, the picture jumps slightly up and down randomly. But with this modulator, there's also sometimes a brightness fluctuation in a band across the middle of the picture.And this modulator does a bad job of passing through digital TV antenna signals. With the power disconnected I was able to receive all the channels through the modulator that I normally get. With the power connected, only one came through. This won't be a problem for most people since they'll be using it with old, analog TVs.I'm going to keep using the old VCR rather than this modulator. It isn't worth returning, so I'll keep it as a back-up to the old VCR. And I may find some use for its 9 volt, 100mA DC supply."
1,Bad picture quality,"I bought this item to hook a dvd player up to an older tv in a spare bedroom. I picked this one due to price and I trust the name Belkin. Boy did they let me down this time.The picture quality and sound are horrid. Ive tried just about everything, using different cables, different tvs and dvd players, but the picture has moving diagonal lines going through it and sometimes static. The sound is the sound from the dvd and static combined, about 50/50.Avoid this one at all costs, guess I got what I paid for."
1,Lines in the video and `buzzing' after a few months,"I wanted to use this to connect my Direct TV receiver to other TVs via coax. It worked fine for a while, but after a few months, I noticed this unit started producing lines in the video that would cause buzzing. I tried shortening the power cable as someone else commented on in another review which did not help I even tried using the S-video input with no difference. It's now too late to return the unit ( The cost of shipping back for warranty does not make returning it worthwhile.) I will try a different one from a local store so I can return it if it does not work."
3,poor quality,this modulator caused a lot of interference with poor picture / bought another one made by rca and it worked perfectly
1,Okay if you don't mind a fuzzy picture,"I returned this modulator after trying several different methods to improve picture quality. No matter what I tried I ended up with a picture that struggled to sync and, at best, had a 2-inch strip across the top of the picture that was distorted."
5,Belkin rf modulator,"I purchased this rf modulator since I have a relatively new DirecTV dvr/receiver, which does not have coax outputs. However, since I wanted to connect this receiver to an older TV, which has only coax inputs, I needed some way to convert the signal from the DirecTV receiver to coax. I have used this rf modulator for this purpose since receiving it in December and, so far, it has worked perfectly without any problems."
5,Great product,"Great little gadget at a fraction of the price of my local stores. My son can now use an older spare tv to play his video games, saving me a few hundred dollars not having to buy a new tv. Free shipping is an excellent feature that will keep me coming back."
1,"Pg. 3, ""The audio signal will be modulated to mono, whether the video source is stereo or monaural.","Yep, that's it, only handles mono audio. Wish I'd known that before purchase and opening the package. This one's headed home."
1,Terrible,Sorry but both 2 of those are very bad i see good pic in B&W only and customer service is terrible !!!
3,Seems to work just fine,"I titled this ""seems to work just fine"" because I bought it for my father. He is a non-technical minded person and managed to get it hooked up, so setup must be pretty easy. Of course, this is just a couple of cables in/out so it's really hard to mess it up. He's had no issues with it so it's working ""just fine""."
1,Waste of money,Looked like a good device but never worked.This was back when I was trying to connect my wireless to an old RF input TV.Better to just by a TV with real inputs.
4,The Revenge Of Ishta,"The book is in great shape.I haven't read it yet but looking to very soon.To Bad the book isn't longer,And has more Info.The Art work is very Good"
5,Bliss-Perfection in Cinematography,"Both beautiful and bizarre, touching and surreal, Bliss is an amazing film that will linger with the viewer for long after the final credits have rolled. We see the twists and turns of life through Barry Ottos eyes, granting us insights otherwise not available. I highly recommend it to any cynic with a heart. Beautiful."
5,Great Movie,"A twisted mental trip, simply done but very compelling. I enjoy this movie!This dark comedy has some truly funny moments (i.e. the fish falling from his cheating wifes vagina when she's feeling guilty about cheating on him.) I recomend this movie for people with an intellect, if you're looking for fart jokes and slap stick this probably isn't the film for you."
4,Region Free DVD ???,"Purchased Pal 0-region DVD version from Boulevard Entertainment of this movie on AMAZON-UK. To my surprise, this DVD plays on my PC, on my US players except my Blue Ray player. It is full screen-stereo 112 minute version even tho it says 107 minutes on the box. Looks like a VHS transfer but in pretty good quality. Pretty cheap price to boot. Cover art is the same. I think most of you fans will be satisfied with this version as I am..until something better comes up on the market. Hope this helps..."
4,A dream journey into the corruption of modern life.,"Through the life story of Harry Joy, the main character, we see a quirky and gentle jesting of everyday modern life presented in an almost surrealistic manner. A modern Candide, our hero finds himself a stranger in a strange land surrounded by drug-dealing children and immoral wife, he escapes the trap of success to find a happy life in his own garden world. A truly fun trip."
2,out of date,"The front cover of this book looks very good but the inside content is out of date. When I was truning the pages I immediately saw a lot of mistakes. At the fist pages the author says one day it will be possible to clone and resurrect mammoths from a modern elepanth's womb but today we now that it is impossible because the difference between mammooths and elepahtns are so large like between humans and apes. Secondly the book uses family trees, but today we use modern cladistic system to define relationships between species. (i should have known this because the book was released in 2002....) To compare it with contemporary books I found it a little bit boring, and doesnt have enough images inside it. It has a part that presents the species lived in the ice age, I think the author should have written about much more species. And a lot of pages describe modern relatives of distinct species which I think is unnecessary."
4,"Great monitor, short cables","This monitor is great for the price. The image quality is excellent on the 18"" viewable flat screen. It has a max resolution of 1600x1200 at 75hz (contrary to what the official website says), and recommended at 1280x1024 at 85hz with a .20mm dot pitch. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that the cord that connects to the computer is only about two or three feet long which means most people will have to buy an extension cable too. Otherwise, highly recommended..."
4,Perfect holiday gift for a child,Simple easy toy. It's quick to stuff with the fiber provided. There is a locking mechanism in the zipper so it doesn't come undone but adult can use a pin to release it if it needs more stuffing in the future.
5,Physical Science,This book is great! I already learned a lot in just 5 days! This book shows you pictures and a lot more! What I like about it is; it tells you a short story and it tells you how it is related in real life at the beginning of each section! I recommend this item to you!
1,Waiting and Waiting,"I ordered a book for my daughter's school and for 4 weeks the site has said shipping soon. School has now started, and I still have no book. I have emailed the seller twice and two business days later, and still no response to my inquiry. They claim customer service, but I haven't seen it yet."
3,eh,"I love swans and I love young god records. Still though, this is a waste of your money since you'll probably want to buy at least 2 of the albums this CD samples from. Still a damn good comp though."
3,32 Nalgene Bottles will not fit,This is great for water bottles or MSR fuel that are smaller than average but not larger.
3,"High quality, but relatively small.","This is a high quality nylon cage. It's easy to adjust to fit difference sizes, but it's WAY too small. I cannot fit my 1-liter SIGG bottle in it, and my 22 oz Camelbak bottle just BARELY fits in it. You would think that if it's an adjustable bottle cage, they would make it fit common bottles sizes, like the 1 liter SIGG size, 1 liter Camebak or the Nalgene 32 oz.Just beware that if you're wanting this bottle cage to fit your 1-liter or similar sized bottle it won't work."
1,Didn't work on my old bike,"This bottle cage just didn't work on my bike. It requires a bike that has screws already in place for bottle cages (my bike is too solid to drill holes in--I tried), and it's not shaped so that you can use clamps. This took me awhile to figure out, as it comes with no directions at all. I took it to a bike shop and ended up just buying a different kind."
5,Bravo for my swimming partner novelist,I had been waiting patiently to read Barbara's book for some time. I have the honor of knowing Barbara from our water workout class and I know how sincerely she has put her heart and soul into this novel.Ladies of the Bourabadour is an exciting and exotic read that takes you to the mysterious land of Indonesia. The lives of the women who follow their oil executive husbands to a strange and unknown world are colorful and sincere.I know this is a book I wish to read over again and I anxiously wait a continuation.
2,Not very efficient non-stick pan,The non-stick material is not very efficient. I made some scrambled eggs with no oil (the pan is new) and the eggs got really stuck to the pan. I know what a high-quality non-stick pan behaves like... I was a bit disappointed. No wonder they are so inexpensive.
5,Excellent.,An incredible recording. The music is rhythmic and driving. The arrangements and original compositions are exciting. This is something for lovers of Celtic music who want some originality while still enjoying the classic celtic melodies.
5,MY KIDS LOVED THIS BOOK,Rick Walton has done a fabulous job of capturing and maintaining a child's attention in this book How Many How Many How Many. The rhyming of words throughout the book makes it catchy for a preschooler and even younger--- my 2 year old loved it as well. It helps children learn numbers in a fun way. This is a keeper for any home library where preschoolers reside.
5,"Great Nancy Drew Case Files, A Real Page Turner....","This was a great book! I couldn't put it down. Not much in terms of romance, but great with mystery and suspense! Nancy gets herself out of so many near death situations that you'd swear she has nine lives!"
4,A good ending to the Paper trilogy!,"This book is heartwarmingly tender. You'll root for Janice as she is learning to love after a lifetime of struggles and heartaches and that Peter is the perfect man to show her how.Be sure to read the first book, Paper Roses and the second book, Paper Tiger. A great trilogy!"
3,"Not quite as ""definitive"" as one might be led to believe...","After I received this CD as a gift, I was somewhat disappointed. I mean, I like Brad Fiedel's musical works here, but the techno-dance cuts included in the first release (as heard in the Tech-Noir scene) are absent here. True, they were kinda corny & pretty much stock-quality 80s pop, but I think they should've been included in this collection if they wanted folks to seriously consider this to be the ""Definitive"" soundtrack CD.After all, the 'Terminator 2' soundtrack CD is missing Dwight Yoakam's ""Guitars & Cadillacs"", Guns & Roses' ""You Could Be Mine"", and George Thorogood's ""Bad to the Bone"", all three of which can be heard in the sequel. You don't see that CD labeled ""Definitive"", now do you?'Late"
5,"Get this one, not the original.","Great electronic sounds for emotion and anti-emotion. If you like the sounds of the movie, get this, and avoid the original(which is clogged with 80's crap) at all costs."
2,disappointing,My 4 year old son has been playing computer games for about 6 months and does really well at navigating the mouse and listening for instructions. I sit with him until I know he knows how to play. I can't leave him with this one. You have to search to find where you want to go and the information I think it gives on the dinosaurs is either below or above his level. He knows alot about dinosaurs and this doesn't expand on anything. I think maybe if it were a little more realistic...and the game gets stuck and acts slowly.
2,Not much of a mystery,"The murder doesn't happen for a long time, and when it did, I found myself not caring very much. The characters didn't seem to care too much either, since there was really no sleuthing going on. The story mostly focused on the lives and backgrounds and family problems of the various characters. Philandering husbands, bratty kids, etc. The characters just sort of proceeded along with their vacation. Not much of a mystery."
2,This is not a visual guide to Xanth,"I rated this low because the title is misleading. This is an encyclopedia of Xanth, not a visual guide. It does give a lot of information on all things Xanth, but most of the items don't have drawings, the few drawings that are there are black and white pencil sketches, and they're often inaccurate--often don't match the descriptions in the books. This is by no means a ""visual guide"", but it does have a lot of information on Xanth and may be of interest to a devoted fan of the series or a collector."
4,Love this song,"This is my favorite song from the comeback album from Blondie. If you enjoy different versions of your favorite songs, as I do, then this is something to get. The ""soul"" version is a little strange but I still enjoyed it."
3,It was ok,"I have all of EJD's books and I was definitely not impressed with this one. It actually took me a little over a week to finish it which is unheard of with me and my beloved EJD books. I actually haven't been feeling him much with his newest efforts(with the exception of Naughty or Nice) but I still buy them in hardcover out of loyalty and because a bad EJD book is better than a whole lot of other garbage out there that's disguised as ""good"" fiction.All in all, I enjoy the way he updates us of old characters by mentioning them in his newest books, but I hope his stoyrlines get better."
3,Good Solid Escapism,"JAN. 2005Syracuse, New YorkI consider EJD to be a good trash writer for black fiction and not much more, but I do have to say that he is getting better at what he does.This one is slick, sexy and a good pageturner for when you don't want to stretch your mind too hard. I recommend it."
1,YOU WILL GO CRAZY!!,"The main character name ""Driver"" is the only interesting point driven in the book. I had to force myself to continue in order to seeif you was going to drive home a point. It didn't happen. There are too many characters with animal ""names"". Male characters are not your strong point. You seem to know more about women. You try too hard to made men so manly until you miss how sentitive they can be. Jerome under acknowledgements, you foreget to mention your best, best work ""The Other Woman"". How could you forget that book. You have a lot of work to out do the ""The Other Woman"". Now get going! You can't just sell books because you are ""Jerome"". You did the same thing with Naughty N Nice, whatever it was called. A waste. So my advise to the readers as I told my family and friends, DON'T BUY!!"
2,It's not the EJD that I know & love,"I am listening to this on CD while driving and so far, except for the part when he went to Rufus for medical help, this is a thumbs down. The reader has a great reading voice but the story rambles on and on with needless minute details. Often I hear a new character's name and wonder,""where did HE/SHE come from?""This is a 7 CD set and each CD has 99-100 tracks! I thought the first one would NEVER end. It does pick up after Rufus is introduced and I've paid for and will listen to the rest, but Theives Paradise it's not."
2,Better luck next time,"After Naughty or Nice, I was expecting this book to be the greatest thing. It was very confusing, jumped around too much and had too much unnecessary drama. I did not connect with any of the characters because there was too much mystery surrounding them. The book did not convey anything to me at all, I usually read his books in a couple hours, but I found myself struggling to keep this one open. I think the characters should have been developed a little more, and the true meaning of the book shoud have come out in the end. When I was finished reading it, I just did not know what I had read. Better luck next time."
3,Just OK,"I thought it was just me, but after reading some of the other reviews, I see that a lot of readers felt the same way I did. This book was hard to follow and if I wasn't reading it for my book club, I would have put it down. However, I did complete it and the ending was actually pretty good. I'm a little surprise at EJD, but I will cotinue to read his work. We can't do great all the time. Keep them coming!"
4,Should be made into a movie!,"Once again EJD doesn't disappoint his fans. ""Drive me crazy"" is full of twists,turns and excitment. Not to mention the unique writing style that EJD brings along with his original jargon.EJD fans will also notice reapperances from characters from some of his other books. Panther from ""Naughty or Nice"" is reincarnated as the love interest for Driver the main character of this book. David Lawrence from ""The other Woman"" is mentioned a few times. Pam from ""Thieves Paradise"" also make a few cameo apperances.Driver is in all actuality a nice guy. He goes the extra mile for his family and because of this the rest of his life is affected. But in the end Driver is well compensated for his actions and realizes who truly has his heart and loves him. This book is definitely move material."
3,Eh...,"I liked this book but it wasn't all that.Not a real page turner for me. It would have to be my 3rd least favorite of EDJ's books. Its not worse than Between Lovers, but its not better than Theives Paridise. It just wasnt realistic to me. But alot of his books (Cheaters, The Other Woman, Milk in My Coffee) are classified as favorites. But I would never turn away one of his books. Believe that!"
3,EJD has changed...,"And I'm not so sure how I feel about it. I first read and fell deaply in love with EJD about 6 months ago and since I've read all his books (except for Genevieve which I'm reading now) and I have to say this one and the two before it have not reached the level that I have come to expect of him. I fell in love with EJD because of the depth of his characters, his skill in writing female voices, how relatable his plots are, his shocking twists and his ability to keep me up all night reading. These last books have not been doing it for me. In Drive Me Crazy there were too many twists, too many unrealistic situations and it read really slow. If any other author would have written this book I would say it was good but for EJD to have written it I can only say that it was alright. Good for someone who has never read EJD, but as someone who has read all his work I'm not impressed and I know that he can do better."
2,Too raw for me,I did not enjoy this story; It was filled with violence. There were plenty of twists and turns for readers who love a who done it.
3,Well....,"Chasing Destiny, The other Woman, Naughty or Nice.... all amazing books. When I ordered the boo I was excited to read another EJD book and I could hardly wait to get my hands on this book. With all the other books I have red I would complete them in two to three days sitting hours at the time just reading. I ordered this book over 3 weeks ago and im still not half done. EJD is a fantastic writer but there is/was just something about this book that just didnt keep my attention like the others. Im not giving up on EJD I'll try to finish the book but if i cant I'll just put it on the shelf with the rest of my collection and grab another EJD book that I havnt read yet"
4,Good Job,"This book has keep my interest just as all his others. However the story line was a little bit different from what I am use to from Mr Dickey, but it was still a good book."
1,Fake Mickey Spillane schlock,"This was my first EJD book and it will most certainly be my last. For a work of fiction to be engaging, the characters either need to be people you can relate to or people with which you can empathize. EJD provided neither. Unrealistic chatacters (what man with Driver's vocabulary would refer to the police as, ""Po-po,"" what multi-millionaire's wife would work in his limo company as a driver and what person becomes a multi-millonaire with a limo fleet of five cars, even if he does come from a slightly wealthy background?), gratuitous sex scenes, unbelievably cliched dialogue and an improbable ending make this an awful novel."
5,1 of EJD's best!!!,This is one of EJD best books! He kept you want more and I read the book in a day and a half! The book is great pick it up if you haven't bought this yet! My daughter's is now reading!Thanks EJD keep up your great work!!JReed in Los Angeles
4,You go EJD!,"It was alot of pages in this book, and I just couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what was going to happend to ""Driver"". But you know who got the last laugh. People can be so cruel when it comes to having money, and Lisa found out the hard way. Great book, kept me reading and reading."
1,driving me crazy,I have never received the book driving me crazy by Eric Jerome Dicky. ThereforeI cannot review it. Please research and find out why I have not received it.Thanks.
2,Drove Me Crazy,"What. Is. With. The. One. Word. Sentences. Yes, I know it's done to create impact and drama, but towards the end, this was overused and annoying. As it was, it took nearly half the book to even have a sense of caring for any of the characters, but I definitely didn't need EJD's constant reminder of the 'drama' unfolding through his one-word sentence technique. Finally, as the story started to truly hit some high points, it abruptly came to an end. And yes I also get the reasoning for its sudden end, yet I still expect more from EJD, not just his commitment to the genre he's writing about. Maybe I'm just more inclined to his earlier books, I didn't like Thieves' Paradise either."
3,okay,I have enjoyed some of his other books better than this one. I found it took a little twist from his normal writings. I more into his books on relationships this had a little bit of crime mixed into it. Over all it was a good read.
5,Kept Me Wondering........,"I LOVED Drive Me Crazy! I've read all of EJD's books, this book reminded me of Thieves Paradise (which was my least favorite) but this made up for it!! It was edgy and kept me wondering what would happen to the main character! I love the way this man writes!!!"
3,A good read. Kept my attention,"Over the course of a week, I read three Eric J Dickey books. Whew!! Drive Me Crazy was the first. I enjoyed this book and though the story line was ""far out there"". It was unbelievable but an enjoyable read. There were two plot lines in the book that didn't seem to have much to do with the other. I guess EJD wanted to give the main character a way out. The characters were likeable and the author made me care about them. I applaud EJD for introducing complex African American characters."
3,Just Okay,"I never really liked the main character. I couldn't relate to what was going on in the story. I couldn't understand the decision-making processes of the characters at all. I felt like the author was reaching for big words to impress the reader. I felt like the placement of crossword puzzles in the book to incorporate big words to make the character seem smart, even though he's an ex con, was kitschy. I enjoyed the accurate references to Atlanta and Los Angeles. I give it 3 stars and will move on to another book."
3,Not What I'm Used to,"This book was not what I expected from EJD, in fact I expected a whole lot better. It wasn't as good as his first books (Cheaters, Milk In My Coffee) Hope the next one is better."
1,JUST STRIP CLUBS-NOT EXACTLY THE TOPS ONES!,"This book is about strip-clubs, just strip clubs. Anyone can go to 100 strip clubs and write about them. I happen to know some very elegant and well known strip clubs that are not mentioned in this book, so I was not impressed."
1,WHAT!? NO NATIVE AMERICAN ART?,"Was looking up 'Native American Art', and this came up! What is Amazon thinking! ! It may be out there, but I was not thinking about this kind of 'ART'!"
1,"Poor book, lacks the reality of the srtipping scene","I have been a stripper for the past 6 years and I can honestly say this is a stupid book. The author does nothing to depict the truth. Yes, he talks about different clubs, explains different dances and talks about the patrons, but the book tells nothing about the drugs, alcohol and sex that is so common among strippers."
4,"Goth Witch, indeed.","Although Band of Pain is wonderfully composed in the style of neo-industrio-ethereal-ambient...And Theatre of Hate is a strikingly well-versed and exquisite example of where ""Goth"" has been evolving for the past 15 years...And although these two artists are magnifique in their particular genres of musique...I fail to see what either hath to do with ""Goth Witch"" in any sense, as Goth Witches are not satannic or any of the other silly setian nonsense that Goths are stereotypically portrayed as in movies.The music on this compilation is very very good. But The compilation is sorely mislabeled.Eternally,Nikolai^^O^^GothWitches, Inc."
4,The samples for this CD are wrong...,"I think the other reviewer listened to the samples above which aren't right. I have no idea what the listing above is for, but it isn't the Goth Witch Project. The samples are for some other CD and not even a goth one.This CD set has a good mix of the old, like Sex Gang Children, with the new like Suspiria. It isn't the best goth rock out there, but it is a good selection and well priced for someone wanting to listen to a lot of bands for less money.I really enjoy bands like Theatre of Hate and 13 Candles, who are featured here. Please don't listen to the samples above to decide, since they aren't even the same CD. Maybe you can search the bands and find samples on iTunes or their websites. Maybe someone on Amazon can fix this problem! :)"
5,Spectacular reveal of Prescription World,It is a good consequence of freedom of the press that such books as this are able to be printed. The content of this book is well worth reading.
2,Long-winded and obnoxiously idealistic,"There are some great anecdotes in this book, and some critical points about how doctors are generally ignorant of evidence-based medicine and are pressured by patients, HMOs, and pharma companies to continue their expensive and inappropriate prescribing habits. However, the writing style serves as a cheap Ambien for even the most ambitious reader. Additionally, the ""solutions"" offered up to fix the US healthcare system are very (as can be expected from a Harvard man) ivory-tower, and disregard the thousands of big and little motivators throughout the healthcare political-industrial-financial complex that virtually ensure the US system will be entrenched until everyone is loaded to the gills with Viagra, Prozac, and unnecessary antibiotics while the great lifesaving classics of pharmaceuticals, such as thiazide diuretics, are virtually ignored."
3,"A superb review of the real world of medicines, medicine, the FDA, and big Pharma",Dr. Avorn has done a magnificant job of explaining the extremely complex world of drugs and drug development. His nuanced approach illustrates that there are no simple solutions. Each chapter is truly a masterpiece of analysis.I have read several books on drug development and the FDA and this is undoubtedly the best.
4,The Story Of A Spirited Woman Who Refuses To Give Up On Life,"A touching, sensitive, Australian film about an elderly woman dying of cancer (played by 78 year old actress Sheila Florance who knew she was dying of cancer when the film was being made) who has lost none of her joie de vivre and continues to live life to the fullest without the smallest hint of self-pity for her future death, which she knows is imminent.The marvelous thing about this film is watching Florance's cheerful disposition, while those around her wear long faces. Through flashbacks, we see the tragedy of her past life; and in the present, the resignation of the other old people living in her apartment building who once led formerly productive, vigorous lives, but have now given up. She never gives up and this strength inspires much younger people------who only grudgingly tolerate her-----to admire her strength and see older people in a different way. This used to be referred to as a ""small film"" but with great feeling behind it."
3,new ekco pot,I love the pot. It cooks great and nothing sticks. it cam with a few scratches on the outside. I still do like the way the pot cooks and the size is perfect.
5,Great Item,"Don't know why they use the term 'Bulk'...There are Six (6) in the package.Small but effective. Lightweight but strong.Well made and includes short, reflective lanyards.Very pleased with my purchase. I am ordering another set next week.A full dozen will will give me enough to stake out my tent and rain fly.Note: These serve 'double duty'. I store these by weaving them throughthe molle webbing on my pack and the webbing on my molle attached pouches.Although they don't actually take up much pack volumn, storing them inthis manner removes one more item from the limited interior space andmore securely attaches my additional external items.Note: As Always, I compared prices with many toher sites. In addition to being comparably priced,Amazon prime meant free 2 day shipping."
4,Good quality Carbon.,"I have used the Matrix carbon for the past 3 years in both freshwater and reef aquariums. It does a nice job keeping the water nice and clean. I use about 1 cup per 20 gallons in a mesh bag. You could use more or less depending on your bioload in the aquarium. The carbon should be placed in a area with high flow to make it work effectively at removing ""stains"" in the water. You can find low ash carbon for aquariums but it is very expensive. Also try the seachem ""the Bag"" as your mesh bag it is awesome... be sure to rinse the carbon prior to placing in the aquarium water."
4,Good for any space-shooter,"The music contained within this CD is perfect for anyone who enjoys listening to their own CDs while playing computer games, such as Quake/Q2 and X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter. Just pop the CD into your player and crank it up! Excellent driving beats for all those violent, gore-soaked, splatter-house, quality family entertainent games. Toast that Rebel scum to the tunes of ""Stray Bullet,"" and rip that red team-member a new one with ""Mercy."" Poppin' zombies is a snap with ""Gravitation Zero,"" and ""Cloning Technology,"" lends a helping hand to raise your blood-lust on Deathmatch."
2,Conventional thriller displaying the author's ignorance,"Though captivating in parts, the author's lack of knowledge concerning even the basics of physics (miniature nuclear devices hidden in computers! Aw, come on!), history, Japan and the Japanese, and his inability to shake off his all-pervasive American-centered view of the world, belie his professed attempt - in which he takes great pride - to offer an insider expert's view of Japanese society. Although Hiatt pokes a lot of fun at other so-called ""expert opinions"", ultimately he himself turns out to be not much better. As an aside: the contrived and therefore unwittingly hilarious sequence of events leading to the two protagonists finally having sex must be seen to be believed.Senior journalists need not necessarily turn out be good novel authors, as this book conclusively demonstrates."
5,Worth the wait....,Still waiting for a digitally remastered directors cut on DVD or blueray. Will be worth the wait....
4,Great Movie but.....,... The movie is good but unless you speak vietnamese you will be lost some of the time. I don't understand why this was left out it's in the original and when it's shown on TV it has the Sub-titles. I did not find any mention that the video did not have them....This should be noted somewhere so the consumer knows that it has been altered.
4,Firebase Gloria,"I bought a USED copy that included the subtitles---this isimportant to help see the other side. Complaints of Filipinosplaying ""CONG"" are irrelevant---they are fighters make no mistakeabout it.The dialogue is VERY realistic,also scenes of potsmokersand guys laughing while blowing people up may seem farfetched--I am sure these things happened EXACTLY that way.AS low budgetas things were---the point gets across---war is a terrible thingfor all involved.If you lived during the Vietnam era-you knowthe stigma that was placed upon OUR fighting men---most unfortunate when you consider a lot of them went thru the traumasthat are shown in this movie.No matter what your personal politics may have been about Vietnam--watching this movie shouldmake you think TWICE about recriminations for those that werethere---either by chance or choice. I am sure they wanted to besomewhere else! I am greatful that I wasnt. They have alwayshad my respect."
5,The best Vietnam war movie ever made,"I love this movie. It starts slowly but builds in intensity, ending with a climactic battle for a fire base overrun during the Tet offensive. It shows a realistic depiction of the horror and brutality of the Vietnam war and the courage of those who were there. One thing that sets this movie apart for me is that it shows the conflict from the perspective of the V.C. without any anti-U.S. military, liberal propaganda. Check it out for yourself."
2,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.","This is a cheap imitation war movie, which is poorly made. The fight scenes are poorly done, for the most part, and obviously feature Filipinos trying to look Vietnamese in a lot of scenes. The acting is at best, barely acceptable. Even R. Lee Ermey, who is a very good actor, can't carry this film on his shoulders by himself. Some action scenes are pretty good, especially when a young soldier gets bayoneted by two enemy soldiers. Very well acted by the newcomer. For the most part, though, it's a cheap rehash of every other war picture about the Vietnam War."
1,Terrible movie,"I just finished watching the movie. What a waste of time that was. The movie is full of historical inaccuracies. I won't even go into the military inaccuracies. You would think that a movie starring R. Lee Ermey would have not had such glaring screw ups. The acting is awful, but I suppose that should be expected when the ""star"" of the movie is Wings Hauser. Others have left reviews comparing to or claiming it better than Platoon or Apocalypse Now. I find those comparisons absolutely stunningly wrong! Save your money and time and move on to something else."
1,The worst war movie I have ever seen,"This is truly the worst war movie I have ever seen, possibly the worst ever made. Practically every cliche of the genre is trotted out and poorly done. There is not the slightest trace of realism in the action scenes, in showing how troops move or execute tactics, in portaraying how the chain of command works or in showing how different branches of the service interact. The Vietnamese don't even look like Vietnamese. As a veteran, I find it amazing that anyone who was in Viet Nam could see this film as anything but ridiculous. On the other hand, I did watch the entire movie with morbid fascination, just to see how low things would go. If had been even a little better, I probably wouldn't have lasted half an hour."
1,"Terrible, low-budget, no-acting shoot-'em-up","This may be the worst Vietnam film of all time.This had to be LOW-budget, and we get what they paid for! The acting is non-existent, except for some strong character from Lee Ermey (who was better in ""Full Metal Jacket""). The Vietnamese were clearly (and poorly) played by Filipinos who seemed miscast. The human wave attacks were woefully unrealistic. If you like to sit back and listen to gunshots and watch bodies pile up mindlessly, you might give this a second star....""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" all have much more compelling storylines and quality acting. And the even-earlier ""The Green Berets"" (with John Wayne) was better in most respects.I am surprised this is an ""exclusive""... it should be ""excluded"" instead."
3,HA HA HA !!!,"This is defintely a B-grade movie when a company of VC with AK-47's and a squad of GIs with M-16's stand 10 paces away in full view of eachother during broad daylight, then fire away on full automatic for minutes on end.Probally the highest body count of any movie ever made!Rambo, eat your heart out!!"
5,Best Movie of Vietnam Era,"I first saw this movie on HBO 20 years ago or so, still the best movie of the Vietnam War. While the acting is a little weak, the characters are believable and the storyline is tight. Lee Ermey gives a typical tough marine SGM performance, Wings Hauser is strong, Mark Neely and Gary Hsershberger give stong supporting performances. Hope this comes out in DVD sometime"
4,Ermey in good.,"A very good flick. Not as good as ""Full Metal Jacket' but well worth the cost. Lee R. Ermey is one of the toughest nu*busters to ever grace a movie screen. He is the ultimate Combat Flick character actor. Tough as nails and mean as a snake. See this one."
5,worth the wait,"I was excitied to see this great viet nam era movie finally out on DVD, it took a long time but was worth the wait. One of the best movies about the Viet Nam war--lots of action and great story.Great movie for a collection!"
5,Excellent Vietnam War Depiction,"Out of all the movies I've ever seen about the Vietnam war, this one has got to be the best; even better than Full Metal Jacket in my opinion, but that was excellent as well. Ermey once again does his roll perfectly as a tough, determined SOB. Great flick!"
3,This movie captures the essence of the Marine Corps Spirit,"A remote Army firebase in Vietnam faced with inevitable overun by VC forces finds itself in the command of A battle worn Marine Staff NCO. The VC throw everything they have at this firebase day after day and the wily Marine refuses to give in, or let anyone else give in. He wins the respect of the surviving soldiers and the VC commander. Outstanding Flick"
4,ANOTHER GREAT ERMEY SHOWCASE.,"FIREBASE GLORIA stands in kind with John Carpenter's great ASSAULT ON PCT. 13: It is was mislabeled and passed off as B-movie fluff. While some of the dialogue is hokey, there's enough good to compensate: R. Lee Ermey with yet another showcase performance, the under rated Wings Hauser, and a solid story of impending doom told without gloss. Sidney J. Furie should have jumped at the chance to make this one his final piece of a Vietnam Trilogy."
4,Simple is sometimes Better....,"As is the case with this move Siege of Firebase Gloria. As I sat down to watch this movie, my father, who is a Vietnam Vet having served 2 tours, also sat down to watch it with me. What amazed me about this was that he rarely sat down to watch movies about the Vietnam War. When he did he was usually disappointed and never saw them through. After the movie he told me that it was a GREAT movie and about time someone got it [...] near right. Aside from the fact that I truly enjoyed this movie. His comment was all the critique I needed to rush out and purchase this movie for my private collection. I only wish they would release this on DVD. My advice to those who wish to purchase or rent it, ensure you get a version with subtitles, without the subtitles you only get half the story."
3,Missing Subtitles Hurts this VHS Version,I finally got a chance to watch my Firebase Gloria VHS I purchased on Amazon.com. While the quality was good I was disappointed that it was not wide screen. Since it was formatted to fit the screen the subtitles were cut off and you cannot follow the Vietnamese dialog. It is bad because you miss valuable insight into the movie. Having seen the movie on TNT with subtitles I know that there are many pieces to the story missing since you cannot follow what goes on with the Vietnamese. Anyway it would have been nice to know before the purchase. The Siege of Firebase Gloria with Lee Ermy is a good movie. I think Lee Ermy is a great actor and I think the fact that he was a Marine gives his Marine characters a lot of depth and realism. He can also do non-Marine movies and he does a fantastic job. Check him out is Mississippi Burning.
2,DOES NOT FIT STANDAR BIKE POSTS,SPECS ARE FINE BUT ONE MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT THE MOUNTING RING DOES NOT FIT STANDARD BIKE POSTS. BOUGHT TWO. RETURNED ONE AND THE OTHER I MOUNTED TO LESS THAN DESIRABLE PART OF BIKE FRAME.
4,A quirky fascinating book,"This is a quirky but fascinating book. A must for any collector or aficionado of the Colt Single Action Army. The scholarship behind the book is somewhat questionable. David Brown deduces the calibre from what the Colt shipping records say, but the shipping record usually echoes the customer order. Thus Brown presents 44 Russian, 44 S&W Russian and 44 S&W as distinct chamberings. But they are the same chambering, just different styles of nomenclature in the Colt ledgers. Before 1907, 44 Russian and 44 S&W meant the same thing. After 1907, 44 Special and 44 S&W meant the same thing. But that aside, the book is a great buy and is recommended to any serious Colt collector."
1,Caution-Intel has discontinued production/support,I checked the Intel website-all PocketConcert players have been discontinued. Intel will no longer support the player.
4,Great product but the headphone jack stinks,I received this mp3 player as a Christmas gift and I love it. My only gripe is that when I put the headphones into the jack I have to place the headphones into the jack ever so carefully so I can get perfect reception. If I don't do it right sometimes I only get sound in one side of the headphones. It is very easy to install and transfer music to. Sound quality is excellent once the headphones are placed in the jack properly. Unfortunately I think I'm going to have to return it for another one. Hope I have better luck with the next one.
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,I bought this product a year and a half ago and so far have had to cash in on the warranty 3 times to get a replacement player. This was not after hard use- more like taking it to the gym 3 or 4 times. This product is a lemon- no wonder Intel is getting out of the business!
4,Almost Perfect,"Handy, dandy, easy to you, this is the best MP3 player I have ever seen. It holds up to as many as 35 full songs, and it sounds like a dream. Headphones are weird, but you get used to them eventually. The only bad thing is the radio. It vitually is useless indoors. Other than that, this is a good item."
1,"""Volume increase"" button failed-- no support","As others have mentioned in their reviews of this product, the buttons fail; mine was the ""volume increase"" button. I contacted support and was immediately told this problem required replacement; Intel is well aware of the problem. However, when we determined I bought the unit 14 months ago (12 month warranty), I was refused support beyond instructions on how to take the unit apart and fix it myself. After experiencing their level of support, and reading others' comments in support of my experience, I strongly recommend against buying this item."
1,Warranty= 12 months / Life expectancy= 14 months,"I bought this relatively expensive toy for my sons birthday, only to have it completely fail after fourteen months. Intel's support tells me ""unfortunately we do not offer an extended warranty on this product. If you would like to try to fix it yourself...."" Prior to this I was told there was no way to fix it and it would have to be replaced. I recommend against buying their product."
1,Intel Pocket Audio Play,"This product is not made anymore but I am writing this review in case anyone ever thinks of buying this mfgr's product. This player was purchased as a Christmas gift but never worked. We tried to replace, return but all of our efforts were thwarted after one initial, lame excuse of help from intel. Amazon was no help at the time (several years ago) although I am sure they are much better now."
5,Basic mouse,"I've used this mouse for 6+ years and it's only recently been giving me problems (loss in clicking sensitivity). I'm picking up another one to replace it. If you just need a basic mouse with no frills (besides a scroll wheel), then this one will suit you fine. Great price point too. Who wants to spend $50 on a mouse?"
5,love it!,my 3 year old loves this show. he watches it over and over. very cute! kids can learn a lot from this show!
1,"Great show, but lousy amount of content...","...four ten-minute episodes and ""Running time approx 66 minutes""?? (And btw Amazon, it says 60 on the box - you're both wrong but just fyi).Just don't give these guys 'Number World'.Four useful words - THE EXTRAS DON'T COUNT! Sid the Science Kid is infinitely better value at 150 Mins ""plus bonus content"".How come NCircle Entertainment (who released both) can get away with being so inconsistent? Do PBS have no say in this whatsoever?Will just record them on the hard-drive in future."
3,no dancing dog video!,"We love WordWorld in general and were happy to buy this dvd, but HUGE disappointment that it says on the box that the Music Video is ""Dancing Dog"" and it turns out it is NOT. The video is one with Pig in it. Of all the ones to choose from I bought this one because my daughter loves the tap dancing dog part, where they build their instruments then play as a band - she gets out her play drum - Wondering which disc actually has ""Dancing Dog""?"
4,Great for older kids!,"My son seemed to like Word World, however he is only 17 months and I don't think he is getting too much out of it yet. I think it will be great to pull out again later when he is older and knows his letters better."
4,good for preschoolers,"I have a 7 year old and 4 year old. The 7 year old has only watched it twice but the 4 year old seems to like it pretty well. Glad I bought it, but not sure I will buy any more from WordWorld will probably try something different. All in all I think it is pretty good for preschoolers."
2,I expected that the bag to be of a bluish colour.,The displayed colour of the bag is misleading. I expected it to be a bluish colour but instead it is black (or very dark grey). I was specifically looking for a coloured bag. Now I am restarting the search for one elsewhere.
3,Nice but I wish it was bigger.,"I bought this to replace my backpack since someone told me I looked like a school kid and I wanted a more professional look. It is very clean looking and professional but I was hoping for more space. It will definitely fit a 17"" laptop but that's about it. The smaller front pockets are decent but I would have liked to have seen a pen holder instead of storage for a flash drive or CD pockets (who carries CD's anymore). I really like the small pockets on the flap cover. Great place to store your cell and loose change when flying and running through security check. Last but not least, the shoulder strap is a bit on the short side. I am 6'1"" and I have it extended it all the way. It also could have used a better pad. If anyone can recommend a bag with a nice comfy strap I am all ears. Why won't manufacturers spend more money on the strap. It's the most important part."
4,"Nice bag, but with some minor problems","I actually expected little more quality from Microsoft bag. When you close the bag and look at it from sides while holding, you will notice some uneven position. The from will look bulky. Otherwise it is a good bag."
1,Deceptive bait and switch,"Amazon images of this product are misleading. The shoulder strap attachment system depicted in the image are much more sturdy and well made in the image than in the shipped item.I am amazed at the obvious deception on the product. A primary reason that I considered this item was the fact that the strap attachment would be secure, but the actual strap is a cheap, flimsy insecure clip. There is no way I would consider carrying a computer in this case while riding my bike, which had been my plan."
4,Solid and Straightforward,"I am an avid Amazonian and tend to be in the school of knowing what I want before I even start looking. As such I often get recruited to find/purchase things for an increasingly large group of people who do not care about learning what needs to learned in order to be happy with their purchases.This Laptop messenger bag is great for 17inch laptop that simply need to be taken from point A to point B, with little concern about the ergonomics or any specific performance criteria. A simple straightforward. construction quality seems to be on par with other Microsoft branded items I have encountered over the years. And is holding up well through the last several months of use.There are better items if you need specific volume requirements or physically performance attributes."
5,Wonderful Bag,"I got this bag because I am a student/professional and I don't care for the look of a traditional bookbag on my back when I am going to work. I was reading reviews about different messenger bags and this one stuck out to me. The key things that I was looking for in a bag was storage space and compartments. This bag has plenty of both. The textbooks for my classes are fairly large (about 2-3 inches thick) and this bag can fit 2 of those books and a notebook as well as my umbrella for rainy days, lint brush, deodorant, handsanitizer, about 15-20 pens, etc. I love the look of the bag and something about the orange interior just goes well with the leather. Of course, as most messenger bags do, it doubles as my laptop case in which case I can still have one of 2 of my really thick books. Overall, I am very pleased with it and the price is very fair."
2,I'm supposed to fit a 17 inch laptop in this?,"I ordered a new laptop that hasn't come in yet but I realized my old bag wasn't big enough as I was going from a 15.6 inch to a 17 inch laptop, so I ordered this as it advertises as being able to hold up to a 17.3 inch laptop. I don't see how in the world it's going to do that. My 15.6 inch laptop fits tight in there. There's no way I can see a 17 inch laptop fitting inside this thing. I'm also disappointed in the way the compartments are distributed. Most of the pockets are barely big enough to hold what it's supposed to hold. Really not impressed with this going to look to return it."
1,Great utility - terrible quality construction!,"I loved everything about this bag, for about 2 weeks. Then the material started to fray from the edge binding, any area that I used to capacity. First, was the water bottle holder. I only used a small bottle. Then I noticed the fraying, so I stopped using that pouch. A few weeks later, the fraying began on the main back panel around the corners; and from there it just got worse, so I returned it to the store. Too bad, I loved the front pouch - perfect for MP3 player. This is a well designed, bag except for the quality of the construction."
4,Doesn't fit Toshiba's 17.3 inch sreen!!,"It's a really nice bag, but online it said it was for a 17.3 inch screen. I just bought a new Toshiba 17.3 inch screen laptop and it doesn't fit!! The tag on the bag says it fits ""most 17 inch screens"", so I think online it was kind of deceiving. Then there's another tag on the same bag that says the device should be 15.5 inches. I don't understand why this has become so confusing for the customer!"
3,ok,is not really a 90 minute charger. takes 2.1 hours. says on back of box. save a couple bucks and buy the 2 or 4 hour charger. wish i wouldve.
3,Do not buy it with batteries included,I purchased two of these together with 4 AA batteries. Both battery sets (total of 8 AA)are not functional. When inserted for charging indicators showed charging process started. After 10 minutes it showed that batteries were fully charged. I put tehm in the camera and after 10 shots (5 minutes)camera turned off. I tried to recharge them again but the same happened. I repeated process with another set of 4 batteries and the same thing happened. I would consider it was bad luck with first set but with two sets i consider this as cheating customers. The charger worked when I inserted old batteries from another camera. I'll be able to say more about charger when buy a new rechargeable batteries and try it again. DO NOT BUY LENMAR 2500mAh NICKEL-METAL HYDRIDE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES
2,Lenmar charger and batteries,Lenmar charger is marginal. Batteries supplied are also - they don't charge up well or last very long. I'm disappointed in the entire set.
5,FAST AND IT WORKS!,THE LENMAR MACH 3 BROKE... so i went with this... BOOM! PERFECT and more compact since its plug is built in!
1,Don't buy this,Totally unsatisfactory. I wanted batteries charged for digital camera.It never worked - would not charge battery at all.Save your money.
1,These suck,for some reason only two of the batteries will charge. the light never seems to indicate that they are fully charged. they also pop out easily as if they don't actually fit into the charger. i'm gonna stick with eneloop.
4,"Not bad, but not great either","This was an ok book. I enjoyed the main characters and their personalities. I was expecting a little more action and suspense considering it's labeled as such, but there just didn't seem to be a lot of it. It's a decent read, just don't pay full price for it. Won't be going in my permanent collection."
3,Irene and Tatum pair well as first adversaries then friends.,"The first film that Irene did after ""Fame"", being a fan of both stars, you will enjoy this film. Despite holes in the plot, the two stars give good performances. Irene as rich daddy's girl looking for attention and Tatum as poor girl looking to survive they make you believe in both of their struggles."
1,Vanity of vanities,"Pul Celluci tells us about his family, everyone he ever knew in politics and elsewhere and even the cars that he has driven. He faithfully represented George W. Bush and his misguided policies as Ambassador to Canada. I suppose that that is what an Ambassador is supposed to do, but this guy is no diplomat. Canadians can, up to a point, have their own policies and he sure rubbed them the wrong way."
1,Two units DOA,"I bought one unit and spent 2 hours trying to get it to work. Caled KDS, they told me it was because I was using a USB mouse and keyboard so I moved to my laptop with no other USB devices and same problem. An hour on with tech support, we finally determined it was an alignment problem with the sensors that tell the motor where to stop. Exchanged it for another one, this one the motor wouldn't stop running. I was looking forward to using this device to save me a lot of time, instead it wasted the better part of a day, time to go to the alternative offered by CyberGuys."
2,Software doesn't work with XP,I could get the software to work with Windows XP. No link or support on the KDS web site. Will return unit tomorrow if no solution is found.
1,KDS not interested in long-term customers,"I spoke with customer service rep at 800-283-1311. Devices have a one-year warranty. I stated that I sent in the Registration card, and asked if she would look up the purchase date. She said no, ""Registration and Warrany are in different departments.""She asked me to hold, and came back on the line stating that since this model originally sold in 2003, my unit went off warranty in 2004 unless I have the invoice. I called back about an hour later, after finding the invoice, and got the same customer service rep. She recognized me and belittled me for calling back and said unless I have a question, there's nothing they can do. I stated that I found the invoice as requested and she asked me to fax it to her. I did that, so far no response. We'll see if they replace the unit or not.Just an FYI...after the one-year warranty, there are no options. The do not offer parts or service after the one-year warranty."
3,No software support,"The device works Ok. I'm using it to store MSDN DVDs. The software has some bugs. I sent an e-mail to the tech. support and their response was: ""Unfortunately Version 4.02 is the latest software released and also the last"".You can also check http://www.itechcds.com/ for an alternative device."
1,KDS CDO Not Ready for Prime Time,"I purchased two CDOs only to find out that some of the lights on one of them did not work. After 6 weeks, KDS finally replaced it. It did not cost me anything but time and frustration. After 2 months, my second one has now failed. Most of the trays do not eject. It is no longer returnable and I have CDs stuck in it. Do NOT make the mistake of purchasing even one of these. Go to K-Mart and get one of the old fashioned manual ones. You will be much happier."
1,"Nice at First, then a big Nightmare!!!! Destroyed CDs","This unit when it came out was a great idea. But has one big, big flaw. All your CD will be useless after a short time as it warps everyone of them. There is no center support for the CDs like a CD case has. Be warned. Stick to organizers that either stand the CDs on there edge, or are supported by the center ring of the CD if they are to be laying horizontal."
4,No problems here!,"I read reviews of the organizer in Maximum PC several months back & decided that I needed one. Well, I finally got around to purchasing it & it's exactly as I hoped! I got to throw away all my empty CD cases that are just taking up space. The database software isn't pretty, but it gets the job done. I didn't have any installation or operational problems with it & WinXP, although it does tack on about 30 seconds to my boot time -- small price to pay for losing about 50 pounds of plastic CD cases!"
1,SOFTWARE UPDATE NEEDED,"Can someone PLEASE send me the link to download the newest software for this @#^$$ organizer? I've written KDS twice in the past month and have not received a response. I'm running XP and from what I can tell, the update will fix the problems I'm having."
5,Almost indescribable,Andy Compton is truly a deep house master. I would have to honestly say that EVERY SINGLE TRACK on this album has the groove that I always am looking for but can only rarely find. It's such a treat to find a whole album where each song has a special feeling which makes you feel like kicking back and just being social with Gin Tonic in hand and smiles all around. Keep the volume at 4 and a get together is suddently the hippest party around. Crank it to 9 and the place is completely off the hook.
5,Perfect for holding the actual hydrocollator pack.,These are very high quality terry cloth covers that are the perfect way to hold your hydrocollator pack safely and contain a lot of the steam that would escape if you only used towels. It's the steam that causes the heat treatment to work. You still need to wrap a towel or 2 around this cover to prevent a burn and excessive steam loss. Do not exceed 30 minutes with any hydrocollator treatment.
1,Very Misleading Photo and Wording,"Although I like the hydrocollator cover, when the vender displays a photo of TWO covers and words the advertisement as COVERS, a quick peruse would lead one to believe that there are two covers as displayed and as worded. It is only ONE cover. Very sly. I would not but from this vendor again unless they were to send to me the other cover, then change the photo and the wording to accurately reflect the purchase."
2,Perhaps it's better for hot packs...,"We purchased this to use with our cold pack (shaped just like this holder) but had to return it. The material was just too thick/padded for the cold to be ""felt"" much at all through the cloth. Perhaps it would work better for hot packs...However the construction quality and material were both quite good."
5,Just like my PT office,This product is exactly the same product that my Physical Therapy office uses after my PT exercises. It gives get deep moist heat on the muscles and joints. You must buy them together!
3,Great product but wording could be better in description,As a massage therapist of over 18 yrs. I have used hot packs many times and the covers are such an intagral part of treatment. When I made my purchase I thought that I was getting more than one cover due to the titleHOT PACK COVERS. That is my only negative comment.Hot Pack Covers - Standard Size - Terry Cover
2,hydroculator pack covers,"the covers seem to be to thick cant feel the heat pack threw them, dont think i would buy any more or refer to anyone"
3,Purchase,"All the items were not shipped and at the time of this writing, an item is still missing.Have that item shipped to Rodney Bitner, 4701 Archer Dr. Wilmington, NC 28409"
1,Silly mistakes,"This is the only Journalism textbook approved for high school use in my state. Unfortunately, it is not a dependable book. I have had to tell my students to ignore things the book says. For example, it spends a whole page telling students that a Zine is a webpage. Some misinformed person was allowed to write that page and nobody thought to check their sources. The organization of the book leaves much to be desired, and many lessons are unclear. I wish I had the option to use another book but bureaucracy rules."
4,"Excellent, very informative","Edward Keyes really paints a scenario of what Boston --and the world -- was like in the early 1940s. I am a baby boomer and have always relished my elders' stories of ""the good old days"", but he describes the ethical mores of the time, the fact that mail was delivered twice a day, that no woman EVER went out on the street without gloves and a hat, etc. And with that intro, he leads us into the tragic story of the Cocoanut Grove fire. I couldn't put it down."
3,Because there's no competition - it's worthwhile reading,"As far as I know, there are only two books on this subject and this is the better one. It's fascinating to learn the changes in medical care, emergency response and building codes that it brought about, but I was hoping for more detailed information on that. Someone could have written it better and more excitingly, but no one did."
3,Time has forgotten,A reasonably well-written account of one of the most diasterous nights in Boston's history. One of only two books available on this topic. There are no pictures.
2,Interesting enough.......,"....but this book is basically a rehash of the only other [and the BEST] book written about the fire, ""Fire in Boston's Cocoanut Grove;: Holocaust!"" by Paul Benzequin.Personally, I'd save my money, and check the Benzequin book out of the library."
5,Quickly became one of our favorite CDs,"We have had Boston Camarata albums (beginning with LPs) for many years, so we expected to like this, but it's even better than we had hoped. It won't be put away with the holiday albums in January; it will stay in the Early Music section to be enjoyed many times throughout the year."
3,For the eclectic taste....,"This selection is....well....interesting. Let me just say that I am a fan of previous Boston Camerata releases and also lived in Istanbul for several years. So, I'm used to the ""Eastern"" sounds. However, there wasn't much about this release that screamed ""Christmas"" to me. It was a bit hard to get into. Both my wife and I tried it several times but just found it too odd, disjointed, almost schizo. If you are a fan of Jordi Savall (and I am) or similar ""historical musicians"" then you may enjoy this. It consists of some vocal numbers interspersed with some spoken word interludes. At times it feels like some sort of arty performance piece at other times it feels like the soundtrack to some brooding, indy film release set in Morocco or the Middle East."
3,This is a repeat,"If you are a true Bobby Darin fan you already have all this, most of this DVD was already in ""The Mack is Back""."
4,Aces Back to Back,"Good selection of his works but I wish there had been more of HIS works instead of covers from his TV show. The same applies for the DVD portion. I would have left off ""Song Song Blue"" and some of the others and used footage of him doing his own music (A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square or I'm Begining to See the Light, for example) for a ""real"" audience instead of a TV studio audience. The Lost Documentary Footage was interesting to watch one time but I'll probably never watch it again. I'd have preferred the space be used for concert footage."
2,Concert performances back to back,"With little to no warning on the CD package, this CD is 100% concert performances. There is not one original recording in the whole thing. For a seasoned Bobby Darin fan, that may be just fine. But for people who are new to Bobby Darin (or any musician for that matter), you should never begin with concert performances, but with original recordings. That way the listener can get a feel for the singer and his songs. I wish I had done a little more homework before buying ACES BACK TO BACK. I wish I had purchased a Bobby Darin CD which featured only Bobby Darin, singing the songs he is best known for (although those songs are featured on this CD) and singing them the way he is best known for."
4,Chucke Baby... Soars,My first exposure to Chucke Baby and the All Stars was a concert in Scottsdale AZ in 2005. They quickly won over the crowd with their opener. Throughout the evening all band members seemed to enjoy performing and talking to the audience. After awhile people were up dancing and singing and getting into their set.Chuke's music is upbeat rock-n-roll but seasoned with excellent musicianship and sounds mature well beyond teeny-bopper. These guys are well beyond 20 years old and obviously enjoy their craft.They are pretty local but deliver first class music with a broad appeal. Combine this with there audience engaging performance and you hope they'll get a chance to make it internationally.
5,"Great musicians, Great music","It is so great to listen to a CD that has some real versatility to it. The tracks are soulful and powerful, with great hooks, and incredible melodies. I would recommend this CD only to those people who have a genuine appreciation for the craft of music making. What a collection of songs, and what a great group of musicians."
3,Korean War in Color,A good video of the Korean War but it was not worth the money. I have seen other Korean War videos just as good at a much more reasonable price.
3,"Well built, but 45W only!","On receipt, this turns out to be an Apple-label product; I assume that SmartDisk bought up Apple's surplus stock and is selling them here. It works perfectly, BUT!!! This is a 45 watt charger. That means it's not appropriate for newer 15"" and 17"" PowerBooks (which use a 65W charger). I can't find this information in the online description, so I thought I'd add it here.If you have an iBook or an older titanium PowerBook, order in confidence. If not... this will power your computer, OR charge it, but NOT both at the same time. Caveat emptor!"
1,DECEIVING...NOT THE ITEM DISPLAYED,"I bought this charger in June 2010, with hopes that i would receive a round-shaped apple-licensed charger. However, I received a knock-off no-name brand square-shaped replica of the original charger shipped with the Apple Powerbook G4. Although the item that shipped does the job, I was really disappointed in the customer service provided by the seller... They told me it was an ""amazon"" issue, not theirs, and I should be fine because the charger they sent works, doesnt it?"
2,Apple Powerbook AC Adapter,The item that I ordered is not the one that I received. I ordered SmartDisk ACG4 Adapter(circular) but I received a square in shape adapter and supposed to received also an adapter(AC plug for international use) but it's not included in the shipment. I wanted a full refund or send me the right item that i ordered.
3,Other options?,"What other options are there out there? Made by Apple, but it stills heats up during use....which leads me to think it will not last long."
3,Andalusian Gore Fest,"As a Creature Feature type film this movie is loved by some hated by many. Those who like their eyeballs a la' carte will especially enjoy this flick. Not for the squeamish as a few scenes are a little rank.Suprisingly, this movie actually has plot and back-story. Not elemnents always found in B-type films. All in all a gore fest for those who love the wiz-spread side of cinema."
5,Great Product,"The book like brand new and shipped very fast, I was impressed with this business.I would do business with them again."
3,MSB does the ocean... not as well as I'd hoped!,"I am a MSB fan and am trying to get my young children interested too. The Ocean was the first MSB software we got, and I'm afraid it will be the last. It's ok, but I'm disappointed that the software doesn't load correctly (on 3 different computers and 2 operating systems (win98, XP)! None worked right!). It will start, but it is very difficult to navigate the first few times until you ""learn"" where things are. Finding out where to go and what to click on is trial and error for the most part. Maybe I just haven't ""found"" the good stuff yet, but I was hoping for better!"
4,A wild romp,"Abrahams brings a lot of characters together in this character-driven novel. It moves very quickly and sometimes went in directions that surprised me. Once or twice the author overreached (the most notable example was what seemed like a physically impossible sex scene on horseback), but for the most part this was a fun read."
4,casino night at home,"Fun,fun,fun for the older family--not a young kids game but something the older 21+ can play at home without spending money"
5,Dragon Tamer,"Dragon Tamer is a must-read !It is so exciting, you can't put it down.Not only do you get to travel to Hong Kong, Mexico, and the Pacific West Coast, but the author also takes you on a journey through the dark world of drugs and the CIA.The main character, Blake Morgan, fights corruption while struggling with his own personal demons borne out of his childhood in a Prisoner of War camp.The characters are so well-developed, I hope to meet them again in another book."
4,Great intro to Techno/Electronica,"I am not a big fan of Techno or Electronica, but I love this album. If you saw the movie, you know how apporpriate some of these songs were to what was going on on-screen. If you want a good introduction to Techno or Electronica music, this album is a good place to start."
4,MUST,"I let a non-music minded friend borrow this CD to give her an idea of how many different techno sounds there are. Jungle, House, Acid- she loved it. It sort of inspired her to go out and get more. Now she dating a DJ and calls herself a club girl. It's not quite what I had in mind but it'll do. The movie kick's a** too."
1,Double check this item before you actually order!!!,"This item was misrepresented on Amazon marketplace. It is listed as the soundtrack to the movie ""Hackers"", but is actually a German collection of classical music. I don't know if this is some kind of joke being put on people trying to buy this album, but it makes me think twice now about buying CDs through Amazon."
3,"WHERE IS THE ''SUNDAYS"" SONG AT THE END?","I REALLY WANTED TO GET THAT ""SUNDAYS"" TUNE THEY PLAY AT THE END OF THE MOVIE!!! WHY ISN'T IT ON THE CD???"
1,Happy Times,What a disappointment this book proved to be. No real insights and certainly no new information about this shadowed sister or her famous relatives. Just endless pictures of Ms. Radziwill looking far away and dazed. Almost no pictures of 'you know who'. I returned it the same day I received it. The narrative is boring and the desire to understand this person better is very much left unsatisfied. Ms. Radziwill works so hard at maintaining her privacy that she fails to inform her readers of anthing that would be of real interest.
2,Fluff,"I was expecting a little more depth with this book. How she felt about different aspects of her life. This book barely glazes the surface of parts of history she participated in. The last eighteen pages are excerpts from One Special Summer, which I had just read, I was disappointed in the overall content. I know the title is HAPPY TIMES, I think she could have shown a little more dept about her HAPPINESS. I would like it, if Amazon would write a few lines about the book. Instead you have to wait until another person has read the book and writes a review."
1,NO SUBSTANCE - NO REAL INSIGHTS,I wish I could have given this book zero stars. I saw Lee Radziwill in a TV inerview when she was plugging her book - and - she offered no insights or substance then either. She was evasive with most questions and even avoided others. The book is so hyped and delivers nothing that we don't already know. I agree with some of the previous reviewers - the only reason people have bought this book is because Lee was Jackie's sister. Outside of that fact no one is really interested in Lee Radziwill's life.
2,don't spend the money,really a waste - i bought it for what insight it might have into the 60's time period and soley because she is jackie's sister - I've seen every photograph before and am not interested in photos of her homes. Her text offers no insight into anything and this is just a woman who hung around famous people - some of accomplishment - she herself offers nothing and reveals nothing of substance
4,"Pretty, Happy pictures of Pretty, Happy people","While this may not enhance your literacy, it is a beautifully put-together photo collection of a nostalgic period in our nation's history: the collective love-affair with the Kennedy family. Dress up that coffee table in Martha's Vineyard with this one."
1,Why Doesn't Lee Get Over It?,"The problem with this book and with most interviews of Lee Radziwill is her own overblown sense of importance. She imagines herself to be some type of royalty and labors to keep her privacy. What she fails to realize is that the only interest any reader would ever have in her is that she happens to be the sister of Jackie. So she can skip the plethora of pictures of herself, boring stories about ""One Special Summer"", etc. All that she has ever undertaken is founded upon her presumption that with minimal effort she should ""start at the top."" This book is a perfect reflection of her attempts to give nearly nothing and achieve great results. If she ever decides to get real and talk some substance and truth, I will gladly purchase her book....this, however, is simply an effort to ride on her sister's coattails."
1,Worthless,"This cd is simply terrible. It sounds like any generic American rock band on the scene at the moment. It bears NO resemblance to either death or doom metal, so I don't know what bands the previous review was using as comparison. This is just simply terrible."
3,A Limited Interest Story,"Although highly recommended by another reader, I didn't find this book particularly compelling. An Austrialian officer works on oceanliners in WWII crossing the Atlantic carrying soldiers. Yes, it is dangerous work as some ships were sunk. Fortunately, none of his crosses involved direct action other than high alerts and brief sightings. Unfortunately, that severely limits the action in the book. Other than these crossings, the book substantially covers the shore leave in New York City and England. This was a great time to be in these exciting locations but reads more like a travelogue than an interesting nonfiction war book.In summary, this author has good intention and describes his history in WWII. It just isn't the most exciting book unless you have interest in that period of history."
3,Julio's Dream ~Blue Sky Roadster,"This was an OK Cd. It isn't as good as their second one but the lyrics are good. The songs are greate too. As a rock CD, it's great."
2,"The Basics, but not much more","This guide book included interesting walking tours and descriptions of historic buildings and monuments of Quebec. However, it was not good at giving directions to locate restaurants. Although it did have a mini glossary of French terms, this did not include regional dishes found in restaurants, which was a problem for me in the few restaurants where no English menu was available. Also, the introductory text about the history and society of Quebec was not well-written. Too bad Let's Go! doesn't make a Quebec City guide!"
5,AMAZING KICKERS!!! Great support but NOT a walking shoe,"Ever since I got a pair of Nike Shox, I was VERY interested in seeing how Adidas would compare.The Hexagonal shock dampners on the A3 series are firmer than I expected: Translation less initial shock absorption. I do believe that they will soften with time. For now, the shoe feels great to jogg in. But don't expect DMX/ PUMP comfort when you walk.Oh, did I mention they're a steal at $45."
3,Cool looks but didn't last as long,"I ran with these 4 times a week. They are good shoes, however, some of the drawbacks are that you may get stones stuck on the bottom of the tread due to it's design. Also, the treads at the bottom didn't last as long compared to my other running shoes, like ASIC, etc. If these are on sale for a low price. I would get them."
4,very comfy,these are really comfortable running shoes with great support for daily throughout the city.
4,Great Shoe,"This is a great pair of shoes. I've owned several adidas shoes now with the A3 cushioning. All of them are great, and this is no exception. My only complaint is the color. I wished the yellow was not so bright, although I did expect that when I made the purchase. However, I intend on using these for night time running only. The only reason I give this a 4 out of 5 star is due ot the fact that I think the shoe is too bright to wear everywhere (without getting odd stares)."
5,Miley Cyrus Rocks! and so does her music as Hannah Montana,I love all of the songs that she sings and the concert DVD is awesome. the only thing that would make it better would be if it didn't have all those other artists on the CD.
1,Unique ripoff,"The two DVDs by Lloyd Brown appear to present one of the more brazen ripoffsat Amazon. 32 minutes for beginners at $26.99 and 37 minutes for Advanced at $30 totalling69 minutes at $56.99 are one of the most expensive dvds around at about 83 cents per minuteof material that could have all been presented in 15 minutes for about $15.You can get all of the symphonies of the greatest composers for less than the costof these two DVDs.For about twice the cost of these things you can buy a good recurve bow, a few arrows, a targetand learn to shoot with a few hours practice and some basic instruction from the store whereyou got the equipment.Good material from a fine instructor on a great sport at an absurdly high price.The USAA should scold him for discouraging potential members with suchprofiteering."
4,This Player works Awesome!!,"Great Volume, FM is average but I've droped it many times and never had a problem. Very Great purchase!!"
5,Accessory Kit is Great!!!,The accessory kit is awesome!! I have the dock set up by my home stereo with a cord running to my computer. It is nice becasue you can send songs directly to it from your computer and then play them through your stereo. The only minor complaint is the rechargable batteries do not last as long as real batteries but I was able to go over six hours on a plane with them. I only wish it had a remote.
1,Well written work of fiction.,"No doubt, Nick Pileggi is a great writer. However, Henry Hill was nothing but a slug who ratted out his best friends, destroying his family in the process. His life is as interesting as a runny nose.If you want to real more a accurate tome on Henry Hill and his misguided life, read ""On the Run"" written by his son and daughter; two people Hill really tortured, not to mention his wife Karen.At least Hill had the good grace to die. The cause was listed as a heart attack, but it's doubtful Hill had a heart to begin with."
2,Looks nice - doesn't bake well.,"Looks nice, looks like a quality product, however it doesn't get hot enough to bake a pizza properly."
4,not so bad!,"Near commercial grade quality. Have cooked eight frozen pizzas and all but the first one turned out very well. The crust was a bit under-done on the first pie, so I lined the crumb tray with foil and the added reflection gets it done just right. Also, turning the pie half-way through the cooking cycle is a nuisance, but absolutely necessary. Clean-up is quick and easy."
3,"More than a biker flick - a ""rack-focus"" classic!","I have a soft sport for this film for several reasons. Richard Rush was working with famed cinematographer Laslo Kovaks at this time and developed a technique called ""rack-focus"" - instead of cutting between two characters, the focus would be shifted within the shot. Working in the confines of American International Pictures genre films, Rush managed to be an original stylist. The theme song is an obscure song by Cream, ""Anyone for Tennis?""."
5,great,"Today's comic book artists need to take heed of this man's line and style. A time when artists knew their anatomy, form and shape. I don't think anyone's taking those classes these days. This guy was drawing real life superheroes. What a great artist and great book."
4,Movie was well done but couldn't hold a candle to the book,"I watched this movie immediately after reading the book. I enjoyed seeing the characters come to life on screen, and the scenery was wonderful, but the characters were not fleshed out as completely as I would have liked. I know that it is next to impossible to make a book into a movie and include all the details, but I also would have liked to have seen the part where Ishmael found the records in the lighthouse explained a bit better. If I hadn't read the book, there were some things in the movie that might not have been as easy to understand. But I thought Ethan Hawke was wonderful in the part of Ishmael."
2,Recording quality poor - half the advertised running time,"Silicone sisters with radically customized front ends and make-up applied with a cement gun move like lethargic zombies through a series of superficial exercises. The picture quality is no better than a copy-of-a-copy, and almost half the running time is used to advertise other videotapes, or on previews of the exercises that follow. Not exactly a total swindle at this price, but way below expectation."
1,Not worth it for the stretching or the women,"I bought this video because I wanted to learn how to stretch...and bought this video instead of others because well, I'm a guy and ""Hey! Nude women!"" Even if the stretching instruction wasn't great, it could be considered soft-core porn.Unfortunately, not only wasn't the stetching good... the women didn't really make up for it. It would be better to buy a *real* stretching video and ""Debbie Does Dallas"" instead"
5,Elegantly Erotic,"Three gorgeous women with enhanced breasts perform stretching routines for your viewing pleasure. Mostly, all three perform together on a simple, tasteful set. They move slowly and gracefully, so don't expect any jiggling. Also, only one exercise showing them completely from behind. The cameras pan back and forth over their entire bodies, including their private areas.Like the other videos in the Nude series, this video is about 35 minutes long, with 5-minute previews of Nude Tai Chi and Nude Yoga preceding, for a total length of 45 minutes.My wife and I like to watch this video to enjoy the ladies' beautiful bodies. I also recommend Nude Tai Chi, Nude Personal Training, Totally Nude Yoga and Tai Chi, and Totally Nude Aerobics."
2,Nude ladies,"Nude Stretching is a half hour long and you have three nude ladies that have a blank stare throughout video. The serious one seems to be the leader of the bunch. Each of the three ladies leads in at least two routines. You have a blonde instructor who is the poster girl for dumb blondes. Whether she is leading a stretch or just following along, she does not seem to know what she is doing. The music in the background has an oriental theme to it and the person in the background talking gives very, very poor instruction. At times I had a hard time following along. Only buy this video if you want to look at three nude ladies stretching in the nude because you will not get a good stretch from it. Nude Stretching gets a D-."
1,can't see the babes very well,"There are three totally naked woman, all long shot. Very few and quick close ups. The one babe on the far right in the first part is gorgeous. Of course the cameraman ignores her. In general, camera work and film quality are poor."
2,Over done,"~Ok, don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the book... just the way it was written. I loved the story behind it and it was moving and emotional, but the ""way"" the author wrote it annoyed me to the very end. The dialog between the characters and just the little things they said ~!~ Nobody really talks that way. I don't know, but just because of how they talked to eachother made it really apparent that an adult wrote the book and not the 17 yr old girl who lost her close friend. And the whole point of a book is to make the characters come to life, right? It would've worked for me if only the conversations had been more realistic."
5,"Touching, and absolutly beautiful","I picked this book up in fifth grade, just a quick pick in a bookstore, I wasn't really sure what it was about. But I got it, read it in about four hours (from ten pm till about 1 am) with out stopping. I couldn't...I absolutly could not put it down. I was so deeply touched by the delicacy the author portrays losing a loved one. I laughed and cried...it wasn't overally sentimental or sappy, and it didn't focus on the death so much it was edgy and harsh. It was a perfect mix between the two. I am in eighth grade now, and still read it about every month. It's an absolute must bye for anyone."
5,Amazing book,"I read this book over 6 years ago... I still pick it up every once in a while.It is so sad and sweet and touching, and I really good book."
5,Best Book I ever read,"this book.... this book is the best one ive ever read... for me, it was so life-like since Jimmy was a lot like me, and Gracie is a lot like my friends... this book brought me to tears... i had to stop reading or i would have starting sobbing, and sobbing during algebra isnt good... even when i let my friends borrow the book, they cried... and they also kept putting me in Jimmy's place...I recommend this book to anyone... it is a great book that brings reality to you..."
5,The tremendous story of two best friends,"Say Goodnight Gracie--Review... Say Goodnight Gracie is a tremendous story of two best friends. Two people who knew each other like the back of their own hand; one of which took the other for granted. Then had to deal with the biggest lose; she could ever imagine. Their relationship was so strong; nothing could ever come between them. One thing that really attracted me to this book, is how the main characters are so much like my best friend and I. This book really teaches valuable life lessons, and can relate to anyone who has friends."
5,A really good book!,"All I can say is that you have to read this book. You can readthe other reviews to find out what it's about, but it's a WONDERFULbook and i HIGHLY recommend it. END"
5,A Very Touching Book,"This book was very real and has all the difficulties of being a teenager and losing your best friend. It opened my eyes and made me not take my friends for granted. It told about Morgan, a 17 yr. old high school student that looses her best friend, Jimmy. He was in a car accident that involved a drunk driver. He was very outgoing, and a great dancer that would've been a star. She learns how to cope with the death without going crazy (even though she does go crazy a couple times!). She finds comfort within her family, and even makes a new friend. Over all it was a great book and I would recommend it to all ages."
5,"Say Goodnight , Gracie",I think that anyone who reads this book will fell as if they are realated to Morgan and Jimmy. When Jimmy died I had tears coming out of my eyes.When I read this book I felt like I was like Morgan apart of Jimmy.I think Aunt Lo was great to Morgan and without her Morgan wouldn't have made it without Jimmy. So far this book has been the best book iv'e read.If I had to rate this book on a scale from one to ten I would give it around about fifty.
1,A non-Partisan Review,"The author's review should not be published as a customer review. Include the video as asales pitch.The two DVDs by Lloyd Brown appear to present one of the more brazen ripoffsat Amazon. 32 minutes for beginners at $26.99 and 37 minutes for Advanced at $30 totalling69 minutes at $56.99 are one of the most expensive dvds around at about 83 cents per minuteof material that could have all been presented in 15 minutes for about $15.You can get all of the symphonies of the greatest composers for less than the costof these two DVDs.For about twice the cost of these things you can buy a good recurve bow, a few arrows, a targetand learn to shoot with a few hours practice and some basic instruction from the store whereyou got the equipment.Good material from a fine instructor on a great sport at an absurdly high price.The USAA should scold him for discouraging potential members with suchprofiteering."
2,Poor Value for Money,"Don't be deceived. This is not a full-fledged Magic School Bus CD, but is just an activity center. The Magic School Bus CDs fall into two categories: full-fledged exploration programs and activity centers. The full-fledged programs are excellent and represent good value for money. My oldest (age 6) spends hours exploring with MSB Oceans, Animals, Solar System, and Dinosaurs. They are great. On the other hand, he is quickly bored with the Activity Centers, such as Whales and Dolphins, Flight, and Mars. They simply present one screen with things to click on. Since a full-fledged MSB CD has half-a-dozen or more places to explore, the activity centers represent less than 1/6th the value of a full-fledged MSB CD. Don't buy them unless you get them for less than 1/6th the price of the full-fledged CDs, which means don't pay more than [price] for them. They are not worth more."
5,RuPaul is in her element...dead center in her element!!,"It was so nice to hear from this diva again - it's been far too long since had some quality camp-dance-disco-with-attitude! The intro skits are totally gut-busting! I laughed and laughed during these. She actually mocks and amplifies African American dilect, which is sure to please any listener. The album then kicks off with the movie hit ""Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous"". I didn't realize this was from a movie until I heard it. Wasn't it Connie & Carla? Then ""Coming Out of Hiding"", with it's attitude - what a great song. The rest of album pleases as well, with the exception of one song! What did Ru have to remake ""People are People""? I didn't like it, but wasn't awful enough to dock it a star.Bottom line: If you're a dance music fan, crazy about Ru, need a little fun in your life or want some quality drag queen tunes spinning on your CD player, this CD is for YOU!!"
2,"so, so......","As much as I love RuPaul, I have to say I was a little disapointed with the new album. I was a teenager when supermodel came out, and that was the best piece of insperation to a young gay kid ever made. Im not really diggin' the whole hip/hop feel, but hey, she's doing what she's gotta do and I can respect that. Miss Ru is probably one of the fiercest queen's on the scene, and she brings the runway where ever she goes, but this time around I feel that this album is more like redwarm then redhot. Miss Ru, I love you dearly and you have my support 100%, but what kind of fan would I be if I was not honest with my opinion?"
2,RUPAUL - An old dog with no new tricks - You're Not Cher Honey,"OK I bought this on a whim after stumbling across it in the USA. I remember buying Supermodel in the early 90's and completely loving it but this, this is nasty. It left a really awful after burn in my ears as I tried to remember the sample from the original artiste. I know the whole idea of Drag is to mime along to someone else's track but the durge that is considered, as original lyrics are truly painful. Only buy this if you are a true must have everything by him Fan.."
5,RUPAUL IS REDHOT!!!!!!,"this is by far ru paul's greatest work. after doing some commercial releases in the 90s, rupaul has released her own album -- of very personal, yet upbeat, songs. all of these songs could chart on the dance charts. the songs are political, emotional, comedic, and sassy. go, miss rupaul. you better work! by the way -- give it to rupaul for giving us the best phrase of the year: ""how do i look? look good, feel good...looking good and feeling gorgeous!"" i love it."
5,What a voice.,This is the second CD of Celinda Pink that we have purchased. What a joy to listen to her sing.
4,Really Liked It!,I really enjoyed it and only mark off a star because I can't stand one part of the plot line that I don't want to spoil for everyone else. Overall though I really liked it and love Molly! Worth the watch if you're a fan of British period dramas (like Pride & Prejudice or Downton Abbey).
5,Pleasant Surprise!,"I had never even heard of this film but, because of a suggestion by Amazon.com comparing it favorably to the A&E production of ""Pride & Prejudice"", I ordered it. What a pleasant surprise! A wonderful story, cast, music, everything! Very enjoyable. In fact, I have watched it 3 times since I received it & enjoyed it every bit as much as I did the first time!"
5,100 Star Movie!!,"This is one of my all time favorite movie!! In my opinion it could rival Pride and Prejudice. Justine Waddell and all of the actors bring this simple love story to life. We watched the last tape about 4 times because it is so good! You can't help but love all of the characters, even though you hate some of them. Watch it!!"
5,A study in the value of honesty,"A delightful, delicious, romantic period piece. Perhaps the most beautifully couched and photoghraphed love story I've ever watched. The value of virtue rises to a new level in cinema.Persistance and watchful waiting transcend immediate gratification and bring peace and joy to all...including the viewer.(A perfect boxed gift for my daughters birthday!)"
5,Beautiful,"This is a wonderful period piece, beautifully done and spoken. Molly is simply perfect. Sometimes I wonder if we all haven't been dumbed down from a time where language was spoken as an art form, and manners and duty mattered."
3,outstanding production but a bit slow,"Production values in this version of ""Wives & Daughters"" were amazing. The costumes and hairdos were so accurate for the 1830 period - well done. Story line was a bit slow, but I did not find Molly to be dull or priggish - I tend to NOT like the Cynthia character who is SO charming that every idiot falls for her no matter how shallow. I liked Molly and enjoyed her relationship with her father. The stepmother done by Francesca Annis, was very good. And Gambon's multi-faceted work as the squire was also excellent. Glad that Roger and Molly finally find each other at the end, although I doubt she would have worn pants in Africa, perhaps a divided riding skirt or bloomers? Not as good as ""North & South"" - (John Thornton character hard to beat) but entertaining."
5,LOVED IT!!!!!!,I am a huge fan of the BBC shows and I knew this one wouldn't let me down. =] I can watch it over and over again. It is so sweet and innocent that you can't help but fall for the characters. This one goes right to the top of my list along with the Jane Austin movies I so dearly love.
4,Very enjoyable,"I would not say that this is a classic production but nonetheless it is very enjoyable. A distracting feature of the production was that the actress playing the heroine appeared to be painfully thin - one longed to make her sit down for several bowls of stew. Leaving that aside, there is plenty of drama in this story and it was lovely to see the love interest between the heroine and the young biologist unfold - the dawning realisation on his part that he loved her. And, of course, the sad story of the brother critically ill and leaving a wife and family. A small criticism is that I thought the production ended on a twee note (the panoramic vision of the couple on the desert heights walking together seemed a little silly) but maybe that is also in the book (which I have not read)."
5,British Drama,This is yet another BBC classic. Very well acted and directed and beautifully costumed. Script is superb. Many hours of total enjoyment.
5,A Period Classic,"This movie follows the life of a 17 year old ""motherless"" country girl who struggles with love and loss. She challenges the gossipers and noble standards and exemplifies a young woman of integrity and loyalty. If you like ""Pride & Prejudice"" then this is a movie for you. A MASTERPIECE WORTH SEEING!!"
5,It is worth it!!!,"I bought Wives and Daughters without ever having seen it or knowing more than what other people said about it, and I don't regret the purchase at all. I am a huge fan of BBC films and period films alike, and this is a great addition to my collection. This story seems more like real life than the wishful thinking (which I love) in Pride and Prejudice, and in that respect I like it more, but in all I love the two equally. If you like Pride and Prejudice, you must see this!!!"
5,Excellent production,"I give this a 4 1/2 stars. It is up there with the best of them, including North and South, Pride and Prejudice, Bleak House, etc. Superbly done by all, actors and producers. Note that the third DVD is all special features. I thought there might be more story on that one and was a bit disappointed that there wasn't, but the special features were good, too. Definitely recommend adding to your collection."
5,"domestic scenes, historic trends","This is an especially fine piece of television drama. The screenplay is intelligent and witty, and inspires a real interest in the material and the characters. Gambon and Waddell are outstanding among an almost faultless cast. The characters of Molly and Cynthia are endearing at a human level, but also fascinating as emblems of the cultural and social changes - both limitations and possibilities - affecting women in the 19th century. Neither is a spokeswoman for any '-ism', but each provides a moving and articulate response to the greater issues of power and responsibility. The emerging scientific challenges to religious and social (and familial) orthodoxies, also explored, are dramatised neither self-consciousnessly nor by imposing a false note upon the narrative of several ordinary lives. I found this story worth savouring and re-viewing."
5,I absolutely adore Wives and Daughters the movie!,"I decided to read the book before purchasing the DVD. I am very pleased to say that this movie is rather true to the book. One can feel that the actors took time to develop their characters. I would give this a 5 star plus if there were such a rating. Also, a side note, Elizabeth Gaskell died suddenly before completing the book, but, one can assume the ending from all that is implied in the previous pages in the book. The movie does end the story and in the way that was implied in the book. It is very nice to have the actual closure. I cannot say enough about how wonderful I found this movie. It is definitely worth it to buy. I have already watched this 300 minute movie twice since Christmas, and I am one who usually waits six months between rewatching any movie."
2,Wives and Daughters,"Read the customer reviews and bought the DVD. Very disappointed. I love just about anything with Francesca Annis in it but this was just boring. Want something great with Ms. Annis buy the BBC production ""Lillie"" based on the life of Lillie Langtry. That's worth your time and money."
5,A movie you can sip your tea with,"If you like Pride & Prejudice then you will love this movie. Elegant movie, you will go from being sad, mad to happy. A movie you can watch over & over again. You will not be disappointed."
4,Good stuff.,"I fell in love with Elizabeth Gaskell's other book that was made into a movie, North and South, so when Amazon recommended Wives and Daughters, I was very happy to see something else by her.To be honest I was not instantly in love with the material as it is sometimes slow and I kept waiting for it to pick up. It eventually does and I believe that the viewer's patience is rewarded. The romance was nowhere on the realm of North and South or Pride and Prejudice but like everything else in this miniseries, it grows on you. Overall, I liked it."
5,My all time Favorite,I absolutely LOVE this movie. The first time I saw it I couldn't stop watching it and everyone else says the same thing about it. Just last week I watched the whole thing again for the 4th time with some friends and still enjoyed it!
5,I adore it,"I adore Molly, and Roger. This is a wonderful little series and I was totally captivated by it. Wonderful story with so many kind and loving people. I love Molly's father as well, he's so steadfast and true."
3,"VCR Movie Review, Wives and Daughters","Such a lovely story and well preformed by my favorite actors.. But I'm shocked by the horrible editing, video adaptation apparently from widescreen to TV screen... This should have never been put on the market like this. I have to wonder the experience and mental,physical condition of the person editing. Were they highly medicated? It is terrible, a bad reflection on BBC and sorry excuse for what should have been a joy to view... cut off faces, people talking and noone else in the frame.. Tape 2&3 had obvious static, crunchy sounds of VCR tracking, overpowering the audio. . So Disappointed... I will be more careful ordering BBC movies in the future and scour reviews for more problems like this..."
5,Jane Austen Fan Converted to Elizabeth Gaskell Also,"This is a wonderful 300 minute movie! It is very clean and tasteful! If you enjoy Jane Austen books/movies I'm sure you will enjoy Elizabeth Glaskell ones too. I highly recommend BBC's ""North and South"" by Gaskell also. These two movies like the A&E production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" are romances with plots. The emotions, situations and personalities of the characters are true to life and we can still relate to them in this century. Though they might be thought of as ""Chick Flicks"", the story lines have enough depth to them to hold the attention of my ""macho"" husband!"
4,A Sweet Slice of Victorian Life,"Glossy and grand coming-of-age story following the only daughter of a widower and her relationships with those who shape her life. She has to put up with a new stepmother and wayward step-sister, a handful of guys and a town full of gossips. It's sweet slice of Victorian life in northern England. Although its gentle pace can feel a little slow at times, we feel immersed in the past. The setting is sumptuous and the costumes are superb. Lady Harriet is fabulous and Michael Gambon as Squire Hamley is a treasure."
1,Loved it but will NOT purchase the DVD,"getting tired of BBC Video and their american distributors producing dvds with the wrong screen ratios. i've decided i will not purchase another bbc video with a 4:3 (1:33:1) screen ratio where a third of what i see on the televised program is cut off on the dvd. it's infuriating, especially in historical dramas. who makes these decisions???? i've had it. i'm done. and by the way, i was reasearching to buy a whole collection of the jane austin videos shown on masterpeice but having reviewed this issue i'm now not going to do (and that includes all the prime suspect series volumes, too, which i was going to buy all of them until i found out they are cut up as well in the american dvds). it's either 16:9 (1.78.1) or no buyer here."
2,Mislabeled and No Moving Information in box,"Just opened Wives and Daughters to watch after recieving. The disk seem to be mislabeled because they say it is disk 5,6 and 7, not 1, 2 and 3, which is what it should be. Also there is no information in the box or on disk that give information about the show, like other movie disk that I have purchased."
2,Rent or watch on Netflix...,"I had this on my Netflix queue for some time, and it took more than one sitting to get into the first episode. I never liked Molly, which I think is a major factor. If I cannot like the heroine, I might as well turn it off. I made it through the entire 4 episodes though, and just never really liked anyone. Michael Gambon was a great actor, of course, but his performance was levels above anyone else so that he seemed out of place! **SPOILER** And where the heck was the kiss/romantic embrace at the end? I know the novel was unfinished and the writers had to make up an ending, but please. If this is supposed to be a romantic novel, there should be a more romantic resolution than what was given. I was really let down and immediately said aloud, ""Well, that sucked."" Glad I didn't buy it."
2,Watch BEFORE You Buy!,"I agree completely with the review posted by A. Adams. My expectations for this BBC period piece were extremely high given the raving reviews it received on Amazon. The first half of the series bored me to tears. I do admit the characters were less static during the last two episodes. Still, I can't imagine watching this series again. I would strongly encourage anyone interested in BBC drama to rent W&D before making a purchase! The BBC period pieces, North & South (also based on Gaskill) and Pride and Predjudice are VERY good, however, and are worth every penny."
4,A.A.H.,"Delightful, Interesting, just plain Amusing. What characters! Very well acted. Very convincing. It keeps you guessing. Very well done all around."
5,"Beware of ""Box Set"" claim!","While I just love this movie, I was really disappointed in the case it came in. Amazon advertises it as a ""Box Set,"" but it's not like any box set I've ever seen or owned! It's more like what I'd call a foldout case. There is no ""box"" around it to hold the flaps of the folder together. The three DVDs are really hard to remove from the clear hard plastic that holds them into the inner side of each of the three panels of the foldout holder. The discs are not in the nice keep cases that I thought they would be in. I imagined the box set would be like my ""Pride and Prejudice"" special edition box set, but it is definitely sub par. Aside from this physical problem, I absolutely love my ""Wives and Daughters"" DVD. The dialouge is not a witty as what Jane Austen wrote, but it has it's own charm and is a wonderful story with superb acting. The character of Squier Hamley is especially well developed, and Molly is adorable!"
3,Acer Aspire 5672,"I ordered this laptop on Amazon, but the actual vendor was J&R.; Amazon is very good in delivering package on time. When I opened the package I felt very happy to see the shining Acer Aspire notebook.Installed everything, and started to use it normally, then I found that the volume is very bad. Its very low compared to HP. But the screen and the colours are very good.Also the base gets heated up very fast. After using for some 45 min, the base of the laptop is like a burner.I dont know, I didnt like the laptop for this volume & Heat and thought of returning back. I called up J&R; and they gave me a RA number, I sent my laptop to them and after 1 week I got my money back.Both Amazon and J&R; are excellent."
1,cheap,"So I saw this on Amazon a little while ago, but instead of ordering it, I saw it at a local costume shop. It looks cute and that's what I liked about it. Anyhow, I tried it on, shirt and skirt were okay.... shirt a little see through though. I start a load of wash and washed it correctly. Though when I took it out, the ""corset"" fell apart. I found pieces of ""stuffing"" in the form of foam. Irritated! Sadly, there is a no returns in this store that I bought it in, so there goes my money! I would defiantly NOT buy it."
2,shirt was aweful,"This costume was a good price; however, the ""gauze"" style shirt was aweful. I ended up buying something else last minute. So much for the general sizing. I am 5'9"" and 135 lbs. I generally wear a small to medium. This shirt was so small it would fit a child. The elastic was super tight. In addition, the vest was so cheaply made I threw it away after one wearing. It barely held up for the occassion. The skirt, however, was comfortable and fit well. I realize it is just a costume, but nothing like being uncomfortable all night at a fun party. I would not recommend this costume."
1,Eww!,"This costume looks very frumpy. Also, the top part is very short, so unless you have a mini sized torso it will probably not fit right."
5,True to the MOVIE... perfect for your Oz fan.,"If you can get a hold of a nice used copy of this book, it is such a great find. True to the movie with beautiful photographs. My daughter is such a huge Oz fan, she really enjoyed having this book added to her collection."
3,Decent little lantern,"I picked up one of these specifically to convert it to LED. Construction is light weight, but they hold up fine if you don't abuse them. Out of the box it works ok, puts out a decent amount of light although it drains the batteries fairly quickly. I found it to be a great platform in which to install a Cree LED pumping a Chromalit remote phosphor. Nice light, 10+ hour battery life and it's a compact, light weight lantern. As a platform for a fun DIY conversion, it was a cheap starting point with a nice end result."
2,You Get What You Pay For!,These were a great price- but honestly they are crap. 2 were broken in the box (the nob fell off of the first and the other just wouldn't turn on) If you are going to use these for anything worthwhile pay the extra money and get a better product! They don't give off that much light either.
2,Emergency lights,Accidentally bought these but I kept them for my emergency supplies. Very cheaply made and probably will never use them but I have them. Would not recommend.
1,cheapo...design,These are nothing more than a set of cheap-o flashlights. The little incandescent bulb that burns thru the batteries too quickly. Save your money and buy a nice LED model from a brand name maker. I should've known better..
1,One out of three work!,"Bought these emergency lanterns for just that - first time I tried to use them, only one would work. After tinkering with them, discovered that 2 had bad bulbs. One had bad bulb as well as being defective. Disappointing as they are small and cute."
2,They died,I was in a rural community with these lanterns at night. They worked for one week then promptly burned out
1,Do not buy,The product is not worth wasting your time with. Poorly made and likely will not even work upon first use. Of the three only one of mine worked briefly under very normal use. Get something else.
1,JUNK!,"Took these are a camping trip - straight out of the box. Not ONE worked. NONE.Poor quality, could not even close battery comparment on one, so poorly constructed."
1,latern,"Low qualty carbage from China. Low grade plastic,falls apart easily. Non operational switch. Yuuck. Yuuck and More Yuuck. I hate it."
3,You get what you pay for,"I knew what I was getting with these, so I'm not entirely disappointed, but it was a bit frustrating that I actually had to take apart 2 of the 3 lanterns to fix them (some of the connecting wires were loose in the inside).If you don't any ""tinkering"" ability I'd avoid these. Otherwise, they're definitely the cheapest lanterns you can get!"
1,These do not work,Batteries do not fit in the compartment and as a result don't work. They are Useless as an emergency lamp
1,"Dont waste your money, buy something else.","I experienced a power outage last night. 2 of the 3 lanterns stopped working. 1 lantern just turned off on its own, wont power back on. The other lantern was turned off by my wife and will not turn back on. These lanterns are cheaply made in China, look for something else."
3,Ok for small lights.,"Nota lantern to be used in the event of a power outage, as it does not give off much light. But i will work if you just need to go outdoors or into dark room for a brief moment."
1,Get what you pay for,"I used one of the lanterns, and the bulb died within about 2 hours. I'm now having a heck of a time finding a replacement bulb, which I now fear is deliberate: force the customer to buy a new lantern."
2,2 lanterns not working,"I bought two boxes of whetstone set of 3 lanterns for my grandchildren for Christmas. I went to wrap them December 18. I put brand new batteries in them, 4 of them work and two do not. I put several different batteries in. Now I don't have enought for my grandchildren. I have 6 grandkids and only 4 work. I am not a happy camper."
1,Disappointed,When I opened the box and one of the handles on the lantern was broken!!! The lanterns are made out of cheap materials and I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item to anyone!!! Save your money!!!
1,Terrible!,"I bought these for camping but got to use them for a power outage first. After less than one hour ALL (6 of them, we bought 2 packs) of the lights were not working! Its like they are shorting out. They were not misused or treated rough. Save your money! Find something else."
1,A waste of money!,"I really could have used these if they worked! With the batteries in place, they worked the first time I used them, but I could never get them to work again! I was using brand new batteries, and I even tried different ones. They just would never work for me again. I should have returned them, but never got around to it. My mistake!"
3,Emergency Lanterns,The on/off switch on one of the three worked the way it was suppose to. The other two turn off/on only one way not both ways as stated. All three worked but not the way as stated in ad.
1,Received Defective Lanterns,"Ordered these lanterns to keep on hand for emergencies. Recently lost power for 7 days and thought that these would have come in handy. When I received the order, I immediately put batteries into the lanterns for storage and found that one of them did not work at all. Tried everything to see if I could get it to work, but apparantly it was defective. The return to amazon was simple, but now I'm back to square one trying to find a reliable and inexpensive emergency lantern. What a waste of my time."
1,Knobs break easily,Before we took them out of the box two of the threee knobs had broken off. We used the other one for a weekend when the power was out for 36 hours and then the next time we were going to use it when the power was out. The other knob broke off. Really not a good product at all.
3,Get what you pay for,"The lanterns were handy and provided good light. I bought these for my two children--4 and 7--the plastic is pretty cheap and they are all cracked now. Also, the handles on two of the 3 lanterns were broken off by someone pulling too hard on them. I suppose you get what you pay for; but treat these gently because they will crack or break."
1,Good price for useless junk,I bought these lanterns for my Girl Scouts to use on a camping trip. We used them last weekend none of the lanterns lasted more then an hour. I used high quality batteries. I am not sure what is wrong with these lanterns but none work now. I am so glad I brought along extra lanterns. I cannot return my worthless lanterns because I threw away the packaging.
1,The bulbs don't last and can't be replaced,"I bought three of these a few months ago. Only one is still working. The bulbs on the other two burned out after very few hours of use, and I CAN'T FIND ANY NEW ONES. I tried contacting the seller and Amazon and received no answer.I agree these are very low-priced. I now realize that means they're considered to be disposable."
1,worthless,"The product was wothless. When I received the product I didn't expect much because of the price. But, what I received was basically a useless product that you would find being sold at some street in a third world country. Only reason I gave it a rating of one star was because I was not allowed to give it no stars."
2,not a happy camper!,I purchased these for a camping trip and within the first hour of nightfall 2 of the 3 had already gone out.
2,Soooo not worth it!,I got these lanterns just before the bad storms hit VA. I was thankful to have them for all of the day (1 day that is) that they worked. I put in new batteries so I shouldnt have had any problems with them but my second night was spent in darkness (sadly)...Oh and did I mention that I have a 6 month old baby at the time? This item and the seller really let me down and I DONT recommend either of them.
1,"Junk , Trash ,ect","If there were free , maybe better review , but not !!!! I bought 3 and 1 works and the one that works has a broken nob ! Cheap cheap!!! Don't buy this it not worth it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,DARKSTAR,"During the storm power outage on 06/29/12,two of the emergency lanterns worked for 15 min.'s,the other didn't work at all.All three had new batteries."
4,Emergency lights for power failures,"Yes, I am quite happy with this product and will use it everytime there is a power failure or hurricane."
2,Very unsatisfied,I have taken this item to use in India where you know there are lots of power cut and I don't want to be in the dark. Only one was working out of the box and that one also gone out of order after 5 days of use. I did produce a return shipping receipt for a refund but I run out of space in my check in baggage and had to left it. I will recommend to test it before taking it to a trip otherwise you might be a bad situation like me.
2,handle broke first night,the handle broke the first time my daughter tried to carry it - so not well made but is bright. wouldn't buy again
1,Emergency Lanterns,I've returned these lanterns because they 2 of the 3 in the box were received broken. They are to small and fragile. Not what I was expecting!
1,Utterly Worthless,"I purchased six of these in anticipation of Superstorm Sandy. They were a handy, portable size, and threw off quite a bit of light. All six worked perfectly on the night of the storm, and when we went to bed, we turned them off.Not any of the six ever worked again, which was not at all helpful given that we were without power for five days. We threw them out."
2,I don't like it,It came with one of the lamps broken. I was unable to get in touch with anyone to speak about it.
1,Pure Junk,"First, they are MINI lanterns. They are VERY small. They also don't work well. 2 of the 6 I got stopped working inside of 24 hours."
1,cheap piece of crap,lantern burned out on after about 2 hours without straight use.don't waste your money unless you need it for 5 minutes worth of use.
1,Junk,This product is not worth the money. I received 2 broken lanterns and one did not work. They would not let me return them. In my opinion they are garbage.Don't waste you money. I am very sorry I did not read other reviews.Trademark Emergency Lanterns (Set of 3)
1,Don't waste your money,I bought these lights for blackouts and they only lasted for about five minutes until the bulbs blew out. It would be more expensive to replace the bulbs than it cost to buy the lights and thought there must be a defect in design so I threw them in the trash.
2,You get what you pay for...,Two of the lantern handles were broken before they were even used. I have had them for about one week and only one is still working. The springs that hold the batteries have broken on two of them. The one that is still in service is working well....for now. I don't expect it to last long if the other two lanterns are any indication of the quality. Cheap. Would not reccomend. My suggestion..Spend more money and get a quality lantern.
1,Would not buy them again.,Could have been just the ones I ordered but they didn't work well. They are cheap looking and take a lot of batteries. Would not buy again.
3,ok,these would be ok little lights but they are constructed kind of cheap they can break easy but theyre ok
2,Too small,These items are much smaller then they appear in ad and one has already broken--don't recommend this at all.
1,not that grat,"Had Santa bring these for Christmas this year. One didn't work from the get-go and we buried the second one the next week~after turning it on 3 times. The third one works if you shake it just right and hold it there. Wouldn't recommend them and certainly won't buy them again. Oh and it's not like we were dropping them off the roof or anything, we just were turning them on and off"
2,"Careful what batteries you use,it could make a difference","I was really disappointed! We used these on our patio at night, the second time we changed the batteries the bulbs went bad ( turned black)We used duracell coppertop batteries so maybe that had something to do with it but it happened to two of the lanterns and we didn't bother with the third one.They are cute enough but not very well made."
2,The lights don't shine,Only one of the lamps actually works now having only used them once. The bulbs don't seem to be securely attached.
2,"Nice, but only if they work","Ordered a box of 3...1 worked fine, 1 had to be man-handled to get it to work, and the last one wouldn't work at all. The ones that work really do put out some nice light and they are easy to carry with the handle. They're kind of cheaply made and definitely can't be dropped, but they aren't very expensive either, so I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Lamp Review,It arrived in the time specified. Two of the lanterns worked great but the third does not work at all. Something seems to be wrong with the switch and will not turn on when switched to the on position.
3,Emergency lantern,"They were okay but didn't throw as much light as I thought, expected them to be a little better, nice but not as good for purpose."
3,Only OK,"We have used these in the past and took them out with the recent power outage. After some time, they dimmed so I changed the battery. When I changed the batteries, they stopped working. Very disappointing."
3,Bulbs went out quickly,"We ordered these for hurricane season. They are lightweight and easy to carry around. They give off a ton of light. However the first night we used them 7 of 9 of the lanterns I bought went out. The next day we figured out it was just a lightbulb issue, which was easy enough to fix, but was not cool in the middle of the night when our power was out. we had only used the lanterns for about 10 minutes when they went out and the batteries were brand new."
3,Let's you see things before you trip on them,"I love this item for what it does. It lights up the tent pretty well, for such a dinky thing. If you need to get up in the middle of the night to use the toilet while you are camping, this is a really handy thing to have.I don't know why I thought that something bought new in this day-in-age would utilize LED technology. Unfortunately, these do not, which means that if you blow out the lamp it will be difficult to buy a replacement. Unfortunately, it also means that the 4 AA batteries required to operate these units will not last a very long time.Other than that, we are happy with them but wonder why they didn't used LED technology which last much longer and requires much less power."
2,Possibly the worst-made lamps I've ever seen...,"Pros:- cheap- functional- disposableCons:- incandescent bulb- relatively short run-time- incredibly bad build quality- falls apart; not good for kidsThese are possibly the worst-made lamps I've ever seen -- you probably couldn't even find these at the street market in Hong Kong. The biggest flaw is that the lamp's lid and handle attach to the base via compression only. If this had a simple twist-lock mechanism, it would have held up reasonably well.All that being said, you get 3 functional lamps for a Hamilton, so you can't complain too much."
3,cute,"my grandson loves flashlights and lanterns, these are a made a little cheap, battery connections are a little loose, but the price was right for a toddler toy.."
3,"You Get What You Pay For, hopefully","These inexpensive lanterns would be a very good deal if the manufacturer would have spent a little money on a decent switch. The switch is no more than one little piece of metal pressing down on another little piece of metal. In no time, the metal pieces lose contact. I had to take each lantern apart and bend one piece of metal so that it would contact the other piece of metal when you turned the knob on the switch. Yes, you can take them apart. It just takes a few minutes to figure out how."
3,Colorful and fun,Colorful plastic and they work. Kids will love them for camping in the backyard but I wouldn't buy them for emergency purposes. You DO get what you pay for so don't expect a lot and you will be pleased with your purchase.
1,lanterns,"Big waste of money, do not last, would dscourage anyone from buying for power outages, will not last one night."
3,Sort of okay,"Of the three lamps, one's nob broke off while I was taking it out of the box. The other two work fine as emergency lamps, which is why I bought them. Some super glue might save the third lamp - If not it's going to be spar parts..."
2,Emergency Lanters,I got these emergency lanters for myself for when the area has power outages. They have come in very handy and are cute enough to display with any theme. I like them so much I'm thinking of giving a set to friends and family as extra little Holiday presents. The batteries for the lanters are very affordable and easy to install.March 2012...One of the light bulbs has blown out and I can't find how to remove this old bulb and insert a new one.
1,Trash,"I ordered two sets of these to use at a small yard party. Three out of the six arrived non-functional. One was missing the entire light socket, although it rattled pretty good. The other two just didn't turn on at all. Of the remaining three, two would only turn on with the switch 'just so', and would flicker off when moved. Literally. One worked fine...for the length of the party...then it died. No, it wasn't the batteries; they all three got fresh batteries and not one of them worked the next day. The amount of light they put out was similar to a fading solar path light, hardly enough to illuminate the table where they sat. This was a colosal waste of money, time and energy. Think: cheap, thin-plastic gumball toys."
