4,Predictable and quite entertaining.,"A Savannah lawyer is defending a beautiful client from her father. He got involved with the client. The plot twist is quite predictable but nevertheless this is quite entertaining film based on John Grisham story. Another high point of the DVD is the exceptional sound quality in 5.1. Even though this movie doesn't have many action scenes, but the sound of passing trucks, rains and so on are very realistic."
2,Disappointing and predictable,"This is not a good film. And I'm surprised by the relatively positive responses here and on critics' websites. I found the story flimsy and obvious, the acting over done or boring, the characters uninteresting, the lighting frequently too dark and overall aggrivating.I do love Altman, and appreciate his stamp here. The intensity of activity and conversation is here, but limited by glaring accents and dialogue. As great as some of his films are, he has equal the number of films that don't work, and loyal I remain, but this is one of the latter."
4,Dark atmosphere and gripping storyline.,"A rainy, dark Savannah, Georgia during a hurricane provide a backdrop for this film. Parts of the story are weak, but the acting takes you through them all to a final scene that is exciting and satisfying."
2,I didn't like this one,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. My opinion about this movie is not a good one. I watched it with a group of friends and none of us particulary cared for it. It was very slow, predictable. The scenes were dark and there was alot of mumbling among characters. Being from the south, I have to disagree with another reviewer here, I don't think the lead character did a very good southern accent. Robert Downey Jr. actually had it pegged a bit better, in my opinion. I can see how some would like this movie, I generally like movies of this type, which of course is why I rented it. It just didn't interest me at all."
1,"""Cromulent""","was the word used to describe this film to me when a friend suggested I watch it. I had a craving for a Grisham film, and hadn't seen this one. Now, ""cromulent,"" of course, means that it's awful but pretends to be brilliant. Frankly, I think that's too kind. The music alone is so melodramatic the film can't keep up. The story wanders until the last half hour or so, when everything, including a metaphorical storm that's been building since the beginning breaks in a beautful mess. This might be the worst film I've seen in ages."
4,That's How The Cookie Crumbles...,"THE GINGERBREAD MAN has a lot going for it. First, it's directed by genius, Robert Altman. Second, it has an unbelievably stellar cast- Kenneth Branagh (HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS), Embeth Davitz (SCHINDLER'S LIST, THE HOLE), Robert Downey jr. (IN DREAMS, ZODIAC), Daryl Hannah (BLADERUNNER, FINAL TERROR), Tom Berenger (THE SUBSTITUTE, SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME), and Robert Duvall (THE GODFATHER 1 and 2, APOCALYPSE NOW)! Now, I'm not a huge John Grisham fan, so I didn't think I would like this film as much as I did. The story is suspenseful / mysterious, though the NY POST's declaration that TGM is ""A spellbinding thriller"" is a bit overwrought. Branagh is good as the Atlanta lawyer caught up in the bizarre world of Embeth Davitz and her crazy dad (Duvall). The rest of the cast are fine in their smaller roles, especially Robert downey jr. and Daryl Hannah, complete w/ southern accents! Well worth checking out..."
3,Complex drama,"Interesting drama some plot twists, not terribly exciting. I may watch it again to see if I missed something...purchased at Amazon at a great price so it's well worth it."
3,Only moderately thermal,"It doesn't keep coffee hot for as long as I was hoping it would. An hour or so seems to be its limit. Very attractive and solid item, though."
1,Don't Bother,"I have never spent this much for a carafe in my life!Thinking if it cost this much it must keep your drinkhot....NOT!Don't bother even wanting this for anything buta pretty conversation piece, because that's all it's goodfor...."
1,for chair bound,"This video is great ,,,if you are unable to move ...bound to a chair ...but if you are not ..do not wasteyour time with this video...In fact ,,there are much better chair yoga videos around ..."
4,Great Vocals,"I thought this album was pretty good. He does remakes of old songs but he does a very good job. This CD is definitely worth the money and his vocals are better than ever. He has a great voice and it shines throughout the CD. By the way, he also does some trance music with Milk Inc. and Marc Et Claude -- which are also really awesome tunes.Songs are well done and music are GREAT! For sure, Tony has the best male vocals to date. I hope his next CD will be all Vocal Trance, which he really shows his talents. No one has better vocals then Tony himself! I'm looking forward to his next debut and hoping he does more great music. In fact, he should do a remake of True--trance style--this would be a big hit!"
3,"Tony Hadley, what a voice. Too bad the CD is lacking.","Tony Hadley the singer from the 80s pop sensation Spandau Ballet shines on this solo effort with ""Save A Prayer"" a remake of the Duran Duran classic, which actually outshines the original. Tony Hadley co-wrote several songs on this CD, including ""She"" a lovely ballad about his daughter, and ""Wonderful Life"", and also a great remake of the Tears for Fears song ""Woman In Chains."", however the downside of this song is there are too many covers including ""Free Falling"" from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, ""Shes Gone"" a tired 70s tune from Hall and Oates, and ""Have You Seen Her"". Tony definitely has a talent in songwriting, he should just put that effort entirely on one CD, and forget the covers of rehashed songs past their prime."
1,"TONY YOUR LOST, FIND SPANDAU BALLET QUICK!","This CD has a couple of highlights of his own written songs, but too much of the CD is of old remakes like Hall & Oates ""Shes Gone"", Tears for Fears ""Woman In Chains"", Duran Durans ""Save A Prayer"" and Tom Pettys ""Free Fallin'"". If I wanted to listen to these songs I would of bought the originals. Tony has a wonderful voice and needs to showcase it, but here it is lost with a poorly produced, and structured album. This is a loser. Sorry, Tony."
2,"Hadley works better with Spandau Ballet, but voice is #1","Tony Hadley the lead singer for the 80s pop group Spandau Ballet, comes out with his 2nd solo effort.The fall down of this album is he does too many covers....Hall & Oates ""Shes Gone"", Duran Duran ""Save A Prayer"" (which is actually better than the original)....and the list goes on.However on Hadleys written efforts i.e. ""She"" shows that Hadley has writing talent and that he should continue with new material not somebody elses.But like I said earlier because of Hadley's beautiful vocals, he gives ""Save A Prayer"" a new life and really outshines the original.However the CD loses on too many covers, which are from the 70s and 80s, that are basically forgotten songs anyway.....so sorry Tony I have to give this a fair to midland rating.....please next time write all new material or work with previous Spandau Ballet songwriter Gary Kemp.Better luck next time."
1,DEAD ON DELIVERY. HADLEY LOSES ON SOLO CD.,"I love Hadleys voice and his previous endeavors with Spandau Ballet, but this CD sucks major. With rehasing old songs from old past that do not need to be remade...The only songs worth listening to are the ones he wrote ""She"", ""Wonderful Life"", and the Duran Duran's ""Save A Prayer"" is actually the only remake that beats the original, otherwise this CD fails miserably. Sorry Hadley but you need a better Promotions Director, Agent, and Producer to get you back on track."
1,HADLEY COVERS EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN AND FAILS.,"Tony Hadley lead singer for the 80s pop sensation Spandau Ballet has a wonderful voice, but this album is fair at best, for only a couple of songs. His cover of ""Save A Prayer"" from Duran Duran beats the original, but the album goes down hill with almost all covers of old tired songs like Hall & Oates ""Shes Gone"", Bryan Ferrys ""Slave to Love"" and Tom Pettys ""Free Fallin'"", where Hadley really falls. He wrote a couple of his own songs ""She"", and ""Wonderful Life"" which are the strong points. Hadley stick to song writing, and don't do old covers...especially Tears for Fears ""Woman In Chains"".......your voice fits your writing style not others."
1,HORRIBLE COVERS-HADLEY SINGS LIKE A CHANTEUSE IN A NIGHTCLUB,"Cover, after cover, after cover....Hadley sings boring songs that don't need to be done!...Free Fallin', Shes Gone, Save A Prayer...etc...The only standout is ""She"" which Hadley wrote.Boring, Boring, Boring...he belts out like he is singing in a night club....All you need Hadley is a smokey bar and a pink boa."
2,"A Bit of a Disappointment, Actually","This was definitely not a page-turner. I would recommend this book only if you are looking for some light reading to take on vacation as it would be very easy to pick up and put down at any point. Having read all but two of the Lively novels, my personal favorite is The Photograph, a poignant and memorable work."

4,Could stand improvement; still very helpful,"I have been using this dictionary in working with a local family-- newcomers to the U.S-- who speak Swahili and very little English. I am not trying to use the dictionary to learn Swahili . . . just to communicate very basic ideas, like why it's important for the refrigerator door to be able to close completely [""jijidudu,"" anyone?] For my purposes, this dictionary is superior to other ones that I have seen. As the title suggests, it is focused on practical words, not just on words specific to travel (such as ""Where is the baggage counter?"") However, this dictionary is indeed missing some common words, and includes some others that seem like strange choices. . . . do I really need a translation of ""Crikey!""?"
5,Excellent source and easy to use,"This up-to-date dictionary has helped me significantly for increasing my Swahili vocabulary very rapidly. It has many additions in the new version, and is applicable to modern usage in East African countries, as well as American and British English. The shipping was prompt and the item was received without damage."
3,needed book,I speak and write Kiswahili but sometimes I still need a dictionary to get the right word. This is a good one.
1,Blank pages,"There is not a lot of choice of dictionaries in this language at a low price. Also, I understand there are many dialects of this language. The dictionary that I bought had several blank pages, maybe that was the reason that it was less in price. But it was not mentioned in it's description. Overall, I don't think that I would spend the money for another one because of the dialect problem."
5,Classic Blues Sounds,This is a great slide. I have about 4 others that I use but the JP Boneyard is quickly becoming # 1. This slide comes in different sizes but I went with the large/long. At first it felt a bit too large but now that I'm used to it I don't know if I would want the smaller size.The boneyard is also nice looking so you feel like you're working with a high quality tool.
4,The Only Problem,"This phone is great, all except for one thing. when i purchased the phone i didn't see where it said you had to call your phone company and subscribe to get caller ID so you end up having to pay more money to actually use all the features on this phone. other than that it's great."
2,couldn't get to finish it,"I was able to get down to the last 10 minutes of the video and in went out on me, the class didn't get to see the end of the video. I have tried for 2 days to get it going anain and it won't work."
2,I have to agree...,"The effects were poor at times, and you could make out the stunt man in one or two shots. Even for a kids move the story line was very poor and did at times seem to come close to racism. They could have made up for the lack of action with more laughs. THE only thing good about this movie was the young actor, Jamie, who did a great, believable, job in his role. (Although my youngest did find it odd that a wild boy-living with wolves since he was a toddler was able to speak in one scene.)"
1,quite boring..,"the young actor is great in this movie, but the film itself is non-exciting and a bit boring.***"
2,Not As Good As Expected,"We have been enjoying the Archipelago Havana, and Archipelago Stonehenge candles for some time. We had expectations that this Bergamot Tobacco candle would be up to par with our previous candles. The Bergamot Tobacco has very little scent compared to the others. It is more expensive and not near as good as we anticipated. I recommend the Archipelago Stonehenge to anyone who is looking for a terrific scented candle. The Havana is also very nice."
3,Pretty good but beware one little thing,"This item is pretty nice. The only problem we had with it is the logo on top is not smooth. It's very strange. Like when cheap particle board gets wet and expands, there is this rough, raised circle around the logo but under the paint. We never bothered to contact the manufacturer to see if we got a bad one.Overall, it's not a bad product. The rest of it is in great shape and it is easy to assemble and comes well packaged. But if any form of blemish on something that should be smooth offends you, you may want to call the manufacturer first to see if they are all like that."
3,Great songs- Not as bad as the other guys says,"I bought it and I do play... since '87. The recording is good and the songs are played good. I thought that Valse Crillo was a little slow but still good. The recording is modern therefore it sounds much better than an old Bream recording. Worth the cash, imo."
1,unrealistic and depressing,"Ok, I realize novels aren't necessarily realistic. And perfect-looking marriages do break up unexpectedly and for no apparent reason. But how often does a perfect, gorgeous man willing to take on a divorcee and her two small children show up immediately? Even if it happens, it's not interesting. Even worse is the other sister's dilemma... she wants a mature responsible husband instead of her flighty Peter Pan boyfriend. In the end she gives up and settles for the boyfriend, who has not changed at all. She apparently needs more self-esteem or she would not accept the unacceptable. Does anyone learn or grow in this book? It seems Martha doesn't have to, and Eliza just regresses. A depressing book, which doesn't ring true to real life."
2,going directly into the Goodwill pile,"Very slow moving in the beginning. The main character, Martha explains her feelings and thought processes . . . redundantly. I thought that the 2 sisters would actually be switching places . . . like twins. But they only switched lives metaphorically. Generally predictable with a completely unrealistic Hollywood ending. The only thing it had going for it . . . the English slang. But the word ""whilst"" seems to be overused."
3,"Enjoyable, heartwarming and funny","Although the plot is dead-on predictable, I still found it to be an enjoyable, heartwarming and funny story. I liked both sisters, Martha and Eliza, and what they went through was fairly realistic and relatable. I would definitely read other titles by this author in the future."
2,Not Bad!,"The best albums by Grinderswitch are Macon Tracks and Pullin' Together. Stick with the studio albums. This live CD is good, not great."
4,dont wait !,"I waited to get this because I thaught it was some kind of compilation but its not. Its a great reunion album of sorts. The line up changes on different songs but its made up of past and present members of Jane. Peter Panka's Jane takes on most of the bulk and you get vocals from Charly Macher, Klaus Hess, Martin Hesse and others. And you get some old and new unreleased live cuts. All this makes a nice treat for Jane fans.Dont wait, get it now if your hip to the Jane legacy."
1,STEVE HARRIS CAN'T PRODUCE ....,"I'm a huge MAIDEN fan. After Adrian left, I never tought the band would fall so hard ... Steve Harris doens't kniow how to produce a metal album, and this was clear in the awful sound in ""NO PRAYER"" and in thsi ""FEAR..."". LEt's analyse the songs:* SHEER FILLERS, BELOW MAIDEN STANDARD HIGH QUALITY: - The Apparition, Weekend Warrior, Judas My Guide, Chains of Misery, Wasting Love, Childhood's End, Fear is The Key and From Here To Eternity ( where they shamelessly copied their own ""HOLY SMOKE"" );* Average songs: Be Quick or Be Dead* Great song: Afraid To Shoot Strangers* Classic ( still present in their live set ): Fear of the DarkYou take a Maiden album with so few good tunes and say it is great... Go figure ..."
2,too slow for metal,sorry but I think it realy sucks it was the first iron madien cd I ever got and it almost made me think the band sucked. it is 2 slow for me and my metal needs.
3,Maiden stuggles on without Adrian Smith,"This is the last studio album with long-time frontman Bruce Dickinson, who left August of 1993. I think that this album is overall a pretty good album, and it is a lot better than No Prayer for the Dying. There are some really good songs on this album such as Be Quick Or Be Dead, From Here to Eternity, Afraid to Shoot Strangers and Fear of the Dark. There are also a couple of bad songs like Fear is the Key and The Apparation. On Fear of the Dark, you can see that Maiden gained back SOME of thier greatness that they lost on No Prayer for the Dying. However, can see that they are struggling to regain their greatness they had in the early eighties, and the Departure of guitarist Adrian Smith is what has hurt the badn the most."
2,Very dissapointing for Maiden....,"I bought this cd in hopes that it would follow the same style I had seen in other maiden albums I own (Brave new world,Ed hunter, Piece of mind). However, the first time I listened to this one, my first thought was that maiden has gone soft. The only songs I enjoyed are ""Fear of the Dark"" and ""Be quick or be dead"". This one seems very mellow and pales in comparison to other albums."
4,Very Good,"I would say this album deserves 5 stars, but I think ""The Apparition"" and ""Weekend Warrior"" are worthless songs. ""Fear Is The Key"" isn't something I'm into either. Still, there are great songs on this album, like ""Be Quick Or Be Dead"", ""Childhood's End"", ""Judas Be My Guide"", ""Afraid To Shoot Strangers"", and ""Fear Of The Dark"". ""Wasting Love"" is very good too. ""The Fugitive"", ""Chains Of Misery"" and ""From Here To Eternity"" are good songs, but not great. I think that this album is a lot better than No Prayer For The Dying, and the best album they released until Dance Of Death."
4,Underrated,"You have to give this cd a chance. This isnt' one of those cds where you jump right in. Give it some time and you ll start to love it. The five best songs are Afraid to Shoot Strangers, The Fugitive, From here to Eternity, Chains of Misery, and fear of the dark however none of the tracks are bad."
3,A decent transition...,"Unlike the very uneven'No Prayer...',Maiden's 1992 opus was a recovery of power and inspiration,but still below the level of their glorious 1979-1988 era.Bruce's last album with the band,it had many hints of their slight change of direction with Blaze Bayley fronting.Thorough Maiden collectors will want this one."
3,AVERAGE MAIDEN ALBUM,"This is the best (or less worse) albun in MAiden's Janick Gers age. The tittle track is one of their best of all times. ""Afraid To Shoot Strangers "" is a classic. But there are horrible tunes, like ""THe APPARITION"" and the cheesy ""Wasted Love"" (it is an horrible ballad. I like ballads, but this one is just bad written,that's all). In general it is a forgettable album."
4,One of the best...,Fear of the dark was the first metal album i bought and since then I am a fun of heavy metal. It contains some excelent songs and it's the best choice for beginers. UP THE IRONS!!!
4,It's really a good album!,"I think that everyone should stop bashing this album!! Sure, some songs suck, but there are lots of great songs on it. Fear of the Dark is one of my fav Maiden songs, and Judas be my guide is rad too. Forget everyone, this is a must for REAL Maiden fans. UP THE IRONS!!!"
3,We miss you Adrian!,"This is Maiden's second album without Adrian, and their struggle continues. Although a lot better than ""No Prayer for the Dying"", the cracks in Iron Maiden's armor are showing. There are some great songs on here like ""Be Quick or Be Dead"" ""Fear of the Dark"" and ""Afraid to Shoot Strangers"" but there is a lot of filler here like ""Fear is the Key"" and ""The Apparation"". Although this album was a disaster in the states, and an overall poor effort, this was nothing compared to they next two studio outputs."
4,Fear of Bruce Dickinson's voice,"My third Iron Maiden album. I really like this album, the songs are almost all good. But 4 of them are not really Iron Maiden songs: Fear Is The Key, From Here To Eternity, The Apparation and Weekend Warrior. That's too bad for them, cause 4 is a lot, so it might just destroy their image. But I still like the album, and a 4-star rating is enough I guess. Unfortunately, Bruce seems to like to screw with his voice, he sings like an old woman. Sorry for that offensive language, but he is much better on albums before 1990.Let's have a closer look at the album:Be Quick Or Be Dead: 10/10From Here To Eternity: 8/10 (I know I mensioned it, but it's still good)Afraid To Shoot Strangers: 10/10Fear Is The Key: 6/10Childhood's End: 8/10Wasting Love: 8/10 (ballad)The Fugitive: 9/10Chains Of Misery: 9/10The Apparation: 7/10Judas Be My Guide: 10/10Weekend Warrior: 6/10Fear Of The Dark: 10/10"
2,What is this?,"Dickinson, always aware of what is going on in the muscial scenario, quited at the right time. What is this on this album? Mediocre, horrible songs like ""Wasted Love"", ""The Apparition"", mescled with the classic tittle track. Guitarrist Jannick Gers added almost nothing to the band, and the reflect is this."
3,"Shows Maiden's vast range, yet suffers from poor production","This cd was a great departure from what many Iron Maiden fans consider thier worst Dickinson era cd- 1990's No PRayer. Jannick Gers infuses a fresh direction for 1990's MAiden (vs 80's prog rock) with songs like the mellow Wasting Love and the hard rocking Be Quick. Also includes 2 Steve Harris epics, Afraid To Shoot Strangers, which shows both Harris' strenghths (intellegent, relevent lyrics, well written in sections) and short comings (very poor time change transitions); and the closing title track. While this cd has soem great songs (arguably Maiden's best 1990's effort, unless you could put Bruce Dickinson on 1995's The X Factor), Steve HArris' producing abilitys were stil in thier infant stages. The drums sound like trash bags, the bass has no bass, and the keyboards in what seems to be Maiden tradition, are mixed too low. A worthwhile buy, but try to hear the songs live..."
2,LACKLUSTER ALBUM,"This is clearly one of the worst albums by Iron Maiden. Bruce Dickinson seemed bored with the material. Many of the songs are monotonous and boring. The only real standout songs on the album are ""Fear of the Dark"", ""Afraid to Shoot Strangers"" and ""The Fugitive"". Iron Maiden would bounce back later with ""The X Factor""."
5,Brilliant!,"This album just proves that Iron Maiden are the Lords Of Metal. It has some of the most brilliant and creative melody to ever exist in any metal album! The album sounds better than the old albums with Adrian Smith! It has Great unforgettable tracks like Wasting Love, Afraid to Shoot Strangers, Chains of Misery, The Fugitive etc (The whole album is just amazing really!) Not to mention the greatest finishing track in history, Fear of the dark!"
4,Great album by Maiden.,"Not one of Maiden's best albums, but rather one of their better ones. I pity the fool who doesn't like the title track and I definetly pity the fool who does not like ""Afraid To Shoot Strangers,"" partically because those songs are my favorites from this album. I like every song on this album except for ""Fear Is The Key"" which is stupid. If anybody reads this review, I say don't be afraid to get this album...at least until you get all of Maiden's golden-era albums first. The Number Of The Beast, 7th Son, etc."
1,this is the worst maiden album that features Bruce Dickinson,"when i bought this album several years ago, i had recently become a fan of Iron Maiden. having heard plenty of the classic maiden stuff, i bought this album. what a mistake! this cd,(with the exception of tracks 1&2) was awful. i had fallen in love with maiden's fabulous guitars and songwriting,but this album,(as well as all of those after powerslave)was a huge disapointment. do not buy this record."
2,True Maiden fans...Skip this one,"This album is for the most part uninspired. With songs like ""Weekend Warrior"" and ""Chains of misery"",It is obvious that this is not the maiden we remember from the 80's.The vocal effort is clearly lacking on Bruce's part.The only songs on this album that remain true to Maiden are ""Childhoods end"" and ""Afraid to shoot strangers"". To put it Bluntly this album is Maidens worst."
4,good album!,"The few songs that are excellent on this album are very good.The ones that are not as good are still ok.The worst ones (3-4 of them) are still not bad.I think Iron Maiden is totaly awsome, but I like the older albums way better (I'm listening to a 1982 Maiden album as I type this).If you get this, keep in mind that the songs that sound stupid get faster and better,way better!"
3,Nod Bad...But not all that good,"It is not often that a band makes a real stinker albumn then comes back with a better one...Maiden must have seen the mistake they made with NPFTD and did their best to correct it....To bad they Diddnt.Though Fear of the Dark is leaps and bounds better than their previous effort...It still missed the mark.Seems like they were trying to record enough classic sounding songs to appease the ""real"" maiden fans,at the same time they were trying to write songs for the ""Glam"" crowd.Diddnt work...Not a bad CD...But Maiden has done alot better."
4,"Iron Maiden ""Fear Of The Dark""","Alot of people constantly put down Maiden cd's of the 90's but I have to say this is a solid hevay hitting album. Sure its not the greatest but its pretty damn good and definetly worth getting. It contains one of Maidens greatest songs ""Be Quick Or Be Dead"", other real good songs on the album are ""Afraid To Shoot Strangers"", ""From here To Eternity"" and ""The Fugitive"". So if you are a true Maiden fan youll definetly get this album cause its really worth it."
4,Fear of Genius,"Let me preface this review by stating that I feel weel qualified in reviewing this album since I have been listening to metal/hard rock since 1976. I have been listening to Maiden since '79. This album is fantastic overall. There are a few weak moments, but the superior songs far outnumber those lapses. The main problem is the absence of Adrian Smith and a thin production which makes Nicko's drums sound like a machine. Janick's studio work is fair (his live show is cheesy and annoying). It takes a lot of getting used to, but the lyrics and time changes are excellent overall. This is definitely not their best work, but still very enjoyable and with some great tunes which would have benefitted from Adrian and a more classical production (like the wicker man type of sound). Up the Irons, lads..........."
1,My least favourite Maiden album...,"Never could get on with this album. I thought No Prayer For The Dying was average (a shock for a Maiden fan from the old days) but this one is downright awful. I was moderately hopeful when the single of Be Quick Or Be Dead was released, but this album crushed those hopes. Some of the vocals are okay (Childhood's End) and the title track finally made some kind of sense after seeing it live...but no thanks."
1,The once great musically giant has become this?,"I'm a huge fan of Iron Maiden, and I bought this album early on when I first started getting into them and it turned me off for a while. It's lacking something, but I can't quite pin it (cough!- Bruce's voice- cough Adrian Smith- Cough! Cough!- Good songwriting- Cough!).1. Be Quick or Be Dead (10/10) A great opener like classics ""Invaders"" and ""Aces High""2. From Here to Eternity (8/10) Hell ain't a bad place. But this album is.3. Afraid to Shoot Strangers (5/10) I cringe.4. Fear Is the Key (4/10) I cringe some more.5. Childhood's End (5/106. Wasting Love (5/10)7. Fugitive (5/10)8. Chains of Misery (4/10)9. Apparition (7/10)10. Judas Be My Guide (4/10)11. Weekend Warrior (2/10 Make it stop12. Fear of the Dark (9/10) The best Iron Maiden song ever!!! Bar-none it's a classic! On a terrible album. But this version is terrible compared to any time they played it live. There is something wrong with Bruce's voice."
4,Underrated Gem.,"Bruce Dickinson started to change vocally here but it was their mid career and it was before the band really aged. It has some darker lyrics and a more mature sound to it. It starts off with a fast opening track, Be Quick or Be Dead which is very heavy and has a lot of speed metal in it. A few songs are slower and have a progressive sound to them with a dated early '90s production which gives the album a classic sound. It has some slower paced songs with progressive influences but it's mostly straight forward heavy metal and more stripped down than Seventh Son. The lyrics improved a lot after their lackluster effort, No Prayer For The Dying. Fear Of the Dark is a truly underrated album and I still listen to it regularly. Chains Of Misery, The Apparition, The Fugitive and Fear Is the Key are my favorites."
2,Lackluster Effort,"By far not Iron Maidens best material, some riffs and songs are good, but it looks like they were in a rush to complete this project and leaves you feeling like they fell short of what an Irom Maiden fan would expect from such a great metal band."
2,weak maiden,"weakest maiden album along with 'dance of death,' and 'brave new morld' if you want great maiden check out powerslave."
2,FEAR OF THE DARK,BE QUICK OR BE DEAD-5/10FROM HERE TO ETERNITY-2/10AFRAID TO SHOOT STRANGERS-3/10FEAR IS THE KEY-5/10CHILDHOOD'S END-4/10WASTING LOVE-4/10THE FUGITIVE-5/10CHAINS OF MISERY-6/10THE APPARITION-4/10JUDAS BE MY GUIDE-6/10WEEKEND WARRIOR-5/10FEAR OF THE DARK-7/10
4,Worth a listen or two,"I was skeptical about this disc due to the mixed reviews, however, it's pretty solid. Fear of the Dark is a good track, and as usual the musicianship is top notch."
5,amazing soung brings me to the world full of rock spirit,"six year ago, the CD at the first time took me to the fantastic rock world. It combines speed and melody with deep-rooted thought and can be regared as an elaborated first-class CD although some of my friends refuse to accept it.It fits to my taste:speedy-melody music"
1,AMAZING DECLINE,"This was the last studio album featuring Dickinson before hje came back to BRAVE NEW WORLD. The signals of strain are clear for all to see here. My God, what are ""WEEKEND WARRIOR"" and ""THE APPARITION"" ??!! Two of the wrost Maiden songs in the same CD !! And what about WASTED LOVE ??!! Nothing at all against ballads, but this one is just horrible !!! And what to say about Nicko's drums ?? Where did they take this sound from ?? It killed all the majestry fom Nicko's playing.. Maiden to be forgotten. And FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, a copy of HOLY SMOKE ??!!! Well, I sold my copy of this CD some days ago, and that's why I'm writing this sad review, to make plain for all to see how Maiden declined forever..."
3,better than the last one.,"I must agree with many that this one is better than the last one. At least they didn't do a whole cd of speed metal. Just 0ne song of that style. I didn't dislike this one as much as I did ""no prayer for the dying'. It's got alot of diversity to it but to be fair it's not going to be place up there with their first seven releases in most peoples ears or eyes. It's a good enough though not to be as disliked by fans as 'no prayer for the dying' was. It was a step back into the right direction to a degree and they had better production values by far than their previous release. It's not great but it's good and that's better than most thrash, speed or nu metal by far. If this wasn't maiden I would give it four stars because it's more average than most of their stuff."
4,Underrated....,"I don't know why most people dislike this album. Sure it isn't a classic like ""Number of the Beast"" or ""Powerslave"", but it's still a solid album. It is one of the first Maiden albums I ever heard so maybe that's why i like it so much. Anyway, I would still recommend checking it out..."
3,classic but changes added new things to the standard recipe.,"this cd had some old school classic maiden songs on it but with a long career come challenges staying fresh and how to compare to the newer bands.maiden are survivers but not experts they tried to pick up the pace with be quick or be dead(an attempt to match up to thrash style?) not them but they do stand their groung on many song the classic fear of the dark,from her to eternity and still seam to lose groung on quite a few song (trying to expertment with new things) to boost their sales."
4,"Not the best , but it certainly doesn't suck!","Many are complaining that this doesn't sound like a Maiden album and a lot of the songs are out of character for them. That's true but that doesn't mean the material is weak - just different. If you like Bruce's solo stuff then you'll love this album because that's mostly what you get. To me, the last four songs are the best, maybe just because the two songs before those are pretty bad... but it really kicks into high gear with The Apparition, Judas Be My Guide, Weekend Warrior, and Fear of the Dark. A fantastic finish to an album that seriously drags in the middle portion. Out of the twelve songs, four should have been left out, which would give you the Maiden you're used to - an album with eight classic tracks."
3,"Not their best, not their worst...","Ok, the production is somewhat patchy, and a few of the songs should have been b-sides, but after No Prayer, this was a godsend. With new lyrical direction, as evidenced in songs like Wasting Love and Afraid to Shoot Strangers, and classics like Fear of the Dark, it's still light years ahead of what most other bands only dream of producing. I don't think Fear is the Key or the Fugitive should have been on there, and again, the production could have used some work, but it's still not as bad an album as many say."
2,A SHADOW OF THE ONCE GREAT BEAST!!,"This was Maiden's worst until Steve hired Blaze!! The production is poor, Bruce's vocals are his WORST ever, and the songs are just LACKING!! Bruce did well to leave this sinking ship! Steve is really killing this ONCE great band. If not for ""Childhood's End"", this cd would have NO stars!! Don't waste your money!!"
1,never liked this one.,"bought this when it was first released. didn't like it back then, and don't like now. Weak maiden album."
2,wheres adrian?,I cant imagine how anyone could think Janick Gers is maiden quaility. I find his guitar sound irritating and flashy. What a waste. Otherwise maidens remaining members are hangin in there.
3,A lack of closeness of the band.,"Its real obvious after one listens to this cd, that what has happened to the guys after ""Somewhere in time"" is that the success that they found, that they rightly deserved has softened them, and dimmed the great light that they once opened the door way to.Laziness? more likely seperate lives lived by the band, where they all live in vastly different areas on the Earth with that many different interests is most probably the culprit.Whatever the case, the guys suck on this one, plain and simple.be quick or be deadfrom here to eternity...they are lucky Bon isnt alive!Fear of the darkJudas be my guide? Yea I guess maybe...nothing special thats for sure.. too bad a band with this much potential is playing like sophmores.Wake up guys we miss the REAL IRON MAIDEN!"
3,Five tracks too far,"Remove the filler songs Fear is the Key, Childhood's End, The Fugitive, The Apparition, and Weekend Warrior and you have a great eight-track hard rock/metal album. Unfortunately, these weak tracks bring the album down and prolong it to an unreasonable 13 tracks, which is too much for a band like Iron Maiden, who always do better with eight or nine track albums. Overall though, Fear of the Dark is an okay album, and easily the best of Maiden's 90s efforts."
2,Hell IS here,"Here to Eternity? Weekend Warrior? Give me a break! Pretty Weak.... I hate the stupid bar band stuff. Maiden wrote smarter songs before.Anything From the 80's would suit better if you are new to Maiden.... There was no growth here at all. There are a couple goodies here too. BE quick is OK, Fear of is OK, Just not enough to make it worthwhile. Try Brave New World. Adrian is back and it has many better songs"
2,So here they go again...,"If I wasn't such a nice guy, I'd say that Iron Maiden (i.e. Steve Harris) have written the same song over and over again with a little variation from time to time. And this release ""Fear of the dark"" is no exception. The title track is by far the best song but that doesn't really say much. ""Fear of the dark"" is mainly for [real]Maiden fans, others will find much more pleasure in earlier efforts like ""The number of the beast"" or ""Piece of mind""."
3,Well-written but out-of-date and not worth the money,"Though well-written and thorough, I found many links and/or suggestions to be out of date already. Provides good advice about mailing lists, but I think there are better books at a much lower price out there."
2,Dissapointing,"If you've been too long surfing the Internet, the Handbook seems obvious. There's nothing for the intermediate or advanced Net user."
5,A book everyone should read!!!!,"I started reading Taylor Caldwell in the '70's. This is my favorite TC book without a doubt.I read it at least once a year. It's a shame her books are no longer in print. I have purchased this used and cherish it. I have also given used copies as gifts. If you want to read a bookthat is immensely moving and very inspirational, I recommend ""The Listener"". I guarantee you itwill be time well spent. The beauty of it is, each chapter is its own story. If you are unable toread this is one sitting, it is easy to stop at the end of a chapter and resume at a later time.Please take the time to read this book. Everyone should!"
4,Motown's greatest artists,I liked the choice of choosing to sing with or without the artist that's all I have to say I liked it
4,Norelco 710RL Heads,I was able to upgrade an older electric Shaver to like new performance.New heads work well..... But heads are pricey..... An OK buy
1,Doesn't Mesh,"I have a Philips Norelco which this product claims to work with. I ordered these because I lost just one of my blades when cleaning it. They came quickly, but when I looked at it, it was obviously a bit different than my other blades. When I put it in, it kind of worked, but the back is different, so it would make a strange noise when touching the motor. With the aid of the other two blades, it still gets the job done, it's just annoying how it doesn't quite mesh right."
5,A great way of saving from a new electirc razor purchase!,I recomend this product to any man who is scratching or burning his face with his old electric razor. This will give you twice the life of your shaver. Very competitive prices available at Amazon.com. Fast and in this case FREE delivery!
5,Best Sanborn Album Ever,This album introduced me to the world of Contemporary Jazz. I remember buying it by chance and it changed my musical life. I have seen Sanborn 3X and have owned most of his work from vinyl to cassette now to CD. I have purchased numerous copies of this album to give as gifts to friends and family. I have watched his career closely and he's still Number One to me. I had a dog for many years named 'Sanborn' as well.
3,good stuff,"Well, I had to hear more of them after I ordered Punch De Beat, and it was pretty good. The album itself isn't as ""dark"" as Punch De Beat and has waaaay more covers but it was still pretty good. The tracks ""Blues for Tears""""blondie"" and ""balla balla"" were by far my favorites, but this is definitely for fans only."
4,The way a Telecaster was meant to be played.,"The creator of the guitar sound that drove the Commander Cody's ""Hot Rod Lincoln,"" Bill Kirchen defines truck-a-billy with this recording."
3,Royal Shredder,A little disapointing compared to my old one but it is doing the job. I have not had any problems with it outside of the noise when shredding. I can live with it.
4,big eddie muphey fan,"I think with a combination of eddie muphey and martin lawrence you have a hit their alone,There is no need to write a script for these two as i think they could make anybody laugh for hours by them selves. but the writers have done a great job writing a class film to go with two class actors. this is a film i would recoment to all my friends."
3,Not as I was hoping,"This was meant to be a birthday present and when he opened it, it looked somewhat bootlegg. A good one but bootlegg nonetheless. So I am not a satisfied customer this time."
4,Murphy's best since the Nutty Professor......,"I watched Life last night on DVD and found it entertaining and hilarious. This light hearted comedy takes Murphy and Lawrence from 1930s Harlem to the Mississippi prison system. Through the decades, their antics, hard luck and views on life kept me laughing from start to finish. I would rank this as one the best comedies of 1999."
2,Dissatisfied with item,The item was very scratched and had food particles dried up on it. I hope from this point on you will clean and buff the movies.
4,Eddie is hilarious!!,"This is a wonderful movie. Eddie Murphy is totally hilarious in this movie. Its basically about two guys (Eddie and Martin) who have to serve a life sentence in jail for a crime in which they were framed. Its about them forming a bond of friendship, but as you will see this takes years. Great effects on ageing Martin and Eddie in different stages of their lives. The only bad thing about this film was that it tended to drag at certian points. This type of movie reminds me of Oh Brother Where Art Thou with its southern humor and setting in the past. I highly recommend both of these movies."
2,NO Chemistry&Very Average,Eddie Murphy&Martin Lawrence just don't click on this Average Film.My Only Real Highlight was Seeing The Funkateer Rick James.This Film SHould Have Been The Biggest Event of The Year.With All The Talent Involved.but it isn't Happening at all.I Prefer Murphy&Lawrence in Boomering.
1,Life,"The movie did not work, I e-mailed the person who sold it to me and never heard from them. So I recieved a Christmas gift for my son that would not play when he opened it and I was out the money I spent!!! Not very happy, may never order DVD or CD's from site again."
1,Bad movie blues!,"This movie had great reviews, but, in all reality, it is horrible... horrible ending, horrible story, stupid stuff. Good actors, bad movie!"
1,THIS IS LIFE?,This movie was a complete waste of time. It was 1hr and 49min but it felt much longer because it shows Eddie and Martin grow old in the prison. I felt that this movie was not funny or entertaining. Sure there were some mild belly laughs but no laugh out loud laughs that allot of people long for. Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence were awful. I think they were desperate for a movie role. This movie was a great dissapointment to me. Take my word for it Life sucks. You will have waste your money on a movie about stupidity.
5,Great DVD,This is a very funny DVD. I love purchasing items from Amazon. They are always in great condition.
1,did not like this video,everyone at my work loves this movie so i purchased it but did not like the humor in at all
2,Could have been funny,"I had high expectations for this movie and sadly I was disappointed with the overall movie. While it was entertaining at times, the chemistry between Murphy and Lawrence just wasn't present. Both men are great comedic actors but this film did not display those talents. There were only a few funny moments and the movie seemed to drag at times."
4,Sad...but Funny,"Life is very sad , how two men are put into prison for life for nothing they done, but its not a movie that you cry over because its very funny. Murphy played a very good Ray Gibson , because he actually became Ray Gibson. Lawerance , he was alright, but to me he still acts like his character Martin Payne , at his show Martin, execpt more serious. So five stars for Murphy, Lawerance 4.5 stars."
5,This is the south if you don't know,This movie is worth seening for the one's that have not seen it. The other reviewer that rated this movie under a 4 star need to see it again and get the plot of the movie. If you can't get it let me tell you. The is the way that Afican-American got treated in that time and still is being treated that way. Serving time for something they didn't comment. If you don't get the plot now that just tells the other reviewer about yourself.
3,"Disappointing movie, superb DVD","Before I saw the movie I thought this would be a very funny and good movie. This because of the outstanding heroic and funny cast of Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy. But when I saw the movie I was very disappointed, because it was rarely funny and more a dramatic movie. And I think the talents of these normally ( not always ) funny comedians/actors wasn't used at all in this movie. In the movie there are some funny parts but you can count them on one hand. And I would think that they had the intention of making a comedy instead of a drama. But I would like to comment the make-op effects in this movie, because these were really good. The reason that I give this movie 3 stars is because of the DVD. The DVD is superb with a real fine picture quality and a very good sound quality. It is also packed with a lot of extra features and that makes this DVD after all worth a little look. My conclusion is the DVD a plus, the movie a minus."
3,Warm and funny drama of friendship,Both Murphy and Lawrence are quite fine in this warm and funny drama about a lifelong friendship behind the bars of a Southern prison camp during the depression. The make-up as they slowly age was deservedly Oscar-nommed. Both prove here they are fine actors as well as fine comedians. This is not an extraordinary work but it is quite competent and entertaining. Worth a watch.
5,That's Life,"I loved this movie . The characters are great and to see people age during incarceration was quite a journey.Lots of hidden metaphors about making bad judgements , the company one keeps and the horror of entrapment .Makes one want to live their life on the outside joyfully.A fan"
4,They're Nuts,This movie had me in stitches! Eddy Murphy alone is bad enough. But Eddy and Martin Lawrence together? haha These are two great comedians! I dont know how they got that movie completed without busting a gut!! BUY IT!
5,I loved this movie,"I dont know why everyone else is saying that this movie is no good just because it isnt a ""straight up"" comedy. They obviously missed the whole point of the movie. This is a movie about two guys- Murphy and Lawrence- who are framed for murder and sentenced to LIFE in prison. I loved it because of the mix of drama and comedy and because of how realistic it was. Don't get me wrong- there were some funny parts.(for example, when Martin Lawrence runs to steal the pie, and after taking the first bite, has to scream because it is too hot) Also, the special effect makeup couldn't have been better."
3,Maybe a little Neal Stephenson-esque,"While a great and incredibly imaginative book, I couldn't help but feel that the story got too big for Stross to give it a fulfilling ending. Nonetheless, I have never before seen the implications of the singularity told in such a clear way."
2,Jargon porn.,"I was looking forward to reading this one, but in the end I barely made it through. Stross shovels on an unbelievable amount of jargon from page one, and that's all there really ever is. I never got the sense that Stross was ever interested in making this more than an bolted together mess of the current hot topics in Sci Fi.The characters are two dimensional, poorly formed and motivated, and undergo almost no development. You never get the sense that they're anything more than jargon mouthpieces - with the one exception, they largely march through the plot, never really taking in, reacting to, or feeling anything. The bold print passages that link what I'm assuming were formerly independent short stories seem rushed. And don't even get me started on the endless run-on sentences...In the end, I'd hoped for a lot more given the hype surrounding this book."
1,Didn't bother to finish it,"I attempted to read this, got about 60 pages in and decided that it wasn't worth the effort. I didn't like the main character, didn't care what happened to him and wasn't impressed with the authors attempts to think of 17 radical ideas before breakfast and then include them all in the book. The first several chapters read instead like short stories that were a showcase of all the amazing ideas that the author came up with but were only thinly linked with the other chapters leaving the plot somewhat disjointed and incoherant. I've mentioned in other reviews that it takes a fair bit for me to not finish a book once started but so far i've been unable to convince myself to finish two Charles Stross books."
2,"Meme keywords, cut and paste",Next to no science in this science fiction- it's mostly a world of reimagined legal and business systems that don't hold even fictional water. As for the style- meme spew.
3,"Starts great, peters out.","The first third of this book is some of the most head-exploding wildly visionary futurism you'll ever see in a novel, fully rivaling Neuromancer or The Diamond Age. The second part is not bad but slows down a bit, as it fails to really fully explore the possibilities of the posthumanism it postulates (apologies for the alliteration). The third part contains essentially no new ideas, and is merely a reshuffling of characters that are by now as used up as yesterday's technologies."
2,Started out somewhat OK; then the Singularity happened.,"Started out somewhat OK. Sometimes the ""humor"" reached Neal Stephenson lows, but it wasn't nearly as annoying. Then the Singularity happened, and things just went downhill.I don't think I'm the right target for these ""idea"" novels. Some of the ideas can be interesting, but I'd rather read them in non-fiction, rather than have to endure bad, ""witty"", ""hip"" writing from people who don't seem to care about writing as an actual craft.For all the flack that nerds give William Gibson, at least the man can put a sentence together artfully and evocatively; something that these authors that get compared to him in the sales blurbs can't seem to do."
5,Brilliant,"I read this book a couple years ago and it stands as one of the greatest sci fi novels that I have ever read. This is the first book I read by Stross and led me to read many others. For me this one stands apart. It takes you on a technological juggernaut that leaves your brain pressed back against the occipital ridge. Obviously, the acceleration has left some readers confused and disoriented. But if you are a true fan of sci fi, then this book is for you."
3,Not my favorite Stross book,Charles Stross has two different types of science fiction that he writes. One is heavy on the science and invokes a lot of deep thought and contemplation. The other is heavy on the fiction and uses science to support a compelling story. This book is in the former mode while I prefer the latter. If you enjoy books that discuss important issues and make you think then this is the book for you. If you are more like me and read SF for easy reading to relax then give some of Stross' other books a try and they will probably be more to your liking.This is a well written book by a great author but it is not my cup of tea.
4,Entertaining read,This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. For the first half of the book I found myself somewhat disgusted by the way the author portrayed our future society and his obvious disdain for capitalism. I'm glad stuck with it though because the second half got much better and there many provocative ideas presented. Much the book was challenging the idea of what it really means to be human but he never presents his take on the matter which was somewhat frustrating. I would say is worth the read.
3,"A fascinating collection of ideas, but an incoherent mess of a story.","(I read the free version from FeedBooks on myKindle)I enjoyed this form of the ""geek rapture"", but didn't feel like there was much depth to the story or any of the characters."
1,Should have been a short story,"Yes, yes, I know...this was based off a series of short stories. Unfortunately it should have stayed that way. The writer, IMHO, tries to be too clever by simply throwing as many concepts as he can at you and ""seeing what sticks to the wall"" so-to-speak. For true, post-singularity reading joy, I'd recommend the Culture series of novels by Iain M. Banks."
3,Ultrageek,"If Stross speaks the language he writes, he might be your geekiest best friend. Nearly every sentence is packed with hard tech blather. Many of the terms are invented or spliced together in pseudo-meaning. There are very few clear explanations of the geeky phrasings; you are supposed to infer meaning from context. So, are ""transhumans"" and ""orthohumans,"" a couple of paragraphs apart, different constructs? Alas, the surrounding context itself is loaded with geekspeak, so readers have unpleasant options--put up with it; invent your own meanings; or put the book down.Stross offers some interesting plots and subplots here, but the vocabulary noise is so high that I found it a dull burden to slog through to the end."
4,"Charles Stross, Body of Work","Accelerado is an excellent book but not one of Stross's best. For Fantasy adventure I recommend Merchant Prince series while Singularity Sky and Glasshouse are still his best SCI-FI works. I think it largely comes down to accessiblility. Accelerado is a very ambitious and discusses many ideas and concepts that are an excellent and unique view of the future but all the same very difficult to 'get your head around'. If you have read the other Stross, this is a must read. Otherwise save this one for the end of your reading list."
1,Horrible Book,"This book reminds me of the people who throw around fancy words without any real depth to their knowledge. If you want a book packed with techno babble but no interesting plot, then this is for you. And no, this isn't packed with meaningful techno speak that is just above my head - he references complex sounding fields constantly when describing the future, but then doesn't say how they are applied or what they do - he just throws out the words.If you want techno-babble that is creative and intelligent, look into Peter F. Hamilton."
1,Dry sci-fi...sigh,"A mishmash of the latest techie memes, linearly extrapolated into...well, NOTHING. One can almost see Mr. Stross checking off items on his list of technologies as he writes. Sci-fi guys, study nonlinearity and chaos, then crank up your imaginations, please."
3,recommended for accelerationistas!,"Stross seems to share some of the literary memenome as Stephenson and Doctorow. The prose style (especially early on in the text) felt a bit like Snow Crash; those vivid bits of lurid ephemera, that nearly comic book pacing, every tawdry details competing for your attention right alongside the critical core. And like Cory Doctorow on crystal meth, every ten pages bombards you with some prosaically twisted huge new idea (i.e., what would Islamic scholars have to say about bacon built molecule-by-molecule by nanobots instead of cut from a pig?)Accelerando takes us on a wild ride through a technologically force-fed, self-propelled post-evolutionary end-stage of humanity. And Stross isn't afraid to ""go there"" with any its implications. Overall, not the ""wow!"" novel I'd heard it would be but still an enjoyable piece of speculative fiction with some razor sharp wit."
2,Very very bad.,"Maybe the first third of this book could be described as fairly interesting. The last half is a massive slog through very boring and seemingly random characters saying and doing fairly ad hoc and meaningless things.At times, it sounds like the author is simply spewing out random ideas through whichever random character he chooses to use at that moment. The character development is absolutely horrendous. By the end, I couldn't care less what happened to any of them -- it was like some bad episode of Lost wherein people just go back and forth on the island, pop out unexpectedly, and say random things to each other...I _hate_ to get into a book and then feel so utterly put off that I don't want to finish it. Unfortunately, that is what happened in this case. Don't bother trying to read this. Really."
1,terrible writing,I find it amazing that people can actually read this book. The writing is some of the worst I have ever experienced. There is no smooth flow. I got about 30 pages into it and just couldn't take it anymore. It seemed to be more about clever techno-phile BS than anything substantial. Avoid this book.
4,It gives you an affable headache,"This is my first Stross book. It is a fun but disorienting ride. I like the breakdown of cyberpunk, first contact and finding home description below. That neatly sums it up.Yest there were hundreds of ideas thrown at you here and it can get a bit overwhelming but it is a marvelous ride and Mr. Stross makes it all sound so possible.I didn't give it 4 stars due to the ending. Humanitys apparent fate and that of a certain Aineko are on the one hand left subotimal (which may be our fate) and on the other hand unknown. I guess I just like tidy endings and we meatbodies coming out on top."
3,Stross has an IQ of 160,"At least, 160. Perhaps verging on 170 or 180. And this is evident in every sentence. I have never ever read anybody who tries so hard to show his intellect in every sentence, in every word. If Stross could show how intelligent he is in spaces between words, he would do it. Reading Accelerando demands a portable wikipedia (I think I even spotted an all your base are belong to us reference) a great deal of Egan (who he shamelessly rips, even though he credits Vinge)and a lot of time. Read it at a pace of ten or fifteen pages per day and it will start making sense. Nice way out for the Fermi paradox, would like to see the Matrioshka brains fleshed out some more. Overall, nice Singularity effort."
2,Not my favorite Stross book so far!,"When I find an author that I like, I usually buy everything they write and devour it. Very rarely does this fail me, but with Stross I have found him very hit or miss. Singularity Sky was a hit for me. This book was not. I haven't even finished it as the characters are so whimsical and alien to me that I can't really care about their futures.To credit the people who have written positive reviews, it is CLEVER writing. The concepts are unique and interesting, but I just don't care what happens to the characters.In short, I like most of Stross' works, but this one didn't do it for me."
3,misleading ad.......,"i ordered the item in the belief that it was REALLY made in france but it turned out, after having used it once, that it was made in china. Had i not used it i would definitely have returned it. Next time i'll make sure i only buy u.s.a. products."
2,"Great single, but the rest.....","""Everything Flows"" is one of The Fannies' best-ever tracks; a great single worthy of many repeat plays. This album, however, is awful. It is downright unlistenable. Quite shocking how bad it is. Get ""Everything Flows"" on their ""Shortcut"" hits collection, and skip this. Waste of time."
5,One of the most under appreciated records ever,"The people who claim this record has poor production just dont get it. This is one of my top 5 albums of all time and I have a lot of albums. If I was on a desert island, it would be there.The grooves have worn very thin indeed. I also do not feel compelled to write these reviews, but I feel the need to talk about how great this record is. I wish more records were produced with this sound.A word of warning though. this record is very different from their others, so if you are expecting that, this aint it. But give it a chance, its way better."
2,Still an underdeveloped album.,This is the only Teenage Fanclub album I am mildy displeased with. The production of the tracks makes every song sound the same--at least the first few times you listen to them. I've given 5 stars to all their other major release albums; this one falls short.
4,Rather good,"This single was released at the same time as the ""Death to the Pixies"" album. These are simply live versions of songs heard on previous records (they were all recorded for a radio station in Chicago in 1989). If you're buying it as an import, it might not be worth it a steeper price, but there are some interesting changes from the album versions that you might want to hear."
5,An enchanting autobiography,"Under the Eye of the Clock is the autobiography of Christopher Nolan, the talented young poet with cerebral palsy. He can't walk or talk or write in the usual manner. Since Nolan lacks the use of his hands, this book like Dam-Burst of Dreams, the book of poems that preceded it, was written by means of a typing stick affixed to his head. The book succeeds both as pure artistry and as a window into the world of the disabled. Nolan has re-named himself Joseph Meehan and told his story entirely in the objectivity of the third person. This brilliant stroke allows him to avoid excessive self-pity while making his sufferings and triumphs real and deep. Nolan's use of language had earned him comparisons with James Joyce, Yeats, and Dylan Thomas. Nolan stretches the meanings and implications of words, rearranges their spelling, and even invents new ones to communicate his moods and perceptions and illuminate life, his own and those he observes, with his unique poet's sensibility."
5,Exceptional...an education for every reader,"To learn about such an exceptional poet who, without the faith of his family, would never have been revealed to the world, gives the reader a new view of people's limitations. I bought 12 copies of this book (when it was in print)and somehow have given them all away over time."
4,Classic needs subtitles,"This great classic, which I have in VHS, DVD, DVD Limited Edition (LE), and now in Blue Ray, needs subtitles in its Olive Film release. Also it's time to include more information about the making of High Noon in addition to the interview included in this Blue Ray and the DVD LE version. Else, we don't gain much purchasing the Blue Ray version. For me, High Noon is one of the greatest Westerns made in Hollywood."
3,Special Features - The Making of High Noon by Leonard Matlin,"One of the best westerns ever made.Dvd extras were average to sufficient but for Mr Matlin's final summation about the Academy Awards won by the film.He makes a factual error that Gary Cooper won his only Best Actor Oscar for this. Actually, Gary Cooper is of one of 30 Actors/Actresses to win two Academy awards for acting - his first being for the title role in Sergeant York(1941)"
4,Outstanding,"I really loved this movie when it was shown on TV a long time ago, so when the chance came up to buy it I did. The story line is easy to understand, being shot in B&W makes it stark but also blends in for the time is was set in, the actors (Cooper, Kelly, Bridges.....) make a good movie great!"
1,An aimless movie,"I watched this movie with great anticipation, however, i was so dissappointed. There was no plot, and Gary Cooper, a find actor gave one of the worst perfomances ever recorded on film. The one bright spot in this movie was Grace Kelly, and I wish this film hadn't been re-edited, which cut a lot of Grace Kelly out. The title song which won the Oscar, is played insesently, which cause it to loose whatever quality or charm it had. Overall, this movie was so utterly boring and inane that it is one of the greatly overated films of its time."
5,"FRED ZINNEMANN, OPUS 12","Four Academy awards and four Golden Globes. For once, cinema professionals weren't afraid to award an innovative and very personal film. So we may admire here one of the most daring opening credits I know of in a supposedly mainstream movie with the invasive Gary Cooper theme literally killing the important dialogue between the bad guys which, in a 1952 film, should have normally been one of the highlights of the beginning of a western. Another disturbing Zinnemann point of view, apart of course of the ruthless criticism of the ""bourgeois"" society, is the way, as Chris Jones noticed it here, Katy -Helen- Jurado steals the show against the pale and moralizing Grace -Amy- Kelly. The black-haired girl, the stranger, the mistress rubs out the all-American blonde wife. Really, 1952 cinema professionals didn't know what they were doing. Masterpiece."
5,Stanley Kramer Classic,"A Stanley Kramer classic with an all star cast. Almost shot in real time...this film contains numerous cameos by many actors of the genre. The four men at that RR station? Robert J. Wilke, Sheb Wooley, Lee Van Cleef and Ian McDonald...all out to get Cooper Gary Cooper,s acting proves again that LESS is actually MORE...much more!"
5,DO RIGHT regardless of the COST,"Each of us sees ourselves in this great movie! What will we do when someone cries for help. Run, hid, or step up to the plate! Will you do right if it costs you everything you have and even your life!A story to live by!It is normal to be afraid. Just do right when the time comes!"
3,A Dated Drama,"A classic western, and Grace Kelley is beautiful, but unfortunately, it didn't seem to capture the imagination of my eighth grade class who like their dramas fast paced and violent. Still, the drama is clean and pure and the line between the good guys and the bad guys is blurred in an interesting way. If you're over thirty, I'd recommend it."
5,"High Noon ""The Classic Good Western!""",This all time classic defines what a good western should be like! The scenes are real life even for black and white.
5,Cooper is Great,"I absolutely loved this movie. I think this film... deals morerealistically with human nature than any other films I have ever seen. I would dare say it is almost perfect. The one suggestion I would have: If you've never seen it, don't go out and see the botched TBS remake of it first. This film is an original and deserves to be seen as such...."
5,Excellent and Riveting! A Must See!!!!,"I am not a westerns fan or a fan of black and white films, but as an assignment for a Liberal Arts course I needed to watch this film and compare it to Individualism.As I was watching this film... I got so engrossed in the whole thing that I had not jotted down one single note! I had forgotten about the piece of paper!My heart actually stopped when the clock hit HIGH NOON!"
4,The Gunman is Coming,"First of all, I have seen High Noon but not this particular DVD so I can't comment on the special features.The film itself is a pretty interesting concept for a western. Gary Cooper plays a local sheriff who learns he will soon be facing a quartet of armed outlaws when the final one arrives on the noon locomotive. Grace Kelly plays his wife who happens to be a pacifist. Other performers include Katy Jurado and Lon Chaney Jr. As time ticks down, Cooper attepmts to get others in the town to join him but ultimately no one is willing. The film plays out essentially in real time on a single day and there are no gunfights until the final shootout. Overall though, the suspense and acting actually build up to the final scenes. Overall, a pretty good western."
3,forgettable,"If you like typical westerns, this may not be the movie for you. It seems like it's just dragging along. Not good, not bad. It was just forgettable."
2,May have been good in it's time but now it's just dull.,Maybe since the basic theme of this film had perhaps not been explored yet when it came out originally it might have made more of an impact back then. But having just seen it recently in 2004 I don't see anything particularly interesting. I had to fast forward through several parts because it was so mind numbingly dull. It's very eery theme song complete with odd horseclopping sounds are granted 'mega cool' but they just don't carry a dull old movie.
1,"More information, please!",Is this DVD restored in any way?This is pretty basic information missing from the Amazon review.Note on the rating: The website does not allow posting without a rating. Obviously no one here has any basis for rating the DVD as a product. The movie itself remains as good as it ever was though.I have given the DVD product a one star rating as I can not endorse a product sight unseen.
1,High Noon-The Worst Western Ever.,"Gary Cooper should have been ashamed of himself,although I like Lloyd Bridge's Performance,the movie is the Worst Western and one of the Worst Cowardly movies I have ever seen,Thanks To FellowTraveler Carl Foreman and feebleminded ilk this movie was made,Rio Bravo while not a Masterpiece is way better than this.(I would go with Mclintock! however.)This movie was an allegory for So-called ""RedBaiting"" and McCarthyism(Which 20/20 Hindsight,Joe was Right.)Spoiler:You have a movie that Cooper's character is off begging for help like The Duke himself mentioned the movie is downright UnPatriotic,the only reason people call it a masterpiece is due to double-standards,naiveity and ignornace of the Media's power at the time and even now.Simply put this movie is a Pacifist's dream and an insult to those who can read between the lines especially of Typical antiMcCarthy drivel and PoliticalPropaganda."
5,Western Classic,"Just a fabulous Western classic. Gary Cooper, Lloyd Bridges, and Grace Kelly.Grace Kelly's credit is in a diagonal list of some dozen or so other players.This western diverged from its colleagues because it is about duty, responsibility,selfishness, greed. Suspenseful and thought provoking, at 90 minutes it isfor every persons library."
1,blu-ray has no subtitles or closed captions!,"(7/23/12, 1 star for this Blu-ray release, 5 stars for the movie) Olive Films recently released a Blu-ray version of The Mountain without subtitles or closed captions and now they've done it to one of the greatest classics of American cinema. This manifest contempt by the studio for a large segment of the home video market is especially amazing considering that my DVD version of High Noon has closed captions. Has thumbing their noses at millions of cinephiles who want the option, for varied reasons, of turning on English subtitles or closed captions now become standard operating procedure at Olive Films? My hearing is still fine, but my wife is a non-native English speaker who needs English subtitles to catch all the dialog. Besides, my hearing won't always be perfect, and I can strongly empathize with the plight of those with impaired hearing. So I intend to wail until a decent studio offers a decent Blu-ray version of this magnificent western."
3,"Good, but not great","I have been on a western ""kick"" over the past few months, and have watched dozens of films from the '50s and '60s. This film is the start of a genre (""adult western"") in its own right, so is certainly a trailblazer, but falls woefully short of many that came after it. It would probably have been more suited for a 2-hour TV show than for the big screen.The plot is reasonably good, but the acting is shallow (there are many who could have done better than Cooper), and the bad guys could have been played better by a dozen or more others. The score is bad (if I hear that godawful theme song again...). The cinematography is mediocre for a Western. And, the political undertones are offensive to me; can't people keep politics out of ANYTHING?I will not add this one to my library. Instead, it will be full of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone and others who I felt captured the essence of the romanticized West."
2,Two Identical discs,"Both discs were the same, #1. Because they weren't visibly numbered, the error isn't discovered until one opens them, and they can't be returned. Amazon hasn't a phone # to call, at least not that I've found. So, the extra money for this item is lost due to Amazon's carelessness."
4,A Bit Disappointing But Good,"I don't know what I expected, but I was just a little disappointed with this. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that it is a good movie, just a little boring by modern standards. I don't know what could have made it more interesting, but it did get a little tiring watching Gary Cooper ask for help and continually getting turned down. Another thing that bothered me was the choppiness of some of the scenes, especially the fist fight scene. One second Cooper is on the ground and the next he is standing up leaning on a horse. With all that said though, the movie had a good storyline and is a good conversation starter."
1,wrong DVD settings,"hi,as the DVD was sent in the wrong DVD settings I could not watch it at all.When sending items to a different continent amazon should check the correctness of the settings."
4,Worth Watching,"Instead of throwing his badge down at the end, how bout he hands it to one the townfolk, get's on the wagon, grabs the reigns, stops and looks at the crowd, pauses, then says ""Make sure to say hello to the new sheriff for me... and be sure to let em know he'll be defending a town full of cowards."" Then he just glares at em and rides a way. Everyone looks shameful and kind of drag their feet in the dirt while looking at the ground. As he rides away a little a boy runs after him yelling, ""please shane- I mean kane, please don't go...."""
2,"Inaccurate, poorly organized.","We just returned from Dominica (October 2005), having foolishly taken this book along as our sole guide. Difficult to believe the author has visited the island, with sketchy information about much of it. Examples: Douglas Bay is described as having a shady beach, which is almost nonexistent, with half a dozen palms centered on a rocky coastal bay more than a mile long. Chaudiere pool, one of the most beautiful places on the island, is not mentioned.Poor organization is made worse by a weak index. The topics ""waterfalls"" and ""rivers"" do not appear, and the term ""Carib tribes"" is out of alphabetical order, for example.Pleasant reading for the flavor of the island, but don't take it with you for real exploration of this beautiful gem."
3,For the price...,"For the price, the cd is worth it. There's no libretto, and the sound quality isn't always great, but the singers are fairly good and it is the complete work. Maybe call it Aida for college kids..."
5,Adorable,"My girls love this toy. I have to be careful the babies' little tiny rattle doesn't get lost, but other than that, it's holding up really well to pretty constant play. My older daughter likes to undress and re-dress the babies, and their little clothes are starting to look slightly the worse for wear and won't last forever, but the stroller is still in great shape and it is still a consistently played-with favorite."
3,Omnibus,"This is an omnibus edition of 'For Love of Mother-Not,' 'The Tar-Aiym Krang' and 'Orphan Star.' It's been reprinted by SFBC."
1,Where to Flinx?,"Having read all the others in the series - and others associated to it in the Humanx universe - I too need to know if this is a new title, following on from Mid-Flinx. It's about time the threads started pulling together - Flinx and his associates, the metamorph from the 'city of the dead' and the guys from 'the howling stones' - and where the hell's Skua got to lately?"
2,Concept of Music ????????????,"If you can get past the literary labyrinthine this guy has weaved, the there is some good and interesting information to be had, hence the two stars. His constant use of elaborate words comes off indulgent, pretentious, and sonorous.If you don't know what the previous words mean, then you better buy a dictionary or thesaurus with this book, because it is cluttered with needless jargon* (* he would have used-colloquialism). Even for someone who knows these words off-hand, it can be exhausting to read this book.... It's a regular ""dog and pony show' (elaborate presentation meant to impress)..."
4,A good concise history,"Ms. Moyal's book provides a good background into the paradox which the platypus has presented history and biology with.She sets a wonderful stage for the drama of the platypus, and gives many examples to explain how national rivalry and individual competition both helped and hindered the search for the truth of this curious creature. As she presents well, the search for science in the 19th century was dominated by scientists of great egos, and by international conflict, including the napoleonic wars. Ms. Moyal examines many individuals in the search, showing some characters in great depth and others only briefly.This is certainly a baffling creature, and an interesting book. However, though the subject and the mystery both provoke curiousity, one would most likely find the book boring if he or she did not have some special interest in the topic. It is, on the whole, a well written, informative read."
4,"Breezy, light work of natural history","This is a little gem of a book. The platypus frustrated naturalists' taxonomic efforts and inspired some creative speculation about how exactly an animal that looks like a mammal might lay an egg like a bird. The scientific study of the platypus inspired heated debates, international posturing, and a surprising amount of awkwardly rhyming poetry. To be fair, this is not a weighty work and it tells more the story of European fascination with the animal than the biology and behavior of the animal itself.Still, this is a charming work of natural history and runs as a nice tangent to the broader fields of the history of science and evolutionary biology. It isn't for everyone, but it is a breezy, fun work of popular science for readers interested in the subject."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"This movie is pretty good. the battle sequences are quite thrilling even if its mostly c.g. stuff. The only predictable thing is the ending. Although, I dont know how else they could pull it off. I have to admit some of it I didnt really understand like the conversation at the end. The dialog is confusing too. as the characters talk of prophcies and events that may or may not occur. plus as the visions un-fold to all of Zion the viewer really doesnt know what it means. They mostly talk in gibberish and riddles which can mean virtually anything or any direction. Even seeing all 3 films in a row it leaves you with a feeling of kaos remianing. Of course this may be the directors intent so we never know why we spent our hard earned money."
3,Matrix Revolutions,"The Matrix Revolutions was definately a good movie that kept you thinking. After seeing the first movie, I expected alot more from Matrix Revolutions though. The first movie was such a hit that Matrix Revolutions was rushed and could have been alot better. Not to talk badly about a good movie, it just could have been alot better. As far as the widescreen edition goes, I hate it. Why buy a big T.V. and have a DVD that isn't going to cover the whole thing?"
2,Disappointing,"The original Matrix should have been left as a classic, stand-alone movie. Is there any effective follow-up to a messiah tale? (I know Frank Herbert fans would argue vehemently against me.) But Hollywood always wants to capitalize on commercial success and squeeze every dollar possible out of a concept. So many story arcs and sub plots started in the second movie are abruptly dropped or never pursued in this final installment of the trilogy. It is as if the movie makers suddenly said ""Oh @$%, we gotta finish this movie - QUICK!"" The plot shift is so drastic and unbelievable as to be almost comical.My Advice: See and love the first Matrix, then never, ever watch the following two movies. You'll be happier."
3,Was it inevitable?,"The third and final chapter. But after i saw it, i felt there should be a fourth. Why? Because the third didn't wrap up all the questions everyone has about the matrix, but in fact, created more. Also the lack of time ""in the matrix"" kicking butt and fighting agents was a factor in the bad column for this movie. I don't want to give too much away, but here it is broken down easily. Beginning-in matrix, neo-middle machine war- end-neo and smith. You barely see neo and trinity in the movie , but instead watch a ton of special FX for an hour and a half in the middle of the movie. The end shall confuse you and leave you wanting to know more, but there is no more, it is inevitable, everything that has a beginning has an end. And this end was too bland for me."
5,"one incredible, non stop trip to nirvana..................","NOT ONLY IS THIS 3RD AND FINAL (?) INSTALLMENT EVERY BIT AS GREAT AS THE MATRIX WAS IT MAY BE EVEN BETTER! THE WAR SEGMENT RANKS WITH THE BEST OF THE STAR WARS SCENES, AND NEO FINALLY GETS THE FREEDOM AND PEACE HE SO STRONGLY DESERVED! WHAT A GREAT, THOUGHT PROVOKING CLIMAX-I SAT THERE STUNNED FOR 2 HOURS! DO NOT MISS REVOLUTIONS ON DVD IT IS A KEEPER! AND THE PICTURE QUALITY AND THAT INCREDIBLE AC-3 DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND-IT ALL SOUNDS ANDS LOOK LIKE A SUPERBIT! NO EXPENSES WERE SPARED HERE TO GIVE US THE THRILLING AND UNPREDICTABLE CLIMAX IN THE BEST POSSIBLE QUALITY. BRAVO AND THANKS TO ALL CONCERNED. WHEW I AM STILL ENNERVATED!"
2,"disapointing, but go gurrl!","What happened to the amazing creativity of the Wachowski brothers? Even knowing it was a sequel I hoped for better. The holes in the dialog were filled in with cursing, the holes in the plot were filled in with explosions and when they couldn't come up with a good twist for the end they stole from Frank Herbert.If it wasn't for the few great scenes that Trinity, Niobe, and Z get I would be disapointed beyond belief. There was about 30 minutes of film that deserved four stars and the rest didn't deserve even 1. I just keep thinking I went to a theatre as dawn for this!Yet somehow even though I'm telling everyone I know it was hideous I've got to see it again. Maybe because the soundtrack broke and I was lip reading for the last ten minutes. Sigh."
3,Could have been better,"I won't go into detail, since others have taken care of that. I'll just say I'd have been a lot happier with this finale if Morpheus hadn't been whittled down to a lame, near-cameo role. The inscrutable guru of movie one is just barely more than a flunky here. He's also put on a lot of weight (but that doesn't stop Travolta). It just doesn't cohere as well as it might if the characters had more continuity. Neo, Smith and Trinity are all understandable, but Niobe seems to have been stuck in there mainly to replace Morpheus. What happened? The ending is more satisfying, tho."
2,There are no revolutions whatsoever!,"I have never been so dissapointed in my entire life! Matrix Revolutions tries, but fails, to be a none stop action flick! The movie has nothing new to offer, and it has a very limited collection of cool action scenes (with the exception of some few very notiable scenes like the Zion fight sequence). The end battle with Smith also called Super Burly Brawl is no super at all. Matrix was indeed a revolution in movie history, Reloaded had better action sequences, but Revolutions does not manage to keep it up. Its like the producers of the movie got real lazy and decided to do this movie really really quick."
2,Disappointed,"This review is based on the theatrical screener.Revolutions is certainly a departure on the theme of the first two Matrix films. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't yet seen Revolutions, but expect less philosophic puzzles and more special-effects action. I felt that the script was 'dumbed down' a tad too much for my liking - obviously in response to negative feedback from Reloaded."
1,I still have trouble sleeping after matrix 3,"I just wish someone could tell me what in the hell the brothers were thinking.Talk about watching paint dry. This movie was so bad I can't stand it. Even after months I still can't believe it. They had so much potental, they had it all. All they had to do was coast to the finish line. But instead they stopped a yard short ran backwards poured gasolene all over themselves and flicked a match...... Just horrible."
2,A let down to the series,"The first in this series was definitely the best. Of all I think the second was the worst, but it is a close running between the third and second. I would have definitely enjoyed more scenes from within the matrix and that added on with the weak and obvious story line made this one just kind of a bore for me."
1,"Wow, this movie SUCKS!!!!!!!","The first Matrix was incredible. The second one sucked but i sat through that one without too much of a fuss. But this one was basically ""Sleepless in Seattle"" with a gun here or there. Trust me, if you liked the first Matrix dont watch this one."
1,What happened to the Matrix?,"I won't be long. I've ranted enough already. This movie was terrible! The Matrix has been an obsession of mine for the past couple of years, mostly because of the philosophical ideas presented and the cool kung-fu stunts. This movie was a completely unsatisfying climax to two great, thought-provoking, and original films. Let's see... about 2% of this movie deals with the ideas in the first two films... there are, maybe 3 scenes with the kung-fu we all know and love, one scene with bullet time and a climax that makes sense I guess, but did the Wachowski brothers really need two other movies to give us this?? I give it one star because there was a little, precious little, substance to this film and because I can't give it zero stars. Don't waste your time, people. Just read reviews with spoilers. Believe me- you won't be missing much at all that you liked in the first two."
2,Oh please...,"The first ""Matrix"" should be the only one. The second two films are severly lacking in all the ways that make ""The Matrix"" great: Pioneering special effects, mind-blowing story, and innovation. This movie rides the coat-tails of the first one with little success.It failed to keep me interested, or awake for that matter. I watched it once on the big screen and once on the small screen, and I recommend seeing this in the movie theater for the special effects.Skip this one and get ""The Matrix"" instead."
1,Highly Dissapointed,"It's really quite simple, The Matrix coulda been the best film trilogy ever, instead the Wachowski Brothers decided to sellout and go the commercial route. Nice and Simple."
3,"Good Final Movie, but needed a little more.","The Matrix Revolutions is a fine final movie, but it needed to have a more human touch and a better ending than it did. Keanu Reeves, Hugo Weaving, and the gang is back but the spectacle is gone, and the ending is must to be desired. Great special effects that do put the first two movies to shame, and the final confrontation between Neo and Agent Smith is a crowd pleasers.It just needed more that it had to be a satisfying ending."
2,This movie stinks,"Horrible movie, not even close to as good as the 1st one was. If you want to see a good trilogy, then go see the Lord Of The Rings."
2,What a stinker.,"I wonder when they realized they didn't have any more plot? This movie totally stunk. It was actually boring, which is hard given all the special effects at their diposal. Damn, what a disappointment. Seriously, if you loved the matrix, don't see it... it will be better this way trust me."
3,Best one out of all of them...untill the last 10 min,"This movie was so good i mean it was awsome it had it all. Battles, love, and intensity. But it seems that the makers couldnt figure out a way it end it all i mean come on people cant you come up with a better ending than that i mean 4 realwait till the video"
2,Dull with potential,This story could be great if the W- brothers condensed it into one or maybe two movies. Two and Three may be condensed maybe not one. The first movie was fresh and innovative. Two and three dragged on and on. The whole concept and the theories were very interesting. I had to force myself to stay awake during the last two movies. The movie moved too slow at the beginning and too much special effects in the second part. What this movie missed was balance and a decent pace. Too bad because the concepts were really interesting and worthy to explore. I had to step out for a couple minutes during the fighting scene for personal reasons and did not to miss anythig...and that says something about how overdone something is. Wait until this comes out in DVD and then skip the long drawn out battle scenes unless this is what you like most about the movie.
1,Worthless,"I was soooo looking forward to seeing this movie! I was. Reloaded wasn't what I had hoped it to be, but it was OK, I guess. I gave it a 6 out of 10 stars (my own personal scale). I was hoping the Brothers would redeem themselves with Revolutions. ""The Matrix: Revolutions"" was absolutly the single WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life! There was NO PLOT, nothing from the first two movies are resolved, no questions are answered. I personally gave it (and I'm a HUGE Matrix I fan mind you.) 1 out of 10 stars. Nothing more I can say about it. I'm going to forget about II and III, should have never of been made. Either of em."
1,"No One Will ""Get It""","From a woman's point of view, to me, a good movie is one that I can go to and have a good time. You shouldn't have to go to a movie and try to figure out what is happening on screen. Many people who go to this movie will not have seen one or both of the prior installments, and because of this, they will not understand a thing while watching this third and final episode. Even I, who saw the other two movies, came away shaking my head. Granted, the fight scenes were excellent, but the movie was terrible overall because it was incomprehensible and the dialogue was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. When you come away from a movie thinking none of it made any sense, that is not a good movie in my book. You shouldn't have to be a Matrix ""afficiando"" to enjoy the movie. I would not pay to see this movie again even though I loved the first Matrix."
3,"Good movie,But not quite the greatest show in the dreamworld","good movie but confusing at some points. Once again, the visual effects are everything in the movie. Well not really but you know what I mean. You may want to watch this at a matenee or rent it on dvd but there are some things to like about the matrix revolutions. Like the sound and the special effects. Like I told you, the movie is quite confusing. I give it a B- and 2.5 out of 4 stars ""**1/2"""
1,The ending KILLED it.,"The movie was great I was loving it.Up to the ending.Warning: SpolierIt just killed the movie when all of a sudden when you least expect it, trinty dies in a crash (the most unlikeley death in the matrix universe) and next thing you know, neo with her.And the sun over the city is NOT how the ending shouldve been.Goodmovie, HORRIBLE EDNING WHICH RUINED THE MOVIE."
2,No Surpise and Big Disappointment,"I was expecting the Revolutions at least better than the Reloaded, however, yes sure, in terms of those CG effected scenes for sure have big improvement, but I guess these scenes are ""supposed"" to be there anyway (in both budget and attractive level)so that it wouldn't give the audience a big supprise!Moreover, about the story, it can be said as very insane~~ Compare to the Reloaded, it's even more complicated the story rather than give answers to all the questions that has been generated.One more disappointment which is that the diagloue in the Revolutions is unexpectedly meaningless, and everything has to be said to explain every action that the character took.......If just pay for the view of those CG effects, it worth the price for the tic!!!!"
2,Blah.,"I loved the first Matrix and greatly enjoyed Reloaded, for its action, but the third installment is pretty bad.Neo and Trinitys love for each was so over drawn and boring. From the get go they had no chemistry and it was like watching two walls get into it. Boring...The annoying little Indian girl. What the hell was that about?And the whole train man, homeless man, scene was retarded. 45 minutes and all it leads to is Trinity putting a gun to his head. Ho hum...And i laugh that the machines made a pact with the humans so that Neo can defeat Smith. That whole 'parley' scene in the machine city was nonsensical.Also, this movie was severely lacking great martial arts scenes, which really made the first two movies enjoyable. The final fight scene was cool but it couldnt save the rest of the terrible excuse of a sequel."
3,Should've rethought revolutions!,"Maybe the first two where so good that expectations where just to high, but Revolutions definetly did not satisfy! Too much action, little depth. Hopefully the Wachowski Bros. will leave it at that and cut our losses. Some good scenes but generally not as good as the first two. See it, but you won't love it!"
3,Edge of Your Seat,"I saw ""Matrix Revolutions"" Saturday (11/1) at the Imax Theater in Chicago. No spoilers will be found here. The negative: wooden characters, some plot holes, very confusing overall (you'll want to see it again to understand), and the first 40 minutes is very slow-moving and talky. Advice: MAKE SURE you watch Matrix II right before seeing this one or you will be confused from the start. The positive: The last half is edge-of-your-seat, astounding entertainment. The action and effects are amazing and everything is resolved. I think most will leave the theater satisfied, though maybe a bit confused."
1,Spoiler** Don't bother...,"I warned you. Don't see this movie - it ruins the whole concept. Instead of being the great liberator, it turns out Neo was nothing but a software upgrade. All the same violence, all the same villain, all for nothing but a sunset. Ugh. What a rip off."
2,Weak,"I liked the first Matrix film because of the music, the action and the special effects. It had a few weaknesses in the storyline and the science of the Matrix was substandard even for a sci-fi movie, but it was a great action movie and that made it fun.The second and third movies had the action that made the first movie great, but they seemed like fanfiction - like those books Kevin J. Anderson wrote based on the Star Wars movies. I simply couldn't buy Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving fighting for control of the world and flying through the air. It seemed kind of stupid.One of the weaknesses in the trilogy is that the strength of the first movie was Neo adjusting to living in the Matrix. When the second movie started, he was suddenly Superman and it took away a lot of what made the character interesting. To make things worse, the brothers focused too heavily on boring and sucky characters."
2,"Argh, worst ending ever.","Just when you thought as bad as it could get was seeing naked pasty white Neo doing the dirty with Trinity while shots of the fat people doing the naked rave party dance scene... ENTER MATRIX 3! It almost fools one into thinking it is not going to be bad... and then boom. The end comes and you are left with the biggest 'wtf' since the end of The Red Planet.Don't buy this movie, pool your cash together with all the others who bought the first two movies and hire someone to give the creators a nuclear wedgie. :P"
1,Horrid film,"This was the worse out of all the Matrix movies. I say this because it was like a rip off of the Star Wars series starting with chapter 4 ""A New Hope"". Same story lines,same hero super powers (holding the hand out and controlling objects) and same dull effects. A lot of blue screen (or chromo effects) in this and they where done very slopply. The bullet time effects was (thank god) at a min. The story line continued to drag along leaving the action to die down. Why was this story line needed to be put into 3 different movies? This movie could have been wrapped up in maybe one or two movies . After a while the action got perdictable. Just a string of hollywood greed and a huge waste of time. Save your money rent it first or watch Star Wars instead !!!!"

1,What were they smoking?,"This was a bad movie. Plain and simple. Reloaded was cool, the first movie rocked but this just plain sucked the big one. There was no decent philosophical points brought up or given in the third. I really don't see how both Reloaded and Revolutions were filmed at the same time because there was no acting, no plot, and no directing. It was a waste of two hours that die hard fans will never get back."
1,Way back in the day,"I remember back in the good ol days when I used to watch The Matrix 100+ times. Of course you know it spawned the dvd revolution. I mean that is really how big this movie was. Everybody had to have a dvd to watch The matrix. The original put the DVD in my house.So to say REVOLUTIONS is a dissapointment is way understating it. Utter dissbelief sounds more like it. I remember walking out of the theatre feeling like I had the wind knocked out of me. I was shocked.Bad movies don't make me feel this way. $9.00 dollars is $9.00, I mean unless that $9.00 is going to save my life. But for some reason that $9.00 felt more like $900.00This is what I'm saying, tell me if you agree. Walking out of a bad movie, I just say such is life.Walking out of Matrix Revolutions I wanted to picket outside the theatre."
1,Would give ZERO stars if only it were possible...,"I find it hard to put my feelings regarding this movie into words. But here's a try: disgusting, revolting, frustrating, completely unfulfilling, and wholly depressing.What could have and should have been an uplifting story of human perseverance and our ability to adapt and overcome great challenges instead ended with heavy-handed religious obligations and hollow compromise.I cannot begin to describe how horrible an atrocity this film was. So much promise, so much disappointment.Even the fabled special effects and fight scenes were puppet-like and predictable, leaving this film without a single redeeming quality."
1,"One of the funniest movies ever...oh, it's not a comedy?","I watch this movie and have to ask if the guys who did it had even seen the first one. Oh, that's right, they wrote and directed it! Getting more and more rediculas by the minute, we soon decide to simply laugh at the absurdity of what we are seeing. When Neo confronts the Oracle about the Architect's prophicy, she tells him to ignore him, the Architect doesn't know what he's talking about. But, but, didn't the Oracle send Neo to find the Architect in Re-Loaded? Wasn't that the climax of Re-Loaded? Well, i guess they need to find some reason to go back into the Matrix. The Oracle then goes on to tell Neo that there are consequences to their descisions...what descisions? he asks, the descisions we make, she replies. What? that dosen't make sence, don't worry about it, it's not supposed to, it's just a movie. ......Anyway, whatch it for a laugh, because it is good for a number of them."
1,keanu....uhhhg,"This movie was absolutly horrible. The first was good, second ok, and the third just plain sucked. This trilogy could have gone up against the greats if they had stuck to the consistancy of the first movie. I think the thing that really killed this series was the awful acting of Reanu Reeves my god can he show any emotions at all. His horrible acting drove me crazy. Every line he had was said in the same monotone voice and i just wanted it all to end. Thanks alot you *#@!er keanu, you ruined everything."
3,good movie but not quite the greatest show in the dreamworld,"The Matrix movie was a hit. The first time anyone used ""bullet time"" special effects.The Matrix Reloaded was a box office hit but not quite good to me. Using the same effects, it has gotten better.The Matrix Revolutions had fans a little disappointed. It was a good movie, but not quite the greatest show in the dreamworld and Zion. Of course, there are special effects. The story/movie is confusing at some points, but there are still things to like about The Matrix Revolutions. This may be good to rent or just borrow from someone else. You could buy it thinking it is inevitable. You can think about it saying the problem is choice. Or not to by saying Why? It's your choice. I give it a B- and 3.5 stars"
3,Not bad but could've been a lot better.,"The final movie in the Matrix movie series is a flawed and often clumsy finish to a great movie trilogy.In the final part of the movie series, Neo realizes that he isn't the ""Almighty Powerful One"" like the ""Reloaded"" installment movie portrayed him as and Agent Smith has become muhc powerful and dangerous to the future of humanity. The machines are digging ever closer to the underground city of Zion, the last remnants of the human population.This movie is fun for it's action and special effects but to me, this only felt like just another extension of the ""Reloaded"" movie which of course is but not to a sense that it was all over and the end result was just nothing but confusion and that there was a lot more to come.This is a fine movie but I felt that it didn't live up to the first two and I can't help but feel rather dissapointed."
4,Th Matrix Revolutions,"This movie was an execelent film. Even though they were only in the Matrix like 2 times. The special effects were still really good. The battle for Zion between the machines and humans ends.The Street fight between Neo and Agent Smith. Though the ending was kind of corny.For those of you who saw it know what I'm talking about. I give this a 4 star rating because of the good special effects and good plot line. I can't wait for it to comes out on DVD April 6, 2004.And for any LOTR fans out there The Lord of the Rings he Return of the King comes out on DVD May 25,2004."
2,"A bridge too far..er, ..one movie too far.","Loved the first movie, seemed the most original thing I had ever seen.Really liked the second one. The third..well I left the theater after it was over and just said to myself. "" What the hell did I just see? "" ..Lord of the Rings it ain't! But I'm compelled to buy it to complete the series. And yeah, at least the battle for Zion was fun..but that's the two stars."
3,The ending,"If you liked the 1st and 2nd parts, then The Matrix Revolutions is a must see follow-up to them both. The ending, however, was a little bit dissapointing. It didn't really explain too much and it just kind of finished when there could have been more. Apart from the lacking storyline, the movie's budget was well spent on a frenzy of digital special effects and a great cast to back it up. The fighting scenes are awesome and almost makes up for what should have been an amazing trilogy. The bottom line is that Revolutions wasn't as impressive as the 1st or even the 2nd movie. I guess we've seen it all before, but the fact remains that it is an ending and no story is complete without one of these! Definitley worth a watch, but don't expect too much."
3,dissappointed after the 1st two Matrix trilogy,Not worth it. I was hugely disappointed esp after the great fx of the 1st 2 of the Matrix trilogy. It seemed that about the only consistent fx was the machines taking over man. This is a tired them and also to continue using the same effect over or to digitally rematch it over and over gets tiring. Of course one interesting multiple effects was the many Mr. Smiths getting created just like a true virus. Unless you're a Matrix collector--I'd just as soon watch a rental or borrow rather than purchase unless for a low price.The 1st 2 Matrix movies I've watched many times...this 3rd of the trilogy has been watched only once--for a reason
5,Great end to the best trilogy ever,"No words can describe my love for these movies. This is the perfect end to the perfect trilogy. The critics may hate it, but they are supposed to, these movies are extremely anti-hollywood. Just watch it and you will see, it is amazing."
4,An end to something we will never see again,"I loved the Matrix trilogy. I think it is a landmark in movie making evolution, and we will never see anything like it again. The last fight between Smith and Neo I'm sure were inspired by Dragonball z, but thats ok because I love Dragonball z. I gave it four stars, because it seemed like by the time they got to the last movie they realized they bit off more than they could chew and just wanted to get it over with, but they wanted to go out with a bang, even if the world thought it would make no sense. But, I love you for the Matrix Wachowski Brothers. I know ya'll are still reaping the benifits from the trilogy, but I for one am interested to see what else is on your mind."
5,Revolutions,great product - the completion of the Matrix trilogy which was an amazing piece of science fiction. can't have the other two movies without this one too !
3,The Matrix Revolutions (Widescreen Edition),"I guess if you're a diehard Matrix fan, Revolutions will be a must have. IMO, Revolutions is just more of the same. I'm not suggesting Revolutions is necessarily bad, but other than an ending, I don't think it adds anything to the story. Then again, an ending is a good thing. I don't understand why this series is rated R tho??"
3,man machine as defence?,the primary defence of zion is in the hands of man operated machines - which are also designed in the shape of man - for a man to sit in and operate them. they have a machine gun fitted to each hand. is this the best that anybody would think of to ward off swarms of attacking sentinels? even traditional machine guns in stone bunkers as used in the two world wars would have been much more effective than these man machines.apart from this the plot is also a bit too convoluted to merit any special mention.matrix 1 was fantastic. reloaded was eye candy par excellence. but revoutions is a let down!
5,The Critics are Dead Wrong About This One,"I'm freshly back from seeing the movie and I am so shocked about all of the negative reviews. I did not see Matrix Reloaded because of the reviews, but rented it last week and realized I had made a big mistake. Matrix Revolutions is an emotional roller coaster that will keep you one the edge of the seat and not to give it all away, but the ending is takes a strange twist and is not some hokey Trinity and Neo living happily ever after crap. The negative critics pretty much had it right for the Phantom Menace, etc., but they are totally out to lunch on this one. I just don't know where they are coming from. It's a blast! It is an incredible movie and all in all the best of the Matrix series. Do your self a favor and see this with the big screen and surrond sound. Love is the answer."
3,Yuen Woo-Ping where were you???,"Man, after the Matrix Reloaded I thought that this movie was going to have a hard time topping it, becuase of all the great fight sequences. Yuen Woo Ping was the fight choreographer for the first two films and Reloaded was AWESOME! But Mr. Yuen could have taken this one off, there was only 1 fight scene and that was at the end and it kind of sucked because they just flew around. You throw in a complicated and confusing story and you come up with: DISAPOINTMENT. I'm sorry, but I sure expected more from this movie. I knew it would have been impossible to top Reloaded, but they could have at least tried. This movie manages three stars based solely on the first two movies. This movie on its merits only deserves one maybe two."
5,Why can't people like it?,"What's the problem folks? Why is this one so hard for people to swallow? It was an incredible film. And who keeps saying there wasn't enough action? Were they in the bathroom the whole time the machines were attacking Zion? Series not resolved? Of course it was. Neither The Matrix or the machines were destroyed, this is true. However, the series was about Neo, and Neo's story was resolved. And what was there to not get? I keep hearing from people who were confused during this movie. How? I don't understand that. Reloaded had so much more senseless babble that went on and on. Remember the scene with the Architect in Reloaded? Now that was a lot of long-winded crap. Or Neo's conversation with the Oracle in the park, now that had some truly bad dialogue. Revolutions is so much more advanced than Reloaded. I don't know. It makes me sad that so many are depriving themselves of an amazing movie, but that's alright, I loved it and strongly urge others to see it for themselves."
2,Even those who are not hard core fans will note a glitch...,"I'm a hardcore fan. Period. When I woke up this morning to see the end of the trilogy that has changed the cinema as we know it, I did not expect to become disapointed.This installment does nothing but dodge around the meaning of the sequels. I thought that they were there to show how humans would put an end to the machine world and become the dominant beings. Yet instead you leave the theater with an empty feeling. Very empty as the film takes the lives of those who matter the most in the fight for freedom.Freedom will not be found if that is what you are looking for. Instead this franchinse takes nothing from the viewer but their money, perhaps setting up another few Matrix films....I'm still in awe. What went wrong?!!!"
1,Worst. Sci-Fi. Ever.,"What the hell happened to the plot? At the end of the 2nd movie, we're left with interesting clues to how the Matrix came about, and it's clear that there is more to be revealed. And what happens? They ignore all of that in favor of an action movie that has no action and no suspense? Why add on lame characters in an attempt to tug on our heartstrings? After all of the interest and mystery of the Merovingian, Persephone, Agent Smith, Seraph, the Oracle, and the Keymaker in the 2nd movie, why abandon all of that for the last movie? This could have been an interesting movie where they tie together the clues in the 1st and 2nd movie and paint a cohesive picture of the world of the matrix and how it came about. Instead they left all of that behind. This was a waste of money. Totally unforgivable moviemaking."
1,horrible.............,"This movie sucked. I've been a huge fan of the Matrix series up to this point, but how could anyone screw this movie up so badly? Why didn't anyone working on it speak up and say ""this is really going to suck""? 90% of the movie was incredible, but the ending seems like they just gave up on thinking. I only pray that they were just kidding with this one, and they are going to release the real ending in a couple of weeks."
2,Matrix should have stopped at number 2,"I am a Matrix fan. I saw the first one three times in the theater and countless times on DVD. The second Matrix delivered almost as much with the ""New Smith"" reproducing countlessly-- balancing Neo's new superpowers. The third in the series is a disappointment. It departs from the person to person combat that typified the first and to some extent the second. Instead we are treated to more cryptic dialogue, religious symbology to the point of storyline distortion and overblown special effects that become much less satisfying--just as they become the most intense.The final battle between Neo and Smith was a letdown. The repeated use of water exploding when they clash was just too much. I expecting something cleverer from the Wachowski brothers.If you want to see this just to tie up the loose ends in Matrix Reloaded, rent it. If you want almost mindless action, eye candy watch the second half"
5,Can't Wait For This One....,"I am highly anticipating this movie. If you really liked the first Matrix, then I think you could enjoy this one. I LOVE all three of the Matrix's. This one has a fantastic ending and is very unpredictable. Such a shame that the Matrix story has to end here."
3,NOT as good as the first one,"Reloaded wasn't as good as the first one, some sexual scences destroyed the true image of Matrix and changed it to just some sort of high special effected interesting movie wich you can't watch it more than 2 or max. 3 times. (I'had seen the Matrix more than 15 times).Watch it and enjoy, if you want to buy the dvd do it but remember that the next year there will be a matrix boxed set."
1,The Darkside of the Matrix,The Matrix series should be looked at as an example of what George Lucas had better not do (OR ELSE!) with the final Star Wars movie. I will personally FedEx him my movie ticket and popcorn receipt for him to give me back my money via PAYPAL!
1,What a Waste!,"I was a huge fan of the first movie. The second came along and although I wasn't thrilled with it, I found it watchable. This final episode in the triligy was too awful to describe.....Boring, trite, utterly uncreative, it was a total waste. Pass on this one. You won't be missing anything."
3,"Great graphics, crapppy ending","OK, the action is awesome, fight scene with Neo and Smith is a little short, but the story line gets screwed up! You have no clue whats going on and you don't know how it ended! It also has the worst last scene ever. But it has a GREAT soundtrack. If you want to watch it and skip the last 10 minutes"
3,"The Only ""Average"" Matrix Movie","First off, don't put this DVD in expecting The Matrix, or anything equal to ""Reloaded."" It is a little bland compared with it's prequels. It is much more violent, sad, and dark.The fight scene at the end is pretty neat, but it really failed to pack in the physcilogical blast the first two had in great measure.See it, but don't expect the first two. Maybe you should rent it edited, it had some content problems as well."
5,The Greatest Trilogy Ever,"This will be the most wanted dvd this year, after the reloaded comes the revolution, this dvd will include incredible footage and special features like:* Future Gamer The Matrix Online - An introduction to the massive multi-player game The Matrix Online, created by the Wachowski Brothers.* 3-D Evolution- Transition to different levels of the Matrix to view concept art, storyboards, pre-visualizations and realizations for several elements in Revolutions.* Before the Revolution - 3-D timeline of the concurrent story development occurring in the Matrix between the Matrix trilogy, The Animatrix, and Enter the Matrix.Will be a 2 disc edition, so there will be more hours of matrix.(This is my first amazon review, so sorry for my bad english)"
3,Alien 3 anyone?,"You know the way I felt after I saw this movie is exactly the same as when I saw Alien 3, very disappointed. The whole thing felt rushed and seemed more of an after thought. But I am surprised about the similarities between the two franchises (Alien and The Matrix) as far as how the directors treated their material. Like the first movies was about mystery and lots of questions the second was about action and surviving and the last one was a disaster! I can expect that the next Matrix movie would be all about redeeming the mistakes made in the last movie like alien 4 did. But should you see it? I think yes just to finish the whole thing. Maybe time will improve the movie especially when watch back-to-back with reloaded but who knows? As far as I'm concerned I'll still love the first two just like in the Alien series and I'll just leave it at that."
2,Matrix Revolutions - Good but not satisfying,"Just back from seeing 'The Matrix - Revolutions"".Yes, it looks great and it sounds great, but ultimately I was just left with an empty feeling. which was disappointing. After nearly 6-7 hours of screen time I was hoping that the third installment would bring the storyline to an acceptable conclusion. As it ends now I expect we'll se Matrix 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9 over the coming years. (Depends how much MONEY this one earns).I noticed a few people saying you had to understand the final film to like it. Could one of these people explain the final film in less than 50 words?"
2,At least it wasn't cliche',"Matrix Revolutions was interesting as sort of a post-modernistic blend of Christianity and Jungian psychology, but in the end it was a let down as an action adventure movie, and it's message was rather garbled.The main positive for me was that they didn't resort of one of those ubiquitous finales where some sort of clock is ticking down to disaster, with the world saved with 2 seconds to spare.But the ending was not very satisfying. Nothing was resolved in any way that seemed permanent. The main characters were abandoned and minor characters pushed to the front of the stage. What philosophical points it made were confused by the need to show something exploding, speeding, or performing Kung Fu every few minutes."
4,every beginning has an end,"you know what? i really liked it. others may disagree and find it disappointing, but i found it incredibly entertaining. there are moments in this movie that are truly inspiring and breathtaking. i found myself really caring about these characters. i went through anger, sadness, hope, and happiness while watching this movie. matrix was awesome, reloaded was just plain bad, and revolutions is beautiful. i think the reason why people dont like it is because they're not looking for beautiful in the matrix. but the amount of courage and bravery displayed is very touching. i was moved...""we'll give them hell!"" and ""as long as he has a single breath in his body, he will never give up"". ""why do you go on when you know you're going to lose?"" mr. smith asks neo. this is a story of triumph over loss, of hope through overwhelming odds."
2,So disappointing,"The action and effects were great, but the Matrix presumes to be something deeper. It turns out that it's just confusing mush.There's a lot of talk about choice and purpose and love--and if this trilogy is to mean something it ought to say something. And you think it's going to. But it doesn't. Smith asks Neo why he gets up, why he continues to fight. Neo just says, ""Because I choose to."" Ridiculous. Is that all the Wachowskis want to say? After all the interaction of choice, destiny and love, Neo ends up a pure existentialist? Again, I say, ridiculous.And to top it off, Neo's ""choice"" results in peace with the machines. Peace! Are you kidding? After the wonderfully rich set up of the machines as symbolic of the way our own pride, ambition and hubris can blind and enslave us, the result is peace with the enslaver? Huh?They should have stopped with just the first one. They got completely lost with the next two."
2,The death knell of the Matrix series,"I'm sorry--was there a movie here?I saw a lot of special effects. I saw a helluva lot of special effects. But I'm not sure if I ever saw an actual movie.Wow. Yikes.Stick a fork in this once vaunted series.This lamentable 3rd installment of the Matrix does to this series what the horrible 2nd installment of Robocop (Peter Weller) did to that series, and what the horrible 3rd installment of Aliens (Sigourney Weaver) did to that series: Kills it off completely, finally."
1,"crap, crap, crap!!!!!!","As a fan of the Matrix franchise, I was anxiously awaiting this third installment, but was sorely disappointed. I even defended ""Reloaded"" to my friends who were hell-bent on trashing the franchise based on the second chapter.What can you say about this festering pile of ... other than it is a movie that can only be tolerated by the few people who ""get"" the Wachowski's rambling and too-often ridicous theo-philosophy. the only redeeming moment of the film is when Trinity FINALLY dies after her monologue which seems to take as long as the entire Rings trilogy.The fights were unfulfilling, the usually great supporting characters are pathetic, and the graphics brought nothing new to the discussion. No wonder the Academy totally ignored every aspect of this movie, as it was unworty of any such consideration.I hope that Neo really is dead so nobody tries to revive the franchise and squeeze another $10 out of me."
4,Good for Matrix fans,"I would have to say that I wished Revolutions had as much or more of the awesome 'in the Matrix' action of the first two movies, but I gotta say that you can't judge these movies individually, you have to look at them as one. The first one was obviously the more mind-blowing since it was so new, the second was filler, and the third would be the end of the story AS TOLD by the Wachowski brothers. If you're not a Matrix fan, then just relax and go back to X-Men or something. These movies, and the video game, require you to think about the whole story. I'm going to buy Revolutions when it comes out to complete my set. I know that sounds tright, but hey, works of art like this don't come along very often..."
5,Beautiful Philosophy,"The Matrix series is based off of several philosophical and mystical sources: gnosticism, Nietzche and Buddhism. This movie, is faster, and more action packed, but still covers philosophical questions concerning reality. Philosophy 101 in blockbuster format."
4,"Great Movie, Maybe More to come?","Some people I just don't understand. Yes the 1st Matrix Film was good, but the sequels had alot more of a plot to them. So many people loved the first film and thought it was the best movie they ever saw. But then everyone critizes the sequels and literally turn agianst what they once thought was fantastic. I for one enjoyed the entire Trilogy. The ending to Revoultions was disapointing, I'll admit that. But, I feel that maybe, just maybe in a few years down the road there may be more to this story then we all think. The Matrix is the best Sci-Fi Trilogy I have ever witnessed. As the Program 'Smith' once said, ""It's not over."""
4,Great Movie,"The Matrix Revolutions has some of the best action. It is so much better than Reloaded, and about equal to the first Matrix. The scenes with Niobe flying the ship is hot, and the battle between the Machines and Humans is great. The final battle is awesome too, as well as trinity,morpheus, and Seraph in the club. You have to go see this movie, but you need to see the first 2 before watching this one."
4,is it really over?...,I thought that the movie was great and i would give 4 stars out of 5. the thing that stroke me the most about revolutions was that how the special effects designers had advanced the special effects into another level. The fight between Neo and Smith was fantastic and i have never ever in my life seen such detail graphic designs in that seen. The ending was not what i had expected it did not make me belive that the triology its over i still think that there is something missing in that film i was not satisfied with the ending and so were some of my friends. It could had finished with something more symbolic and a knowing the future of Zion and the human civilisation. Happy with the special effects but not happy with the ending of the film.
2,AWFUL ...... and I loved the first two.,"I cannot begin to tell you of my disappointment. This film lacked the substance that the first two had. The dialogue was horrible (bad enough to remind me of Star Wars) and the acting was even worse ......... if that's possible. The only positive I found was the special effects, which were again quite incredible. But you cannot make a movie on special effects alone (again see the new Star Wars films) and expect it to be great.And finally, the ending was a huge disappointment. The first two films left me wanting more, while this one simply made me want it to end."
2,YAWN!,"I Really never saw whats so great about these movies!! And I think this and reloaded proved this to many people. Since i had seen the first two i decided i had to round out the triligoy. So i watched it the other day at a friends house who got an early copy. It wasn't a terrible movie, but It was far from good. The end of the series couldn't have been worse! I'm not going to say anything for those of you who haven't seen it. But i'm a firm believer that not many people see these movies for the plot. The special effects are quite impressive, but all in all the movie lacks massivly in the dialouge and acting department. The first Matrix was a fine movie, its wasn't great like every one says it was but like, the sequals were almost embarsing! I gave this movie 2 stars because i couldn't give it one and a half. The large scale battle sequence was the only redeming factor to this yawn fest."
1,this wasn't a movie,"By far the worst out of the trilogy. The first one was a classic, the second was pushing it, and the third, well it was just horrible. Complements to the CGI guys, but if there was ever a movie that proved that special effects don't make a movie, this is it.We spend the first movie really caring about the main characters, Neo's journey, Morpheous' faith, Smith's joyous evil...then for the grand finale, we're forced into a position where we no longer know who these people are, and could care less what happens to them. It felt like Neo/Reves had a handful of lines, and poor Morpheous--once the grand character in Matrix I, is relegated to a a couple scenes and a few lines.This isn't a movie, it's a show piece for your HDTV set. Regardless, I have successfully convinced myself that Reloaded and Revolutions never existed, there was never a Matrix trilogy. Just the first one."
2,Why do you persist? We ask the same thing!!!,"I really loved the Matrix. Smart, movie that caught you off guard. But Matrix Reloaded should have been labelled Matrix Re-bloated. It was silly, pretentious and basically laughable in spots. Neo goes Superman. Blah! And yes, I really gave it several chances to see if it would improve.So I held off with this final installment - 2 installments too any. Bigger is not better, it's just more of the same overblown mess than Reloaded was. Trinity's death scene was bland, failing to move me. It was so much special effects, and some quite funny.Wave bye bye Neo...thankfully!! This movie series will go down in the history of film as how NOT to make a sequel and a sequel's sequel."
2,disappointing,The fan boys would have you believe that this movie was good... and if you think it wasn't then you are stupid and just didn't understand it.I understood it. It was a serious disappointment. The first movie was so good compared to the second and third movies.Rent it - once is enough...
1,Sucks,"Ok, this movie sucked for a number of reasons. Hello, where is the plot? Didn't you forget something, like a story that made sense? So what happens in the end? Peace? Peace of what? It clearly showed all the little human embryos still in their little embryos. Maybe the ones in Zion just get left alone below the earth mid their rubble...that is a happy ending alright... And who is that little Indian girl? How sweet that she makes sunrises and sunsets I suppose, but who cares? What happened to her parents? Are they still locked in? And what about Frenchy? Is Neo dead or alive?And what was the point in killing Trinity?Only good actor was Smith who is always good no matter what crap he is doing~Did Neo even have a story line? I can't remember it, except he didn't get to eat any cookies...Too weird... See Brother Bear instead."
3,"What's next? A good movie, it doesn't end the story.","Sure the humans make peace with the machines, but there is still a Matrix, there's still a Zion, there is still a machine city, and their are still endless fields of human slaves, and the whole world is still covered by black clouds. There is a new Matrix online video game where thousands of online gamers will interact to shape the new world, But I would rather have a movie that gives an ending, or at least another movie that begain to shape a new world before this new online game, then it wouldn't have to start from complete kayoss."
2,Koxson,"This movie is called Matrix. Something the characters were not in as much as they should have been if viewers were to feel traped. The atmosphere went sour in some parts of the movie and yes. The ending was rubbish.I admit. I did expect more from the matrix. It were Superman and Doomsday in the ""Super Brawl"" I would have been astonished. But, alas, I was not. I wish I had a movie eraser I could rub out revolutions and the sex scene in reloaded while I was at it.Don't get me wrong for a hollywood movie this gets a 8/10 or 9/10. But for The Matrix... all it gets from me is a 3/10 to 4/10 and a dissapointed viewer.Lloyd Harris."
1,Awful Sequel,"The original Matrix (1999) is superb! Had this sequel been released first, I don't think any others in this series would have been made. This sequel was boring, disjointed and lackluster. What a waste of talent, money and (often boring) special effects. Save your money, just rent it if you haven't already seen it. An interesting observation is that the Matrix series is inversely related to the Lord of the Rings series, specifically, The Lord of the Rings gets much better with each sequel while the Matrix degenerated to an abyss of muddled storyline and rehashed special effects. Something to do with karma balancing out? Beats me. Just an observation I made, that's all."
4,The continuation of an epic sci-fi saga,"""The Matrix Revolutions"" continues the story begun in the original ""Matrix"" film. Once again Keanu Reeves plays cybermessiah Neo, who fights to defend humanity against an enslaving machine collective.""Revolutions"" effectively expands upon the compelling mythology established in the original film, as the freedom fighters continue to move between the gritty real world and a complex virtual reality construct. Much of the film is a relentless orgy of violence and explosions--at times it's just too much and becomes exhausting. Nevertheless, there are a number of genuinely thrilling and inventive action/fight scenes. There are also some memorable visual images.At its worst ""Revolutions"" can be bombastic, obscure, pretentious, and even corny. The film is at its best when it remains in touch with the essential humanity of its characters. Reeves anchors the eclectic, multiethnic ensemble cast with his earnest, understated performance."
2,The revolution did not happen,"I felt that this was the weakest film of the series because it concentrated too much on characters that I did not really want to identify with. I think it did not spend enough time on the principle characters and Morpheus does very little in this film. Although the ending is not bad, the Zion attack scene was not what I really wanted to see and the dialogue is pretty corny at times. I think this is a flawed movie and not a very good addition to the Matrix series. Reloaded was better but the original is still the best."
5,totally amazing,"Way better than the Matrix Reloaded. This was the most exciting and dazling movie I have ever seen. It's almost like your brain is not quite able to take in all of the excitement and the visual imagery, which far surpasses anything ever shown.It's not perfect, but what is? Go for the pure enjoyment of giving your overloaded brain a rest. It doesn't have to make sense, and those who try and over analyze it will be poorer for their effort. You don't need to analyze why chocolate tastes good. It just does.Enjoy!!"
1,Most of the movie,Most of the movie was very good. I took four stars off just because of the way it ended. It left to many open holes which where supposed to be awnsered and just plain sucked.The first movie was worth 5 stars the second 4/4.5 this one is a 1.5.
1,what a dissapointment,what a waste this was the first matrix was awsome the second one was a tad weird and had me wondering a few things but i figured 3 would fix that so i held on. the 3rd one all i can say that was good about it was teh apu's the humans use were cool i like mech stuff but still every thing on this one seemed rushed like the producers and studio were like hey guys come on u spent to much time messin a round get it out now . what a waste shame on the dir for messin up a great story and goin with a basic hollywood ending .
1,And some say second was bad?,"The worst movie of all trilogy. The second was bad and I thought this one can`t get any worse, I was SO wrong. The two hourse of completely lame action. Action is bad also and borring. Don`t waste your money on this ""movie"" just watch the second part once more"
1,Garbage,Hardly entertaining except maybe that you laugh at the ridiculousness. I can't believe that the film was even produced. Didn't anyone read the script and realize what crap it is?
1,"Bad, Very, Very Bad!","A series for uncritical 13 year olds of all ages.The entire point of this dubious business seems to be cram every tired old B movie plot device into one story and power it up with a special effects budget that rivals the gross national product of some of the smaller European countries. Devotees rage at such criticism by citing the cool stunts, spiffy costumes and endless explosions that go on ad naseum. But we've seen this ALL before and done better elsewhere. The plot is just not there!And from reading about how this series came about I can see that the Wachowski boys spared no effort in using every hook and device they could think of to create a piece of merchandise that would return a maximum yield on the studio's investment.The studio isn't touting them as great film makers because they make great films but because the Wachowski's have found a way of stealing money from children that's safe and legal."
3,it works,"For being in ""excellent"" condition the case was all scuffed up as well as the case and the DVD itself was covered in rental stickers. The center of the DVD also has a small crack in it. The DVD does work and has no play glitches"
4,Close.....,"So close guys, I will give you a few things to look forward to. If you do not want to know, stop reading....Trinity sadly dies in this one, which turns out to be a really well shot scene, Neo and Smith find out that they are 1/2 of each other and Neo must let Smith take him over (as you have already seen him do to others in part 2) and so Neo sacrafices himself for the Matrix (since he is now apart of Smith he blows him and all of his clones up.) I probably didn't explain this that well, but when you see the movie you will understand. There is a ton more that I am leaving out so go see the movie."
1,From bad to...................dead,"In May of last year, I was very excited to see Matrix Reloaded. It turned out to only have two cool scenes in it.Then at the end of the movie a preview of REVOULTION was shown. I figured they were saving the best for last.Boy..was I ever wrong. This movie died by the first 5 minutes. Then it got worse,how can you ever get worse from death? But of course, it had to end somehow, someway. Matrix pulled it off in many ways, but for the worse. I believe this film shoveled itself into the grave. I give it the one star due to the fact that this would very well be the end of this dumb-drowned series. I put it as if I saw a bad joke that was told to by a person with no scence of humor...."
4,The last Matrix???,"Well all you matrix fans you will be a little dissapointed with the thrid in the trillogy. I enjoyed this film unti the last 10 min. What did they run out of money and said we meed to wrap this up? The skittles ending I cound do without. You decide, the first was out of this world, the second was good, and the 3rd should have just been in the second and have it be a long movie. Still worth the purchase and to watch....Trinity and Neo live!"
1,NO PLACE LIKE EARTH?,"ARE these outtakes from the frist two? # 1 was Great, innovative, # 2 much better and lots of fun?# 3 - somewhere between Trainstations and Coalminers .... complete with Sigourney Weaver's robo-forklift from ALIENS?ORACLE? Wasn't she in Stephen King's THE STAND? OR is this the unknown Jean Paul Satre's ""No Exit""- revisited?It's all very so-so, and probably most appealing for the 15 to 30 year-olds - and made for their minds ..... but really ... so much droning, so much confusion ....AND what's with the green glows? Close to OZ I woulc say."
5,Be Good Matrix Fans,"For the people, The only way you can realy like the matrix is if your a true fan.Not just a fan of the movie but a fan of the movie stars and of all the hard work that was put into it. Sure some of the 1star raters might be a true fan but there wrong on what they say.Since The Matrix Revolution leaves off at the point that The Matrix Reloaded ended then its realy just 1 long movie so if you hate evolution you hate Reloaded. Since Reloaded is set up by the events in the first film then you would hate that to.Personaly I loved the Matrix 1,2, and 3, I even like The Animatrix, mainly because im a true fan. The fight between Agent Smith was realy good. So if you hate The Matrix Revolutions then you hate it all."
2,Ugh...this movie...,"I bought this movie so I would have the complete set. Apparently, my OCD was greater than my desire to keep my money. Of course, I still bought the blu ray set when I came out. Though, at least I could say I did for the few good parts of this franchise and for how great it looked on blu ray. Looking back on it, I have no good excuse for this movie."
1,matrix trilogy fizzles out,"very disapointing. after an amazing buildup with the first two movies revolutions just leaves you flat. no wonderful plot twists, no answers, and an ending that feels like it was made up at the last seccond and slaped onto the end of an otherwise amazing trilogy. The movie itself was not horrible, the action and final battle was amazing, but you, whoever you happen to be reading this, could have come up with a better way to end this trilogy. unfortunately, and very unlike parts 1 and 2, revolutions will not blow your mind."
3,Predictable as it can get.,"After watching the first Matrix, i thought to myself, wow what an amazing movie, its one that makes you think all the while displaying non-stop action. Then The Matrix Reloaded came out (my personal favorite of all of them) and it was even better, more action, more noise, it was much more familiar than the first. Then we get to the sub-par 3rd installment. The Matrix Revolutions is by no means a crappy movie, tons of non-stop action and it fills in the holes from the previous 2 rightfrom the get-go. The only problem is that I was expecting the unexpected, in other words, anyone could tell what was going to happen, and that is what this movie lacked, mystery. It was more of an out there deal, you know whats going to happen. Bottom line is that if you liked the first two of course its a must see, even by anymeans its a must see."
3,It was decent,"When I first saw this on an IMAX screen, it was intense - I had to look away several times to avoid being overwhelmed by the images. And I can't say as how I enjoyed it - I loved how the first movie dealt with the transformation of the reality of the matrix and how the second one told more about how the matrix came to be (except that whole dancing/sex scene - that was just weird). The third one I had higher hopes for. I thought maybe that the movie makers would explain why the machines allowed zion to exist. I thought there was a chance that it would turn out with zion being a second matrix on top of the first and so no one was ever really free from the machines. Now that would have been mindblowing if they had done it right.All in all, if you ignore the first and second movies and put this movie on its own, it's pretty good (though it doesn't have too much character development) and it's a very good hollywood action movie. Put with the first two movies and it doesn't quite measure up."
3,"Better than Reloaded, but still does't match the original.","The Wachowski brothers really tried to make this an epic trilogy similar to the likes of ""Lord of The Rings"" and ""Star Wars,"" but really they should have stuck with one revolutonary film rather than attempt three and fail miserably. Reloaded was a pointless mess of a film, however still entertaining. Reloaded was a buildup to the war that in Revolutions. The third film is a revolution, however. It is a revolution in overused special effects and dry acting by all but the minor characters, such as Hugo Weaving, Mary Alice, and a short but great appearance by Bruce Spence. The plot relies on you watching Reloaded, but it doesn't really rely too much on understanding it. Revolutions is just a war movie with a lot of excessive special effects, kind of like ""Lord of The Rings,"" but LOTR had a plot where the effects didn't get in the way. If we had just stuck with the orignal, everything would have been fine."
4,"Not great, but a lot better than Reloaded","Revolutions is a vast improvement on Reloaded. Sure, its not as good as the original, and the dialogue didn't tax the scriptwriters, BUT the special effects are fantastic, the fight scenes are tremendous, and it makes a pretty damn good attempt on making sense out the muddle left by Reloaded.I think a lot of people writing negative comments about this film are expecting some mind-blowing, life-changing relevation when they go to see it. Don't. Just enjoy - its a film!"
2,it felt like a movie from a different series,"it felt like a movie from a different series, there were too many inconsistencies to forgive, and sheesh did the ending particularly reek, but overall it was closure of sorts. certainly not worth the $...i paid.success clearly went to the wachowskis' heads, and enough depth wasn't there to justify the added attention. it is hard to blame the actors in this case. it's obvious everyone wanted to recreate the impact they had had with matrix 1, yet it just didn't happen (matrix2 & 3 do not even rank).nevertheless, it would be wrong to trivialize the success/impact matrix 1 had - that movie will be a good watcher for a long long time."
2,Graphically Rich Painfully Boring Dramatic Mess,"Epic in scale with a major thumbs up for the visual effects. But in the final analysis - eye candy cannot overcome the awful plot and characters. The original Matrix film was kick butt comic book stuff that the Wachowski Bros nailed cold and amazingly pegged the paradox of our anxiety about technology versus our desire to control it and enhance ourselves.This film and RELOADED both offered plenty of ""Matrix"" continuity for the scifi squirrels - but REVOLUTIONS; more than its predecessors, quickly sours dramatically and becomes boring, looking like a bad music video by the end with 'Battlestar Galatica' type plot elements. Combine that with the philosophical, allegorical pretensions and it simply implodes into an embarrassing mess. Completionists will buy the movie for their collections but others should steer clear."
1,Total Space Garbage!!!!!!!!,"The first Matrix movie should have been the only one to be made. Reloaded was were it started to turn into total and utter space trash. And I can only sum up Revolutions in two words "" hot garbage "" !!!!!!! I was looking for the total annihilation of the machine world and the end of the Matrix as well. Instead I got a ending that just wreaks of a fourth Matrix. The main character's acting didn't make this film any better either!!! I am so happy I went to see this trash at the matinee price. If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. Seeing as its not deserving of even a star!!!"
2,Revolutions Disappointing,"I expected so much from the build up of the first two movies, that Revolutions really let me down. Neo had a score to settle with the Frenchman and the Architect that was completely abandoned. Neo's fate was left completely ambiguous. Morpheous was reduced to being a navigator and Trinity's character deserved better. Fans were really let down."
1,i never felt so ripped off,"what a terrible movie,You have got to see Matrix Revolution. After which, you will have a better understanding and appreciation for money, time, and especially choice. If you are a pessimist, after the movie, you will worry about self-worth, if you are an optimist, you will become a pessimist. Ask yourself, could it be worse?p.s. don't listen to what people are saying, all you have to do is believe."
2,not what you would expect,"I was looking forward to go see the Matrix Revolution, but it was very dissapointing, nothing like the first two. The whole movie is about fighting the machines, and they hardly ever go into the Matrix. There are no realy intense fight scenes. My advice is to never go see this movie, it is not worth it, a waste of money. I will never go and see this movie again, I wont even watch it when it comes out on cable. Life is to short, do not waste your time."
1,This Film Never Should Have Been Made.,"Neo hangs out, not doing much while a bunch of lameasses talk and mess around and wait for Neo to save them yet again, then he dies. The end. Atrocious storyline, boring scenes, bad acting, uninspired garbage, as if written by a matrix-hater to ruin the original.It's no longer ""What is the Matrix?"" It's, ""Where is the Matrix?"" That's what everyone would like to know."
1,Matrix Inverted,"Formula for an excellent sci-fi movie: first the story, second the story, and third the effects. Effects are the spice, not the main course. Avoid the movie. Instead, eat a box of curry powder and you'll have experienced Matrix Rev."
2,Where Was The Revolution???,"Let us review the word ""revolution"" from the dictionary. The definition alone will trenchantly critique Matrix Revolutions.revolution -2 a : a sudden, radical, or complete change b : a fundamental change in political organization; especially : the overthrow or renunciation of one government or ruler and the substitution of another by the governed c : activity or movement designed to effect fundamental changes in the socioeconomic situation d : a fundamental change in the way of thinking about or visualizing something : a change of paradigm e : a changeover in use or preference especially in technology.So, where was the revolution???"
1,Just WHERE did I put the RAINBOW?,"NO, this one just does not work! The 1st - Great!, the 2nd ~ Eye-opening and super? This final installment? Just how much ZEN can an audience take?Now, this is just fine for the young boy between - shall we say 15 and 35 ...... with nothing else to do but contemplate the 'Meaning of Life', but this versionis somewhere between a Train Station and a lonely group of bored coalminers ..... even the human machines [the Robo-soldiers seem to have been lifted from Sigourney Weaver's ALIENS].As for all this TALK TALK and MORE TALK with ORACLE- CAN ANYONE SAY ""THE STAND""?Almost a mod version of Jean Paul Satre's ""NO EXIT""- which basically it is- without the brilliance --- just a great deal of monotone droning here .... and just what is with the shades of Green ..... homage to OZ?As a matter of fact.... doesn't the ending remind one .......""There's No Place Like Earth""."
2,should see this movie... but its pretty sucky,"The Matrix trilogy isn't an awful movie... but by no means is it a great one. This movie is filled with interesting fight scenes and characters you can love, and love to hate but (which im sure im not going to be the last to say this) the acting is very poor. I found myself zoning out until the next fight scene. and even then, though the graphics were good, you could tell exactly when the cut scenes and where the graphics took over, it lacked a smooth transition. Its a trilogy that needs to be watched, but it shouldnt be highly rated."
1,He should have never taken that red pill,"The third matrix. Genious. These guys are so brilliant they dont have to make good movies or even sense. The train man. The maorlvigian. Brillaint. It was so good i went home and took all the red pills i could find in my house. I went on crazy, puked on my mom then tumbled down a well and went on a journey where i thought i knew kung fu and thought i was making a good movie. Sadly both were wrong."
1,The revolution should not be televised...,"This movie never really had a chance. The writing is absolutely terrible. The movie plods along with a cornucopia of insipid philosophical mumbo jumbo... all uttered with a straight face as if any of it made sense. Neo and Trinity are barely in the movie. The Matrix itself is surprisingly absent from this installment. Basically it's not so much that it stinks... The problem is that it is boring and lame. There were some pretty big logic problems too... For example, that one girl gets stabbed once in the stomach by that guy possessed by Agent Smith and she dies immediately. Somehow, however, Trinity can have multiple wounds going all the way through her body and still have time for another boring pointless discussion with Neo. I just finished watching it and I am already nearly done forgetting it. Did they really flush $100 million down the toilet on this turkey? Hard to believe but they actually had the nerve to plant the seed for another sequel. Good luck!"
1,Good... OK... Just Plain Bad,"OK, I normally don't like Keanu Reaves at all! But, I gotta admit I liked the first Matrix movie! Nice concept, well done, etc...Unlike the LOTR films, the Matrix just got worse as it went along. Talk about believing your own hype! And ""Revolutions"" was THE worst.OK, if you saw the first 2 you'll probably see this one too, but I pity you."
4,Matrix Revolutions,The graphics and action sequences were awsome however the screen play was lacking.The ending was weak.
2,OK,"Throughout this whole movie, the only thing i was thinking, was, oh my god, this is the best movie ever. But the ending just BLOWS! I was so disapointed. I mean really, did the other writers and editors even care? Yes, i do say that you should see the movie, but leave ten minutes early."
5,the anomaly is fixed,i believe that causality is the underlying theme of these movies. I believe that by killing neo he unlocked the powers of the one and by neo killing smith he unlocked smiths true powers. The two become equal forces killing each other in an epic battle. The two anamolies are killed and the next matrix can be created.
1,Matrix Revolutions: The Greatest Story Over-told,"It is very hard to write a review of this movie withoout spoilers, because the ending is SO bad, SO hackneyed and SO familiar thats it reduces the entrie series to a mundanity and a waste of 6 hours of our lives. Suffice it to say that this story ends up as exactly the same story almost all of you have heard many times before.Save your money, Go to church and hear the same story for free!"
2,Better than Reloaded but still bad,"Forget about substance and meaning. It's all about the fetish clothing and wu xia kung fu choreography. There are a few moments with symbolic meaning and a bit of eye candy, but overall it's very bland. They should have cut Reloaded and Revolutions down to one movie, given Monica more screen time, and shown more of the night club patrons. Two stars for being an improvement over the sequel, and for the night club scene."
2,Only one thing,"Nothing to say about Matrix 2 & 3, but just the pleasure to see again (and for the last time, as she decided) the beautiful and enigmatic Canadian actress Carrie Ann Moss, and feel very sorry about her death, however I think she preferred to die before keep running in this nonsense techno-digital-effects race.The sequence I enjoyed the most, because the implicit humor and human feelings: Monica Belluci and Carrie fighting about kissing Keanu Reeves. What a lucky man.From the legitimate questions about human future of the first film, a few are left in the second, and none in the third."
4,Very well done,"That it didn't appeal to the minority of ""Ahnold-shoot-em-up-blow-wm-up"" fans is no real loss.It's a good movie that sort of ""wraps up"" without ""ending"" the story.Don't look for all the heroes to ride off into the sunset, and don't look for geeky, campy one-liners. This is actually the more cerebral of the movies to date.Bueno."
2,disappointing,"While I recognize it is difficult to keep the momentum up after the amazing first film, this movie felt slow, full of cliche and some of the dialogue was downright ridiculous. I'm probably the first to pull out a tissue during a good drama, but nothing in this movie moved me. I consider it a bad sign that after following these characters through three films I felt no attachment to them. Despite some great special effects and a few pseudo-horror winces, I have to say I expected better. It's not as lame as Star Wars, hence 2 stars rather than 1, but it definitely did not live up to the promise of its beginnings. I probably would have gotten more out of it if I had left my expectations at home."
4,Finale....That's all there is to it,"Revolutions provides closure to the series. That's the only purpose of the movie. There are no new special effects that set the movie industry by storm, no suspense, no thrills. One thing that this movie promises is the ending, and some people think it's disappointing. Buy this just for collection purposes."
2,This one's a dud. A big disappointment.,"The third and --ye gods!-- most boring of the ""Matrix"" movies. I wasn't wild about the first ""Matrix"" film, but was pretty much on board after seeing #2, considering it a fine, fast-paced, pleasantly pseudo-profound, comicbooky action film. And while this installment started off with a promising action-packed nonchalance, it quickly devolved into a loud, flimsy, poorly plotted morass. Of course, no one needs little old me to tell them about this flick's shortcomings: fans of the series deserted New Zion in droves after this turkey was released... But I still had to check it out and see for myself. Oh, well. By the way, Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinty, Canoe's love interest, is one of the least interesting screen actors I have ever seen. Big flaw in the casting there, which helps drag the series down on a number of occasions."
2,made me appreciate Matrix Reloaded,"The best thing I can say about this 3rd Matrix movie is that it made me appreciate the 2nd movie much, much more.So much promise, so little follow through... sigh.What we really need to see, is not the ""extended director's cut,"" but rather a version that takes the best elements (this would NOT include the George Lucas-like visit to Zion with all it's council meetings, endless discussions and dancing Ewoks...) of these last two movies, cuts out all the Jar-Jar stuff and leaves us with one kick-ass two and a half hour sequel to the Matrix."
3,"Good, but not Great","If anything, Revolutions is a satisfying end to the mediocrity offered up by Reloaded. However, let us not mince words. This movie is NOT the orginal Matrix. Whereas the first Matrix worked in combining cutting edge visual effects with deep philosophical questions (What is real? Are we in control of our own life?, etc.), by now it feels tired and spent. The movie is TOO awash in philosophical dribble that does not work. However, the action and CGI are top notch. The DVD is full of interesting extras, including plenty about how the CGI was done. The movie might not be up to the first Matrix, but the DVD is still worth having."
4,Excellent movie,"It took me a while to see it... but it was worth it. An excellent movie with lots of action ... the ending wasn't what anyone expected, but that's OK (right?).It's not the Lord of the Rings, Shrek/Shrek2 or Alien/Aliens, but they did an awesome job bringing everything together... and I don't care what anyone says -- the action was amazing (from 1 through 3)."
2,A good idea goes bad.,"The W brothers had a massive cult hit with the original Matrix. They had a great idea carried off well. They were stylish and hip and even managed to make Keanu Reeves seem like a real actor. And then they signed a deal for the sequels.Watching this movie, you'll realize exactly what happened. They took all of their advance money and bought big houses and partied for months until the night before the script was due. Then they panicked and threw together a story that had enough elements of the first movie to call it ""The Matrix"". They made it and we bought it and now we're wishing they'd stopped after the first one. I call this George Lucas syndrome."
5,Not What Your Expecting,Okay this movie has gotten some really bad reviews...some people cant just cope with the fact that it is of different style of the last two Matrix Movies. This one is more so a War movie than Kung-Fu kick your ass movie. It has a lot of depth to it. and a lot of emotions in it. The last finght of the movie is really cool...but I thought it could have of been longer and more of the Matrix Style. There are no where near as many fight senes in this movie. Above all I really like it and you just have to accept that its different than the last two.
2,At least its over,"Well what can I say. The consept I guess is good, definatly original. But... What about the characters from the second movie, the two ghost dudes, and who is the guy that runs the subway train to the ""Place in the middle"" of the matrix and the real world. Neo is not even around for most of the movie, then he gets his eyes fried, but of course he can still see. The battle for Zion is cool, it is what makes the movie worth watching. But as for story development, it sucks. I thought they would explain more of how Neo got his powers, I mean they basicaly make him a God. I guess I expected much more from a franchise boasting as much as the Matrix trilogy has. It seems as if nothing from the second movie even made it to the third. Maybe they should have made four movies. Bottom line is its worth watching to finish off the trilogy, but not near as good as the potential that the franchise started of with. The first Matrix is still the best."
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever,"I hope nobody wastes their time watching this movie. It is nearly as bad ""Dreamcatcher."" If you are a fan of movies that have a sense of honesty without being sappy or predictably cheesy, do not watch this movie. You will sit and wish for a respite from your agony."
1,Leave no cliche unuttered,"Oh. My. God.Who ARE you people? Action junkies, apparently. The original was, and remains, one of my favorite films. I reserved judgment on the second because it was obviously just the first part of the third one. Revolutions is easily in my bottom ten of all time. It had a few good moments, sure, but how any writer can look at himself in the mirror after putting that many tired, used lines in one screenplay, I don't understand.In retrospect, it seems clear that BOTH these races, humans and machines, deserve to be wiped out. Has no one ever heard of portable EMP generators? ""Ooooooo, there are thousands of squids here now, guess I'll kick off the EMP. Okay, they're all dead. Lunchtime!"" A few minutes later, from another guy with a suitcase, ""Ahhhhhh, millions of kalamari, boink. Smoke 'em if ya got 'em."" Rinse and repeat.The good guys have ships that don't get destroyed by the EMP, why are the machines too stupid to match that? Give me a break."
1,The matrix downfall,"This was too long, too boring, but had good action sequences! I wouldn't recomend this. And, every person out there who thinks they understand the ending dosen't cause NEO DOSEN'T DIE! Sorry bout that. It is annyoing that people tell me he dies. He dosen't. Once again, this was a dissapointment."
1,I BELIEVE i FIGURED OUT PART OF IT!!!!!!!!,"At the beggining of matrix 3 neo is trapped in the matrix somehow. He seperated his mind from his body is what he thinks. And that one thing kinda leads to an interesting theory...When the bodyguards at the parking lot encounter seriph, one of them calls him wingless. WINGLESS, meaning he cannot fly anymore. Meaning at one point he could fly, like Neo.Here is the point, at the end of revolutions the oracle says we may not have seen the end of neo. You know like the rebirth of christ.(I know it's cheesy)But what she is saying is interesting only because he will return just without wings(human,rebel,side) because his brain may have been altered by the machines but his soul will not. He is still dead but a copy of himself will be part of the system I think.It is interesting to theorize pieces of this movie, but still the rest of this movie needed serious work."
2,Unpleasantly bassy,"I wasn't expecting much from the story, but at least expected a great audio/video experience. I was 2/3rds right. The story is stupid and special effects are great, but the audio is very poor. There is just way too much bass throughout the entire movie. I think extra bass was added for speakers that can't reproduce bass very well. If you have a speaker setup that reproduces bass well, it just makes for an unpleasant listening experience and requires tweaking of your receiver."
2,HOW DARE YOU WACHOWSKI BROTHERS! WHAT IS THIS!?,"WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING!?! THE MATRIX WAS PRETTY GOOD! AND THEN THE MATRIX RELOADED WAS BETTER THAN THAT! AND THEN CAME THIS WORTHLESS LITTLE SPECK! THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY TRILOGY! THE BEST THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT WASN'T AS LONG AS THE OTHERS! IT'S FLASHY, BUT BORING! THE SCRIPT IS PRETTY BAD, AND THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO PLOT. AND WHEN AGENT SMITH GOES (...) AT THE END, THERE'S NO EMOTIONAL IMPACT. THIS IS REALLY NOT WORTH SEEING, SO I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING IMPORTANT. TRINITY GETS IMPALED. THE HUMANS AND THE MACHINES MAKE A TRUCE. A FEW PEOPLE NAMELESS FACELESS PEOPLE GET RIPPED TO SHREDS. NEO KILLS SMITH. NEO DIES TOO. SOME LITTLE GIRL CREATES A SUN IN THE MATRIX. THE END."
2,Dumb,The only good parts of this movie was when the sentinals attacked the city and the DBZ style fighting with Smith. For this i give it 2 stars. I almost fell asleep 5 times and i never fall asleep during movies.
1,Thi movie sucks,This movie sucks. Early in the morning. This movie sucks late in the evening. This was the dumbest movie I have ever seen. Why didn't the machines have covers over the top? Why did they blind Neo? Why did it take Trinty what seems like the entire movie to die? How many chins was Laurence Fishburn going to get? What was the point of the movie if the Matrix was not destroyed? This movie would have better served me as toilet paper. i hope this review was helpful.
2,Extremely disappointing.,"I really enjoyed the first Matrix movie. It was fresh, novel, unique, and not too sure of itself.The second movie was annoying with it's philisophical babble, but the action sequences and fighting was awesome. (It's saving graces, really.) It took itself too seriously, and unfortunatly it tried too hard.This third movie is garbage. Most of the movie I was waiting for _anything_ interesting to happen. I didn't feel compelled by any of the emotional/plot building scenes. There is very little in the way of fighting scenes. One good aspect is the dock fight scene, which is cool. (I'm always a fan of large shot mass warfare scenes.) Other than that the way it all pans out is kind of cryptic, lame, and all too perfect. Most of the action is done with odd flashing lighting making it hard to follow so it ends up looking like chaotic trash.The worst part is they left it wide open for even more crappy sequels."
2,REAL REVOLUTIONS REVIEW,"I'm not going to give anything away, but I want to say that the film is a HUGE disapointment. I will say this much: None of the action or fight sequences comes close to topping Reloaded. The philosphies and the ending are even more confusing. Don't expect any satisfying closure. Just opinion, but see and judge for yourself."
2,What happened?,This movie went wrong in so many ways...Neo is missing in the movie for 45 minutes.isnt the movie about him?..while he is missing an over animated battle between the humans and machines is occuring...second Neo is blinded in the first half of the movie and he puts a purple bandana over his eyes making him look a ninja turtle.third was it me or did the machine god look like the wizard of oz????..come on now...and why was agent smith laughing like Dr Evil????..this was more a comedy than drama...i give it 2 stars for the cool final battle between Neo and Smith which was really weak but cool water effects....shame shame
2,disappointing may be an understatement,"I can't believe how bad the lines and story was. Not near enough fighting, just abunch of pointless .... that didn't amount to anything. By far the worst of the 3 and left a very bad taste in my mouth about the Matrix trilogy."
1,DEBACLE,I really didn't expect much after reloaded but after renting this movie I couldn't believe how bad it really is. This movie sucks so bad I wouldn't even recommend it to my ex girlfriend (...).
4,"Good, but strange","The Matrix Revolutions is a very good movie, but it has too many flashing lights and sound effects. I reccomend this movie for anyone who has seen the first two Matrix movies. This one is better than the second one, but not as good as the first."
4,Actually Quite Good!!!,"Not as good or as mind blowing as the original, but way better than Reloaded. There is more action in this film than the first two combined. The ceiling shootout at the Club Hell, the 20 minute epic battle against the machines, and of course Neo's final rain-soaked confrontation with Agent Smith are great and worth admission price alone. If you were dissappointed with Reloaded, don't give up hope just yet. Revolutions is why we action fans go to the movies!"
1,Revolutions? Revolting!,"Oh my...I walked out of the movie theater very disappointed after seeing The Matrix Reloaded. However, I felt committed to seeing the third in the trilogy having invested so much time in the first two. And I felt semi-confident that the third would be at least as enjoyable as the wonderful first Matrix. Sadly...I was disappointed. Again. And not just a little bit. Majorly. UGH. Halfway through the movie, I was not only wanting my money back...but also the time I had wasted. I couldn't wait for someone -- everyone -- to just die and get this horrible movie over with. So...I do not recommend this. And will never. See the first Matrix. But let it end there."
1,"Why, W. Brothers, Why??","*sigh* Why did the Watchowski Bros. have to go and ruin a wonderful movie by making it a trilogy?If you've read any of the other reviews or seen the trilogy, you know that the last 2 installments were about special effects more than the plot or the acting. Okay, that's a little bit of an understatement.What really bothers me is that there could have been a pretty great sequel if the brothers had just combined the ""plots"" of Reloaded and Revelations and tried to make just one sequel, instead of dragging out a thin plot, measly dialogue, and repetetive fight scenes for two whole movies.The original Matrix was the real Revolution, as far as moviemaking goes. It's too bad the Watchowskis' greed for money lead them to ruin it all. I agree with another review I read; that we should just pretend like Revolutions and Reloaded were never made."
1,the worst matrix ever,"Wow this movie blows! You know it's bad when the cover looks like a damn video game. The battles scenes were soooooo lame, it was funny especially when that commander guy kept on yelling ""GOD DAMNIT!"" That was so funny this movie is so dumb it's funny. I like the other two movies they were tight, the highway scene on the second one was bad ass. But there is no tight fighting scene in this movie, even the final ""showdown"" was dumb, more of a ""let down"" if you ask me. So here's the verdict, the movie sucks!"
1,Am I Watching The Aliens?,"This movie is boring. I feel like I am watching Aliens and Superman. I feel like that they are cutting some sences from Aliens and pasting them here and there... cutting some more from Superman and pasting them over there. Story is not good at all. The movie only mentions the philosophical issues brought up by the second movie. It doesn't really discuss what it is so special about these issues. Most of the time, the movie only mentions the wording. There is no meaning behind the wording.IMO, the second and the third movies switches the focus to Agent Smith. I think they should have more dialogs for Agent Smith rather to just make him punch and punch and punch something all the time everytime I see him show up in the movie.Maybe this is why the movie is so boring. There is nothing to tell regarding The One and his followers anymore. And the contents from the special effects are 10-20 years old. (i.e. you punch me, I punch you back. There is nothing special about this.)"
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen--a total waste!,"Don't waste your money. The original Matrix was a good movie, the second was terrible, and this one was horrible. It was difficult to stay awake during the first half. There were nothing but special effects which were difficult to follow, no plot that made any sense, very little of Neo, and no feeling for any of the characters. It didn't matter to me who lived or who died. The only reason I stayed for the whole movie was to see the outcome. I'm sorry that I did because I only got mad and felt like I was taken."
1,Cinematic excrement.,Watching this is equivalent to being served my own excrement on a dinner plate. Cold. And a few days old.
1,This is what you get when you try to stretch an idea too far,"despite what the claims are, this isn't the third part of atrilogy; it is the second half of a sequel of a film thatshould have been left alonethe original Matrix was a complete story that stood alone (withall the novelty and originality that others have pointed out)Reloaded/Revolutions are a single film, cut in half, thatcouldn't escape from the corner the first film painted theminto.the main problem being that Neo ended the original film as avirtually indestructible super-being; this meant that the'challenges' in the sequel become increasingly over the top(and even silly)combine that with the total change in style in the secondinstallment (seemed more like a video game than a film -- gohere, get this key; go there, talk to that person, get a clue,etc etc), and dissapointment was sure to followi must admit that the scenes in Zion really bothered me, in thatthe squidies just flew around waiting to be shot."
1,Should have been a great series,"After viewing this film all my love for the second installment of the film went completely out the door. The worst thing the distributors of this film could have done was end the second film with to ""be continued"". The third film is bad on so many levels. The film is dismal losing all the glory of the first two films. It loses sight of it's main characters and basically concludes with an ending that negated the whole story line of the initial films. I left the theatre let down that the series I loved so much ended on such a horrible note. I immediately sold back my copy of the second film as I guess (by looking at the ample supply of used Reloaded dvd's) many others did as well. I'll keep the memories of the first film and forget the other two ever happened."
3,MATRIX REVOLUTIONS = MATRIX RELOADED EXTENDED VERSION,"From the creative and visual and phyilosophical experience I had in Matrix and Matrix Reloaded, Matrix Revolutions is not what I expected. 1st : The $ 40 Million action scene at the discotheque...hey I dont' see the $ 40 million reflected in that scene. It's a very good action scene but not a $ 40 million budget. 2nd : extremely too too too too too too too many centinels going in Zion. 3rd : the battle between Agent Smith and Neo is too anime : Smith Flying !!! come on !!!. 4th :About Trinity (you have to see the movie)...I saw Neo puting a great effort in saving her in Matrix Reloaded but in this one NOTHING !!! CERO !!!. 5th : the ending is quite good but there is not a convincing final conclusion. Will there be a Matrix 4 ?."
5,Simply amazing!!,"I strongly agree with the positive reviews that declare this to be one of the best movies of all time. If you haven't seen it yet, please ignore the critic's reviews as they are trained to see the technical aspects instead of being able to just enjoy a movie. This movie takes the viewer further that you could have imagined possible with the characters, plot, and visual effects. It keeps you glued to your seat and always wanting more. I never thought Neo and Trinity could make your love their characters more, but this movie does that and SO much more! I really got into the movie and felt like I was living and doing right along with the characters. I promise you that you will love it!!!"
2,What a waste of time,"okay.. this movie was a MAJOR disappointment. Here are my complaints:1. Where is the philosophical issues dealt with thru matrix and matrix reloaded?2. Having a massive war scene and leaving out Neo and Trinity for about 40 minutes was completely stupid. I sat there wondering what was happening to them.3. It completely lost the cold hard edge the first matrix had.4. I feel they should have done more with the train guy, and how you can get stuck between the matrix and the real world.5. Needed more guns.6. The big fight scene at the end... there was nothing new, except for the stupid air bit. how stupid.7. Movie overall was too fragmented, didnt have a flowing story line, and was more of a romance then a philosophical movie. ... nuff said."
1,"Matrix Revolution, not a film revolution","Matrix Revolution shows not only accepted diminishing artisticreturn, but in view of the first Matrix movie an even greater downfall. Matrix set up an ongoing phantasy that would only have been sustained by an equally good story line photography and inventive action. Not so, Matrix Revolution capitalizes on action scenes already proved in Matrix and the story line comes too close to the Dune Machine Crusade and neither resolves nor enlightens the conflict. I expected much more and had faith in the film makers here, who are not the Hollywood standard, but still fell victim to their earlier success.The actor's emphasis on performing their own stunts did not improve the story, neither did the change in characters, i.e. the oracle and crew.The machine war was visually interesting, had it not been exploited in length and repetition.The failure is the story line and resolution."
1,Too bad...,"I do not recommend at all to buy this movie. Go buy Matrix 1. That was a great movie. This one isn't. I think we need to e-mail staff for matrix 2 & 3 and tell them to ask LOTR's staff on ""How To Make a GOOD Trilogy and NOT to DIE trying"". Its a pity they didnt know how to continue such a great story."
1,Schlock,"Below average sci-fi schlock. Despite decent special effects, I was bored to tears. Silly plot, stale love scenes, no hot women, no car chases, etc., etc. Unless the actors worked for free, they were vastly overpaid. I just bought this movie for $5 and I feel ripped off. In good conscience, I can't even recommend renting this p.o.s."
1,Worst final installment ever!,"Apparently I watched a different third installment than the previous review. I was ready to turn it off after about half way through this boring, ridiculously idiotic final episode. The childish simplicity that they wrap this trilogy of movies up with is something I would have expected to see on the sci fi channel. BUT...if you still feel the need to watch this incredible borefest, at least do yourself a favor and watch it in HD!! The visual effects will at least take your mind off the fact that you have seen the WORST final episode of a trilogy ever made!"
3,Neo=Frodo?,"Man, at one point in this movie i felt like i was watching a futuristic version of the Return of the King. Frodo--err Neo and his companion venture to the heart of darkness alone, whilst the remaining forces of man battle the impossible army of the machines--err Sauron? All in all a very entertaining movie, but the over-over dramatic tete-a-tetes became tired even in Reloaded, and most of the acting was 2nd-rate in my opinion. Even the choral doom-laden soundtrack became too much in the end."
3,late delivery,"Delivery took a while. Seller never replied to e.mail messages, but finally shipped the item."
2,This trilogy was a downward spiral.,"Definitely the worst matrix movie. It was a disappointing and stupid ending. It's as if the director(s) had just said ""oh, bugger this,"" and neglected the salvagable story. I bet I could have written something better than this. There was definitely lots of balls-to-the-wall action in Zion(hence the 2-star rating), but the Neo/Smith battle was kind of cheesy. Get the Return of the King instead."
1,"Weak, Weak, Weak! This movie doesn't even deserve 1 star","This movie is absolutely horrible. I've seen it about 10 times, so I know what I'm talking about. As a matter of fact, all three of these movies are horrible. None of them are enjoyable to watch. The special effects are so 1980s. I can't believe some dorks like this movie. This is quite possibly the worst trilogy of all time. Right behind Star Wars. I would give it zero stars if I could.Pick up the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy instead. The special effects in THIS trilogy will blow your mind."
2,Matrix Revolutions,"A major let down, gloomy from start to finish. Mentioning no names but killing off two of the main charachters did not help.The likes of Larry Fishburne and Lambert Wilson are woefully under-used, two great charchters that made Reloaded great!However the final showdown between Smith & Neo stands out, a great set piece that reminds me of Superman 2!Jada pincket Smith and Marvin Gay's daughter are very sexy."
5,"by far, the BEST MOVIE i've ever seen in my entire life!!!",Uniquely intelligent. Super Genious. Biblical connection (search for this book's ISBN 1576834786).http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?o=1&l;=as1&f;=ifr&t;=hitpulse-20&p;=8&asins;=1576834786&IS2;=1&lt1;=_blank(copy n paste this link)also see this: http://hollywoodjesus.com/matrix_reloaded.htmJust the BESTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT movie!! You'll never regret to see this!!
2,What a snooze fest,Matrix Reloaded was awesome. This was just a horrible let down. Normally its the #2 in the trilogy that is the dog. Wasn't the case here.
5,better then most people think,The final movie. Kill or be kill. The humans are tring their best to fight those machines they even have big machines themselves were they can go inside and control which makes it easier on them. Trinity died for good this time. And Neo in the end fight agent Smith I wish the fighting was a bit faster but what a good ending to the whole matrix series.
2,the matrix- revolting,"The final installment of this trilogy is proof that cgi does not a movie make. Plenty of mindless action scenes for you fake-fight fans, lots of empty dialogue for you drama fans- they tried to cover all the bases and succeded in covering none. This movie did evoke some reaction out of me- i was yawning the whole time."
2,Somebody Get Me the Blue Pill..........................,"I really need to forget I ever saw this movie. After the first two GREAT movies, I just knew this one was going to be awesome. They had such a great story working, and the groundwork they laid for this one in ""Reloaded"" had me salivating. But, then I saw this mess. The story in ""Revolutions"" didn't even seem related to the other two. Although it did have some nice special effects, the plot was poorly explained and the resolution of the story made no sense. It's like they opened up all these great angles in the first two but had no idea how to resolve them. This movie could and should have been ten times better. Wait for video."
2,Messy conclusion to a great story,"From the end of The Matrix: Reloaded we know Neo is back in the real world, we know something is different about him and we know in the last film somehow he is going to save the world. The Matrix: Revolutions opens where reloaded left off, but almost immediately the movie feels entirely different. From the first five minutes on the movie leads up the battle for Zion. This would be alright, the problem is the movie drags on slowly with a whole lot of nothing happening untill the machines reach Zion, Neo's character is isolated and becomes weaker and weaker, in the end he does save day (no big surprise), but the method is a cheap shop by the screenwriters, the big end battle for Zion is instantly forgetable (all 20+ minutes of it) and we're left with no clouser, what's worse the ending is left wide open for even more Matrix movies."
3,not too good not too bad,well the final chapter in the matrix series has come to an end and it was not what alot of fans expected who were all waiting 4 years to see what would happpen to neo and the gang and it ended and we still don't know what has happen to neo and the gang over there in zion. the brothers have left us guessing as if this is the end or not. in all the movie is nice . a romace a war story and a sci fi mystery. i am hoping for a part four something like matrix 7.0 seeing that neo has finallly found out he is the 6 version of a computer error in the matrix. well i overall the triology is a good one. the story is good the vfx are pleasing but the ending needed work. maybe the bros should take a page from peter jackson on his LOTR trilogy to see visa vi how you should end a trilogy for the loyal fans.
4,Great third movie,I loved the entire movie right until the end. I was not happy with the end. In case you have not seen it I won't give it away but remember my review once you have seen the end of the movie. I would have given the movie 5 starts except of course for the end.
3,Played entire CD once; replayed Leather & Lace a couple of times.,She may have written them.....but I'd like more passion. Thought maybe it was in the lyrics and I missed it....I'll listen in the Spring again.
3,Bella Donna!,A Good album by Stevie Nicks. Her vocals and poetic lyrics really shine through and this album has good music on it. With 80's tracks and also a bit of hard rock and country. Stevie Nicks belladonna is a good effort that music lovers should check out.
5,5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH!!!!!,"I don't know what all to say about this, other than it is THE BEST album ever produced! I don't know how this deserves less than a 5 Star rating. It CANT BE BEAT!!!"
3,A Moment In History,"Solo Album by Stevie Nicks from Fleetwood Mac. Personally, I'm not sure how it ever achieved #1 on the Billboard Top 200. I think the Fleetwood Mac history boosted reviews and sales considerably. That aside, it is a decent album. She had about 5 years that she collected tracks over. The SNL (and other) jokes about Stevie Nicks mumbling aren't evident on this CD. The single Stop Draggin' My Heart Around - duet w/Tom Petty has had nearly constant air play and many people (me included) are somewhat burnt out on hearing it. The overall range of style - including a touch of country leaves me with the feeling of thematic weakness. A decent digitization of the original album."
4,Stevie is a Goddess living on Earth,"A few of the songs on this CD sound like TV commercials.....but the rest of them make up for it, and how. ""After The Glitter Fades"" is very country-sounding, it's one of my favorite songs, and I HATE COUNTRY MUSIC, I even have a bumper sticker that says so. If you have only heard Stevie Nicks in Fleetwood Mac, then get this. It will blow you away. Just make sure you have the ""program"" option on your CD player."
4,Great cd but,"All of the tracks on this cd are great but, where is the re-issue and digitally remastered versions of stevie solo cd's...They should be out by now!"
5,Magnificent! Splendid!,"The first time I listened to this album, I didn't like it at all. Now I adore it. Stevie carries on the tradition of ""Rhiannon"", ""Dreams"", and ""Sara"" with a new twist. Every song is different, and all are delightful. Some are lonely and wistful, some are upbeat and exciting. Duets with Don Henley (on ""Leather and Lace"" and ""The Highwayman"") and Tom Petty (on ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around"") produce some really great music. Any Stevie or Fleetwood Mac fan will love this record. My favorite songs are ""Leather and Lace"", ""The Highwayman"", ""After the Glitter Fades"", and ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around"". Rock on, Stevie!!"
4,A big album with a lot of help from famous friends,"It's been a difficult ride for Stevie Nicks outside of Fleetwood Mac. Most of her solo efforts have been wildly uneven often plagued by multiple producers who couldn't quite put their finger on her style and had their own ideas of what she should sound like. Bella Donna is the exception - almost every track is a keeper and the production is almost perfect, thanks to Jimmy Iovine, who at Nicks's request, duplicated successfully the big open drum and guitar sound of Patti Smith's Easter album. Add to the mix Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, various members of the Eagles, and beautiful layers of Nicks's own backing vocals and you have quite an album. Most of it was recorded live in the studio so this was the first time many people really heard how powerful Stevie can sing when she wants to. Bella Donna marks the beginning of Stevie Nicks as ""rock and roll singer"" - very possibly the best there is in this country (since Janis Joplin)."
5,BELLADONNA & STEVIE NICKS OUTSTANDING,"This is an excellent CD capturing Stevie's soul. Her timeless songs and how she sings them are phenomenal. My favorites from this CD are Bella Donna, Kind of Woman, Think About, It EDGE OF SEVENTEEN - I just love that song no matter how many times I play it I love it even more.This is a ""must buy"" for listening and you'll definitely want to get some of her DVD's for super great enjoyment.This work was deeply important to Stevie, as she shares that she wanted to do this her entire life.She proves to be an outstanding solo artist, and gets better and better note by note.Can't wait for the concert next month - after 34 years I FINALLY get to see Stevie live. She is truly amazing!10 Stars!"
4,Stevie's voice is Bella...,...I enjoy this album which is her first and I think best. Hear this album. Fall in love with this album.
3,Light Weight Swing!,"Greg Piccolo, the former band leader for the Roomful of Blues scores a very generous 3 star rating with this debut release. The songs on the release lean heavily toward a swing sound, which was going through bit of a retro revival during the time of this release. There are two or three tunes that do not follow the swing, big band formula and are really quite good. Most notably, ""Bolo Blues"", and ""Pic's Gospel Groove"" which have more of a time lasting jazz feel to them. If you like swing, you will find that the three stars are appropriate and maybe even a little understated. However, traditional blues fans, and even Roomful of Blues fans will probable find a 3 star rating very generous."
2,Pass this one by :(,"I have to agree with Krystal in that I didn't like this character at all. The story never felt right to me. I kept waiting to for a reason to like these characters as a couple. Even by the end, I still didn't feel that Donavan really cared about Faye at all except for good sex. Which, because of the way Donavan acted, wasn't believable or satisfying. I have read many books by DP and this is one that I could have done without. If you are looking for a good DP romance with passion and connection between the characters try ""Fire and Ice,"" ""His girl Friday,"" ""Evan,"" or ""Lawless."""
4,"Ten Foot Pole: For you, not them.","""Insider"" is something I'd call just a step up from ""Unleashed"". This is a very very neato album. The first song ""The Getaway"", pretty much sets the pace for the album. Fast, upbeat, slightly hardcore. Very nice. Highly recommended."
4,Very good!,"This cd is very good. I like all the songs except the very last track. The songs that stand out are ""The Getaway"" and ""Another Half Apology""."
2,Ten Foot Pole should change their name since Scott left band,"Ten Foot Pole will never be the band they were originally. Since Scott's departure from the band, they have become nothing more than a whiney, annoying, poppy piece of crap. If you want to hear the dope shiznit then peep the flizzow on all of PULLEY's stuff and also the original TFP's first album. Peace-out, YO."
3,Not great,"It's not the best, but not the worst punk out there. I think that they are a shadow of their former selves, but hey, that's just my opinion. Some good songs, but not a lot. Best just to download the songs you want to hear."
4,siicckk!,"I remember the first time i herd TEN FOOT POLE. It was at a punk show at the Palace, in Los Angeles, CA. I had never herd them befor that night, but after that night punk was never the same. TEN FOOT POLE rips! This album is just another example of how much TEN FOOT POLE kicks a!!!"
3,Not very impressed,This album is okay. I like a few of the songs. Does talk about some great issues. Unleashed and Rev are som much better. p.s. I keep on reading that ten foot poles only other album rev is so good. Well Scott put out a other album with ten foot pole called Swill. They also put out a split cd with the satanic surfers.
4,Worth Reading!,"This book read like a college text. However, it contains a lot of important information and scientific data that has been forbidden because it does not complies with the social, scientific and religious mainstream. The book stands by its own weight and presents and analyzes a part of the history that is not written. I do not agree with other people that say that this book is pseudoscience. Like always to many reputations on the firing line! Pseudoscience for the people who thinks, 'If it rewrites history it is not true!'"
4,Evidence Presented Here Needs More Attention,"Between the scientific evidence and the common theme of ancient legends presented, this book, at a minimum, raises some very interesting questions. Are we naive to not take these legends seriously? Are we in general, afraid to interpret the scientific evidence in a way we may not want to accept? Maybe we need to begin to entertain the idea that earth changes happen more frequently than is conventionally accepted. This book may be a beginning. Excellent reading, I enjoyed it!!!"
4,Good book,It's a good book but too long. They could have said what they wanted to say in half as many pages.
2,Don't waste your time,"This book goes on and on ad nauseum and has a lot of grainy photographs presumably to support the idea of a cataclysmic disaster roughly 10,000 years ago, but it never really gets to the point.I got more out of the foreward by Rand Flem-Ath who summed it all up succinctly bymentioning a rougue star careening into the solar system and causing widespread destruction.You'd be better off to read Velikovsky."
1,Velikovskyites--Rally 'round,"This book is another in a series of conglomerations of pseudo-science, where limited amounts of facts are admixed with a surfeit of ad hominem conclusions, and presented as a finished exercise in studied thought. To say the least, although an atmosphere of copious study is fashioned, the result is sheer balderdash.The theory of extraterrestrial cataclysm set out is extraordinary, and the supportive proofs meager. Instead, the book relies on superstition, obscure and mystical folklore, and speculation, and the hard evidence is lacking.At least it was my friend, and not me who wasted the money this time. I got stuck on Bell and Streiber's ""The Coming Superstorm"", which was just as bad, if less artful. Both books are in the category of being entertaining page turners for short-hop flights, but which should be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. Don't waste your money on either one."
4,Earth in Upheaval ?,"This is a great source of information on a rather involved and controversial subject. The writing style is a bit old school and often many words are used when few would suffice. For a non - uniformitarian view of Earth's not so distant past, this book is both controversial and thought provoking. Building on theories once postulated in the controversial 'Worlds in Collision' this delves deeper into the geologic record and human ancient archives to paint a much more plausible and compelling view of a time when the Earth trembled and laid waste to many nations. This is one subject we would be wise to take too lightly in light of those who hold to the importance of the 2012 idea of a new world age beginning on the remains of the one we know today.Cataclysm!: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C."
5,Optimization of Common Sense,"When the Earth Nearly Died is a book that should become standard text for all high school students. It not only combines the basic sciences into practical use in a meaningful way, but also puts emphasis on the value of human testimonies, even when laden with description beyond our current understanding. The proof of testimonies is cleverly given by the repitition of basic structure in several civilizations separated by oceans. I would add that the reference to prior well developed civilizations may indeed someday point the way towards understanding that a lot of ""mythology"" was a well conceived plan by well developed people to implant information in the mind of not-so-well-educated folks to carry forward to the day when their educated offspring can understand the true meaning of the ""story"""
2,Bad idea,My daughter loves having these in the tub. BUT the only thing she does with them is try to drink out of them. The water also rarely turns the wheel unless poured directly on it. If you don't mind your kids drinking the bath water they will love these. If you do I suggest finding something else.
5,Brilliant work,"This author is not only a good friend of mine but also a very passionate writer who believes in his work. I was there for him when he went through alot of hard times and I am glad to see that he has overcome many of the trials and tribulations of life. I admire him for being the strong person that he is cause he could hsve called it ""quits"" at any time. My wife also enjoyed reading his poems and stated that she felt that they were truly from his heart. Keep doing what you do Jack, I love you like a brother. I am still awaiting to read the book that you were writing whlie we were in Jacksonville, Florida. Just Simply Brilliant Work!!!Your Friend,Tony Ross"
5,"Heather, you rock!!","I know Heather Sharfeddin personally. I raise Blackbelly Sheep. I grew up in rural Idaho just a few miles from where Heather grew up. With all that being said, I loved this book. I read it in one day just days after it was released. I didn't want it to end. I still think of the characters and wonder how they are and what they are doing. As I was reading the first few pages, I kept thinking how amazing it was that Heather was the writer and that I knew her. It was not long before she took me away from that and led me into the lives of her characters. I am buying this book for almost everyone on my Christmas list. One of the best reads ever--and I read a lot!!"
2,I can't agree with all these reviews,"I bought and read this book based on all the favorable, enthusiastic reviews. I am at a total loss to understand how not one person gave this book less than five stars. It read more like a romance book than a suspense or well-developed novel. The characters changed at the writer's whim. Not believable. People don't change that fast and that frequently. The plot was totally predictable. A disappointing book."
2,Abstraction,"As a whole, Adam Schaefer's ""The Life and Work Of..."" series of books on artists, aimed at young readers, is excellent; this particular selection, however, lacked the enthusiasm of most other titles. The best part of the book discusses Calder's work creating circus animal sculptures, and this topic will surely appeal to students. The latter portion of the book, however, is devoted to the artist's abstract sculptures, and considering the audience level for which this book was written, the author does not quite bring the genre to life for a young mind unfamiliar with such terms and concepts. More attention, perhaps, should have been paid to Calder's mobile sculptures and the effect his popularization of this invention had on the world in general."
5,Foley Food Mill,This is an incredible piece of equipment. I owned my previous one for over 20 years before it broke. It makes incredible applesauce.
3,Not as well made as the one my mom had,Unfortunately this is lightly made so parts bend if you are not very careful. Also the blade is not close to the edge of the bowl so what you are trying to strain squishes out and must be scooped down to finish.
4,Works great!,"I've never owned or used a food mill before. I bought it for canning and used it for the first time a couple of days ago. I planted a crab apple tree a few years ago and it's been loaded with fruit the past couple of years. I've made crab apple jelly, but that leaves you with so much wasted fruit so though I'd never heard of crab apple butter, I thought I'd give it a try (it's fantastic, btw). Last year I used a sieve and man my arms were aching after pushing all that cooked fruit through. This year, I couldn't believe how quick and easy it was to run the fruit through the food mill. Before I knew it I was done and ended up with over twenty jars of the stuff from one tree. Last year I only got half that amount. Yay! As others have mentioned, the handle is quite uncomfortable (hence the four instead of five stars), but I just wrapped a dish towel around it and it was ok."
3,not quite what was expected,"I ordered this product on recommendation from a favorite canning-how-to site. The site stated that you could make applesauce with this Foley Food Mill. I tried it and it does make applesauce easily, separating the liquid from the solid but does NOT separate the core, peel, etc. as the canning site stated...you will still need to peel and core the apples first. I couldn't find any instructions on the Foley Food Mill anywhere online or with the product when it arrived. It will only fit a specific sized pot or bowl. It's a little difficult to clean. I gave it three stars because it has no product info, no way to contact a company regarding the product should you need to replace it, nothing.For the price I paid, I really am a bit disappointed. When you consider how difficult it is to clean, I'd say use a hand masher instead."
2,missing instructions,"This product is a wonderful piece of equipment to puree, strain, and mash fruits and vegetables. One problem, I had know knowledge of how to use. After many attempts to get instructions--was told no instructions came with the foodmill, I finally figured out how to use. I will never purchase from ACE Hardware again. Customer service very rude and nasty."
4,Good value,"I think for the money this food mill works, but I don't really have much to compare it to since I've never used one before this. It purees the soups I've made with it really well. My arms hurt after a while but I think that's to be expected..."
2,not as good as the original,"My mom has a foley food mill that is 25 years old and works great. I wanted the same thing, but this is not. It looks the same, but they just don't make it like they used to. The blade doesn't line up will with the bottom, so the handle wobbles and you have to be very precise with your pressure when you turn the crank, or it gets stuck, and becomes difficult to turn. I used it to make applesauce, and it is very inefficient. It takes many more turns than the old one to push through the same amount of applesauce. Also, it says it's made of stainless steel, but something black was dripping into my applesauce from the center of the food mill. I think it was some kind of metal or interaction with the apples. I had nothing in the food mill but apples cooked with water. We had to throw out the applesauce!"
4,If only a real handle were there,"Shortly after receiving the Foley Food Mill we put it to the test, making about 14 quarts of applesauce. It worked great and was very easy to clean. The milling function was efficient and easy, once you get the art of when to clear the bottom down. The only thing that keeps this from being a five star review is the handle, which is just two metal rods. It REALLY needs to have a true solid rounded handle in order to prevent hand cramps and pains. I finally used a hand towel wrapped several times around the handle to cushion the grip.That aside, this is all as promised and then some."
3,"Hard to use, but food is well milled","I bought this to make apple butter last fall. It did mill the food well and was easy to put together.However, the little feet that are supposed to hold the mill over the pot are VERY flimsy. I had to spend half my energy pushing down on the handle so the food would mill properly, and the other half of my energy pushing upward to hold the food mill over the pot, because any downward pressure on the mill when it was just resting on the feet caused the feet to bend up and the mill to slide down into the pot, incidentally scraping the inside sides and the rim of the pot. When I tried using a smaller pot, (so it was the mill itself and not the feet that were resting on the edge of the pot) the mill just wobbled so much that I had to go back to the larger pot and just live with the feet problem.If the feet were made of some stronger material I would give this 5 stars, but the way it is, it takes twice as much effort to work as it should, which is a big drawback."
1,"If I could give it NO stars, I would!","Years ago I bought a secondhand Foley food mill to make baby food for my daughter (who is now in her thirties). It was a great tool, and I thought I would ""replace"" it for canning and processing fruit and berries. This product DOES NOT replace the authentic item. The item is wobbly, flexes out of round when you try to use it, scrapes the food around and around, but never pushes it through the grate. It is completely useless and I returned the one I bought within 24 hours. Extremely disappointing."
2,They don't make 'em like they used to.,"I have a Foley Food Mill I bought used over 35 years ago. It is stainless, with a traditional (i.e., non-loop) handle (comfortable to hold) and, most important, is amazingly well constructed -- unlike today's thin, tinny versions, which have been ""cheapened down.""My ancient Foley has withstood my 35 years of use plus the previous owner's untold years'.You won't believe this, but I found it at a garage sale. Price: $.25."
3,Foley Mill,Have not tried this yet but tired of borrowing one from my daughter. Went for the larger size because of the amount that I process.
3,my old one was better!,"I had a food mill that I used for years. I think it was the same brand. I finally replaced it because the plating was wearing off. The new one is nice and shiny but when I make applesauce (which is all I really use it for) it does about half of the apples just fine, then the rest just seems to sit on top or around the edges rather than going through. It seems to allow the apples too much space around the edge so that they don't get caught and pushed through the mill. By continually pushing the apples under with a spatula I can get the job done but it's not very efficient."
4,"Overall, a good product","We ordered these food mills specifically for making apple butter. My mother has one that is very similar that she has had for many years but needed replacing. There are 2 things that I would consider possible ""pit-falls"". First the wire handle is a little uncomfortable; wish it were solid. But that's easily remedied with a cloth. Then other thing is the clips that help hold the mill on the pan. These clips are pretty flimsy. When making apple butter, you need to apply a bit of pressure to get all the pulp worked through. Although the clips didn't break off, they did bend a bit. I had to bend them back a couple of times. Overall, a pretty good product. We processed 2 bushels of apples without any real problems."
5,Mirro/Foley 50025 3.5 Quart Food Mill,"I received my Foly food mill quickly by parcel post with free shipping...I chose the 3.5 quart size to primarily do tomatoes. So quickly and easily freeze tomatoes for a very fresh tasting tomato sauce and juice for soups or just to drink. Don't ruin tomatoes by cooking them to death. Just use the food mill to take the juice out and cook the sauce quickly. You can even use canned tomatoes to extract the juice and make a wonderful sauce. My wife makes the most wonderful vegetarian tomato sauce with the remaining pulp. When I freeze tomatoes, I use the whole tomato. So quick and easy: wash them, core them, chop them slightly with a food processor or mash them with a potato masher, put them in the food mill and easily turn the handle one way and them the other way to let the juice drain. Pour the entire pulp sans juice into clean recycled plastic quart or smaller containers and freeze. For an heirloom tomato sauce recipe, email me barnabbyss1@gmail.com"
1,poorly made,"Making tomato sauce, the handle fell off on the second day I used it. Reading the reviews, this has happened to others. It was just kind of pressed on to it, not even soldered or welded that I could see. The front hooks were constantly bending because the metal was too thin. It worked okay otherwise but with the handle falling off, it wouldn't sit on a pot so it was worthless. Foley might have made a great mill at one time but the ones they make now are junk."
2,They don't make them like.....,"I inherited a 1 quart Foley from my Mom, but needed a larger one. I also thought that the old one wasn't performing like it should have because it took a lot of work to process the food. I make lots of V-8 and applesauce, so the larger one appeared to be the one for me. After using it for the V-8 season, I must say I'm disappointed. The construction is not near the quality of my older model. The metal that is used is of a lower quality than the older model. The paddle that mashes the food against the graters doesn't contact the bottom of container all the way around the rotation. The pivot point appears to be ""out of wack"". I'm using the new one because of the volume, but finish the job with my old model to complete the process. Knowing what a great product it could have been, it's a disappointment."
5,Well worth the money,"This is a must have if you are canning any recipe with tomatoes. I started the season peeling and seeding all my tomatoes by hand, got this mid stream and was kicking myself for not getting it earlier. This rocks, it makes seeding and peeling a breeze! I haven't tried using for applesause but that is next!"
5,As seen and expected,It was exactly as it was shown and similar to one I had had for 50 years. This product was bigger than my old Mirro and Stainless steel which is appreciated.
3,Mill,Ths works well for the most part. It did not work well with tomatoes. Mashed potatoes were much better. I've only used it a few times. Cleans up easily. Would buy it again.
1,Worthless,"I bought this several years ago and I'm replacing it because it just doesn't get the job done. Most of the food remains mashed inside instead of coming out the bottom, and it takes a lot of downward pressure to get anything out. The bottom adjustment knob with the spring is very hard to adjust and requires pliers to turn it. This food mill is one piece and does not have removable discs, so it's one size only and very hard to clean."
1,Broke the first time I used it!,"I used it to make apple sauce. First it leaked black grease from the middle bolt into the sauce, and it broke using it on soft apples. Horrible and disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I used an ""old"" Foley food mill for years and when it finally wore out I was excited to replace it with this new stainless steel one. I have used it a few times and am very disappointed in its performance. It does not grind as close and so leaves a lot of residue behind that should be in the applesauce. I takes more elbow grease to try to complete the job. I hunted around and found another ""old"" one and am much happier with that than with the new one.Mirro 50025 Foley 3.5-Quart Stainless Steel Food Mill Cookware, Silver"
2,Not very good,"I have never read the book, and all I know of the story is what I saw in this movie. I don't think the story was developed very well. There was little dialogue and little to show that Anna was interested in Vronsky until all of sudden she's crazy about him. It's surprising also when she says his love for her has faded and thinks he is going to marry someone else -- We hadn't really seen anything to lead us to that conclusion. So the end is especially tragic because watching this movie you can't even tell if she was right in her suspicions. Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the quality of the picture and audio was poor."
1,BEWARE! THIS IS NOT THE GARBO VERSION,"As the illustration clearly shows, the Cliff Notes version is the one starring Vivien Leigh, not Greta Garbo. The single star rating does not apply to the quality of either movie, but exists to call attention to this mistake."
2,Vivien`s least interesting as a star,"Vivien suffered from both TB and manic depression after the making of CEASAR AND CLEOPATRA 1945. Here, her strength and stamina are all gone.... The production values are good, as are Ralph Richardson. Only their confrontation scene in the bedroom survives and it's sad to see her in this film."
2,What a shame!,"I can barely review the movie: everyone knows a movie adaptation of a great book like Anna Karenina is bound to have shortcomings. But let me tell you about this heck of a ghastly DVD production! Who on earth is behind this sloppy transfer? The movie was made in 1948, but you'd think it was 1918, looking at the hideously blurry, fuzzy, melted frames, and chopped soundtrack. Funny color gizmos even appear sometime for a split second on the screen, definite signs of the little care that was paid to the DVD production of this otherwise decent movie. A reviewer here mentionned the error in the poster on the cover (yes, that's Garbo indeed): if only that was the only sloppiness in this DVD output! Shame shame shame......"
2,Vivien Leigh`s worst performance,"Vivien Leigh was the 20th Century`s greatest screen actress, but she had a most delicate health. She suffered both from manic depressions and turbercoloses. She had just recovered from her first attacks when she starred in this Korda version. It`s quite visible that her strength and stamina was gone. She only excelled in the confrontation scene with Richardson. It`s sad to see her in this movie."
2,"Great movie, but I'd go for the full 134 min Oz edition with better transfer.","I had to do some hunting, but I finally found the Australian edition of this epic movie from umBrella Entertainment which was the full 134 min version. I found it at an Australian Borders bookstore. The transfer is amazing on this DVD, well compared to another US edition of the movie which looks like it was filmed in 1901 and simply transfered from VHS to DVD after 109 years of playing without any clean up. (it's the one with the cover which looks as if someone has done a cheap water-colour painting)The umBrella edition has a beautiful, solo picture-sleeve of Vivian Leigh in a brown-tone colour with the film's title as ""Tolstoy's immortal love story Anna Karenina.I'd also like to thank other reviewers on amazon.com who actually brought to my attention that the US edtion was edited, you saved me buying the wrong version."
4,GREAT ~ but No Match for Garbo as Anna Karenina!,"My husband and I had recently purchased and watched Gone With the Wind, so we wanted to acquire more movies starring Vivian Leigh. Albeit Greta Garbo was much better in the role of Anna Karenina, this movie is worth having, if you love Vivian Leigh and Tolstoy."
3,"Well, I liked the ending...","This is my least favorite version of Anna Karenina. As an older movie it's intriguing, but I found it lacking in a few areas. The story of Kitty and Levin was pushed off to the side, so we miss the grand comparison of the ""more pure"" relationship with the ""devastatingly corrupt"" one. Vivien Leigh was a gorgeous Anna and portrayed her well, but Kieron Moore seemed too young to play Vronsky.The movie opens and closes with trains. The Last Train Scene was really powerful. Great angles, especially the final shot.I prefer Masterpiece Theater'sAnna Karenina (2000). EvenAnna Karenina (1997) [Region 2] is better, especially with Sean Bean and its Tchaikovsky soundtrack."
3,I can't believe it,"This version of Tolstoi's classic isn't as good as the Garbo version, no doubt, although the lovely Vivien tries her best. What gets me is that they have chosen the wrong poster for the DVD edition, cause it's clearly Garbo who is in it, as any good fan could tell you. How can it be?"
2,"Good, But Not Great","Good, but not great. I'm a big fan of John Williams and have almost all his soundtracks. Given the fact that this was a SCI-FI action film, I had high hopes for some exciting new music. However, I found the music to be very obscure and even odd at times. Some of the music sounded like classical music and I don't mean classical soundtrack music- I mean classical chamber music written in the 18th century. It was very distracting. Other music (during the chase scenes) sounded like re-hashed tracks from Attack Of The Clones. Usually I leave the theater with the songs in my head, but I did not remember a single track from this one. But perhaps that's the sound that the director wanted. Personally, I found the soundtrack to ""Bourne Identity"" by John Powell a lot better and can't help wondering what it would have been like if he had done the score."
3,'Sounded better in the theater,"Grant it, I don't have the luxury of the expensive AND expansive system at the local multiplex. However, this score is one of those that MUST accompany the film. It really has no ""life"" outside of the on-screen antics.Most of Williams's greatest scores have achieved that status because they can stand alone on their orchestral merits. ""Close Encounters"", ""Star Wars"", ""Superman"", ""Jaws"", and ""Schindler's List"" benefit from strong melodic themes essential to the story, as well as being memorable long after one has left the movie house.Sadly, the score for the latest Spielberg offering just doesn't cut it. The more that I listen to it, the weaker it becomes.From Williams, I expect much, much more."
4,Lacks a theme,"This is a good soundtrack. No doubt about it. All the action cues for this film are very good. However John Williams forgot to put in an Emotional theme to the soundtrack which should have serve as a centerpiece.(For example the ""Love Theme "" from Star Wars Episode 2 was the centerpiece theme for that Soundtrack)That being said John Williams did a great job for this film. But this music is no means in the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" catagory.Worth cheking out."
2,Problems with the actual recording...,"I liked the music from Minority Report, but rather than talk about the soundtrack itself (because I figure you've seen the film otherwise you wouldnt be here, and you've got many other reviews here talking about the music) I'd like to mention the recording quality of the CD which is EXTREMELY POOR!I have an expensive stereo system and for a modern recording I was severly dissapointed in the quality of the mastering. It hisses, it pops, I thought I was listening to vinyl!!!! Maybe you can't here it on low volumes, or if other stereo systems have more bass which hide it? Personally, I like listening to my music LOUD and this recording SUCKS!"
3,Not one of my faves...,"This one falls a little flat for me, especially having come out around the same time as the far superior AI soundtrack. Considering the remainder of Williams' body of work, I'll forgive this one."
2,Hollywood,"From what I have heard of this CD, it seems that yet another composer is being over stretched in the hollywood machine. The music sounds pretty average for Williams, I'm sure he worked hard on it, but when he has a Star Wars score to do among others, I'm not suprised that it sounds a little like some of his other recent scores ie. Ai. I had hoped for something in the vain of Bladerunner, but alas how many composers working in Hollywood have the time to make something original..."
3,Decent Williams,"Though it worked well in the film, the score is not the greatest piece to listen too. ""Minoirty Report"" is a good and strong orchestra and percussion start. The next few pieces are nothing special. ""Spyders"" is the next action piece, and it works pretty well. ""Eye Dentiscan"" is an enjoyable orchestra piece. ""Everybody Runs"" is a continuation of the action theme. ""Sean's Theme"" is the emotional work with a nice touch of piano. ""Anderton's Great Escape"" is a face paced wonderful action piece. Overall, the work is still strong, but, in the end, there is nothing 'classic' about the score."
5,Minority Rapport,"Williams' music sometimes overwhelms a film and I think the most effective score is the unnoticed one. But aside from a few preposterous fight and chase scenes, I love ""Minority Report"" and its score.I'll leave it at that. There are other posters who are far more eloquent. You owe it to yourself to watch ""Minority Report."" It is so good in so many ways. Agatha in the window seat always makes me tear up.This is the type of movie that inspires others to make movies."
4,"Cute, Soft Unicorn toy","so ya, I bought this for myself, I'm 26....but I LOVE unicorns!!! It's so fluffy and cute. It's made really well. Is a great toy for a little kid I'm sure. But it's sitting on my shelf :) It looks great along side my unicorn bandaids"
5,Great plush,"This unicorn is the cutest, softest animal. It retains its color and doesn't get fuzzy or pilled.My child loves it madly."
1,too small,"I actually bought this for my daughter its good quality, but i hoping it was medium sized stuffed animal but it wasnt. its really small."
2,The Worst of the Beast,"Without a doubt...the worst Maiden albumn in the collection.Lyrics border on being stupid.As bad as this record is ...Like all Maiden records good or bad...It has its Gems.But if you are thinking about buying a Maiden albumn for the first time do yourself a favor and pick up POWERSLAVE,Piece of Mind,or Somewhere in Time first."
5,What is with Everybody!!!,"Ok people whats going on here, this is great Maiden, you people who say Jannick isnt a good guitarist without great riffs need to learn how to play a guitar, cause he is bad to the bone, this album is great, all 10 tracks rock, its just more raw and wild, but is still great maiden material, Jannick Gers is just as a good guitar player as Adrian Smith if not better, he's just alot wilder, but Dave Murray is the leader of the bunch, but Maiden fans, dont waist ur time this cd rocks buy it now, true talent and high quality metal. Up the Irons!!!"
3,I still can't believe this is a Maiden album... with Bruce,"What is Holy Smoke? THe kind of song I never though Maiden can do... This albums would be good, if it wasn't from Maiden. It has good songs, like Tailgunner and Bring your daughter, but... they can't save the whole album.So, want to buy it, do it, but if this will be your first album... think it again... You should buy Powerslave or Seventh son..."
4,Why all the negative reviews?,"Bruce is at the helm, Steve and Nico are providing the power, and Dave just rocks! What more do you want? Sure this may not represent Maidens best effort but it's no slouch either. I particularly found ""Holy Smoke"" to an excellent jab at televangelists (as you may remember, the Album ""The Number of the Beast"" drew a lot of criticism from those types, as they claimed Maiden to be Satanic, god help us). Another stand out is ""Public Enema"" which harkens back to the Powerslave era (Scream ""Fall to your Knees again""). Tailgunner (Another song about air-to-air combat) is well crafted and sails smoothly. Even the silly titled ""bring your daughter to the slaughter"" is catchy, and if you can get beyond the questionable lyrics, it's a good aural romp. This entire album is pretty darn good. As a Maiden fan from way back, I can proudly give my stamp of approval."
1,ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH,"I don't give it zero star because it's Maiden who is playing. I mean, sometimes I have doubts that is Maiden playing, so boring, ludicrous and energyless is their performance in this album. THe debut of Janick Gers was something to be forgotten, but it was not his fault since he does not contribute with songs here. All the songs are loser here, a real achievment for songwriters of the calibre of Harris, Dickinson and Murray."
1,I DON'T THINK IT WAS MAIDEN WHO RECORDED THIS...,"DOn't worry, pals. Probable it wasn't Maiden who recorded this garbage, on of the worst metal albuns I've heard. Probably Steve and company were very tired and hierd some clones to do the job for them !! Thanks God Adrian Smith didn't feature in this ""thing"" ... Everything is cheap here: arguing that they were going back to their ""raw music"" tradidition, Maiden released a record without no production at all, no feelingm, where one of the songs ""Holy Smoke"", is so bad but is considered the best of the album !!!! The new guitarrist, Janick Gers, was a bad choice to replace Smith. He can't play solos, amazing ... the whole album sounds fake."
1,SAD DEBUT FOR GUITARRIST JANICK GERS ...,"After "" SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON"", guitarrist Adrian SMith left the band due to musical differences. He believed that Maiden should continue evolving their sound, but Harris thought not. So he left, and the path was open for the creation of four consecutive disgraceful albuns released by Maiden in the 90's. The band only found its way again when Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith returned in 1999. In this ""NO PRAYER"", we have lousy songs, that were seldom ( or never) performed by the band live again after the tour."
2,One of the worst Maiden albums,"What the heck happened to Maiden on this album? OK, so they lost Adrian Smith, who was a great & versatile guitarist and replaced him with Janick Gers, who is basically just a generic heavy metal guitarist, but that doesn't explain why this album is so horrible. The lyrics are pathetic and the music is just sub-standard for Maiden. To me, this album seems like it wants to go in the direction of Bruce Dickinson's first solo album (""Tattooed Millionaire"") but can't quite get there.""Tailgunner"" is a good song, but that's about it. Just pass on this one; nearly every Maiden album before and after it is a lot better (except for ""Virtual XI"", maybe)."
1,What is this?,"Iron Maiden is a great band, but this album is very very very very bad. I don't like this album one bit. This album is nothing compared to the Iron maiden album before this one. Don't buy this if you have a good taste of music, this isn't what Iron maiden sounds like, well it is, but it shouldn't be! Bruce Dickinson sings terrible on this album, he used to sing very good, but not here, he uses his voice on a strange way. AVOID THIS ALBUM ON ALL COSTS!"
4,"Very Underrated,deserves better fan support","I realize that I am in the minority when Isay that this is one of my favorite Maiden albums.I love Janick Gers's guitar playing.His solos on ""Holy Smoke"" and ""The Assassin""(my 2 favorites on it)are nothing short of unreal.Yes,Adrian Smith is sorely missed.His contribution to the maiden sound is undeniable.However their sound,although different,is no less powerful than it ever was.My only complaint(4 stars instead of 5) is that Bruce's voice clearly needed a rest.A few months off before cutting his vocal tracks would have done him a world of good.His range is not there,and he is obviously struggling to hit the notes that he does hit.There is not a bad song on this cd.Give it a chance,and keep an open mind.Yes Adrian is gone,yes the sound is different,and YES they still sound great."
3,TOO CRITICAL,"I have all the Maiden albums except those with Di Anno,and I think this album is still rather enjoyable to listen to.Cripes,Judas Priest fans still rave about their early efforts which to my mind sound distinctly amateurish and outdated compared to this.Looking at the economics;why,if at the time of my writing,is this album selling used and new here at amazon at nigh on $11 if it's so bad.Seems to me that the silent majority secretly like it and are buying it anyway.They just keep quiet about it to avoid copping any flack.If people insist on giving every song an aural autopsy instead of just being entertained they're never going to be happy."
2,OK! Stop! While You Still Own A Shred Of Dignity! Iron Maiden On The Highway To Hell,"There comes a time in any great bands existence when someone from the outside, be it a manager or a producer or just a family friend should step in and suggest that they just plain quit. Well....obviously Iron Maiden didn;t have anyone there to let them know that they had just reached the level of ridiculous. No Prayer For The Wicked is just plain crap. There is nothing here woth salvaging. Even Adrian Smith knew it was time, so he bailed out of the band, leaving the second guitar slot to Janneck Gers. Public Enema Number One? Precisely! Get a clue.Deal with it!"
2,Really bad.. Beginning of decline,"Sensing the band had gone much too far towards a ""progressive"" direction, Steve Harris decided to go back to a raw sound. Ok. Adrian Smith left the band before recording began.His replacement was one of those mysterious choices that will make you guess forever... Janick Gers. A guy who simply can't play a guitar solo with the same skill as Dave Murray, Adrian Smith or dozens of other British guitarrists (check the ""butchering"" that Janick does when playing Adrian's solos, live. Unbeliavable. He spends so much time jumping and kneeling and spinning that he simply don't play them!)Anyway, NO PRAYER has a raw sound. So far so good, but there was no necessity to use such a lousy production, with a garage sound, adn stupid songs like HOLY SMOKE and BRING YOUR DAUGHTER. There are some gems here (HOOKS IN YOU still has Adrian on the credits), and TAILGUNNER. But even the great songs were ruined by the weak production and some of them by bad soloing."
3,Its an average album -> a bad for Iron Maiden,This album has some good moments (Tailgunner - bring you daughter + some parts in some songs) The vocals are good but the problem is that its just average-> you just have a neutral feeling not so powerful like listening Seventh son or Powerslave...I believe that is exclusively for the Iron Maiden fans and only for them.
3,Not SO Bad!! Give it a listen before judging!!,"This album, while quite mediocre compared to Maidens masterpieces Number of the Beast and AMOLAD, still shines in its own right with Tailgunner, Mother Russia, the Assassin and Bring Your Daughter... being my top picks."
3,Uninspired,"I know that I will propably catch alot of heat from fellow Iron Maiden fans for saying this, but when listening through No Prayer for the Dying the words uninspired and dull comes to mind. It is like Iron Maiden lost some of their creativity and their ""energy"" on this album. There are some good songs like the title track and Run Silent, Run Deep but as a whole the album seem ""forced"" by that I mean it seems like Iron Maidens soul was not into making this album, like it was something they had to do to satisfy record companies or fans. They might succeed in pleasing the first group, but I do think they fail in making the second party happy.Bruce Dickinson left Iron Maiden after this album, and one have to wonder whether he was getting tired of ""playing it safe"" and wanted new challenges as a solo-artist.With Dickinson leaving Iron Maiden went towards sad times."
2,Ok...,"Sure, this is Iron Miaden. It has all there: the epic one (Mother Russia), the fast-paced opener (Tailgunner), the Dave Murray's compositions (Public Enemy Number One; Fates Warning, the working-song (Holy Smoke). The only trouble is: Adrian Smith is gone. This new guitar player, Jannick Gers, an acomplished musician, doesn't fit into Iron. Even if he has a lot of energy, he's not technical at all, his solos are simply not quite good enough, ugly and embarassed and noisy, no creativity at all! This CD marks the end of an era and the beginning of another which, we all know, is not better than before..."
2,Disappointing,"Iron Maiden rules but this album sux! save your self the money and if you want a good maiden album buy Piece Of Mind or Powerslave. the only good song on here is Bring Your Daughter To the Slaughter the rest of the album is very disappointing, you would expect more from Iron Maiden. buy there older stuff its much better"
2,THE BEGINING OF THE END...,"Weak, very weak. When Adrian quit, Steve should have ""hung 'em up""!! From '80-'88, Maiden were simply the best band in the world!! But this album is horrible; there are only 2 decent songs (Mother Russia & No Prayer!! Do not waste your money....buy any of their earlier releases!!"
2,"With Adrian Smith gone, this album marks their decline","With Janick Gers replacing the irreplaceable Adrian Smith, this album marks the beginning of the end of the best metal band of all time. There are a couple of good songs, but the distinctive and timeless instrumental sound of Iron Maiden is gone. The melodic chemistry between Adrian Smith and Dave Murray has been replaced by a rather obnoxious sounding guitarist (Gers) who seemingly plays just to make noise. Gers style of playing will leave hard-core Maiden fans disappointed. The quality of songs does not live up the standard Iron Maiden has set with previous albums. Iron Maiden and Gers do not mix well for my tastes. The departure of Smith marks a sad day for us all."
1,"They used to call these: ""Gods Of British Metal...""","Weak, poor, sad and unbelievably bad. From now on, all the Maiden cd's should be rated 1 or 2 except for Virtual XI and X-Factors that should be rated 3 and rarely 4 thanks to mr. Blaze Bayley"
2,No prayer for an album,"The worst Iron Maiden album in my opinion but there are a few fantastic tracks amongst the anguish. Tailgunner, Prayer, Run Silent., Mother Russia are all very good but the band lost its focus after the huge tours for all those years. Adrian had left and Bruce would also leave after Fear of the Dark. Still its a must to own for those tracks I mentioned above but clearly the guys were not entirely focused on this album."
2,just as bad as fear of the dark,"What a letdown this album is! I remember when this album came out, I was in high school, and I bought this at the mall. Got out to my car, put the tape in, and listened to Tailgunner. It was ok, but only ok. I could sense that the whole album was going to be weak, and I was right. I was so depressed. I was thinking that it was Fear of the Dark when I wrote a review for that one but it was this one. What a downer. Tailgunner and maybe the second song are mediocre. The rest are terrible. Tailgunner is a second-rate Aces High recap with only about 20% of the adrenaline. Don't buy this album if you like Maiden. I can't believe that people gave this 4 and 5 stars. They are confused."
2,NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING,TAILGUNNER-6/10HOLY SMOKE-6/10NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING-7/10PUBLIC ENEMA NUMBER ONE-5/10FATES WARNING-6/10RUN SILENT RUN DEEP-5/10HOOKS IN YOU-5/10BRING YOUR DAUGHTER... TO THE SLAUGHTER-6/10MOTHER RUSSIA-6/10
2,Not up to Maiden standards,"In a word, awful. This CD contains three decent hit singles in ""Holy Smoke"", ""Tailgunner"" and ""Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter"" and another catchy tune in the aptly-named ""Hooks In You"". Stupid and derivative lyrics and substandard musicianship aside (not that they play them bad, but these are songs where a band like Maiden can just ""phone it in""), all are good enough to make you hum along with repeated listens. Too bad they're surrounded by turkeys like ""Mother Russia"", ""Fates Warning"", ""Public Enema Number One"", ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""The Assassin"". The title track is acceptable, although it's basically the blueprint for ""Afriad To Shoot Strangers"" on the following album (and ""Strangers"" is better). And what's up with Bruce Dickenson's voice? He sounds like he's been gargling battery acid and chain smoking unfiltered pieces of tire rubber. I would call this the weakest album they've ever done."
4,What is wrong with you guys?,"Why do all you guys think this album is so bad??? I love the songs ""Tail Gunner"", ""Holy Smoke"", ""The Assassin"", and ""Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter"". Come on, I don't see what is so bad about this cd. The rest of the songs are good, and I have listened to the CD maybe 20 times in the past 2 days without tiring of it. It's great."
3,"IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS ONE...","If you are a true Iron Maiden fan, you will realize that the recordings of Killers, Number of the Beast and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son are days gone by. Sure you can enjoy them but support the albums and change with them. No Prayer offers the listener some very great songs (Tailguner, Hooks In You, and Bring Your Daughter..), some average ones (Mother Russia and Holy Smoke) and a few disappointmens. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER CAUSE THIS IS IRON MAIDEN. If you cant support the best metal band EVER, then you are not a true hard-core fan. Go somewhere else and when their next epic CD comes out and it is fantastic, will you jump back on the band-wagon or will you be there like the rest of us are? No Prayer For The Dying is a good collection of songs that should be decided on an idividual basis...."
3,No prayer,"I was 10 when this album came out, my brother and I put the c.d. on, we thought, wow, what a good rocker album. As i grew older, i realised what a difference in sound from SSOASS to no prayer. In fact, i heard that the change in sound was the reason (or at least one of) that adrian smith (guitarist----for non fans) had left the band. I guess that is my greatest complaint with this album. the sound is not good at all. with SSOASS, maiden hit their peak with that beautiful sound and on this album, first song we see is holy smoke. ok song but the sound sounds real sloppy. I do like quite a few songs on this album and i still don't understand why maiden refuse to play some songs from this album. give it a chance, it is definately not ssoass part 2. sound is different and writing is different too but it is a solid rocker album"
3,A Great Albumn,This albumn is not one of Iron Maiden's best; but it is definetly worth owning. The songs are still being played by the masters of metal; it can't be all bad. Mother Russia is a great song. Iron Maiden still rocks! Up The Irons!
2,It's underrated because it's their worst album,"Ok, back to bascis may have seen a good idea by Steve Harris. But writing just a bunhc of useless and incredibly bad metal songs (by Maiden standards, I mean) was a strange move. This album is lefeless, no doubt it suffered from the moment the band was going through (Adrian Smith leaving). It's a mysery to me how Martin Birch (the producer) did not warn the big boss Steve Harris that the album suck..d.If you are a Maiden die hard, you will find all their albums a work of art. But if other than that, almost everybody recognizes this to be the worst effort of the Dickinson albums."
2,"Ahhh, Just think about the irony....","This album, one of Bruce-Maiden's worst, shows again that bands should make sure the material in the album is good before putting words like die or dying in the title. Another istance is ""Never Say Die"" by Black Sabbath, which was the last album with the legendary original lineup.Although Iron Maiden did go on to record one more album with Bruce Dickinson (""Fear of the Dark"" which is a little better than this one) this was the beginning of the end. However, it still doesn't prevent the Maidens from cementing themselves as one of the top bands in metal history."
1,maiden's career low,"this is there worst album. all the songs sound like they were rushed through, like they didn't think about the material, they just did it. adrian agreed that they didn't work on songs enough. he was right.jannick gers can't hold a candle to adrian smith.""holy smoke"" is a lame attempt to trash evangelists. in 1990 that topic was an old hat. slayer did that 2 years ago with the far superior ""read between the lies"", as well as countless other bands.""mother russia"" is steve's worst epic ever. it sounds like like they just didn't care anymore. they pulled out of this slump after that.fear of the dark was alot better than this crap. lets hope that maiden don't ever sink this far again"
2,A disappointment,"When this album came out it hammered the final nails into the coffin of the NWOBHM. It simply could not stand up to the massive albums coming out at the time from American bands like Slayer and Megadeth. After releasing two albums with a decidedly bloated euro-metal sound (keyboards and guitar synth), this album meant to hail a return to Maiden's denim and leather days of yore. But without the wailing emo solos of Adrian Smith, and the addition of Janick Gers (who is a great guitar player in his own right, but couldn't manage to break out of blazing through boring bluesy runs) Maiden churned out a bland slab of vinyl. As much as I loved Maiden in the day, they failed their American audience at a crucial point when speed metal was all too happy to step in and take the heavy metal crown."
4,"Come on, it ain't that bad!!!","This may not be the greatest Maiden album ever, but it is an average representation of their sound. They do have Bruce on this album, and that is one of its many saving graces. Although some of the songwriting may pale in comparison to that of other Maiden albums, remember that it is better than anything they ever did with Blaze Bayley (I heard one song they did with him, and that was enough for me!!) and that it still is an enjoyable listen although not quite on the same level as such magna opi as Piece of Mind, Somewhere in Time or Brave New World. Although it may and has alienated some hardcore fans, The bulk of the album may send the unconverted or casual Maiden fans into rapture, particularly ""Bring Your Daughter......To The Slaughter"" and ""Holy Smoke."""
2,BEGINNING OF THE END,"Someone said below this CD is a ""Must HAve"". Há ! THis is the first CD after the magical ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Son"" and the departure of guitarrist Adrian Smith. The result? Raw music, which is good, but without any vibration or inspiration. See the work-tittle of the alum ""Holy Smoke"": nothing in it. ""MOther Russia"" was a failed attempt to reproduce ""To Tame a Land"", ""Rime of the Ancient MAriner"" and others Harris'epics. Not good at all!"
2,Iron Maiden Can't be Stopped - but this album flopped,"I was the BIGGEST Iron Maiden fan growing up. From age 10, when I got ""Powerslave"" for Christmas, to age 20, when I saw IM live for the 2nd time in Salt Lake City supporting No Prayer for the Dying, they were my pet band. After that concert, the songs on this album grew old fast, whereas songs on their first 5 albums have never grown stale to this day. I love Iron Maiden, but this album was the beginning of the end of their flowering as the world's preeminent rock band."
3,they made a mistake and admit it.,The songs here are good but the production value is not so good. They stripped down the sound here and even bruce dickenson sings raspy. This change in vocals was interpeted by many to mean that he COULDN'T sing the way he used to. They recorded this in a barn even. IT was a huge mistake sonically but the songs if recorded in their usual style would have been better recieved for sure. The band took a huge hit with this one as they dropped the synths and then sounded like alot of other bands out there. It was a real fall for them and they don't even play any songs from this one in concert. So it's probably near the bottom of their catalog with bruce dickenson. The production was the problem and the whole raspy voice thing really was too much of a problem for many fans to deal with. I enjoyed this one but lets be frank it's not up to their standards only because of the production style and vocal presentation.
2,Worst With Bruce.,"I wanted to like it but I still didn't. Lyrics, instruments, vocals are all bad. Fear of the Dark is when they shows potential again and it's a decent album, way better than No Prayer for the Dying. Adrian leaving the band was probably part of the reason why they went downhill. The '90s was a bad time for Iron Maiden and it would take until Brave New World for them to recover all the way. Even legends like Iron Maiden have made mistakes in their career. No Prayer For The Dying is by far, their worst with Bruce and the 2nd worst only to Virtual XI. However I've grown to like a few tracks like Tailgunner, The Assassin and Run Silent Run Deep but the rest is forgettable. It's a bad album overall but not horrible."
3,"3 hits, 7 misses","Because of ""Tailgunner"", ""Run Silent Run Deep"" and ""Mother Russia"", this CD is worth buying if you can find it Used or in the bargain bin. These are 3 very good songs that are underrated because they happen to be on a very subpar album. The production on this album is also very good. Unfortunately the rest of the songs on here are a waste of time. They range from boring to purposely stupid (""Holy Smoke""? ). Program tracks 1, 7 & 10 and then go listen to a better Maiden CD like ""Somewhere in Time""!"
4,NPFTD,"When this album came out it was on the heels of 7th Son. I guess I was just thrown by the overall rawness of the album and the absence of Adrian. All in all it didn't really wow me, but I hardly thought it sucked. I also admit that this was one Maiden album that I didn't listen to as frequently as the others. I recently listened to it again. There were a slew of more progressive sounding Maiden releases from X Factor on (that were all great by the way) after No Prayer. Listening to this CD now is a different experience. It's kinda like it aged a bit like fine wine and now as I rediscover it, I find the songs are pretty good, albeit raw. No problem with that. I'm glad Bruce and Adrian took a little vacation from the band after FOTD because when they came back the material that Maiden put out was simply incredible."
4,"An OK album compared to their best ones, but has a couple of maiden's finest songs","Just because maiden didn't make a record as some fans wanted doesn't make it a bad album. Maiden plays raw, and this one is raw, ofcourse, somewhere in time and seventh son are masterpieces, but NPFTD is a good jump back to the basics, the roots.... I'm a maiden fan, this one falls short compared to ""Somewhere.."", but only by a bit, with the exception of ""the assassin"", this album is good...really good stuff"
2,Give it a chance!,"""No Prayer for the dying"", what can I say about it?, well, for me is a regular album, of course, it ins't as good as ""Powerslave"" or ""Fear of the Dark"", but it's a Maiden CD anyway, ""Tailgunner"" and ""Bring your daughter to the slaughter"" are good songs, so, if you're a true fan this album can't miss in your collection!"
5,Unfairly disregarded album!,"Why this album is considered to be bad?Well,may be only after comparison with the other ones.OK, but just listen to it once again without maiking this comparison.I think the album itself is very good - it has its highlights: ""Holy smoke"", ""Assassin"" and ""Bring your daughter to the slaughter"" are songs which differ so much and create so different mood. Bruce's voice is so cruel, guitars are uncomparably rough.In which of the other Maiden albums you could see that?"
5,As much fun to browse through as it is to cook from,"Some of America's most unique and talented cooks serve in humble roadside cafes and friendly neighborhood eateries. Jane and Michael Stern have gone ""on the road"" to encounter and retrieve outstanding recipes from the culinary heartland of American ""blue plate specials"" and showcased them in Blue Plate Specials & Blue Ribbon Chefs: The Heart And Soul Of America's Great Roadside Restaurants.

Blue Plate Specials & Blue Ribbon Chefs is a wonderful addition to any personal or professional cookbook collection."
2,a very forgettable film,"I was duly unimpressed with this video...I guess I expected too much. The action just dragged on and on. The acting was one-dimensional, as illustrated by Kevin Space's robot. The special effects appeared amateurish at best. All in all, a very forgettable video."
3,Slow paced - Reviews are way overrating this,"This movie is very different than your average science fiction films. It relies much less on FX and concentrates on the drama instead. The problem is that the cast size is extremely limited which makes for a very slow story line at times. You're basically dealing with one guy alone on the moon. Kind of like Castaway in space, but with a twist thrown in.The story starts with the main character counting down the days to go home. He's been alone on the Moon for nearly three years with nothing but the AI system for company and now he's desperate to get back home. But as the minutes tick down he discovers there were some things about his assignment they didn't tell him. And so it goes, you find out a little bit at a time what the back-story to his assignment actually was.The story had potential. It's offbeat and somewhat original, yet even so I found it a very slow ride. In short, it's just not that memorable."
5,Lyrical,"What a strange and beautiful movie. I really enjoyed this movie. This movie is not for a non-thinker. This movie will confuse and annoy some, but for others it will be a real treat. I was over-joyed by the end of this movie which is touching but not in a mainstream way. The movie played out like a symphony of gorgeous music. I would recomend this movie to anyone with a brain and a heart."
3,Don't see what the fuss was about,"This movie had great reviews on many websites but it was just kinda slow and dull for me. Not horrible as I did watch it all the way through, but not great either."
4,Moon DVD,"I think Sam Rockwell is an excellent actor. Not only is he about the only actor in this movie, he carries off multiple roles.I don't recommend knowing anything about this movie in advance -- especially don't watch the trailer! It gives away too much in what is a movie with many twists and should actually keep you guessing. It is fairly predictable if you watch the trailer, but, Rockwell's fine acting carries the movie. Kevin Spacey has a voice only part in the movie.As you watch the movie -- and again, Rockwell's multiple roles -- you will forget that you are watching the performance of only ONE actor. It's very easy to forget as he plays them so well. Many may disagree, but I felt this performance was at least Academy Awards nomination worthy. I believe Sam Rockwell is one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood.The DVD has some fine extras that enhances the movie experience overall, but don't watch them first."
5,VERY intense well developed plot,"This is a great movie, a lot of realistic emotion and very good acting, I haven't seen a movie this good sinceThe Thirteenth Floor."
4,Absolutely Fabulous (for sci-fi),"Let me first say that I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi.I enjoyed Star Wars (when I was a kid), I enjoyed X-Files a bit, but for the most part it's just not my thing. That said, this is an amazing film. It's a slow paced thriller that is intelligently written and filmed. It truly doesn't even really come across as a sci-fi, yet fans of the genre will greatly appreciate it. It's beautiful to look at and has somewhat of a timeless quality about it. I almost saw this in the theater and now I wish I had. Truly amazing!The DVD package could have been better, but it does include a short film titled ""Whistle"" which also ""blew"" me away... a very good extra on the DVD.Whistle alone is worth the price of the disc. And Moon? One of the best movies I've seen across all genres and my favorite sci-fi yet. Do NOT miss this one!!!!!"
3,Feedback on film but more importantly the poor streaming process,The film dragged at times. The only problem I had was with the downloading. My internet service was fine but your downloading process was terrible. I watched a Netflix movie right after yours and had no downloading problems and yet when I went back to your service it caused at least 30 delays during the duration of your film Moon.
3,not a bad movie,This movie lacks a bit. It's a little on the dull side and I don't think lived up to what it was meant to be
5,100% recommended,"If you took Harlan Ellison, Arthur C. Clarke, and Stanislaw Lem, put them in a room, made them watch ""2001"" and ""Sniper 470"" (just to set the tone), then gave them a single typewriter and said, ""OK, guys, come up with something..."" ""Moon"" could be that movie. Yeah, it's THAT good.I like movies that don't mistake ""great special effects"" for ""great science fiction."" This movie went straight to the top of my all-time-favorites list. Thoughty, speculative, and original."
5,Great movie!,"This is one of my favorite movies! Produced with a budget of just $50million (which is not a lot in the film world), the makers of Moon have delivered an excellent sic-fi piece that rivals the much bigger budget productions."
4,Unique and original idea.,It's nice to see a movie with a new idea and acted well. Huge fan of the movie and have been recommending to friends since I watched it.
2,Hallucinations Not Entertaining,"For much of the movie the main character is hallucinating, which isn't particularly interesting to watch, more like a waste of time. In the end there were some interesting plot twists but not enough for me to recommend."
3,"It was okay, not great.","It was a little on the boring side. This movie is a one time see and if you can, rent it or netflix. All movie long there was really just one person playing the role, kind of like I AM LEGEND. I'd probably never have any interest in seeing this movie again."
2,"This movie should be sent to the MOON, or where ever !!!","First off before I get all the backlash from all the people who loved this movie, I didn't hate this, but realy don't get all the hype on it? In general, the movie I thought, was kind of boring, with an ending that brought little to the table. To be honest, even the ladies at hollywood video had said what a great movie this was besides all the great reviews on amazon. I already knew the movie had a slow beginning and would move along slow, so I sat there watching and waiting to see towards the ending how this thing would play out. Well not to spoil anything but just to say I was realy expecting more. There was no real suspense there. Only because of the good reviews did I purchase the movie, but I found it only mildly entertaining. I gave this 2 stars only because it didn't live up to the hype."
2,Eh.,"I love Sam Rockwell, and I was sure that I'd love the movie based on the reviews and the trailer...I didn't. This movie has an excellent idea, but though Sam Rockwell is a fantastic actor, he wasn't electrifying to watch. His performance was genuine and incredible, but boring. There would be periods when it would feel like the movie would pick up and take me somewhere exciting, but then it wouldn't deliver. I wasn't looking for Michael Bay 'splosions and Roland Emerich-level apocalypses, but this seemed more like a novel playing out on screen than a movie. A novel that didn't translate well to images.Moon has a lot of potential. A really fantastic idea, an interesting group of actors, an interesting ending and a thoroughly developed lead character are all things that the movie has going for it. The movie just failed to deliver on all of its promise. It could have been so much more than it was... but it just wasn't."
5,Instant classic,"Beautiful film. Wonderfully shot, haunting score. I'm particularly pleased with the use of practical effects, bringing a slightly more real tone to the scenes. Rockwell does a marvelous job portraying his character's multifaceted idiosyncrasies With equal parts stoic precision and comedic timing. It's not easy interacting with another you. Spacey as the charming and thoughtful robot voice was amusing. One of several nods to classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Silent Running.Not your typical epic blockbuster film by today's standards but I prefer this. It's an intelligent and interesting look at the human condition and morality with humor elements. Absolutely stunning jn blu-ray. A worthy addition to any scifi buff's library."
5,Amazed!!,"Such a well made movie with a low budget. Not your typical ""Michael bay"" explosions sci-fi type of movie. I heard good things about it and decided to buy it. Well worth owning."
4,An Interesting Movie with a Twist,"I had been curious about this movie for awhile and was glad to have the opportunity to watch it.The key to the movie is Sam Rockwell who is effective and convincing as Sam Bell who is the only Moon based employee of a large corporation with a mining operation on the moon. Sam's ""companion"" a computer named Gerty reminds one of ""2001 A Space Odyssey;"" there is a major point of deviation in the ending with Gerty responding very differently from the HAL computer during the climax of the story.The story starts as Sam is nearing completion of a three year contract and is more than ready to go home and see his wife and little girl. The suspense begins to build very nicely when it appears he's not alone on the Moon and then hints begin to be dropped as to what might be actually going on and finally suspicions are confirmed by the end of the movie.If you are a science fiction fan I think you will definitely enjoy it; I found it interesting and worth the time."
3,Very good,"A good film, well-conceived and well-acted. Maybe not the best science fiction ever, but worth watching."
2,far side,"A bleak film whose idea gets away from it. By the end you're pretty well tired of throwing up, bloody vomit, foul language, all of which overwhelms the story. S.F. this is not. Essentially boring."
2,Not worth it,"I found the movie to be a ""cult"" wanna-be production. Predictable ending. A little boring."
2,So dumb.,"So I was skeptical about paying $10 just to watch this film, once it began I was pretty excited seeing that the music was done by Clint Mansell and imagining a man going insane from isolation and being cut off from the nourishment of the planet Earth. However, it turned into a ridiculous story about clones. Wow exciting and creative - not."
1,So cheesy I could almost smell it....,I waited 10 light years for Sam Rockwell to be smacked in the head by Gerty.Enough said.
2,No gravity,"""Moon"" is light instead of dark, safe rather than adventurous, and more tedious than watching ""Solaris"" for the fifth time. I'm gonna take a shot in the dark here and guess that Duncan Jones (the former Zowie Bowie[!]) digs Stanley Kubrick. There's certainly nothing wrong with that -- until you make a movie that mistakes pale imitation for homage. Ground control to major Tom: your circuit's dead, there's something wrong...."
1,Flabbergasted,"I seriously can't believe the reviews I'm reading here. I never walk out of a movie, but when I saw Moon in the theater I came closer than I ever have before. The plot is tedious and predictable, with several aspects that make absolutely no sense and are never even attempted to be explained (ghostly lady walking around on the surface of the moon?) Also, I understand that this was an independent film, but the production values and set pieces are laughable. This movie is so bad that I actually told people to go see it as a practical joke. Anyone with a sense of what makes good sci-fi, or a good story in general, will have nothing but contempt for this steaming pile of excrement on celluloid (or blu-ray, in this case)."
4,Moon - A Nice Surprise,"I really enjoyed this film a lot. I was worried that it was just going to be a re-working of the 70's film ""Silent Running"", but after the first 15 minutes or so you realize that this is a very different story. Sam Rockwell is great in the film as he pretty much has to carry the whole thing. As others have mentioned there are a few plot problems, the main one being why someone would be stationed all alone in a situation like this in the first place. Overall though I did not have too many issues with these things for the most part. I won't give any of the plot away, but if you like thoughtful science fiction that is not an action picture I would think you would like this."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Sam Rockwell gives an Oscar worthy performance in an otherwise dark and mediocre film. I can see what the director was aiming for, but he missed the mark big time. The story was decent enough, but the movie was very slow and extremely predictable. The performance of Rockwell, was his best performance to date, however it was wasted on what i thought was a pretty dull movie."
2,cabinetmaker,THIS BOOK IS VERY HARD TO REMEMBER THE CHARACTER'S NAMES. THE AUTHOR'S WRITING IS EASY TO READ AND HAS A SIMPLE KIND OF WRITING.
5,Great costume,Relatively affordable for a very cute costume. I actually got this costume and had one of my friends dress up for my daughter's birthday party. She loved Cinderella!
5,Categorize their music if you can!,"As always, Goose Creek shows on this album that they are not afraid to do musically what they feel inside. Rock, Country, Bluegrass....they feel it all, and they do it all well. I have been a Goosehead since the early 70's and look forward to each new release. Their style is not dictated to them by popular trends, but rather is a reflection of their inner souls. I was so glad to see this album among their other early works re-released on CD. LONG LIVE GOOSE CREEK."
3,Good little intro to the Pixies,"If you've never bought anything by the pixies, this would be a good mini-sampler that draws from Doolittle and Surfer Rosa. If are a fan of the pixies and own those two albums, this import single is going to be a waste of your money."
1,Couldn't get interested in this one to save my life,"Revolted robots, okay. Old hippies have taken over Florida, great. A government that's given Florida to said old hippies, still pretty funny. An old boozer genius, still good. Sta Hi, what a hoot. Immortality and nosy cops too, fabulous. Mix all of these elements together and all this promise gets tangled up in the cords and falls flat. Maybe if I'd been able to force myself to finish it, I'd have a different opinion, but I couldn't get that far."
4,Excellent cyberpunk,"Wonderful book, a must read for cyberpunk fans (along with wetware and freeware). He takes you to the brink of total chaos but manages to hold it all together."
2,It was... Ok?,"I couldn't tell if I liked the book while I was reading it, so I decided to finish it. I'm still not sure. I think the only reason I liked it at all, was because I wanted to. It's a topic I like, but it didn't really deliver. With all the books out there, and only so much time to live, I am -sure- there are better to choose from."
4,Trophy Hunter,"This book is a specialized resource for big game hunters who want to prepare to hunt Mule Deer. The book provides a good overview of deer hunting strategy and tactics, and excellent information about Mule Deer behavior and habitat. Prothero's discussion of hunting tactics, particularly tracking, are also right on the mark, but the reading gets a bit tiresome as the author provides many examples that always seem to end with a huge running buck being brought down by a heroic shot. If you can handle the chest thumping, it's a good read."
2,No spill while you are shaking the drink.. But..,it is really hard to detach the cap or top part from the body. You need to have a hammer to detach them. Not recommend to buy this.Is there any easy way to detach this kind of cocktail shaker?
3,"Nice Premise, Handled Wrongly!","This one is passable entertainment if you don't pay much attention to the plot and enjoy what few things this film has to offer. Among them is Richard Gere's charismatic performance as Ex-IRA who is now helping Sidney Poitier track down The Jackal. Poitier is his usual intimidating self and it's a lot of fun to see Bruce Willis change identities, I also enjoyed the high-tech weaponry. Other than that, the plot and the ending are unsatisfying. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!"
1,The only thing sinister is the script.,Wow. Bruce Willis kisses a man and Richard Gere tries to be Irish. All the while a nutty FBI agent played by Sidney Poitier uses his Russian sidekick to protect the First Lady. The movie is a two hour bore. The characters are not developed and the story goes from nothing to less than that. Please do not waste your money.
3,A little too stubborn and misplaced professionalism,"I didn't like Sydney Poitier in that movie. He was too distant.Bruce Willis was good, though, but still, don't have to do much to be that kind of character...Plot was good. A few very good violent scenes. That's about it for that movie."
3,"Very nice movie, beware of the subtitles","I wanted to have this movie and I waited for the blu ray release.If you are interested in the spanish/español subtitles/subtitulos, beware that this particular edition has both DVD and blu ray discs, both only the DVD has the above mentioned. The blu ray disc only has English SDH subtitles"
3,Good cast but a mediocre thriller,"This high-tech thriller isn't as bad as some and has an all-star cast but a farfetched plot and a meandering story rob the picture of any credibility. A Russian mob figure is killed and his brother recruits an international contract killer to avenge his death. An IRA terrorist is then recruited by the FBI to hunt down the hit man who uses computer-generated weapons which would make it almost impossible for an assassin to travel in stealth and without notice. Stars Bruce Willis, Richard Gere and Sidney Poitier would light up any theater marquee but the film runs out of steam well before the finish. There is no comparison with this movie to the excellent 1973 Fred Zinnemann classic, ""The Day of the Jackal""."
2,"It tries, and in the end it fails","The only good things about this movie are Bruce Willis, Sydney Poitier, and Jack Black. And that's about it; the rest of the movie is anything but special. It's an almost worthless movie if it weren't for the three actors mentioned above. The plot had some interesting elements, but what ruins the film are pretty much everything else. Richard Gere, especially, turns out to be quite annoying and incredibly dull. The chemistry between him and Diane Verona's character didn't work at all. I almost felt like I skipping their scenes and focusing only on Willis.The good editing, music, and cinematography turn out to be a waste in The Jackal. I should have watched the original 1973 film instead."
3,Gere and Willis Make It Worth Seeing,"This movie is loosely based on DAY OF THE JACKAL with Edward Fox as the jackal and Tony Britton as the French detective trying to stop him before he can act. To those who have seen the original, this is a terrible remake.To those who have not seen DAY OF THE JACKAL, Bruce Willis makes all of his roles interesting as the killer. Richard Gere plays the role of the detective, but in the movie he is a... wait for it--""Irish Republican Army"" terrorist brought out of jail to find the Jackal. I kid you not--an IRA terrorist. We have seen Richard Gere play Sir Lancelot in FIRST KNIGHT with a Brooklyn accent. Now you get to see him as an Irishman with a Brooklyn accent.Blame whoever came up with this ridiculous idea for Gere's character, because the IRA has nothing to do with the plot. The character could just as well have been a former hit man from Brooklyn. Getting past that for the moment, if you knew nothing about the original movie, it is a reasonably good thriller."
2,Let the classics live and leave aside the remakes; would you?,"This remake of the classic Forsyhte's best seller, was directed by the hypertalented Fred Zinemmann. I should admit the first half of this remake really captured the full attention of the audience.Bruce Willis made his second best acting after ""Twelve monkeys"", despite of the fact he doesn't get to acquire the gelid expression of Edward Fox, he gets to involve the spectator.The problem with the film resides in the unnecesary amount of secondary roles, with Sydney Poitier looking extremely uncomfortable with the role, with Richard Gere whose baby face makes incredible his role as an Irish terrorist and the presence of a Russian agent makes the movie had fallen into a very entangled web of dramatic lines whose final resolution affects the primary plot."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"Dear God, what a bad movie. Based very loosely on Frederick Forsyth's book, THE DAY OF THE JACKEL, this travesty is filled with ridiculous plot devices, bad acting, cardboard characters, and a ""professional killer"" who is anything but professional. See the original 1973 movie starring Edward Fox for a real film. This version is saved from one star here only because of Sidney Poitier. A waste of time and money."
1,a cheap imitation of a beautiful original,"Even with nothing better to do this film was a total waste of time. It hurt's to watch each and every moment of this movie-- especially if one compares this cheap imitation, with its overblown, and overbombed scenes to the original Day of the Jackal. By the last scene it left me calling for the blow up of the first lady to bring some interest to the movie."
2,Major weak point!,"I heard so much about this movie but when I started watching it, I felt disappointed.At first, everything goes well... if you like spy movies! Yes, you can swallow it. But what I really didn't swallow was that Richard Gere (IRA) can always guess & predict what Bruce Willis (spy) is going to do next!I mean come on, an IRA knows, predicts and does everything as if he can read Bruce's mind! This was stupid hole in the movie that I couldn't swallow or accept... so the movie gets down rated!Yes, great actors names but awful movie!"
2,a pale imitation,"standard far-fetched action flic - Richard Gere so-so, Bruce Willis completely mis-cast, only bright light was Diane Venora as hard-nosed former KGB agent - anyone who thinks this is as good as the original ""Day of the Jackal"" is a moron"
2,Very poor remake of a classic,"I missed ""The Jackal"" when it was released, but the promo's all said it was a modern remake of the classic ""Day of the Jackal"". Forget it! Not only is this a bad remake, it's so boring I trashed it halfway thru and never want to see it again. Put your time and money into the original ""Day of the Jackal"" and see what a great movie-maker like Fred Zinneman and company can do with a story like this."
1,Please stop the remakes,"$70 million to whack out the head of the FBI? The Russian gangsters in this clinker obviously don't shop around for hired killers. As if hearing Gere's Irish accent isn't bad enough, we must bear two hours of Bruce Willis' deadpan wig-changing killer. Argh! And why won't a rifle, a bomb, poison, something a BIT simpler be employed as the murder weapon? What's with that gun? This film is ridiculous, period."
3,Better than the original,This is an exciting movie and it is fun to watch Bruce Willis change so much. I own this and it's not great but it is really good. I reccommend this.
4,Surprising performances in a shallow plot,"Watch this one for Diane Venora's performance as a KGB agent. She makes up for the tedium of the climax, and even for the inadequate use of the statesmanlike but oh-so-approachable Sidney Poitier. Willis and Gere are a complete bore, but the writers do keep you guessing on who the assassin's target really is. One other noteworthy aspect of the film is a gut-wrenching scene with the Jackal and a techno-geek at an impromptu weapons testing range. Just put the popcorn aside after the previews."
4,German import -- main movie plays fine on US players,"I imported this version from Amazon.de some time ago and can say it plays fine on Region A (US & Canada) players. While the main movie plays fine (and looks and sounds great given the age of the movie), don't expect the extras work on your US player (as they are not encoded in 1080p)."
2,"Good build-up, Bad let-down!","The first half of the movie builds up a great story. The Jackal is a hired assassin who is paid millions of dollars to assassinate a well-known personality in the USA. He is able to go undetected all over North America using aliases, disguises and stolen identities. He has a carefully crafted plan that involves an automatic firing weapon controlled remotely via a laptop. Bruce Willis plays a very believable villain.However, the ending was so bad that the whole plot blows up like a poorly made B-movie! Unfortunately, it makes the two hours not worth watching!"
1,Zip this one back up.,"Dont you just HATE it when the good-guy just ""knows"" everything!? The one star is for the nifty cannon. Dont waste your time."
2,A substandard remake,"Other than the opening credit sequence and Carter Burwell's score, there is little to recommend this ill-advised effort. Compared to the spare elegance of Fred Zinnemann's original, this film is yet another instance of Hollywood's addiction to overblown crap. It is small wonder that Zinnemann tried to prevent any reference to his movie by this inferior film.Where to begin? Willis's use of a gigantic gun that is remote controlled rather than a weapon that was concealed within a crutch in the original movie. A wildly miscast Jack Black. The testing of a gun that blows up a van sending a gigantic fireball into the sky; how inconspicuous. Willis buying a yacht to cross the longest undefended border in the world. And since when has the FBI had jurisdiction in Russia?It just goes on and on. Watch the opening credits and then shut off the machine."
4,no where as good as the origanal but still fun if you let it,"bruce willis and richard gere plus sidney poitior in the story of an hit-man out to kill someone in the u.s. and we don't know who. russiaian mob men are looking for payback after u.s. and russian police kill one of the mobs boys in russia. they hire the ""jackel"" a hit-man who no one has ever seen and ask him to do the job. willis is the killer and he looks mean and enjoys killing. gere is an i.r.a. killer in jail who also has seen the ""jackel"" and poitior is the f.b.i. man that is tracking the hit-man down. logic never gets in the way of the action as this movie pulls out all the stops to tell this story. i makes no sence at all but it is fun if you let it be. willis is ok , gere's accent slips as much as his acting and poitior is his fine acting self and he never lets his age keep him out of the action . not great but fun ."
2,Use Once & Destroy,"Not too good, not too bad, ""The Jackal"" is one of those average action movies that brings nothing new but it`s a competent and mildly pleasant product nonetheless. The plot is derivative and predictable, the characters are bland, yet director Michael Caton-Jones chooses some decent actors (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), a neat soundtrack (Massive Attack, Primal Scream, Moby) and some decent action sequences that manage to deliver a minimum level of entertainment value. As far as popcorn movies go, there`s certainly worse, so this is a fair choice to spend a couple of mind-numbing hours.Watchable but forgettable."
2,Save Your Time,"Modern society is impatient and lacks the mental ability to appreciate many fine things. If you do not fit into MTV society, don't waste your time and see the original. Yes, the original is slower. But it is smarter. You don't have some stupid only some guy in prison knows the guy. Let's rip off the Rock a little more. Richard Gere's character was superfluous. The greatness of the original was that it was a cat and mouse, tense movie. This movie is fair at best. I wouldn't waste your time with this. There are much better, less trite, less predictable movies being made today."
2,No oscar nominations? What a surprise.,"An entertaining movie with a no brainer plot. Bruce Willis actually portrayed his character well but I couldn't get by the terrible Irish accent by Richard Gerbil whoops I mean Richard Gere. I would reccommend the movie to be rented but not bought, unless you're like me and you just like the site of your collection getting bigger. In that case, buy the Dolby Digital version and save some dough. There really isn't a whole lot to take advantage of the DTS capabilities here."
2,"Forget this, get ""The Assignment""","This was released the same year as ""The Assignment"". Shame, because it probably stole some of that movie's thunder due to the ""names"" in this [although the cast of the Assignment isn't exactly shabby].Simply put, this is mildly entertaining in the action genre, 'The Assignment' is top notch. Don't disappoint yourself, rent 'The Assignment' instead...."
2,Done much better in 1972,"I was not present at the deliberations of the committee that manufactured this movie. But I think their decisions were guided by two principles: eschew originality and embrace cliche. And they held to these principles with an admirable consistency, even at the expense of entertainment and coherence. If you like drama, tension, and intelligence more than you like armor-piercing incendiary ordnance and computer technology, then see 1972's Day of the Jackal. It is still entertaining after all these years."
4,A Rather Intense Thriller,"Bruce Willis as a bad guy? Yuppers! Bruce drops his, ""Die Hard"" hero hat and becomes a totally cold-hearted hitman known as, ""The Jackal"". Bruce is a really creepy, cunning assassin that few people have ever seen and live to tell about it. Richard Gere, playing an former IRA terrorist who is now in prison, is one of those rare people who can recognize the Jackal. He cuts a deal with the FBI to help find the Jackal before he kills an important, unknown ( so far ) target. Jack Black also stars as a techno-geek with great weapon building skills who meets a rather grisly end at the Jackal's hands. This movie had me guessing continuously as to who was the Jackal's target, ( I was way off when I found out ) and the action and suspense had me hooked. I enjoyed it very much."
3,Does contain a directors commentary.,"For anyone who is interested, this DVD (ISBN 0-7832-2688-8) does contain a commentary by director Michael Caton-Jones. Why Universal doesn't put that information on the box is beyond me. They've done it before(12 Monkeys springs to mind); have features someone might want, but not list them on the packaging."
1,Booo,"Not the worst movie in the history of the Remake sub-category, but so close it can't be distinguished from its pitiful contenders.See the original instead, which is really a delightfull thriller."
1,What the .... ??,"Here's another Hollywood remake of what was a great story (and a great movie as well). So far, this ranks as the worst remake of an action/spy movie that I can recall having seen. There's not one ounce of correlation between this movie and the origial ""The day of the Jackal"" (the book) other than the fact that the assasin in question has the same name! The suspense found in the book (and the movie with Edward Fox) has been replaced by cheap action scenes. Case in point: the killing of Jack Black, the creator of the ""rifle"" that Bruce Willis is using...Even if you haven't read the book or seen the original movie, this only adds up to a mediocre action movie. And what is that accent that Richard Gere is attempting?"
4,Bashful's DVD Summary #027,"Best:1) Bruce Willis was very cool as the aloof assassin, as was Richard Gere in the non-standard role the Irish ex-IRA soldier tracking him.2) Many scenes were suspensful and exciting - especially the ending. There's also a twist about who the assassin is really targeting.3) The specially-built hardware the ""Jackal"" used was extremely radical and watching him practice was quite a sight.4) There's a director commentary track, interviews and a behind-the-scenes feature.Worst:1) It falls short of being a worthy remake of ""The Day of the Jackal"" (but it delivers on simply being a good movie that uses the same premise).Recommendation:If you like movies that are mostly suspense, then you'll probably like this cat-and-mouse thriller. The action scenes, although brief, are pretty intense. Get this one and enjoy seeing the ever-joking Jack Black getting his just deserts - over and over again (ha)."
1,Stupid is as Stupid does!,To say this picture is stupid is to over rate it! I don't understand why such stars would lend their names to a script that must have been written by a committee of dum dums.
1,The worst ending of a movie I have ever seen!!,The movie was entertaining and the acting was good at least by Bruce Willis. The whole movie is about Willis building a remote control weapon for an assasination. So why does he stand in between the gun and the target when he could be 5 miles away? This ruined the whole movie for me. Maybe filmmakers should be more concerned with storyline than big actors and special effects to carry their film through. A better example of a movie remake with a real story would be the Fugitive with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. Maybe the director should look at this film more closely. Don't bother buying this film unless you like disappointing endings!
5,Action packed thriller,"The Jackal is a great action movie, though some of my favorite scenes are more humerous than action oriented. Particularly a scene where Bruce Willis' character and another fellow test out a gattling gun. I thought that other fellow was absolutly hilarious and really made this movie for me. Unfortunatly with these older collectors edition movies, then tend to cost quit a bit more, but I think the extra cost is worth it. This movie has a lot of twists and turns for someone who hasn't previously seen it, but once you've seen it a couple times, it loses the shock value, and just becomes a cool action movie. This is definetly a movie I would recommend adding to your dvd collection."
1,"Double Sided Disks Are Evil, Don't Buy This Release","Universal, for some reason, has elected to continue to produce these double sided disks that contains the Blu-ray movie on one side and the DVD on the flip-side. Why is it that Universal cannot follow in Disney's lead and release these movies as two disk sets. Disney has combo disks that contains the Blu ray and DVD version in the same release, but the DVD and Blu ray disks are on separate disks, utilizing single sided disks.I seriously do NOT recommend this item for purchase."
4,"Gere has an accent and Willis changes identitys, good","a solid thriller with Willis as The Jackal and he is hiring to kill a man, Gere is the man in prison who knows The Jackal's evern move. good beginning with the club scene then goes into that famouse scene where the guy gets an axe in the back of the head and then it gets good with Willis switching faces and putting beards on. by the end we have an assassination attempt, a great chase threw the subway and a killer ending. Willis has never been better, Gere with a great Irish accent, Poitier always enjoyable."
4,An earful of Spinna,"DJ Spinna shows why he is one of the most prolific producers on the scene today by way of ""All Mixed Up"", his extensive catalog of remixes. There aren't many Hip Hoppers included on this project apart from notables De La Soul and Mos Def. The rest are DJ Spinna's remixes of club hits and R&B cuts which include the likes of Les Nubians and the sublimely soulful Terranova. Spinna provides a diverse body of work (which is plenty) and keeps the beats heavy and energetic. There are two CD's included here. The first is DJ Spinna's own mix, as he seamlessly meshes each cut into the other without compromising the continuity of songs. The second is unmixed with fewer of the tracks listed. Regardless, a very good project top to bottom."
1,Fake Adidas,"Not as original adidas, this is a fake one. I ordered two pairs for my sons, this one did not last long, it is not even leather."
5,Knives,I ordered these knives for my husband because he likes using certain kitchen tools. These knives are the ones he always reaches for first. He loves them.
3,The Battle Of Thr River Plate,"Typical battle scenes, what happened to the German captain afterwardsleaves alot to be desired. Read the actual accounting for his true suicideand the reason for the decision."
4,Excellent DVD of great World War II drama,"This reveiw is for Hen's Tooth Video's recent DVD of this film.The DVD quality is excellent. It is in anamorphic 1.85:1 widescreen, and the picture quality is fantastic. Like most Michael Powell productions, it is a beautifully photographed film.The DVD also has a 24-minute featurette, which includes interveiws with some of the surviving crewmembers, such as Christopher Lee. This DVD extra has some information, but not a lot. It actually leaves the veiwer with more questions than answers.THE BATTLE OF THE RIVER PLATE/PURSUIT OF THE GRAF SPEE is highly recommended to WWII buffs, history fans and lovers of classic British cinema. Hen's Tooth Video should be commended for making this rare film available on Region 1 DVD."
4,The Graf Spee doomed...,"Remembered watching this movie many years ago and enjoyed it, for it is based ontrue events (most of it anyway). For the US version it was called Pursuit of theGraf Spee as I remember. I managed to tape it off of Cinemax back in the 80'sbut later on wanted a dvd copy instead...so waited and waited. Finally cameavailable and plunked down the money for a copy. Peter Finch is excellant asthe German Captain. Battle scenes were decent and bonus feature included with itand there is talk of actually raising her from the mud. Some guns have been salavaged.(Youtube has some videos of it). Hey might be time for a remake???But now my copy sits in my war room, next to Sink the Bismark, Das Boot and Sailorof the King. Give it 4/5 stars...enjoy watching."
4,War Movie I have heard about,"Never saw it before. Sat through it and was entertained. As film okay, not great. As history, sad. There is a reason why Britain was a naval super power."
4,Widescreen at last.,"Great to have it on Blue-Ray and widescreen. Excellent picture quality. The use of real ships instead of models or CGI makes the action much more realistic. Dont let the German release put you off, it's in English too."
1,Spare your time...,"If you, like myself, want to learn more about the story of the Graf Spee, look for a book, not this film. Film standards quite weak. No subtitles. Lots of obvious studio scenes. However very good restoration of the original movie material"
5,Laid-Back-Good-On-The-Ears Listening Music!,"I've heard only a little bit about Ray LaMontagne before I bought this CD. So I decided to take the risk and buy the CD, rather than download it off the internet. I'm so glad I took that risk!This CD is beautiful. It reminds me of good folk music, pop, and some blues all mixed in one. Be ready to catch yourself singing along, getting lost in the music, and feeling moved by the music.Ray LaMontagne has some SERIOUS talent and it's wonderful listening to someone who plays for the music, and not the fame, MTV appearences, or the money."
3,"Not bad, but not visionary","I was not completely unsatisfied with this CD. The opener ""Trouble"" is strong. Other tracks that stand out to me are ""Jolene,"" ""Forever My Friend,"" and ""Hannah."" The problem I have with this CD is that after listening to the first few songs they all start to mesh together and sound the same. The chord changes are very similar for all of the songs and extremely predictable (musicians with good ears will know what I'm talking about). This isn't necessarilly a mark of a bad songwriter or a bad album. I just wish it had been a little more varied. Also, don't expect to shake your booty or be uplifted. If you need a decent acoustic CD to put on and brood, then this is a pretty safe bet."
5,GREAT album,"Oh, Ray - you can sing to me all day long. This is a GREAT CD of wonderful songs. Obviously his titled track, Trouble is most recognized and great but all of the songs are fantastic."
4,Trouble CD,"Good stuff. I'm not compelled to listen to it repeatedly (except the song ""Trouble""), but it's a good CD."
4,Otis meets Van,"This albumn has a very cool sound -- Ray Lamontagne brings a bit of Otis Redding to the kind of Marin County folk tunes Van Morrison produced during his best years. The Otis comparison is not to say that Ray has the same power in his vocals -- he's much more restrained as fits the genre -- more that he has the same feeling of emotion that's almost struggling to get out that Redding brought to many of his songs. While most of this album is comprised of mellow acoustic guitar, mournful harmonica and quieted down drums, its does have a couple of deviations from format in songs like ""Forever My Friend"" and ""How Come"" which strongly resemble Dave Mason songs (the later bearing a strong resemblance to ""Feelin' Alright"" in both its sound and its merging of downer lyrics with upbeat tempos). Definitely not an albumn of party tunes, but good chill out music if you want something with a little more depth than Jack Johnson."
5,Fabulous!,I had only heard a couple of the songs on this CD on the radio so I was a bit apprehensive about buying it. I am so glad I did! Each song is different but similiar in style. It may sound like an oxymoron but it is not. I'm looking forward to the next offering by this talent!
1,Do you like pretend blues?,"If you like Eric Clapton's brand of fake blues and rock, then this is for you.One can picture LaMontagne hunched over his guitar, eyes clenched shut, with a forced look of pained intensity on his face, as he croaks out his trite, insipid lyrics. Like Clapton."
1,disappointed,I ordered Trouble thinking I was getting a CD - but instead received a record (I no longer have a record player) didn't realize they even made records anymore. Duh!!! Shirley
4,Ray is the real deal,I saw Ray in New York with Bill Ricchini last year (also one of my favorite songwriters) and let me just say that Ray is the real deal!
5,No Trouble loving this,"a great album of jazzy, bluesy, New Orleans singing. I ordered 5 more to give to my friends"
4,Fantastic,"I bought this album based on the strength of just one song...I was so happily suprised to find the entire album was great. There are not a lot of albums I enjoy listening to start to finish; When I find one I put it on my ""desert island"" short list--this album made it there right away. The songs are simple, well crafted and beautiful. LaMontagne's voice is gorgeous and can run from mournful to joyful in three songs. He cites both Otis Redding and CSNY as influences and both are apparent on different tracks without the artist ever once sounding unoriginal. Loved it. I took away one star for one reason only, and maybe its an unfair one--the album is extremely mellow almost entirely, which means there may be certain times and or places that its just not the one you reach for."
5,Loved the entire album!,It's very rare that I find an album that I love the whole way through and this is most certainly one of them. I can't wait for an encore from Ray Lamontagne!
5,Ray's Gotta Voice,"Ray LaMontagne has got himself a voice indeed. Acoustic guitar with a soulful voice makes this cd. The lyrics are pretty good and heart felt as well. I found out about Ray from watching Late Night with Conan O'brian and he was performing ""Trouble"", I then researched Ray on Amazon, listened to some samples, and that was enough for me to buy this wonderful album. Get this album it's great. Oh yeah, and find Jesus to."
5,Never old,"This CD amazes me every time I listen to it - it simply never wears me down. It's incredibly versatile. No matter what mood I'm in, it works. Lamontagne's voice is beautiful. One listen, and you're hooked."
3,Bad Vinyl Experience,"I also have the CD version of this album, my complaint lies not with the content. I'm not sure if the problem is the Sony Legacy label, or the actual company that pressed the record, but there is no reason why a record of this stature shouldn't come on 180 Grams of Vinyl (poor business decision-Sony). Also, the record was dusty right out of the sleeve and the edges were poorly smoothed (poor quality control-record presser). In all i found the record to be a flimsy experience that wasn't worth the premium. Maybe other Vinyl fans haven't found the same problems, but for me i was definitely disappointed in my purchase."
5,"Great musician, great album, great live performer!","I have had this CD in constant play in my car and home for the last 6 months. My sister got me hooked after hearing Ray Lamontagne at Bonaroo Festival in 2004. I saw Ray play a small club in Indianapolis and I'm even more enamored with the music. Its beautiful and I can't even begin to compare it to anything else I've heard. Just buy it, you won't be sorry!"
4,beautiful voice,What a gorgeous voice this man has. I love this album - it's soulful and great to relax to. My favorite tracks are Trouble and Hannah.
4,Great start,Voice reminds me of Ted Hawkins (not quite the range of Ted). Look forward to a lot of great songs to come. I bet he's great live.
4,"Incredible voice, too much sadness","This incredibly sexy, soulful voice cries out for hope. Trouble, Forever My Friend, is on track with the instrumentation and arrangement. We need an artist of this quality to uplift us with his passion and his talent. I would buy all of his albums if his view turned more towards the light."
5,Fantastic CD,"I bought Ray's CD this morning and I'm already completely taken with it. I certainly hope that this is only the first of many, many releases from him !"
5,What a Monster Talent,"Like many others, I became aware of him because ""Trouble"" was the sound track behind a Travelers Insurance commercial during the summer of 2011 while I was laid up in the hospital. Bonus - the whole CD is excellant. In time, I'll buyall of his recordings."
4,Worth Buying!,"I bought this CD because of the song ""Trouble"". I wish more of the songs on this cd carried the same vib, but they didn't. I still consider it a good cd to purchase. I play it often, but I expected more!"
5,Instant Love!!,"I'd never even heard of Ray LaMontagne until a few days ago when I saw a brief ad for ""Trouble"" on SBS TV here in Australia.Well, I only needed to hear a few seconds grab of a couple of the songs for me to instantly fall in love. I knew immediately I was listening to something great. I rushed out the next day and bought a copy and I haven't stopped either listening to it or singing the songs in my head wherever I go.What a voice! What passion, pain, love, longing and joy he manages to convey in this beautiful, beautiful album of 10 marvellous songs. I love every song on the album (but special favourites are Hannah, Jolene & Forever My Friend).I'm going to pass the word amongst family & friends to buy this CD. As many people as possible deserve to know about and appreciate such a talent as this!"
5,Great stuff,"I saw a review of this cd on Sunday Morning, and wow were they right, what a great cd! He has a soulful voice that really gets to you and the songs really say something rather than having merely a catchy phrase or tune. I am a big fan and will be buying whatever he puts out next!"
3,The Trouble with Trouble,"The opening title track on this debut album serves as both a blessing and a curse. It is a timeless, earthy, powerful song that grabs the listener by both ears and hangs on tight. It could be an out-take from `Moondance' or `Saint Dominic's Preview'. It leads you to believe you have struck the mother lode. Unfortunately, all that follows pales in comparison. Although the rest of the songs are decent efforts in a folk/r&B hybrid and Lamontagne proves himself a strong, distinctive singer throughout, he never again approaches the urgency of that opening cut. Likewise, while production by the highly skilled Ethan Johns showcases Lamontagne's material in the finest possible light, Mr. Johns' presence also reminds us that, as a songwriter, at this stage of his career, Lamontagne is not quite in a league with Johns' former collaborator, Ryan Adams. This record still is an enjoyable listen to an artist bristling with potential."
2,"sorry, but...very predictable and mundane...","I was expecting great things from my first Ben Bova novel, but I'm afraid the dialog is too corny for me! I'm used to reading Dan Simmons and Ian M. Banks, and I guess I was expecting a little more flair... the plot and ideas are good, but it just didn't cut the mustard for me as a novel. I just didn't find myself believing the characters were for real... as one reviewer put it - made-for-TV. On the plus side, there are quite a few tense moments that are well-crafted. But not enough to sustain the momentum for such a long book... in the end I didn't really care what happened to the characters. In summary: look elsewhere for deep characters and thought-provoking prose..."
2,"Weak characterizations, coupled with mediocre plot.","After reading Icehenge and Moving Mars, Bova's characters are paper thin and unbelievable. The plot pace jerks along from one implausible situation to the next. This book and the sequel, Moonwar are a great disappointment to those of us who like 'realism' in their science fiction."
1,Cliche characters and nanotech as window dressing only,The psycho son Greg was so boring killing everyone. I had to skim over half the book. I couldn't even finish this slop. What a waste of time? So unoriginal!!
3,Readable yarn from the Arthur Hailey school of sci-fi,"This has made-for-TV stamped all over it; Politics, a family dynasty with sibling rivalry, clear-cut heroes and villains all wrapped up in a huge dose of political correctness. The plot does rattle along at a fair old pace though and I had no trouble finishing the book. If however you prefer your sci-fi to be on a grander scale and more visionary (Iain Banks for example) , you will probably find this rather tame. On the whole not bad (and much better than the sequel Moonwar), but not a classic."
5,Show me the Rock,"Knuckle Sandwich is a catchy blend of rock-punk, with roots in hardcore, tossed together with the sing along choruses of 80's hair metal. The music combined with ""in your face lyrics"" infiltrates the brain and remain long after you stop listening to the band."
5,WILL BLOW YOUR MIND,"Mark my words, you WILL see these guys at the MTV music awards some day soon. Just listen to ""American Song"" and you will see what I mean. No matter what music your into, this song will grab you by your inner core, shake you up, make you scream your an american, and snarl you as an addict to Knuckle Sandwich. The rest of the tracks on the CD prove only that they are on there way ROARING to the top. You guys ROCK!Now THIS is a Knuckle SANDWICH that will make me come back for 2nd's, 3rd's, 4th's....."
1,definately not 5-stars,"Decent CD, not all that its hyped up to be, definately gets boring after awhile but if you like 80's hair bands, the singer sounds a lot like them and this cd would be good for you."
2,You just can't kill that damn religion.,"This is another Henry Fonda snooze-fest. He plays a fugitive preist in a ficticious banana republic that has outlawed religion. Worse, they've outlawed wine. I immediately concluded that the the rest of the priests must be witless fools if he is the only one left. He goes about baptizing babies, hearing confessions, performing last rites & other acts of terrorism. Needless to say, this this has nothing to do with the tv series or Harrison Ford movie of the same name. At least they were entertaining. This is an unremtting grim message movie. It doesn't work. Excellent camera technique. Strange angles & use of dark shadows & lots of imagery. The camers loves Delores del Rio as the Madonna metaphor. Director John Ford did many excellent movies with John Wayne & Henry Fonda but this was his favorite. Go figure"
2,More John Ford Than Graham Greene,"Director John Ford's sanitized adaptation of Graham Greene's ""The Power and the Glory"" is best remembered for Gabriel Figueroa's atmospheric cinematography. Unfortunately, the Dudley Nichols screenplay bears little relation to Greene's novel - reflected in Henry Fonda's miscasting as the pursued Mexican priest. J. Carrol Naish deserves special mention for his ridiculous portrayal of an Indian informant. Dolores del Rio, Pedro Armendáriz and Ward Bond do their best under less-than-ideal circumstances. Despite Figueroa's superb location work, ""The Fugitive"" looks like an art film gone hopelessly awry. One of Ford's genuine misfires."
3,Portrait of Religious Persecution,"Based on the novel ""The Labyrinthine Ways"" by Graham Greene which is also known as ""The Power and the Glory"" as noted by other reviewers. Filmed in Mexico but the story takes place in an anonymous un-named country ""1000 miles North or South of the Equator"". Its a good portrayal of religious persecution. Non-Catholics may not fully appreciate some of the scenes with Henry Fonda where his priest character is searching the village for wine so that he can celebrate Mass. There is no wine but apparently an abundance of bootleg brandy. If you watch the film, the power and the glory, so to speak, comes in the very last scene at the tail end of the movie."
5,The Palestinian side of the story is told,"Bravo Joe Sacco. This book is one of the very very rare instances in which the Palestinian side of the story is told. Unfortunately a drop in the ocean as compared to the 50+ years of Israeli propaganda and revisionist history (not to mention its on going brutal & illegal occupation). If this changes the opinion of a hand full of people, Joe can raise his head high. It is fairly unique piece of work."
3,A Unique Trip through Palestinian Eyes,"What makes this work valuable is the focus on the views of the Palestinian without even attempting to explain the history and events that lead to their plight. Sacco just suspends the why's.What we see is a dark, depressed and oppressed people who unfortunately harbour a growing hatred and resentment towards the Israelis. It does not leave you hopeful for a peaceful solution anytime soon.It is biased, but does not pretend to be anything else. It is also enlightening. The comic style makes it an easy way to get a picture of the Palestinian Viewpoint; it turns a narrative into a picture.For those of us in the west looking for another viewpoint it is worthwhile."
5,What a great book.,"Sacco never preaches, he just reports. And the reporting gave me all sorts of insight into what our media never seems to touch: the lives of ordinary Palestinians, day-to-day. It is astounding. And Sacco is not an apologist for terrorism; in fact he doesn't even discuss Palestinian terrorists. He just talks about what he saw: regular people. Sometimes intelligent and noble, sometimes small-minded and misguided. Just like people everywhere else. But when you think that SO many Palestinians have lived under these contitions their whole lives- have never travelled, and every Jew they have ever met has been a settler or a soldier- you start to understand why this is a no-win situation for anyone."
1,Distorted,"Palestinians have suffered, but just blaming Israel for everything means they will never get peace, never have a decent economy because they think Israel owes them something and will keep trying to destroy Israel.Palestinian leaders' corruption, indoctrination against Israel in schools and media breeds only hatred of Israel for no benefit.Palestinians must learn to live with Israel in Peace and stop exploding bombs on buses, firing missiles into Israel, to stop using knives such as on the Fogel family living in the ancient jewish homelands of Judea and Samaria. 2 terrorists came into their house, stabbed and shot the parents and children and cut off the baby's head.Comic books such as this distort the picture, and make peace harder to obtain."
1,"Terrible writing, lack of facts with reputable sources =CRAP","This book was written by a man who supported deadly terrorist attacks against ISraeli and Jewish civilians. (...) Schoolchildren are taught from an early age to hate anything Jewish or American because it symbolizes what life as a free person would be like.When books with so few truthful statements like this are made, I can only imagine how many lies about Israeli history are being taught in Universities across the country.Palestine is not a book based on facts, but rather a mythical history in which the Palestinians claim they were the Phillistines, an Aegean sea-faring people who have long been extinct. The facts and history are out there, (...)and others have compiled a large volume of history and facts about this land that will help combat evil lies such as ""Palestine""I give this book 2 thumbs down and -2 (negative) stars"
1,Anti-Semitism at it's best !!!,"If you your going to read an objective book on the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict you are wrong! This blatantly blames Israel for all the problems in the Palestinian territories and if you read between the lines it insinuates that it's not the Israelis who are to blame but the Jews. If you want an objective book on the conflict I suggest you read Alan Dershowitz's books, The Case for Israel and The Case for Peace."
1,"Those who cannot write prose ""write"" comics","What a waste. Sacco could reach a much wider audience if he had written essays. But, wait...does he have the talent to write essays? Being ""cool & edgy"" apparently has more meaning to him than making a legitimate difference in the world, in general, and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically. Additionally, he is both biased and sexist in his writing."
5,Middle East 101,"If you know absolutely nothing about where all the trouble began then this is a must read. Sacco is incredibly good at breaking complexities down; not only making them understandable but making it personal. You would think that 'graphic literature' would allow you to remain safely detached from the illustrated events but Mr Sacco's offerings have quite the opposite effect. It is impossible to properly describe the experience; bit like taking a picture of the Grand Canyon instead of standing on the lip of a thousand foot precipice. Once you're read one you'll be hooked, addicted; one won't be enough."
5,The Truth behind all the Pain ..,"This is probably the best book out there that'll make you understand what you never understood before , A true Graphic novel that captured what other artists haven't .. 10\10 You can't live without reading this, Just give it a chance .. You wont be the same ."
5,True,"Excellent depiction of daily life. An intense portrayal of persons and circumstances, with an amazing ability to stay in observer role.I highly recommend this book for any interested party."
5,A special edition how wonderful,"Along with all other books that need to have special editions such asThe Complete Maus: A Survivor's Talethis wonderful dialouge between man and history, between artist and struggle and between activist and history calls for a special edition. And who better to bring it than the creative team of Sacco, Vanzetti and Said. A wonderful book that has few parrellels in the world of cartoon, drawing, and activism in dealing with the sadness and sorrow of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how it affects the children."
5,This book is educational,"My intent in reading this book was to try and learn what motivates the Palestinian people to hate Israel and also, people like myself who are Jewish. This is a one sided book and that was exactly what I was looking for. To truly research a subject as complex as Israel and the Palestinians, one must perform a synoptical reading of many books to get closer to the ""truth"". This book provided for me a deeper understanding as to why I am hated by so many Palestinians.I recommend this book for all Jews and Palestinians who are interested in learning about themselves and others. There are many disturbing facts mentioned in this book which I intend to research the validity of. Whether these are accurate facts or not, this book will blantantly allow anyone to understand why Israel and Jews are hated by many Palestinians."
4,It's Great for High School!,"Well, A-level is for High School, not really for college level. I agree with Adel Douba that the book doesn't point out necessary information, but most of the college text books in US never mention what you have pointed out! Hey, for high school, it is a pretty good book, don't you agree? You don't see any high school book mentions anything about log(-8)[base -2] has no meaning, neither any of them mentions the unequality of a with 1. This is for college level!!! Again, A-level is just for Grade 9-12 in most of the other countries."
2,"New category: ""True Crime Lite""","If you can even find this book, it will only satisfy those die-hards who haven't had enough newspaper/tv exposure of this case. After reading this very short book, I didn't learn much more about the case or persons involved. Furthermore, the book ends before the case went to trial. Lots of filler, including transcripts from two radio programs."
4,"Tough Going at times, but worth it.","Make no mistake -- this book would be at home in an Engineering Class. It will make you THINK and examine his teaching of Single Board Systems at a higher level.+ If you want a ""cut & paste"" book to get thru a rough spot & finish a project that is due, you'll be disappointed.+ If you want to understand what you are doing so that you can apply your skills better, you'll like it. No free lunch, remember?"
1,WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"This is the only book about microchip PIC18f452, but the only useful information this book has to offer is in chapter 2 and 3, after that you get lost trying to understand what the author is talking about. Chapter 2 and 3 cover only the basics, nothing else. Save your money! more books on microchip are coming up. If you have to take a microcontroller class, then you better get a good instructor."
4,Pretty good Techno,"I picked up a copy of this CD in Germany awhile back. It gives a techno/rave feel with the beats and melody. Strong drug (weed and getting high)overtones. Overall, not a bad one to pick up. If you're more into Trance pass this one by. If you love rave with a different edge this is for you."
3,Not an Armalite,"The item that I received is not an Armalite product, the carry handle elevation wheel does allow me to make adjustment for Revised Improved Battlefield Zero, so its a quality carry handle, but certainly not a Armalite because it is lacking two key features of Armalite carry handles, one is its unique knurled steel thumb nuts and the cross lug under the carry handle. If you want an authentic Armalite carry handle, go to the Armalite website."
3,I gave up on it,"shortly after their tragic return from Italy. The set-up just didn't get me interested; it seemed, at times, too Harlequin-esque (UK: Mills & Boon). The new sous-chef seemed quite interesting, but I didn't care enough about Tom and Tally to carry on. I give these comments not to dissuade folks from reading the book, but to let others who find it rough going know they weren't the only ones."
4,Not exactly,"Although the book was in good condition, it did not look like the picture of the book shown. Instead of beige and brown binding, it was in lavender. So for buyers who buy for the aesthetics as well as the literary content, this should be a warning. I think 1 or 2 pages were missing, but overall this was a fair purchase."
2,"Not the best of series, but gives understanding of Midlands","This book was a little dissapointing from the previous 4, It does enlarge the understanding of how the Midlands and its people think and feel, but I felt that these things could have been explained during the story told of Richard and Kahlen, instead of the reverse. The story is about political intrigue and one of the small nations of the Midlands with a secret power not quite understood. It is the first real battleground in the New World fought between Jagang and Richard, through diplomacy and intrigue."
3,Interesting. It keeps you guessing about the final outcome.,"""Soul of Fire"" was an interesting read. Richard, Khalan, and Zed are back, and are finally reuinited with eachother. Although Goodkind showed his usual inventive imagination about Richard Cypher's ever-growing abilities, this chapter in the ""Sword of Truth"" saga lacked in areas. There is too, much enfacise on the book's new characters and not enough on the heros. When is he going to deal with the Imperial Army? Jagang, the chief nemesis of both the ""New World"" and the ""Old World"" has not been given proper time again. In summary: It was a very interesting book. It's well written and has enough information to keep the die-hard ""Sword of Truth"" fans involved in the adventure. As compared to the first three books, ""Soul of Fire"" lacks certain elements. It is about as good as ""Temple of Winds"". It is an enjoyable read."
3,What happened to the magic?,"After reading _Temple of the Winds_ I was really looking forward to reading the next installment of Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. What I read was as exciting as watching the grass grow. In all of his previous books there was magic, maniacs, and mayhem, but with _Soul of the Fire_ it gets completly boring with all of the politcal jumble and what not. The most boring part was the story of Beata. He (Goodkind) could have filled up the empty space with something more attractive to the senses. I definatly hope that the next book will be much better than its predecessor."
4,great story line,"Book five of the series is just another masterpiece. This book keeped me wanting to read and continue to read, I can't wait till the next book comes out and I find out what happens to Kahlan and Richard."
5,Easy fast read books.,"I thought this book was good. It kept you interested and it makes you wonder what will happen to the bad guys in the end. It a good series if you want a light read series. Sure the series is about or around forty books, but from I know they are all about 180 pages. I can read one of these books in a couple of hours. They may not be long, but the author definitely did not waste any page space by boring you with unnecessary details. I will definitely read more in the series.thank you for your timeand feel free to commentthis review,Loran"
4,Pretty good,"I liked this book, but it was a little hard to get through. I ended up not reading every day because I couldn't seem to get into it. Towards the end, like most Nancy Drew books, I got into it and finished it.In this one, Nancy and her friend, Helen Corning, go on a vacation and go on a motorboat ride. A terrible storm comes and wrecks their boat. They almost die when a sixteen year old girl saves them. Her name is Laura and she's an orphan. Her new guardians are mean to her and instantly try to get her jewels. Laura escapes from them and goes to Nancy's house and stays with Hannah while Nancy tries to help her. Towards the end, this book gets way better!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Bungalows are deadly. Well, not really, she doesn't live in Midsomer.However, accidents in boats can be a bit on the dangerous side, and this happens to the young chick.Apart from that, she has to check out a couple of dodgy adults, look into some thieving, and stay dressed nicely."
1,Kinda sucked,"Even though the book kinda sucked, I really did not like it I would not recommend it because it wastes your money and is really bad and totally sucks DO NOT BUY I had to rate it at least one star, but I actually wanted to rate it 0 starsSubmitted by: An identity of the same"
5,Second Best,"This was the 2nd best book in the series, only to its predecessor, The Hidden Staircase. The book kicks into action around page 70 and is non-stop suspense from there on. Its actually one of the few books that has a good mystery in the story and the cliff hangers at the end of each chapter are well thought out. In my opinion most of the Nancy Drew books were awful. The set is over rated. Of the original 56 books, about 25 of them are good. Half the set. This ranks in at #2 with me."
3,"Boring title, Good book...(*** 1/2 stars...)","I read the 1930 version of this book. The title is boring, tho somehow caught my intrest as well; what in the world could be so mysterious about a bungalow? The book is a pretty good installment in the series, anyway. The part where Nancy hides inside the dark bungalow is suspenful, and is one of the rare moments is a Nancy Drew book where I was on the edge of my seat!"
4,"It's great, and it keeps your mind thinking!","It introduces new characters and has fun and strange plot twists!!! The characters are very real, and you can relate to them. Nancy has done it again!"
4,too engrossing,I started reading this book one late night.It was so interesting that i slept late morning
3,The Bungalow Mystery,"The Bungalow Mystery is exiting and thrilling!Nancy Drew and Hellen Corning,are invited to Lilac Inn to help there friend Emily plann her wedding, but then strange things begin happening at Lilac Inn,as always Nancy Drew takes the case! The It is one of my favorite books of the series of Nancy Drew! It is pretty intriging and exiting!"
3,This is an OK book.,Nancy is a great detective. I've read almost all of her books. I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't the best. I recomend The Mysterious Mannequin.
5,The Bungalow Mystery,I love this book because it is surprising. I would recommend this book to people who love the excitement of a mystery.
1,"BEWARE! Problems, may no longer be supported!!","I just purchased this card. It recognized two Seagate Barracuda 500GB UDMA/100 drives, but the other two drives (also Seagate Barracuda drives, identical to the first except 750GB capacity) were seen as 8GB drives.Response to my question by Promise's Tech support was:""This 750gigs drive is something that Promise have not tested or qualify with the Fasttrak100 TX2 so we don't know if this drive will be compatible or not. Also with the Fasttrak100 TX2 controller is EOL(End of Life)and is no longer in manufacture.""I am trying to follow up for additional support, but so far it looks like there is no intention of supporting due to EOL. I have also asked how long this product has been discontinued and will post if I get an answer.In the mean time....BEWARE!"
5,One Of The Best,"Been a fan of Davids since the seventies and he has to be one of the greatest singer songwriters around to be sure. His New York blues/folk style of guitar sounds to his songwriting he combines the perfect sounds that are not forgotten and have been with me for years and will be theres years to come. This is one of those records that has to be on every guitarist need to have list and songwriters need to learn list. This record is a 'must have' and to be sure has to be one of the better records he's ever recorded, a seventies stable to be sure."
5,A GREAT DEAL,"In case you were wondering, this is a double sided DVD with the main features and the special features the way they were orginally released, so it really is like having two DVDs for the price of one."
3,"Double Feature ""Whole 9 & 10 Yards""","While ""The Whole 9 Yards"" is a delighteful movie that is fun to watch and deserves 5 stars...Willis, Perry and Duncan play off each other very well and Natasha Hentsridge is a doll, without a doubt ""The Whole 10 Yards"" has got to be the worst sequel ever made and doesn't even deserve 1 star!! The script is awful and whoever dreamed up forcing the viewers to endure a film of incompetent bad guys should never work in Hollywood again!! An insult to any person watching. For Bruce Will to ""star"" in this movie...well, I guess he needed money for gambling debts or alimony!!"
3,Entertaining,The movies are fun and funny. Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis play off of each other well. Amanda Peet is charming.
4,Not bad at all,"The Whole Nine Yards won't win any Oscars, but it's a reasonably funny film and certainly worth the five dollars I paid for it. The sequel is funny too, but falls into the standard sequel traps and has a pretty nonsensical ending. Anyway, it's nice to have both for completion's sake.If you like this film, I would recommend Get Shorty and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), both of which I feel are better."
5,"Great Price, Fast Delivery",I am very impressed with the purchase of this item. It was priced well below everyone else and delivered exactly when promised.
5,One of my favourite CD's ...,This is one of the sweetest CD'd to learn to zydeco dance to ... or just crank it up in the car!I LOVE this man's voice and soulful crooning ... oh yeah!
4,Do the math.,"Make sure you compare the price of the set with buying each ink individually. I discovered today that it is actually 18 dollars cheaper to buy the inks separately than to buy this set. The prices may change later, so this won't necessarily always be true. Just take a moment to compare before you assume you are saving money by buying a set."
1,Need more detail,"The Stylus R2400 printer uses 9 ink cartridges. This product offers 8, but does not identify the missing cartridge. Wouldn't it be better if the buyer could know which cartridge he/she needs to have to complete the set?"
5,"Abstracts of the Deeds of Rowan County, NC 1753-1785",Excellent research material. Well organized and of much benefit for those who are looking for ancestors who owned land in early Rowan County of North Carolina.
1,Not such a good deal!,"Sounded like a good deal at first, lightweight, good price. But it does not come with a case, and clipped nails are on their way out and hard to find in small smooth sizes.Returned it and got Porter-Cable full head nailer with a case. Love it."
1,Milwaukee is discontinuing its line of pneumatic nailers,"I went to Milwaukee's home page and reviewed the firm's entire tool catalogue. I could not find any pneumatic nailers illustrated in the catalogue. Apparently, Milwaukee is discontinuing its line of pneumatic nailers."
4,Milwaukee nailing gun,I found the product to be a pretty decent nailer. It performed as well as nailguns that cost twice as much. The only setback for the Milwaukee nail gun was the ease of loading and unloading the nails. It seems the nails should slide down the sleeve a little easier for removal.
1,Ambitious though disappointing,I picked up this book expecting a look at the many facets of the U.S. military and law enforcement special operations and counter-terrorist community though was disappointed by the units ultimately selected. The narrative is weak and not very insightful. I cannot endorse this title.
4,Five-Minute Activities,This book has so many uses! It can be adapted for warm-up activities as well as filling in a few minutes at the end of a lesson. Many of the topics can be expanded into full lessons. Almost all the games can be used to strengthen a topic taught in a lesson in a fun and practical manner. No language teacher should be without this!
2,"Ideas, but they are few and obvious","I only found one idea that I'd consider using in this book. It's thin for $25.00 and the activities are largely variants on very simple ideas I've already seen in fifty other places. I don't think you need this book unless you really have no ideas at all, in which case it's as good as any other book."
4,A superior resource.,"This book's liberal use of tables and algorithms provide excellent overview of the concise, up-to-date text. It is perfect for briefly reviewing current standards in clinical assessment and diagnostic testing between patient visits in a busy outpatient clinic. I will recommend this fairly compact reference to my medical school classmates -- it should be strongly suggested as a textbook for internal medicine and family medicine core clerkship curricula."
5,Timely Resource for Outpatient Clerkships,"This text has been a key resource for my outpatient clerkships. Each chapter addresses a specific presenting problem or known illness, but is summarized in 1-2 pages only. Efficient algorithms and tables increase retrieval of information during the few minutes students have to assimilate their assessment and differential diagnosis before presenting to attendings. A chapter can be read in 5 minutes or less and covers approach, differential, and latest treatment options. This text has been critical to my outpatient medicine and family medicine clerkships!"
4,Hepburn and Tracy at their best!,"Katharine and Spencer's acting is, as usual, superb. This is delighful fun! Although I usually don't care for comedies, this is an exception. Kate and Spence are perfect for each other!"
1,A tediously contrived bore,"Yes, as a few have dared post here, this is one of those sacred cows of Hollywood that simply does not deliver. Perhaps it is not fair to post this review, because I just could not endure it after 25 or so minutes. Numbingly contrived. Humorous? Good luck trying to find it. Hepburn in my opinion is ridiculously lionized. Spencer Tracy, however, is an acting marvel in such films as Father of the Bride.Let Maltin and the other so-called expert critics do duty to Tinsel town rather than risk alienating their insider friends and colleagues. Not I. Maybe it's a matter of ""comedy"" as they say being such a difficult thing, and much of it having a short shelf life."
3,"Adam""s Rib is kicked in the Ribs!",I was disappointed with the colorized version of this film the processing is horrible! I bought it curious what it would look like in color! Believe me the b/w version is the winner! But to give a compliment deserved the audio quality is superb. Do yourself a favor if you want to own this Tracy/Hepburn comedy gem buy the b/w version on vhs not the colorized version on vhs you won't be disappointed that's a fact!
4,Adam's Rib,"It's incredible how you can see the relationship between Amanda and Adam go through this situation when they are in diferent sides and even then they can express their love for each other. They can argue and even then have moments for their own, those little things that really made a couple. And how engenious both of them are to achieve their goals. Watch this movie, it worths."
2,I didn't get it,"I feel this is one of those movies that everybody calls a classic just because they wouldn't dare go against it. Well, I will. Except for the hilarious opening, with Judy Holiday trying to kill her husband, I just didn't think this movie was that funny. The dialogue between Hepburn and Tracy is amusing, but not laugh-out-loud funny. Some may disagree, I know. But watch this movie not thinking it's a famous grand comedy, and you may find that it's not really all that funny. I don't know.... it could just be me. But be warned!For a good Hepburn film, see Bringing Up Baby. For a good Tracy film, see Inherit the Wind. For a good movie about Bruce Campbell fighting zombies, see Army of Darkness."
5,Fun,"This movie is great fun. Hepburn & Tracy are superb as usual, but Ewell & Holliday almost steal the show!"
2,Don't see this film.,"First of all let me say Katharine Hepburn is my favorite actor of all time. Now let me say how much I despised this movie. I had high hopes for this film since I like Judy Holliday and Jean Hagen, however i cannot begin to describe to you how ludicrous this film is. If you have not seen this film save yourself see any other Katharine Hepburn film, or read a book, just don't watch this film. The plot is boring and contrived, and although this film is trying to make a statement about equal rights for women I think it fails. Katharine Hepburn relies too much on Spencer Tracy and the end of the film is a complete let down."
3,Another Tracy & Hepburn team up,"Strong performances, as always, but again the story here may for many be a bit dated. From a student of history's point of view its worth watching."
4,western classic,This is a classic western with western favorites like Ward Bond. Very enjoyable if you like westerns.
5,TERRIFIC FILM; MARRED COMMENTARY,"Great, under-appreciated Western starring the great, under-appreciated BEN JOHNSON (RIO GRANDE / SHANE / MIGHTY JOE YOUNG / ONE-EYED JACKS / WILD BUNCH / LAST PICTURE SHOW / GETAWAY / DILLINGER / ETC.). Terrific story, acting, direction, cinematography - the film actually overcame my natural aversion to singing in Westerns. ONE COMPLAINT: The DVD's excellent commentary (especially by Harry Carey Jr.) was almost ruined by overlong, distracting excerpts from Bogdanovich's well-known John Ford interview, which took way too much attention from the film at hand (even during the climactic shootout!)."
4,John Ford's Hidden Gem,"Sandwiched between ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949) and ""Rio Grande"" (1950), the simple, unpretentious ""Wagon Master"" remains among John Ford's most overlooked films. One of the director's personal favorites, this leisurely Mormon adventure benefits from the Ford Stock Company's strong ensemble and stunning Moab cinematography by Bert Glennon. The performances of Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr. and Ward Bond are splendid. Though not without minor scripting flaws, ""Wagon Master"" is sublime visual poetry in the Ford tradition."
2,sometimes you get what you pay for,"I wish I could give an enthusiastic endorsement for this recording, especially after hearing the very enjoyable Madama Butterfly also on Laserlight. But it was not to be this time. When Don Jose is outsung by Escamillo, it is time to complain. The title role is regrettably not a success either. The orchestral playing, choral singing and sound quality are at least OK. I think for a few dollars more there are several better choices, not the least of which would be the early Karajan set."
3,there's nothing special about this tribute,"Having listened to their albums and live recordings a zillion times, I'm always looking for fresh interpretations of Pink Floyd. Most tributes phonographically copy the original band or fall embarrassingly short in the attempt. Both types are dull. ""A Special Tribute to Pink Floyd"" falls into the first category. That written, there is nothing wrong with this recording. The musicians perform well and the production is excellent. Unlike the Easy Star All-Stars that did a reggae tribute, this is just straight rock. The esteemed Australian Pink Floyd Show also plays literal versions, but it's a live experience. The Aussies appreciate the futility of making such an audio recording. The listener is better off passing this one by and enjoying the originals."
5,Great Primer on Traditional Boatbuilding,"The best all around book on the subject. The author sticks to traditional methods and materials and he's very good at explaining these. It's much more accessible than general boatbuilding manuals such as Steward and Chapelle, but more in depth than the usual how-to book. The drawings are very helpful and the text is clear, concise and well organized (though for some reason there's no index). There are some subjects I would liked to have seen discussed in more detail, but overall a great boatbuilding book."
2,dissapointing,"I'm sorry to say the book did not live up to its AD. It is clearly for people that have already built boats in the past. It constantly used terms not defined. The part on ""Lofting made simple"" left me (a decent wood worker) scratching my head. If you know all about building small boats buy this book. Then again if you already know then you don't need it."
5,awesome service,"This transaction went very smooth without ANY problems! My order arrived on time and in perfect condition.....Thank you, i know i'll be back to shop again!"
3,Building Small Boats,"The book was selected because the search indicated it would provide information about building a curragh (or currach). For that purpose it was useless. Also, one needs to know a good bit about boat building before benefiting from this book."
4,One less thing to worry about every week!,"As if planning the music, scheduling the ministers, setting up and sometimes even baking the bread isn't enough -- the General Intercessions must be prepared. They must be thought provoking, relevant to the Scriptures and timely. Mr. Draves-Arpaia's book does all that. After a quick review of the printed prayer in the book, simply pop the disc into computer -- a few modifications for your church community and timely issues (such as those who've recently received sacraments or are ill) and you're off and running. I use it EVERY week."
4,Excellent book,As a pediatric nurse practitioner I found this book exceptionally useful. Its keen insite on how to handle patients without English as their first language helped me out immensely. I truely recommend this book for all medical professions.
2,slow and painful,"If you have never studied logic, this is the book for you. But if you have, find something else. This book is slow and it spends too much time on the deductive system in propositional logic. Tedious."
1,not even tech n9ne,this is not rap. not rapper tech n9ne from kansas city. cover is a about 40 white guys standing in a field. probably wack. the actual title of this cd is tech-9.
5,A favorite CD for the entire family!,"We absolutely LOVE this CD! I like that the music seems more ""real"" than most kid CDs and the words are humorous and fun to sing along with. When we first got this CD, we went on a 2,000 mile car trip and I think we listened to this CD for about 1000 of those miles! This is also a great CD to dance around the living room to - we've had loads of fun with this CD and I highly recommend it to anyone with a preschooler or grade schooler."
4,Best children's album I own. The 6th best TMBG album I own.,"All of the tracks are amusingly listenable (except for John Lee: Supertaster which I now just automatically forward through).My daughter, almost 3, loves the games and the songs, demanding ""Violin"" and ""Robot Parade"" constantly. It certainly is far more tolerable than her normal selections of Smashmouth and Ralph's World.For adults, well, it's a They Might Be Giants album, entertaining by its own right, but not a must-own. It is a short album and the lyrics lack a certain amount of depth (Not surprising for a kids' album)."
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this CD after reading several of the reviews and generally liking TMBG myself. I must say I am quite disappointed with this CD. The music is, in my opinion, not engaging in the least and strikes me as way too complex for small children. Nothing on this album ""stuck with me"" in the sense that I did not walk away humming any of the songs after hearing them. In fact, I found a few songs to be so unappealing I either felt like I couldn't wait for them to end or I just forwarded to the next track quickly. I do consider myself to have a fairly eclectic taste when it comes to music and was surprised by my aversion to this CD. My recommendation is to consider this only for older children, say age 6 or more and, if possible, try before you buy."
3,Don't let this be your first foray into TMBG,"So many people I know who ""love!!!!!111one!!"" TMBG love them because of this album and then, when they hear tracks off of ""Lincoln"" or the Pink Album, they are mystified and disillusioned.This is a good album with some very cute songs (and who doesn't love ""The Sun""?) but PLEASE don't let this be your first TMBG experience! I don't feel that it's necessarily thier best and it's certainly not what I consider to be thier usual. Buy ""Lincoln,"" buy ""Apollo 18,"" buy ""Flood,"" and THEN buy this one. You'll appreciate them much more for it."
3,No!,"My husband is a huge TMBG fan and when we found out that the theme song for ""Malcolm in the Middle"" was written by them, we started watching the show. Now it was time to get the music."
2,"I also don't see this as being a ""kids album""","Most of these songs could have been on Apollo 18 (my favorite TMBG album by a landslide), but they would have been the weak titles on the CD.I found several of the songs to have jarring, dissonant vibes to them which I'd have to imagine would not appeal to youngsters.A favorite was ""Where do they make balloons"", which sounds a little as if the Monkees were invited to add a track to ""Revolver"". That is certainly one any child will enjoy and any parent could hum along to .. well, at least a few times.I'll come back to my love of Apollo 18. That is a better children's CD than this one... in part because it has dozens of very short songs that are silly and appealing in a Sendak vein (or quickly over). There is not a child's song on ""NO!"" which compares to ""Mammal"" or ""Dinner Bell"" from that collection."
2,HUGE disappointment,"This CD is trying way way too hard to be cool. Not fun to listen to for kids OR adults. I love 'cooler' kids music, but this CD is just plain annoying. Instead I recommend Dan Zanes (formerly of the Del Fuegos) or Justin Roberts for kids music that parents can enjoy."
2,Interesting... but so far only one good song....,"Was disappointed in this, and only found ""Fibber Island"" to be the only really good catchy tune.Although I do applaud TMBG for going with Amazon and allowing their music to go DRM Free (thank you!!!)."
1,"Music is great, but ""special features"" make the CD unusable","I hate to write a negative review of a CD with such amazing music, but it's absolutely unusable.I can play the music, but only song-by-song, using a very annoying flash interface. It does not play correctly in several CD players I've tried (it's not scratched; it takes the CD players multiple minutes to find the tracks and then often can't play tracks 1-3); and on a computer, Winamp, Real Player, and other programs can't find the music to play it directly.It's a darn shame. I bet a lot of people would love this CD, but its ""special features"" make it all but useless."
5,Fantastic children's album for different ages,"My 7-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter have been diverging in musical interests of late. My son wants cooler, more grown-up sounding stuff, whereas my daughter wants simple, silly tunes. Imagine my excitement to find a CD that they both love, and that doesn't bore me as well! This is a fantastic CD that kids of many ages will love, and the lyrics are ""safe"" for even the most conservative of parents (except the implication that one spouse is going to leave another for having to do all the cleaning in ""I am Not your Broom""). Definitely recommended!"
5,Kid-tested and highly recommended,"Well, today is the first day I have enough computer time to write a review. My kids have been playing the games on the CD every day. We had been the website and heard the clips, but that wasn't enough. They had to know what happened to the guy on ""Four of Two"".The games are incredibly cute. I Am a Grocery Bag and The House at the Top of the Tree are favorites.The music may not be fresh enough for the older ""kids"" but mine are 6 and 4 and they love every track. TMBG's other songs may not be unsuitable for younger people but most are certainly above their heads or even a little dark.All in all, another fantastic effort and one I am glad to share with any and everyone."
5,What happened to Particle Man??!!,"I haven't listened to this CD (yet), but I'm furious they didn't put Particle Man on it!!!!!! Particle Man is a great kid's song,I mean it's on Tiny Toon Music TV Video, the animation is great,the characters (Particle Man, Triangle Man, Universe Man, PersonMan) look just like what I pictured them as when I first heard the song. Particle Man is tiny and wimpy (no offense Plucky) andhis 3 arch-enemies are big and beefy. The animation would have worked like a karate-chop on the CD-ROM feature. The kids on theCD case are pretty much Hello Kitty-style as far as cartooning goes. It's very unlike TMBG not to put Particle Man on a kid's CD."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"I read all those rave reviews, listened to the songs....I just don't get it! All I can say is ""You've Got To Be Kidding!"" this is the biggest bunch of c--p I have EVER heard! I wouldnt take it if it was FREE! Save you money folks..even the worst children's music I've heard doesn't compare to this and there is some real garbage out there! I gave it one star because there wasn't anything LESS!"
5,My favorite CD right now,"This is a great CD for kids and adults alike. It has a good mix of fast and slow songs, upbeat and mellow, and great voices too.I love the Edison Museum, 4 minutes of 2, and Sleepy Bones and Lazy Head.I can't say enough good things about this CD."
4,The songs that are good ARE GREAT,This is one of the few children's CDs that both my daughter and I enjoy. We listen to it a lot and some of the best songs are actually very terrific.The enhanced CD function is simple but my daughter really likes that too.
4,YES to NO!,"This little beauty is for the die hard TMBG fan, or the one with little einers. Some songs have the classic They feel, but some are just down right silly. I personally like it, but I can see how a newcomer could sway from this one. However, it warns the purchaser that the child is the target audience, so don't get it if you can't bare to listen to good advice and silly melodies."
3,More for kids than adults,"I eagerly awaited this new CD from TMBG. I knew it was a ""family"" album, but I think it should have been labeled a ""kids"" album. I think i'm about 20 years too old for a lot of the songs on here."
3,"Very cute, but...","I've been listening to the Giants for about 13 years now, loving many of their songs, feeling indifferent to some, and disliking just a few. I have always appreciated their humor and wit and felt their music already had a child-like quality with adult sophistication and musical savvy. This CD is very cute, perhaps for a VERY young child (under 4 maybe?), but I've already had my daughter appreciating songs like ""Doctor Worm"", ""Don't Let's Start"", and ""Birdhouse In Your Soul"" since she was quite young - songs which can already cater to adults and childeren simply because of the catchiness and quirkiness. Songs like these I'd rather expose my daughter to then most of the songs on ""No!"" simply because their other CDs contain much more interesting content. I don't think kids need things spelled out for them - I think it is much more interesting to let them go ahead and have a unique interpretation of things, which I have done, myself, through the years listening to They Might Be Giants."
2,Not really a great kids album.,"I happen to be a big fan of They Might Be Giants. FLOOD is one of my favorite albums of all time. So of course I jumped at the chance to buy this one for my kids.Unfortunately, with the exception of ""Don't Cross The Street,"" most of these songs are regular TMBG songs that just happen to have kid-oriented phrases in the lyrics or the titles.There are some great, edgy kid albums out there. I recommend the fringy Music For Aardvarks line of recordings.But this one didn't cut it--especially with my four-year-old."
5,Great fun for everyone!,"As a big They Might Be Giants fan (I'm wearing a TMBG T-shirt as a write this) I think it's great to see them expanding their potential audience this way. Hopefully buyers of this album will discover TMBG's other great songs, too.All of these songs are great, although some are certainly targeted more at kids and will likely be skipped by some adult listeners.The interactive animations are great fun, and match the typical TMBG artwork on previous album covers and their website. You can get a preview of some of the interactive animation..."
5,kids and parents dig it,"My kids love Elmo, and Dora and the Wiggles. Me, too - they're great! Elmo's Song is often in my head before I fall asleep. :) But No! is one of those CDs we all can listen to and enjoy. And then the No! song is stuck in my head. Which really is better."
5,The Best For Mom And Kids,"Okay,you loved them in college,will you still love them now?Hell yeah!I'm the proud mother of a funky 4yr old and a fab 10yr old,and we all love this C.D.We pretty much love them all (my favorite is ""The House At The Top Of The Tree"")but most of them are classic.My daughter is sort of being brought up in the classical fashion and this is a great example for her.I love that she can come home from choir or ballet and relax listening to two true musical giants who are just flat out FUN!"
4,Great Present,"I bought this cd for my little brother, age 8, because he's all into the pop music thing and i'm slowly trying to transition him to rock music. I was SO excited when i saw that they might be giants had a cd for kids...they think of everything.My brother loves it, so if you're in the same situation (the pop-to-rock transition for little kids) buy this. It's not so much rock, as children's music, but there are some songs with the rock thing going on. Actually, those are his favorite songs on the cd. and im hoping that if he likes one they might be giants cd, he'll start to like another and another until he's a rock-a-holic or whatever.anyway, this cd is only for kids. i listened to about two minutes of it before i had to leave the room, because i was so disappointed in tmbg's 'new sound.' if you're an aspiring fan, don't buy this cd first."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very excited when I saw this light at BestBuy for $19.99. It looked perfect to use for my Kindle since it was so light. However, when I went to turn it on it wouldn't work. I took the cover off and played with the batteries and finally got it to come on. Then the disappointment continued. The light was so dim I could hardly see my Kindle. Needless to say, it's going back today."
5,Haunting,For those who consistently deny the reality of the Holocaust this is a stark reminder of the what happened.It's power is not in grotesque scenes but rather pictures of normal innocent persons on there way to extermination.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest
2,Jamaican Semi-Soul Jams,"This is a compilation of Phyllis Dillon's recordings - not a ""tribute"" in the sense of people recording covers of her recordings.Sure, there are 29 songs - almost 80 minutes of music - but the sound quality is poor. It is not the worst I've ever heard, it is not like an old Ma Rainey or scratchy Billie Holiday recording, but there is not credit given for remastering, and I think it is safe to assume that these recordings, from 1966-1971, were NOT digitally remastered.The music is OK, Dillon is not particularly Soulful or vocally dynamic, but it is some pleasant Reggae/Jamaican-style music. The booklet includes an essay by Mike Atherton and a few photos."
4,"Nice ""Walk""","Cecil Taylor'sNew York City R&B;is one of my favorite avant-garde jazz albums of the early 60s, but alas C.T. albums are often hard to digest so it took me awhile to stomach buying the three other Candid discs of outtakes from these sessions (it helped that I found them on the dollar menu). ""Cell Walk for Celeste"" contains two alternate takes of the title track (the master take was originally featured on ""NYC R&B;""), and two more of ""Jumpin' Punkins"" (yet another CT disc on Candid, featuring of course the master take of that track). Two versions of ""Davis"" complete the set. Many will find ""Cell Walk"" long and arduous, but I'm always up for some exercise for my ears."
4,Worth a read!,"I ordered this book on the advice of a friend who read it while she was pregnant. Before I read it, she told me she had an idea of which birthing experience she thought I'd prefer. Well, I've read it, and she was right!I liked (what seemed to me) the unbiased descriptions of all the different birth methods listed in the book. I think it helped to read the opinions of mothers who have experienced - good and bad - each birth method. It never felt that one method was being promoted over another.I am not due for several months, but assuming everything goes well, I feel more confident about the birth experience I want to have. And, thanks to this book, if it doesn't go according to my plan, as long as the baby is OK, I'll be OK with it!"
3,Great Introduction to all Birth Options,"""Deliver This!"" was an easy read that exposed me to the many various birthing options available to a pregnant woman today. I had an idea about most of them but this book provided me with some additional information from a non-prejudice point of view, as well as a few more details previously unknown to me.The best part of the book were the stories shared from other birth moms about their labor experience. I still want more, though. Upon finishing ""Deliver This!"" I did not feel that I had concrete information to choose the best birth option for me. Each birthing option chapter only seems to delve slightly into the facts, myths, and stories. I need more knowledge and facts before I can choose the option best for me. What I am able to do is exclude a few options from reading this book and then focus on the ones that interest me most."
5,No better way to break away with denial,"I'm 27 weeks pregnant with my first child, and in the last few months I read a lot about anything that has to do with pregnancy and child-bearing, but I stayed away from reading about, not to mention thinking about, delivery.. Since I got Deliver This!, though, I couldn't put it down, despite how tired and sleep-deprived I am.. and it was a great experience. I couldn't have asked for a better, gentler shattering of the walls of denial I built around myself..:) Beyond the practical advise, the clearly laid out information and the compassion towards all women and choices, I take with me the most powerful tool - humor. Don't get me wrong - I am still terrified, but the book empowered me to consider going natural, re-assured me it's ok to beg for the drugs, and all in all, just made me feel better about the whole thing. So thank you so much! what a great book!"
5,"Easy to read, simply step on the scale","This scale has large, red numbers and I find it easy to read. You simply step on the scale, no need to fiddle with any controls, and it displays the number after a few seconds."
3,THE SHINE OF A VERY YOUNG KATHARINE HEPBURN FILLS THE SCREEN,"""Alice Adams"" is one of those movies that rarely are made in Hollywood in these days, because the whole movie is carried by the performances and the direction. ""Alice Adams"" is a very honest and simple movie, its only pretension is to entertain the viewers, and this movie does that.In ""Alice Adams"" we can see a very young and charming Katharine Hepburn, she plays the role of Alice, she injected to the character freshness, sympathy and an aura of tenderness and innocence that rarely are seen in these days.""Alice Adams"" is a very amusing movie, specially if you are fan of the great Katharine Hepburn."
4,kate is great & so is most of the rest of the movie,"one of katharine hepburns signature performances, and deserevedly so, she stars in this adaptation of a booth tarkington novel about a young working class woman trying to push her way into ""high society"" (or what passes for that in provincial indiana). the movie sadly has to sidestep on the social satire (if it had been made 2 years earlier, i bet the ending would have been truer to life), but it still manages quite a few stings. and the set piece of the adams family formal dinner is a briiliantly directed stevens tour-de-force, highlighted by a hilarious turn (oh! that not-quite-starched cap, lol) from the sadly under-utilized hattie mcdaniel. still it is hepburns film, and her range of emotions here clearly go beyond ""A to B""."
4,Gets the job done,"Use them in the ""Cat Box Room."" works miracles for me. They last about a month. No complaints, just miracles."
2,Not Too Thrilled,"I first came across these in a hotel room where we had stayed. I ordered a number of them, but I can't say I'm that happy with them. The rooms I placed them in are just too large I guess. They are faily expensive, and they didn't last a month. I can't say I'd recommend them."
1,"Horrible smell, smell worse than my shoes","I purchased this lemon scent natural magic hoping it eliminate smell from my shoes closet. It turns out this thing smells worse than my shoes. There is some extremely strong odor that covers any smell, however i can't it and it makes me nausea,I highly do not recommend this if you want fresh smell at home."
4,Rod Piazza And The Mighty Flyers - Blues In 92,"Piazza's career has spanned 5 decades now and even today he remains a relevent force in the world of harmonica led blues. ""Alphabet Blues"" was released in 1992 and many long time fans consider it to be one of his best. All if the band's trademarks are here. Piazza's incredible harp playing and soulful singing. Miss Honey's outstanding boogie woogie piano, Alex Schultz always tasty guitar and the solid rhythm section of Bill Stuve and Jimi Bott. The album is anchored by one of Piazza's most popular numbers ""Blues In 92"" which he recently revisited on his most recent album ""Soul Monster"". Piazza and The Flyers are one of the rare blues bands that seem to be able to capture their live sound and energy in the studio. If you are looking to explore this band's back catalogue this one would be a great place to start."
1,Too lame for mystery fans and lesbian erotica readers BOTH!,"I liked the first book in the Nancy Clue series, because it parodied Nancy Drew AND had its sexy scenes, although even those were a bit overly tame. But this follow-up novel is so much duller, with NO erotica at all! Perhaps the author thinks by adding feminist psycho-babble she's produced a better book, but who reads these things for political awakening? Not me!!!"
4,WISH I COULD READ MORE,"I LOVE MABEL MANEY'S BOOKS SO MUCH, I WISH THAT THERE WERE ABOUT 30 OR 40 JUST LIKE THE REAL NACY DREW SERIES. MYSTERY, ROMANCE, & SEXY. SUPERB."
1,huge rip-off,"this is a rip off of johan gielen- beauty of silence and some other tracks, and some very cheesy lyrics and unoriginal beats, stay clear of this"
5,awesome shoes,"I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on, but i heard good things about this brand and model, so i gave it a shot, i have bad support in my feet and week ankles, these shoes look kinda big, but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support, and they lasted a very long time, i plan on making another order soon."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!,"Horible, I orderd these late december. two weeks later i get them in the mail. i got one size 13 and one size 10, how that happens i dont know, but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time. i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes. if i could punch someone threw a computer, it would be them!"
5,power of awsomenesss,"Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell. any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got. the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt. A lot! but all i do is spray Shout on them wait 5 minutes and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. but other than that they really have nice ankle protection, by the way there my first ankle tops i ever got and i am extremely glad i got them. i would and did recommend them to everyone. so get them the best 33 dollars i ever spent!"
2,''Very Disappointing '',"So I ordered these shoes, thinking they would look just like the picture. I was wrong, they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver. I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw. The shoes were not only the color I didn't want, but also HUGE,WIDE & not what I expected. They came in a nice box though, but besides that I would not Buy these. I was so disappointed & I paid $71.00 for these? There's So many shoes out there...that you can BUY for less..& look just as good. I shouldn't' have paid this much for these shoes.."
3,"Good shoe, but too expensive.","Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
5,Learned to read with this childhood favorite,"There must be something special about this book. Like many of the other reviewers, I also count this as my favorite book from childhood. I received it as a gift at age 5 and spent hours and hours reading and re-reading it day after day. In fact, I received it before I learned to read and remember struggling with words like ""enormous"" and ultimately teaching myself to read with this book. I haven't seen it in maybe 30 years, but I remember loving the illustrations, the sweet and imaginative story, and the interesting vocabulary. Seeing the picture of the cover here brought wonderful memories back to me. I'm so glad to see that it's at least available used."
5,For the Serious Connoisseur a Must-Buy,"This is not an album for pop-loving mellon brains! But if you are a hard-core collector/historian of classic rock, you can't pass this album up. It (along with Made in England) is Atomic Rooster's finest. Chris Farlowe's vocals roar with a soul deep down. Johnny Mandela's guitar-work is charged with Greek fire. Vincent Crane is as solid here as he ever was. Some may say this album is a departure from the regular sounds of Atomic Rooster, but I say this is the album where they found that exact mixture and finally gelled."
3,Kinda' sleazy,Skilled guitar scribbles on top of a few involved jams keeps this energetic blues-rock release from spilling into caricature.
1,Not helpful to understand the psychology of invention,It just talks about how great minds thought about their own thinking process and also about how the author thinks about psychology of invention. It does not help people like me who like to figure out how to become more creative and think more like a mathematician. The title of the book is misleading. It is even more misleading to note that this book is a very popular one. I do not understand why though.
3,"'Reggatta Mondatta' - Police Tribute,Volume 2 (Ark 21)","Personally,I liked Volume 1 a tad better.I never heard of most of these artists on here.I played this disc at a party recently and a few of the others that were present thought 'Reggatta...' was decent.Keep in mind that reggae isn't one of my favorite genres anyway.I took sort of a vote and a couple others tend to agree with me that the better cuts were ""So Lonely"" by Aswad,""Demolition Man"" by Rayvon(perhaps the best track)and ""De Do Do Do Do,De Da Da Da Da"" by Third World.See what you think.By the way,I've ALWAYS loved the Police."
3,Not nearly as good as the first one,"While a couple of tracks shine (Demolition Man, Rehumanize Yourself) others never get going. Classics like Bring on the Night just plod along.Unfortunately this album sounds like it was rushed out to take advantage of the success of the first (better produced) one."
4,A very satisfying film,"A very enjoyable film. It's both a comedy and a drama. Peter Sellers gives a wonderful performance which binds the film together. It was adapted from a play by Jean Anouilh (remember Becket?), and it's a very enjoyable film. But I have a single caveat - there are some early parts of the film where you may be disappointed by the dramatic nature of the plot, but if you just keep watching, you'll find a film that's both funny and moving - and there aren't many of those! I think the ending must be the most touching of any of Sellers' films."
4,Late period Shadows of Knight,"The original Shadows of Knight were an excellent mid-60's hard garage group, influenced by The Stones, Yardbirds, and Them, (from whom they derived their biggest hit, ""Gloria""). By the time of this 1969 album, the original group had broken up, and lead singer Jim Sohns assembled a new, heavy blues-rock outfit with excellent lead guitarist Woody Woodruff. The album has kind of a shizophrenic feel, as it alternates between bubblegum-ish pop and heavy guitar freak-outs (in the same song in the case of ""Times & Places""). There is some substandard material here, but some great tracks, such as ""Uncle Wiggley's Airship"" the infectious hit single ""Shake"" and an amazing feedback-drenched cover of Buffalo Springfield's ""Bluebird."" Worthwhile if you're a fan of 60's garage/psych and/or early hard rock/metal."
4,Probably their hottest album,"I guess you'd call this ""jump-blues"". Issued in 1991, but Amazon is still waiting for it to be issued. It is a theme album based on being on the road, all very hot blues. Each song tells a story with a subtle sense of humor, while staying within the strict rules of the blues. ""Do not disturb"" and ""Motel King"" lament the problems of motel living. ""Phonebill Blues"" is an x-wife's 3am call from L.A. to discuss her new beau (some relationships will not die). ""Mad 'bout Something"" sees James trying to dispell his girl's suspicions, but ""Stranger Blues"" is what sold me. A close rendition of a little-known Elmore James blues, harmonica/guitar lead to expand Elmore's original guitar and the sense of humor: ""A stranger ain't nothing but a friend that you don't know"". This is a hot Harman album with a small club feel. After his next album, ""Two Sides to Every Story"", he seems pressured to produce and his songs suffer. 1993 and earlier James Harman is always a very safe purchase!"
2,Sluggish Read,"This book was not fast paced at all. At times the technical descriptions were laborious and needlessly in-depth. Much of the story has the main character, Jake Grafton, a likable if predictable character, struggling with the meaning of life. Much angst over whether to stay in the service and whether or not to marry. At about a third of the way in I began skimming pages because the pace was so slow. The sidekick character, Flap LeBleu, was far more entertaining and would be a good main character. All in all, I was disappointed in this book. Far too little story hidden among technical descriptions as exciting as an owners manual and whiny self-absorbed introspective blather from Grafton. Hard core fans of the Grafton series may appreciate the character insights but the uninitiated will likely find this a boring travail."
3,The Intruders,The Intruders A good read and a lot to learn about the A 6 and those who flew them from ships.
3,The Intruders,"Okay, for someone who is very interested in the specifics of flying off a carrier, this might truly excite him (or her.) However, I'm afraid it's filled with interpersonal stuff that, frankly, I found rather boring. So be it! Charles Reap ReadAReap.Com"
2,seriously!?,The first half of this book read like a flight training manual. Way too much detail for a lay person. General knowledge would have done the job.
3,Inside the guts of the old aircraft carriers,"Grafton knows flying . He is an ex pilot that experienced aircraft carrier landings and knows the inner workings of carrier life and the navy back in the 70's. The detail of carrier ops then grabs your attention. The mental toughness of carrier pilots is fascinating. You get inside the minds of these heros and realize the pressure of getting it right. One wrong decision can cost you your life. The side plot romance is ok but not as interesting as the technical detail of Navy Operations. If you like historical detail of what life was like on carriers in the 70's and the men who risked their life on them, this is for you."
3,An OK read,"The Intruders is an easy read with quite a bit of action. I think you'd really enjoy it if you were, or have been, a military pilot. Coonts does a good job of describing the difficulties of flying on an off an aircraft carrier that I did find very interesting reading."
3,Great if you are thinking about becoming a carrier pilot,"Lots of technically oriented stuff about flying on and off aircraft carriers. Not much in the way of meaningful plots. A little love story and a brief adventure, but not up to others in this series"
1,Boring,"I got suckered into buying this book at a huge clearance sale. The picture of aircraft carrier and the blurb on the back attracted me. I like a good air war story once in a while (Blue Max or Piece of Cake remaining up there at the top). I quit reading after 160p of no plot, one dimensional characters, and boring simplistic conversation. I rate the book one star for its knowledgeable descriptions of airplane handling on an aircraft carrier."
2,A Clumsy Introduction to Jake Grafton,"Flying heroics by Jake Grafton, a Navy pilot on secondment to a Marine naval squadron. Many of the flying scenes are really gripping, but the book is filled with nut by nut descriptions of aircraft, steam launchers, landing techniques and you name it.After a while these lengthy narratives have you skipping to get to the next action or personal scene. Even his cynical Bombardier-Navigator is employed as a very obvious timeline to his acceptance in the squadron.Worth reading if you like technical detail, or are just a Jake Grafton fan, but as a coherent novel it is clumsy indeed."
4,Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!,"I bought this book, thinking it was a mystery. It isn't. It's about navy flying, and it is good. I don't fly, but I went to ground school and planned to get my license. This book was so instructive about flying off ships in all kinds of weather. The author has done a fine job with the narrative. The story is exciting and keeps you reading far into the night."
2,SHORT OF THE MARK,"NO REAL STORY LINE HERE. THE BOOK FELT DISJOINTED WITHOUT ANY REAL POINT. UPON FINISHING, I THOUGHT, ""WHY DID I WASTE MY MONEY"
3,The Intruders,I couldn't get into it it didn't catch my interest fast enough I guess so I put it aside and read something else
3,Its okay,"You have to want to be a navy pilot and know all the details of flying off a carrier. Story line is not bad, but way too much detail on mechanics of flying."
2,just too technical,"The adventure parts of this book are good, but there is way too much technical detail about flying off a carrier for the average reader."
4,Another new favorite author,"I am usually on the lookout for books that are hard to put down, and this is an author I will seek out again."
4,The Intruders,It is a very interesting book. It showed an amazing knowledge of subject matter and kept the story line going.
1,Boring,"This book was not at all what I expected. There is no plot here, just a lot of endless detail about flying. I forced myself to read the first 100 pages and now I give up. Huge disappointment."
2,too technical,Reading this book was like reading a technical manual about how to launch and retrieve a jet from an aircraft carrier.Long on tech and short on story.The title really throws you off. It has nothing to do with intruders.Steven Coonts really disappointed me on this one
1,What a ghastly novel...if you can call it that!,Ghastly. Baaad writing!!! I could do a lot better and I don't even pretend to be a writer!! I made it through about 30% of this book and finally gave up...it was that bad and I can usually read anything.
5,REALISTIC STORY,I HAD READ SEVERAL STEPHEN COONTS NOVELS AND HAD GREATLY ENJOYED ALL OF THEM. GOING BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF JAKE GRAFTON'S NAVAL CAREER HELPED TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE LATER NOVELS. STEPHEN COUNTS' EXPERIENCE AS A NAVAL AVIATOR MAKES JAKE GRAFTON A REAL PERSON.
5,"Realistic, Acurate Picture of our Young Naval Aviators","I've flown in the Intruder with pilots like Jake Grafton. He captures the spirit and mindset of these brave men. They are a breed apart from the rest of us. If you wonder what life is like aboard the modern aircraft carrier, this is as good a description as I've seen. Coonts incorprates yesterday's headlines with today's descriptions."
4,Worth reading,Decent back story. Testosterone filled post-Vietnam military. More than a few situations or statements that will cause a quick smile.
3,Good questions. No answers.,"Throughout this one, Jake struggles with the meaning of life and fatalism. Amazinginly (but not realistically) he manages to never even consider including God in this equation. Thus, by the end of the book he still has no answers to his questions. Plane after plane is dumped in the ocean - about half of them by Jake. Some good flight sequences in this one."
2,The Intruders: A Jake Grafton Novel by Stephen Coonts,The novel was mostly about flying a plane. As I have never had any flight training it was meaningless to me. Never finished it.
2,I can now fly a jet off of an aircraft carrier,"Please. This is a manual for flying jet plane off of a carrier. Or at least being a mechanic, or a controller, or -- you name it. Plot line so thing as to be nonexistent. I expected more from this as I have read some of the others. A great disappointment."
3,Goodbye is an unfortunate mish-mash,"I dig Goodbye, the new album by Dubstar. Unfortunately, that album is not the American release. It seems, due to Dubstar's first album (Disgraceful) not making it across the Atlantic, their American label thought it best to include some of those tracks on the new album (as well as some remixes). What this does, however, is break up the flow of both albums and water down the content of each one. If you're a Dubstar fan, I highly recommend acquiring the British versions of Disgraceful and Goodbye. While the US version is (I hate to admit it) a fine way to check out the band, I really do recommend buying the UK versions of both albums to get the full flavor of Dubstar's wonderful (sometimes haunting) pop. **** (4 stars) for UK/Goodbye/*** (3 stars) for US/Goodbye."
3,Dubstar - Goodbye,"Dubstar's second album, GOODBYE, has plenty of the synth-pop perkiness that marked their first, DISGRACEFUL. The singles ""I Will Be Your Girlfriend"" and ""Cathedral Park"" are immediately catchy, with the former's wittiness and the latter's horns, while ""No More Talk"" effectively conveys the weariness of love. But there are other surprises to be found as well: ""Polestar"" has a fascinating iciness to it and is much more ethereal than the rest of the album. But not all the tracks are successful: while ""It's Over"" goes for a sadder, moodier vibe, it doesn't quite make it. The second half of the album fades into twee pop, without the sparkle that makes each individual song stand out. While certainly pleasant, there's nothing that unexpectedly grabs your attention."
3,Some Good Stuff Here,"This is a strange album for me to listen to. Although the same elements are present on pretty much every song (female vocals, dreamy synths, club beats), the results vary quite a bit from song to song. ""Stars"" is easily the highlight for me - in both its original and ""Motiv 8 Mix"" versions. There the lyrics seem to fit better, the melody sounds better... All the pieces click in a few other tracks, as well, such as ""Not So Manic Now"". Elsewhere the lyrics sound rather clumsy (""No More Talk""), or the music isn't anything too special (""Just a Girl She Said"") - none of which leaves me cold, but it doesn't intrigue me any, either. I found as a whole this album works best as background music while working, although some tracks stand out as great singles."
3,Leaves you wanting more...or maybe less,"I wanted to like this album. The lead track ""Stars"" is great 90's Brit Pop, mixing dreamy synth and reverb with catchy sugar-coated lyrics. But like cotton candy, the first bite tastes the best. It's just too sweet, too bubbly. Even when the lyrics turn sour (""Talking is useless...""), Blackwell's incessently upbeat vocals lead you to believe that it's only because she'd rather be cuddling her teddy bear. Dubstar openly borrows from the shoegazer sound while forgoing the lyrical depth or introspection of the genre. It makes for an odd mix. Sort of Lush meets Swing Out Sister. To be fair, this is not a bad album. It is consistently listenable and gives the listener a fair idea of the music being made in the 90's. Better examples are The Sunday's ""Reading, Writing & Arithmetic"", Lush's ""Spooky"" and the Cocteau Twins' ""Heaven or Las Vegas""."
5,Great boot shipped on time.,"My son like the boot, it fit well and is water proof. We received the boot just a few days after ordering it."
3,Good deal,I got the boots for my grandson. They look and they are just what I was expecting. The only problem is I think the material is to hard. My grandson always complain that they hurt. We now is the right size and with and we are using the right socks to go with that kind of boots. For little sensitive feet they should be more flexible. Other than that I will say that I own a pair of timberland boot and I been very satisfy with them but for the little ones they are having a little hard time. Oh going further need to mention that the price was right!!
5,Love it,The waterproof boots perform perfect in snow days. Keep feet dry and warm. They also look good. I love it!
5,GREAT BUY!,I wear a 6.5 in kids and that's what i ordered. They seemed a little big when i first tried them on but theyre fine. I love my boots! great purchase! and they came fast!
3,boots,"These boots look very nice. The problem with them is they are made really big. I bought the size my son wears in other shoes, but these boots turned out to be quite larger than he needed. They make his feet look huge."
2,Toes lasted six weeks.,"I don't know if it's my nine year old grandson who lives with me or just a gliche with this pair of shoes. I purchased this shoe six or seven months ago for school purposes and the toes lasted 2 months. I gave it one more try but this time they lasted 6 weeks. I decided to pay for a more expensive boot because the cheap ones didn't last very long so I figured more money, longer lasting. I can't recomend these boots. Not after purchasing two pair.Twice poor Gramma from Murphys."
5,Bought these as a birthday present.,I bought these boots as a present for my son's fifth birthday. He had been asking for boots just like his daddy. The quality is great. Kids love these boots and they go with almost anything.
5,Whoa,I'm a size 8 1/2 in womans and I'm in love with these great fashion statement. Keeps my feet warmm
5,My Sons fave boot,My son knows that when he puts on these boots that he is dressing to impress! They have become an essential part of his wardrobe ever since he could walk handeling the weight of the boot! This is the first time I have ordered the boot without having to wait more then 2 weeks for it!
4,good quality/price,Those boots are very good quality. Very strong. Timberlands are large boots (impression) compairing to other shoes. The shoe sole is a little bit hard and not very flexibel.
5,TImberland boots,The boots are awesome...perfect just as they were stated to be. Arrived in a timely manner. We are very pleased with this product.
4,I love my boots,I do love my boots however they do run big so keep that in mind when you are purchasing a pair. Mine are too big but being the lazy person I am and knowing I bought them for winter I kept them because I can wear with thicker socks. Another complaint I have is that it took so long for them to ship off the boots like a full week for them to post as shipped. I'm use to it take two days at most. The shipping issue is why I give it four stars.
5,Great boot,My son wears these boots he had them for like two months and they still look new and the price was great saved lots of money
5,a superb album,"this album was a staple for me while doing just about anything! toe tappin', hand clappin', singin along with FUN music. i got all my buddies hooked on this unique, feel good music. if the band had as much fun making it(i think they did) as we all did listening & beating on anything to keep rhythm, then it was a great big whoop-up of a recording session. I WANT A CD! a real gem."
1,These scissors are pathetic,"OK -- I bought these because of the amazing reviews these were getting. Boy, am I disappointed. These didn't just break... they actually fell apart in my wife's hands. My wife wasn't doing anything particularly interesting with them when they fell apart. I don't think this would be so disappointing if they didn't fall apart within the first day of getting these. Get some Fiskars."
3,These scissors are so great.,"I just cut some plastic with them and then was all like, ""Damn... these sure are some scissors.""I keep them with my high-school football trophies and other special things (like my collection of vintage VCR remotes and betamax players)"
4,nice pair of scissors,these scissors appear to be pretty high quality...they are just a tad smaller than i expected (then my last pair)...
1,Broke Three In Quick Succession,"I bought three of these when I saw them in a local store, thinking them a great deal. They LOOK like the equivalent of the Henckels, solid and sturdy, at one-fifth the price. (At that time they only cost $5.69 each.)Looks can be deceiving.They are suitable for paper, skin, aluminum foil, etc., but do not try them on anything more substantial, like chicken leg bones. I broke these on items that I routinely cut through with my Henckels and Wusthof shears. The cost of sending them back under warranty was about the purchase cost, so I tossed out all three pairs.Sorry, Chicago Cutlery, but if you are selling office scissors, label them that way. I expect kitchen shears to be a LOT tougher. I can't mark these more than one star. Chicago Cutlery makes a pair of scissors called the Insignia series, for only about $2-3 more. I suggest potential buyers look into these, or spring for the more expensive German brands."

4,An informative case study,"It's very diversified as the author periodicly changes to the view and quotes of the involved persons. I read some true crime books in the past and most of them started to get pretty boring after 2/3 due to the describtion of the trial. The author Jack Olsen doesn't waste the readers time by dragin out the methodics of the lawyers. Instead you receive very interesting stories from different people with different points of view. And most important: you even start to think knowing Arthur Shawcross after a while. The only negative aspect I have to denounce is the ""impious"" -so to say -lack of any photographic material. The matter of the fact is; All sick puppies outthere, looking for these strange kind of literature about serial killers, HAVE to read this, guaran-damn-ted!"
4,Disturbing,"I found this book very disturbing and I have read many books on serial killers. I thought Arthur Shawcross was one of the most fascinating serial killers until I read this book. It is very well written and unfortunatley you get to know the families / friends of the victims which makes it very difficult to read without becoming emotional, especially concerning his child victims - God rest their souls - I take my hat off to Jack Olsen and the way he wrote a brilliant account, with victims and families in mind, of one very sick individual. Be ready to have your world rocked and faith in humanity almost lost. I will never read anything on Arthur Shawcross again - maybe this is in respect to his victims or just plain disgust with one man who was let loose on society thanks to an overcrowded prison system and parol officers who did not have enough information to make such a decision. You really feel for the victims in this one - very upsetting. A really, really good read."
4,Wealth of information for Chicago history buffs,"I'm an avowed Chicago history buff and found references in this book that simply cannot be found anywhere else. The bibliography alone has led to me several other books on the topic, which is appreciated. Really brought the city to life, and made you want to search out the street corners in question. I found myself asking older acquaintances if they ever met Richie Morrison.However I have to say the publishers did not do their job here. This book is poorly edited, suffering from simple errors such as misspellings (it's ward heeler, not ward healer), and in general confusing to those of us unfamiliar with the arcane characters filling the pages. I often found myself having to backtrack to figure out who the author was referring to -- a problem compounded by the numerous Irish names and confusing nomenclature."
4,Informative,"I love using Rough Guides and this was no exception. However I would've liked more info on cheaper restaurants, but I guess in a city like Toronto you can just walk a few steps and find a gem among the rocks.The information on places of interest was also quite good."
4,Have not used it much yet...but I am happy,"I purchased a lot of colognes all at once on Amazon, so I have not used this product much, but it seems nice. Obviously it will not be as glamorous or have the long lasting smell as a really expensive cologne, but for the price this is still a dynamite deal!!!!"

4,Smells Good.,"This product smells good, I would recommend it. The only downside to this product is that the scent doesn't last that long."
3,Not Bad,Not too bad. I tend to think all the Adidas cologne of this style smell really similar. It isn't a bad smell but its nothing special. For the price its not a bad buy....just don't purchase more then one of this style.
3,It's okay,"When i use cologne, I usually spray it on my clothes 2 to 3 times and it last for at least half the day... this one doesn't last long unless you spray yourself like 6 - 10 times. Like its been watered down. Other then that the fragrance is ok."
4,it's about time for a non-corporate sound,"In this day of corporate bureaucrats in which everybody has to be politically correct and conform to the norm, it is about time to listen to a thought-provoking, risk-taking album. You can tell immediately that this is on an indy label which makes it genuine. Instead of a corporate giant that is so worried about being sales driven from sound-scan, these guys sound very tight. You will love ""crash the company car"" which is how we all feel very often. They have a very original sound, and I have not had the opportunity to hear them live, but it appears that they sound like they have a lot of fun at a live concert. Give this a try- if you like the Replacements (reprise) or the Sand Rubies (polygram) then this is worth a try. Crank it in your car at 75-80 MPH. ENJOY !"
5,"Loud, fast and kick-donkey!",I had chance to see this three-man band live in San Francisco. I describe them as the Ramones meeting the Kinks. They had a good pace to the music- amusing lyrics and a solid sound that some bands seem to miss the hairs on their chinny-chin-chin! Highly recommended- escpecially if you come the generation of $5 shows that gave you twenty dollars of entertainment.
2,"""Why all the trouble reviews?"" Wait until you've owned it longer","We also bought this product after our first child was born and loved it at first. Now, only four years later, the screen is shot; we've received numerous error messages over the life of the product; we have three DVDs that we were able to review once before finanlyzing and now the camera no longer recognizes them; and Sony informs us that we must have it shipped to them for repair at a cost of $250.00. Extremely dissapointed that our camera is now premanently disabled after only four years and our only remedy is to pay $250.00 to hope that they can fix it."
2,"DVD Great, ImageMixer tough to learn","These are great for quick DVD renditions of home video, but a bit tougher if you have to spend time in the very-difficult-to-learn and use ImageMixer software. If all you want is to shoot your home movies and make a DVD really fast, this is the camera for you. Great lens, great machine, lousy lousy software. ImageMixer (Pixela) support was very good, but the software leaves a lot to be desired. This camera is not compatible with the MAC platform, a real shame."
5,A Brilliant Must Read For Anyone Who Likes Formula One,The Autocourse series is by far the best I've ever seen written of Formula One. I've devoured several years of Autocourse and will read it for a very long time.
5,Great stuff!!,Crosby just doesn't get it. Maria is at her best and the best of the genre her in her swamp blues here. Great stuff. Her other recordings over the five years since don't hold a candle to this one. Telarc should be so lucky as to get her to sound this good again. I wish they could. She did in live performance last year.
3,Love Call,This cd was alright.It could have been better.Songs were well written but not my kind of music.Be careful with this one.
5,When Boxing&Fundamentals Mattered,this is the Kind of Boxing Match that many Fighters now&ahead should watch.this shows the Complex&Chess like Vibe involved in Boxing.Ali used Rope a Dope to Defeat Foreman something that many a Fighter wouldn't dare do.because with the Power of Forman's Punches chances are they would have been knocked thru the Ropes.Ali made a Major Statement with this Fight that Forever Crowned Him into His Legacy.You gotta See it what a time Period&Fight.
5,THE GREATEST!,Rumble In The Jungle -Ali vs Foreman 1974 VHS was a gift for my hubby.He had an old one and it got borrowed and was lost.Woes from my hubby had me scrambling to find a replacement. This was part of a trilogy of Ali fights he owned.He was sure this Rumble was lost to him forever.LOL.(he probably wore the old one out by watching it so much)~~~~~This copy contains so much more than his original.This is definitely a keeper..The Greatest! Thank you Amazon.com...........I know the place to go for any lost items such as this.
1,Beware of the description! This is NOT a RAID controller.,"The description for this item (as of 7/21/05) is incorrect, according to Promise Technology's web site (which I really should have checked before I ordered this card and tried to install it), this card only functions as a PCI to ATA 2 channel controller, it has no RAID functionality whatsoever. The descrptions of RAID functions seem to be describing the Promise Technology Fasttrack 100TX2 card. I've notified Amazon about this error, and if they change the description thus saving others from the aggrivation I had, then kindly ignore this review."
3,Simply put; more bomb than squad,"The rundown is mediocre acting, for a cast that doesn't have much star power. Sound Mixing was a bit off, and at times threw me out of the element. The graphics though, for an indie film, were phenomenal. I expected the look of this film to be pretty bad, but it exceeded my expectation. The story has been done before, but you can't blame indie filmmakers trying to get some work done. Bomb squad is more of a bomb, that lacks a lot of squad (the pieces that would make this film as a whole, a good one).I recommend streaming and not buying. You might start a riot for those 14 bucks back when you can be satisfied for 3 dollars and see it once."
2,Not real impressed,The lid is welded on at an angle so it doesn't fit quite right. Just not impressed with the quality.
5,Up In Downtown is AWESOME!!!!,The songs on this CD are great because each has its own sound and there is something for everyone--especially if you listen for the hidden track. This is the best music I've heard in a long time.
1,Fun with Tangrams Kit,"This is an extremely disappointing product. I ordered several- one for my daughter (age 7) and extras for small birthday presents to take advantage of the free shipping rate. The tangrams shapes are to proper scale, but the puzzles are very small and unusable with the size if the tangrams. You would need to enlarge the puzzles in order to use them. Now, in order to return the unusable product, I have to forgo the free shipping rate and pay to return them. I would advise to NOT waste your time and money on this product."
2,Flimsy Pieces,"The patterns are great in this book, but the puzzle shape pieces are made of lightweight cardstock; not very durable or easy to use for children. We ended up ""laminating"" our pieces with clear packing tape to make them last longer and prevent bending, tearing, etc. Next time I purchase a book like this, I will look for one with plastic or wooden pieces."
2,Show and tell book no insight,I bought this book with the expectation that the author would be able to provide some insight. I was wrong. This books does explain Concepts and Example of DW. This books is good if your just getting into DW. It would better to download the Oracle Concepts Guide and the DW Guide.
2,A boring mix of pop art and the classics.,"Although this book earned the Seix Barral award, it is poor compared to other works of Fuentes. A failed attempt to make a novel with many significant levels. A lenguage experiment that results awful. It might have been interesting in the sixties, but thirty years later is not worth it. A novel that won't stand the test of times."
1,Apparently Men Don't Need to Be Honest,"I perused this book which belongs to a family member. It's an LDS version of the Dale Carnegie classic ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"". In 1991 an investigation by an Arizona Republic reporter determined that Paul H. Dunn had made up many of his personal accounts of bravery, fame, and spiritual experiences. Dunn admitted he had lied and apologized. In light of that 1991 revelation it came as no surprise that honesty is not listed as one of the traits of The Ten Most Wanted Men."
2,Not so super sticky!,"I was hoping that I could stick these on my moving boxes to organize our belongings but alas, these are not sticky enough to stay on the outside of the box so I'm having to tape them on with packing tape. If you were just using these on paper, they would be fine."
4,Interesting for Buddhist fans,This book is recommended for those who want to get more knowhow on tibet buddhism termas. This book is not for beginners...
1,Sorry -- can't tell you....................,"I ordered this Plastikote 200 Chevrolet Orange engine enamel -- but unfortunately, what I received was Rustoleum instead...........'nuff said. I will say that the distributor (Deerso) was great about it, and appologized, issuing me a full refund. So you may want to get in touch with them prior to ordering.....since they were supposedly unaware that ""their"" distributor changed the product on them and didn't tell them............this should not be advertised by Amazon if it is not available............."
1,not recommended,"A very aggravating movie experience, with no redeeming aspects. Flawed in setting and details, mediocre in acting and cinematography, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste."
5,Super battery!!,This is the holy grail of add-ons. Battery life becomes a 'non-issue' .. and it is not 'uncomfortably large' for the camera either.
1,Item from PERIDIGM is COUNTERFEIT!!!,"The reason this item from Peridigm is so much cheaper is because it is counterfeit. The packaging looks legitimate, it even has a hologram, but when you go to open the plastic clam shell packaging, it opens easily without scissors and the plastic is much thinner. The Sony logo uses a slightly different font in a slightly different color. If I didn't have 8 others, I wouldn't have known. Putting it up next to my legitimate ones, it's easy to spot the fake. The real giveaway was when my Sony battery charger refused to charge it and my Sony camcorder wouldn't recognize it and refused to power on. Fortunately Amazon didn't have any problem giving me a refund. I will be spending a little extra and buying from a reputable company like BH."
1,FAKE!,The battery lasts about 1/2 hour. Please do not waste your money with these people as this is definitely a counterfeit battery.
1,What a DEADBEAT!!!!,"The battery looks genuinely good, and came on time, as advertised. Unfortunately that's about all the POSITIVES I have for this product. I bought 2. One would not fully charge and lasted all of 10 minutes. The other charged pretty well, an hour or so for what my charger indicated was good for about 10 hours of use. Everything seemed normal during shooting and then the battery just inexplicably conked out after 30 minutes. Zalapini sent me a replacement and guess what? No good either. Don't be deceived by the looks of these batteries. They're impostors!!!!"
2,Slaughterhouse Five,Slaughterhouse Five is an intersting book which gives science fiction a neat twist. The plot is very hard to follow because of the main characters time traveling. This stream of consiousness book makes you think about life now and after death. But if you are looking for a no brainer easy read this is not the book for you.
2,Overrated,"Wow. Could somebody get this guy an editor? And maybe a dictionary, so he can look up the word cloying? So it goes."
3,fresh concepts but boringboringboring,"Maybe its the concept of predestination or Vonneguts use of black humor thats got the critics heads turning, but when you want to just READ an enjoyable book, this just doesnt come close. It's not a horribly BAD book, but unless you're reading it for english class or something, I suggest you pass"
5,Fantastic!,"I hate war books. But this is not a war book, or at least it is not what I envision as a war book. It was a fascinating journey through the mind of a war victum. I can't believe it took me three years to finally get around to reading this one!"
5,The finest anti war book ever written,"Vonnegut shows us through expanded fiction that war does not only harm those that it injures in present time. Billy Pilgrim lives or should I say lived everyday, trapped in his dream world, a world he constructs to rationalized the bombing and killing that took place in Dresden. And so it goes."
4,Extrodinary book from an extrodinary author,"I actually read it a year ago, but I remember what a great book it was. Of course, Kurt Vonnegut has an extrodinarily abstract mind, and it takes a similar person to follow this story. If your one that likes a traditional storyline with a start, middle, then end, then this is not the book for you. Instead this book jumps all over the place from pas,t to present, to future, to alien worlds, to World War II, to a regular house. I personally LOVED his interpretation of alien life and I think he does an extrodinary job describing certain theorys that I previously thought were inconceivable. Kurt Vonnegut has a wonderful way with words and I definatly recommend this book to the open-minded. -Tyler DeLisle"
2,not a fun read,"being dyslexic does not provide me with the time and patience to read a book like this. If I'm going to put so much time and effort into reading a book it should be worth it. this book was not worth it. i think there was only 2 sentences in the book i enjoyed reading. the rest of the book was just randomly weird(not cool weird), unentertaining, and the characters weren't so relatable. the general story was really boring and dry. I think the only reason why people read this book is because the famous author. i gave this 2 stars just because those 2 sentences at the beginning of the book i liked were really good. other then that...it sucked.Reading this book was like eating stale tasteless bread. But If you like that, then hey, go for it."
1,I don't get it and was hard to swallow,"This was sooo boring and the worst book I have ever read. I really had a hard time getting through this book. It dragged, went back and forth, & bounced around. I really don't understand why this was well received by some but I guess everyone is entitled to their opinions."
4,A comedic classic with a message,"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade is a witty, comedic, yet sad satire of war. The story follows Billy Pilgrim during World War II, as he becomes ""unstuck in time"". His life jumps around; he is able to see his death but not be dead and relive moments of his past and experience moments of his future long before they take place. Some of those moments include his experience in World War II, the bombing of Dresden, and living on the distant planet Tralfamadore - yes, that is correct. Vonnegut blends science fiction into his anti-war satire. The result is a highly entertaining read, with moments of comedic bliss quickly followed by sad futility on an insight into humanity (and Tralfmadorianity)."
2,Slaughterhouse Five,I read this book because it's labeled as such a classic. It was an interesting book but I found it to be highly overrated.After thinking about the book some more I decided that it's an interesting commentary on a war culture. We as a world haven't experienced war and death on the level of the world wars in a long time. After trying to view the book from that point of view I can see it as an interesting view on the nature of death.
4,SL-5,"In Slaughter House Five, Kurt Vonnegut writes about Billy Pilgrim's adventure through war, time travel, and life in the end. Vonnegut is able to write well because of experience from writing many other books.Vonnegut's main point is that war is bad because things die from it. He does an excellent job of proving his point, by having an enourmous amount of objects and characters die. He reminds you of how much death there is by adding the short phrase ""So it goes."" after every death.Vonnegut is saying something by having aliens in his story. The aliens teach him to take time in one chunk, instead of dividing it with different events.Slaughter House Five can be compared easily with Catch-22. Catch-22 is also an anti-war book, and shows downsides of war. People die, go crazy, and hate war in both. Both books use a lot of humor.The book was not written in any order. It may confuse some people. Adventurous readers may like this, for a challenge."
4,History and wierdness intertwined into a story of genious,"Vonnegut truely out did himself in this story, delivering a tale revealing the effects of war on society, individuals and family. It taught me a lot about the end of the second world war as the story is partiallly placed in Dresden before, during and after its bombing and placed on another planet-according to the protagonist, who can travel through time-where aliens put him in an inhuman zoo with a female of our species. It is original, funny, depressing and uplifting. A work of imagination and much thought, as it is an American classic. I am looking forward to reading more from Vonnedut."
3,Interesting,This was a truly interesting book. I enjoyed reading it and it made me look at things differently. A very interesting book
1,Horrible,"Don't waste your money on this book. I wish I had saved my money! I will not recommend this book to anyone, ever!"
3,Slaughter House Five,It bounced off the walls a bit going from one subject area to the other. A bit hard to follow at times.
3,"good book, but not really what was advertised","The book itself is really good. The condition wasn't the best, but it was advertised that way. I did think it was weird that there was no dust cover. If you want a collector copy, this probably isn't what you want."
2,not as I remember it,"I rember this book from high school being a good book, now i found it to be pretty silly, if you like this kind of story its ok"
4,Hard Hitting,"I've gone a long time without reading any of Kurt Vonnegut's novels and this is now the second I've read. War from the perspective of the little guy and without the ""I won the war"" bravado of so many novels of this class."
3,Slaughterhouse 5,The book was ok. The only difficulties I had was the way Vonnegut wrote this book. He practically went in circles. The only thing I would change to this book would be to make it more linear
4,Interesting If You Understand It,Read it several times and saw the old movie based on this book because the idea of time being a curved line and not a straight one is a very interesting idea.
3,brilliant but not my cup of tea,"This book has been hanging out on the outer circles of my ""classics to read one day"" list and I finally decided to give it a try because it's so short. I read the first several pages in the store and found it the most interesting of the books I was considering buying. That being said I was glad it was short and I could finish it quickly. I can see the reasons why it's considered a classic, but I just didn't find it very interesting. The irony and fatalistic spirit are indeed darkly humorous. For three quarters of the book, I couldn't help but chuckle at the line ""So it goes"", but I did get tired of that too by the end. There were some absolutely brilliant sentences. Some of the vignettes held absolutely amazing ideas that would be fun to develop into a full novel."
2,No Cat's Cradle,"This is my third Vonnegut book. The first I read was Cat's Cradle, which to this day is my second favorite book (after Catch-22). I then tried Breakfast of Champions, which I strongly disliked. I was hoping this book would be more like Cat's Cradle, but I'm now halfway through and it reads exactly like Breakfast of Champions (although thankfully, there are no drawings). If you enjoyed Breakfast of Champions you will probably also enjoy Slaughterhouse Five."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Vonnegut has written an anti-war book, but he has done it with somestyle. It is perhaps hard to find humor when you are being blown tohell and back, but through characters in this novel he manages to doso. Darkly amusing, I suppose is what you would call it at times. Oneway to view the Allied bombing of Dresden, anyway."
4,Slaughterhouse-Five,"Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut ****Long concidered to be Vonnegut's classic and best work as an author...I strongly disagree. This is far from his worst work but it doesn't hold a candle toBreakfast of ChampionsorCat's Cradle.The satire here is great. The commentary on War and what it does to those involved and those around them. Written about his own service in World War II and his own tribulations of being there and what it caused him afterward only done Kerouac style through fiction. It doesn't always work however.Often times the plot falters and feels boring. Readers will have trouble finishing the book if not familiar with Vonneguts work, but what saves it from being average is his over the top since of humour.What it offers a look into is brilliant but it doesn't always deliver, and for that it can never be a five star read."
3,"Like Ohio State football, this book is overrated.","This book is overrated. Although it is interesting and I couldn't put it down, I found that its standing as a perennial anti-war book is undeserved. Sledge, in With the Old Breed, had a more profound impact on my understanding of the destruction, horror, and sense of helplessness and despair in war."
5,A story with a conscience,"Kurt Vonnegut is, I'm told, a pacifist. While there are elements of pacifism that make terrific sense to me, I'm not sure I completely join him in this particular conviction. In Slaughterhouse Five, however, he makes a brilliant case for his position.Slaughterhouse Five is about war. And tragedy. And laughter. And aliens. It's not really a true story, but it's set in a true piece of history... the infamous firebombing of Dresden in the final months of World War II. Vonnegut draws on his own, true experiences as a soldier in Dresden to inform the fiction.While Vonnegut is famous for his sense of humor, that wasn't what was most impressive to me about this particular work. I appreciated this book because it has a conscience. While many authors are content to woo or shock or report, Vonnegut feels a deep sense of responsibility to his audience to not only tell the story... but to wrestle with the questions of time and mortality with his readers."
3,Uncertain journey,"A symbolic meat locker kept Kurt Vonnegut alive during the fire bombing of Dresden in WWII, however, it seemed to kill his imaginative character Billy Pilgrim who he met there. The war left the protagonist, Billy, as a shell shocked victom whose imagination will take the reader on a joy ride through time and space. He displays many symptoms of an individual with mental issues, but the realistic interpretations of his time traveling and the adoption of new alienistic beliefs leave the reader with constant questions regarding his mental state. ""Possibly, he may not be insane, maybe he is absolutely correct"", are some of the things you may ask yourself when reading Kurt Vonneguts interesting novel. This book has facts throughout but, most of the book is Sci-fi and wierdly interpreted. Its a great book to just sit back and let your mind be open too...."
2,Silly,Not a fan. I read this a long time ago and forgot how disjointed it is. Vonnegut does not hold up very well.
3,Didn't exactly live up to the hype - unfortunately,"I really loved the writer's style and his wry sense of humor- and it was an enjoyable story. I just felt it was a little too vague and disjointed and left me feeling just mildly irritated that there was no cohesive explanation or ending - and yet ashamed to admit it because this book is a ""Classic"" and my admittance that I didn't really care for it will just be viewed as my admiitance to being too dense or not sensitive enough to the subtle nuances of blah blah blah. It didn't really move me. I just spent the entire book trying to determine whether Billy Pilgrim was actually time traveling or insane."
5,Bizzare yet equally engrossing and enjoyable,"Slaughterhouse Five is now one of my favorite books upon finishing it. The book's narrative is very unique as it frequently jumps from one event to another as it chronicles the events of Billy Pilgrim's life before and after his experience in Dresden in WW2. The book is very entertaining and funny yet also sad and thought provoking all at the same time.Some readers may get confused with the non-linear storytelling but the book isn't very long and the events are very detailed and unforgettable.I also admire how Vonnegut described wartime conditions, soldiers did not always have adequate equipment and weapons and being a prisoner of war and forced into labor for you're enemies is not fun and serves as a good anti-war story.i recommend this to anyone especially now when America is at war in the middle east and some people may change their minds about the perceptions of war as it changed mine."
1,PAPERBACK GLUED TO A HARDCOVER,"I've yet to read the novel, but had to return THIS edition. It's a Dell mass market paperback glued into a hard cover. If that's all you need, that's fine, but I'd never seen anything quite like it."
2,A very weird story,"I didn't like this book at all. First of all, I beleive Vonnegut is a sicko. He writes about things that are so outrageous. The flashbacks did bother me some, and Billy Pilgrim, in my opinion is a loony. I had to read this in my English class and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I despise books about war and the loss of the mind, while people travel in time to the planet of Tralmafadore...very strange novel...I would have given it a one, but I have to admit that it wasn't too boring and was not slow at all."
4,Slaughterhouse-Five,"Very interesting - need to read again. Not sure what the goal of the author was. Enjoyed the ending more than the first, because it directly dealt with the bombing of Dresden. I need to re-read, because I am certain I missed much of the message - there is more there than I read. Writing was creative - but seemed flat - and I suspect for a reason. Need to re-read."
5,"A true depiction of the ""romance"" of war","Kurt Vonnegut was there. Through his experiences we ought to learn that war isn't like what we see on John Wayne. War is the worst thing imaginable. Your friends die, loved ones fear for you. I'm a veteran myself, and believe me, it isn't glamorous. Necessary, sometimes, but never ever glamorous. There is a Billy Pilgrim in us all, and I look forward to becoming unstuck in time as he was."
5,"Beautiful, serenely beautiful","Beautiful, beautiful. In words, ideas, in character, sad, pensive, beautiful. Billy Pilgrim is the aloof soundboard through which the readers uniquely experience (and Vonnegut expresses) the firebombing of Dresden and the comical tragedies of war.I repeated the word ""beautiful"" because Vonnegut's diction is so simple and transparent like a clear crystal. He has a gift for depicting the fantastic with what is fantastic. For instance, the implicit tragedy of horrendous Dresden burning is counterbalanced by the preceding hilarity of English prisoners of war, and the fantastical abduction of Billy by aliens. Yet, uses the resulting mental jolts to emphasize the tragedy of the war, rather than debase the topic into a light farce."
3,Didn't affect me the way it obviously does some people,"Billy Pilgrim is a man who witnessed the firebombing of Dresden during World War II where he was a POW. Later in life he believes he was abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. Sometime after this he became unstuck in time, constantly shifting from one time period of his life to another. One minute he is in the POW camp, and the next he is on Tralfamadore and the next at home with his wife. Slaughterhouse Five is filled with absurd images and people and speaks to how we handle traumatizing events in our lives. It is an oddly structured book in that there is no real beginning, middle or end and constantly jumps around in time and place. It is worthwhile to read this book for its absurd humor and deft characterization of Billy Pilgrim, but it does not strike me as the iconic classic it is made out to be."
3,3 Star classic,"Sorry folks. not a big deal here. 3 star on yet another so called brilliant ""classic"". Thematic parts are good but the main character ""billy pilgrim"" is boring and this book doesnt seem to be going anywhere even when giving respect to the story and those who perished in Dresden..then it ends. Nothing earth shaking happens in this book in theme, style or story."
2,Dated,At my age (60) I have outgrown this type of stream of conscience anti-war pulp. Would have enjoyed it back aound the early 70s with a little dope.
3,Better when you're young and naive,"I have to admit that it is not the same book this thirty-nine-year-old remembers when he read it last at nineteen. Parts of it are brilliant, but I found myself rolling my eyes at the sidetrips to Tralfamadore and his juvenile asides about sex. A review I recently read gets it right:""I suppose that once upon a time, this novel must have seemed terribly arch or ironic. Perhaps it is simply a function of living in the Decade of Irony, but now it just seems fairly sophomoric.""Now I'm afraid to read any more Vonnegut for fear of slapping myself silly for being such an impressionable college boy."
2,And so it goes.... to the goodwill in town.,"This book was something that I missed out on when in high school. Now that I have summers off I thought I would go back and read a classic. And so it goes. Well, I will tell you that I was disappointed. I mean how could it be that I just did not see why others have so cherished about this book. I guess it was that its anti-war theme was so pedestrian that it was rather boring. Truly, boring. Maybe he was the first to do this without the over the top deep thinking, but at this point it was plain boring. It is easy to read and understand, but the aliens and flashbacks, ruined it for me. And so it goes. I just did not enjoy this book and felt as though I was cheated. The aliens were just too much. Oh well, this is the price I pay for being a scientist."
5,Deeply affecting,"This is a really powerful book. I truly loved the story, the characters, the structure, the wording --everything. That said, I think it should be noted that this is a particularly dark book for Vonnegut. I felt sad for hours after reading it. Not really one for the beach."
4,"First Vonnegut book I've read, and I'm generally impressed.","This is the first book I've read by Vonnegut. I picked it up mostly because it was there, and I had vaguely heard of it before. Normally, I don't like stuff that talks about aliens and other planets and such. But I managed to overcome that prejudice here (really only a fraction of this book is science fiction anyway). While so much science fiction is an escape to a false reality, this book speaks the truth about the real world. This book is full of truths. But you should discover them yourself. Vonnegut has something important to say, and he says it well. Can't ask for much more than that."
4,"Billy Pilgram's odyssey though a ""fractured life"" duringWWII","Billy Pilgram, Kilgore Trout and Montana Wildhack are unfogettable characters. The Tralfamadorians really know that no one ever dies they just appear dead but are living in time forever. Vonnegut you are the man. So it goes."
2,Genius or Neurosis?,"I found myself wanting to understand more about what the main character thought about the war, about the people in the war, about his relationship with his wife and kids, etc. But he seemed to think nothing at all. Billy was simply be a pawn in someone elses game, always. That's pathetic, depressing, and disturbing. I fault the author and his main character with not taking any responsability for anything. NO, we are not just pawns. We do have some control over our lives and our fates are not pre-known (we do not jump around in time so we have no idea what is going to happen to us in the future). But if you do nothing to take control of your life, you can be sure that others will take control of it for you...."
1,Awful,"I don't know what I was thinking when I started this book. I had heard it was strange, and it is definitely that, but I guess I expected more from all that I had heard. It was almost as if it was strange just for the sake of being strange. Billy Pilgrim was insipid and stupid. I saw no point in his being ""unstuck"" in time and the addition of the Tralfamadorians.I have often heard this book compared to Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. Know I will cringe whenever I hear that. The only similarity between the two is that they are about WWII. Catch-22 is a good book that uses hyperbole and silliness successfully. Slaughterhouse-five is just inane."
2,Questionable content for teens,"This book was required reading for my teen. Although the book may have literary merit I found references to bestiality, torture and gore inappropriate for a required book."
1,Say What?,"This book has been on my TBR list for a while, but I just recently got around to reading it. Now I'm wondering what all the hype is about.Slaughterhouse is marketed as an anti-war novel. Honestly, I don't see the point. The book is basically a disjointed narrative that follows Billy Pilgrim, a man unstuck in time.Much like The Time-Traveler's Wife, this book follows the main character as he hops through time. The problem with this book however is that there is nothing to tie the time lines together. There is no stability, just a jump from one time to another, to another, to another, and so it goes.Then the narrative ""jumps the shark"" by sending Billy not just through time, but space- to an alien planet in outer space.I can't see where the anti-war theme emerged or made a prominent statement. To me it just seems like an ad ploy to sell another book"
2,expected more.,"after reading cat's cradle and especially sirens of titan, i was expecting to love slaughter house 5. Instead i was basically disappointed. it just seemed to be a rehashing of other ideas, and just when the book started to grow on me and really pull me in, it would loose it's focus and my interest would be gone again. i came into this book expecting so much and came out with so little."
2,Keep your expectations low,"When people have raved about a film that was produced by someone who you think you would enjoy, but it just falls flat; it is partly due to the execution and partly due to the expectations. This novel left me feeling the exact same way. The whole time I kept thinking if I just get through this next chapter I am sure I will begin to see the magic. Never happened. The few pages he actually spent on the war were excellent. The dull sci-fi story that takes up the vast majority of the book were not. I am glad that I have read it, just so I can warn others simply to not get their hopes up. Then perhaps they can get more out of it than I did."
4,"Not Vonnegut's best, but still amazing","While not Vonnegut's funniest, or even most poignant, ""Slaughter House Five"" points out the absurdity of war effectively. As everyone points out, it is similar in nature to Catch-22, but only in that it conveys its message in an unorthodoxed manner. To condemn this book because it's ""Anti-war"" is absolutely ridiculous. Vonnegut shows us that the bombing of millions of INNOCENT human beings is truely horrific and inexcusable. As the victors, we (Americans) tend to ignore the less than dubious actions taken by our side. Sure, right is served, but at what cost? Do we not become the same monsters which we are ""valiantly"" trying to defeat? Are the millions dead in Dresden and in Hiroshima no less innocent than the millions killed in concentration camps? That is the question Vonnegut wants to ask. Read it... it will make you laugh, it will make you sad, and more importantly, it will make you THINK."
5,Astonishingly creative......,"I never read Kurt Vonneguht before and, thus, had no idea what to expect from his book. Through the first few chapters I was a little confused to where he was taking this book; especially since it was said to be loosely based on his own experiences during World War 2. Kurt forced the reader to deal with the fantastic reality, that one could only view as absolute humor, and forced us also to deal with the harshness of life and death and the fine line between them. He intertwined the two and created a character whom was eternally trapped re-living his War days and the time when he was abducted to the planet Tramalfagador ( I probably spelled that wrong ). One cannot completely overlook the meaning of the ""imaginary"" world....because who is to say what is reality and what is not....I certainly dare not impose my opinion; figure it out for yourself."
5,A master at play,"At random points in time I still think of Billy Pilgrim. Obviously, I have never been to war, but this book, more than other war experience books I've read, is the one I feel has best helped me imagine and understand the personal and psychological effects of what it must be like to be a veteran. I'm sure I can't understand it truly, not having experienced it, but there is something about the way Vonnegut wrote Billy Pilgrim that makes me feel like I connect to the madness. There is a passage in this book where Billy Pilgrim envisions a war documentary in reverse, with bombs being sucked out of the sky and the world being repaired, and I don't think any passage from any book has had a more immediate and profound impact on me than that one."
4,War time timewarp.,"A 2006 Summer Reading List - Mini ReviewKurt Vonnegut experienced the atrocities of the fire bombing of Dresden in World War II. He was sheltered in Slaughterhouse-Five (A meat processing plant) during the assault. In the same way I and all his other readers experience The Dresden Bombing, WWII and the surreal in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five.Billy Pilgrim is the main character an aptly name observer of the human condition. Vonnegut takes his subject seriously by not taking his subject seriously. The book is a crazy jumble of Pilgrim's travels in war, space, and time. It does not hit you immediately, but amid the craziness, Vonnegut is making solid points about the absurdity of war.This is a funny and thought provoking book worth several readings."
5,Unique,"The story itself was great. But what made it great was Vonnegut's writing style. He takes a man's life, spread out the events of his life like a deck of cards, then shuffles the cards, and spreads them out again. At first it is confusing, but once you catch on, it is a magnificent journey.But beware. This isn't a straight, WWII book. You have to have a little taste for science fiction. And a sense of humor."
2,Book not what I expected,"Slaughterhouse- Five by Kurt Vonnegut,his writing style is unique, it leaves me cold. I am sure I am missing something but cannot identify it."
5,So it goes,"This is a fantastic book, one of the best I have ever read (it is also by a considerable distance Vonnegut's best).As usual for Vonnegut the book is basically an exposition of his psyche. This time combining large themes WWII, the bombing of Dresden, inevitability, time travel and a non-linear existence to produce a truly compelling book.Some will dislike Vonnegut's idiosyncratic prose and his tendency towards flippancy. Personally, I find his prose engaging and entertaining - he is capable to conjuring up quite vivid imagery, and being funny and moving (often at the same time).This book contains a couple of my favourite moments - the wonderful image of the planes flying backwards over Dresden and restoring it (how I wish Martin Amis had never read it - maybe he wouldn't have written Time's Arrow) and the idea that he would keep returning to his favourite moment - sitting on the back of a hay wagon in Dresden.Read it!"
4,Good for an older man,"I don't feel like I got into this one as much. Lots of fun as far as Vonnegut's well-known writing style, and just as far out. I think the book will hold more meaning to me as I get older."
5,Bet the House on this One,"Kurt Vonnegut does what so few other modern authors are able to: create important yet easily consumed literature. The latter half of the 20th century was far from the golden age of books with most novels written falling into the category that I kindly label ""Pulp."" In short, John Grisham, Tom Clancy, and the like are not changing the way we think. Vonnegut, in contrast is. This dryly witty commentary on war actually means something. Its about violence, its about inter personal relationships, its about the way we think and act as human beings and animals. These themes are sometimes hard to spot but the text is never hard to handle. The books is not long winded and it reads quickly. A perfect fit for a first time Vonnegut reader or anyone who was born with even the smallest cynical streak."
5,Vonnegut was a God of Literature,And I am humbled every time I read him. My back is bowed from too much bowing in reverence.
3,Who's Bright Idea Was It For The Book Reader To Whisper?,"This isn't a review of the book so much as of this CD version. If you, like me, listen to books on CD in your car, you may not like Ethan Hawke's style here. I didn't. He whispers, or nearly whispers the whole book. I had to turn the volume WAY up to hear, which was distracting. Maybe someone thought that conveyed the tone of the book, but at times it was like a bad Jack Nicholson impression.The book itself is fine and worth your time."
3,Slaughterhouse-Five,"It is not my usual stuff but it had some interesting ideas. I have to admit though that I checked out the Spark Notes just to make sure I was keeping up with everything. The ""getting unstuck"" and traveling back and forth through time was a bit nerve racking but in the end, I understood why he did it. At least I think I do. Either Vonnegut is a literary genius or a complete fool. Judging from his popularity though I am going to say that it is the former. If not, we are all the latter."
3,I was looking for something more,"I was left disappointed by Slaughterhouse-five. I see the creativity no doubt, and I also see the ease at which it reads. What I don't see is a top 20 of all time science fiction books. This book as it is is borderline science fiction at all. What Kurt calls time travel is only Billy Pilgrim remembering the past. Obviously his abduction by aliens was a result of his skull being fractured.I am just amazed that over 400 reviews of this book give it a 5 star rating. It just isn't that good plain and simple. Kurt has the ability to tell a story but this one just doesn't work. Too much reminiscent jumping and not enough science fiction. The satire falls empty and has no teeth. I would have given this book a 2 star rating if not for the unique writing style utilized by Kurt.Definitely a passerby and not worth the reading. Save your eyes for something else."
5,Reviewers seem to forget,". . . that Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.'s ""Slaughterhouse Five"" was written by a pillar of salt. That's not merely a sacrifice of blood but a sacrifice of blood, flesh, bone, and eyelash. Read it that way and be excruciatingly grateful."
2,Great prose but little direction,"I love Kurt Vonnegut but like ""Jailbird"", ""Slaughterhouse 5"" is full of details and great phrases, but little pay-off.From the beginning we become acquainted with Billy Pilgrim, an impish lucky man who fakes it through life. Pilgrim is a pathetic but intriquing character. We meet others along the way. The British POWs that warn of ""Jerry"" are hilarious and great sketches of the English.Vonnegut's description of the bleak landscape of war and of normal life is great. But the narrative goes in circles the entire book. There was no progression or path to it. I understood why Pilgrim had the trauma and the absurdity of the events. Still there's no movement and every chapter seems the same. Again, if you've read ""Jailbird"" you'll recognize this flaw of his works.I would instead recommend ""Cat's Cradle"", ""Breakfest Of Champions"" or ""Mother Night""."
2,Simple and Simplistic,"This is an easy-to-read satire that alludes to the weighty concepts of war, death and fate but never seems to bring home the point. The novel seems to revel in the fact that it even though it is simple it is really about the Big Ideas (""Look at me! Look at me!""). Just mentioning those ideas over and over again without examining them is not enough."
5,What more can you say?,"Not much. On a re-reading, what is most impressive is how horror is communicated so well in writing that is so understated . This is true of other great works on war, whether the Gettysburg Address or Washington's Farewell Address or An Irish Airman Forsees His Death. Understated and compressed---you don't need a lot to get to the core. If you have not read this book since high school or college, pull it out and read it again. I promise:it is worth it."
5,Great piece of work,"I read Slaughterhouse-Five for one of my English classes and fell in love with Vonnegut's writing. It was such a strange book but it was so entertaining.Similar to the concept of The Matrix, Vonnegut makes you wonder what's real and what's dream as the main character drifts back and forth between his own time in World War II and other sub-realities of different times, both before and after he lived. Vonnegut's writing is so solid, however, that you don't feel pushed too hard or fast. This is especially important given the strange story.Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the best books I've ever read and I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid to stretch their minds."
3,it's no catch-22,"I thought this book was maybe a tad over-rated, perhaps because I just read catch-22 and this was supposed to be in the same vein. It's a bit disjointed (by design) but once you get used to that, it's not too difficult to get used to the shifts in time and place. There are some funny lines here and there, and a few insights into the lunacy of war, particulary the bombing of dresden, but overall i would not say the book profoundly moved me. I don't doubt Vonnegut's talent and you can see flashes of genius, but i still was left underwhelmed by the totality of the book. I kept waiting for more. If you want great dark humor centered around ww2, with cutting insights regarding society - then i'd go back to catch-22. I'm willing to try another Vonnegut book - but this one leaves me a bit let down."
4,Interesting read,"I liked it, but not as much as Cat's Cradle. Still, if you have not read this, it's worth your time."
5,One of my favorites,This is one of the best books I've ever read. If you don't want to buy it I recommend renting it from the library. You're really missing out if you don't pick this up.
2,Vonnegut loses his own message,"Did anyone else read the copy of this book which had the introduction about Vonnegut meeting with a friend of his from Dresden and that man's wife? He promised the woman that he would not represent the events of Dresden in a John Wayne-style, but instead would represent the horror as it truly was. What Vonnegut has done with this book is even worse than if he had filled it with bravado and glory. His now token use of science fiction makes ridiculous the gruesome truth of war, and places this novel on the level of G.Gordon Liddy's writings in the realm of anti-war. Anybody read JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN?"
3,Entertaining and thought provoking,"This is the first Vonnegut book that I have read, and so, I can not be categorized as a fan. The book is good for, among others, the following reasons: 1)Its non-linear timeline stays fresh. 2) A rhythm is created by repeated motifs. 3)It is at once visceral and sensitive. 4)It is not too long. 5)It invites you to reconsider some common preconceptions. 6)Published in '68, it reflects its times.I did not rate it a 4, but I would actually place it closer to that than a 3. Easy to recommend."
5,My Deserted Island Book,"If I were ever stranded on a deserted island I'd like to have a copy of ""Slaughterhouse Five"" with me. I've read it nearly every year for the last twenty years or so, and find something new each time. Having a copy while stranded may help me get ""unstuck in time"" like Billy Pilgrim. It may offer an escape from the island for awhile. Everyone should have a copy of this book -- I have seven."
4,Grimly amusing,"I always enjoy rereading this book. Once you get used to the rather confusing structure, it provides horror and amusement in roughly equal measure. The writing style is excellent. I recently visited the beautiful city of Dresden for the first time, and had this book in mind for much of my visit. It was a sobering experience."
5,Fantastic!!!,"Great book, the sense of being unstuck in time is just incredible. It has a profound message on what death is really like. Its a MUST read."
3,A High School Student's Point of View,I think the book was okay but the introduction of tralfalmadors just creeped me out a little. His discription of certain scenarios in the war were fine but he went off the deepend when he wrote about his friends that no one knows about. Although I am just a high school student and plus I didn't read the whole thing so go figure.
5,A truly great book,"Come on, how could you not like this book? You've got a big fat woman, aliens, singing and dancing British P.O.W.s (one of the funniest moments I've ever read), and most importantly, a storyteller that dismisses everything with...So it goes. A great book, if you want sarcastic and bitter and funny stuff. I loved it."
5,"Poetry, Pure Beauty","Slaughter House Five is more than an American classic. It is truth and poetry and so much more. I am not an over zealous fan when I say that this book is truly the best ever written. It is. ""God bless you"", Mr. Vonnegut."
4,Didn't recieve the book with that cover.,"The book itself was in perfect, brand-new condition, but it was a different cover which was disappointing. The only reason I had purchased this book was because of the cover."
1,I don't get it,"How this book became a classic is beyond me. Insipid and dull with a disjointed story line. The final straw was the 100th repitition of the very annoying ""so it goes"" phrase the author is compelled to use after every death. Stopped reading the book about halfway into it just to avoid another iteration. I guess one had to have grown up in the LSD era to appreciate this rambling and bizaar book."
1,Not worth reading ever,"Mind poisoning and looks at life as a free period to do anything and everything in instead of life meaning something. Horrible book, and I regret reading"
1,So It Goes,"Though this book has so many reviews, I decided to share my opinion. It appears that a fair number of people love this book, as it was at my school when we read it. However, I'd like to tell anyone who thought it was overly strange and disjointed, I agree! So it goes... some enjoy classics like this, some do not. My english teacher told me I took it too seriously. All I have to say to him is, ""Po-tee-weet!"""
1,"tedious, pretentious novel","To judge by your reviews, I'm certainly in the minority. I read this book for a reading group and the best thing I can say is that it was mercifully short. I found the style disjointed and artifical. True, it gave one a desolate feeling about war and its follies, but cerainly other books have done it better, certainly in a more attainable less tedious style."
4,another vonnegut masterpiece,"Vonnegut once again introduces an audience to a zany world full of colorful characters and situations. In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut gives a detailed description of Billy Pilgrim and the events he encounters throughout his life, as well the philosophical influence that he gains from writer Kilgore Trout (a character that Vonnegut uses in other books, Breakfast of Champions). Overall, I thought this was an excellent book. I love the way that Vonnegut writes; beginning with a story, then preceeding with a different one, and connect the two later on in the novel. I highly recommend this book."
2,"not writing, slop, perhaps useful as toilet paper","Kurt Vonnegut is not a writer. He is someone who was able, through his contacts with governmental money provided to academics in the 30s, to foist is sloppy, humourous(lacking actual literary ability) cheaply and dishonorably written work upon us. As a student I was forced to read this monster. His books are not writing, they are pure tom foolary. This book, lauded to be the capstone, the beggining for an exploration of his touted literary genious, is actually probably only useful as toilet paper.So it goes... Kurt Vonnegut uses this disgustingly cheap segway to work himself out of every situation. His book wastes pages and pages of precious ink talking about aliens and splicing in images of WWII.Its pure trash. Up their with Michal Moores ""stupid White men""."
1,I Don't Get It,"O.K., I read it, but I literally have no idea what this book is about. And I'm not reading it again to find out either. Apparently, people like almost anything in life, which is really a sad commentary on the human condition."
1,ick.,"I don't like how Vonnegut down-plays death. What's the phrase? ""and so it goes""? I also don't like how the author puts down morals and values. I don't care if Pilgrim has been through war, that doesn't give him an excuse to loose all human pride."
4,what is all the fuss?,"I don't understand why people have fallen all over themselves to praise this book. As one reader suggested, it's not the sort of book you can enjoy sheerly for entertainment. I found Vonnegut's prose style very difficult to penetrate , and the constantly shifting point of view was jarring, although the sardonic tone of the novel was often humourous. Unfortunately, I've been more gripped by stories of war (various war movies/documentaries), laughed louder at an author's tongue-in-cheek view of society (Tom Robbines, Julian Barnes), and read novels where shifing points of view help to illustrate and illuminate the story (Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient, Joseph Heller's Catch-22). But I can't deny that beyond these criticisms and what I can't deny to be some frustrations when reading this book, it was above all, a good read. . I just don't think it's deserving of the ""classic"" status that seems to be attributed to it by many readers."
4,I understand why it is a classic,"While I wasn't overly fond of the story (it was disjointed, had no plot, character development, or timeline) I really liked this book because of the political and philosophical statment made. I highly recommend this book."
5,A MODERN MASTERPIECE,"The first of many Vonnegut books that I have read, this book opened my eyes to my own pessimism in mankind. To some this would be a bad thing but I really enjoyed explamining my own life through his words. I have even added a saying to my vocabulary to help me get through life: SO IT GOES"
2,"Okay, I guess......","This book was very difficult to understand. I didn't like the book itself, and especially the way Vonnegut belittles values. The only thing I really loved was the way he kept using the phrase ""so it goes"" It gave the book a feeling of reality...like saying ""This is the truth. Deal with it."" I think I'll try rereading the book when I'm a little older to see if I like it more then."
2,"Neither an anti-war book, nor a funny book","This book is very easy to read, but not very gripping. I heard its supposed to be an antiwar book and funny it was neither. Its about a weak man with no volition. So, I guess if you are a weak man with no volition, then maybe you would like this book.I cannot fathom why this book is on any curriculum, or is evenly mildly interesting to anyone."
5,slaughter house five,"I hate Dresden yes I do I hate Dresden how about you?Here the sound of the falling rain comeing down like an armageodon flame, a shame the ones who died without a name. Hear the dogs howling out of key to a hymn called faith in misery, and bleed the company lost the war today. I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives on holiday. Hear the drum pounding out of time another protester has crossed the line to find the moneys on the other side. Can I get another amen theres a flag wraped around the score of men a gag a plastic bag on a monument. Prezzzch the representative of Dresden Germany now has the floor. Seek out to the president gas-man bombs away is your punishment. Pulverize the Eiffel towers who critisize your government. Bang bang goes the broken glass and kill all the jews that dont agree. Trials by fire setting fire thats not a way thats ment for me."
5,"The first Vonnegut book I read, and it was great!","I greatly enjoyed this book, especially the time travel between past, present, and future. This book was a little hard to follow, but had a great story line and characters. I liked how the author expressed his opinions through the thoughts and words of Billy Pilgrim. I found this book so interesting that I've already started a new Vonnegut book, and expect it to be just as good."
4,Vonnegut is unreal..,"I am a huge fan of his writing, but sadly, it was not due to his more famous novel, Slaughterhouse Five. Whilst I did enjoy this book, I found the ending a little offputting, and it is certainly one I have forgotten, although reading it not that long ago. I felt it was similar in style, and maybe a little in substance (despite the lack of aliens) to Catch 22, although Catch 22 remains one of my favourites. Perhaps the difference between the two is that Catch 22 had time to be developed, where as Slaughterhouse Five was a tad short. I felt the method of storytelling was immensly effective, as well as highly capturing attention wise. I would love to give this novel five stars simply because Vonnegut is such a champ, but I felt there was something missing. Nevertheless, most certainly worth the short read it is."
4,All around good story lacking dual moments.,"Never a boring part and fully entertaining. He jumps around so much which makes it very unpredictable and there are many different people that the main character billy comes into contact with, most of which end up dead somehow or the other. After every death he follows with the coment ""So it goes."" I think stressing the fact that that's part of life. Quirky humor and always on the move through time and space. Also extreamly imaginative."
3,"Nihilist, Anti-Christian, and Dubious Facts","Personally, I do not care for Kurt Vonnegut's politics and lack of faith. The underlying story of Dresden is quite interesting. However, it has been in vapid dispute the number of dead that Vonnegut claims as irrefutable fact. Vonnegut paints his star ""protagonist"" as an uncaring nihilist. Furthermore, sporadically dispersed throughout the novel are anti-Christian rants and allusions. I believe everyone can agree war is horrible. However, the author could have wrote about it without the liberal, anti-Christian, nihilist prose. Slaughterhouse five is basically the personal view's of Vonnegut with a mildly amusing story about Dresden during World War II."
2,cynical and misanthropic,"This was the most anti-human book that I've read since Gulliver's Travels. Vonnegut's cynicism and apathy are understandable considering the atrocities that he witnessed during the war, and I imagine writing the book was a cathartic experience for him, but other than that, there's not much to be gained from this novel.Vonnegut's shell-shocked brain appears incapable of distinguishing between the Germans who were injecting dye into women's and children's eyes and rendering them into soap and candles and the Allied soldiers that sacrificed their lives trying to stop them.His main points seem to be:1. War is stupid.2. People are stupid.3. Life is meaningless.4. There's nothing any of us can do about it.5. So, try not to think about the bad things in your life and just think happy thoughts.If this is your life's philosophy, you will also consider this a ""brilliant"" work."
1,"Overpriced, Poorly Made Edition - Stay Away","This is a review of this particular edition from Perfection Learning. It is terribly made, and overpriced. they are basically putting out a permabound edition of the paperbacks here, so in reality you are buying an overpriced paperback. The copyright pages even note the book was a paperback edition. STEER CLEAR OF THIS EDITION of Slaughterhouse 5 and any edition of any book by this manufacturer. Not worth the extra price at all."
4,A great anti war book,"a very original and thought provoking book about the human condition in general and humans in war time in particular. I found it lacking in emotion, but it's an amazing read."
4,Strangely compelling; vaguely misogynistic,"This is the first Vonnegut novel I've read so I didn't know what to expect. Strange book but I'll say this--I read it in one sitting because it's so odd, it kept me curious to see what the author would do next. My main reading diet is thrillers and nonfiction--not much literary fiction. Slaughterhouse Five is an odd combo of literary fiction and sci-fi.Overall: fascinating; intriguing; keeps you thinking for a while after reading. On the other hand, this book has a consciously inflated sense of self-importance and a vague atmosphere of misogyny. It's billed as a compelling anti-war novel. Well, it is anti-war, I suppose, but the protagonist is so pathetic that his failure as a soldier seems to reflect his failure in life as a whole. If you want an anti-war novel, tryAll Quiet on the Western Front."
4,Why have I not read this before?,"This is a book I can unreservedly recommend. Read it now! It is thoughtful, human, and explains so much of our recent history and mores and relationships. Enjoyed the use of 'the repeat' - made a big impact on me. Splendid writing."
4,Well Worth Giving a Try,"Slaughterhouse 5 is supposedly an antiwar book. Instead it is a creative tale juxtaposing the war experiences of the main character, Billy Pilgrim, with other events in his life, most notably his kidnapping by space aliens. Pilgrim is weak character who drifts though life, moving back and forth in time and space, sometimes on Earth, sometimes on an alien planet. Time didn't flow in one direction for Billy Pilgrim. As the book progresses, Pilgrim sometimes lives in his future, at others goes back to his past.I thought Slaughterhouse 5 was an engrossing read and enjoyed it quite a bit. This is not the kind of book I would normally pick up, and I'm glad I didn't read it in high school, because I would have hated it then. It's a bit more profane and graphic than I prefer, but that didn't take away from the story. This is a good science fiction story and worth giving a try."
5,classic,This book gets better with every read. It is worth owning if ever a book was. Enjoy. I like the paper version best.
5,"Absurd, yet Powerful","Slaughterhouse-Five is, as its jacket cover boasts, ""one of the world's great antiwar books."" Centered around the infamous firebombing of Dresden in late World War II, the novel takes its readers on a ridiculous journey through the life of Billy Pilgrim, a detached sort of fellow who has become unstuck in time. As sad as it is hilarious, Slaughterhouse-Five is a thought-provoking novel whose morals are disguised by absurdity. Be prepared for Vonnegut's refreshingly strange writing style; the book is much more enjoyable if you let Vonnegut carry you away to his unique and darkly humorous world. It takes some effort to decipher the novel's abstruse themes, but there is much to be learned from Billy's search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world."
3,"Fun, Subtle War Bashing","I found it to be an interesting story of a man mentally escaping to a fantasy world in order to deal with the unshakable hypocrisy, severity, and useless tragedy of war that he had to participate in at such a young age. While I never served in Iraq or Afghanistan, being a military member at a young age, I could identify with being so young and naive, having to make some very mature and profound choices. I did not find Vonnegut very funny, however; if you are trying to make a profound anti-war statement, soldiers taking a crap in a latrine as comic relief seems a little sophmoric and out of place. I did find the irony of Billy Pilgrim's appearance in the prisoner camp funny, however. It is very suiting. Overall, I found it a cool, modern look at the impact of the ethics (or lacktherof) of warfare, and the morality and mental fragility of its soldiers then and now."
1,AWFUL! Just AWFUL!,"This was the WORST book I have ever read in my life! I would'nt even give it 1 stars, I would give it -11! If you are thinking about reading this book I suggest you not. This book was very confusing, and it had no plot. I think that there are to many good books in this world to be wasting your time reading this horrible book!"
1,"It's not a Daniele Steele book, so I don't like it","While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax.I prefer Daniele Steele, and there's no basis for telling me I'm wrong. Vonnegut is no better or worse than Daniele Steele!"
3,"The novel was okay, but I found it hard to follow","I thought the anti-war theme was very good. It reminds you of how bad war really is. I'm only 17 so I havn't ever experinced a real war. I think that movies and shows today do to much to glorify war, but this book does a great job of making you realize what war is like. One think I did not like was all the time traveling and the whole alien thing. I found it to be confusing and stupid. Other than that I liked the book."
4,This book had a unique concept that kept my interest.,"This book is one of the greatest time-travel and antiwar stories. It follows Billy Graham through his fragmented journey, which takes place through the bombing of Dresden in World War II. It shows Billy in all phases of his life, concentrating on his shattering experiences as a prisoner of war."
5,A Wonderful Absurdity,"This book is as fascinating as it is strange. It takes an important and normal concept like W.W.II, and through narration, repetition, and dark humor, turns it into a strong political statement before you realize what it is really saying.Vonnegut writes this so that it is easy to read and it moves quickly. When he talks about violence or death, he points it out so blatantly and casually that it is disguised, and the reader quickly passes over it.It is very serious and well thought out, despite its casual narration and humor. Kurt Vonnegut uses strange ideas like aliens to help paint a clear picture of the main character Billy Pilgrim's life, and provide a way to break up the war story and the horror of the Dresden bombing with other information.The alien concept of time is also very interesting and provides something to think about for quite some time after reading the novel."
4,Classic reading,"I was forced to read this book in high school and remember thinking for a book I was forced to read, I enjoyed it. Although at the time I found it difficult to follow. I don't think this is a book one reads for simple enjoyment. It's pretty deep, if I remember correctly. Some of Vonnegut's other stuff is more enjoyable, 'Galapagos' for example."
5,A definate great read and classic,"This classic story follows Billy Pilgrim through Dresden, his marriage, his life on an alien planet, and death. Yet it mostly follows him to Dresden in World War II where he was a child at war (he was technically an adult, yet a young one). His ability to time travel was given to him by the aliens where he frequently returns to the life and events at Dresden Germany. A town that was later firebombed killing many Germans who were not soldiers, or an industrious city.A book that tries to get you to focus on the beauty of life, while trying to teach about the atrocities that sometimes happens and no one knows about."
3,Not for me - whacked,"A different story of the life of Billy Pilgrim. After you get in to it, the book is sort of riveting, although confusing. The book is about Billy Pilgrim, POW, who goes goes back and forth through life, marrigae, job, etc., in atypical order that takes place over and over - in a Twilight Zone style. Pilgrim lives in traumatic devastating times and seems to never connect. A repeated line in this novel, ""And so it goes,"" is a bit over-done and appears to say ""whatever"" accept it and move on. Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five - accept it and move on."
2,Not what the picture is,"I got this for a friend because they collect old books, only to find out that the image they provide is not what they sell. They sell the 25th anniversary edition of it, a green book that is fine if you want to read the book but a disappointment for someone who wanted what they were shown."
2,Don't let this one turn you off from Vonnegut,"I don't put books down very often, but I put this one down. There are more readable Vonnegut novels out there for the casual reader (like Bluebeard)"
3,"Slaughter-House Five, a book inspired by insanity","This difinatly is the most messed up book that I have read to date. Although I must confess that even with all that happens, it is still a book that is enjoyable. However not very appropriate for the young, do to some of crude and sometimes violent events. It is also a book that can seem dificult to follow with Billy going back and forth in time, this causes it to sometimes become a frustrating read."
3,A taste for ideas...,This book is defenitly one of the 20th century's finer works of liteture but one would have to have a taste for unusal writing and ideas. A balanced mix of science fiction and historical events and unheroic characters to create a novel that has lasted it's time and times to come. The ideas that are presnted throughout this novel are not easy and but beautiful if one can be opened minded to them.I suggest to try to read this and finish even though the writing style is unnatural.
5,The best book of the 20th century?,"Buy this book, better still, buy the 25th anniversary edition. I re-read it ever few years, and still get impressed by it's relevance. Everyone should own a copy of this book.Anti-war books don't get any better, but, to quote from the introduction, ""What sort of book is it?"", ""It's an anti-war book"", ""You may as well write an anti-glacier book""."
5,Finally something unique!,"Ever since the first time I heared ""Plato's Cave"" I have been in love with this music. There is nothing else on the music scene quite like DFW. From start to finish Enchanted Parkway is a great CD- it is the perfect follow up to the first. DFW also puts on a great live show. If you have the chance to see them, don't pass it up!!"
5,Great follow-up from one of Seattle's Best,"Enchanted Parkway is the second album from this amazing Seattle band. Though hard to capture what they do so well in the live sense, this 6 track CD does pretty well. ""Golden"" stands out heads above the other tracks, but ""Plato's cave"" ranks pretty high up there too. I didn't care much for their cover of the B52's ""Planet Claire"" but others might. If you ever get the chance to see DFW live, do not miss them!"
3,Robby and John carry on,"This CD contains a very listenable collection of songs, originally on two separate albums made by the Butts Band, paced by ex-Doors Robby Krieger and John Densmore. Robby's post-Doors work is often marked by eclecticism, and the hard and soft rock here is accompanied by or infused with blues, some soul, and a bit of reggae. Still, while almost all the tracks are decent, there is little that is outstanding. Jess Roden's vocals and rhythm guitar highlight the earlier tracks (1-8), reflecting the first album's British lineup save the two ex-Doors. The second group of songs was made by an entirely American outfit. Although the Butts Band's eponymous first album was generally seen as superior, the second album, ""Here and Now,"" had a number of pretty tracks, on display here. Despite the relatively short time after Morrison's death (the Butts Band recorded in the mid-70s), and as you can obviously tell by now, these recordings do not sound anything like the Doors."
4,good to listen to,"this is fun to listen to, it reminds me of the eagles, it has that sort of sound, interesting to see what the doors drummer and guitarist did later on."
3,1 free when you buy three,"For free it was worth it, but to pay for it, I wouldnt recommend it. I was looking forward to listening mainly solo guitar pieces from the above mentioned composers but instead it's packed with concerto with the guitar as a background. I only got it because it included Larghetto and Estudio 2"
5,Best of Val Lewton,"Why Val Lewton even bothered with the sequel, I don't know. The first ""Cat People"" movie is spectacular and one of the ten best horror movies of the 1940s. More of a psychological thriller, you see very little because of the heavy use of shadows. Gregory William Mank's commentary is also inciteful and I wish most commentaries were like this (but Mank forgot to mention the two gargoyle statues in ""The Curse of the Cat People"" switch from left to right depending on which cut you see. I recommend you buy this today."
3,Mellowish,"Nothing to do with any Cat people of any sort. It is a nicely made film about the love of a father for his previous wife and for his daughter. This girl is more or less mesmerized by the ghost of the previous wife, who will protect her against some real danger. It is a moral lesson about loving children and accepting their ranting and raving as some kind of message about their lack of love or their desire for love. But be careful with kids. Curiosity kills the cat, or at least may kill the cat, even if here the cat, or the kitten, is nicely saved from its unavoidable end of freezing to death or choking in the hands of some bitter woman.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"
5,Perhaps the best movie about childhood ever,"Atmospheric, heartbreaking, and totally mesmerizing tale about a lonely, misunderstood child. So amazing to hear how it was sneaked into existence using ""Curse of Cat People"" title studio execs would think they were funding a horror film! In roundabout ways the plot and its message does relate to the original 1942 ""Cat People"": the first film is about a woman who is a social outcast. In sequel this character returns to befriend a little girl who is herself an outcast. This film does seem to have escaped wide attention due to the misleading title. The little girl's performance is unbelievably convincing and will move you to tears. Somehow this oddball movie gets to the heart of the universal heartbreak of childhood. Not to be missed!"
5,the hypnotic ambience of childhood,"Were you an imaginative child? Never quite fitting in? Did you ever fantasize about an eternal, all-powerful friend? Did you ever gaze into the windows of an old victorian house in your neighborhood, and fantasize, and live lives untold? Take the trip, settle into your chair,oh, please, settle in with some wine and fine cheese and biscuits, and travel back. If this one doesn't get to you, as they say, you have a hole in your soul...."
4,Another turning point for Horror Films in General.,"Cat People was really ground breaking when it first came out in the early 1940's. Cat people has invented one the best scare tactics which is, ""What you don't see is ten times scarier than something that you do see"". The studio that made this movie might didn't know if they did invent this type of scare, but if look at some of today's horror movies everyone is using it."
4,Hours of fun for little boys.,"Very nice, high quality item. My boys, ages 6 and 8, really enjoy playing with it, loading it up and unloading it. Lots of removable and movable parts. Lots of creative, imaginative playtime. Highly recommended for little boys!"
4,Happiness,"This truck made our 5 year old grandson very happy. He loves to ""farm"" and we couldn't find a truck that was roomy enough for him to haul things. What good is a truck that is too small to haul things? He was one excited boy when he opened this. Grandpa and Grandma are a little concerned about durability--it's all plastic. We will see."
3,This was as comfortable...,"...as a pair of comfortable fashion sandle can get, I think. But coming from Dr. Scholl's I had expected even more comfort. It did not hurt walking with it, but I know it will hurt if I walked more than a couple of hundred feet in it. Maybe not terribly, and it IS very cute, but I'd not make this a pair of work shoe or mall-shopping shoe."
3,too big for me,"I use the timer everyday and this watch does not stop working (I have it for more than a year)When I first saw it, I did not like the color and the size."
5,Still ahead of its time,"As a fan of Josh's minimal house anthems, I purchsed Hearhear when it first came out in 98. At first I was amazed the variety of geners on display: breakbeat, atmospheric drum and base, ambient and of course, classic Josh Wink house. This album is hard edged like steele and challeges the listner. This is not an easy album, its not a trance trip or an IDM head game. Its just one of the best, doing what he does best. On another note, don't use this to judge all that Josh is capable of. To see him live is to drfit through deep goovy house, slip through some jungle and get pounced by minimalist house. He is one of the best DJ's, period. And one of the nicest guys in the industry. To this day (four years after its release) This album is still a year or two ahead of its time."
1,enormous disappointment,"this album reeked of josh trying to live up to his reputation...it's a tidy little collection of ditty-bop techno tunes without heart - except maybe ""sixth sense."" the appearance of trent reznor is gratuitous at best, and frankly, it sounds to me like josh got shoved out of the studio when trent was ushered in. i had high hopes for this album, especially considering the quality of everything else ovum's put out so far, and all the times i've seen josh's sets live. better luck with the sophomore effort."
2,Go with the beat or else...,"This is not a particularly well-crafted work. There is precious little variety in rhythms and almost no melody to speak of. If that crazy beating rave scene is your cup of tea, you might do OK. Those looking for a challenging collection of electronic music could do much better. Beeps and bass sounds are often so similar that it can seem not only like the tracks were made on the same keyboard but also on the same settings. Reznor adds trademark dissonance but helps only marginally. ""Sixth Sense"" is the worst ""techno"" song I have ever heard."
1,pitch black background and clothes,"I was very disappointed with this instructional video. The background is pitch black and the male dancer wears black pants and shoes, so you can barely see what he is doing from the waist down, which is very important to see in order to learn. (Whole point of the video, no?) Each step is only done once or twice, so you'd have to rewind over and over until you get it. Don't buy it! It's a waste of money. It is two disembodied heads floating around the screen."
3,I'm Content With It,"I'm happy with it. Well worth the discounted price. I've purchased or reviewed close to 100 dance DVDs. Initially, over a year ago, when I started dancing and buying dance DVDs; I was extremely unhappy with Teresa Masons DVDs. They were too difficult for me to follow.. Now, after learning the very basics of dance, I think I've purchased all of hers for under $12.00 each. Reason: I think ""Most bang for the Buck"" if you buy them at the discounted price through Amazon. The DVD looks as if it's been copied from a video tape. However, I'd still rate the video quality a 7 out 0 10. Excellent menu and sub-menu operations! Very quickly, you can go right to any spot on the DVD. Need to though because of minimum demonstration of the dance move."
2,ID was not same as advertised,The od and wall thickness were correct but the ID was much larger than advertised. It will cost just as much to send the item back so it is not worth the effort to ship it.
3,'Mercury Is Not On The Money',"Bruce playing a demoted FBI cop who desperately wants to protect an innocent autistic child after he cracks a secret government code is pretty standard for Bruce. I mean isn't that what he always does in his movies? This was not very original, except for the fact that Bruce did show a much softer side to movie-goers that we rarely get to see. Alec Baldwin was really good as sounding like a villan, but he just basically reads his lines and that's about it. BEWARE OF THIS MOVIE FOR IT LACKS A SERIOUS STORYLINE. But if you are a Bruce Willis fan, that probably won't matter. Besides Bruce has done worse work than this. The script is pretty bad, so in defence of Bruce's acting, he can only work with what is given to him...."
3,Not like Willis. But has some wonderful drama,"This was a good rent movie, but not like other films of Willis. It has a touching drama with the kid, but on the other hand, it has some bad minor actors that don't know how to act."
3,Not the Bruce Willis we know in Die Hard,"It's kind of hard to picture Bruce Willis as the sentimental type. However, in this movie, he takes on the responsibility of an autistic boy and breaks all the rules to get to the bottom. Along the way you see Bruce Willis with a heart for this child. Not a bad movie, not the best either."
2,Average to disappointing.....,I saw this film as a rental and thought it was average at best. The plot was transparent - and has anyone else had enough of Bruce Willis as the renegade cop? Baldwin was not compelling as the villian and there was a weak supporting cast. I thought they took a potentially interesting story and did very little with it. Rent it when everything else is out....
3,"Fell short of it's potential, but entertaining.","Willis's character is interesting as a FBI agent haunted by past mistakes, and Baldwin makes a credible bad guy, but the usual Hollywood lust for blood stretch the viewers ability to suspend disbelief. The plot was compelling, if you like the ""Conspiracy Theory"" genre but, without giving away the plot, there were some events that did not seem reasonable given the circumstances. If the producers could have focused on the characters and plot a little more, and avoided shooting people at every opportunity, this could have been a great movie."
4,A different bit of suspense,"I usually enjoy any Bruce Willis film, as he is indeed a very talented actor. I thought this was going to be just another action film, but the story line was a new twist and the movie holds your interest well. Alec Baldwin is a sincerely menacing meanie - cold hearted to the core. Only Alan Rickman could have played it crueler. A good addition to my collection, and I am sure I will repeat viewing from time to time."
3,pretty darn good,when bruce wills appears in movies with adults he tends to make me annoyed. but when he appears with kids.He seemes very good. this move is great it way be a dumb action movie but it has some heart.Miko hughes gives the best perfomance. he really seemes autstic. most movies such as house of cards and jounery of the heart deal with autisum but you can tell. they dint reasach it. thismovie does however. thats the main resoni like it. It also has suspsence.it is willis second best movie....
4,the boy knows all,one of Willis' softer more gentler side as he trys to save a young boys life from the evil clutches of the menacing Alec Baldwin. some lagin parts but its picked up by Willis' care for the kid and the ending where Baldwin flys and soars to the bottom off the building. suspense and plot take good aim here
3,Mercury Rising,"This film is distinguished by some good performances by the actors and by competent direction. The script, though, is very formulaic and burdened with implausibility. That governments can disregard the rights of their citizens is not news. That being admitted, the contrived plot makes this one only passable."
1,SO VERY VERY BAD,"Let me just say first that I forgive Bruce Willis very easily when he makes a bad movie. And this IS a bad movie. Make that VERY bad. There is no suspense, originality. Even the kid is annoying. If it had been a little girl maybe it could have been better. Even John Barry's musical score is bad. If you want to see a GOOD Bruce Willis movie buy LAST MAN STANDING."
1,Deceptive Advertising,Buying this was an education. HD-DVDs will not play on a standard DVD player nor on a Blu=Ray player. But there was nothing in the advertising for this item to indicate that. I returned the product.
2,Same old stuff,"1. There's not much point of writing a review on such an old movie and a predictable / semi-lame action film, other than to perhaps warn others not to waste their time or money.2. If completely bored and you happen to have a friend who has a copy of this movie, ok--> go ahead an watch it. However, otherwise, you'd be better off watching something like one of the Bruce Willis Die Hard films."
3,Very Predictable.,"Thought it was going to be more like Sixth Sense, but just another action flick.Bruce does everything just perfectly. never gets hurt, etc."
3,Joel Storchan,"Mercury Rising was the first movie, that I can recall in which Bruce Willis is actually playing a serious character who is not just shooting bad guys. I was delighted by the concept and the folding story of this autistic savant youth placed into a action packed adventure. Bruce is showing that he can deeply care for his fellow man. Which, in itself, is unusual for this actor in the past. I enjoyed the development of the characters and the believable heartlessness of the government bureaucrat. I was intrigued by the trusting nature of the programmers, yet they were typical geeks who do their job but don't understand the political side of what they do. I like the photography, the story, the actions, the bad guys, the good guys and the drama. I give this a three star rating, it was a good time watching the movie. Oh, don't forget the popcorn."
3,Exciting Bruce Willis Action Vehicle!,"This one follows the Action Formula, but in it's own strange way it kind of works. Bruce Willis is his own heroic self and delivers a good performance. Alec Baldwin delivers an over-the-top performance, but never really becomes a lethal villain. Some nice action sequences and while the plot is weak, some elements are intriguing. Miko Hughes is also good as the autistic boy who cracks a secret government code. Delivers the action and entertains. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 6!"
2,"So - So, at Best","This movie contains two headline stars (Bruce Willis and Alec Baldwin) involved in a conspiracy plot that's a bit too much even for 2011 conspiricists. Supposedly a high-level NSA leader (Baldwin) gives orders to eliminate an autistic child who has decoded their new super-secret code. If you believe either part of that prior sentence, I've got some ocean-front land in Arizona I'd like to sell you.The end of the movie features several minutes of glass panel-breaking and shooting - thereby fulfilling its violence and action quota."
4,Entertaining - Yes!,"Three (3) Bruce Willis films for the price of one; how can you loose? I have always found Bruce's films to be entertaining, plus I have never seen '12 Monkeys' before; it was strange but entertaining. These films go great with a bowl of popcorn."
3,For True Fans Only,A true fan of Bruce Willis Action movies will enjoy this film. If you are from Chicago you will have fun picking out the places where the scenes are shot. If you have not seen it and are looking for something new for an afternoon try it out.
5,Wow!,Bruce Willis helps save an autistic child from government bad guys to think the boy knows their secrets. Another excellent performance for Willis.
4,Don't usually like Bruce,"I don't usually like Bruce Willis films but this one I enjoyed. My husband says it was intriguing, a good mystery"
4,Bruce Willis,"There is not an actor in Hollywood that plays opposite children better than Bruce Willis.Although a standard action film for Bruce, he nonetheless takes command of a weak script and turns in another superb performance. He does not allow the film to become a cartoon (like other action actors do) -- he keeps it real. This film is worth watching just to see Bruce kick ass on the bad guys."
2,Dumb premise.,"If the super code was placed in a puzzle magazine (How would you even do this?), to test the ""geek factor"" and the code were broken, wouldn't you discard the code as failed because someone broke it? NO, let's kill the person, and anyone else that subsequently breaks the code. I try not to get too analytical in watching movies but this was too much of a stretch."
3,Not sure I'd trust it to catch the game.,"In all honesty, the watch is probably more of a 3.5 than a 3. It's not a 4 (at least on my scale)simply because it doesn't keep very good time. It kind of reminds me of the old digital watches you could get from mailing in cereal box tops.The logo and band are very nice and you can show your team pride, maybe just fall back on using something else to give you an accurate time."
4,Lots of interesting ideas,"This book contains perhaps a bit too much general background. After all, there are already many shelfloads of books out there that cover things like design and project management.Otherwise, there are lots of things that sound quite interesting. Plenty of references to real products (both commercial and freeware). Clearly the author has extensively researched the field (being one of the authors of DDD probably helped).Delta debugging, parallel debugging and omniscient debugging all look very interesting. There seem to be more tools available for Java than for other languages. This is probably a reflection of the ease of debugging the JVM. As a C and C++ programmer, I was a bit envious of this situation."
4,worth looking for,"I've always liked Megadeth, so I was very interested in hearing essentially what a Dave Mustaine project would sound with someone else singing, and it turned out much better than I could have expected! Lee Ving's singing, although very limited, fits the music very well, much better than the remastered version of this CD where Dave rerecorded the vocal tracks. It definately contributes to the laid-back feel to the CD, something a Megadeth album could never claim to be; you can practically hear the cracking of the whip Dave Mustaine uses to keep the guys strictly and rigidly in tempo on Megadeth albums, but he must have left that whip in his other guitar case for these sessions..."
3,Love the movie-the DVD quality should be better,It's a Carey Grant movie-love it. I am disappointed that it was not re-mastered. I have a Blu-ray player and Samsung LCD TV with 7.1 surround system. The system automatically resizes for best quality. Which for me means the picture is not widescreen. The sound is not digital quality either. Given the option of watching on a VCR or this DVD-I would still pick the DVD. A little disappointed in the quality.
5,Great Oldie but Great!,Bought 3 videos for my elderly mother and she loves them. Can't get the classics without being edited on television; she's very happy with her new movies :-)!
5,My favorite Cary Grant Movie,"You just can't go wrong with Cary Grant, and this is my all time favorite Cary Grant movie. No matter how many times I watch it, I still laugh watching him dealing with all those little girls and their fussy teacher (Leslie Caron) while they try to make the best of being stuck on an island during WWII. The movie has just the right combination of tension (the daring night rescue of the girls from a neighboring Japanese occupied island)and comedy (Cary Grant's response when one of the teenage girls developes a crush on him). The seriousness of the war is not forgotten, but it is tempered with humor, and of course, a developing love story. A definite must see for any Cary Grant fan."
5,father goose,This is a wonderful classic that everyone should see.This is one of Cary Grants best movies and its a wonderful romance and comedy wrapped together at its best.
3,"Not Widescreen 1.85:1 but Full Screen ""Matted"" 1.85:1","This is a great movie but the DVD is not Widescreen in the true sense. It is Full Screen Letterbox but called ""Matted"" 1.85:1. You will have black bars top, bottom and both sides.Vey disappointing."
1,Quality of the DVD is not good.,I have loved this movie since I was a child. I own it VHS & was looking forward to having it on DVD. I am very disappointed in the the quality of this DVD. It looks like it skipped a few seconds on one sceen & the sound is only so-so in a couple of others. Even the DVD case it came in is cheesy and arrived broken.
5,Great movie.,This is one of my favorite Cary grant movies of all time. It came in good quality and my wife who had never seen it before absolutely loves it.
5,Father Goose and Mister Roberts,Got both of these movies off of Amazon for my husband. We both love the older movies. The grandkids love them too. Our son has so many and they have movie night on the weekend.
5,Father Goose,"Received product in a timely fashion. Product was indicated as used but good and it was. Enjoyed watching a wholesome movie with no violence, foul language, etc."
4,"Vintage Humor, Brilliant Acting","Walter Eckland (Cary Grant) is an American in Australia during World War II. He gets tricked into doing shore watch on a small uninhabited island for the Royal Australian Navy. Commander Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard) is an old friend who had been harbor master before he was recruited into the Navy for the war. He and Walter engage in a battle of wits. But things get complicated when Houghton asks (OK, bribes) Walter to go to a nearby island and rescue the shore watch there. Instead, he finds the very proper Miss Catherine Freneau (Leslie Caron) and seven or eight little girls from the consulate school where she was the daughter of the consul. They had been dropped off on the island and were supposed to be picked up later, but the rescue didn't come.So most of the story is the irascible Walter trying to get rescued from the clutches of a gaggle of girls. It's a cute story, I won't deny that."
4,A great relaxing movie,"A sweet and simple gem of a movie, fun for all ages. It is nice to be able to share such movies with children and not worry about negative images. It is set in WW2 and involves a beachcomber and a teacher with 7 charges."
4,Touches all the right buttons.,"They don't make stars like Cary Grant anymore, his combination of maturity, good looks, and comedic timing defines triple threat.And subtle, I attribute much of Grant's strength on the screen to his downplay of situation. A movie like Father Goose usually sets up a comedic crisis, onto which more and more outlandish crises are stacked.Through it all, Mr. Grant keeps his powder dry.I personally prefer ""Operation Petticoat"" (directed by Blake Edwards) for `boys will be boys' comedy. But the romanticism of Father Goose (Leslie Caron is great) makes this film play far better to couples.You cannot go wrong with either."
4,"1.85 widescreen, FATHER GOOSE","I love this movie and bought the Republic DVD.It states on the box that it is in it's original aspect ratio of 1.85, but when you put the movie on, it is only 1.66 to 1.77, it definately is not 1.85.I don't know if anyone else noticed this or not.Thanks, Joanie"
5,FASTHER GOOSE,WE HAVE WATCHED THIS VIDEO SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND ALWAYS SEEM TO GET GOOD ENTERTAINMENT AS THE EVENTS UNFOLD!
5,Father Goose,"I love this movie. This is one I recommend for ""Family Night"". One of Cary Grant's best. Worth watching over and over again."
5,Movie DVD,I think this was a great movie. One of the classics and the movie was delivered on time and in great condition
4,Social Dropouts Viewers Love,"It's surprising that no one has mentioned the plot similarities between ""Father Goose"" and ""The African Queen."" Both depict cynical men who have become disillusioned and dropped out of society. Both are forced by circumstance to help ultra-civilized, uptight women escape from invading enemies. In each film the hero and the heroine have to make accommodations in order to survive. By the end of the film they're in love. The difference between the two movies is that ""The African Queen"" is a drama with comedic elements, and ""Father Goose"" is a comedy with dramatic elements. Cary Grant had the talent to play any kind of part, but he learned early in his career that his fans wanted him to play ""Cary Grant,"" and he didn't didn't disappoint them."
3,For the Serious Seeker,"It is best not to let any book be your bible, but this book is interesting. In the words of Gene Davis ""do not read to believe or disbelieve but read and let you own inner self knowledge know if it is right for you."" If you are really open minded this book will stir a lot of emotions that may provide some needed clearing. I also recommend reading the follow up book available through the author's web site. Some parts seem a little dense. I later dowsed this book and came up with only 500 out of 1000."
4,Insightful,This is a great book. Some of the information I had to read over more than once because the information was quite intense. It allowed me to better understand the current times we are living in and what is to come. After reading this book I had an incredible transformation. I have always believed that we have the power to will things into our existence by the words we speak. I referred this book to two other people and both of them find the book to be rewarding. It's a great book if you are conscious.
3,right use of well – healing and evolving the emotional body,"The book was in excellent shape and I got good service from Amazon.com. So I feel the book was properly rated and a good product.I was disappointed in the content of the book because it was channel wisdom and a lot of that is not wisdom at all but beings from other realms who want to get their names on the literary billboards.The whole book could have been summarized in one sentence. Divine Will is a Dimension of Creation we should all learn to live instead of embracing the whole tragic reality of free will. I teach Divine Will in my classes.

1,el Nino is el whack-o!!,"This is the most whack crew i have heard in my life!! I see why they are called Def Squad, because if you listen to their music, you will go def! HA HA HA!!!!!"
1,I believe this is the most wack CD EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,These dudes need to start with the basic and then try to make a record.
2,slightly boring...,"It seems like after Keith Murray's second album, all of Eric Sermon's beats just became 2 bass notes and a medium drumbeat. check Meth and Redman's BlackOut, and Redman's Doc's Da Name 2000 for more evidence. Eric Sermon is one of the best and most influential producers ever, but this isn't an example of why. All the emceeing is on point, but without the beats that's like saying you have a top of the range set of speakers, but a 4 watt system to use them on. Everything needs to be good for an album like this to be a classic."
4,"Redman, Keith Murray and Erick Sermon do it again.","The album is tight. The beats are solid, good if you wanna to ride to it or if you wanna party to it. The lyrics are on point, especially Redman and the revitalized Keith Murray. It's fun and they flow together better then other supergroups (like Westside Connection or The Firm) and they bring in their guest artists (like Too Short and Jamal) better then anybody not in the Wu-Tang clan. It just misses being a classic because of lackluster skits and it could use a little more variety but more then worth your money."
4,"If there were no radio skits, this would be a 5 star album","Okay, first I would like to say that this album could definitely be better. There are two things wrong with this album. First, there are too many needless radio skits that take away from the flow of the album. Secondly, there is no standout track which makes alot of the album seem repetitive. However, these are still three of the game's greatest MC's. There are a lot of great tracks on this album, and these three work really well together. If you are a fan of any of the three, then this CD is a worthwhile purchase."
4,"Def Squad, def album","With the exception of the played out WDEF radio skits with Nasty Naj, this album wasn't half-bad. For me, it was hard to determine whether Redman or Keith Murray was the best rapper on the album. Erick Sermon was okay on the mic, but that's already expected from him. His beats though were pretty decent; they weren't his best, but he came through. I especially liked the way he sliced up the ""I Got The"" sample to make the funky bassline to ""Final Countdown"" (featuring Jamal and PMD). My favorite songs are ""Check'n Me Out"", ""Full Cooperation"", ""Ride Wit Us"" and ""You Do, I Do""."
3,"Informative, easy read","This easy to read book not only makes a good instructional guide to finding a suitable martial arts school but gives a detailed personal account of increased self confidence and growth as shown through ""Joey"" and the other characters. Parents and gaurdians can greatly benefit from this book."
3,Light and readable,"This is an engaging story of young man whose life is changed and benefitted by studying tae kwon do. For parents and adults, the book is instructive on how to find a martial arts school and instructor. It's easy-reading style makes it a great book for youth, with good role models."
4,Good but not the greatest ever,"Alright, I still am a huge PJ fan, I will still buy their cds' and see them in concert. This dvd has some great aspects to it, but honestly I was hoping for a little behind the music of the band, and there is none. The only other minor disappointment was that they just played, you never get the feel of the music and it's just one song after another (not to mention they don't even put BLACK on there). I am still not upset that I got it, but I probably won't watch it much. You'd most likely want to borrow a friends."
1,Terrible quality,"The quality of both the audio and (especially) the video ruins any enjoyment this DVD can hope to convey. I couldn't get past it, and I refuse to watch a video from a band who claims to call themselves ""artists"". If they are actually ""artists"" then I believe they should do a better job with the DVD format - a fantastic palette."
2,Their live shows have slipt.,"If Pearl Jam really cared about putting out a great live DVD, they should put out something from 1994 or 1995, their Vitolagy tour days.Talk about boring, they don't move around much at all these days, and Eddie Vedder is just a shoe starer these days, not much character to his microphone perfromance.The music sounds pretty bad as well, at least compared with their records.Properly a good idea if they rehearse before going on tour."
2,Not what they used to be,"I saw them live about a dozen times between 1992-1994. They were one of the best live bands in the world, EVER! I haven't seen them in many years live - so I was really looking forward to this DVD. BORING! They don't have a fraction of the energy they used to. They are just stand there and play/sing. Not to mention, not doing their most electric performances live LIVE, BLACK, PORCH. But since it's their only live DVD, it's better than nothing. If they really cared about their fans, they would release something from 5-10 years ago. I would pay $100 to catch that on video."
1,Not that great.,"Pearl Jam are a great live band, but this tour is just completely bland.The performances look and sound lazy and uninspired, Eddie Vedders voice sounds totally short from to many cigs, and Mike McCready looks very fat.The only highlight is the more energetic European tour montage, with soundtrack.Perhaps they should of included one of those shows instead."
1,Is this a bootleg?,I read all these five star reviews and expected something awesome but recieved what seems to be no better than a bootleg. Eddie needs to learn how to sing live.
5,The best!,"this is an amazing video.I like to think to it as a documentary, in which friends of the band took the cameras and played with them. these people really know how the shows go on, and how the musicians behave. This is not just some payed professional recording crew, but like real friends. I've just once in my life heard from a friend how a Pearl Jam live act was, and it was on europe on summer 2000.... I had an ilussion of seeing a concert of these guys, and now I know how it ""fells like"" a little. Other thing, I've seen a lot and heard a lot of the bootlegs, the audiences in Europe were much more giving, you can tell. Maybe in the US shows people were colder. But this DVD captures the magic of a PJ show. If you are a Pearl Jam fan, and Pearl Jam does not tour in your country (Like mine, MEXICO) you MUST! have this DVD.Maybe this isn't Pearl Jam in the early 90's, but is still one of the best live acts!ps. dolby digital 5.1 sounds outstanding."
5,"the worlds best band on video, finally!","i am from germany and i was able to see their 2000 tour as well in the us as also in europe. although i would love to have a dvd with only european stuff on it(because i think they were even better there than in the states)this is a great one. you can see a band that plays music from their hearts, there are five normal guys able to create a warm atmosphere even when playing in front of 20.000 fans. so if you like honest, good rock-music buy this one! and don't forget to watch the bonus stuff from europe, you'll see why i loved them there!"
4,Good Stuff,"It could've been better. I prefer to hear some of the non-musical things that happen on stage. Like Eddie ranting about some Silly cause or just some other random thing. The concert is great though. Stellar Pearl Jam, check it out."
3,Exactly what you'd expect from Pearl Jam,"This video is perfect example of Pearl Jam's crudeness. Nothing this band does is polished, from the album covers, lyrics, and the rough edge sounding music. Which is also what makes this band special and great. Unlike other concert videos these were not professionally recorded or mixed and are quite raw. The picture quality is rather poor for a DVD. The sound quality isn't great either although it was true to their actual concert sound (saw them Portland and the bands sound quality wasn't that great there either). They only had one or two cameras recording and I got a bit frustrated with some of the camera angles. The set of songs were impressive and the roughness and style of the video did grow on me. I would recommend this video to any die hard Pearl Jam fan, just beware of the rougher production values. 1 star for sound and picture quality. 5 stars for set list and content. This gives us the avg rating of 3 stars."
5,Almost Perfect,"It is amazing that after releasing all 72 bootlegs from their Binaural Tour, Pearl Jam also decided to release this DVD, whis is absolutely imperative to have for all the jamheads out there. And it is a great DVD, with the performances and the European footage and the instrumental songs. My main complaint about it is the setlist. Where is Black?? It is just a staple song played at most of PJ concerts, but they didn't include a version here. I think the Vegas version is just beautiful. And I think they should also have included Baba, and Yellow Ledbetter, which were regular appearances towards the end of the North American shows. And what about Elderly Woman..., it is also a great live PJ song that should've been included. Anyway, I guess whatever the setlist was, PJ would never be able to please all their fans. It would take to release all 72 videos as well to do so. But this is still a great video and a great gift to their fans from one of the best rock n roll bands ever."
5,The best concert you can buy,"If you got tired by listening to all those bootlegs you bought, now is the time to buy this DVD. This is pearl jam like you have never experienced on a record. All the songs live up to the intense flavour of the live concerts. Touching moments, happy faces, intense rock, beautifull music and the only place where you can get the Oceans video. If you are thinking of buying a live dvd, this is the one to buy. You feel the concerts, each song at a time, this is probably the best PJ release ever. Don't miss out."
2,OK but please release another....,"Um... I'd much rather see an older live show when Eddie would actually move a little on stage and had a clear strong voice. This is pretty sloppy and boring. The mix is not great on the music either. I saw them on their first 3 tours and they sounded 1000 times better than this. You could really feel the energy and the tightness. This is just going through the motions, and not that well."
1,Boring - Awful Performances - Waste Of Money,"When Pearl Jam first started out they used to be an awesome band live!!!If you've seen the video clip to Even Flow, you'll see Eddie Vedder jumping around like a maniac going nuts full of energy, which represents the music, the same goes for the rest of the band.But I think ever since Vitolagy, Pearl Jam have decided they don't wanna rock hard anymore, they would rather stand round on stage playing their instruments and be boring and uninteresting.I bought this DVD and thought it would be good, but it aint.The Music is'nt performed well and Eddie Vedders singing is just blurted out tuneless mumbling and blabber.And Eddie Vedder should shave his beard off and leave it shaved off, beacuse on this DVD he looks like he's 100 years old.The Live at the Garden DVD, is'nt much better in fact its worse than this one, Pearl Jam are not great anymore they are boring, apart from certain songs off their records since Vitolagy."
4,dvd good,dvd good. like there. sometimes forget on couch. eddie vedder sings. stone gossard and mike mcready good. dvd fun to watch.
5,good book,good book i learned alot about hydrogen peroxide i think anybody interested in health and preventing and getting rid of disease should get this book its a good lil guide to have
