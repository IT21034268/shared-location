5,I love Rawhide,I'm collecting all eight seasons of Rawhide. I can't wait until the rest of the seasons are released. How could you go wrong?
4,Rawhide Season 5,Great show for those who watched this series as a kid back in the day. Great present for anyone who grew up in the 50-60's.
2,ENTERPRISE Theme Song But.....,The version heard on Enterprise is performed by Russell Watson and NOT Rod Stewart.
5,Truly Faithful,"I must admit, when I heard Rod Stewart sing this song from the movie Patch Adams, I really enjoyed it. It was the first soundtrack song I've absolutely enjoyed in years. I just don't know why Rod never put the song on any of his albums."
2,Want UPN'S ENTERPRISE THEME SONG BUY PATCH ADAMS CD,"If you an old trekie like me and you want the ""NEW"" Enterprise theme song you have to buy the Patch Adams CD"
4,Great music!,The theme to Star Trek Enterprise rules! Rod Stewart's characteristic voice quality makes this theme song unique. I like it so much that i bought a copy to listen to!
2,Too simple this piece of cake,"This book physically ""looks"" like a piece of cake. Pity that it's not mentally delicious. It may be good for a not so busy working lady with children, but definitely not for a 40+ married very sophisticated (or difficult) male who reads a lot, works over 70 hours a week with no kid. For those who insist, my final warning can only be: Please read the ""Excerpt"" before you buy it."
4,I WANNA PARTY ?,"The nice thing about this cd is, you could put it in at the beginning of your party and not have too take it out until the party was over at the end of the night. If you had too judge Theodis by the company he keeps, then there's none better, his friends do a really great job!If you like to move,then this cd will have you moving (and feeling it) all night long."
2,What Were They Thinking?,"I liked the original What Not To Wear, but this one falls wide of the mark. Some of the outfits are fine, but any woman who follows their advice for career dressing is a fool, unless she works in a very, very fashion-forward industry. In any reasonably conservative office, wearing open-toed shoes, fish nets, long, wrappy sweaters, and the like may get you dates, but it sure won't get you a promotion, a raise, or the authority you want.The success of the other outfits is hit-or-miss. In particular, I find a lot of their choices of headgear downright laughable.I'm disappointed in this book; it will end up on half.com very soon."
2,PRETTY BAD TASTE,"Clearly these talented women have a large following, as they are witting and sharp, and television style stars, but when it came the selection of outfits and articles of clothing that they chose to highlight in this book as ""What to Wear""? BAD TASTE is all that came to mind. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the level of style in both their ""good"" or ""bad"" options, as all of the outfits in this book are absolutely atrocious. No one I know would be caught dead in anything they recommend to wear for any of the occasions listed in the book. It is my understanding that all of the books they have written after their first book ""What Not to Wear"" are pretty awful, and derivatives of the first book. My recommendation: Unequivocally: PASS."
2,The title promises more than the book delivers,"Although I generally enjoy Trinny and Susannah makeovers, this book seems like a movie sequel where they should have stopped when they were on top. Many of the after outfits are not that great. I was surprised to see there was a chapter on appropriate underwear when it is quite obvious that they ought to read their own suggestions before taking the after picture. Wearing a sweater that obviously shows nipples as an improvement to a career outfit is hardly sound advice. Wearing shoes where one's toes hang out and over to the point of touching the ground is just gross. Pants that need to be hemmed. Lots of attitude, but just plain sloppy. An easy 10-minute 'read' if you can get it from the library or second hand."
2,What Not to Wear for Every Occasion,"This book features the cast of the BBC verison of What Not To Wear. I'm not considering this to be on my list of 50 books to read. It really is of no substance. There are pretty pictures and some helpful hints and tips. More events could have been done though. They outfits they do show are ones that will stay in style, but there are a few ""What were they thinking?"" Mostly in the wedding sections though. The stuff are age apporiate and they tell you which stores to shop at in your budget. However, money isn't really looked at in depth. Some of the stores they mentioned, I was unfamilar with and I live for fashion, clothing, and fashion magazines."
1,Horribly outdated,This was the worst fashion book I have read in a long time. It was very outdated and showed me that those girls must be intending to dress very very old women. It was disgusting.
2,same old same old,"unfortunately, just like their other 2 books, trinny and susannah fail to grasp the concept that there is no possible way that they both have every single figure flaw as all women. some of their advice is useful but overall this book was nothing special"
3,Shaping Individual Style,Pros:* Very practical tips for most shapes of women* Great illustrations to highlight points* Left me wanting more information on good styles formy body shapeCons:* Too general - I'd prefer to buy a book on only my body shape* The directory at the back is mainly London centred. It would bepreferrable to have local shops inserted for countries of purchase.
2,Quite a let-down,"I've enjoyed Trinny and Susannah's other books and picked up quite a few tips from those, but this book has me shaking my head. Worst is the career-dressing advice: it might be fine if you've got an entry-level position, but if you're at a managerial or professional level, forget it!For one thing, Trinny and Susannah seem to have a strong allergy to suits or, for that matter, any clothes that are conservative or classic. Well, trendy doesn't work for everybody, and it doesn't work all the time. Some of their ""don'ts"" work as well as, or even better, than their ""do's"". And some sections are overlong; do we really need numerous versions of skiwear and after-ski wear?"
2,Not what I expected,Perhaps it is because the show is UK based but I was taken aback by some of the after pictures. Alot of dresses over pants and very outlandish hats are shown as do's.Some of the befores don't look too bad other than the dated 80's look which I think we all know not to wear. I would have preferred more tips on handling body types rather than the obvious no's. They put in some really sloppy don'ts which aren't much help unless people in London are really walking around like that. We need more realistic don'ts as opposed to the obvious.
3,"Great Value, OK watch.","Purchased the watch because its in the price range I was shopping for. for this price range this was my choice of a few weeks searching. for around $200. us dollars its a fine looking sporty watch (my opinion). its automatic, so no needing a battery replacement. However, its made cheaply, so I am not expecting it to last my lifetime or anything. It is what it is. a nice looking, cheap watch that suits its purpose. It will probably scratch to heck from the cheap materials fairly soon. But Im not expecting much from it. Its not a rolex, but compared to other watches for 200 bucks, this was my first choice. I am a diver so i needed something watertight. I have dove 40x with it so far, in a few weeks, some light scratches on the bezel already. there was an almost impossible to see hair inside the watch glass when it arrived. almost impossible to see however."
5,Seiko Atlas (Landshark),"Looking for a good, affordable, ""bulletproof"" automatic diver? This watch has the venerable Seiko ""5"" (just Google Seiko 5). It is fashionable, trendy and a beast at everyday wear. If you love watches, you should definitely have one in your collection!"
2,"The watch is beautiful as it looks at the picture, except for a scratch on the bezel","You can find reviews about this watch from others vendors. But I want to complain here that I received this watch with a small scratch on the bezel!Of course it is not refundable because it is not in ""original condition"". No wonder why they sell it $20 less than other merchants. If you want to buy this discounted watch, be careful."
3,A very concise math review,"While the book has a fairly good math review and a good section on the verbal part of the test, I was disappointed to find that the quantitative questions I had been studying in the book were very different to the questions I actually found on the computerised GRE. If you are taking the test on the computer, look for a book that is specific to the CBT.Last but not least, if you can't stand really painfully dumb humour, this is not the book for you."
2,"Fun, but not helpful in real test!","I read it with great joy and fun, but the strategies the author provides cannot be that applicable to the real test because the major strategies in this book are pretty old. The code of modern CBT GRE is not that simply broken. Of course, it is true that first five (I think the first ten at least) questions are extremely important. But trust me! Do not rely only on the first five questions because ETS conders the most how many questions the test takers answer correctly. You can enjoy this book. But if you prepare GRE only with this book, I am sure that you will be greatly abashed. Math is good, but GRE math is getting complicated. For math, it would be better to review the Math section ETS freely provides through its website."
5,Great quck study book,"I am not a person to sit around for hours and hours to study. This book was great, because it reviewed all the basics and refreshed my memory quickly and easily. If you're a heavy studier, this book is a great starter book, then you can always read as many other books as you want. For me, I just read this one, and was quite satisfied with the tips and review it provided. I've reccomended this book to all my friends, who are going to take the GRE."
4,Great book,"A solid resource to walk you through--step by step--what to expect on this exam. Well laid out, and easy to read."
4,A Helpful GRE Supplement,"This book is geared for the computer test, and states that throughout the text. I'm currently using it to prepare for taking the GRE later this summer. I would not recommend it as your singular source of preparing for the GRE, but it has lots of helpful tips, hints, and strategies, that I feel it is worth the investmant. The author has spent several decades helping students prepare for standardized tests, so has a lot of experience, and insights into what she has seen work, and what doesn't. No book is going to singularly prepare you for the GRE, I would recommend at least three texts, to cover the three main aspects of the GRE, which are quantative, verbal, and analytical writing skills. This book could easily be completed in 2 or 3 weeks, if you spent an hour or two everyday going through the different sections. Plus, she has a great sense of humor, yet tells it like it is."
3,GRE for Dummies,"This preparation guide lives up to its name. Its quite introductory, and for some thats a good thing. But the sample questions included in the explanations were much easier than the real GRE test. I have not looked through more than a couple sections, so this is just an initial review.One positive is that this book was much less expensive. Its funny, well at least, funny for a GRE book. I also like the way the author sneaks in GRE vocab words(with definition) in her explanations. Good buy for folks looking for something more introductory..."
1,Don't even waste your money,"So, I just took the GRE today and let me tell you, nothing they discussed in this book was in the GRE. None of the formulas, vocab, anything! Ugh! You're better of just googling gre practice questions and checking out the different sites available. This book sucked!"
3,Math was Good but the Verbal needed some Help,"Although the intentions were good, the verbal portion of this book lacked a thorough definition section. The auhor tries to infuse vocabulary words throughout the text, and is succeessful in teaching those few random words, but the book lacks a much needed extensive vocabulary list. (If you have not taken the GRE yet, the verbal portion is littered with those hardly used fifteen lettered words like ""pulchritudinous"") As a person who has struggled with Math and excelled in the Verbal on standardized tests, I was shocked to learn that I scored better in Math than I did Verbal (A first for me!) On a positive note, the math sections were very helpful."
5,Extremely Helpful Study Guide,"I didn't have much time at all to study for the GRE, and anyway felt very overwhelmed by studying such a wide range of vocab, math, etc. I worked through this book and found it about as fun as studying can possibly be, and I suppose I am its exact target audience because I learned from it with ease. I understood some geometry for the first time in my life! I highly recommend working through this book as it will familiarize you with the test enough that you won't be so intimidated on test day. Life saver! (I took the GRE in October 2012, and yes the 6th edition is out of date, but all the same is helpful even though scoring has changed)."
4,All I needed to prepare for the GRE,"This book did a great job of helping to make GRE preparation seem reasonable. I went from knowing nothing about the GRE to 2-weeks later scoring a 1230 (670 math; 560 verbal). The only specific GRE preparation I had was this book. I highly recommend it. If you're someone who is looking for a 1400+ score, the only additional preparation I would recommend is the Barron's word list, which I didn't feel like taking the time to study."
4,"Good on Math, Bad on Verbal","I think this book does a good job of making you ""relearn"" math that you may have forgotten. I took several practice tests and got many of the math questions wrong. In high school, I had very good math skills. This book helped me brush up on mathematical concepts that I had forgotten. After reading the math reviews, I was able to get 75% of the math problems right.I still had trouble with the verbal section, though. I'm not sure why. I was a Spanish major in college, and my professors assumed that I would do well on the verbal section. But I didn't. The math part was much easier for me. I think it's because I use ""logic"" to understand languages, and logic what math pros use.Brandon Simpson"
4,Very Helpful,"I used The GRE for Dummies as well as the Cracking the GRE CAT (with CD Rom) to study for the GRE. Both had their strengths. In the GRE for Dummies, the math review was superior, the prefix, suffix, and root review was excellent; and especially helpful was the note that prior to studying, one should see whether or not the graduate school requires all three scores. I did that, found that I would not have to spend very much time studying for the analytical section, and was appreciative of the time saved. Using these two books, I did quite well on the GRE!"
2,Outdated,It is a good book but it is outdated. The math section is the best part of it. You are better of getting a book from another company like the princeton review until they update this book.
4,Review of the Dummies.....,"Nice breakdown of what the GRE is, how it's given, how it's scored and a great review of test questions with tips on how to answer when you don't know the answer."
2,Superficial,Overall the book although written in a fun language didn't get me into learning more and I ended using it only for making the tests inside and not actually learning from it. I would recommend a book that is more concentrated on a preparation method and focuses more on tips&tricks and methods to master the GRE sections.
1,Stick to Kaplan,"Being that it has been awhile since I have taken any math, I had heard the GRE for Dummies book was the best for brushing up. However, I have found it to be useless. Unfortunately, it lacks proper explanations and the examples are confusing. I have had much better luck using random math websites and Kaplan's prep book."
2,Should have gone with Kaplan (or something else!),"Let me start out by saying that generally I am a good test-taker. I am also an Honors student with a 3.9 GPA. I studied from this book and got a below-average score on the GRE. I do not attribute my score entirely to the book, but I do think I could have done just as well (or poorly, rather) on the exam without even cracking this book open. There are a few tips for how to relax before the exam than I did apply, but other than that, I found the book pretty useless. Now I have to shell out another $150 to take the exam again in order to have a shot at getting into graduate school. My suggestion is that you don't buy this book. Spend the little extra and get a book from Kaplan or Princeton Review. I hear they're much better at preparing you!"
4,Very pleased!,"This book gives a very thorough review of different topics that appear on the GRE. It also gives a lot of tips and other things to look out for. The math review is excellent. If you need a extensive review for GRE, this is your book."
4,Dummies being the key word,This book was helpful in explaining the areas where I needed to improve my skills to take the GRE.
2,"Okay for dummies, but not the rest of us.","Vlk does use a lot of humor which makes studying less painfull, but unfortunately it doesn't make up for the rest of the book. I used this book faithfully several months before taking the GRE and in the end did poorly. She encourages you to rush through the test, guessing if you can't come up with the answer in a short amount of time. Its much better to keep your eye on the clock as you go through the test and try to use all the time they give you, since if you finish early you can't go back. Since the GRE is only given on a computer now, doesn't it make more sense to study it on a computer? Her roots, prefixes, and suffixes is a good idea, but you need to couple it with learning the kind of words on the GRE, especially when knowing what just part of the word means isn't helpfull. I had much better results studying with a computer program, in my case the Princeton Review."
2,Don't bother,"I purchased this book last year and found it more annoying than helpful. The author's ""cute"" rhetoric was more distracting than helpful nor did I find any of her advice all that beneficial. The examples were overly simplistic and did not reflect the difficulty of the test. Her approach is superficial at best and downplays the rigorous nature of the test itself. This book was definitely a waste of money. The Barrons vocabulary list is far superior to anything in ""Dummies."" I am going with Kaplan this time and anxiously awaiting the new edition of the ETS book."
4,Pretty good,"I loved the author's jokes and formats of this book. I was disappointed in the lack of math problems to solve and that there wasn't any review problems after each math section, as there is with the verbal section. All in all, I'd recommend this book along with purchasing another GRE review book."
1,Out of date as of Fall 2011,"This book needs to be retired from circulation. I spend three long, wasteful weeks on this book. I am taking the GRE in 3 weeks (2012) and I have to start all over again."
2,Unsatisfied,This book was not up to par with the GRE Test. Most of the things that they say to study for were not applicable on the GRE..I ended up using a different study book because this one was not great. Unhappy :(The supplier though was efficient and fast! I was very satisfied with them.
5,If you're terrified of the GRE...,"This is the book to buy if you want a high score on the GRE. I bought this book on Feb 10, 2010 & got it sooner than expected. I didn't have time to study due to a busy schedule but because time was running out, I had to at least read the book & see what it had to offer (consider that I am no Math genius & that the verbal section is equally as bad). So I read the book from cover to cover once doing the practices and before you know it, it was time to take the test. So on April 16, 2010 I wrote my test, still as terrified as ever & what do you know? I scored over 1000 SOLELY because of this book.I highly recommend this book to people who know for a fact that they are weak in Math. You will not regret it. Grad school here I come thanks to The GRE Test For Dummies!!!!!"
3,An exception to the rule,"I bought this book hoping to especially improve my verbal scores on the GRE. I had taken them before and done really well in the math and analytical sections, but not so well in the verbal section. I studied the roots, prefixes, and suffixes, and unfortunately, I guess I just had a majority of questions where I couldn't apply them. And, so again, I did below average on the verbal section. I think the book is interesting and helpful. I guess it just doesn't work all of the time. It did, however, bring the verbal scores up somewhat, just not enough for me. I think if you are average in your verbal skills before studying with this book, you will be able to improve your scores. However, if you're like me, I don't think that this book performs miracles when you have weak verbal skills to begin with."
5,THE BEST RESOURCE,I received nearly perfect scores in all areas of the exam. The testing center Proctor noted that she had never seen such high exam scores! GRE For Dummies prepatory exams were nearly IDENTICAL to the ACTUAL exam. I cannot say enough about this book!
1,"Cant Rate, the shipper used bad carrier","Did not receive product, though did get full refund, This item was bought as a gift and did not come... BAD"
4,Very fun but mainly not because of its basketball,"This game is very fun because you get to do what you want as you freely travel from one part of LA to the next such as venice beach and hollywood. the streetball is definitely not bad, but really, 3-star, however the ability to roam the city doing whatever you want, from buying NBA gear to engaging in a rap battle or participating in a car wash, makes it an overall 4-star."
3,We love those NBA Ballers,This game is an excat clone of the original ballers its got new players with there new teams like Ricky Davis but what is bad is that you gotta unlock to get all the players thats a horrible decision If you just want to pick up and play and have all the players availble Tony Parker is not a locked character in the original he wasn't. Its also harder to build your house meter I dont know Im playing on the default diffculty called challenging and its hard. I think next time this game comes out they should make some gameplay changes instead of adding new cribs and make everything including cribs unlockable at the start. The game is boring once you get used to it a few games here and there is all its worth nothing spectacular if you bought the orignal ballers keep it because this game has nothing new for you to buy.
2,Silverstone computer power supply,As will happen from time to time the silverstone psu was defective. It is the luck of the draw THEY MAKE GREAT POWER SUPPLIES. HOWEVER AMAZON WAS QUICK TO OFFER ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN THE ITEM FOR THE FULL PURCHASE PRICE AND ALL SHIPPING COST. THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE. (BETTER THAN NEWEGG OR OTHERS) WILL CONTINUE TO USE AMAZON IN THE FUTURE AS A GREAT FIRM
3,Have not used product yet,"I was happy to get the product, however due to death in family I was not able to actually open the box until much later. After that I realized it needs an adapter so it can attach to the garden hose to use it. I am not sure if I just did not read that information before I purchased it or what but once I get the adapter I will update this review."
5,A great historical account of the struggles in the slums of Germany and the hardship is few Jewish surviors faced!,We will not forget!! And as I was too young to know first hand; I rely on these books and videos of information on how the survivors made it! And the losses we will always hold as historical facts! Such barbaric acts could only have been ordered by a sick and evil person; and all who were afraid to face going against him. Today I treasure the knowledge that my familial roots come from this era and how lucky I am to be here today and free!! I am proud of my Jewish heritage and do not hate the Germans because they were also victims and forced to do these unspeakable horrific things!!
5,Great Price Value,"Purchased a smaller size (3) for Christmas gifts. After consultation with our local Police Dept. plus my own research, I can reccommend this Brand is IMHO the best bang for the buck. Made in USA, very important, and used by L.E. Professionals nationwide. We now each have one each of the smaller version plus this one at the ready in each car. Good product to keep at hand everywhere."
3,Adequate remake.,"This version (I have NOT seen the original with Barbara Stanwick) is pretty routine. The music score is so subtle, it builds no tension. The acting is monotonous, and Loni Anderson looks pretty healthy to be playing such an ailing character. But, as the story goes, you get caught up in the premise (Loni overhearing her murder plot via phone) that you make it to the end. Has fine support from Hal Holbrook, as Loni's father. I suppose your better off with the original, but stick with Loni and you'll get a guilty pleasure."
1,Why Remake A Great Movie?,"I by accident found a scrypt of the radio play in a play book at my school library when I was about 9 or 10. I became obsesed. So when I heard of a 1980's version on tv I had to record it. After I watched the whole thing, I wished I haddent. So when I saw the origional version at Movie Trading Company on sale for $3.99, I bought it! Stick to the origional!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Might be worth a look,"The giant crabs who attacked the coastlines in the series which began with the superb 'Night of the Crabs' are back. But this time they are dying due to cancer caused by an underwater nuclear explosion, and as such are determined for revenge on the human race who caused their mutation.This is the last of Guy N.Smith's series of giant crabs novels and is unfortunately also the least inspiring, comes across as little more than 'another giant crab book'. There are a few remorable scenes, but it has a wearyness about it, as though the author just wanted to get the series finished and write something else.If you've already read 'Night of the Crabs' then read 'Killer Crabs' and 'Origin of the Crabs', which are the best sequels. 'Crabs Moon' is also worthwhile reading. 'Rampage' might prove entertaining to fans of the giant crabs, but don't expect anything remarkably new or different."
5,Enlightenment made clear,Truth of Tao was an unbelievably easy read that clearly explained Taoism. I especially appreciated the comparative analysis to Buddhism. The last chapters on applying Taoist principles were practical and facinating to read. The description of taoist temples and gods was amazing.
5,Wow!! An applied Philosophy!,"I've been reading philosophy and the Tao Te Ching since college. I 've never seen such an encompassing application of a philosophy to the daily challenges of life. The language is straight-forward and easy to understand, although what it says may be hard to swallow. It definitely pierces some sacred cows. It ties together why physical and mental exercise, as well as a coherent personal philosohy are important in life. Whether one is a spiritual person or not, the book could be quite useful, if not an eye-opener."
1,"Nowak, no way","A good overview of the subject, but for a more comprehensive text with relevant arguments that would help a one L in class, get Tribe's American Constitutional history."
3,"moderate work, too expensive","The author has done moderate work on the book. It is easy to read and conceptualize. However, the price is too expensive and definitely cannot complete with these following books (not exclusive and not sorted in any order)CPM in Construction Management (Pro Engineering)by James J. O'Brien, Fredric L. Plotnick (about $70 with CD including primavera, pertmaster, ....awesome)Precedence and Arrow Networking Techniques for Constructionby Robert B. Harris (about $70)"
4,No Way to Treat a Lady is a late 1960s beauty.,"The plot, direction etc. don't really have a chance, because they are totally overshadowed by the acting. This is a showcase for Steiger, Segal, and Remick, but is just crammed full of great character actors as well (esp. Eileen Heckart)."
5,A great New Yorker's film from the 70's,"An excellent cast with an opportunity to see Eileen Heckart as George Segal's Jewish mother. Rod Steiger is in top form as is beauty Lee Remick. The scene between Segal and Michael Dunn, as the improbable killer, alone, is worth the discounted price I paid for the DVD. This is also a treat for New Yorkers, born and raised, who would like a glimpse of familiar times and places not so long ago."
5,A Bravura Steiger Pereformance,"No Way to Treat A Lady reminds us what an exceptional talent Rod Steiger was. This dark action/comedy gives him a broad palatte to strut across, and strut he does, as a serial killer in a game of cat-and-mouse with a harried police detective trying to track him down -- George Segal. A taut and enjoyable film with humor and the beautiful Lee Remick, and an over the top secondary performance by Eileen Hechart."
5,Interesting suspense movie,"This movie seems to have gone un-noticed by many people, but we think it is a worthy, though a little old fashioned, suspenseful entertainment. Lee Remick is so lovely, and Rod Steiger shows off his love of the stage. We give it 4 thumbs up."
3,Very likable album of Madagascar music with great guitarist,"Njava is a Madagascar band made up of 5 siblings. Lead singer Monika and sister Lala have smoky alto voices, and brother Dozzy is up there with D'Gary and Tarika Sammy's Johnny as a guitar virtuoso. If you like D'Gary's music, give this a try. The music has a dreamy, mesmerizing quality. The songwriting isn't as strong as some other Malagasy bands. In particular, the vocal melodies aren't very memorable -- the guitar melodies are catchier. The CD includes two a cappella songs. My favorite tracks are ""Jiboty"", ""Vetse"", and ""Lahy Raty""."
3,single round watch winder,I was a little disappointed in the quality. The cushion that you put your watch on does not fit snug in the holder. Also the outer material seems cheap feeling. It is silent but if you want top quality this is not the gift. If you want something that is OK and works well then this is fine.
5,works great,This product works exactly as promised. We buy in bulk and then repackage things in smaller units. This saves us money because things do not spoil. The machine is very easy to use. We shopped around a lot before we purchased our unit. Amazon had the best price.
5,FoodSaver V2840,It's nice to find a product that actually does the job it's designed for. The stand-up storage makes it possible to keep it on the counter and ensures that it gets used more than if it's kept out of sight. A big improvement over the old one we had is the ability to control the amount of vacuum applied making it possible to re-seal fragile items such as chips. The only complaint I can find is that the bags are a little pricey.
3,"Seal it and forget about it, but not for too long","I am giving this product 3 stars today based on the fact that I have used it only twice. It is a little tricky to get my seal to look like it does in the pictures but I think that practice will make a huge difference.So far, I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to others that are tired of looking at freezer burn foods."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $,Definitely a waste of money because they are not reliable. A product that cannot be relied on to function and perform as advertised is not worth the Chinese junk it is made of. Works pretty well for the first few months then the trouble begins. Even after double sealing both ends you will find that the air has leaked in and you food is freezer burned. Plus the bags and jars are EXPENSIVE! My Mom used to stick a straw into a ziplock bag and suck out the air. That works MUCH better than these pieces of junk do. Their vacuum jars are the same way. They cannot be relied on- so DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON FOODSAVER PRODUCTS!
4,fred,"foodsaver v2840 is a good product. we have used it many times since purchase. the instructions from the manufacturer were excellent. the price from amazon was good ,although the same unit from COSTCO was cheaper. we are happy and have rferred amazon to other prospective buyers."
1,new bags,"i have been using the food saver system approximately 14 yrs. i bought my 3rd. machine about a month ago. found out from their customer service (seems from my experience that they would rather sell you a new machine than attend to your problem!) the only difference between the machines is the way it sits on the counter, 3000 series vertically and 2000 style horizontally with the higher nos. more bells and whistles. the guts of the thing (air pump etc.) are identical. now to these new bags, they are a ONE USE ONLY! and these bags are'nt cheap. the old bags could be reused many times. so beware this can get expensive over time, not the savings they claim."
1,Two bad ones in a row.,We'd been using an older model foodsaver for several years and thought we'd upgrade. We thought the new one was the coolest thing since sliced bread until it quit vacuuming after about ten uses. Foodsaver was very good about sending a replacement. Unfortunately it also quit working after about ten uses. Maybe we're just lucky. But we're done with foodsaver.
1,Works very well but has a long term problem,"I had mine for 2 years and recently the rubberized sides and back went bad (the black part on the sides and top that you see in the product picture). By bad, I mean turned and started to degridate. I store my unit in the box in a cupboard, so it is not exposed to anything that would cause this. I purchased my unit at Costco which accepted it back for a full refund (got to love their refund policy!). In turn, I purchased the newer all metal foodsaver 3835."
1,Another vacumn problem,"It a great unit when it works but I've had the same problems as others. Vacumn unit quits if even a little fluid gets in, which is hard to avoid (meat juice for example). Sent one unit back. Took forever to receive replacement unit which went bad a short time later."
4,Just what we needed,We have used this product repeatedly and have it out quite often. We buyfoods in quanity at times and this works great for saving meats and otheritems. We make spaghetti sauce and chili in large batches and thenfreeze for future use. We love it!
3,Foodsaver V2840,"This is certainly an improvement over the last professional foodsaver I had. Design is better, although the ""fold-up"" feature sounds better than it is. It is cumbersome to unlock, rotate and re-lock in position. It tends to fall over a bit due to balance. The ability to change the vacuum sensor for moist foods is nice. The heater bar in relation to the bag cut slider is still set up to waste a lot of bag space, this needs to be redesigned fully given the cost of replacement bags. If you don't mess with it, you end up wasting several inches of usable bag space each time. Overall however, this is an improvement over older versions."
5,My first food sealer and I am happy with it.,"I purchased this item on Amazon at a sale price of $103.00. This is my first food sealer and I am extremely happy with it. I was amazed watching do it's job. The only thing that frustrated me a little was putting the pieces of the unit together after opening the box. It does not come with very good detailed instructions. I was not sure what direction the vacuum bar went in. It stores easily in the corner on the counter or shelf, and looks sleek and modern. Perfect item for anyone who enjoys fishing, hunting and gardening and desires to freeze their foods for up to two years. No more freezer burn and throwing away hundreds of dollars worth of food. You can also purchase a variety of attachments that will also be wonderful to have along with this gadget."
3,Can't sterilize canisters,"Vacuum storage is great -- allows bulk purchases to be kept for extended periods. But don't try to sterilize all the parts of a canister. The container part can be safely cleaned in a dishwasher, as stated by the manufacturer. The maker also states that the lid must be hand-washed, but says nothing about the wash temperature. So when a refrigerated guacamole turned brown (for the first time), I knew the lid had become contaminated. I also knew that any temp under about 170F would not kill most bugs (like well-done hamburger). So I immersed the small caps from the inside of the lid in 180F water for 10 minutes. The caps distorted and were useless. The lids can still be used, but I can't rely on the safety of the container contents. Wonder how the maker sterilizes them."
5,Good Deal,Ordered the foodsaver because the price was as good as I could find. Everything was as it should be. Arrived on time in perfect condition and works fine. Can't ask for more than that.
4,save money by preventing freezer burn ....,"This is a great product for large freezer runs ... we buy in bulk ... this unit allows me to freeze products for much longer ..... when I emptied our freezer a few months back I found lovely pork ribs that had been frozen in early '06, not a single freezer burn blemish .. and they cooked up juicey and tender! :)"
2,"More money, same short lifespan as the cheap ones","This is my THIRD FoodSaver. I keep spending more for each new product, but none of them last more than a year or so. I keep hoping that the more money I spend, the better my chances are of finding a reliable product. Not so. This very expensive model is no better than the ones I purchased in the past.I give up. I'm just going to start throwing my food away again and forget about ""saving money"" using this expensive gimmick. Wouldn't it be nice if we could produce quality products in America again?"
1,Very disappointed in performance...,"Do yourself a favor and save your money! Used this item a few dozen times and now the unit doesn't seal. Truly not worth the cost! If you insist on buying a FoodSaver item, buy the cheap one so you can throw it away when it no longer functions properly!"
4,Super Sealer,"This is a very good food sealer. I have been using it for almost a year now, and it has simply exceeded my expectations. I have not purchased any of the peripheral stuff and just use the plastic rolls. Food is never freezer burned, which happens with regular freezer bags. It comes with a instructional DVD which explains a lot. The written instructions were easy to follow, also. The unit stands up for space saving storage.You will thrill at the results of your efforts. I wish it had on on and off switch, though. You have to unplug the unit between uses (or leave it plugged in). Really a nice unit."
4,Great product poor customer service from amazon,"This food saver is a great product so we purchased two for our children for christmas........a few days after delivery the price went down $80 for the two items and amazon would not even give an amazon credit..the items had to be returned and re-purchased....HOW'S THAT FOR GREEN!"" I will not be purchasing any items from amazon in the future. Thanks amazon for being green! UPDATE.....after speaking with a third person in customer service I am happy to say amazon did honor the new price and the balance was refunded.........no extra shipping no wasted fuel! Thanks amazon!"
1,unreliable,"i have owned 3 different foodsaver models.from mid-range to their best.each, after minimal use, stopped working.the company would not do a thing for me because they were a little past the one year warranty date.did not offer a discount on a re-pack or anything.the same thing happened to my son and 2 of his friends.they look great on the tv commercials. they are terrible. do not buy one.for reliable home use, do yourself a favor, spend a little more money and buy a weston brand.i doubt that you'll have regrets."
1,Buyer beware,My foodsaver unit stopped working after 5 uses. It will no longer vacuum the bags and is useless. Foodsaver said to throw it away because it is no longer in the warranty period. Beware. I'd buy from a more reliable company!
2,Poor Customer Service,"Product is fine, but good luck if you need to return/exchange vacuum or reorder bags. I placed an order the day before I got a promotional offer for 25% off. Tried to call and apply this to my order for additional bags. They can't do that, I need to cancel my order. I cancel it and reorder online, but receive the first order anyway a few says later. Call to figure out what's up, told sometimes when they cancel an order, it doesn't happen because they can't communicate directly with the warehouse that ships it out. And the internet division doesn't communicate with the phone order division (and neither, apparently, has contact with the warehouse that ships the order). Nothing I can do besides wait the week it will take them to send out a prepaid label and the two weeks to refund my credit card. All of which, of course, could have been avoided if they had just applied the promotion to my order on the phone like every other company I have ever ordered from!"
4,A book for sailor wannabees...like me,"I picked this book up before leaving on a cruise and sat on my balcony deck to read much of it.When I got home, I read in it each night before bed.It's a beautifully written book, has much adventure and describes the landscapes and ocean well. These men had to reach down deep to do the things they did and I admire them.I enjoyed the book and am glad I got to read it.Now I'm going to read Capt. Joshua Slocum's book...""Sailing Alone Around the World."""
2,Not really a book about Seamanship...,"Sadly, the character of the author, as revealed by his prattling narrative, does little to educate the reader regarding seamanship. Or perhaps, it serves as a warning and a signpost for other would-be voyagers on the type of character to avoid when going to sea.If this book had been written by George Fairhurst, perhaps real knowledge and wisdom of the sea might have found their way to warrant ink and paper.This is one of the least-enjoyable books on sailing I have read."
2,Agree - not for sailors,"Ughh... I found reading the other reviews far more enjoyable than reading this book. Unfortunately, my husband didn't read them before buying the book for me for Christmas. I am a sailor, and was hoping for a nice short read over a holiday break that would entice me to this foreign land. Instead I found myself drowning in what felt like forced prose.To be fair, I am also an engineer, and never particularly enjoyed all those Honors English classes either. It reminds me of one of those droning books I was forced to read, not something I would choose to read."
2,Sailors Beware,"Remember the scene in Saving Private Ryan where the literate but naive tech sargeant quotes Emerson to the Tom Hanks character about the romance of war? Well, here we have an amateur sailor showing his well-read background off while breaking every rule of the sea. George, the friend and hired hand, must have had his hands full with this sea pup, heading out into gales, riding dinghies into heavy surf. Really, why read this book? George has some interesting comments about managing anxiety, they meet some interesting characters, but what you learn is what not to do on a coastwise passage and never to sail with an English major with a great memory for quotes. Oh Boy!"
2,somewhat satisfied,This necklace was a lot smaller than expected for the price paid. Will not make any other jewelry purchases.
3,good text for benchmarking,An intersting book that presents a lot of legal history in regards to health care decision-making. Chapter 13 is a real eye-opener!
3,Not the sellers fault for my rating.,"I could not use this manual; did not reference my bike. My scoot is of a time period where the manufacturer changed configurations and I was unsure which manual referenced my bike. Once I compared the information to my bike's model, year, etc.; I never opened the book again."
5,Must have for 1994 Vulcan,"This book is definately a must have for the owner of a Kawasaki Vulcan. My DH is a mechanic by profession, however when we bought out 1994 Vulcan from BIL it had been out of commision for a few years. This book is essential for getting it going again. Don't know what we'd do without it."
3,ordinary,"Problem ... 9 inch saw blades are hard to find. My Rockwell miter box uses this size blade. So Vermont American , Thank You for making these blades. As for the blade ... it cuts and is OK ... not great but Ok after all it's not carbide tipped."
3,It's steel,"It cuts just fine until it hits and unknown nail. At this time, forget the sharp edge. I recommend a carbide tip."
2,Lockout: Ho-Hum,"Immigration acts, facts and proposals for the present US are surely important. However, we need a better job done on it than this book does. To be fair, this style of ""semi-reporting"" is popular and does sell; but, it's not what will do the job. It is full of the author's ""we shoulds"" when what we could better use would be ""given A, if you want B, and are willing to do C then do/support E"". The book is full of anecdotes, that we are not sure are representative, and of ""opinions"", of many ""non-government organizations"" and ""advocacy groups"". Read it to learn what is typical of what is out there. Otherwise, use your time more productivley to think and research the problem yourself and you will come out better off!"
4,Get immigration straight,"Many of the reviews posted here -from professional reviewers as well asreaders- clearly are not based on what actually is in Lockout but instead on pre-existing notions of what the author might have written.For example, how did the Library Journal reviewer conclude that Lockout does not address homeland security or the impact on U.S. low-wage jobs? There are full chapters devoted to homeland security and to jobs.Also, just because you don't agree with a book's conclusion doesn't mean that it's biased. In fact, from my reading, Lockout is balanced almost to a fault: delivering both sides of many of the arguments about immigration - the Borjas/Card debate about the impact on low-wage U.S. workers comes to mind.No doubt, Lockout makes a case in favor or immigration's net effect benefits to the United States, but it doesn't ignore the costs-- and suggests ways to achieve a more moderate and sustainable flow of people across borders."
4,Wucker Gets Immigration Right,"Michele Wucker makes an excellent argument for America's maintaining an open-minded and progressive attitude toward immigration. As she points out in her rich description of our history as a land of immigrants, America's success as a nation has been built on the ingenuity of immigrants. The mass immigration between 1870 and 1910, for example, led to a 24% rise in the overall economy. However, Wucker does not propose a free-for-all immigration policy but advocates a moderate approach. She also points out that by failing to appreciate ""cultural differences"" and ""the tremendous asset that our mixed heritage gives us,"" the U.S. will fail to function at the highest level in the global economy. Her advice: ""We need to build on our strengths and come up with targeted solutions to shore up our weaknesses."" I highly recommend Wucker's book as a prime source for ""getting immigration right."""
1,Not for oily skin.,"I have combination/oily skin and this product was very thick and left my skin feeling greasy until washed off. This is definitely not a light moisturizer. Not sure how it would work for those with dry skin, but I don't suggest it for those with oil. It is simply too heavy."
3,Somewhat Good for Dry Skin,"I love the very light fragrance. It's very light texture is great for sensitive skin. However, it may just be me but I have a small dry patch of skin on my eyelid that won't go away. I use Kiss My Face every day and night on my dry eyelid area and my eyelid is still dry. My face is somewhat smooth. I still have dry spots on my face. So I'm not sure if my skin is just too tough to soften up. I like this product but I wish it was much stronger for extremely sensitive and dry skin people like me."
3,"Overall, I feel that this product offers an ...","Overall, I feel that this product offers an excellent value based upon its size and price. I have combination skin and felt that the product was a little """"heavy"""" for daytime use; however, it made for a wonderful cream to use at night. Those with very dry skin may find it a good cream for daytime use. It makes no sense whatsoever to pay $20 or more when this product will perform!"
5,Excellent!,I read this book on a cross-country flight and found that I couldn't put it down. I really feel that I can apply the concepts in the book to relationships in and outside of work. I definitely recommend it.
4,Concice and brilliant.,"This is a brilliant condensed volume of information designed to inspire and inform the reader on the benefits of developing emotional intelligence. Emotional Intelligence is the basis of success, it allows you to cope constructively with no matter what ever life hands you. The online test also gives the reader greater insight into how their skills can be developed.Well done. I would recomend this to my clients and readers as being a no nonsense resource. I have studdied and worked with developing resources arround Emotional Intelligence for years and this is good.A great practical down to earth book which reinforces values ""A wonderfuly practical book that will change your life."" TRUITY Williams from Wanabelong, author of Workbook of Choices, Sweetest Revenge - a successful life and Feathers in the Mist."
5,Just great and needed,"Being intellectually smart is surely a strong advantage in our society, but it doesn't say nearly as much as your control and awareness over your own emotions. Have you ever wondered why you have emotions, how your brain works to process them, and how you can use them to your own advantage? I've never read a book that so clearly explains how it all works and what to do with it. This book offers an enormous variety of invaluable, fact-based information which is sure to help you with your relationships, your family, your career, and most important, knowing yourself."
1,Album cover beautiful,"Anyway-I personally believe Kenny fell off. His last album was the bomb***. I feel he should have done much better. Out of the whole last album, all of the songs were great. This album which I am giving away, I like three songs only. But don't get me wrong the guy is handsome....."
1,Wack!!!,"Days Like This is the bomb, but the rest of the album is terrible. Lattimore has a tight voice but he needs to get better songwriters and producers."
5,I understand the man.,"From the Soul of Man by Kenny Lattimore is powerful. This album came out right after my fiance called off our wedding. He said there were some things he had to do and understand about himself. Kenny's lyrics touched me so much that I understood what my now husband was going through and why he could not get married at that time. Kenny's words expressed the pain and fear and love that a man feels. I knew that there were no games going on because Kenny's words showed that men cry and anguish over relationships too. I would equate the album to Sadie's Is It A Crime...sad, sultry and oh so true! Kenny, I understand the man."
3,Not as good as the first CD,"Unfortunately, Kenny Lattimore is not as good a songwriter as he is a singer. After listening to the first couple of tracks, I knew that he had succumbed to the ""I want to write and produce myself"" syndrome. There is nothing on this latest release that can begin to approach the beauty and lushness of ""For You"" or ""Never Too Busy"", two tracks from the first CD that he did not write.Kenny Lattimore is an incredibly gifted singer, but he would be wise to leave the producing to others with a more objective ear."
5,Awesome!!!,"It's 2004 and I've just purchased this CD, I wish I had purchased it sooner. Kenny Latimore is definitely an underrated R&B singer. He has such great talent, his music is so smooth and mellow, you can listen to his music all day and night. His music is so deep. The title of this CD is definitely appropriate coming from the depths of his Soul. I had to listen to his version of ""I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know"" and compare it to the original Donnie Hathaway version,and I must say they are really close. ""If I Lose My Woman"", ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Tomorrow"" are my favorites, but the whole CD is slamming!!! I haven't been able to put this CD down since I first heard it. I play it at home, in the car and at work. It's very thought provoking as well as relaxing. Great Job Kenny! Keep up the good work!! I'm a fan for life."
5,The most underrated album of 1998?,"This album was the bomb! Kenny Lattimore deserved to go platinum with this disc, but it fell through the cracks and on deaf ears. Great cuts include ""Days Like This,"" ""Trial Separation,"" and the cover of ""My Guitar Gently Weeps."" Lattimore doesn't stoop to r&b chiches (heads-up, Joe and Sisqo!), and that's probably why he isn't as popular as he should be. Nevertheless, you owe it to yourself to give Lattimore a chance by grabbing this disc. You'll kick yourself for not discovering him sooner."
4,"Good tool, but not what it says it is","A good quality hammer, but this 5 pound hammer has a total weight of 4 pounds 9 ounces, & a head weight of 4 pounds 4 ounces. Oops! I used it to dismantle a stubborn half-shaft where the extra weight would have been a help. But in spite of abusing the hammer, it did the job & wasn't excessively beat up afterwards."
3,This was a simple book.,I liked this book but it was way to simple. I would suggest this to a 2 year old because it might be to easy.
1,Are they insane?,"Almost $300 for a little tiny book? These people must be nuts! I got a copy on e-bay, in a stack of other cookbooks, for less than $10. The recipes are fantastic, but look elsewhere for a copy"
1,Too Greasy,I had heard of these and thought I would try them. They were just too greasy. I don't like the way I feel after eating them.
3,Skull & Bones Expose,"What an extremely interesting book. I have read Anthony Sutton's book ""America's Secret Establishment"" as well as this one. Mr. Marrs takes you to the secret ceremony that George Bush went through, like so many before and since, on the night he was inducted into the Skull & Bones Society. This book will inform you about illumination of the masses by this society. If you find this book hard to believe, do your own research. But use this book as a tool to get you heading in the right direction."
2,Generous with 2 stars,"I'll give this book 2 stars, not 1, since it was at least entertaining.Seems as though Mr. Marrs has an Ayn Rand sort of grudge against the new age; LOL.At any rate, the book isn't convincing at all and is a discredit to the truth movement.-j"
1,Garbage,"Nothing more than paranoia run rampant and a complete betrayal of the principles of democracy and freedom - so what if a group of people have an unnamed god - just so what! To say that some secret brotherhood controls the world is as meaningful to say that little green men inhabit the dark side of the moon. Show me the money. Don't bother spending your hard earned money on this garbage, watch the X-Files - its more entertaining and takes itself far less seriously than this millennium hoo-haw."
2,NOT Woodsy,Nice scent but it's like so many other fruity/citrus/flower scents which seem so popular. So if that is what you want it's nice and the packaging is cool. Yet it was my choice to buy it scent unsmelled wishing the woodsy description was what I imagined.
5,colonia,"muy buen producto, excelente vendedor, entrega rapida y efectiva, me llego en excelente condiciones, agradecido por tan buen servicio prestado"
4,I liked ........,"I bought this perfume for myself. Packaging, appearance, odor, all very nice and charismatic. but I gave 4 star. because slightly shorter duration of stay and the price is constantly changing...."
2,Ring Tones from Ludwig?,"I enjoyed the Kodaly Quartet's CDs of Beethoven's first four string quartets. So, I purchased the CD containing #5 and #6. Unfortunately, in the recapitulation of the first movement of #6, there is an electronic ""jingle"" that is really annoying. It might make a good phone ring tone. I replaced the first copy, but the ""jingle"" was still there. Great music. Good performance. Bad processing. How does something like this get through quality control? The copies I purchased were made in the USA. Perhaps copies made elsewhere are free of this defect."
2,Another Code Red hit or miss,"Code Red is known for releasing some great (and not so great) titles, but they pick some really obscure stuff, and that's what's important. Marcy is not one of Joe Sarno's better titles, and Code Red's print is rough, but watchable, if you can get past the color fluctuation and continual print damage. There's a decent amount of nudity, but almost looks like a cut version of the film, as simulated sex scenes just seem to cut to the next scene without warrant. If you're a big Sarno fan, it's worth a watch, otherwise spend your time and money more wisely."
2,Dobro in the lounge,"My copy, which I picked up second hand in London, bears the title ""Mountain Shadows"" - more evocative perhaps than ""Mountain Light"". But as to the music, well in a kind of Windham Hill genre this is pleasant, relaxing, and a tad bland. The dobro can of course be used to great effect through a reverb unit. Here it is cast into a mountain cocktail bar format and will help you fall asleep accordingly. Maybe next time Pat - you can give your music more edge. Maybe not."
1,It is hard to believe that Jack Olsen wrote this book.,"We have always thought of Jack Olsen as the ""king"" of true crime, however this book is a major disappointment! It reads more like fiction that was written by the central character (the female Private Investigator). Either that, or Jack Olsen was totally smitten with the female private detective to the point that it distorted his own writing style. And, for those of us who love Jack Olsen, this is truly a crime. WE WANT JACK BACK!"
3,a great man's book,"I had five classes with Mr. Fleming in highschool, and everyday with him was like another book, turning its pages magically before us. He's the man you talk to for inspiration, and his mastery of the spoken tale is like none i've ever encountered before, and probably will never encounter again. It is a shame this book does so little to reflect the genius in this man. It hurts me to say this was a so-so book, because I idolized the man behind it, but in truth, he does not write the way he speaks. I hope future readers of this book will not judge the man by the book. But for a light tale to read in a couple of afternoons, this book does the job."
4,shoe stretcher,"They were delivered quickly, and did the job nicely that I bought them for. and I like the ceder smell."
2,"Nice stretcher, one big flaw","Attractive stretcher with nice cedar scent but cone which causes stretcher to separate is plastic. The metal rod that screws into plastic cone when being cranked bored through the plastic cone instead of turning it to make wood separate and stretch shoe. If cone tip was metal or stronger plastic, I wouldn't have had to return and would have rated a 4 or 5. Would only use for women's size 7-8, no smaller."
1,Not worth the money.,I used it once and the screw mechanism no longer works. I would advise not buying this product. there must be others out there that are better.
1,Broke the First Time,"So why didn't I listen to the reviews. I have another brand of stretcher that is wood and all metal, it works great. I needed one for my sons shoes so I got this one because the price was right. I used it to stretch one shoe and heard a crack. I had hardly turned it. Then the send one and the plastic piece broke into 3 pieces. So, I didn't even get to finish stretching one pair of shoes. I am now looking for replacement tips but am having no luck. Spend a little extra and get one with all metal parts."
2,"Cedar Shoe Stretcher with 2 Ortho Plugs, Women's 5-8","I order the Cedar Shoe Stretcher with 2 Ortho Plugs, Women's 5-8 back in July. I order 2 pairs and both of them broke right away. I really wasn't to happy. Plus the whole return with shipping and handling just didn't appear to me like worth the trouble since there is no guaranty the next pair isn't going to break right away as well."
1,Don't waste your money,This is only one stretcher (not 2) that is badly/poorly manufactured. I used it twice and it completely broke.
4,practical item,"Isn't is amazing how you order the same style of shoes in the same size and they feel tight? Well that happened with me and rather than take it to a shoe store to get the shoes stretched, I ordered this...What would make this item perfect would be that would expand not just across the top of the foot but also the height....One of the things I needed to know prior to ordering is if this item came in a pair or is a pair was needed... No it does not come in a pair but one stretcher can be used for both shoes..."
5,Works great!,"Made of heavy wood, and a heavy-duty metal screw to enlarge the stretcher. NO plastic parts."
1,Complaint about inferior product,This product's interior rubber part shattered into pieces the second time we used it. This product is a piece of junk. I would suggest you take this product off your sales list.
1,Item should be pulled,"Typically I carefully read and heed other reviewers advice. Somehow, I did not on this. Until you use it, quality seems fine. The wood seems sturdy and has a pleasant cedar smell. However, even with gentle use, it broke first time as the important internal tightening screw is cheap plastic. This product is designed to stretch leather. It should be sturdy and able to withstand the force needed to do this. This product is an excellent example of the fraud being perpetrated on the buying public by Chinese manufacturers AND the domestic sellers of their products."
1,Cheap garbage,"I specifically chose this one because there's no plastic parts. When it arrived, I found that the part inside (that the crank threads into) is plastic. It stripped out after just two turns, which is the recommended amount in the instructions. I got a refund, but I'm out the $5 for shipping."
2,Wish I had read the reviews BEFORE I ordered,"One of the shoe stretchers broke after the second use. These things are junk. Of course Shoe Smart will refund my money, but I have to pay the return postage - NO THANKS. I agree with the review that said, ""you get what you pay for""."
3,Good But...,"The stretcher works well, gets the job done, however.....the little metal tip at the end of the bar inside the stretcher easily (and wrongly) disconnects from the bar as you twist. It is imperative that this tip stays on the bar for it is the part that spreads the wood as you crank (follow?). It's an irritation you must watch for but other than that, it works fine (until it decided to not work anymore because let's face it, this isn't highly crafted and designed stuff we're dealin' with here). You need shoes stretched, get it. Even if it doesn't last long, it's worth the price."
2,Not the best...,"I purchased this shoe spreader for some shoes that I bought for my son. He isn't terribly forthcoming in telling me when something doesn't fit quite right. His folly was getting the narrow shoes in the first place. My folly was not asking the right questions multiple times and multiple ways.So here we are, with the shoe spreader. It's not wide enough. Even with the Ortho plugs in, it's not wide enough. I'm not sure where the receipt is. I wish I could return it though."
2,Not a well made product,"This order was shipped quickly. However, this shoe stretcher is not well made. The turning mechanism broke after two uses. I would opt for a better quality at a higher price next time."
2,item is cheaply made,This item is very cheaply made. Plastic internal parts that broke on the first use. I would not recommend this product
1,Incorrect sizing,"This item was too small for the shoe. Even with maximum adjustment, it did not fill the shoe. I returned it."
2,The Literary Equivalent of a Mugging,"Wow - what an extremely frustrating novel. On the one hand, for the first three quarters of the book, I thought it was absolutely delightful. Goldman's an excellent writer, is able to evoke the world he's writing about, and mixes both the comic and tragic elements masterfully. And then, about seventy pages before the end, it all goes off the rails.The mystery which most of the book has been building up to is resolved with an unlikely deus ex machina. The heroine and her supporting cast start acting strange and uncharacteristicly. And the last chapters make an awkward, poorly written shift from the third person point of view to the first.Really, as much as I liked Goldman's first two books, I can't recommend The Divine Husband at all. It should have been longer or it should have been rewritten one more time or whatever. Let's hope the next one is better..."
1,awful,Our book club was canceled because no one could finish the book. I got to chapter three and gave up.
1,Dumping the Divine dullness,I've made it to page 46 and that's it. I just can't justify spending any more time with this detail heavy tale.
5,More Than Love,"Quick about face, first Sir Anthony Dmitri Markham, hated Judith Lister on sight. Then he quickly reversed his actions. When he didn't seem to be able to make up for his rudeness, and get Judith to stay at the castle, he later invited her to be his grandmother's compainion. Judith took the job, but Dmitri soon blew hot, then cold until almost the last chapter of the book.From the back of the book: 'When Judith was only partially recovered from a bout of the 'flu, her friend Ann took her to convalensce at her godmother's fascination castle on the Northumbrian coast. But her convalescence was cut short by the chilly welcome of Lady Markham's grandson.'"
3,Too Much for Too Little,"I figured that with the hefty price tag of 75.00 this must be one great book. I love Britcoms, but ended up disappointed. The background information on the shows is fine and sometimes insightful, though these sections rely too heavily on quotes from interviews in various publications. The episode guides are well-written, but in my opinion a waste of time. The amount of space spent on those would have been much better used to give ""equal time"" to other Britcoms. There are only 13 sitcoms covered in detail (and I disagree with some of his choices, but that's just personal taste) while other more deserving Britcoms are only given a paragraph or two. If you can get it from your local library, fine, it's worth a read, but it's not worth shelling out the kind of money they're asking. Sorry."
4,Mitchum in his prime!,"I am a movie buff but for some reason I never saw this movie until I was in my 30's..a terrific movie by any standard. Robert Mitchum WAS in his prime here. This movie and Vincent Minnelli squeezed out excellent performances from Eleanor Parker, George Hamilton and George Peppard. This was some of the earliest performances in Hamilton and Peppards' career. I thought George Peppard nearly stole this movie in his role as Rafe...a great part...for a very entertaining 50's movie."
4,A Must See Movie,"This is a movie that reaches to everyone. It deals with pride and a misunderstanding of people. It deals with love, heartache, sadness, and loss. Robert Mitchum is the man who lives with a wife who could not be with him because of his bastard son, played by George Peppard. Their own son, played by George Hamilton, is weak and soon has a hatred for marriage because of his parents. The only one with a heart is George Peppard. Everyone soon comes to understand one another, but sadly it is too late. This movie is an excellent one for people who would just like an old story about the reality of life."
1,Flaws in DVD,"Received the item in what appeared to be ""new"" condition, but when we watched it, there were many parts that stopped and started and jumped. Several places we missed because of the quality of the tape. I had thrown away the outer package, so don't know how to send it back for a replacement, but it was definitely ""not new"".Please help me to get a refund or a replacement."
5,"On time, great condition!","The DVD I ordered, ""Home From the Hill"" was delivered promptly and in ""Like New"" condition. Thank you!"
4,Alpine IDA-X001 Digital Media Receiver,Works OK. Doesn't give the full feature when you press the back button. Some design flaws - Enter button is to the upper left of the big knob. The big knob itself should have been the enter button. Alpine's product development engineer must have been asleep that day. Another feature left out - wished it had alphabetical first letters of the artist name so you can skip quickly by jumping from A to P directly.Still having problems downloading special background from Alpine's website to this unit. Used USB flash drive to keep the file background but head unit just won't read & memorize it. Another Alpine flaw????????Amazon's price is very very reasonable for this unit.
3,"great deck, but a few dissapointments","cool looking deck, and its ability to decompress the file while it's streaming gives an amazing quality boost. However there were a few small things that i was disappointed about. The scrolling through artists (i have over 500) the held down scrolling takes waaaay too long, making most things other than playlists impractical on time.also, you cant go back one step in the selection process, ie: if you're on a song you cant press back to go back to the artist filter, you have to go allll the way back to music>>artists>>song, making the slow scrolling an even worse issue.So it's great quality, price, and aesthetically pleasing. But impractical on some things."
4,alpine ida-x001,"great product, finds ipod music hella faster than my alpine 9847, though i think my 9847 went louder."
4,No remote control and cannot rate the songs,"Excellent player, but you cannot rate (stars) the songs like a Ipod. The remote control must have to be included for this price."
1,missing pages,I picked up a copy of this book used. it was an older copy from 1986. it plainly says in the table of contents there are supposed to be at least 167 pages. it only has 120 pages.I just got back from Sedona. it is beautiful and we could feel the energy but it is a tourist trap deluxe. prices are outrageous.
4,A Good Resource,"Although dated and containing mostly older illustrations, this book comes in very handy for those times you need an appropriate illustration or story. Every preacher should have a copy."
4,looking for peace of mind,"Hi all, as you must guess the hunt for new sounds got me here, the name hedkandi a brit import, that got into my hands from a friend who cross the pound a few weeks ago. The veredict, well... I hate to be the one that tells things in this case, I love the first cd do not get me wrong, it is just too jazzy for me (listen to cd 2 to hear my point), my fav song has to be Santessa which really does the trick this time, I honestly would head first to the Real Ibiza, or the same Serve chilled by hedkandi first, that is assuming your concept of after night is kind of the one I have, the invest in this cd is well done but I still keep wandering for less jazzy noises and some nice house/d & b/ambient with smooth and intriguing voices strong vocals, not be missed the aim track and the herbaliser, happy trip."
3,Interesting but all over the place,"Some of the information was new and interesting, but I found the book to be very non-specific. In other words, it would be very hard to create your own health plan based on information from this book."
3,Not The Latest or The Best,"At least Ms. Heimlich tries to get to the real truth about alternative medicine, unlike Trodeau who only wants to make money by exploiting fear. Further study into the mind, body, spirit connection would make this a better read. Forget The Cures, Find The Cause would be a geat companion to this."
1,Dangerous scaremongering,"This cover of this book should read ""For Entertainment Purposes Only - Do Not Try This at Home"". It is as unreliable as the other book by this author, entitled ""Milk: the Deadly Poison"" - or something similar. It is also unreadable, deadly chunks of stoggy prose interrupted by highlights, boxes and exclamation points - each ""fact"" more wrong than the last. If you want to know about nutrition, Amazon sells dozens of very reliable and well written books (those for freshman college courses are usually excellent for the general reader) for other medical/health issues affecting adults and children, there are also hundreds of good books - Reader's Digest, Dr Spock, for example. Perhaps not fashionable and without such a hysterical title, but MUCH better value."
4,Nice b-sides,"I haven't heard the Arctic Monkeys' debut album yet, but judging by the quality of the b-sides, this band may actually justify the hype. ""Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts"" is an absolute gem, with Alex Turner playing the wry outsider in the grand lyrical tradition of Ray Davies and Paul Weller. Maybe even better than ""Dancefloor,"" but in a completely different gear. ""Chun Li's Spinning Bird Kick"" is a fun (love the geeky Street Fighter reference), tossed-off instrumental. Pick this up for the stellar first two tracks. The album's right around the corner!"
5,Monkeys Take America!,"No doubt this band will be hyped in Filter and Spin over the next 12 months, but for once the hype will be justified. The best single of 2005 by miles and THE best new band in Britain. From Sheffield so forget any prententious London aires and graces, better hooks than Franz Ferdinand, more focused than the Libertines and are set to give Oasis a run for their (vast sums)of money. Coldplay - forget it!"
4,Amazed!!!...,"I was first introduced to this record by a friend.. who was talking so much about this band. Then I download the full album, and I was really pleased.. Yes, it is in the mood of a lot of the recent bands (eaning: bloc party, franz ferdinand, we are scientists, etc). However, it also has a special indie vibe, very english style of singing!. The first 4 songs really rocks!, you can't hear them without start headbanging and moving ur feet.. If u want to download a song to start hearing about the I recommend ""The view from the afternoon"" and the live performance they had on KCRW podcast@itunes. And yes be prepared to hear about them for the rest of the year, to appear of the NME,Spin, and rolling stone covers all around the world...."
2,It's a DVD-R,This is a DVD-R and looks like a home recording. Save your money for when it actually gets a professional release.
2,'Gator Bait,"Awfull acting, trashy script and lowly directing. Claudia Jennings was beutiful and just only reason why to watch this movie!"
1,This is just a propaganda piece,for racialists and conservatives who want to prove that black and mixed race black women are less attractive than other women. It's been peddled by so-called scientists from the 18th century to the present. This book ratifies alot of racist/sexist stereotypes of people of color and women I read since high school.I'm just not feeling this book. Sorry!
4,"They've told you plenty of times, they're soldiers","The first all-No Limit compilation catches the label's rappers in their primes as is best examined in the sequel to the TRU song, ""NO LIMIT SOLDIERS"". ""NO LIMIT SOLDIERS 2"" is labeled as MASTER P featuring C-MURDER, FIEND, MAGIC, MR. SERV-ON, MIA-X, BIG ED, SILKK THE SHOCKER, and MYSTIKAL. The album features songs by the above mentioned artists and others. Includes ""WHERE DA LIL' SOLDIERS AT?"" which is an uncleverly rehashed ""HOT BOYS & GIRLS"" by LIL' SOLDIERS rather than MASTER P, ""GANGSTA MOVE"" by SNOOP DOGG, ""THE ASSASSIN"" by BIG ED, which is a remix of the album version, and ""GHOST IN THE DARK 2,"" a sequel to the GHETTO COMMISSION's album version."
5,"Man, I love everything Y'all do","The stuff nolimit rap about is real. Why didn't mystikal come back with nothin when U.N.L.V made that song about him? Most people I know love nolimit and what you do, can you end me some thing?"
1,no limit you may have found your limit,"to put it bluntly this album sucked. it's not up to the standards of no limit. i agree with the guy that said it earlier,""quality not speed in the albums coming out"" now no limit has had about 2 solid years with klc and beats by the pound, but beats by the pound just flat out sux now. i wish they would go back to al eaton there original mc.i personally also think that that last couple albums just have sucked(Mac,We cant be stopped and silkk's new one) and i would also like to bring up the issue of snoop dogg. snoop is a great rapper. but he doesn't have the ""dirty south style"" he's too much of relaxed lazy ""wicked west coast"" rapper. i hope when suge Knight gets out of jail he can get snoop back. TO END IT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THIS: MASTER P BETTER LEARN SOME NEW BEATS OR SLOWLY THE FANS WILL LEAVE. i mean i think in future Cash Money Records will give no limit all it can handle and more on the rap market. and remember where your heard it from!"
3,WHO IS FREEDOM,this cd is ok i just don;t understand why in song 17 freedom who is on a million dollar label decides to start rap wars with BLACK DOOM of HUNG JURY who isn't even with a label yet.he can't compete. has he released anything yet cause i have'nt heard about him since?
1,Not up to No Limit's Standards,"Out of 17 tracks, only Snoop's track is any good. The next track by Mia X is the worst No Limit song yet."
2,"OK, but no limit needs to work on quality,not quick releases","I LOVE NO LIMIT, but this album is just OK there is a hot Snoop Dogg track but the album lacks quality, MP and his crew should focus on Quality Tracks, like many of the No Limit albums, too many get release too fast, slow down and focus on quality! By the way if you are looking for a No Limit album, try Snoop or Master P"
1,MORE DUMB MASTER P CRAP,"WANNABE P AND HIS COMMERCIAL SOLDIERS STRIKE OUT AGAIN ON THIS COMPILATION. THE TRACKS HAVE LACKLUSTER BEATS AND LIL' KID LYRICS, I THINK ONE OF P'S NEPHEWS WRITES THE LYRICS. I find this album to be very unsatisying and quite a waste of money. AVOID THIS AND ALL OTHER NO LIMIT ALBUMS, EXCEPT MYSTIKAL, WHO'S ON TILT."
4,This album show cases the talent of rappers from No Limit.,"This album is tight. It starts off with No Limit Soldiers 2 a tight cut with No Limits best rappers. Then Mystikal had a nice track, so did Snoop. Another tight track was Heaven 4 a Thug. The production was tight throughout this album. You need to check this out."
5,"Just 1 world to say ""tight""",I am a big No Limit fan and this album is just another great hit by them. No Limit Soldiers 2 is the sweetest track on the album. Master P's part is to short but its sweet. Mystical whos part is last has the best part. Mia X repeated words complement her rap style. Lil' Soldiers song is sweet if you listen to the lyrics. But don't take from me buy the album and you will hear it for yourself. Anyone who disagrees please E-Mail me.
5,No Limit Soldiers MIA,"No Limit, get your posturing asses out of the way. You're just giving rap a bad name. From your xeroxed cd covers (can't think of more than one photographic pose? or maybe just don't want to try and think up more than one layout) to repetitive, banal lyrics and horrible sample choice, No Limit just blows fat goat all the way. You want quality rap, you go to Bad Boy, baby. Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad boys, they make you feel so good.. whereas No Limit just makes for a good aid to induce vomiting. No Limit.. to how low they'll go."
1,Wall heater that can't stay on the wall,"The ""bracket"" to hang this product on the outlet can't hold the weight of the heater. There are no screws/mail/or instructions on any other way to secure this heater on the wall. Therefore it is NOT a wall mounted heater."
1,Falls off wall. Will not stay on. They need to fix or don't buy.,I read people's review and the only problem was it falling off wall. I just though the people weren't doing it right or they didn't have a standard plate size. All I can say is that it uses a plastic 3 prong piece that is junk. I would return this heater except I threw away the box. I would suggest that you don't buy.
1,Won't stay on wall,I had to return this item on the day I got it. The mounting bracket doesn't work at all and the heater falls off the wall as soon as you try to mount it. It is very poorly designed.
3,really cheaply made,This heater works well but for some reason the fan speed switch hits the inside of the housing and stops it from going into the highest speed.I find that this hangs on the wall fine. Other people complaining must have kids that are using it as a jungle gym?It's really cheaply made. If I could get my $55 back I would.I wouldn't recommend buying one. There are so many better heaters out there.
5,Love this product,I love this product. Keeps the bathroom toasty since my builder so fit to leave out a furnace vent in this room.
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"This is the 1st item ever in life I am returning from an Amazon purchase. Yes, it is true, this heater is not fully secure/stablized on the wall. When I phoned ""Grady Online"", they refuted such a thing could ever happen and the customer rep wasn't even close to pleasant. Customer svs. was lousier than the heater. I told them others had stated the same problem on Amazon Reviews, which this female rep conveniently did not address. So they are making me pay to return their dysfunctional product! ""Grady's Online"" needs to make a better product and hire better customer service reps. I can't wait to get my refund because it's not worth it!"
1,Cheap but not well engineered,"This is a relatively inexpensive product but is so poorly engineered it was not worth the savings. For example it comes with a PLASTIC mounting bracket that is supposed to lock into a conventional duplex plug receptacle. It is so cheap and flimsy that it barely holds the fan unit in place. If you don't use two hands, one to hold the fan housing and one to switch the unit on, the whole assembly falls of the wall!!!! Buy a stand alone VORTEX unit for a few more bucks."
1,WARNING - VERY DANGEROUS HEATER! DO NOT BUY THIS THING!,"I would rate this with minuses if I could. I used it for a short period of time, perhaps 30 or so times at the most to top off my bathroom so I could shower comfortably. This morning I tried to use it and IT BURST INTO FLAMES! SO glad I was standing right next to it when that happened! It has never been dropped or kicked or damaged or mistreated in any way. I have used many electric space heaters and never had anything like this happen before. It stank up my whole apartment and would have burned it badly if I had turned it on and walked away. Thank God I didn't - with my daughter, her husband and two precious grandchildren right upstairs, I'm so glad I didn't walk away from this horrible heater after I turned it on this morning!"
2,Good product,This is a good product that does exactly what it's supposed to do - heat a small bathroom. It hangs securely on the wall and fits well in a small space.
2,"Had, but replacing-doesn't heat fast enough","In a winter home in Chicago, where the bathroom is chilly--this takes about an hour to heat up to take a shower. Wayyyyy toooooo long for energy savings. Absurdly long. So I'm replacing with another. Probably okay in a Florida or Arizona."
5,Works great very pleased,Works great and was able to connect with no problems.Noticed others have complained about the way it connects to the wall.It has a plastic lock that uses the lower AC socket and some have said it breaks.You can also put 2 screws into the wall to hold it in place and make it very sturdy. Would recommend to others
4,The Last Brickmaker in America,I thoroughly enjoyed this production. We need more family type movies of this caliber. Mr. Poitier delivers a very believable character with many human strengths. I would recommend this movie to all.The Last Brickmaker In America
5,The Last Brickmaker In America,What a wonderful story. Too many old trades our now gone and forgotten. This was a real art.
5,Great movie on mentoring,"I saw this movie when it first aired on CBS. I waited for it to come out on DVD for a long time. I wrote to the producers asking for it's release. Apparently many others did as well. Sidney Poitier did a great job, as usual, as did the other actors. It has a great story line and demonstrates some wonderful aspects of mentoring. I even wrote a study guide for it that I have shared with different groups. It is a great family film and I would highly recommend it."
5,great movie,"this is a very good movies,we watch it again and again.recemend it to all,good family movie.good story line.helps kids learn values"
2,Vermont American 6-1/2 Combo Circular Blade 25207,the blades were not that good. they wear out easy dull fast. would work on well (CURED) dried wood. What you get form lowes or Home depot is too wet for them.
4,"Great, but it's best to buy ""The Complete Piano Music of Scott Joplin""","What do you get when cross a modern interpreter of Joplin that makes even the most stingy of listeners stomp their feet and dance to the rags and marches of over 100 years ago?Easy, John Arpin!You won't regret this purchase, but for a few dollars more, you can get a nice 4-Disc Set the of Joplin's COMPLETE piano music fantastically played by Arpin.When I found out about Arpin's passing, I bought the album I mentioned above because I felt like I owed it to him to own as much of his Joplin recordings as I can.There will never be such a great Ragtime Pianist. The 'Chopin of Ragtime': John Arpin, will only let you down if you don't fully understand that music is meant to be interpreted, not played the same way every time.Brilliance in music. Amazing sound quality, and rich piano music that will entertain you for hours on end."
2,okay,"this book is very simple and plain. The kids like the pictures and can select a recipe to make by the picture. However, it is the very basic cookie recipe that actually does not taste that great."
3,Slippery,"I will admit to being a less-than-avid card player. I'm using these cards to play Contract Rummy, and I'm using three decks at a time, but even shuffling a deck and a half at a time, these cards are extremely slippery. They're frequently sliding around on each other on the table or falling on the floor if not held together carefully.They're really sturdy and a dream to shuffle, but if you're using them on a kitchen table or a other surface, or even if they're just sitting on top of each other, they do tend to slip and slide."
3,white spots,"I have the Pinnacle decks 1 red and 1 blue(set) The printing is a little washed out, which I understand with plastic. I have been using them for about a year, 4 games a day, there is 1 card in each deck that have 2 1/8 inch diameter white spots on 1 of the Ace of spades making it a marked card. Curiously its the same card in the red and blue deck 1 only the other is fine. They are truly washable and firm, do not get bent fron shuffling. But I will have to replace because of its 2 marked cards."
2,Plastic playing cards Copag,Did not last as long as I would have liked them to last. Started sticking after using for a few weeks. Not worth the $15.
5,Great plastic cards,"We have a regular weekly poker game, and these hold up great for about two years before they get worn down and we need a new set. They are also flimsier than the paper ones, it takes a bit of getting used to but it makes shuffling/dealing much easier.They have never been warped, something I can't say about the Kem cards I've bought."
1,Really thin,"We have a poker game thats been going on for 20 years now. We decided to try a set of plastic cards instead the Bee cards from Costco. I bought the Da Vinci cards. We were happy with them. They lasted nearly 2 years. All they needed was a washing, but the instructions on washing them made it seemed time consuming. So, I thought I'd try a different brand based ont the reviews. They arrived and they are VERY thin and flimsy feeling. I returned them and ordered a set of the Da Vinci cards."
5,Excellent cards,"I ordered these after trying the DaVinci plastic cards (which have a tendency to crack along the long side after several hours' use). The copags are wonderful cards- flexible, easy to shuffle, don't have that slick feel some plastic cards get, and are easily washable. They replaced the DaVinci's I was using, and I am now a die-hard Copag girl. They may cost a smidge more, but to my experience they are far more durable and just have a better feel to them- on durability alone I would say they are a far better value than the other brands. I have been using the deck I have now for 2 years (semi-regular weekly ladies night poker tournaments), and none of the cards have any damage- they all still look great. So- very much worth the price. Considering what I spent on other brands/decks before settling on the copags, I would have been better off just paying twice the price for the initial decks of copags (would have still saved me $25 bucks). Heartily recommend."
4,Copag Poker Size Regular Index 1546 Playing Cards,Very good playing cards.Best I have ever had.Proably more expensive than I would have liked.
2,Cards became warped.,"I own four sets of these cards. For whatever reason, these cards tend to warp slightly. One particular set has warped to the point that there's about a 10 degree arc along the short side (making it even more noticeable). My guess is that these cards couldn't handle the heat (it reaches 90 degrees in my room, where I stored the cards).The other three sets are warped to a lesser degree, but there's still a bit of a curvature.This wasn't a problem with my KEM cards, which were stored in the same area and have not had any problems.If warped cards aren't an issue for you, go ahead and buy these over KEM cards. They're both extremely sturdy and the copags are a bit cheaper to boot."
3,Hands Free Volume Issues,Difficult to control speaker volume. Have to reset volume each time the device is turned on.
5,Performs well. Quality name,"Replaced my fairly - new but OEM anemic coil with this one, and also replaced the (fairly-new also) OEM Delco wires with Accel wires -- it made a VERY noticeable difference in performance. Strong spark, and is not at all affected by humidity or rainy conditions.Great product."
1,Started leaking oil after a year,Installed on a hardly driven 73 Mustang with duraspark installed. I think I got 300 miles from it and it started to leak out the oil. What a piece of garbage. Glad it didn't strand me somewhere in the middle of the desert.
1,Don't buy it,"It's real crap. It looks nice, but after about 5 miles I got a major misfire. Managed to limp home and replace it with the original coil. Luckily, I didn't try this junk until after a 600 mile trip or I would have been stranded in the middle of nowhere."
4,A Cd that rocks and very awesome.,"Man I've had this Cd for a couple months and its basically all I listen to because it gives an inspirational feeling with his vocals and the wildest guitar and background work ever! If you don't pick up this Cd, you're going to miss out on something radical!!! Don't hesitate, JUST DO IT!"
2,Babylon Zoo 2nd and last album - poor exit,"The first album (The boy with the x-ray eyes) is way better! The music on the ""King Kong Groover"" album is hardly worth listening to, and the price of the album is way higher. This album is more of a collectors item."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,"(...) The first chapter of the book is good and if Ford could've kept on writing like that I would've enjoyed. There is zero character development in the entire book beyond the narrator, Pharnaces, occasionally getting mad at his father Mithridates for inexplicable reasons. The author claims many times that Mithridates was Rome's most formidable enemy ever, but if I hadn't already known of him from my own research, the way that Ford paints him is an absolute failure. Only once or twice does Ford really tell of any of Mithridates' victories, saving much more space for his losses and describing how physically massive the man is every couple of pages."
3,A GOOD HISTORY LESSON BUT NOT A GOOD NOVEL,"I hadn't heard of King Mithradates the Great of Pontus so, from an educational standpoint, THE LAST KING was worth reading. Mithradates suffered some of the worst luck imaginable in that three of Rome's greatest generals commanded armies against him. Still, with determination and intelligence, he managed to be quite a thorn in Rome's side for many years. This is basically the story Mr. Ford tells. As history, this is an easy lesson to absorb but as fiction it is not up to the caliber of good historical fiction because, mainly, the characters and dialogue are comic bookish. Despite King Mithradates's son being the protagonist and the story viewpoint being from the Pontusian side, I still rooted for stodgy, efficient Rome. In other words, Mr. Ford gave me little reason to care for those people. But the story moves fairly quickly and several of the the battle scenes are very well written. Three Roman legions out of five."
2,The Last Book: Ford's Greatest Disappointment,"Ford seems to be running out of new ideas. This is another book written about a historical figure through the eyes of someone close to him. It worked well enough in ""The Ten Thousand"" and made for an amazing read in ""Gods and Legions"" but this book doesn't come close to the standards of Ford's previous novels. I can only imagine how his new book ""The Sword of Attila"" will disappoint me. Ford should stick to writing about Rome through a roman's point of view. Do not buy this book."
2,Boring,"A poor man's Pressfield novel. I wanted to like it - but it just didn't happen. Too much narration, no character development - 8 dollars I'll never get back"
2,Constant battle,"I know generators are a challenge to keep functional, because they sit idle most of the time. So I used fuel stabilizer and cranked the thing up every 2 months. Still it wouldn't start when needed during the Nashville flood 2010, had to get fuel line unclogged ($80). Power outage this month, and wouldn't start again. Reliable small engine shop tells me it's actually a Mitsubishi engine,....that B&S had some arrangement to buy engines from Mitsubishi. And the carburetor has gone unrepairably bad (after total of about 2 hrs run time!). Carburetor cost $250 from Mitsubishi, plus installation charge. No thanks. I guess I'll just live without an emergency generator"
4,Quite an excellent reference,"I found this to be an excellent reference with two caveats... after buying the book online I was mildly disappointed to discover the cover illustration was in no way indicative of the interior illustrations. The entire book consists of line drawings and B&W photos, most poorly executed, but adequate for the purpose of the book. Second, the book slights the 17th century and is really more useful to readers interested in the ships of the 18th century. Otherwise, the information provided is substantial and a good companion to Nelson's Navy."
5,The Best,"I have bough several books on this subject and they were all recommended by master ship builders from around the world and they are what you need if your planning to scratch build a model ship,historian or just interested in sailing ships"
4,It grew on me,"If you are looking for Marvels or Manguas, pass on. You won't find what you are looking for with Incal. Incal is in the French comic books tradition. The story takes place in the future on a planet that you have never heard of before. People live there on levels. The closer level you are from the outside of the planet, the wealthier. Difool, the hero, lives at the very bootom. He is a teenager learning to live in his world and finding a planet-wide conspiration from its government. Action, spy, a little character to accompany him. This comic has grew on me has I was reading it. Not as good as Travis or the XIII and Largo Winch I like, but I bought the #2, so that must mean something ;)"
1,Wireless Guitar,"I hate this guitar, I spent way too much money on this to not have it connect for even one full song! I don't know why it can't maintain a connection, but I would suggest NOT buying. It's a waste of money!"
2,Not at all like the real LSAT!!!!,"This book, while teaching good techniques offers questions and exemples not at all like a real LSAT! He says in his book that these questions are similar. But they aren't all. His are childish when compared to LSATS! The book is good for ideas but his questions are so flawed in how they represent the LSAT."
1,Unnecessary frustration,"My satisfaction turned to red-faced outrage as I discovered an answer to one of the tougher logic-game questions to be ""wrong,"" with an explanation that MADE NO SENSE.But that's because there are mistakes in the book. Imagine that. This oft-cheeky and blithely-clever text fails.""Hackney"" is only half the story: It sets you up to get wrong answers. I would have been better off spending $19.99+tax on a sweatshirt for a dog-- and I don't even own a dog!I am now dumber for reading 70 pages of ""LSAT for Dummies.""And I certainly won't be picking up ""Baby Massage for Dummies."""
2,"Bad, bad, bad",This book IS a waste of money...I suggest going to the Grammatix.com website for REAL help.
3,Really Helpful...Until You See an ACTUAL LSAT,"This book does an excellent job of making the LSATs seem simple. It provides commonsense and ""zen"" strategies that work perfectly well for the sample problems provided in the book but unfortunately they simply don't translate well to the actual test material. They do say in this book that it is only helpful if used in conjunction with actual LSAT practice tests which I absoutely agree with. While it does provide some interesting insights and approaches and make you feel like you are completely capable of nailing the LSAT it drastically overly simplifies what is involved in answering LSAT questions and will leave you stunned on test day if you don't use other methods of preparation. In short, it's a good book to flip through when you're feeling overwhelmed by study material or having a panic attack, but should only be used as some light reading to supplement your study routine."
1,Not worth the money,"Please do not make the same mistake I did -- this book was awful. It had a lot of misinformation and actually had wrong answers in the testing section explanations! It was very confusing, to say the least. Do yourself a favor and purchase the print version of Master the LSAT by Jeff Kolby and Scott Thornburg -- it provides useful guidance and a lot of help with the games section."
2,Prep Book,LSAT book for dummies is not a good tool for the prepping part of the LSAT. I would not recommend this boom at all.
2,Not Worth Your Money,"This book, while clear and encouraging, simply isn't worth your money because the questions are too easy. I thought I would breeze through the LSAT after reading this book, and then was shocked when the questions on all of my prep tests were SO MUCH HARDER. Not so much with the Logic Games, but definitely when it came to Reading Comprehension and Logical Reasoning. This book doesn't even have very good strategies for tackling any of the sections it explains; it just sort of tells you what the sections are. If you want comprehensive strategies on how to attack the sections, I would look to PowerScore.All in all, this book doesn't use real questions from previous LSATs, and anything that doesn't do that isn't an effective prep book. Don't buy it, it's a waste of money and time."
2,No less a Dummy when it comes to Logic Games,"The hard part in the LSATs for many, including me, is the Analytical Reasoning / Logic Games. I hoped this book would help with that - it helped me not one iota."
5,Pretty simple reading,I find this book so easy to read and the instructions were easy to follow. This is book is the best LSAT book I have ever read. Even better than the princeton review. The tips and resources in the book is more than you can bargain for.Max
2,Can't Believe the Number of Typos/Errors!,"I picked this book up at the book store without the benefit of these reviews--my mistake! There are too many typos/errors in the book. I'm taking the LSAT in December, so I've discarded this one for Powerscore's Logic Games Bible. I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,Too many typos,"This book is wrought with typos. It makes me wonder: If there are so many problems I can already see, how many are there that I can't see (e.g. Questions unlike those you will see on the real LSAT, flawed reasoning, incomplete information, etc). Stay away..."
2,Don't Buy This Book,"I do not recommend this book. There are many errors in both the reasoning and answers to problems. You can't seriously study using a flawed textbook such as this. The explanations for Analytical Reasoning were very confusing and too brief. If you need a good LSAT prep book, I recommend the Princeton Review book. This book was very bad. It frustrated more than it helped."
4,Not as good as Dell,"Gateway is sometime slow at loading, gateway doesn't even have were you can be on the internet and somebody can talk on the phone at the same time, I had to buy a AOL disk. It doesn't matter what new Gatway computer they make it will never be as good as Dell. It still a good computer with a great color printer and great windows XP."
3,Worthy Effort!,"Johnny Farmer is another of the Mississipi Hills bluesmen discovered and signed by Fat Possum Records. When comparing him to some of the others, R.L. Burnside, CeDell Davis, Junior Kimbrough, Asie Payton, Jessie Mae Hemphill and T-Model Ford, for example, Farmer's performance falls a bit short. That however, does not, in any way, suggest that he is not worth listening to, because he is. Farmer's sound is quite raw armed with nothing more than an old guitar plugged directly into a small Peavy amplifier and a deep well socket on his pinky for a slide. The songs on this disc are all traditional numbers arranged and interpreted by Johnny Farmer. Because Farmer does not fancy himself as a musician, it is unlikely that he will ever be coaxed out of his trailer for a follow-up. As such, we will probably never know what he could do with some original material and some decent equipment. Overall, a decent effort from an impoverished bluesman."
4,Latin and Classical Rhythms,I discovered this CD via an interest in Afro-Cuban and Classical music. I passed it up several times because the title just didn't work for me. Finally I gave it a listen and Wow! It is a great mix of latin and classical influences.
1,major disapointment,"Neither modern nor conga line nor classic, just horrible nonsense. Not at all what it was advertised to be. If you are into bizarre collections of random sounds from the 1940-1950's this might be for you. Just don't expect any wonderful Latin rhythms or any musicality whatsoever."
5,great nails!,"you don't buy these because you're too lazy to go to the hardware store. You buy these because you have to do a trim job that you actually care about, probably with hardwood, and you know that the common hardware store finish nails will bend all over the place (unless you're a true hammer expert... I'm not). these nails are stronger, have sharper tips, thinner heads, and a coating so they drive easier. best nails this hack has ever used!"
4,Good story-captivating,I did enjoy this one about the same of the Mark Wahlberg Apes movie. Story was still captivating-even touching at times. It did tie in well as the prequel as I had hoped.
2,Ok,"I like the old planet of the ape better.Sorry I seem wildness movies with bears, wolves, ect with skills and leadership."
4,Surprisingly good!,"At first I thought oh not again! You know what though, I enjoyed it a lot! Good action packed movie. Recommended."
5,We escaped with them,"Extremely well done. Didn't focus too much on things that I know exist but dread to know such as animal experimentation and general cruelty to animals. Instead you find yourself on the side of and the most ""humane"" characters. Also didn't resort to easy excessive violence to entertain. If you want to escape who and what you are this movie makes you feel what it would be like to keep going and going until you are there."
4,I like it!,"This movie was better than I expected. I don't remember much about the original movie, but this one was realistic enough that I was impressed with the story line and the imagery. My sons and their friend reluctantly watched with me. Once they got seated and the action started they were glued to the screen; couldn't stop talking about it afterwards!"
5,Saw this in the theatre...,This is a must see movie! It's what a movie is supposed to be. Should you pass this movie up? NOOOOOOOOOOO!
2,Didn't like it,It was not like the originals and the story line was different. I would give it away as a present if I could.
2,Planet of Apes,"Not a very good movie. It has an emotional story, but its just not a very good movie. It is not entertaining to me at all."
3,its okay,not really worth seeing but if you do the cgi is really good bad story mediocre acting. had potential but little results \
3,Rise Planet of the Apes,"kids enjoyed this more than my husband or I did. I felt the story line was weak, but graphics fairly good. Once was enough for this movie."
4,Much better than I thought it would be - Recommend,"Not a big fan of all the Planet-Ape movies but thought perhaps special effects alone would make this worth viewing. Well like the movie! Plot is so-so but moves along well and great special effects. Would recommend. No deep meaning, but fun to watch."
2,Does not live up to its early promise,"I have to say at the outset that I prefer my ""Apes"" movies to be more thought-provoking than action-packed. I settled in to watching this one fully expecting it was going to be a really good movie, it started out so well. However, after inhaling the chemical that was supposed to make the apes wake up to being more intelligent and humanlike, the ""jailbreak"" deteriorated into rampaging apes just beating the bloody you-know-what out of every human in sight. It ended with such hackneyed violence, it put me to sleep. If you like that kind of thing, you might like this movie. I don't and did not."
3,Awesome CGI... movie overall was disappointing.,After a few friends recommended this movie to me and seeing how the CGI looked amazing I decided to rent it. I can honestly say Ill have no desire to EVER watch it again. Definitely better than the first movie but still not that great.
2,Good Movie.. Bad Quality?!?,This is one of those movies that gets your mind hooked onto the plot and you can't wait for the next part of the series. I'm not gonna go into details and ruin the movie for you.... I gave the movie a 2/5 for the Poor quality of the rental. I expected more out of amazon and got quality that you can barely call standard definition. The picture was terribly blocky but was watchable as long as the apes didnt move to far away and look like black blobs..
3,ok,"Once again the real action took like one hour to begin, and wassup with the end ? i can understand but in my opinion the action wasn't long enough, but it was what we call some ''good action''. 3 star"
4,Excellent blu-ray ... STOP making DVDs,"I rent yesterday here in Brasil the Blu-ray ""Rise of the planet of the apes""Excellent video and sound. Fantastic EXTRAS with the Blu-ray.We are just another animal specie. The apes are just less inteligent than us. There is NO GOD that created any animal or plant, or that control our lifes. Great movie."
3,Another prequel,"The movie was decent. The things i expected were: more violence, sci fi ideas presented, and more plot or complications. If i wanted to see animals interact, id watch animal planet. The movie was predictable, the franco character was not complicated, and the fight scenes were good, but not good enough. I expected the people to fight back better, or differently."
4,entertaining action,"Science and experiments that altered the species, leaves humanity in harmes way in the future world. Entertaining, and outside the box."
5,Great movie!!!,This movie was great and ended with the introduction of what could be a great sequel. I highly recommend you watch this film!!!
3,And you thought the swine flu was bad,"As with all presentations there are promoters as distracters.The product has a sound story. The story stands alone; or if you will can be a prequel to the ape series. There was very little preaching of ideologies and they stuck to the poor pitiful ape finally can get his revenge theme. Someone joker could not help himself and hand to write in the line ""Get your damn dirty paws off me!""Anyway apes get to be the lab animal of choice for a drug that is supposed to cure Alzheimer. The drug gets out of hand the ape gets out of hand and then there is the evil bureaucratic bully who gets out of hand. No one is really a good guy in this film, not even our newly liberated apes.Now where did I see this film before, oh yeah; take out the ape add a dog and voila ""Watchers"" (1988) Based on a novel by Dean Koontz."
5,Great movie & easy download,"I love owning these movies on Amazon. I feel guilty if I don't leave a review,but everyone's dif. I loved this movie and having it on my pc is so easy.There are times when a good movie is all I want.Got it!"
1,Horrendously bad and predictable (and clearly inspired by the 1987 film PROJECT X)!,"Where do I begin...does anyone remember the deathly dull PROJECT X (1987) starring Matthew Broderick and Helen Hunt? If not, it's available on DVD--watch the Trailer on YouTube (Search for: ""Project X-Trailer #7-1987""). RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is an **extreme** version of PROJECT X with many similar plot points and far more action, violence and mayhem. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is worth watching ONCE--just to see how derivative and devoid of ideas it is... I'd give it ZERO stars, but Amazon.com doesn't allow it...so ONE star it is..."
3,Get your * dirty hands off this franchise,"I just wish that if they wanted to do yet another ape movie, it could at least have SOMETHING to do with the original concept and storyline. This had absolutely nothing to do with that except the name Caesar and that's it. Overly CGI, slow paced and full of cliches. Cliche...nasty idiot teases apes. Apes kill nasty guy. One guy tries to show some kindness...he's saved and stuck back in the cage. Ape can finally go home, refuses. Really...who writes this dribble? Everything that happened is so easily predicted. Some interesting deleted scenes showing the motion capture, but that's about it. I'd rather see the original on Blu-ray as cheesy as the costumes were."
2,I must have missed something,"Although, these type of film is really not my genre I was curious, because I love Dystopian Film and literature, I have seen the cheesy originals with Heston and the newer film from a few years back, which was G_D awful.As far as this film goes? well I love the evolution of the ape and the picture used on the promo poster, other than that? well... unfortunately 100+ minutes of my life I will never get back...."
1,poor dvd,i did not watch it never see what is look like the dvd not show nothing so dont worry thank u i dont have no label to send it back because nothing on it dvd is error
1,"Bad, Bad, Boring and BAD!!!","Amazon took down my past review because somebody didn't like my review and called me a ""TOOL"" (way to show your age). This movie was so bad that the CGI out shined the acting by a long shot. It is a hate-filled movie that really has no redeeming qualities I could find. Go way back and watch the original, now that was a classic and even the sequel was pretty good. Over-hyped, over-rated and under whelmed."
5,taking over the planet,"Excellent movie kept you watching non stop through the movie. Very good plot and very good character development, Great special effects!!!"
4,Like the first one twist the old plot,I liked the original Story line from the original movies this one they tried move the story line back to earth but gave a totally different reasoning for the creation of and method of creation of the smart apes. It is probably best to view this movie as a seperate work and not try to relate to the original movies; if you view it as it's own seperate work as a complete new unrelated story line its much better. All in all a decent movie.
4,Though Provoking and Mesmerizing,"This film is a worthy remake (or pre-make) for us to seriously take into consideration. With cloning, germ warfare and genetic manipulation now being a reality, it begs the question, what if something was to go wrong.The base for the storyline is quite plausible, how far are the scientist willing to go to cure diseases? What is really happening today behind closed doors in the R & D departments of mega pharmaceutical companies?What I find impressive about this film is the ""wow"" factor that it generates each time there is even the most subtle, but yet astounding breakthrough in Caesar's intelligence. He proves himself to be a strategist and a thinker, while allowing everyone only to know the extent of his true intelligence on a need to know basis.It is quite worthy of the viewing and it will leave you with a satisfied, yet a bit disturbed feeling, realizing that sometimes, experiments may go wrong, and what would be the true damage in such a sceanario."
5,Amazing movie!,"The third trailer was amazing! It really hooked me into the movie! To tell you the truth, I don't go to the movie theater very often (about once a month?) but the trailer compelled me to go to the theater and watch the movie the day it came out!After watching the entire movie, I was not disappointed. I want to watch it over and over again....so I'm buying it!"
2,Disappointing,"The original Planet of the Apes was a thoughtful political commentary despite its primitive special effects. The 2001 remake was more action-oriented, but at least entertaining. This remake just feels completely lacking. The acting is lousy. James DiFranco just can't pull off a scientist and his girlfriend fades into the background. While I'm a big fan of Andy Serkis' performance-capture CG work, his portrayal of Caesar the chimp didn't really do much for me - certainly not nearly as emotionally powerful as his Gollum. However, perhaps the biggest disappointment was the special effects themselves. Sometimes the apes looked OK, but more often they looked fake. I was really surprised given all of hype. I actually thought the apes from the 2001 Planet of the Apes looked better."
3,Fair,This is a fair update to the Planet of the Apes series. I prefer the original and the costumed characters outdo the actors.
4,Good follow-up in the new PotA series,"This is a decent movie in the new PotA series. The new series is not following the formula of the old one, so this movie is NOT a remake of the second film in the original series. Nonetheless, it is still a good movie, and helps to explain the events that should eventually transpire in the third film of this series (explained in the very last scene of this film)The storyline was convincing, and Ceasar's rise to power is also handled well. Overall I would say that this movie is definitely worth watching, and I recommend it even if you like the original series."
4,WOW!,Totally different from the original! but better I thought. The special effects were brilliant. Pure escapism. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Lola
3,How it started...,"The storyline tells how the apes rose up to gain control of the planet. The movie was okay, but you can tell that the apes are computer generated. One would think with technology where it is today, the animation would be a little more realistic than in this movie. The acting was average and the plot was basic. It isn't a bad movie just don't expect it to be an Oscar Winner."
4,Entertaining and action packed,"I was excited to check this movie but my wife was less than enthusiastic. After five minutes, she was asking me to turn it up! Amazing visuals, interesting storyline and lots of action made this a fun option for our Friday night at home."
5,Please let there be a third installment!!,"Rented this through Amazon Instant Video and streamed it to my TV through Roku (so convenient!). I enjoyed the first installment, and this one was surprisingly good. Acting and special effects were great. I hope there's a 3rd installment planned."
5,Amazing!,"This movie rocks from start to finish. I am a planet the Apes fan from the begining, and I can honestly say this is the best one. I ordered the movie when it came out on amazon and recieved it within a couple days. Great movie....The video presentation is outstanding....the audio sounds great. There are a bunch of special features that people will love. Go and buy it now!!!!"
4,Held My Interest Throughout,"Here's a movie that kept me enthralled throughout though some of the scenes of animal mistreatment made me uncomfortable; such scenes were all part of establishing a hated villain. And you know what almost always happens to these despicable characters.Acting in this movie is very good, and the effects are top notch. The apes do not look like men in monkey suits but real apes with expressive eyes that convey intelligence, thought, and emotion. As with most movies of this genre one has to suspend disbelief and just sit back and enjoy the show.Be sure to watch the credits because something of interest pops up a minute or so into them."
5,Wish I could give 10 Stars!,"I am a Planet of the Apes fan and have been for many years, but Caesar is my most favorite character of all times! I loved the animation, color, everything. I especially liked the facial expressions of Caesar and his body movements in many scenes (Caesar's body movements told you that he was in control). I don't really watch movies over and over again, but this is one of those movies I will watch again. I really wish I could give this movie 10 stars! GO CAESAR!!"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"Two stars is generous for this film! I didn't really want to see this overhyped prequel, but my friends felt otherwise, and we went. For the first 40 minutes, the movie actually has a plot, is on genre, and was surprisingly good! Unfortunately, it goes way downhill from there. As the apes get smarter, the reality of the film decreases, and gets to the point where it becomes laughable. I loved the first half, but by the end of the film, I couldn't wait for it to end. First time director, Rupert Wyatt, really doesn't know when enough is enough! Some of the scenes just went on and on, and of course, they were the more ridiculous ones. Andy Serkis, who played the main ape, did a nice job with what must have been a difficult role. I give him props for that, but it's a good performance wasted in a ridiculous film, that was much too long, one that eventually becomes a farce of itself. Seriously, ignore the hype and save your money, this film is a waste of time."
3,Planet of the Apes,"This movie was alright, but I don't think it cfan compare to the original with Charleston Heston. They changed this story too much from the original and it just didn't ""Have it"" compared to the original."
3,Rise of the Planet of the Apes.,"I have all the original movies and wished they had renamed and not given the movies the same name...you keep wanting to compare.The Planet of the Apes and ""Rise"" are sort of alike and the costuming and special effects are vastly improved...if you go to movies for costuming and graphics. As with any of the movies spaced 40 years apart...technical movie making are worlds apart...which is also true of live theater vs. movies.So the point is which do you want to really see. acting or technique. Please understand I am not a big Tim Burton fan. I am a fan of Mark Walburg and Helen Bonham Carter...so the plus is...I like the acting of BOTH movies. But like Shakespeare or Jane Austin many fine actors do a great job in remakes of the same stories I have never read the novel (s) didn't even realize they were novels until I was asked to write this review. And they are both really good. I like the old movies, but same story the new version is just as good."
1,Weak...,"This movie was like a worse version of iRobot, with apes in place of robots. Just another excuse to overuse special effects...Shame on you James Franco, shame."
3,"Decent, I was pleased","I thought it would be better, but all around pretty decent movie. I like the issues that it brought up when doing genetic engineering of this kind and how we, as humans, don't think about the ""by products"" of our actions. We as a whole only focus on the goal. Prior to watching the movie I read Michael Crichton's Next. It really goes into some of the issues that arise from this sort of thing and is a very good read. The movie was good, well done....just seemed to be lacking something or maybe it pushed too much into a narrow time frame. I still liked it though and found it to be worth watching."
3,"Adequate, but nothing more","The apes are amazing in close up but never quite escape CGI artificiality in motion. The actors are all good but given little to do except embody basic caricatures, establish plot points , and move from place to place. I enjoyed it for what it was, though, and it does rise a bit above the sum of it's parts. There are several references to the original Apes films; some subtle and well-integrated, others a bit awkward and obvious."
2,Last 20minutes worth watching but the other 1:20,I rented this instand video and the picture quality was great. But the movie was so-so. The writers must have seen the original (how else could they have stold two line) but decided their rise would be very different. Good concept but the movie was just too too long and boaring. The movie didn't grab me till the last 30 minutes. The famous lines were lost in this installment.
3,Not that great of a movie.,The movie overall was OK. It was very slow and uneventful for the majority until the very end. The last 10 minutes was the only good part of the entire movie. I would never spend 24 bucks for the blu ray and digital copy. Totally not worth it. Maybe 10 bucks at best..
2,planet of the Apes,"This movie was not that great Why i say that, 1 the Apes are fake and they are not real Apes, 2 there ant no way that a Ape can move that fast, 3 and you can see that they dont move like apes in real life, but if they did put real apes in this movie that would be much more better movie out there to see. I would not wast my money on this movie.."
3,Rated: Meh...,"I don't write spoilers. This movie didn't do well in the theaters. I see why. It's not bad. It's just not that good, either. It's totally predictable, unenthusiastic, & bland. It was worth the $1.98 rental special I paid, but not more. I would imagine movie theater patrons felt very disappointed as they walked out. The CGI they tried to push as being so great in this movie? It wasn't, either..."
1,Horrible!,"Boring and uninteristing movie. The special effects at the end were good,but again just couldn't get into this at all. I am a Planet of the Apes fan,the original is a masterpiece,this is just couldn't get it. It was also very drawn out."
3,Digital Copy?,Loved the movie in the theaters and far exceeded my expectations but what is stopping me from buying this is that i want the UltraViolet digital copy..... i want it on my tab 10.1!!! like all the rest of my ultraviolet movies.. is that too much to ask for?
5,Best Movie Iv Ever Seen,I wanted to see this in the movies but i passed until it came out on demand. Its by far the best movie iv seen. Franco does a great job in this movie just like he always does. The story of the movie is great. Iv never seen the older apes but this one blew me away.Nothing really else to say but just watch this!
5,Great movie,You can't ask for too much mroe from a movie. James Franco is good as always. The main ape Ceasar is great. They do a good job showing his rise to power. I kinda hope they make a sequel but it would be hard to pull off since this one was so good.
2,bad movie....great special effects...,"The best way to talk about this movie: bad movie, great special effects.....the plot/story was horrible, give me a break...."
4,back to our beginnings,I truly liked this movie. I am please with the movie plot. I happen to like all the old Ape movies.
5,Awesome!,Great addition to the series. Intelligent storyline and direction. Love James Franco and John Lithgow. Hope they make a sequel.
4,Enjoyed the movie very much but the ending was not what I expected.,"Was not expecting much when I watched this movie, but found it very entertaining nevertheless. I would recommend people to see it."
4,Movies!,Outstanding movie. I enjoyed all the action sequences. I saw this one on the silver screen and have added to personal collection.Package was damaged.
5,Incredible film,"This is an incredible film that really makes you think and you actually believe this happen. The ending of the movie and the way humans will face near extinction is a big surprise. Better than all the other Planet of the Apes and I am a fan of the original, but this one is just very very good."
4,Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should...,"What an interesting concept; the intelligent apes and the virus the humans created are the replacements and the end of the human race. Well done, the apes are so realistic-even violent the apes are the heroes and the humans are the baddies."
5,Rise of the Planet of the Apes,I really enjoyed this movie it takes me back to the old Planet of the Apes movies.It kind of works in to how it all started. I hope they will continue the story.Anyone who is an old sci-fi movie buff will enjoy this.
5,Great price,This wa a great deal for the price. I shopped around and could only find a one-disc version for a higher price. Thanks Amazon!
3,"Good apes, bad writing","The screenplay seems like it was manufactured by copying all characters out of a cliche book--greedy corporate executive, cruel/crooked animal handlers, misguided scientist trying to help a dying parent. Sadly that may be the reason the apes are more believable than the human characters. Just because the budget was ""only"" $93M doesn't mean we can't expect a good movie. E.g., Hobo with a Shotgun was made for $3M, and had more believable people/plot in it. I think they spent $50M too much. In sum, if you can get pass the annoying humans characters, it could be a good background/airplane movie."
4,Enjoyable.,"I finally got around to renting this and I must say I was impressed.The acting, pacing, script, score...pretty much everything was incredible.The FX were top notch as I expected they would be.The only area where the film started to lose me was during the final act.I think the filmmakers wanted us to feel sympathy for the primates (the scene where Ceasar was pulling his ""friend"" from the helicopter) is a fine example.Sorry, didn't feel it.Other than a slightly iffy third act I recommend this movie.It was wonderfully acted and touched on a multitude of topics.Right, wrong, moral, ethical.Good movie.Recommended."
5,Great action,This was an action pack great movie that made you side with the apes and feel sorry for them. Also what animals may go through so we can possibly find a cure for our deseases. Would recommend it for others to see. Thought provacative.
4,Great Flick,The movie was in great condition although the cover photo looked as if it might be a fake. All together this movie is one of my favorites and I am satisfied with the product.
3,Time,"It was a nice twist on the series and I enjoyed it. Would love to see it continue, was very interesting."
4,Worth the price of admission,Great continuation to an already great ongoing franchise. The special effect in this film blow many of the earlier films away. This is one of those films that is worth owning. Can't wait to see if this will be another continuing saga.
4,Great Special Effects,Some of the best CGI that I have seen in a long time. Loved the social interaction and role play of the apes in captivity.
5,Excellent film,"Excellent effects. Moral story, not just another sci fi blow up movie.Andy Serkis computer generated performance deserves an Oscar nomination.Best music soundtrack of the year.Not to be missed.Human beings are basically evil and greedy."
3,Don't waste your time!!!,"I don't know why they even label this joke of a film ""Planet Of The Apes"". The acting is horrible along with having no plot at all. No plot and really rushed, which could've been steller or atleast worth the time viewing. Although, the apes do look pretty empressing. Ceasar is put togethor really well, especially with his emotions. I also liked how they showed segments of him getting older. If they would've took time at developing a very well written story with a plot rather than leaving the viewer dissapointed and also bringing better actors into the work. All you need to know is that Apes break out and are loose. That is the story. Very dry and poorly put together. Don't waste yuour time watching all the way through if an adult, but I think that it is a good eye pleaser for children."
5,"Refreshingly Fun, Suprising Awesome, Totally Brilliant!","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of the greatest, most exciting, and action packed sci-fi films of the last 10 years.It's refreshingly original and popcorn-worthy, and its effects are absolutely beautiful, and it has an emotional core that sets it apart from your average action film.Andy Serkis shines as Caesar, a super-smart chimpanzee harboring resentment towards humans, while James Franco charms as the human protagonist Will Rodman. The rest of the cast is sensational, too.The action will have you riveted to your seat, and the climax on Golden Gate Bridge is one of the finest since The Matrix.It's like this movie was tailor-made to my tastes. I can't wait for the sequel!"
1,Dumbest Movie Ever,"This was the dumbest movie I have seen in a long time. A few key dumb points:1) A virus cannot create a genetic mutation that will take effect during an organism's lifetime.2) Intelligence is a result of lots of evolution. You can't just make a brain 'intelligent' by changing a few things. There are adaptations piled on adaptations, a maze of complexity that cannot be just started with a magic gas.3) Language is not something that chimps are physically capable of... even if they did become smart, no chimp is going to speak, it does not have the evolved throat organs.Overall, this movie was so dumb it hurt. Every single part, from the acting to the story. Just dumb."
2,Predictable,"There is some entertainment ""value"" in the movie, but for the most part it is/was very predictable. I wish I could give it a higher rating than two stars, but too often into the second half of the movie I kept saying ""pu-leeze"" when many of the action scenes were taking place. I can see teenage boys liking this genere of movies, but for others you may want to search for something more mentally engaging."
1,Do not buy Blu-ray. Incompatibilities between disks and players,"Do not buy Blu-ray. There are incompatibilities between disks and players.The movie is ok, but the technology behind Blu-ray is unreliable. The movie stopped in the middle asking me to update the player which already had the latest firmware version. I will never buy another blue-ray."
3,My only problem with Rise ...,"... is, unfortunately, a big one in my opinion: I'm disturbed by the film's use of Alzheimer's as a plot device. Since it's a major element of the story in the early going, it throws off my desire to watch the rest of the movie. It simply comes off as exploitative. Imagine, for example, using AIDS as a plot device in a Spider-Man movie or child molestation as a plot device in a Star Wars movie. Kinda bothers me."
1,Fantastic Movie - Unacceptable Online Licensing,Seems to be a trend with online content lately. Your better off buying the DVD don't bother with the downloaded version. It's a real scam considering the DRM'd download and playback system with Amazon Unbox doesn't actually work.
4,Better than the original,This plot makes plausible sense and raises many of the same questions as Jurassic Park. When we mess with genetics we open all sorts of unforeseen consequences. CGI is way more excellent than original plus acting is way better
5,Movie Rocked,Thank you Kindle Fire. I watched this movie on the plane and could zone out for a few hours. It was a really good movie - I was super impressed and really liked the story. .. not overdone.
4,About as good as it could be,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes is on the surface a far fetched fantasy flick, but I have to give credit to the film makers because they have made it as believable as it is possible to make such a ridiculous idea. I like all of the Planet of the Apes movies because they are good fun. This one was a real stab at making a serious version and thanks to the brilliant special effects and a very tight script it never really stretches believability (not while you're watching it anyway). You could pick holes in it all day if you really wanted to, but what's the point?It's a fairly slow paced film but it never gets boring thanks to the great acting and effects. Definitely worth a watch."
4,Good Movie,"My wife's a Planet of the Apes specialist and she absolutely loved this movie. She says it's the best one yet. While I could anticipate the end, she was totally shocked at the final outcome. Overall, we both thought it was a very good movie."
4,Better Than I Expected!,"When I first saw the previews for Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I was pretty skeptical. I figured special effects and whatnot would be pretty good with modern technology, but I wasn't too sure about the story. I decided to wait and rent this first, but in the end, after having watched it, I am glad to say that it really was pretty good. I wouldn't say it was totally epic, but it was pretty enjoyable overall. This is basically the story of how the initial group of apes became smarter and began their rise towards domination. It also goes on to show how mankind would begin descending (because let's face it, a simple pack of apes clearly couldn't take over the world), but there is an element within the movie that inevitably brings that about. I don't want to say too much, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone reading this who hasn't seen it yet. All in all, this movie is totally worth at least a watch, if not a buy. Check it out!"
3,OKAY BUT NOT GREAT,"I read the scrypt of a musucal version of Anne of Green Gables and wanted a CD of it. I asked for one and recieved this. I soon found out that it has nothing to bo with that version. This one is okay. The Anne is a bit old as a young Anne. Marilla has a wonderful operetic voice that is wonderful in her solo ""I Can't Find The Words"". Gilbert is also a good singer but nowhere close to wonderful! The chorus is good and full of life. Now we come to Matthew. He is the downfall of the CD. The solo he has is in the style of a Broadway ballet written for a tener. He is oviesly a country singer and the song is a bit too high for him. The CD in all is pretty good but when it comes to the booklet I was dissipointed. It dosn't have a cast list and is not very big at all. If you read the scene by scene provided you notice they cut funny and important parts in the story. But all in all it is a pretty good CD."
3,"Great Gynastics Film, Poor on Story and acting","So If you are looking for a well acted movie and in depth story you are looking at the wrong film. If you are looking for the best movie about the world of gymnastics....this is the best film I've ever seen to date. Mitch Gaylord did win the gold medal in the 1984 Olympics for gymnastics, that is the main reason the gymnastics scenes are so great, along with the other gymnasts in the film. The soundtrack rocks of 80's tunes that stick to the feel of the film, like Footloose, Top Gun, St Elmo's Fire, Breakfast Club, and the way most of the soundtracks of the 80's stick with the feel of the films they represent. The best part of the film is the gymnastics routines. The worse is the acting and the storyline. But if you were looking for the great gymnastics film Stick It was supposed to be, the see this. It is true eye candy for the gymnastics fan."
2,American Anthem,I rated it low because I thought I was getting a DVD. Otherwise I would rate it as 5 stars because I love the movie.
2,Poor film.,"I wasted two weeks of my life working in this film. When it was filming in Phoenix, Az. Terrible story. Mitch Gaylord was stuck up. Pass on this."
1,".YEAH,'CAUSE ALL GYMNASTS SMOKE MARLBOROS...","I guess that was just the rebel nature in him...C'mon this is one of those flicks that made use of every possible cliche,and relied on a soundtrack to sell it...Eighties teen cinema at it's absolute worst.Do not bother with this unless Andy Taylor's killer music video is still included on current copies,it's the only reason I let this stinker take up any shelf space,and the only reason it's getting a one star rating.Don't say I didn't warn you......."
2,American Anthem OK,"I remember watching this movie when I was much younger, when Mitch Gaylord was basking in his Olympics fame. I looked for this movie in the discounted bin at WalMart for many years, but never found it. Decided to buy from Amazon to see if it is what I remembered. Unfortunatley, I must have been too young, because this movie was a dissapointment. My husband enjoyed Janet Jones though, cute. It was fun to walk down memory lane, but skip this movie."
3,Good movie to see!,Its a movie about Olympic hopefuls using real gymnasts. It gets to the heart of those watching. A behind the scenes look at how important competition can be and the struggles that they have to endure.
3,Eighty Four,I really enjoyed this movie back when I was a kid. The trial competition at the end is the best. Janet Jones getting gold and Mitch Gaylord finally getting redemption after failling before.
5,A Great Movie,I have always loved this movie since i was a child and when i found it @ amazon i bought it straight away. I find Janet Jones Story in the movie much more interesting and it's what i focus on when i watch it. I also Love alot of the songs in this film too. I wish they had of making a second movie but all in all i love this film and i never get bored of it.
4,Classic gymnastics movie,"A little more mature than i remembered especially the cursing, but ok for the pre-teen and up with parental guidance. Can't beat the gymnastics and the determination displayed."
3,Sunpak UV filter 58 mm Coated,"The filter is of high quality;but I was shipped a ""digital"" model & the metal ring is too shallow/thin in depth,so that it does not tightly hold a lens cap. The result was that I returned this model."
1,Think twice before buying this book. See my comments.,"I can't say this book is worthless. It is fine on window manipulating (chap 1 e 2). Chapters 3,4 deal with status bars and banners effects, which are no longer used by modern web sites. Chapter 5 is worth reading if you use cookies to store info on user browser. Chapter 6 on search engines is fine too. Chapter 7 menu systems and frames, the way explained in this book, are no longer used in modern web sites (at least commerce oriented ones). Chapter 8 deals with server side scripting, which limits your target to Netscape servers. This is also old technology when compared do asp and jsp. Final comments: Pros: lot of javascript code, including validating functions, window creation and others. Cons: old book, old technology Look for: David Flanagan's JavaScript Definitive Guide (for concise reference) and JavaScript Bible for code snipplets."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this book expecting to cut and paste some cool scripts into my web pages. It turns out, most of what's covered in this book is obsolete, just plain tacky, or already available free-of-charge on any of the web's many java script resource sites. But if you enjoy dissecting the code behind useless scripts, this books for you!"
1,Save your money!,"The four previous reviewers must be friends of the author -- this book is a sham. It has only 8 chapters, each of which address one fluffy topic such as cookies or banners. Server side programming is almost completely ignored -- they throw in one token chapter at the end that only works on Netscape servers! ActiveX is not even mentioned in the book. Better (and a wider range of) code examples can be had at numerous sites on the web for free. Save your money!"
1,Horrible,The first one was a good movie. I hate to say the sequel was a let down. The subtitles were unreadable...
1,Poor Gustav.,"The now defunct Victoria label had some attractive issues in its catalogue, most notably the kinky but good Anne Lise Berntsen recital of Mussorgsky, Wagner and Sibelius songs. However, Anne Gjevang's recital of lieder composed by Alma Mahler, Gustav Mahler, Zemlinsky and Pfitzner is not one of them. This is the worst lieder recital I have ever heard. Gjevang's voice may once have been beautiful but you would not know it from this recording. Her contralto is wobbly, insecure, constricted and harsh. Gustav Mahler composed some of the most inspired and beautiful classical songs yet she manages to make them sound corny and repulsive. If Gustav had been alive and present when she started the recital he surely would have been dead when she finished with him. I don't know why this recording was ever issued. It is utterly unappealing."
3,Great little ride!,"I saw this film when it came out. I was at a fantasy type fair in San Jose CA. I met the director and I think the babe star was there too. Don't remember if I got her autograph.I liked this film. It delivers as an exploitation, cheap horror film. Gorgeous scantily clad women running for their lives. Horror, guts and gore and girls; what's not to like?There is some original themes. The babe's dead boyfriend appears to her with advice about the life beyond and her bad situation. The bad guy prison warded surprises us by trying to squeeze a dollar out of a novel situation.And instead of growing hairy with time lapse photography, so 1960's, the werewolf pops out of a second skin cocoon! That was something new for me.Watch it!"
1,I didn't like it even on a bit.,This is an awful movie with awful ''special'' effects. I don't know how anyone could like it. I had to skip some parts. That's how bad it was.
3,It's alright,"Eva Derrek.....enough said The relationship between her and Victoria DeMare was great unfortunately it came to a bad and typical ending, which in my opinion ruined the film. They spent all that time building up this ""couple"" to only spoil it in the end.The lesbian scene was pointless and random. If there were to be a scene like that it should have involved the above two girls."
2,Great 60's group from the past,"The mastering of the music on this cd is horrible. Alot of the songs sound scratchy. Not much bass and the treble is very harsh. Do not buy this cd, or you'll be throwing your money away like I did. I would recommend buying ""The Turtles 20 Greatest Hits"", by Rhino records.The Turtles deserve better than this. Don't buy cd's from Shout Factory."
1,A real disappointment!!!!!!,"This looks cute and plush on the computer screen, but it's actually far from that description. It comes attached to a cheesy cardboard backing as if it had come from a dollar store, and the quality is of dollar store standards also. The fabric is thin, the stuffing is scarce and floppy, and the face looks sort of like it came out of a horror movie. It looks like something you'd get as a cheap consolation prize at a carnival game booth after spending 20 bucks trying to win something better. What a piece of crap!!!!!!"
1,Junk. Avoid,Soft metal. poor edge. Used for splitting wood at camp. Edge got beat up pretty quick.Finally the head fell off the tubular handle and now I am shopping for a new one.Maybe an old one. This one is cheap junk. Avoid.
1,Waste of money,"I brought this to take it to our car camping trips. It's small and easy to carry but doesn't do the job.I brought a stack of pre-cut logs and just wanted to cut one into smaller pieces and this axe won't do it. Very small handle and almost blunt edge is a big problem. I would have wasted more money in return shipping, so I'll just throw it away."
3,Goldwell Feel Copper,Hair feels thicker when I use it...I'm not sure it looks more coppery though. I don't know that I would try it again.
3,Visually beautiful but instructions incomplete,"While the book is historically interesting and beautiful to look at, I was frustrated by the lack of instructions on details illustrated in the book, i.e. the neck wraps on the cover."
5,A classic of Latin American literature,If you like Gabriel Garcia Marquez... you will love this collection of stories. They are a must read for lovers of magical realism. These stories are the type you can smell and taste. This is the original stuff before everyone started doing it (Isabel Allende for example) and nobody has done it better or will do it better. Nobel Price winner GGM is the most important writer alive and arguably the most important writer of the 20th century...
5,Complex,"Although The Shadow of Solomon is a complex piece of work it is a wonderful collection of a vast array of theory. The author's dedication and detail is impeccable. Yes, he is a conspiracy theorist, but he goes to great lengths to back up his hypotheses.Much of this book surrounds around Secrets from within Freemasonry. Mr. Gardner traces lengths of the organization as well as beliefs back to Solomon, and Ancient Egypt. It reads like a rich text book with bits of the author's fabulous sarcasm scattered throughout. For those interested in the subject this is a wonderful read."
1,Nice cover,"It is a nice cover, but that's about all I can say that's good I am afraid. I was expecting more, but it's just fact after so called fact and most of these are wrong and based on Gardner's world view. Not very good really and rushed out."
3,Flawed,"I bought this on the back of a youtube vid of Penny On The Track.I read the blurb on Amazon and hoped that the Penny on the Track song did not stick out as the best - Sorry for me it did and I wasted my cash.The songs are cute enough but are not very well crafted, they have the hook but can deliver large amounts of cliche whilst doing so.....I thinks he's great, great voice, 2 great songs on the album but the album does not have enough meat to keep you interested, I will bore of ths quickly, resell it on to someone who might appreciate it more than I do."
5,Kweller is Growing Up...,"First off i liked ""On My Way"" alot. I thought there where alot of stand up tracks, but also some crap. Whereas this album doesnt have the songs that blow your hair back the first time you hear them (except maybe ""Run"") it has songs that reward you listen after listen. I find it to be alot better than ""On My Way"", because it cuts the fat and is filled with alot of gems, i dont know why Ben would release ""Sundress"" as his single there are alot of contenders. Some of my fave tracks are ""run"" ""i gotta move"" ""thirteen"" ""penny on the train tracks"" ""i dont know why"" ""until i die"" ""magic"" and ""this is war"".So basically this album is the sound of Ben Kweller growing up, i am excited to hear what comes from him in the future, this is a really great album!!!"
3,not the same,"Like the reviews prior, I agree with their reactions to ben kwellers new album. Although it would be very difficult to top sha sha and on my way, this album went in a direction totally unexpected. I had gone to his show in the Avalon (hollywood club), on Sept. 22. 06 excited to hear his new album, but was left with mixed emotions (thank goodness he played songs from his sha sha and on my way). Dont get me wrong, I actually like ""thirteen"", it very sweet and in love..and ""magic"" ...but over-all it feels like he's changed his style. Maybe i just miss his old quirkiness, those oh- so hilarious and playful lyrics that you could laugh at and relate to at the same time. I dunno this album feels sudued and very lovey-dubey. but its okay, he has such a great presence and voice. his voice on stage and in the studio sounds the same...such a great artist. its okay ben, maybe your new child will bring back that playfulness in you."
3,I miss On My Way Ben Kweller,"I love Ben Kweller and always have. His second CD though, On My Way, I thought was the pinnacle of Ben, and I think with this new CD he has taken a step backwards. The songs have good melodies, and good hooks, and its not a bad CD by any imagination, however, it just lacks the emotion and strong song writing On My Way offered in every song. This is a good CD, but it is just too over produced and not what I really wanted to hear."
3,"New Kweller was disappointing at first, but it's grown on me","Ben Kweller is my favorite modern singer/songwriter. His last album (""On My Way"") was a classic w/ a great sounding band and producer. It felt like you were right in the room listening to a live band. This new Kweller album lost that feel. To my ears, it is overproduced w/ too much compression and many doubled and tripled guitar parts. Reminds me a lot of Jeff Lynne's production on a Travelling Wilbury's album. It has a lid on it. I love Ben Kweller, but this is just too monolithically Ben. Also, his sensitivity has turned to mush on many of these songs. None of the previous melodic brilliance is evident, keeping the melodies super short and limited in range, ala Tom Petty. Too safe, too careful, too canned, too sappy, too Ben. I'll give it 3 stars only because I'm a fan.*Now that I've played it another 20 times, I love it! Very catchy material, almost bubblegum pop, but in a sincere, good way."
2,Also Disappointed.,"I wont go into how much I love his previous albums, but let me say that I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this cd. What happened to the rock songs? Almost every song on this cd is a balad. Cheesy balads too. The lyrics just arent as clever or meaningful. The songs are bland, and actually seem really generic. Almost like a mainstream pop cd."
5,Love It!,"I've been a Ben Kweller fan since his first album. There are classic songs on the Sha-Sha album that just caught my heart. With Ben's sequel follow-up CD, I was quite disappointed and I knew many of his fans felt the same.However, this NEW CD is absolutely Splendid and well-produced! This is very reminiscent of Ben's classic-style and catchy beats. This is well worth a listening to (for me, this will be about the 100th... at least). Check it out, you will be pleased."
1,Not the right direction,"This book has wonderful pictures and beautiful ways of supporting the joys of different skin tones by relating them to pleasant colored items. However, by constantly reiterating ""I am black..."" it takes all of the value out of the extraordinary descriptions of the beauty of being yourself. The author attempts to bring us back to the days of the ""One Drop Rule"" by ignoring the obvious mixed ancestries of the children and claiming them all as ""Black"", thereby reinforcing the division of white vs. black. I was horrified when this book was sent home with my son from pre-school and you can find a book with a much better way of promoting self love and equality."
5,For my granddaughter,"This is essentially a picture book; but oh what wonderful pictures. The author and photographer, wife and husband, have celebrated the variety of black children by comparing their skin, eyes and hair to positive everyday images---peaches, brown sugar, chocolate, ebony, tiger's eye etc. It is a playful and imaginative way of adressing a serious subject---the self-worth of our children. I purchased this book for a brand new granddaughter---she is a delicious mixture of African, Italian and Irish American. She will grow up being proud of her heritage. BTW, I am the Italian grandmother who grew up with a extremely prejudiced parent-----there is hope"
4,"Unique book on skin hues,eyes,hair","1/1/03 Author Sandra L.Pinkney & photographer Myles C. Pinkney's book ""Shades of Black"" which give much pride to all skin colors/ using their favorite deserts:e.g.:(pale)creamy white frost/vanilla ice cream;milky smooth brown/chocolate bar;midnight blue/licorice stick;golden brown/sugar;velvety orange/peach;coppery brown/pretzel;radiant brassy yellow/popcirn;gingery brown/cookie...2.hair:soft puffs(cotton);stiff ringlets(lamb wool);straight edge(blade of grass);twisted corkscrew/rope;long;short;""all my hair is good""(even tangled and snarled)..3.eyes delicate streaks of amber(tigers-eye);warm luste of green(unakite);brillant flashes of blue(Lapis);shimmering glow of ebony/onyx..the book gives most of the colors of skin hue(red,dark comlexion,light complexion,mahogoney,medium complexion) and hair grade(straight and wiry) and eye color(bright eye/brown eyes) and fits its description voiced by the children ""Unique""."
5,A Beautiful Book Everyone Should Have,"I bought this book for my baby girl, who is a ""radiant brassy yellow."" I only wish it was around when I was young trying to figure out where I fit in. While 3-7 is the given age range, this book is appropriate for any age group. It has a powerful message in very simple terms. Focusing not only on the many shades of Black, but also on our eyes and hair. The photography is pretty enought to make the book great for coffee tables, where even your guests can pick up on the book's special message."
2,Shades of black,was kind of disappointed i really thought there was more test to this book it mostly pictures my kids was not impressed with it
5,I will cherish this book always,"My mother gave this book to me when I was in high school. I got made fun of for not being ""black enough"" for years and this book showed me that being black is being a LOT of things. When my younger cousin was battling similar attitudesl, I passed it on to her - then bought myself another copy. I will cherish this book always."
4,Shades of Black,I am a teacher and I used this book with my students. They loved it! They enjoyed the pictures and they were able to read the book independently (great for beginning readers).
5,Beautiful,I love this book. This is a must for all black children. This book celebrates our many different shades through vibrant pictures of our children doing everyday things in bold colors that complement their complexions. The words are also simple for the beginning reader and descriptive enough for the older reader to realize the pride in their own shade of black.
5,A THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE ALBUM,"CLASSIC BARRY MANILOW. I'M A FAN OF BARRY'S SOFTER PIANO PLAYING BALLADS, LIKE ""AS SURE AS I'M STANDING HERE"" AND ""LAY ME DOWN"". THANK YOU ARISTA FOR FINALLY RE-RELEASING THIS ALBUM ON CD, AND WITH A BONUS TRACK!"
3,Not fully described,"Items came from a library which was not noted in description. It took me awhile to get all the covers, stickers and cleaning to make it presentable as present."
5,Great Fun!,We first read this at the library and after renewing it three times we had to return it. But we missed Stanley in our home. So we bought it. It is fun and silly and my sons love the pictures.
5,John Lennon wasn't against the idea of having countries,"moron.Capitol was out trying to make money, so they rounded up a bunch of songs from their vast vaults, to pull at the heartstrings of the customers. I'm pretty sure John came to love America, considering he chose to live here, and raise his kids here. He may not have agreed with the governement, but doesn't mean that he hated america."
3,Good Music,"Nothing outstanding but its a nice collection of music from various artists. Not necessarily the best or most patrotic songs but solid performances from George Throrgood, Lee Greenwood, John Lennon and others.People shouldn't rate the CD based on a song that was released with the permission of an artist or their representatives either. Save it for an message board or a letter to the prodcuer of the CD, or the folks who control John Lennon's rights. Probably Yoko Ono."
1,Patriotic Lennon?,"Obviously, the ... of this CD doesn't remember Lennon or the views he was expressing in the song, Imagine. I was amazed it was used on the TV tribute and am even more amazed it is on this CD. He was against war of any kind for any reason. He was also against government/country. Listen to the WORDS people!"
1,disrespectful,"john lennon would not have wanted his song on the album. the song itself is against the existence of america or any other country for that matter. it is also against war, including the one this cd is attempting to support. this is disrespectful to john and his memory. it's actually quite funny to think that he was patriotic considering that he was british to begin with. quite frankly, i think the makers of this cd should be ashamed for using lennon's song to support this cause."
2,Disappointing,"These strips were given fabulous reviews elsewhere so I thought I would give them a shot. Unfortunately, I have found that although they mildly shrink pores, their blackhead removal qualities are poor as most of my blackheads remain. Maybe after another use more will disappear, but I was unhappy to see only 2 blackheads on the strip after use.Use at your own risk."
1,Didn't work well for me,"I tried this product based on the many wonderful reviews I had and I was extremely dissappointed. I left it on for a full 15 minutes until it was stiff and felt like paper mache, but nothing came off. Maybe I did something wrong since it was my first time using them in a few years, I'll try them again in 3 days and change my review if they work better. Oh well it was worth a shot."
5,An excellent can opener,This can opener is made to last. Excellent quality! It's simple and leaves a smooth edge on both lid and can.
5,I can pray now!!!!!,"I wasn't performing all the obligitory steps in my prayer, now I can pray, and at least assume allah is accepting my prayers. The book flows and allows the reader to easily understand just what the basics of islam are. I recommend anyone and everyone to read it."
3,Quality of product matches my ability/talent,I am not an excellent guitar player so the quality of the product matches my ability/talent. The quality is good enough for me to occasionally practice and play along with my favorite songs.
1,Terrible quality,"I am not a guitar player but I have a son who is interested in learning to play. I ordered this and when I got it, it would not stay in tune. I had some friends who play a lot look at it and they could not figure it out. I took it to the local guitar shop and the guy took a look and said that the frets were ""all screwed up.""I shipped it back (of course, I had to pay $30 to ship it) but they have been really slow to respond to let me know when I will be receiving a refund.I'd go to your local guitar shop instead of buying one online - lesson learned."
4,Great beginner's book,"I first learned sign language using this book. Excellent book for those beginning to learn sign language. The explanations are simple to understand. The graphics are usually clear, so the student will do the sign correctly.Our church switched to a different text about three years ago because of the lack of vocabulary. Since we use the book for three semesters of teaching, we needed a book that would contain three semester's worth of vocabulary. I think that this book is an excellent book for younger people learning sign lanague.The Campus Church, Pensacola Christian College"
2,disappointed in content,"I did not realize this book would be so Christian-oriented. I cannot use this in my classroom as a public school teacher. Also, many of the practice phrases are quite strange (For example, ""Pretty baby is bad."")"
3,Not quite what I was hoping for...,"There are some great pictures in this catalog, but overall the quality is a little lacking for a $39.95 purchase. There could be a better variety of models in the book -- there are two guys who appear a little too often (one being the cover model whose face you can see). Some of the photography seems a little amateur and often low-contrast. It's OK, but if I had to do it over again, I probably wouldn't buy it. A little disappointing."
4,not your average coffee table book,"After buying some RIPS underwear, I noticed this book, and thought, hey, let's see what this is all about. This books shows a very artistic method of selling their products. You get to see some very abercrombie-esque boys in various settings wearing RIPS...... Some of the pics are done in a very erotic setting (male standing ..... behind a fountain, and such). Some of the images are rather homoerotic with two of the male models holding each other or laying near each other. For a coffee table book, I think it works great. I put it along side such books as Erotic Art, and my Abercrombie catalogs. It is tasteful, no explicit...... images, just very attractive men in interesting scenes with RIPS underwear, and it some cases, no ......."
1,Great cover-lousy book,"I read the reviews, but bought the book anyway, because the cover was so hot! Only buy the book if you love the cover. The blonde cover model is not even hot when you see the rest of the pics. And don't expect more hot models inside, except in their underwear."
3,Good but could be better!,"The format for this book closely resembles that of an underwear catalog, in this case ""Rips"" underwear. The book shows some extremely good-looking men in underwear, and without it, no frontal shots. The photography is well done, and some photos are very homoerotic. We hope to see more from this photographer."
2,Waste of Money for Me.,"I bought this book main for insights of winning lotteries. There was not much info with regrades to lotteries but, I did get a couple of good websites. This book is not that helpful otherwise. Alot of this book you could figure out yourself with very little thought. The only reason for the 2 ranking was for the website that did have some good info."
2,I should have bought a lotto ticket,the book really did not tell you anything you could not find out free by doing a google search - save your money and buy a lotto ticket
3,Z,"How to Win Lotteries,Sweepstakes, and Contests in the 21st Century wasn't quite what I expected, the content was good enough but I think it could stand to be updated. I was looking for a book that focused more on the internet and entering sweeps and contests and this book just didn't have a whole lot pertaining to that. Over all it wasn't bad, just not what I was looking for."
4,a review,this is nice as a general introduction to these ways to generate additional money for one's self in addition to regular income
2,Not much content.,"This book focuses too much on the lottery, and not enough on online sweepstakes. The only section I found a bit useful was the one on taxes."
1,As a winner of many contests I recommend that you stay away!,"I am a lucky person. I have won dozens of trips around the world, gift cards, movie tickets, concert tickets, books, movies, cds etc etc etc...and was looking to get a few new tips. I am SHOCKED at the lack of information. IE to win a lottery he suggests buying a ticket. (ok the joke is old eh?) and then goes on and on about odds...using up pages..just to find that he lets the machine pick the numbers. The local lottery website gives the same stats....The information is old. Several contest newsletters have been out of print for over five years. Save your money from this book and get a subscription to one of the excellent contest newsletters such as Bestweekly or Sweepstakes News."
2,"How to Win Lotteries, Sweepstakes and Contest",I was looking for information that isn't common knowledge or common sense. Everything in this book most of the population currently know. He did not tell me anything that I didn't already knew. Great and catchy Front cover.
2,Oops,"Why I got this: I am doing a research project on court life during the reign of Henry IIPros: the book is really well informed, presented well, and is easy to follow.Cons: I may have missed this in the initial product info, but somehow I missed that this seemed to focus on Germanic court life, instead of British. That was my only disappointment, since this won't help on my research.Overall: If you're looking for an interesting read, this is good. If you're looking for something focusing on British courts, this isn't the material for you."
1,"Highly overpriced, but works...","I have 6 of these. 3 I got from traderjon online, thru ebay, and the other 3 from another ebay seller. They average right @ $10.00 each.For 28.00 and some odd cents, you should be getting 3. Dont get me wrong...they are great and the safety clip on front saves epi's and gibsons from being beheaded...but know what you are buying. RESEARCH first!!!!"
3,Oddly Sized,"The product is alright, aside from being pre-stressed (an odd trend I don't fully understand but wouldn't preclude me from buying the product). However, I do have one complaint: the sizing is odd. I bought a small, which, according to past hat purchases, should be somewhat tight on my head. However, it was a loose fit. Not so loose that I could exchange it for an extra small, unfortunately. So, I'm stuck with a slightly loose hat that looks good - the only thing that has prevented me from returning it."
3,This is an extremely effective product,"I have been using Driveway Medic for quite a few years on both my driveway as well on my metal Bilco doors.The product is more expensive than I would like, but is extremely durable."
1,into the trash it went,I used this in several places; it worked for a short while and then started to lift up causing people to trip over it ; removed it for safety sake and threw it away; like having a piece of carpet that starts to roll up at the edges and goes bad thereafter
1,Asphalt Repair Fabric,"I read the reviews before purchasing this product. Even though, I followed the directions completely. This product did not live up to reviews or expectations. It was a waste of money. Now, I'm off to looking for something better, elsewhere."
5,Score one for the master...,Highly recommended. Well written and well planned. Felt as if I was actually there. We need such temperment today.
3,Evening in the Palace of Reason,"Actually I first purchased the book on the amazon site but from a partner retailer who accepted my order, confimred and canceled it for lack of inventory; meanwhile I missed several days and did not get the book at the time expected; had to leave for a trip without the book...I guess I will not buy from partners, only directly from Amazon.Amazon was helpful: they agreed to sell me their copy of the book at the same price the other retailer had agreed to. Thanks to Amazon for standing on my side even when their partner defaulted.The book itself provides some interesting insights into the intellectual and spiritual context of the times.some intersting pages about the ancestrty of JS Bach."
4,"Very interesting, but slow in parts.","I felt like I wanted this to be a kids' book, with the play-along CD to go with it. I wanted to hear and compare the types of music being discussed, to clearly understand the distinction between fugue and canon, counterpoint and the newfangled 'sensory' music of the Enlightenment! I suppose just my admission that this book made me want to keep learning about music and history means maybe I should have given it five stars?? All in all, a very enjoyable read. It's going to be the book of the month for our community book club as well, so we'll see how it's received there."
2,"Pleasant, But....","I have read most of the material out there from musical studies and analysis to books intended for general reading by the public on the subject of Haydn, Mozart & Christian Bach. The reason being, to try and get an overview on the subject from different perspectives and cross analysis. This book does not offer much new information in that regard on the historical background leading up to the Classical Period, either politically or musically.However....To say that ""most"" of Mozart's music is missing something compared to Bach's (is it 51% or 99% that is involved in this statement) is quite daring. What would have been even more daring is telling us exactly what Mozart was missing in his music. Maybe our learned author will tell us in his next book."
2,in search of a point,"Just finished the book, and I can't help feeling that its lacking a point. The are some good anecdotes, but nothing one wouldn't get from a more focused biography.In discussing canons the writer apologizes for boring the reader over the tedium of an esoteric musical form. Seriously? Anyone interested in Bach enough to read a biography, in this day and time, most likely is already aware of the form of canons, probably likes listening to them, and would be interested looking under the hood.If a writer wants to keep it light for a modern audience, then early 18th century Germany may not be the best place to start. That said, there's not a lot of material left to us about Bach, so a rehashing of the old favorites is still a good time even if it was more appropriately published in a periodical."
3,Good way to get to know Gilbert and Sullivan...,"Really now, there is way too much Gilbert and Sullivan in this. Many other people wrote operettas too! Well, there is a little Lehar. But there needs to be more! I thought a little Candide by Bernstein should have been in there too. But the Gilbert and Sullivan excerpts are nothing to be ashamed of. They are done well. A little too operatic. And I just know some of these overtures will delight you. Average recording. Average playing. There's my two cents."
4,"Clean sound, nice asthetics","I've got our PC providing input to the HK3385 which is in turn driving polk home theater speakers that I hung on the wall. The provision of a sub-out was a big selling point for me (though I'm not using it yet), and tipped the balance over the Onkyo TX-8222. A nice feature of the HK3385 is that it displays volume as db below max rather than a meaningless 1-10 or 1-100 or 1-40 or whatever. The sound is clear and clean and I haven't driven it louder than -18 dB or so. The video switching is useless to me and if the price were closer to the TX-8222 I'd be giving it 5 stars."
3,Great receiver with one flaw...,"The HK3385 is an excellent receiver. The blue light accents and silver finish look incredible with any home decor. The 80 watts per channel are clean and clear. This system produces great highs and mids, but the bass is lacking. I have tried different sized speakers with this receiver, yet the bass was never enough. Even with the bass control turned up, the low-end sounded very anemic. The good thing is that it has 2 subwoofer outputs."
1,BUYERS EBWARE,Item was all scratched up when it arrived... Contacted seller and received no response... Do not trust this seller...
5,Everything you need,"Me: Playing all versions of D&D; since 1982.The book: An all-in-one RPG. The Rules Cyclopedia is a wonderfully designed product. It contains everything you need to run a Mystara campaign. It is interesting to see how much LESS sexist and racist the artwork was back then. Absolutely essential to anyone running an OD&D; game. Even if you're not, the stronghold and weapon mastery rules are the best I've seen."
4,Sweet Stand but cosmetic issues,"The top front wood colored panel was damaged in several places, about the size of my thumb nail and for an 80 lb plus package, this was a bit distressing. It is scratched deep below the color. I would not go through all of the effort to return the stand after unpacking the entire thing ( I might add, it WAS nicely packaged). My feeling is that it was NOT damaged in shipment since it was so well padded in the package. I've tried to contact the seller (American 5 Star), but the email was returned for an unknown reason. I'm careful about my internet purchases but trust Amazon thoroughly so after many weeks of trying to find just the right Stand, I went with this. I caution others to contact the sellers before making a purchase."
4,at first,"the front didn't fit me at all, but i went to try it on again and i was able to close it, but it was snug, i'm sure i can find a way to make it a bit bigger, but the shoe looks amazing on. i recommend it. just not for wide feet."
3,It's really been done before...,"This is a tired album full of music that has all been done before and often-times done better. Don't get me wrong, the grooves are smooth and this makes excellent background party music or filler, but it offers nothing new or exciting. I was hopeful when I heard DJ Koop spinning in Seattle at The Baltic Room recently, but this is nothing like the amazing mixes that he was spinning that night. This music is a blatant rip off of several in the Red Hot series and other compilation dj albums. They are really all begining to sound remarkably similar and all seem to take most of their melodies from the likes of Astrud Gilberto and Yma Sumac. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want an album that sounds just like so many others."
2,Who?,"This song boasts three catchy songs that are very pleasant (including the title track and most notably ""Summer Sun""), one or two more that might hold up as strictly background fare, and the rest is abysmal filler that makes the album a strong argument for file-swapping. I suppose this band is trying to be experimental but for what they are trying to execute, I must highly recommend the solo albums of Towa Tei rather than ""Waltz for Koop""."
5,Step Into A Dream,"I bought this CD on a whim -- and boy, am I glad I did! The DVD video for ""Summer Sun"" is pure bliss. For the duration of the song, you feel as if you're on the best vacation of your life -- sunshine, smiles, happiness, and you're deeply in love. It's amazing how pure and beautiful and jazzy the song is, and the mountains and beaches and geometric shapes that that dance across the screen are mesmerizing. Everyone I've shown it to sits for a couple of seconds after it ends, and then says, ""I need to see that again."" I'm going to keep this DVD on hand for emergency attitude adjustments. (The other video for Glomd is beautiful and haunting in an entirely different way.)"
4,"Perfect for bright nights and summer sun, baby!","This is light, breezy lounge jazz, perfect for cocktail hour by the pool. As dozens of your close-knit circle of VIP friends roll up for their sundowners, they will be pleasantly intrigued but charmed by these sounds. Time to dig out the cruisewear and head for the islands"
4,Decided to chill? Do it with CLASS !!!,"This is not your everyday jazz CD. Nope.This is not your everyday downtempo/lounge CD. No way !This is your special ocassion CD !!! This is a journey that begins with beautiful Jazz (including latin-jazz) touched by smooth electronics. It then takes a soft turn into folky-bluessy-housy music (hard to tell), to finally end with some great downtempo tracks. I should mention that all of this happens while you enjoy silky beautiful vocals and groovy bass lines. This is really good music. NU-JAZZ at its best (and at its sexiest too).Groovy, classy, sexy... Just right."
5,WALTZ FOR KOOP IS PURE ENJOYMENT.,"I heard about Koop from a friend of mine in LA. Once I heard this CD I totally fell in love with the music, vocals and stylings of all the artists that are presented on this CD....I play this CD all the time, and sometimes all day non-stop, and I never get tired of it.Koop is smokey, sexy, sultry and very high-end music that needs to be brought back to the forefront of the music world.This CD is completely thorough from beginning to end without one dud. A complete jewel.Only one problem...too little music time. We need more songs!I guess when you have a CD where you keep wanting more is a good thing. A total recommendation to the jazz, sultry enthusiast."
5,A Great Story!,"Leaves of Red and Gold is a great story of love, the law, suspense, and politics! I found the main character to be someone I wish I could have known in real life...bright, handsome, enthusiastic, and caring. I picked up this book on a Friday and read all weekend until I was done..I could not put it down!"
2,amatuerish,"Having recently read many novels featuring a gay protagonist, this book rates at the bottom of my list. (...) I was surprised to find how insipid this writing was, not to mention that there had obviously been no proofreading before it went to press. Every page contains glaring errors (""your"" instead of ""you're"", repeated words, etc.) Truly annoying! The plot held some interest, but the way it was written was totally unsatisfactory in my estimation. Compare this book to ""The Year of Ice"" by Brain Malloy or ""Edinburgh"" by Alexander Chee or ""At Swim, Two Boys"" by Jamie O'Neill or ""The Man Who Fell In Love With The Moon"" by Tom Spanbauer -- all of which absorb the reader with style and substance."
5,Curling Up On the Beach and Enjoying!,As I sit on wonderful Cancun beach I am completely entrenched in Leaves of Red and Gold! It is a great beach book...go out and get it and bring it on vacation!
1,"If it isn't broke, don't fix it.","If you like campfire music, then you'll love this CD. Personally, the music on this CD should have been left in it's orignal state, as in the original version it was recorded in. The one original song that is on this collection leaves alot to be desired. Kip Winger is a very talented songwriter/musician, but after listening to this I think he's been taken over by an ""alien being"" that is impersonating him. He received a lot of flack about the final ""Winger"" project, ""Pull"". But after listen to them both, ""Pull"" is (10) times better than ""Down Incognito"" will ever hope to be."
1,Know what you are reading,"I started reading this book and I liked the style, but as early as the second chapter I realized that not everything in it is faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church.The second chapter of this book is titled: ""Jesus discerning and discerned"", and in contrast to some of what is said in this chapter, I invite you to read the Catechism of the Catholic Church, particularly CCC 473 and CCC 474 where you can find the true teaching about Jesus's human knowledge.Because what I am most looking for in a Catholic book is faithfulness to the teachings of the Magisterium of the Church, I could not finish reading this particular book."
3,Inventing Tom Thomson,"This 234-page book gathers its material from the few biographies and semi-fictional novels about the life and death of one of Canada's greatest artists, Tom Thomson, who drowned in Ontario's Algonquin Park in 1917. She makes no great effort to sort out fact from fiction but rather uses what she finds to argue that Thomson's story is inextricable from the how the nation came to embrace woodsman-artist Thomson, as brother, colleague and discoverer of the nation's spirit."
5,gorgeous and well-crafted.,"I received this book as a gift for my 20th birthday. I am very pleased with it. I recomend it, and especially for its beautifully crafted and translated material. Enjoy! There are so many so many tales... I love it!"
1,Do NOT purchase this version!,"Unfortunately, I bought this version of Rural Hours in haste, and have repented at leisure. Susan Fenimore Cooper's writing is delightful and fascinating to read; the work itself is well worth your time. However, the print-on-demand technology is far from perfect; my pages are full of typos (including the title--it reads ""Bubal Houbs""). Deciphering what Cooper might actually have written is sometimes very difficult due to all of these errors. Mostly, though, it's highly annoying when a perfectly fabulous edited edition is available.So, to all who wish to read Rural Hours (as you well should), be SURE you purchase the excellent edited edition put out by Rochelle Johnson and Daniel Patterson. For some reason it doesn't come up automatically when you search in Amazon, and you have to know exactly that you're looking for. It's worth the search, though--and Susan Fenimore Cooper's work is well worth the read."
5,Great Guitar!,"I've already got the Fender single-coil pickup sound covered with a couple Strats and a Tele, as well as various humbuckers and a P-90. I wanted something for recording with a different sound that you don't hear every day. This is perfect. I play mostly through a '76 Fender Twin Reverb and/or '73 MusicMan 212, with the bass/treb/mid all at 10. Set that way I get the perfect John Lennon sound, (""I've got a Feeling"", ""Get Back"", ""Don't Let Me Down""). I know John played a Casino, but I get closer to his sound using the Joe Pass on the bridge pickup, than I do using my Casino. Very cool. ....and the neck pickup is great for fat clean rhythm work. Sheer magic through a chorus pedal. Wow."
5,Surprisingly erotic!,"Those familiar with the artwork of ""The Spirit"" already know that he possesses a knack for drawing beautiful, sexy women. But what you might not know is that he also has an erotic flair for drawing women delivering sensual spankings to other women's gorgeous behinds! The sub/dom element of the relationships between the women giving and the women getting the spankings is quite enjoyable to behold in the Spirit's work. I would really love to see more!"
3,Do not buy until you have read the APA ethics code online for free,"I'm not going to say that this book is a waste of time. If you are taking an ethics course and want something in writing to cite from, this is certainly a good book for that. My advice is: Do not buy until you have read the APA ethics code online for free. The APA puts its ethics code online for free, just type in 'APA ethics' into google. You will get a much better and concise description for 100% free. This book is not a manual, but rather, as a commentary of a guide of APA ethics. I gave it three stars because it is not neccessary to function as a Clinician - it is more like an supplemental guide for learning ethics."
1,Is he imitating Arrau?,Plays like a student. The quality of this recording is POOR. He seems to be trying to imitate Arrau (!) He also plays the wrong notes!!! (reading?)
2,Gold Diggers?,"I bought this for my girlfriend because she finds the show entertaining. I tried to watch it with her but I can't stand it. Bridgette is cool, Kendra is massively annoying and Holly is possibly one of the fakest people on the planet.This will appeal to females only and if you are a male and get stuck watching it with your girl one day, well hopefully its the episode where you get to see Bridgette mostly nude popping out of a birthday cake. Otherwise theres not much this show can offer you."
4,THe GiRLS NeXT DooR SeaSoN 3,"The girls are back and better than ever. The season kicks off with a snowy Christmas at the Mansion and ends with the Playmate of the Year luncheon. This season also includes: The Renaissance Faire, snowboarding in Vail with Shaun White, Valentines and Mardi Gras celebrations, a calender photo shoot, and race car driving. It also includes Bedtime Stories: The Best of The Girls Next Door which is very funny and entertaining."
3,Love the show but...,I loved this show when it was aired on the E network and I expected this DVD would be just like the episodes they aired on TV BUT they were all uncensored which I am NOT happy about. I always have to cover my eyes when certain scenes come up which is kinda anoying! I love this show so much BUT I do think there should be a option to blur nudity or to watch uncensored but beside that lovely box set just hate the uncensored nudity!
5,perfect chemistry,"I haven't seen the DVD either but I saw all the shows. (thanks to my DVR)These three are just fun. The steady reliable Holly, Hef's no.1. The emotional sweet Bridgette and the ghetto not too bright Kendra with a body to die for. Of course there is Hugh Hefner. He reminds me of Tom Bombadil in the Lord of the Rings. Happy go lucky and nothing negative sticks to those silk pajamas he wears all day"
5,A Must See,Girls Next Door r addictive to watch.people r crazy not to buy all the seasons. can't wait for season 4 and 5 to come out!
3,Ok,To much work involved with it. Supposed to go on website an connect with them. Good luck. And a lot of he's playing is not tabbed.
4,Beautiful illustrations,"The first thing that drew me to this nonfiction book was the gorgeous illustrations by Cowcher. They are beautiful. Her use of ""cool"" colors such as blue, purple, green, and gray add to the wonder of this book. If you are a teacher, this would make a great addition to your personal library to use with units on penguins or Antarctica. It also comes in a ""big book"" format and is worth the money!"
4,Dreamy !,"Sometimes I get so ""into"" the beautiful harps, I forget it's Bach!Good for massage appointments, rainy days,lazy days outside in the hammock, or pretty much any time!Enjoy it very much."
3,***,"I've never read a first-person account of a war experience, but Mr. Kovic's book was very gripping and haunting. Most of it seems to focus on his experience after the war and what he went through in V.A. hospitals. His desriptions are shocking and tragic. He mentions in a foreward in a new edition of his book that he feels his chapter about his childhood is beautiful, and I agree. He portrays an idyllic upbringing that was quite beautifully recounted."
3,Exception Vietnam Account,"Ron Kovic's account of his life before and after the Vietnam War is moving and disturbing. Kovic relates to his audience exactly how he was the All-American Boy before the war, and how drastically he changed, not only because of his handicap, afterwards. No survey of the Vietnam War era or the Anti-War Movement would be complete without Kovic's account."
4,sad time in our history,"When I started reading, I was not sure I would finish or keep reading, but as I read on, the story was really good, and I felt bad about the wars that take away lives. World peace seems a long time in coming."
3,Ron Kovic is a hero.,"Ron Kovic has done many things for this country and has suffered alot. Not only during his tour of Vietnam but also and even more importantly afterwards.This book explores Ron's feelings, and most honest thoughts and deeds.However, I did not really enjoy reading it. I was very interested in his story and regard Ron Kovic as a hero. I think he is a good man who has fought hard to accomplish many things. You can't help but feel as if you know part of him through reading this book. This isn't just a book, it is someones LIFE.That being said, the book was dry in many parts, hard to comprehend when he went from first person to third person (Yes, I understand the psychology behind it) and overall dry, dry, dry. I enjoyed seeing what really happened in his life, rather then the movie. However, I think you can watch the movie and in some ways get just as much of the feeling if you keep in mind it is real."
4,"The Brave, The Loyal, The American Kid","""Born on the Fourth of July"" is a fantastic novel about the tragedy and revival of Ron Kovic. He wanted to be John Wayne fighting the Vietnam War. He wanted to be an American hero. He truly turned out to be one. But, no thanks to the United States. Great Reading. You'll learn plenty about America and even about yourself."
5,best book ever,"""Born on the Fourth of July"" is one of the best books I have ever read. The book is a true story about Ron Kovic, (who is also the author) a marine in combat in Vietnam who gets shot and is paralyzed from the waist down. The book takes you on a journey through his whole life from his birth to his turn around from marine to someone speaking out against the war. The book is a very emotional book especially for a guy. The book is not for all ages but for a more mature audience. The book helped me realize that war is not the answer to a problem. I highly recommend this book for any mature youth who would like an in depth look at what war will do to someone."
5,This book was so good,"""Born on the Fourth of July,"" was a book which brought tears to my eyes immediately. It's a very appropriate book to read at a time of war in our country; it gave me a better understanding to what these poor soldiers are facing every day. Ron Kovic told a story of courage, bravery, and sacrifice. Not only did he discuss his own personal experience of the Vietnam War and the effect it had on him, but he deeply described all aspects of the war, from boot camp, to the people he met, to what the actual battles were like. However, it is mainly a story about one mans loss, and how he learns to cope with it every day for his whole life. It deeply affected me because I know there our soldiers out there today going through the same type of experience. It will touch your life as well and allow you to think about it too."
4,Surprisingly good.,Had to read it for a class and it was surprisingly good. Very interesting reading about the Vietnam War and the injured survivors from the perspective of someone who lived through it rather than just a textbook.Relatively easy read if you're not into long/difficult readings.
4,The Movie Was Better,"It's a great story; raised with a sincere sense of patriotism, dreams of being a national hero, enlists in the Marines, and comes back to a country that doesn't want him. The troops that returned from Vietnam hardly got the welcome that their fathers got after WWII. It was as though the country wasn't happy that they'd survived (kind of like the way Francis Gary Powers got treated when he returned to the USA.)My problem is the writing. I feel like I'm watching Kovic's story by peeking over the fence, and there's not enough of his voice in the book. The movie rewrote everything to include more dialogue between him and his old friends, his parents, the other veterans. When I finished the book, I felt a bit disappointed in that it didn't include enough of his own words.Perhaps the recent edition has updates? The copy I read was very old, so I don't know if the new one has anything added."
5,Born on the 4th of July,"This is a stirring, powerful book. It describes one mans idealistic dreams of America that become shattered when he goes to fight in Vietnam, becomes injured and is cast aside and treated poorly on his return. It is an account of his recovery and his new found resolve to fight back against the system that betrayed him. This is such a powerful read it is hard to give it full justice in a review, this is easily one of the best books about war that has ever been written. The author uses excellent literary techniques to make you feel his anger and frustration and this book is immensely easy to read, you will find yourself flying through it. Highly, highly recommended.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Sad true story,"The story is poignant of this good American youth who went enlisted in the marines to fight in Vietnam in order to coma back as an Hero. Who did not have such glorious dreams ?Alas, he was seriously injured, and returned in a wheelchair deeply traumatized. Injury was double, physical and psychological, as a former Vietnam vet and thus rejected by society.Every holiday, patriotic, July 4, this dual wound bleeds more because this man is born on the Fourth of July (hence the title). How such a man can escape his tornament is well described in this very good book."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT...TOTAL WAIST OF MONEY!!!,PLEASE DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE SPLASHY REVIEW! I bought one expecting it to deliver what it promised: a professional pants press that saved me trips to the cleaners. NOT EVEN CLOSE!!! It could NOT even get the most simple wrinkles out. I even turned it on for two consecutive hours of pressing and nothing!IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE NUMBERS I WOULD!IT WAS A TOTAL WAIST OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,ripped off,"I bought what I thought was a steam press...I have a regular trouser press already.When it arrived it was v difficult to get out of the box and the box was destroyed.I found I had been ripped off.The press was a regulat press from a different manufactueer and had no steam option.I was too pissed off to have it returned , and threw my old r[press away...NEVER AGAIN AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,always have wrinkles,"no matter how hard we try, we always have new wrinkles after the pressing cycle is over!!!! maybe it is just us, but we cannot get the suit pants in it straight enough so it comes out completely pressed!!!! There are always a couple of new wrinkles in there...."
5,After 4 years and still working like new,"I bought these presser 4 years ago, and it works very good. Easy to load pants on, and then move the dial to set the pressing time and that's it."
4,"Great product, if only.....","This is a great product and we used it several times over the summer. We would have been able to use it sooner HAD IT COME WITH POLES! Nowhere on the packaging or info on Amazon did it say it didn't come with poles. We got the net and were so excited to use it, but then found it didn't have any poles. The picture on the box had poles.... but nope, we had to order those separately. That is a bit misleading and that is why I am giving the product 4 stars."
1,Don't use this product!!,"I just tried this product and had a severe reaction. My face is bright red and has a burning sensation. The company does have a medical hot line which is a good idea. This is the first time I've ever had a problem with any product. My advice to you is not to use it and my advice to Biore is to pull it off the market, PLEASE!"
4,Don't Judge What You Don't Know,"I liked this book, and though it is fiction it gives an arab womens perspective on life in the middle east. The author uses her own stlye of writing and reminds me of Azar Nifisi's book Reading Lolita In Tehran. I think to appreciate this book you need to know a little something about mid eastern culture, instead of just saying it gives stereotypes we use today towards arabs like one reviewer wrote."
2,Went Nowhere...,"I thought this book was going to give me insight into a Middle Eastern culture I knew nothing about, but instead it was a bunch of essentially short stories that seemed to go nowhere. I barely made it through this book and learned very little. I'm not sure why this book is/was considered cutting edge or juicy. Trust me, there's nothing juicy in this book."
4,Holds without sticking too much,This tape is very good compared to other brands. I use it to tape my thumbs 6 times a week. It provides a good grip without peeling off your skin when you unwrap it. It it doesnt have those threats hanging on the edges.
3,La Razon de la Culpa,"First of all, the cover of this movie is from another movie and I was very disappointed that his real voice was not used in the movie except when he sang. I admired Pedro Infante for the hard work and artistic dedication he put to perfect his craft and his singing was and still is very poetic. Other than that, I will continue to purchase his movies from Amazon. Thanks."
3,Broken Disc Case,"I choose this seller because it mentioned it it .90% new. When I received it I found the case was broken and cannot be used agan. I have no idea if it is caused by mail delivery. Lucky the disc and the song book are ok.The delivery time is about one week less than expected, which is good."
2,Bad shipment.,"This is the second time I have ordered these La Tempesta Grande Biscotti, and this is the second time they were delivered with practally all the biscotti's broken and in pieces. These were shipped very poorly inside a large box with very little wrapping protection making the 2 units I purchased bounce around thereby causing the breakage. The biscotti's themselves are very tasty if you don't mind eating them in pieces. I blame Amazon warehouse for the poor packing and they should take more care when they ship items that are subject to breaking if not wrapped properly.If they came whole and not broken, I would have given these biscotti's 5 stars."
3,Biscotti,"While the product has great taste, they arrived all broken in pieces. That sort of spoils the whole thing."
1,What A quality,"THE AMAZING LIVE PERFORMANCE AT CAMPFIRE,NEW YORK HELD ON JANUARY 2005 BY EXTRA-TERRIFIC DUO THOMAS & ERIC AND THE UNIQUE SELECTION OF TRACKS BY UNDERGROUNDS AND DISCO/HOUSE PIONEERS (SUCH AS HOT CHOCOLATE,DOUBLE FANTASY AND HARARI)Yes, I was there and I danced all night AND NO OBJECT COULD ever STOPPED ME...As soon as this terrible thing was released...FOR AN UNORDINARY PRICE...I thanked god that I WILL own something that has my breath and sweat on it (Since I WAS A WITNESS OF THAT NIGHT)But sadly all I CAN SAY THAT BLINDNESS MADE ME BOUGHT THIS TERRIFIC CD IN CONTENT..AND BAD IN QUALITY....VERY BAD!I mean,All tracks were distortioned and had a lack of quality..plus some interupptions of microphone snores and noise....not even a single clear track...you even can't judge the mixingI really should read what was written on the cover with a very proudfull way: All skips,feedback and distortion are just part of the night so make it nice!Nice for what?"
5,full assurance,This is a wonderful book. Especially helpful to those who want assurance of their salvation. It has an easy to understand question and answer section that just may answer questions that you may have.
4,Great Folder,"I had recieved this knife close to last year and it came razor sharp out of the box and at a good price, this knife will serve you for years if you treat it well and maintain it. The only gripe i have about this knife is the springs used in the axis-lock mechanism seem to be very fragile (i broke both of them) and seem to break fairly easily."
2,Wanted to love this knife,"first off i love benchmade, i think they make a top quality product.I wanted to love this knife so much. I love how light it is, i love the blade shape and steel. I like the size....BUT... I HATE THE GRIP MATERIAL. I tried to keep this knife, but i couldnt. I hate the grip material, i like handling this knife. It is unbearable to me. I have never had an experience like this. I cant stand the grip. it could be just me, because i know many others love everything about this knife.just thought this review mite help someone else. to those who like the feel of the grip, congrats you got an amazing knife!"
1,very bad,"i did receive the wrong item and still waiting for the aproval to returned, i buy it the last month"
4,An enjoyable book,"A truly outstanding feature of the stories in this book is the dialogue. From the coal region originally, I got homesick for the talk on front porches, at block parties, and around the bar ""upda Legion."" Besides the genuine coaltown dialogue, the book also captures the ambivalence of people like me who had to move on from the region to go where the work was. The story ""Black Dirt"" is the best example of these mixed feelings."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews here I went out and bought this book. I was really hoping for a good read, but I tend to agree with reader from Wilkes Barre, below. The author shows promise and imagination but doesn't seem quite ready for the big leagues and needs a better editor."
2,HUNTER/KILLER A BUST,"As a huge fan of Patrick Robinson, I was greatly disappointed by his latest, ""Hunter/Killer"". It spent half the book setting up the ""bad guys"" mission (which is what I expected), but when it came to the rebuttal from the US of A, it was as if Robinson decided that to do it right would make for too long a book, so he hurried through it. What happened to the French President? Did the ships docked along the French Riveria ever get blown up?Did King Nasir go after the French Special Services for trying to assasinate his buddy? General Rashood played second to a new character - so I suppose the saga of him and Shakira is still to follow. Operation Tanker was a total ""shoot and run"" . There is normally more action taken by Morgan and the USA. To blow up France's tankers and escort was a good starting point, but come on, Patrick, you can finished much, much better than this!!!!"
2,Decent story marred by errors,"After having thoroughly enjoyed Nimitz Class several years ago I anticipated enjoying this novel. The story line is decent, but the book is marred by myriad technical errors; a Browning Hi-Power revolver, AK47 bullets (7.62x39mm) that won't penetrate a wooden table top, supposedly highly trained Mossad assasins who walk into a crowded restaurant and attempt an execution by wildly spraying the entire restaurant with AK's, etc., etc. Overall, a disappointing novel. Save your money."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another of Patrick Robinson's submarine technothrillers. Not as much submarine action in this one, as a fundamentalist Saudi prince and the French government join forces to blow up the Saudi oil supply and cause a revolution. Crusty old Admiral Morgan, retired, is still calling the shots, with his aussie offsider. A French Special Forces major is at the heart of the action, pursued by everyone. This is basically all plot, reading like a description of a military mission, for large parts."
2,right wing fantasy,"Like Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum, these authors seems to lose steam after a while. I suppose it's hard to keep pulling a rabbit out of your hat all the time, but Patrick Robinson is definitely on the downward slide of his talent slope.Since HMS Unseen, which was great, Robinson has gone to heavy-handed attempts to forcefeed us right wing propaganda and his stories suffer for it. The Democrats are portrayed as weak, stupid, and the source of all the world's problems and with no redeeming qualities. If he spent less time on politics and more time on character development, this could have been a better product. Instead the effort comes off forced and clumsy.If you worship the holy trinity of Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Rush Limbaugh, this is the book for you. If you like thrillers with a little more subtlety and believability, spend your money on Nelson DeMille or Brian Haig."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Robinson knows a little about subs; his knowldge stops there! He completely misunderstands the culture of Saudi Arabia; knows nothing about the economics of petroleum; and is clueless about the operations of international diplomacy. His central premise, that the economy of Saudi Arabia could be seriously harmed by disruption of the flow of oil does not take into consideration Saudi dollar, sterling and Euro reserves; the rolls that would be played by banks and oil companies in recovery from any problem and the unity of the Saudi psyche.This is a stupid and worthless book best avoided!"
1,boring,"The book seems written on auto-pilot. Lots of uninteresting details on characters` background. Not really exciting, as the author`s first books. The question is not to fill most pages just with words but to fill them with an good story."
1,Hunter Killer,do not know anything about this book did not order and have not seen it.. If you want an honest survey make sure I bought it so I will know whether I read it or not
1,Full of political drivel,"I am so sick of the political undercurrents in Patrick Robinson's books that I have stopped reading them. Though the stories are good, Robinson diminishes them by labeling and pigeonholing and demeaning anybody he does not agree with politically - especially Democrats. I stopped reading Scimiter SL-2 because I got so sick of it. I'm sure HarperCollins would sell more books if they could get him to stop the bashing."
3,Unlocking!,This book is very hard to follow with small print however the message is great and it's interesting to find out what secrets from our past hold us back now and that just revealing them helps us move forward.
2,Recorded in a pillow case?,"An academic and lack lustre reading futher marred by dull, muffled sound quality. Superior versions are available on Sony Records by Riccardo Muti. Also check out the 'Symphonic Fellini/Rota' on the Silva label."
2,Kool & the Gang!,"DVD was okay, specially live at NYC Club, & listening to the Gang talk about their history together. Musically, old school instramentals show the Band's funky, original sound, but there is no JT!"
5,Public Speaking,Just the book I needed for my Comm 1110 class. It is easy to read and understand with pertinent information to help me succeed.
2,ONLY VOL 1!,If you're looking for last names from Abbot - Cuttriss it's a great book... but it is only Volume one of a set!!! Be aware!
4,"Hot, hot, hot!!!!","Can't say anything bad about VH's second album. It hit the spot straight on. ""At The End Of A Slow Dance"" is my favorite - retro 80s vibe. Lyrically interesting to say the least. His cover of ""Mean Sleep"" is hot - Love Nikka Costa. Overall I give the album a 4.5. Although ""Ride, Ride, Ride"" is very Lenny K. I didn't let it annoy me;it's easy to overlook. Can't wait to see him at the Canal Room!!!"
3,"Good, But Not As Strong As His Debut!!","When this CD came out, I ran and bought it becauseI loved his debut ""Van Hunt"" so much!...But as I listened, I found that there were songsthat I liked that were tight and funky, while others,which sounded more like demos, left me cold!But I still think that Van Hunt is one of thehottest new talents out there today...(a genuine talent!)and if only he could get some good promotion andif urban radio would open it's long constipatedminds and tired playlists and let him, Rashaan Patterson,Jon B., Anthony Hamilton & Me'shell N'Degeocello inand upon an urban music public which is starvingfor creativity and originality to come back fromthe dead...then the world will get to give brilliantyoung kats like this a chance to shine, develop andin the process, awaken a long dead R&B; / Urbancontemporary music scene to come forth!HIP-HOP IS DEAD!!....PUT THE FUNK & THE LOVE BACK IN IT!!"
2,Just Ok,"Van Hunt is a good musician,but doesn't have any real pressence as a Vocalist to me on a whole. hit&Miss Songwriter. production is very Polished as are most of the arrangements.again you can hear his many influences,but you never find out quite who the real Van Hunt is.basically while a cat who is talented,he is basically another cat who sounds like alot of people,but never finds himself.He is burried way into his influences."
2,I should've purchased the second cd first,"I've heard a lot about Van Hunt over the years, so I figured I'd FINALLY buy his CD. I purchased the first album expecting a major ""wow"" factor. It did not happen for me. I think his second CD is much better than the first."
3,Diverse dance,"3 1/2The rare neo-soul output that stands alone, but this heavily constructed affair struggles to find many of the carefree grooves that dominated the debut."
5,VAN HUNT does what he does..... MAKE GOOD MUSIC,"Sophomore album is phenomenal, when I first ran through the CD, I thought I was going to be disappointed because it was clearly different from the first CD. When I got a chance to listen to the entire CD, I love every bit of it. It's not the same music as the first CD and it shouldn't be. Anyone who listen to this CD and felt any disappointment, listen to it again, matter of fact, listen to this CD when you have some quiet time and can truly enjoy the lyrics and the music, then come back on this site and update your review, I guarantee you , your opinion will change. I truly hope Van Hunt continues with his style of music, he refuses to be locked into a genre ,I hear jazz, blues, rock, soul, neo soul, you name it.. it's in his music. You listen to his 1st CD and this one and realize you can't even imagine what was going through his mind when he wrote these songs, they sound like the words and music of a mad man, yet a genius."
4,Soulful,"We definitely need more soulful artists like Van Hunt recognized and listened to more. It's music that's deep and fun at the same time.Most people are living their lives without any substance. This kind of music helps bring substance back into our lives without sacrificing any of your enjoyment.As much as I enjoy this cd, I don't think it's as good as Van Hunt's self-titled first album. That probably has to do with the fact that he aligned himself with American Idol Randy Jackson to help produce this album."
3,What gives?,"As mentioned by a few other reviewers, I was left wondering, ""Huh?"" and scratching my head on this one. I absolutely loved Hunt's debut, but this sophomore album really didn't do it for me as much. Sadly, there's only one track on the entire CD that I really enjoy (#10). Mind you, my somewhat negative review for this CD by no means depreciates Hunt as the excellent artist that he is in any way at all. I can understand trying something a tad bit different and changing up things a little for his sophomore album, but honestly, I think he went a little TOO far out in left field. Either way, I won't give up on him just yet. Instead I'll allow album #3 to make or break my ""fanship"" when/if it drops."
3,It was Aight!!!,I don't know why but I was not really feeling this album too much. I do love mean Sleep....i played it over and over. Priest or Police is pretty good too. I really just bought it to support him!
2,What Happened?,"I give Van two stars for effort and artistry. I was expecting a total heater after his first CD. I am hugely disappointed. Once again, I respect him as an artist and appreciate that he is unconventional in style, but it seems that he's flipped the script. To me, the worst thing you can do is change from the artist you were when you were building a fan base. I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with this work, but it did not go over well with me. Is this a crossover?"
5,"I had to give it up...Van Hunt gets a ""five""","This is the first VanHunt album I've owned. This is a wonderful CD, I like most every song. Even Daredevil, which I used to skip is growing on me. But you have to have an open mind with this one because each song has its own style. Its got a lot of guitar. Its got a couple of 80s sounding songs. It has some pretty good lyrics. But I like it, 80s-sounding-guitar-good-lyrics and all. I always go back to this CD, its been in the trunk ever since I bought it a couple of months ago.Open minded ""alternative r&b; neo soul heads"" this one is for you."
3,"Good overview on the subject, but could be better","Ok, so turning to the for dummies books on a new subject is not a bad approach, and this book does provide a good overview. However, the author make many leaps of logic and did not do a very good job researching is antedotes.One example is when the author talks about Pres. Truman being a product of the Pendergast political machine in St. Louis. Well, it was actually Kansas City. Not the point of the story, but it does show that the author was careless with his facts."
5,Makes the Tenth Century come back to life!,"The title makes the tenth century sound so depressing and dull, but the text makes the tenth century come back to life. Great stories about great figures from the past. The author has a knack for pulling you in and making you want to know what happened next.A great survey of the time period, it gives your that big picture of how different events relate to one another while making them intriguing at the same time. If you have any interest in this time period, or wonder if you should, find a copy of this book!"
5,These old songs sure bring back old times!,"I have to agree with the previous review. I was also two years old when this album first came out, and ""The Old Songs"" has to be the first ever Barry Manilow song I ever heard on the radio at that time. Even as of today I still get goosebumps or all choked up when I hear that song because it's absolutely timeless.This album has lots of touching, yet heartfelt tracks on this album that just move me to tears when I listen to it. You almost need to have a hankie at the end.If breaking up is hard to do for you, I highly recommend this album."
4,The book is quite good as an introduction,"The book being reviewed here was quite succint and accurate (I must admit I haven't read it yet, though). Basically, it can be viewed as an introduction to the field of neurosurgery. It touches some basic medical/clinical stuff which is nice as a review of those topics. The chapters are not so long, which I find I find advantageous, due to sometimes myself being short on time to read. I highly recommend it. One thing that I would have liked to have seen were if there were more full-color pictures. But this would not have deterred me from buying this text anyway. Hope this review was helpful."
3,Neurosurgery for the medical student,"This is the original essential neurosurgery handbook that your junior attendings may have used while in medical school or in residency. It covers all of the basics and gives you a step ahead. The chapters are short and well organized. Nevertheless, a second edition has been published and is recommended over this edition."
5,Great book,"My selection for a Christmas present for myself. We are all studying rocks, minerals, and especially crystals. These are the most beautiful of the best and will pave the way for s visit."
5,Great Coffee Table Book!,"What a beautifully illustrated volume! 137 pages of gems, all in color, with corresponding descriptive text. Many of the gems featured, if not all, are in the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution. The photos are to die for - they are done by the museum's chief senior staff photographer, who spent months perfecting his techniques. You will be fascinated!"
3,incorrect blurb,"Who wrote the blurb for this book? I just finished it (A book on tape read by the author) and the blurb has nothing to do with the book. Sam was still alive at the end and there was nothing to do with a neighboring hunt. Oh well. Not one of the best books Rita Mae Brown has authored, but I learned quite a bit about foxhounds and hunting. After I finish one of her books I want to return to Virginia. I'll keep reading."
2,Ridiculous climax,"I listened to this on CD in my car...driving around western Virginia.-The author is not a very good reader...her rhythm/intonation is off...but I didn't mind the flubs at all. It's nice to have a reader that sounds like a real person. And by having her read it, the we avoid the distraction of having the technical terms being pronounced incorrectly. (Although I'm not used to hearing ""hooves"" rhyming with ""moves"".)-It's a matter of taste, but talking animals (or babies, for that matter) have no appeal whatsoever for me. Ugh! And if they did talk, no horse that I've ever ridden would have said, ""Are you all right?"" when I fell off. I believe they'd say, ""Aaaaaaaaah...at last. Hey, there's some grass!""-Being a woman of a certain age, I liked the Sister character, (although I don't believe she still had her figure at 72). But the denouement---and Sister's actions in it---was utterly improbable and illogical. Gimme a break!"
1,disappointing,We know Rita Mae can write. I remember one Thanksgiving years ago reading parts of one of her books aloud to my sisters and all of laughing so hard we cried. She had captured reality and presenting it wondrously. This book however shows none of that talent. Most of the dialog comes across as extremely stilted and unrealistic.
2,Very poor editing on the audio edition,"This was the first audio version of the author's work I have heard. If this is a sample of the quality of editing I will steer clear of the others. Although I found the author's voice unappealing, even worse was the swallowing sounds she made when reading her novel. The editing was so poorly done that you could hear pages being turned. When she made a mistake in her reading she began the sentence over again and the mistake was not edited out. Either this was a very low budget project or quality control forgot to check this one.I have enjoyed her books in the past but next time I'll check to see who is reading it before I pluck it from the shelf.As noted in the other reviews, the book jacket's description is not actually what happened in the book. Perhaps it was written for another book or another version of this book that never got to the publisher."
4,Another winner for RMB,"What can I say, I love RMB's hunt series. Her recurring characters are just wonderful and I want to be friends with them. This novel is another winner for Rita Mae Brown."
2,What story?,"I enjoy reading Rita Mae Brown, but this one was a let down. Starting with the completely inaccurate description of the book (I'll say no more about the weak story) to the over emphasis on fox hunting, this book is just a thin story with alot of padding. Rita Mae, you really could do much better...."
1,"Brown's ""Full Cry""","I agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer who remarked that Brown should decide if she's going to sermonize or write a mystery. I think she has decided....she's sermonizing. This book wasn't even remotely interesting. A minor mystery was deeply embedded in all Brown's preaching. If you aren't paying attention, it'll slip right past you....And I made the mistake of getting ""The Hounds and the Fury"" at the same time I got ""Full Cry."" I'm not looking forward to it."
1,Off Track,"Brown wqas simply not up to par! I found it a struggle to get through the book when usally I can't put them down. It was obviosly a gross mistake as far as jacket blurb goes. Who let this get by? I hope Rite Mae Brown can get back on track. If not, I will loose one of my favorite authors!"
3,Full Cry,"Having read the other books in this fox hunting series, I can say this one is not up to the standard. The plot line is not as well defined as in the other books. It is rather sketchy to be honest.While Rita Mae Brown fans will probably read it anyway, it is not a book that will draw in new fans."
3,misleading and incomplete,"I would not characterize this book a a murder mystery...for one thing, there was absolutely no mystery about it...and it was hard to get too worked up about the victims. As a horse person, I was enchanted by the decription of the hunting club...but the author assumes that the reader knows a lot more than she does. The dialog between the animals are amusing, but I had to wonder how the author knew this was what the animals were thinking. As a dog and horse owner, I have to say that I don't believe my dogs or horses think this way...they are pretty food-centric.I am going to try the ""outfoxed"" book as from the reviews, it sounds like this would be the better choice."
2,Not up to her usual snuff,"I didn't feel this book was up to the usual quality of Hotspur and Outfoxed. As someone else noted, it was just chit chat...nothing exciting and it took too long to get to the story which barely lasted one chapter. Also, the rodeo antics of Sister Jane at the end were a little unbelievable. I mean come on now...standing in her saddle and jumping onto another horse? I was disappointed in the book. A better read if you haven't read it yet, is Shotgun. I've read that one many times and still enjoy it. In fact, I would like a sequel to see how Pryor is doing. She was an interesting character and I really liked her. So, Rita...how 'bout it? Can we hear more about Pryor?"
2,Not what I expected,"I am listening to the CD audio version of this book. I am very disappointed. The author is reading her book and she has made several mistakes, garbled words and begun over. I thought errors were edited out. I can hear the pages being turned as she reads and on occasion she seems to running out of breath. Didn't she take a break?, ever? I am on disc 7 and have heard more about foxes, hunting dogs and fox hunt detail than the average person would want to hear in their lifetime. This story needs more plot and less hunting detail."
2,only for foxers,"First I have to admit to a Rita Mae Brown bias; I love her work. However, this is just not up to par. The story, not really a mystery, barely a novel, goes off on far too many side excursions with fox hunt stories, hunt clothes, brand names to buy, hoof care for horses, etc. etc. A real yawn if you aren't a ""Master"" of the hunt.As usual, Brown manages to work in a few things to annoy everyone (a fact that usually has me chuckling); i.e., animals are superior to people, biracial sexual encounters between senior citizens, her characters opinions on some people just being 'born bad'etc.)Her editor was asleep a the wheel this time. With about 100 less pages this could have been a good book, As is, Brown's fans will be disappointed. Best advice: If you (like me) MUST read anything she writes, borrow it - don't buy. Save your money for saddle soap."
1,Don't let authors narrate their own work!,"SLOPPY recording; I'm surprised, as Recorded Books usually does a good job. Brown is a bad choice to read her own book; her voice cracks and wavers like a 13 year-old pre-pubescent boy, she has some annoying pronounciations ('conner' for 'corner'), she stresses the wrong words in a sentence, and on at least 3 occasions, she repeats a sentence to correct her reading ('enveloped by a veal (pause) enveloped by a veil' being the most glaring example), which Recorded Books should have corrected in post-production. Perhaps the worst 'professional' reading I've yet heard. Story itself is so-so, but the recording flat out stinks."
1,"Gads, what an eye glazer!!",The first two books in this series (Outfoxed and Hotspur) were great--I couldn't put them down! And God knows I've stayed up way past my bedtime on a work night so I could finish a Mrs. Murphy story. But this one?! Slow cannot begin to describe it! What a big disappointment!
2,Mystery or misery?,"I found this book to be rather dull although I did learn a lot about fox hunting. The description was fabulous but I don't think that it was much of a mystery. I kept reading but I also kept wondering when something was actually going to happen. I did love the character of ""Sister""."
5,Sleepless Nights,"Not many men can say that they caused me sleepless nights, but thanks to his book Guy Jones made the list. Once I started reading I could not put the book down. When I was about two thirds through the book I thought I had figured out who the crook was and felt almost personally challenged by this low-life, but then the plot made another surprising twist and the far more dangerous enemy was somebody I would never have expected. Although there are a lot of astonishing parallels to our current political situation in the world, I can only hope that the book is all fiction and nothing like that could really happen."
2,Steeleye lost their way.,"If you are looking for good Steeleye stuff, as songs available on the ""Below the Salt"" , ""Hark! the Village wait."" or ""Please to see the King"" albums, forget this one. They have lost their way between folkish and experimentalisms that give the listener the impression that they had two or three good ideas but had to extend songs to fill the 30 minutes minimum LP time. You should buy this one only if you are, like me, a collector. C.Escobar"
3,"not their best, but still worthy","I agree with other reviewers that this album is definitely not Span's best. However, because one reviewer singled out ""Awake, awake"" as not being very interesting, I felt compelled to disagree. This is one of the most beautiful and haunting love songs I have ever heard, with Maddy and Tim trading off verses about a couple's infatuation with each other. It surpasses even ""My Love"" from Sails of Silver. Yes, ""The Victory"" is wonderful also, but for me the price of admission is well spent on the first track of this album."
2,"cheap, too light, not for outdoors","I wished I hadn't purchased this tank cart. It's too light, too hard to handle full tanks, and certainly not for use outdoors. The tires are too light, too large and thin, like bicycle tires. The tray that comes with it is a joke, it falls off all the time. It's sitting in the garage unused, I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this. I will be buying a heavy duty one for outdoor use."
4,A Haunted Web of Fun,"Evelyn Axon is an aging medium who lives with her mentally disabled daughter Muriel in a deteriorating Victorian house with a run-down lean-to out back. Muriel's latest social worker, Isabel Field, is having an affair with the history teacher Colin Sidney, whose sister Florence is one of the Axon's neighbors. Will Colin leave his wife and three bratty children for Isabel? What is haunting the Axon house? And who made Muriel pregnant? By turns creepy and funny, Mantel's first published novel is intelligent and eminently readable."
3,A simpler version of Kinsey Millhone,"This is my first McCone book, and my first impression is it is very similar in style to Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone, without quite as much of a hard edge. The writing style is simpler and faster to read than Grafton's, and the mystery was not too terribly hard to solve, given the abundance of bad characters (all of which being guilty of something). I was expecting McCone's houseguest to be the scapegoat, which never really happened. The interplay between McCone and the police was not very realistic. All in all, it was a fun read, but not extremely exciting. The story had the potential to be much more interesting."
4,First time read,FIRST READ BY THIS AUTHOR AND I ENJOYED IT. ENOUGH TO READ MORE.Had never heard of this character and I like series reads.
4,it was okay,"This was your typical Sharon McCone murder mystery. A woman is murdered in Sharon's building, and she sets out to find out who the murderer is. The book allows the readers a look into Sharon's neighborhood - introducing a lot of interesting characters. I picked out the murderer early in the book because he just seemed a little shady, but it wasn't confirmed until late into the book, so it was still interesting trying to figure out why the murderer had done the deed.Overall it was a quick and entertaining read."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this product for my counseling practice. I thought the design was great and that the price was right. Unfortunately, the company marked the order as ""shipped"", only to notify me two days later that they refunded my money because they were out of stock.I'm not sure what kind of game this company is playing advising its customers that the item has shipped before they actually determine whether they have the item in stock; however, I'm disappointed at the lack of professionalism shown by this company."
4,great poster!,"I love this poster, it's great for helping kids and adults better identify their feelings in a way that's fun and non-threatening. I just wish some of the faces were female which is why I don't give it 5 stars."
1,All the expressions look similar,"The concept is admirable. My 2 yr old learned to say some of the expressions from reading book version of this. However, the expressions are not easily distinguishable."
3,Standells - 'Riot On Sunset Strip/Rarities' (Big Beat) 3 1/2 stars,"As it turns out, this is actually another one of those 2-lp's-on-one CD releases. First it's the soundtrack to the 1967 cult film 'Riot On Sunset Strip' that includes just two tracks by the Standells and others like The Mugumps, Mom's Boys, Sidewalk Sounds and Chocolate Watchband. It's a decent collection of '60's garage tunes, I thought. Plus the rest of this disc is a collection of Standell's out-takes. You know, cutting room floor material. Better cuts include the title track ""Riot On Sunset Strip"", ""Batman"", ""School Girl"" and ""Rari"".O kay,I'll admit it, I'm a HUGE Standells fan. A should-have."
5,Outstanding Rosa Parks Documentary for Students Grades 6-12,"This Emmy Award-winning documentary combines real footage, re-enactments, and interviews to tell the story of Rosa Parks from 1943 to the Supreme Court's striking down segregation in 1956. The soundtrack and editing are beautifully combined to create an engaging documentary. My students were spellbound--there wasn't a sound in the room until the end when many clapped and cheered. Make sure to preview the video before showing students; there are instances of mild adult language and use of a racial slur. This unrated film is appropriate for students in grades 6-12."
5,Fun Math Resource,My son loves these and they are well done. They are a good learning tool and are geared for middle school kids.
5,"Dynamite music, great fun.","This is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable and fun CD sets I've heard in a long time. I am even ordering two more sets for a friend to give as gifts. It would be hard to pick favorites here, but Ruth Brown, Candye Kane, Alberta Hunter and Bessie Smith would be at the top. Anyone who likes vintage and contemporary blues would do well to buy this set."
3,Eh,"While it's a good sampler cd (as are all the Essential Blues from the House of Blues series), I have one complaint:The formating of the discs from this pressing seem to be VERY tempermental for some computer cd drives."
5,Must-buy for law students,This is a must-buy for law students taking a class in international tax. Or if you're a lawyer and want to learn the stuff on your own.But I can see how a layman hoping to figure out how to fill out a tax return would think the book to be useless.
2,I'm not employed by a tax lawyer,"This would probably be a great book for a law student, but not for a lay person. I consider myself to be fairly intelligent, but I had a bit of difficulty wading through this to find the little bit of info that I needed. I'm sure it's also a great book for someone with a tax background."
4,Headboard,"Very pleased, it's a beautiful Headboard. I have only one minor thing but it's not a big problem. A nut didn't want to stay on but we have put it back on and hopefully have it tighten this time so it will stay on. It's nice looking and solid, other than the nuts and bolt's staying on and tight we are happy with quality and the look."
3,Computer Desk,This computer desk is larger than expected and a little complicated to put together when it comes to the top of the desk.
4,works surprisingly well,"The lamp has greatly improved my teen sons' skin, especially cystic lesions. They had no side effects. Being teens, they don't always use it daily, but have still seen significant but not perfect results."
4,think it works...,A few months ago I tried this product along with cutting out flour and sugar from my diet and taking vitacure b5 tablets. My skin cleared up a lot and when I stopped doing all this stuff it broke out again. Now I am back to using the light again and hoping that this was what worked before because the other methods were a pain. Curious to see what others think of this product.
1,Snake Oil would be better for your complexion,"I did a lot of reading about using red and blue light to help acne. There is a lot on the Web, but they ALL say that it is best to use them separately -- otherwise you get purple light, which doesn't do anything. Verilux has been selling these for years and have NO clinical data on this particular product - according to their customer service people - they only refer to some old research that was NOT done with their product -- DON'T BUY IT!!"
3,Not Worked Yet,I have to say I started this therapy on Oct. 20th this year and I have seen very little difference in my skin. I have done this every single day for 15-20 min each time. I still get breakouts everyday and the ones that I have the light does not seem to calm them down or take the reddness away. I am giving it a 3 star because I have still not given it the recommened 2 months so I guess I will pray for a miracle in the next month and see what happens. The plus to this is that it has the money back gaurantee and it is so quiet you don't even know it is on. If this does not work then it is Accutane or Laser treatment for me.
5,One of rock's great live albums....,"By refusing to noodle aimlessly (Phish) and flourishing amazing melodic instincts (unlike most Floyd) Spiritualized has created a swelling, mooving and landmark musical set. It's also a concert performance so full of energy and passion that it rivals The Who's here-to unequaled Live At Leeds album. The songs are tight, the writing rivals prime Lou Reed and even the jams move and flow with enought life to become songs on their own. Out paces anything they've everdone before. Stunning."
3,Exploits for better,"3 1/2Spiritualized manage to keep all their stoner-epic grandeur intact and even up the ante with the rare live outing that can be purchased in place of studio output, easily putting Velvet-Underground-meets-Pink-Floyd genetics on display front and center, even if the second disc feels typically over-indulgent."
3,overblown,"Who knows whether this will get published as Amazon has a habit of deleting reviews under 4 stars. But while Spiritualized stock in trade is head music - this performance harks back to the progressive days when bands like Pink Floyd and Emerson, Lake and Palmer ruled the roost. While not as criminally self involved as those bands - Spiritualized leaves me flat. I've made it through the disc twice and besides the enjoyable ""Medication"" and ""I Think I'm in Love"" -I never care to listen to it again. And that speaks volumes."
2,Why did I buy this again?,"I like Spiritualized a lot, but objectivity is more important here than awarding them with a good review merely because I'm partial to the band. This album is not very good. The first three songs are good, especially ""Electric Mainline."" The rest is an uninspired reading of the ...Ladies and Gents... album, and an overproduced one at that. With the exception of adding an orchestra on almost every song (READ: not very interesting), these songs sound exactly the same as the original studio versions. It doesn't even sound like a live album. Jason Pierce is usually meticulous; it would have helped to think LONG and HARD before unloading this on the public."
5,Soaring Beauty,This is an extraordinary record. It's served as a worthy entree to their catalog for me.Especially good for the subway. Loud as hell. And dense enough to proclaim headphone discoveries on even the sleepiest of mornings.This is head music. You don't need to be dosed to enjoy it thoroughly. Not at all.
5,Excellent buy,Excellent with or without oil. It was worth the buy. But make sure you have a white or light colored sheet under your child's hair and your lap.
1,Used lice comb.,I didn't get a chance to use it. The seal was broken. The comb is dirty and sticky. I guess this is not a product I should get on the internet.
3,Ok,"I liked that it gave advice on how to handle some of the situations, but it didn't give useful advice on most issues. It mainly tells you how to handle it in your head, but not how to communicate with these relatives when they are pushing your buttons."
3,"Not Terrible, but ...","This one didn't do it for me because it didn't help much with my problems. It seemed as though the problems discussed here were oversimplified and stereotypical and this book is written for those people whose problems are with family members they don't care much about -like annoying in-laws. There was some helpful info, but most of the book was not applicable to me. Mostly, it gave common sense, basic advice and offered nothing extraordinary. For instance, the book somewhere mentioned - If family gatherings are stressful for you, consider making them shorter or with less people. (I think anyone could tell you that.)"
2,Get another book......that's all I can say,"I purchased this book at the point of desparation. My family, husband and I and two grown sons hadn't talked for two years because of a Legal Will that wasn't pleasing to them.We needed a book to help us with wisdom on how to handle this horrible situation - general advice, nothing too specific (actually, I'm sure few buying the book have our specific problem.)What did we get? A book on how to deal with teenagers, uncle 'fred' who drinks too much, and on and on.This was of less use to us than one visit to a Psychologist would be and that would have been money better spent.If you're having family problems that are average, this book may help. If you're having family {{{PROBLEMS}}} that have you hunting for some help, this isn't the book for you. I'm sure one is out there, but this definitely is not the one."
3,There is always one in every family!,"This book provides some insight into why some people behave badly, as they do, at family gatherings and the book offers suggestions to assist in the management of these social occasions. The most comforting information that I gained from this book is the knowledge that there are many other dysfunctional families like mine and as bad as mine. This book is worth a read, but I am not sure if the theoretical knowledge translates into practice and that is why I have only given it 3 stars. I don't have confidence putting theory into practice at the risk of creating world war 3."
1,VERY Misrepresented,"I was very disapointed with this product from this seller. I have had an entire class of 18 people who all purchased this book on Amazon and not one had a problem... except for me. I order a ""like new"" book and it came to me with almost every paage heavily highlighted and a very bent and beat up cover."
4,This is poison!!!,"Not long ago Blue Scholars started blowing up the spot here in Seattle, then this side project from Sabzi comes out and... BAAAAMMMMMM!!! This LP brings back the boom bap vibe that Seattle's hip-hop sceene was in the mid to late 90s. Memories of Jeru, Artifacts and Common's ""Ressurection"" LP all float to the surface when listening to this LP. (It doesn't hurt that blastmaster KRS endorses the album!)In my opinion I think this LP was better than both releases from Blue Scholars ""Blue Scholars"" & ""The Long March EP."" Reguardless, all three releases are dope and worth checking out. I have a feeling that these releases will ring the alarm and people will take notice to the Seattle Hip-Hop sceene."
3,Maybe a little too dummy,"This is a handy reference especially for those who don't know much about writing cover letters and who haven't ever been to a career counselor. It's also useful for anyone else, though I can't imagine that it's much different from other books on the topic.The major annoyance I had was with the sample letters that are included, and with some of Joyce Kennedy's suggestions, which seemed more obnoxious than anything. I can see how some employers may find them amusing, but if I were in a human resources department, I would not hire many of the people who wrote these examples.To be sure, some of the samples are alright, and there is much to learn in the many tips that Kennedy provides. If you're seeking to be a competitive prospective employee, you may find it worthwhile to get this book. I hope, however, that there is another book on cover letters out there with sample letters that are still interesting to read, but more serious and intelligent."
3,Good traveling mouse however..,This mouse is very compact and easy to install and use. The one thing that I have found wrong with this sometimes they respond and behave in a wierd way. It is like some signal from who knows where is grabbing the mouse and moving it on it's own accord. I have two of these and have purchased one for my sister and have found that they are inconsistent. One of mine is perfect however the other one is sporadic and my sisters sometimes has a mind of its own. I will be looking forward to a new series of these as I find this to be too inconsistent with it's performance.
5,It's an Outstanding cd,I recived it as a gift and i was thinking (MAN THIS IS PROBABLY GONNA SUCK) but when i listened to it It Blew me away. They have great lyrics and a catchy Blues Beat. I'm Really glad I have that cd.......... I SUGEST YOU BUY IT!!!!!
5,Number One Guide for Getting and SBA Loan,"This is by far the most informative book on small business financing through the SBA that I have ever read. Patrick D. O'Hara, PhD, tells you how to secure financing and get your piece of the estimated $6 billion in loans given out or secured by the SBA each year! Everything you need to know is here, including filling out forms, writing your business plan and sections describing all the SBA loan programs and their requirements. This book will fully prepare you for apply for a loan from the SBA. This newest edition provides an up-to-date listing of the very latest programs and additions to previous ones. A definate must-read."
1,Dead Angel is much better,It is not finished by jerry but by people who were not there all they knew was that jerry loved Harrington st for a true account of harrington st see Dead angel by John Clark
3,Decent stereo receiver,"I got exactly what I wanted with this HK3485 stereo receiver. I was not interested in having a full featured home theater setup since I like to play my music independently of my TV. This is a good, full-featured receiver with all the inputs/outputs that I needed for my cd, phonograph, and satellite radio."
1,Do not buy with the Bridge,"*Buyer beware*Don't buy the iPod Bridge for this unit.This receiver is fine. But it does not attach to the Bridge (iPod docking station).There is no input for the custom Bridge cable, so you cannot possibly play them together, despite Amazon's selling them together."
5,Very good and bursting with Irony.,"First of all, I enjyed this book very much and I would definitely recommend it to anybody who like reading. The story is set in northern england and the opening page tells us about a two-bit crook who has been ""stabbed-in-the-back"" by his so-called accomplices. he has just been let out of prison. As he makes way to find one of his henchmen, he stumbles accross a scruffy looking figure designing a picture on the pavement. This is Rembrant- so called for his artistic ablities. Now Rembrant is a stocky figure and much bigger than."
5,The software that accompanies this book is GREAT!,I have used the book with its software for 4 years! My students love it
3,A truly refreshing book on Islam with slight impudence thrown in,"I was truly enjoying this book till I came to the passages where author casually referred to the mother of believers Khadija, may Allah be please with her in a somewhat inapproprate way.Aside from a few instances of such impertinence on the author's part, this is a truly refreshing read on Islam from a Western Muslim's point of view. Loaded with compelling arguments and hypotheses for Islam."
5,A Challenging work!,"This excellent introduction to Islam is written from a position so contrary to nearly all the basic assumptions of popular Western culture that reading it can bring about a shock of sorts. If this is your first taste of Eaton's writings or of the so called 'Traditionalist' school then this book is going to be very challenging. ""Islam and the Destiny of Man"" along with his other work ""Remembering God"" have both caused me to question certain aspects of my worldview. A book that makes you think and threatens your comfy little world imagine that. None of the idols of Occidental ""modernity"" are safe! I really can't recommend this book enough. If you want a good introduction to Islam it's hard to get better then this."
1,Wrong Edition,"The picture and look inside guide of this book is in accurate. I needed to buy this book for class, the edition shown from 1994, but I was sent the 1985 edition, which has alot missing. The 85 edition is about 50 pages shorter.It is possible that somewhere Amazon said that it was the 1985 edition (although the cover shown is from the 1994 edition), but I could not find it."
3,"Good, but it must be balanced with Bat Ye'or","I found this to be a very worthwhile book. However, my enthusiasm is tempered by reading any of the very well researched books of Bat Ye'or. She has a way of putting Islam fully into perspective."
5,Excellence in faith and expression,"I have little to add to the other reviews lauding the brilliance with which this book is written, the excellence of its philosophy, and the sympathetic exegesis of Islam: indeed all of the Abrahamic religions. The one sour review you will read says it all about the excellence of this work.I am a born-again, Bible believing Christian. It is a pleasure to read such a surrender to the wisdom of God, the Author of history, even if the true nature of Christ isn't, sadly, acknowledged.I discovered this book entirely by accident, and cannot understand why it is not vastly better known. Do not let this gem of a book escape your careful attention!"
5,Dovlatov must read...,"If you like Dovlatov you must read this. If you never read Dovlatov, read this and you will like Dovlatov. I've read it about a year ago and can't give you details right now, but the description of the Russian immigrant community, as well as all of the heroes of the book is amazing. Dovlatov's satire hits right on target, it will make you smile and angry at the same time. If you are an immigrant, you will see your neigbours in this story, or maybe you will see yourself. If not, try not to make stereotypes after reading this. But as far as stereotypes go, the ones here are some come to life and talk to you from the pages. Just read."
1,SUCKS!,"Sooooooo Bad! Everything about this movie is bad. Terrible, lame and not funny at all. We really don't recommend this movie."
1,Might actually be the worst movie ever made,"I'll never watch another film with Hill in it.It's so bad, that's all I'm willing to take the time to say about it."
1,Couldn't Finish the Movie,The movie was horrible. I couldn't even finish it. My teenager downloaded it from Amazon Prime. I decided to watch it since we had the rental but was so appalled that I couldn't even finish the movie.
3,Pretty funny,"Not a bad movie.At least it was R rated and was funnier than an Apatow movie and an Adam Sandler movie.The best part of the movie was the three kids that Jonah Hill takes care of.The kids and Jonah Hill have a good connection.I thought Danny Mcbride was in this film but Sam Rockwell from Iron Man 2 is in here playing a drug dealer with a bodybuilder gang.Pretty weird but it was different.Jonah Hill is way funnier and entertaining playing the fat version instead of the skinny,yet still loser version like he did in 21 jumpstreet.Worth at least a watch once"
2,not worth your time,Yah - Pretty below average movie for Jonah Hill. Predictable plot and characters - this has all been done before. Was too bored to finish watching it.
1,so bad,Not good at all. Writing is poor and acting is worse. Some attempts at humor are very overdone. One of the ten worst movies I have ever seen.
3,Good for a laugh,"This was pretty funny. It wasn't great and it didn't break any new ground, but I laughed. If you are a fan of David Gordon Green and/or Jonah Hill, you will like it.The Sitter is definitely a case of a movie showing the best parts in its trailer. There is a soft, moral lessen push that gets a little clunky towards the end of thepicture. It's as if the director was making up for some of the harsher comedy. There was no need. This is a comedy, just let it be funny."
4,The Sitter,"I have watched this movie three times. As a person with younger siblings, this movie made me laugh so hard at the ways the kids act and the whole story line. It is not the best movie ever, but it is funny and a good time. If you're looking for a funny movie that doesn't take itself seriously, give this one a try."
2,Swing and a miss,"I will start out with the positive. The movie does has a couple of laugh out loud moments. That is about where the positives end. What is odd is that this is a raunchy comedy that is actually trying to be a message movie. We have 3 troubles kids, Jonah and a female friend. For some reason the writer decided that by the end of the movie the main character needed to solve all of the problems for the 3 kids, his mother, his girlfriend and of course, himself. Trust me, I did not rent this movie for some good lessons on life."
1,A waste of 90 minutes and 4 bucks,"I rented this movie to watch on a flight from Atlanta to Boston. I guess it was better than doing nothing, but honestly, not by much. I will admit I chuckled at a few points in the film, but more because it was so absurd and not because it was particularly funny. The writers apparently think that the more f- and s- bombs in the dialog, the funnier the script. Really, it's not. It's more pathetic than anything else. Frankly, the aggressively selfish overweight Jonah Hill swearing, threatening and criticizing a 13-year old and two younger kids, stealing the family car, stealing checks at a bat mitzvah party, heading into Manhattan in the middle of the night, buying drugs for a girl just so he might get laid (how he was going to manage that with the kids in tow is a mystery), etc. made me cringe much more than anything else. Save your money."
2,wtf,"horrible movie..i did not expect for Jonah Hill to be in a movie this bad, good thing i only rented it and didn't purchase it."
2,are you kidding me?,"this movie sucked so bad, how did this talentless pig become a star? So much to dislike about The Sitter!"
2,wasted time,If you want a couple of laughs and want to waste some time here ya go otherwise wouldn't watch again.
4,Jonah Hill is hillarious!!!,"This movie is ridiculously funny! Jonah Hill is one of my favorite up and coming comedians. Its like a modern day Adventures in Babysitting (a classic)and instead of playboys and thor look alikes its got drug dealers and a misunderstood trio of kids, one of which can't help but to blow things up! Definitely didn't regret watching this movie!"
1,blah,"horrible movie, one of those that only the preview is funny. disappointed as usually Jonah Hill is pretty funny guy"
2,Poor Sitter Movie,"Poor movie not really that funny, its a poor substitute to adventures in babysitting which is more enjoyable than the sitter"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS MOVIE,Not alot to say about this movie other than it is really bad. If you just don't have anything else to do for an hour and half go for it. You will be wishing you had both your money and your time back.
4,The Sitter,When I rent this movie I thought it was going to be funnier than it was. If you like this kind of movie get it.
2,Very bad film,"I like Jonah Hill and I wanted to like this movie but it was just a very, very bad film. I cringe at anyone who gives this 5 stars, which is the highest amount of stars you can give something. Does that mean that this film is one of the greatest of all time? I mean, you gave it the same amount of stars as you would give The Godfather or Duck Soup/Blazing Saddles if you're only looking at comedies.To get back on track, if you like Jonah Hill, you're going to get this anyway. Unless you're stupid and have horrible taste in movies, you're going to regret it."
3,Moderately humurous.,"Nothing too special in my opinion. It's okay if you're looking for a few laughs and a cliche comedy story line in which raunchy humor and loopholes follow your mind throughout the movie. I really disliked the children in the movie, if it wasn't for Jonas hill I wouldn't have chuckled once while watching this flick."
2,Boooo.,"A low for Jonah Hill. It was incredibly disappointing, and it made very little sense. I understand it is supposed to be a comedy, but look to The Hangover, or I Love You, Man. These movie's humor makes sense, and the characters make sense. The movie is not the worse thing I've ever seen, but it surely is a disappointment."
2,Sitter movie,the video was great movie was stupid Save your money.Not funny not funny not funny save your money rent another video
2,Not all that funny,The kids were annoying and it was hard to like any other characters. Movie just dragged on. A couple of mildly funny parts but the rest was either irritating or just plain boring.
2,After School special,The movie had promise but degraded into a bad after school special. There were some gems mixed in with the crap. Skip this and pre-order 21 Jump Street.
3,adventures in babysitting,"basically a rework of 1987's adventures in babysitting, a tad predictable, and ari graynor - so excellent in nick and norah's infinite playlist - is wasted here. that said, you get what you expect with jonah hill. not the worst movie, and not the raunchiest."
2,I expected better,"I purchased this after seeing 21 Jump Street in theaters. I thought 21 Jump Street was so funny, I saw it twice in two days. So, thinking I would stay on my Jonah high, I bought this. It's not very funny at all; despite a pretty decent cast; and it failed on almost every level. I only managed to chuckle two or three times, and the majority of the movie was really flat and lame. Other reviewers have compared it to Adventures in Babysitting, and the plot is quite similar but they tried to drive it in a more adult-direction. I had high hopes for this, I think Jonah Hill will eventually become one of our funniest and most celebrated actors ever and I've never seen Sam Rockwell in anything I didn't think was brilliant. Rent it on PPV or netflix if you really want to see it, but save your money and buy 21 Jump Street when it comes out."
2,"I had hopes, but the earlier reviews were right, it's not very good","I wanted to like it going in, and while it doesn't do anything wrong exactly, it doesn't do the humor very well, and obviously for a comedy that equals failure. The tender moments where the hapless Sitter teaches the kids how to be better people are actually effective and probably the best parts of the movie. All the other subplots (girlfriend, drug dealer, new potential girlfriend, father, old high school acquaintance with a grudge)seem very false and contrived as does the third, adopted, child - his role is completely a waste, unfunny, probably racist and totally unrealistic. The other two kids were likeable enough behind terrible scripting. I don't blame Jonah Hill, he was reasonably funny, he just didn't have much to work with. I blame the director, and I'd say if you didn't like Pineapple Express, like I didn't, you likely won't enjoy The Sitter either."
1,Best watched while asleep.,"I have liked Jonah Hill's movies, but this thing was nothing but crude, vulgar, and completely without humor. The trailer would have you thinking this would be a really funny movie. It was anything but that."
4,We all need to laugh,"This is a somewhat typical Jonah Hill comedy, with a doing the right thing outcome in the end. Good, funny entertainment for a Winter evening."
3,Formulaically funny,"Jonah Hill is good in this. It had such a common plot. Pacing was good, kid actors were good. Entertaining."
4,Adventures in babysitting meets the pacifier,"What is funny is that both my wife and myself at the same time looked at each othe and said this movie remind us of a remake of adventures in babysitting. I actually liked the film, but I feel from seeing the previews did not live up to the advertisements. My wife cared for it less but i rather enjoyed it and 4 stars is being super nice, but i thought the kids were cute. They definitely could have tuned up the ending a bit but all in all it's a funny, entertaining film if you don't expect too much out of it!~shauns movie review"
1,for shame Jonah Hill,This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The movie needs to decide if it wants to be a Nickelodeon comedy or a really bad version of Super Bad. Either way it would still be something terrible to watch. Only way this movie could have been any worse is if tried to rip more parts of adventures in babysitting which it did try very hard to do. Should have just thrown away the $3.99 it cost me to rent.
1,One of the worst movies I have ever watched,"Just awful, right up there with the ""Good-bye Girl"" and ""Space Balls"" in terms of bad movies.DO NOT rent this movie. You will regret it if you rent it."
1,the sitter sucked,"Horrible ,stupid a bad remake of adventures in Babysitting and that was n't that great either.do not waste your money or time on this one"
1,I would give it a 0 if I could,This was horrible. Mostly bad words from the kids and the other characters - I want my money back for this - I really regret that I rented this move. I wouldn't even watch this on TBS.
4,Forget what others say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I dont see why most people are saying they didn't like this movie? I watched it twice & found myself laughing at it both times, i acually liked it & thought it was a good movie."
2,expected,No one else gave it 2 stars so I thought I'd be the first. The movie could have been better.
2,boring and borderline racist,This movie isn't very good at all. It drags on and on in places and skips over good ideas in others. I generally think Jonah Hill is pretty funny but his character isn't very interesting in this flick
2,This movie is BAD -- and I am someone who can watch anything,"This movie is bad, folks. It's rare that I regret spending $3.99 to watch a movie on Amazon but I wish I could ask for my money back for this one. It's just bad. I love Jonah Hill and thought this would be a modern spin on ""Adventures in Babysitting"" or even ""Uncle Buck"", but it's actually boring most of the time. I think the only really interesting thing about it is that Jonah helps one of the kids he's babysitting figure out and come to terms with the fact that he's gay -- that was a surprise the movie went there, and the way it was handled was well-done and beneficial to the kid. But the rest of the movie feels like it was written over a weekend and the movie was made for $2 million dollars and filmed over the following weekend. I didn't find any of it funny, and I actually felt bad for Jonah Hill because he's usually in much better movies.Avoid this one unless it's ever on here for free with Prime membership."
2,The Sitter,Was definitely disappointed with this one. I expected a lot more laughs from Jonah Hill and a less unrealistic plot. I thought the whole basis could've been funny but between the illicit drug plot and crazy children I found it unbelievable.
4,enjoyable,"Started off good. Ended good. It got a little tiresome with so many things going wrong for poor Noah, but they pulled everything together nicely, and left me feeling good. I enjoyed it overall. Too me, I would give 3 stars to a movie that was just ok, but I had a good time here, and so I gave it 4 stars."
1,Not a goof movie for inlaw night...,"Don't watch this with your in-laws. The movie opens with a guy eating a girl out. Seriously? Wow. We turned it off and my face turned red. I was prepared for some raunch, but not within the first minute."
1,Do not waste your time,"Not funny comedy with very poor actor play, save your time and money, watch some other movie. The plot and adventures of main characters are way too lame."
3,Just ok,"Like Jonah! I guess I had great expectations for a good laugh, but not quite. Maybe that,s what it was."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting this to be a good movie since I like a lot of Jonah Hill's other movies. However, it was not very entertaining and not very funny. There were a few chuckles, but most of the time I kept asking myself ""why am I still watching?""."
3,Thought it was funny,had a few good laughs watching this movie. Good one to put on if you have company over. Would only watch again if I was at a party or drunk.
2,lame,Skip it. This movie lacks nearly everything fun. I wanted to like it but I just couldn't. My wife and I were ready to shut it off about half way in.
2,terrible!,"I love the the actor, hated this movie. It was just stupid. I was watching it with 2 other people and we had to turn it off it was that bad."
3,Too much,There are too many trivial things going on but Noah is funny as always so it makes up for the over embelished storyline.
1,like...Whaaat?,"Stupid from the start and kept going down the ignorant Hollywood road of typical made up stereotypes and social programming. How about a babysitter movie about a babysitter who takes care of a gay or lesbian couple's adopted or artificially inseminated children and then tells one of their children who ""has issues"" that he or she is actually straight and not gay or lesbian. And then the child realize it's true that their a normal heterosexual and that their `liberal' nuclear age parents who were `constantly' telling them ""its ok for them to be gay"" was actually all a part of their rainbow coalition religious social programming.Now that would be a movie!!!"
4,An outstanding work.,"I am niether Catholic or Protestant as in my own experience I have been persecuted myself by both ""Christian"" movements for what I chose to believe.I found Fox's book facinating not because it upheld one set of dogma against another but because there are some quite sustainable facts. I decided to examine one entry in great detail, because I happen to live 2 minutes away from where the martyrdom is said to have taken place.(Joan Waste who was burned at the stake in Derby)What makes this account different to most others is because she was only 22 and blind and made her stand against Catholic teaching of ""Transubstantiation"" based on what she had had read to her from the Bible itself. Her story is substatiated from other local sources and interlocks with known local history.Truly a fine example ,( not of upholding protestantisim ) but of upholding true Bible doctrine."
5,everyone should know,anyone interested in sininary should be aware of the sacrefices of the followers of Jesus Christ and what they had to do through
5,Very Good Book,This book should be read and reread -- loyalty to Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of Christ must be celebrated!
4,Foxes Book of Martyrs,"This is an excellent work that everyone should read. It details some of the horrendous fallout of the cosmic battle between Good and Evil an expecially how the Catholic Church went ""off the rails"" during the dark ages including burning people at the stake for even owning a Bible..."
3,Sacrafice for Christ,The sacrafice that people have went threw to not deny the Lord. Incredible and Horiffic. Leaves you thinking that what we go through today is nothing compared to what others have gone through to get us where we are today.
1,Not What It Pretends To Be,"This book is not what it pretends to be. I expected an objective and historic account of Christian martyrs over the centuries. While it starts out that way - maybe that the piece actually written by Foxe - but it quickly devolves into the alleged atrocities committed by the Catholic Church after the initial Christian conversion of Europe. While there is no doubt that the Catholic Church committed its share of atrocities in the name of Jesus and should be rightly condemned, the book ultimately lacks balance. For example, the book covers more than 50 individual ""persecutions"" during the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary of England. Yet, there is almost no mention of the martyrdom of the well-known Saint Thomas More at the hands of King Henry VIII. This book is little more than a rant in the name of John Foxe. I would recommend trying something else."
5,"When ""Don't Take Life Too Seriously"" pays off.","Here is a devil-may-care character, Blacky Lee, whose side-kick (affectionately called ""Sweetheart"" by Blacky), can't bear all the trouble Blacky seeks out and finds. But Blacky is never concerned nor worried. He actually knows how to manipulate people -- for their own good, without their realizing it. It is an uplifting read."
3,Unreadable liner notes,"Just got this CD and have only listened to it once. Most cuts are OK or better. On first listen the standout is Etta James' Ball and Chain. Unfortunately, the liner notes are unreadable. The type's too small, thin or bold. Some backgrounds give poor contrast. Minimizing page count and being artsy/fartsy seem to be more important to House of Blues (HoB) than readability. I have one other HoB CD and it's even less readable. They must believe their audience are the people who think Wired mag's design is cool. Perhaps if one's 15, it is. If you're 35 or older and are compelled to give HoB your hard earned money, prepare to also invest in an optical magnifier."
2,A bit disappointed.,"I expected a bit more after all the hype on ""Fox and Friends"". I am a fan of Steve Doocy's, but this book wasn't as entertaining as it was claimed to be. I read it in one sitting. I found myself 'pushing forward' in hopes to get to the good parts that everyone raved about, but I never quite found the humor. It's an OK read for a rainy afternoon (or when you're just sitting, awaiting for your child's dance practice to end). Get it from a friend or the local library. Not worth buying for your own personal library."
3,Boring,I like watching Steve Doocy on Fox & Friends but this book is a disappointment. It's not funny and is actually quite boring. Too bad - he's a funny guy on TV.
1,awful,Wow is this book bad! I thought his stupid comments on Faux and Fiends were bad. You actually bet dumber reading it.
1,About As Entertaining,as watching paint dry. Maybe that explains the cut-rate price. How much does Murdoch pay you people to come on and write good reviews for such crappy writing?
1,Just as funny as a 1954 Danny Thomas routine!,"If Yakov Smirnoff had been American and had written a book about marriage, it would have been this one! All the depth of a Full House episode, all the wisdom of a Ziggy cartoon, all the humor of a root canal, The Mr and Mrs Happy Handbook makes the incredibly insightful and oh-so-true points that men like plasma tv's and women like to shop (with their husband's money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). Because when you're fighting over putting paprika on your potato salad for sixteen years(hey, Mr. Doocy, here's a new entry for your handbook - walk over to the damn spice rack and put your own paprika on your portion! Fight solved!), you know you have a wild and wacky marriage. My favorite part was George W. Bush's marriage tips - talk about a real civil war! HAHAHAHAHA!"
5,A great book- the laughs never stop.,I read the whole thing in one night- it was great. Could not stop laughing. This one goes on my gift giving list.
5,I CAN RELATE TO THESE STORIES,"GREAT BOOK, I LOVED IT SO MUCH I GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER AND DAUGHTER IN LAW FOR XMAS..... THEY ALSO LOVED IT....."
3,"I love Steve on TV, but.......","the book is only mildly amusing. I read it on the airplane and had a few chuckles, but not the hysterically funny read I thought it would be. The upside is that it is clear Steve and his wife have a wonderful marriage and he is a dedicated family man. Three cheers for that!"
5,with the world around us in turmoil,"This was such a refreshing , humorous and down to earth bookI and my husband loved it very muchI am 78 and all these things have come to passwe loved it. Shirley L Jones"
5,Funny but Close to Home,"This was a very funny book, and I could identify with a lot of the situations in it. Steve Doocy is not only a great TV personality but he comes across as a really down to earth good guy and it shows in his book. Mrs. Doocy must be pretty special, too."
4,nice border,"this product was exactly as pictured on line and has worked well for my garden edging - if you are looking for a simple and easy border product, this one works very well and looks nice"
4,Nice for the garden.,"We bought these as edging for our front lawn that borders an alley. They look a bit cheesy right out of the box, but are fairly attractive and realistic-looking once in the ground. Hubby said they were very easy to install. Note that once in the ground, the ""bricks"" don't appear very large at all, but they are nice looking, reasonably priced and easy to install."
2,dont recommend,this product looks okay at best. I found it impossible to keep items interlocked while driving them into the ground. When you drive into ground via left or right side the other side comes out of the ground. This was very frustrating and too expensive for what it is!
3,? Shipped Seperately ?,"I like these Dover sticker books. They are $1.50 and I use them on correspondence, on my calendar and as stocking stuffers or in themed gift baskets. I always keep a few on my wish list if I need just a bit extra to get free shipping. One of my items was held up and they sent this on it's own. I'm glad I guess because I wanted it for a gift bag. But I feel bad that it was sent in it own box; seems like a waste."
4,Police Procedural on Yorkshire Moors,"Ben Cooper must be the most likeable detective ever featured in English crime fiction. He is the local boy made good, everybody's best friend (even some of the criminals he apprehends!), with the exception of the ambitious, hard case Diane Fry who happens to be Ben's boss. Fry bullies Ben unmercifully in a very unPC manner but the suspicion is that there is a deep underlying friendship (or more?) between the two. It will be interesting reading the following books in the series to see how Stephen Booth maintains and/or resolves this tension.The descriptions of the moors, villages, and local characters are comprehensive and very enjoyable to this reader although at times the storyline does seem to bog down with the travelogue taking prime place.Nevertheless the intricate twists and turns in the plot keep the reader intrigued and requires a level of concentration to keep all the players in focus leading to another unexpected but staisfying conclusion."
4,Cime novel at its best,Stephen Booth is a master at suspense. I've read everything I can get my hands on. Now I've decided to collect all his titles so that I can reread at my leisure. Blood on the Tongue further develops the Fry and Cooper characters. This tale was masterfully crafted and I enjoyed how past and present mysteries were intertwined.
5,Rosary CD that is absolutely beautiful,I have searched for many years for a Rosary CD. Then I found Fr. Benedict's creation with Simonetta's music. I have since given these away to people who find it difficult to say the Rosary and they too have enjoyed it immensely. Do BUY IT! You will not be sorry.
4,Beautiful and peaceful rendition of the rosary,"Fr. Groeschel recites meditations and prayers in a voice that allows you to meditate and pray along with him attentively.The only thing missing is the Luminous Mysteries, which makes it a disappointing package."
5,The Rosary is a Place,"The Rosary is a Place has had a profound impact in my life. I have prayed the rosary almost daily for a long time and have many audio versions but this one by Fr. Benedict Groeschel & Simonetta has made all the difference. The idea that the Rosary can be a Place, a private, peaceful chapel, that I can go to in times of joy and in times of sorrow has filled me with a quiet assurance that I need so desperately in today's hectic world. The background music is non-obstrusive and soothing; the pace of the prayers is just perfect. Father's Groeschel's insights into the mysteries are truly unique and blessed with holy insight. Please order this Rosary - it will make a difference in your life too."
5,The best and most beautiful version...Peaceful and captivating,I used to listen to this nightly on the radio but can no longer find it...i was happy to find the CD finally so i can send it toshare it's beauty with others...If you are ever down just play this..
2,Like all the other Christmas albums I own...,"Have to tell you, I was suckered in by the Ultimate title, and a singer or two that sounded more recent. It turned out to be just another same ole Christmas album with one or two songs I hadn't heard. Some of the songs are just plain not good renditions - IMHO, of course."
2,"great selection, sub par sound","SO..... Its the time of year for Christmas music. This year, I am loading my ipod with Christmas music, and broadcasting it to my co workers and customers. Daunting task, because SOOOO Many Christmas discs, contain overlapping songs. So, i have to listen to them and decide which contains the best sound quality and no duplicates (obviously duplicate songs, but not duplicate versions). Right now, i am at 1083!So.... I ripped, 13 songs from this cd. When i deleted the ones that were inferior to other duplicates, I was left with only 2 and both were the only ones i had. It was surprising to me, considering that this is a Universal release.I give the content 3.5 stars, and 1 for sound"
2,Beware - Amazon track listing is wrong,"CD arrived in the mail today, the track listing advertised is not for this CD. Songs are the same, artist are all different. Was not looking for a CD with Kenny G and Dionne Warwick. To be fair, looking at the positive reviews they all appear to be for the actual CD, not what is advertised, many reference songs by Boys II Men or Bing Crosby's White Christmas."
3,Usual playlist,"It's an overall great cd. I do have a problem however, with the artists that are included in this playlists. I don't think Eartha Kitt and Boyz 2 Men should be on the same cd."
4,Good book for married couples,I purchased this book after reading the complete idiots guide to a healthy relationship. It is a very helpful book if you and your partner are going through a hard time. I purchased two and me and my boyfriend would read a chapter a night and then talk about it. It has helped us grow closer as a couple and there is much sound advice in the book.One thing i didn't like however is the emphasis on sex. Thats why i gave this book only 4 stars and said this would be better for married couples. The book tends to imply you can't have a relationship without sex and that is probably true for adults that are married but for teenagers i disagree.
4,Nice Jacket,This is a really nice jacket for the price. The sleeves only have a thin lining and the main part has a thick fleece lining.
3,Port Authority Jacket JP54,The jacket looks nice. Feels good. but is not extra warm as described !! and it is not warm too ! Only 3 stars from me :(
3,The quality does not justify the cost,"My husband needed a new jacket so I sent him this one and he did not like it. The jacket is very thin, more like a ""windbreaker"" type jacket. The cost was about $60 and it was wayyyy overpriced. This would have been a perfect buy if it was priced right. The quality of this jacket does not justify the price, in our opinion anyway."
3,John Stamos Rides Again,"This action movie is a fond memory for me. I originally watched it because of John Stamos, but now that I don't really care one way or another about him, I still appreciate the movie a little for what it is; a motorcycle/war/action flick. Stamos does a bang-up job, there is an exploding motorcycle for those who go for that, and of course, a little love story on the side. So, if you like Stamos, or if you like to see motorcycles burst into flames, watch this movie."
5,Great Motorcycle Movie,"I looked all over my area for this movie and could not find it. While perhaps not the best made movie, it does show the WWII harleys used at that time. I loved watching it and would recamend that anyone that has an interest for old harleys, whatch it."
1,STAMOS STINKS UP DULL FILM,"A TRIBUTE TO WHAT REALLY BAD ACTING IS.NO SCRIPT, JUST JOHN STAMOS AND ALOT OF BAD STUNT DRIVING.GO BACK TO KIDDIE SITCOMS DUDE."
2,Value Set but you will quickly outgrow it,"I do a lot of machine shop work therefore I have used many kinds of screw drivers. This set is value priced (ie. cheaper). For occasional home use (ie. once every 6 months or so), it is ok. If you use screw drivers more frequently than this, I suggest you look else where. First, the grips/handles are not good when applying lots of torque. They are made of smooth plastic and doesn't provide a lot of friction. I often found my hands slipping when applying lots of force. Second, the shafts are round, not rectangular/square, which means when the application is really tough, you cannot use a wrench as auxilliary handle for more torque. Thirdly, the screw drivers wear out fast. Especially the phillips (+ shaped). But I am sort of rough on tools, so the above opinions may not apply to you."
1,Weak...,"These are very weak quality screwdrivers. You may expect a quality product from a company like Stanley but, thats not what you will receive. These drivers will bend like a gymnist with the slightest pressure."
2,Stronger than first book in the series...,"I have to admit that I am really regretting my decision to re-read this fantasy series. I have yet to discover why I liked it as a child, and frankly, now that I know that none of the questions and issues raised in the last book (this is the second book in the sort of prequel series), I am having an even more difficult time just reading them. This particular installment was more entertaining thanThe Dragon's Touchstone (Dragon Nimbus History), but the action and plot still move very slowly. The characters have not become more realistic, either."
3,Mammals of Europe,A reasonably priced reprint of a historical work. This makes it a nice addition to any paleo collection.
4,Good for price.,"Pro's:I was astonished by the clavier. To me personally I preferred this key-feel above the standard Yamaha feel.The piano sounds where ok; above what I had expected of Casio.Didn't have many sounds.The internal speakers did the job, and the wooden stand that came with it, made it look like a more expensive piano.The wheight is only 11kg's, with an additional few kg's for the stand. Together it doesn't wheigh more then 15Kg's.I happened to believe it has Midi in/out, but I'm not sure of that.Cons:It has no line out. Internal speakers, or headphones are needed.One mini-jack headphones out.I don't own the item, only briefly played it.Reason to buy it:If you're looking for a decent budget home piano for the livingroom, without disturbing the neighbors while playing; and still have a good quality feel on it; then this is a buyer!"
4,Excellent low priced midi controller,"I was looking for a realistic piano feel keyboard as a midi controller. While the CDP100 may lack many bangs & whistles of the more expensive dedicated controllers, the pros entirely outweigh the cons. It is MUCH lighter. It is much cheaper. It feels at least as realistic. It is acoustically quieter than any modern dedicated controller. It still offers 16 midi out channels. As a sound source, very limited. I haven't heard the pianos on larger speakers so it's not fair to comment. The 1/8"" headphone out jack is the only way to get audio out of the machine. This is a very weak alternative to a 1/4"" stereo output. To make matters more unreliable, the speakers shut off when this is plugged in. Therefore it's probably a normalled 1/8"" jack - the most undependable connection imaginable, & I would expect to develop problems with the internal speakers cutting out if the jack is used regularly. Bottom line, I do intend to buy one, if somewhat reluctantly."
2,Noisy Action,"While the price for this ultra light drew me it, it flunked my first test. I played it with power off, just to get a better sense of the action. While the weighted keys gave it a more authentic feel than most electronic keyboards, the action was very loud. Even with a soft touch the keys rebounded with a clatter. While this might be buried in the music of louder playing, it is very distracting for softer pieces. Real piano keys don't make noise on rebound. I didn't buy the Casio."
4,"Bear Archery Youth Safetyglass Target Arrows - 26""","Got these arrows for 7 and 10 year olds to use with the Bear Goblin Bow. Right size bow and arrows for that age. Tips come off if they land in the gravel, but can be glued back on. We are pleased with the bow and the arrows. We ordered the Lil John Back Quiver, which is a better quiver than comes with the bow."
2,Arrows for youth bows,"The fiberglass shafts should be plenty durable, and are straight, but the field points were cheap-looking, The plastic fletchings were bent from being pressed against the package. The fletchings can be straightened by heating them with a blow-dryer and smoothing them out.I didn't try to shoot these with my bow, because it has a maximum 35 lb draw weight, and the arrows are printed on the shafts, ""MAXIMUM DRAW WEIGHT 30 LBS."" Don't take chances with safety; only buy these for very light draw weight bows.Probably okay for kids just learning to shoot, but they aren't a good dollar value at about $5 each."
4,Great for kids!,"I have 2 beginner bow hunters and these are the perfect arrows for them.We have had one set since Christmas and the only problem has been the tip coming off (which we just glued back on). The have not broken, they fly pretty decently, and they were fairly cheap. I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because they aren't sharp at all. This was a bonus in the beginning, but now that they are better shots, it would be nice if they were sharper."
2,Waste of money,"These are very pooly made arrows. The plastic fleching comes bent and never really gets strait which makes for very poor accuracy, so even if you're a new archer you won't learn much if your arrows are inconsistent. Also, the tips are very cheap and dent and fall off. I have also had a couple of nocks fall off."
3,Not really the correct size.,It really was not the correct size and the feathers came off really easy. So it broke fast on a compound bow.
3,Works ok...but cheap,Bought daughters each a new Bear archery titan bow for Christmas. Dreams of Katniss Everdean ran thru their heads. One of the tips of the arrows came off after about 2 shots. We were using an old cardboard box.
4,Great beginner arrow,These are pretty good quality arrows for beginner and for back yard target practicing..I've been to some sports store and looked at some arrows for the same price range and the quality is in the low end compare to these. I'm no expert to archery because I'm a beginner myself but I'm happy with these arrows so far.
1,Do not buy,"These arrows are cheaply made, and have a two dollar value, when I got them, one was already broken, and when I shot another arrow it snapped in half, another's tip dented when it hit a wall, and they have bad accuracy. The ends easily crack and the splinters are very sharp, and painful. The arrows also have a tendency to flip in mid air and go in an unwanted direction."
2,Notch broke the first day.,I bought this for my son and the notch broke the first time we shot it. I was very disappointed in the quality.
2,Good only for toy bows,"All I can say is, if you have an high performance compound bow, do NOT use these arrows. You might hurt yourself as you release the string. Mine arrows broke as I released the release. It was a good thing that the only thing that broke was the nocks' end."
1,inferior product,We bought these for my son to practice with. They are junk! Have shredded and crumbled. Never seen anything like it.
1,Disappointed,"First of all, the 'feathers' are plastic. Not too good for shooting accurately.Bottom line, I don't recommend buying archery supplies online. Better to go to a local archery shop and get help figuring out which products will suit your goals.Good news is that Amazon's return policy gave me most of my money back."
4,Nice arrows,"This is a good arrow, very accurate but be gentle. It is reasonably durable but the orange end where it contacts the string is a bit delicate. Don't shoot at hard surfaces and you will be fine. Common sense, really."
3,Arrow tips blunt very easily. Good for beginners.,"We had a straw hay target and some card board boxes surrounding the target in the basement. The tips, whether it was because our child bounced too many off the cement wall or off the cardboard boxes, all the tips went blunt. When we used a bow with less than 30 pounds, the arrows bounced off the straw target. When we used the 30 lb bow the blunt ends continued to work. They are good for a beginner. [Got to watch the duct work in the basement though.]"
4,Great for the kids bow,These are durable and easy to see. The are just what I was hoping for. They don't float though so be careful around water.
3,Good,Good not great. They worked really well for about 4 trips to the range and then one started to fall apart. I guess that is expected. I wish the points where sharper but they are beginner arrows and very blunt tips is safer. Good for beginners.
4,So far so good....,"My kids are new to Archery and needless to say were a bit off target with may of their shots to start in very cold weather. Their aim has gotten better and have had no issues with the quality or the beating these have been through so far. After reading some of the reviews I was a bit hesitant but was glad I made my purchase so far. Only issue that I could see are that the colors of the arrows are different than what is displayed, but if color is my only issue I am happy."
3,"For Kids, not adults","This is for kids, not for adults.I tried using those on my 55 lbs recurve, and it broke all three within a month. Just for kids. Go spend 20 bucks more for an adult size."
4,Perfect for its Purpose,"Purchased to go with a bow for our nephew's Christmas present. They look perfect, and we're sure he'll enjoy them!!!"
3,"Not horrible, but not good.","The arrows got here quickly, but one of them is already broken. The notch at the top literally snapped in half. It had only been shot twice, so I don't really see how that could happen unless there was something wrong with it. But, other than that, they're okay."
4,Another Great CD for on the Road,I love this man's music. I can't say enough about him. Take this CD on the road with you.
4,Robert Earl Delivers Again!,"Get on your horse and buy this CD as soon as you can! Robert Earl's latest is best described as a combination of all of his previous works but with a greater emphasis on the Texas sounds and stories we've grown to love. You'll hear a little more twang and a lot less Lo Mein, if you know what I mean."
2,Not what is shown in picture,I was expecting something remotely similar to the picture but they weren't at all what I thought. They don't stay up at all and the rhinestones(not shown in the pciture) were stuck to eachother and almost ripped the nylon apart completely I guess you get what you pay for here. NOTE: there is no lace and the rhinestones are supposed to be around the ankle and unless you 5' tall that is not the case here.
4,"A beautiful story, definitely worth reading.","Once again, Andrew Greeley has given his readers a sample of his finest work. This story, peppered with perfectly magical imagery of the Irish countryside, succeeds in capturing the true romance of Irish history. Greeley succeeds magnificently in his attempt to link truth and fiction as he explores the mystery of the Michael Collins murder.Follow Dermot Michael in his quest for the truth about his grandparents, and be swept away by the two parallel love stories which will leave any reader wishing the book would never end.A truely magical tale, this book is a treasure for any reader who is a romantic at heart."
5,"Excellent story, fascinating and ""real"" characters","This was my first introduction to Mr. Andrew M. Greeley and I was impressed. The characters leaped forth from the pages and became ""real."" I was equally impressed with the descriptions and background of Ireland and the history surrounding Michael Collins. Dermot is an intriguing and admirable character and how do you put into words all that Nuala Anne McGrail is? The best thing about it is that they live on in Irish Lace and Irish Whiskey. I am now three chapters into Irish Lace and feel like I have come home again."
5,Fr. Greely ROCKS!,"I am a huge fan of Fr. Andrew Greely. Love his descriptions of Ireland, and the history he brings into his stories. Fr.Greely makes God very approachable and proves He is always with us in all that we do. Last but not least...who can resist a good love story?"
3,"Nice, But Not An Easy Read","I eagerly looked forward to reading this book as I'm an avid reader and collector of natural hair care publications. Unfortunately, the book was printed in an uncommon font that did not permit me to fully enjoy the book. After reading blocks and blocks of paragraphs in this font, the words practically became indecipherable to me. I wondered why in the world would this author choose this font rather than Times Roman or some other standard font. It made the book's contents look amateurish. In summary, if you can get past the font, the book is a nice collection of keeping-it-real sisters sharing stories about transitioning to wearing natural hairstyles."
3,Matsubayashi Shorin-Ryu Redone,"This video starts with a brief history of Matsubayashi-Ryu Karate and a biography of the Grand Master. Which consist of stills that you will recall from various books. This tape seems Like an after thought. If you wish to listen to the history, this is the tape for you. The ""Collector's Edition Matsubayashi Shorin-Ryu"" by Masterline Vide is a superior tape. Though I will keep this in my library, of course.This tape is more of a history review. The kata's shown on this tape are only: Kusanku, Naihanci, Fukyugata Ichi, Gekisai Dai Ichi, Sai Dai Ichi and Pinan Shodan with some applications."
1,2nd incomplete tape,This tape is also incomplete and does not have an ending. I have notified Dragon Productions about the problem and they are investigating and said they are sending me a new tape to replace the one I have.
5,Can't Complain,another wonderful cd from Phoebe Snow. I can't say enough good about the duet with Michael McDonald. their voices blend so well together. Give us more Phoebe.
3,I can complain just a little,"As much as I love Phoebe Snow's voice (and song writing and guitar playing) she just seems to be trying to do too much on this record. One moment its solid pop such as the duet with Michael McDonald (Right to the end) and the next its labored blues such as Rockin Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu. Please! The real low point for me though is the speeded up take on Mitchell's Case of You. Diana Krall nailed this song on the TNT tribute to Mitchell but Snow's version is lame, lame.All in all, one of those records that a fan has to have but disappointing when you know the next one is going to be such a long time coming"
4,Super comfy but...,"These shoes are awesome for the most part. They look how I expected, they feel great, are true to size, incredibly comfortable and easy to get on and off. It's just that they're a little TOO easy to get off. I find that if I jog at all in them (I'm no runner, but if I just sprint to get from point A to point B), my heel slips out, so I don't recommend for anything other than casual wear. Otherwise they're great!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,I bought these shoes because they are vegan and also because I have a pair of Saucony shoes that I love. They are surprisingly comfortable. They are wide which works well for my foot. I walk to and from work (1 mile each way) and these shoes feel great. I am very pleased and would recommend them. The price was reasonable.
3,Love the style but a heavy shoe,These shoes have a great style but they are very heavy. They have held up very well but do not allow your feet to breath all that much.
4,Comfy and good for walk/runs,"I got these to wear when I'm doing my walk/run on a treadmill or working out on the eliptical at the gym. I have some serious running shoes I use on pavement but they are too hard for the treadmill and the gym in general. These were on sale and as they are vegan, I'm looking forward the them being easy to wash and care for (even if they won't last as long as leather shoes). They don't have a ton of support but they are light and have good cushioning. I am only running short distances so if you need something heavy duty these aren't for you. But if you want a comfy, light, all-around use sneaker I can't recommend this enough. Only reason I didn't give 5 starts is that I wish they did have a little more cushioning in the sole but if I decide I need it, I can use different insoles as these are removable. Love these so much I bought a second pair!"
3,Not like normal Saucony,"These shoes are different than normal low pro vegans. These are slip on and have thinner walls than the other ones and thin, elastic back. Seems like they are meant to be worn without socks? There are not laces, but elastic in the laces. I actually liked the design, kind of as a sneaker style alternative to Tom's shoes. The sizes also run a bit big. I am normally an 8.5 or 9 and the 9 was WAY too big on me.This shoe is listed as the same as the orange and grey ones (which I also ordered) but they are quite different. The orange and grey ones (which also cost more $) are more like the normal low pro's, but made out of different material. I really like the canvas/ vegan look of the vegan shoes, but this particular style seems a bit flimsy compared to the $54 ones.Can always buy then return.... which is what I am doing."
2,I love these shoes,"I love these shoes so much, it's a shame that after only a few wearings, my toe had started to make a hole in the top of the shoe. By the time I had worn it a handful of times, my big toe was peeking through the top of the shoe. It makes me so, so sad."
5,Animal and Human Liberation!,These shoes are a lot cuter in person and surprisingly comfortable. I also own running shoes by Saucony and I like these more! The Jazz is a whole lot lighter. I just started wearing these yesterday so not sure yet how long it will last but looks and feels sturdy. My boyfriend has the regular Low Pro Jazz and he was complimenting the fabric. These are easily my favorite shoes now.
3,InStep Run Around 2,"Just got the stroller - not really that much to talk about. The locking mechanism for folding/unfolding is a little difficult but other than that, it seems like a great deal for the money you pay."
4,Nice stroller for the price,"Comfy for the kids and seats recline so they can sleep. Places for storage. It's pretty lightweight, but wide and the front wheel does not swivel. Great for walks/jogging not shopping. Takes up a lot of room in the car."
3,No basket!,"I bought this stroller through this link 7/27/11, received it 8/01/11, built it 8/01/11 and ran with it 8/02/11. The jogger is okay (it's not a BOB), but THEY DISCONTINUED THE UNDER-CARRIAGE BASKET for model #11-KS228 which is what I received purchasing from this link. For those moms who want to carry a couple of diapers, sunscreen, sand toys, towels, hats, extra shirts, etc., this is a serious inconvenience. It has storage compartments behind each seat and a little parent console at the handle bar, and for those who don't haul much, that will suffice. I go on longer, farther runs, and my kids need entertainment (park or beach) midway with snacks, so I need more space. The customer service rep at Pacific Cycle (800-242-6110)told me to google for some retailers who might still have one, but they discontinued it so they can't even let me buy one. Thank goodness my mother sews so she made me a basket."
2,Not for tall kids,"I bought this not doing all my research and when we got it, my 2 going on 3yr old's head was passing the top of the seat. I did find out that all InStep strollers can fit kids 38in and below comfortably. I didn't have a chance to give a test run. It seemed nice other than my boy is too tall (and I don't think he's that tall anyway)for it. So it has been sent back."
3,Great... just one complaint (it's kind of a biggie),"This jogger is great for many reasons. It has excellent storage, including several different compartments. It holds up to 100lbs, and it's roomy enough for my almost five year old (she's only 35 pounds)to fit in it just fine. It is also extremely comfortable for my 6 month old son.My one complaint is that the front wheel doesn't swivel. I didn't realize that when I bought it. If you jog in an area where you are turning corners, it's kind of a pain because you have to pivot it around on the back wheels.So, if ease of movement around a city block is important to you, don't get this stroller! I have to say though, for $140 (on sale), it's a pretty good buy!"
1,Low Quality!,"When I first recieved the stroller, it seemed to be okay for the price. It was fairly easy to put together. However, when I got the tires inflated, one of the inner tubes was warped, and the other randomly popped while I was walking down a fairly smooth street. The front tire will not stay in place and the straps in the seats are hard to adjust. I would not recommend this stroller."
4,Well worth the price!,"I bought this stroller back in December 2007 and the price has gone up considerably. It arrived w/the wrong size front wheel, so I called the manufacturer and they sent me the correct size. I have two boys, 2 and 4, so only need a double for a year or so until we go over the wt. limit. For the price I think this one will be perfect. It's not fancy, but was fairly simple to put together and seems quite durable and easy to manuever."
5,Beautifully simple,"Don't listen to the nay-sayers! This is an incredible album that shows a different, truly lovely side of Colvin. It is especially touching to remember that she put this album together when she was pregnant with her first child. When you listen with that in mind, her heartfelt renditions of these gentle songs seem all the more sweet. Children and adults alike will love to listen to this cd that became an instant holiday favorite in my house."
2,Not Up to Par!,"I just love everything Ms. Colvin has published to date, but this latest issue is a real lightweight compared to the others. Perhaps it was thrown together to cash in on her popularity. It's adequate but not the Shawn I'm used to."
2,Ranks at the bottom of my list of her work,"Not so good. Great concept for the CD, but a total wash at follow through. Left me flat. It will be dust collecter or will find its way to the used cd store."
3,A for Attempt + F for Failure = C for Christmas Spirit,"The problem with this recordingis that a unique vocalistattempts a style that is nother own and it sounds like it.I personally know several womenwho are not professional musicianswho could have done a better jobon this set of arrangements.She might have succeededhad she arranged the songsto accommodate her styleas most vocalists do whenattempting to performtraditional music.The final result is not good as music,but she gets much due credit foran act of love with God, her parentsand her unborn child as its object.Objectively speaking it may be her finestrecording in the spiritual sense,but certainly not in the artistic sense.I'm glad she did it even thoughI don't care to listen to it againand I'm guessing Ms. Colvinis glad she did it to.I'll bet baby Colvin loves it.What else matters?"
1,not a stocking stuffer for dyed in the wool fans,"i have been a big fan of shawn colvin for years, but this album was a diappointment. Her very distinctive, at times gravelly voice, are out of sync with most of the selections. it was painful listening to her version of the vince guaraldi-mendelson classic Christmas time is here."
2,I've tried so hard to like it,"About once a year, I get this CD out and try once more. I love Christmas music, lullabies, and Shawn Colvin, but this album just doesn't work for me.I think it's because she doesn't really do anything new or interesting with the music and her voice sounds (IMHO) *too* bare and stripped down--like a 12-year-old girl singing Christmas music to herself. I got bored/frustrated with track after indifferent-sounding track. This one's going to the Goodwill this year.For what it's worth, I have three other Shawn Colvin albums and love songs like ""Shotgun Down the Avalanche"" and ""Round of Blues"". I just think the girlish lilt and untrained nature of her voice seem to work better with her own compositions."
2,Disapointment from Heavy User,"I was very disapointed when I started ironing and every item I ironed left starch flakes all over. I could tell the plate never would get very hot (I had it on the hottest setting). Cleaning each piece after ironing was not worth it, this is supposed to be one of their upper line irons though my old $20 B&D beat this model. Don't think I'll buy another Rowenta."
3,"good for general info, double check tech specs","this book was a little disappointing. i thought clymer was the authority on bike repair and maintenance.its good for general purpose info but i found it contradicts my owners manual on many specs.i have a 2001 cb 250 nighthawk, so far i found its wrong on fuel capacity, oil capacity, plug gap, and valve clearance."
4,TRUE ORIGINALITY,"A GREAT CD, ANY FAN OF EITHER COUNT BASIE OR OSCAR PETERSON WILL ENJOY IT. I REMEMBER WHEN ALL OF THESE ALBUMS ON THE PABLO LABEL CAME OUT IN THE EARLY 70'S, THEY WERE A LOT OF FUN AND THEY STILL ARE TODAY. THE COUNT DOES SOME MEAN ORGAN PLAYING ON THIS CD TO COMPLEMENT OSCAR PETERSON (NOT SURPRISING SINCE HE PLAYED THE ORGAN IN MOVIE HOUSES FOR SILENT PICTURES BEFORE HE HOOKED UP WITH THE BENNY MOTEN BAND)"
3,Some issues,"Overall, this book is quite good. I teach college German, and I picked it up as a refresher. I also lived for a number of years in Germany. I just have a couple of issues with translations in this book. The word ""slum"" is translated ""Baracke"". But Baracke really means a shack or hut, not a ghetto or slum. The word for slum in German is der Slum, or das Elendsviertel. I am just wondering about the other translations at this point."
3,Just not my favorite Stereolab Album,"This is the fifth Stereolab Album I have purchased and, unfortunately, it is my least favorite. I first heard Stereolab on the Margerine Eclipse Album and I think I was spoiled by the how well songs were crafted and produced on that album. I would never suggest you not buy this album but I wouldn't suggest that it be your first."
1,A poorly written text,"Studying this Crosswind text, I have been consistently surprised at both the cut and paste quality of the edit and the remarkably poor language skills shown throughout. Before inflicting their next effort upon the Project Management public, Messrs Johnson et al might consider some remedial instruction in the construction of the English sentence. Such grammar would not be so bad if it did not confuse the already semantic-laden arguments of the PMI; however, it does, and does so consistently. Finally, I must agree with the set of reviewers that suspect cheating on the part of Crosswind through implantation of glowingly positive reviews. Comparing descriptions with the actual text, clearly the author(s) of such critiques are either the text's authors themselves, or have not actually read the volume."
3,Other material needed to pass exam,"I took the 5 day bootcamp class. The training facility/instructor used this book along with PMBOK but more as a reference. The book is definitely a better read than PMBOK (what book isn't!) but in terms of only using the Tony book for studying for the test, I would disagree 100%. I don't know how some passed with only using this book. I guess everyone learns differently. The test is very tough in my opinion. Very tricky in terms of wording to say the least. The CD is helpful for basic familarization but the test questions are not ANYWHERE close to the real questions on the exam. Beware! I have done tons of research and there are much better authors who created test questions much more similar to the exam."
5,Success story,"Almost all the chapters were extremely helpful. I liked the framework fill in the blank exercise, 30 questions at the end of each chapters and the matching input, tool, output exercise. The chapter that explained how to apply for the PMP exam was really helpful. I did most of my studying using this book in addition to PMBOK. I passed the PMP exam yesterday."
2,Not a good book for actual Exam,"This book is good for understanding concepts but actual exam is MORE difficult than sample questions provided in this book and CD. I could answer 100% of all questions in this book but in actual exam, I could get only 67%(New PMP Exam). Also, language used for questions in this book is very simple compare to actual exam questions.Conclusion, do not rely ONLY on this book to pass exam."
1,Heaps of fake reviews here!,"Checking on some of these reviewers they're obviously fake (reviewing only Tony Johnson books, giving them all 5 stars with overly glowing reviews!!!). Probably quite common on Amazon but for that I'm gonna steer clear of these books. Don't like being duped..."
3,Not sure how much this book helped,"I did pass the PMP exam on the first try, but I am not sure how much this book helped. Mostly I relied on the test CD and chapter tests as study diagnostics. They became too repetitive after a while. I can't compare it with the other major prep guides out there, since I didn't use them. My suggestion would be 1) have project experience 2) get the PMBOK 3) Create a study plan, or a project plan(!) 4) Schedule the exam to prevent procrastination 5) Get studying."
1,Worst material for PMP - very bad prep,This is probably the worst material that I had read for PMP exam. All of them are simple questions that you can get it from PMPBOK book. More than 50% are repeated questions in the software.
5,Very clean & easy to read +++,"Besides the PMBOK, this was the only other book that I purchased. I started reading the PMBOK first but I had a hard time memorizing concepts, tables, formulas, processes, etc. Don't get me wrong, the PMBOK is a great resource, but in my opinion is a little tedious to read, so I decided to change my studying strategy. I started reading the PMP Success Series first and using the PMBOK as a complimentary resource. This combination worked great for me! The advantage of this book is that it has a bunch of tools, tables, exercises, and of course the CD, that helped me to memorize needed things for the test. I strongly would recommend this book to anyone trying to prepare for the PMP certification."
5,A Must for Assessment Writing,"Since this is the same book our state Department of Education consults when writing our end-of-course assessments, I wanted the same tool when creating our Division-created assessments in social studies. Vocabulary, especially content-specific terms, is a gateway to advanced learning. The book is easy to navigate and allowed me to make solid judgements on whether or not to use particular words on my assessments."
4,Great resource,"Very useful. Words are organized by grade level, subject, and alphabetically, so it's really easy to find the word you're looking for. I only gave 4 stars, because I sometimes run into issues with words with multiple meanings (like ""plane"" for example... is it an airplane or a flat surface?), and pluralizing/conjugating words. I use this to write for younger grade levels, but I'm not formally trained in education. I would have appreciated some guidelines on how to deal with the issues listed above."
3,Love the cumulative list--but is the grading info dated?,"The cumulative list is wonderful (though I wish it was available for purchase electronically). But considering the publication date--and they haven't published a newer version--I wonder how accurately it reflects the words that students are actually learning in each grade now? My clients still rely on this publication, but I think they should find a more up-to-date guideline for grade-appropriate words."
1,"Edl Core Vocabularies In Reading, Mathematics, Science, And Social Studies","Useless. This is a list of words with no definitions. Students and those who wish to expand their vocabulary will be dissappointed when they realize they have to look up all definitions. Reading a dictionary would take less time.Edl Core Vocabularies In Reading, Mathematics, Science, And Social Studies"
4,"loved the quality, but.....","this was a gift but received wrong size and had to return, but the quality of slipper was good."

5,Favorite book from my childhood,"This was my favorite book when I read it when I was about 11. It was the first book that kept me awake all night long! And then in my many moves and two fires, I lost my copy, and I was sooo sad, because it is one of those books that I have always liked to revisit! but yeah for me, I was able to secure another copy, and I just reread it! and this copy will be kept much much safer!"
5,Very Good,"A cople years ago I read one of Ellen Emereson White's books, ever since then I've read every one of her books I can find. I found this book at my libary and well reading it I liked it alot but it wasn't till I finished the book and thought about what happend did I realy enjoy this book. I didn't like the second one as much and haven't found first one yet but if it half as good this book it's worth wait."
2,A total disappointment,"I read this book when I was an 8th grader, and checked it out from the library week after week. I was so excited to see it rereleased, and I cannot believe it was revamped to appeal to a younger generation. References to current TV shows and movies were totally unnecessary, the book stood fine on its own. I really wish they had left this as is. If you haven't read the 1989 version of this book, you'll be just fine. If you're looking for a bit of nostalgic reading, prepare to be incredibly disappointed."
5,AWESOME BOOK---REPRINT IT!!!!,"I absolutly love this book. My sister checked it out, and I picked it up without reading the other 2 in the series and I could NOT put it down!! I've long since read the other 2 and I've checked out the book sooo many times from our local library that I think they should just give it to me! It is my favorite book, and I want to buy a copy. Please Scholastic, reprint it!!"
5,We need a second edition of this book!,"Any one who has read this book will agree, it needs to go to print again! Meghan Powers battles a kidnapper and personal demons in this stay-up-all-night-to-finish book. Kidnapped by a psychopath to manipulate her mother (the President!), Meg has to discover herself before she can find her way to freedom. A stark look at the emotions of people under duress. Meg serves as a real person when most books focus on too-perfect people. The book has real emotions, real feelings, and real reactions. This nail biter will have you laughing, crying, and cheering. Ellen Emerson White (also known as Zack Emerson) really captures the emotions of a young adult struggling to live her life while the world watches. Scholastic-Reprint this book!"
5,All the Good Stuff,"Some people would dismiss Tony &co.; as an example of 70s kitsch. In a way, it is and the appeal of this may jut be nostalgia for us who were there at the time and enjoyed their television show as children.But overall, this stuff goes down quite smoothly. Most of the well-remembered tunes are here,""Candida,"" ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon,"" ""Knock 3 Times,"" etc. But if you were there at the time, you'll really appreciate the rarities such as ""Steppin Out (Gonna Boogie Tonight),"" (to this day, I hum this whenever I'm about to go on a date) and the lovely ""Morning Beautiful. "" BTW-the album cover comes from a segment on their TV show where they performed the latter tune.What would people born after 1980 make of this? I have no idea. But for those of us who were there, it is mighty sweet."
3,Good Remastered Recording,"I saw this group live when the Candida album was released. I don't remember any reference to Tony Orlando at that time and he wasn't given credit as the lead singer .. so what gives??I thoroughly enjoyed this compilation. It has the big hits, plus some standards that in themselves at this time are stadards in their own right, e.g. Tie a yellow Ribbon. Also a couple I had never heard before that have a country twist. A good buy for someone looking at music in this period."
4,Good stuff,"Do you know anything about Tony's days in or about 1969 when he had a single called ""Make Believe"" via the name ""Wind""??"
1,This book is dreadful,"The names are bizarre and the tally is ridiculous. They consider ""Ceejay"" a name, short for C.J. Enough said."
2,Full of mistakes and out of touch,"I have to echo the earlier reviewer about this book's treatment of names from different cultures. The author proudly proclaims that he's broadened his cultural reach with this book, with new suggestions for Spanish names -- Sierra and Nevada!! -- and French names -- Brie and Chardonnay!!! It seems that his cultural research didn't extend past the contents of his refrigerator."
4,It was a good past time,"although i am not a parent, but i bought this book to gift to some one. curiosity kills. i went through the book, and found that it had some very great names. however picking a name was quite difficult. the book is a very good effort and it should be appreciated.it is more like an encyclopedia of names. in shortI LOVED IT."
5,highly abstract -- and excellent,"from the producer of the famed l.a. underground hip-hop compilation 'beneath the surface,' omid's 'distant drummer' is a wonderfully unique and essentially instrumental album (the lovely track 'ways of the world' features vocalist nikko).unforseen textures and colors flow easily together in this album -- los angeles deterritorialized by the invisible forces of the earth and cosmos."
4,Unique and Fresh,"I enjoyed paging through it. I kept landing on the toilet stories. I have a few good ones too. The meat of the book is the reality check, good information for travelers. The cultural information is an added bonus that gave me an idea of behavior and what to expect. I've been to about half of the desitnations mentioned. I want to make it to the other half. Now I have some info to go on. Great read!"
4,This is great!,This book is super-practical and an absolute must for college grads and those who may have been out of the Interview process for a while.This book is acually used by large company recruiters who ask the EXACT same questions as contained within the text.....there's no reason to be unprepared anymore!
3,Marketing in Marketing Terms,"Idris Mootee is a marketing scholar who talks about marketing in marketing terms. He brings up many good points about how marketing is shifting from product, placement, price, and promotion to participation, personalizaton, peer to peer communication and predictive modeling.To me a good marketing book emulates its own story. In my opinion this book fails to do that. I also failed to envision many of the business ideas as I work independantly. If you are into the technical side of marketing this is a great book for you. I tend to be more interested in books like those written by Seth Godin and Malcolm Gladwell though. If you view Seth Godin as fluffery than this is probably going to be a great book for you. Their writing styles are polar opposites in my eyes."
4,Very good,"The dealer did not have the ring I ordered, but they are very helpful and they did their best to satisfy my request."
2,Daft Club all over again...,"As we learned when Daft Club came out, listening to other artists remix Daft Punk songs reminds you how wonderful Daft Punk are. None of these artists are at all bad, I'm a fan of most of their regualr work. However the only good remix on this album is the final track, Robot Rock as remixed by none other than Daft Punk themselves! If Daft Punk put out a remix album where they did all the remixes it'd be phenomenal. Until then, dont waste your money. This album gets 2 stars for the remix of Robot Rock; I'd have given the album 1 star if the track was not on it."
4,This Is The One,"It seems that I may be among the minority that found this one to be better than the first. This one does rock harder and does have a tendency to take wild rides that may clash at times with the main melody, but isn't that what rock is all about? It never gets boring. I would recommend this one to anybody for the first track alone. Steve Lukather proves himself as a master of the fretboard with his rendition of The Christmas Song. I am a fan of the production on this one as well. Another success for Vai. Pour some eggnog, turn your stereo up to 11 and enjoy the ride!"
3,"metal drone, no blues players, still no singing","Predominant metal drone, head-bashing. Where are the blues, jazz players? Love Lukather, Stevens jiggy thangs. Hamm -- yes, more bass players! Too much guitar -- still disappointed Prodcuer Vai won't let the guys sing, use guitar for punctuation. Prefer volume 1.thibon feesh"
5,Marvelous renditions of well known compositions,"When I reviewed the track titles I was hesitant in purchasing ""Buried Treasures"" as I already owned several renditions of several tracks. However, let me encourage you to buy this recording. There is an excellent ""concert"" atmosphere and Brubeck and Desmond are in excellent form - especially on St Louis; Take Five and Broadway. These tracks especially contain the essence and brilliance of the Brubeck Quartet."
5,The classis Brubeck Quartet: Still great near the end,"At the time of this concert, the classic Brubeck Quartet--Brubeck, Desmond, Morello, Wright--was nearing the end of their playing together and Brubeck/Desmond were about to become ""The Dave Brubeck Trio with Gerry Mulligan."" The quality of this recording is excellent and the Spanish introduction is fun. While I enjoy Brubeck uncritically, several of these tracks sound fresh and creative to me. Quite a feat for Brubeck/Desmond after playing together for at least 17 years!"
3,Ecxcellent compilation!,"I recommend this CD compilation because it is not the typical pop/seventies you expect to hear everyday on a typical radio station. Tracks like ""Undercover Angel"" by Alan O'Day, ""You Made Me Believe In Magic"" by Bay City Rollers, ""Thunder Island"" by Jay Ferguson & ""So Into You"" by Atlantic Rhythm Section are truly new gems for your collection. I recommend you get a copy before it goes out of print!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this CD because of the tune ""Thunder Island"" - when this song came out, drum machines were not the norm. I immediately forwarded to Thunder Island and was shocked that not only was the singer not Jay Ferguson, but it had a drum machine playing the track! The other tunes are cover bands as well. What a waste and a scam!"
5,James Hetley .... more please!,He takes truth and sews it together with mysticism and fantasy in a thoroughly enchanting way.
5,Almost There,"My wife and I separated after 12 years of marriage and it did not look good. I was not a Christian. I was staying with my parents when I first heard the song ""I can only Imagine"" on a soft rock station. I was a broken man. My life was falling apart. I was in tears by the end of this song. That was the night I gave myself to Jesus. This CD reminds me that wonderful day. I say it is a wonderful day, because I found Jesus and I turned my life around. My wife and I worked out our differences and I finally admitted to my faults. I always feel that this CD was what helped me become a believer in Christ. It gave me the nudge that I needed. The music is wonderful. The songs are joy to hear. The title is fitting to where I was in my life at that time: ""Almost There""."
5,Absolutely Fabulous,"The music and lyrics to this CD are both wonderful. Even when it comes to contempoary Christian music my 17-year-old son doesn't often have the same tastes as his mom, but this is one that we definitely agree on. Our personal favorite is ""I Can Only Imagine"". We have listened to it so many times and yet it still brings tears to the eyes and a quiet sense of awe and wonder."
5,"Mercy Me, what a CD!","I too was immediately enchanted with ""I Can Only Imagine"". I had not even heard of the group Mercy Me, but that song was enough to send me on a mission to find the CD, which turned out not to be an easy task. I had to go to three stores before finding it, but it was well worth the trouble. The whole CD is awesome, but ""I Can Only Imagine"" is still my fave, with ""Bless Me Indeed"" coming in second. Don't miss this one!!!"
4,Great New Worship Sound,"If you enjoy the worship of the new sounds in Christian music, you will like this CD. There is more to this CD than the unmistakable great song ""Only Imagine"". Parents, this is one that you will approve. Great new sound from a Dallas Christian Band."
5,Awesome!!,"I love this CD. And what makes it even better is that they are young men for God. My boys love to listen to it... so I even ordered another one for them. Of course my favorite song is, I Can Only Imagine! What a wonderful song and them singing it, makes it even better. Buy it, you will not regret it!"
4,"worth it for just one song, but there's plenty more...","I had to have this album after hearing the song, ""I Can Only Imagine"" and the background behind why the song was written. The author's father died when the author was 19. For years, the author scribbled the line ""I can only imagine"" doodling on paper with his mind wandering. The night before this album was to be recorded, the author completed writing this song and it was recorded without much edit.The song is about what happens when you die. It speculates on what you would think, what you would do when you have the pleasure of meeting Jesus. When I think of how this relates to my father, who passed away when I was a teenager, it brings tears to my eyes. However, it makes me very happy to picture my father meeting Jesus. It's a beautiful song and a great CD to buy today!"
5,Simply Amazing,"The song ""I Can Only Imagine"" makes this CD worth buying. I also heard it at two different movie theaters (which I think is incredible that a worship song is getting this type of attention). I dont have very much new to say about the cd that has not already been said but I wanted to give this CD 5 stars and be a supporter of how great it is."
5,TRULY SPECIAL,"I recently wrote a 3-star review of MercyMe's second album Spoken For which I believe does not live up to the quality of this CD. In comparison, this album offers songs that are memorable both musically and spiritually. My favorites include I Worship You, How Great Is Your Love and, of course, I Can Only Imagine. As you'll read in previous reviews, this is a special CD from a gifted band and I would strongly encourage you to purchase it."
5,Awesome,This album was the first christian purchase for me 10 yrs ago. Had to dl it to my phoneso now it is always with me.Its amazing how the LORD lets us know what we need.
5,Blessed Indeed,"Mercy Me appears to be a band that's going to be around awhile. Once the current hit ""I can Only Imagine"" runs it's course, a number of the other songs will get their opportunity to Bless Us Indeed ( tract # 7-Bless Me Indeed) and climb the charts.Bart Millard, the lead singer, wrote or CO-wrote 10 of the CD's 12 songs. I can Only Imagine is a smash hit that Bart wrote himself. We will most likely see his work or collaborative efforts with other artist and Mercy Me in the future.Mercy Me is seems to have a down to earth sound that's gives me the impression that ""I can sing with these Guys"". The music is touching and imaginatively descriptive. I can experience the music and the presence of God when listening to it.You can't go wrong with this CD. The lyrical content certainly transcends the like dislike argument of competing generations. There is something here for everyone..."
5,Outstanding Christian Music,Music to make you feel really close to the Lord! Worship the Lord while singing!
3,"It was okay, but not what I was hoping for","This CD was okay, but wasn't great. I was listening to a lot of the Newsboys' music before I was given this CD. So maybe my expectations of Mercyme were a little high. Some of these songs were great, but on others it seemed that they were trying too hard to write a good song. No offense, but I don't really like the singers voice. It was kinda scratchy on a few songs. To be honest, I didn't exactly fall in love with this CD right away. It was one of those CD's that had to grow on me. When I first heard I Can Only Imagine, I truly liked it. But they've played it constantly on the radio, that I don't really like it anymore. This CD is pretty good, and eventually I think that I really will fall in live with it."
2,"Amy Grant's version of ""Imagine"" is better","I am only rating the song ""Imagine"" since I haven't listened to the rest of this CD. I don't care for MercyMe's version of ""Imagine,"" despite the fact that they wrote it. They have too much of a country ""twang"" for my taste. I think Amy Grant's version of the song is more vocally interesting (versus flat and boring) and her vocal maturity shines....plus she changed some of the lyrics and her touches make all the difference. Check it out on her ""Legacy Hymns and Faith"" album."
2,what's the deal?,"""I Can Only Imagine""....yeah, it's uplifting, and it gives some people that ""feeling"". It's not that great of a song. In fact, it's nothing spectacular. It's not just that I'm sick of it(which I am). never ""got it""."
4,I really enjoyed this album,"I think this disk holds one the greatest Christian songs to get played on secular radio, and for that I commend MercyMe, and this album.However I have become a touch tired of the repitition, but I absolutely love some of the lesser played songs on this disk, for this I would recommend buying it, and give it 4 stars!"
1,Pitiful,I can imagine alot of re-borns swooning over this piece of trash as they faint while gibbering incomprehensible garblings.
1,Barf.,"I heard ""I Can Only Imagine"" on a mainstream radio station and called to request them NOT to play it. I used to listen to CCM, and this is up there with the cheesiest of that ilk, like ""Freinds"" and ""Butterfly Kisses"". Total, sappy drivel!"
5,Amazing,"The CD is worth buying for ""I can only imagine"" alone but every song on the CD is awesome. A must have."
5,It is already THERE! Great music,"I heard the song ""I can only imagine"" and cried as I thought of my Mom who recently passed away and that day when out and bought it as it was such a beautiful song. Well, I'm still loving it and all the rest of the songs. Well worth the $$$ and I'm looking more of their music."
3,Very Good Book That Tells Only Half the Story,"Through LTC John Paul Vann, Mr. Sheehan tells the story of the Vietnam War, particularly as it relates to the United States. He does an excellent job of recounting the events leading up to the war in Vann's life and the prior history of Vietnam.Unfortunately, the book is HIGHLY biased. Sheehan goes to great lengths to condemn the actions of the United States and South Vietnam. The pages ooze with tales of incompetence, corruption and evil intentions of the West. However, the evils of the Communists are usually not mentioned or are glossed over. As an example, Sheehan dismisses the North Vietnamese massacre (about 10,000 dead)of whole villages in 1956 as part of an agrarian reform plan as ""an unfortunate mistake"".I would recommend this book. However, readers should remember Mr. Sheehan is not neutral on matters."
5,Best piece of non-fiction that I've read so far,"I feel compelled to say that this work is by far the best piece of non-fiction that I have yet to read. It is two stories, that of John Paul Vann and the Vietnam war. Both are compelling and devastating at the same time. I wish I had the skill to write a more detailed review as others before me have done so well. Neil Sheehan has done a masterful job of interweaving these two stories together to create an unforgettable book. I will conclude this short review by urging all who have even the slightest of interest in the Vietnam war to give this book a go. You will not be disappointed."
5,I`vw read other books but none as detailed and informative!,"I found that this story and the history of Viet Nam are very detailed with information, that til Iread this book, did not know about. The wars in Viet Nam need never been fought. All that was needed, was for larger nations to listen to smaller nations. Their resolve, desire, need, for independence. I learned that good intentions don`t always end with good results!"
1,The Media Spins Viet Nam,"Neil Sheehan, was a writer for UPI,and then The New York Times, he was also a self described friend of John Paul Vann. He is of course as fair and unbiased in his treatment of Vann, and the war as all the other reporters. Sheehan did an impressive job with research and facts, especially in screening facts, drawing wrong conclusions, and spinning what was happening. Sheehan was caught-up in conventional wisdom of the war. He also delights in exploring Vann's shortcomings, something everyones friends loves to do. I meet and talked to John Paul Vann in 1969 and 1970, and I doubt that Sheehan spent much time discussing his shortcomings and delusions with him. I also doubt this book would have been published if Vann had not been Killed, and unable to state his opinions. Instead his friend shows how deluded warped and wrong Vann really was, I am not sure he would agree with Sheehan's opinions."
3,Tell Us Something We Don't Know,"I read this book a few years ago and the only significant thing I can remember clearly is the way John Paul Vann dies. That's because the author's bitterness toward the military colors everything he says. Endless criticism of military officers. But little criticism of the Presidents who ordered those officers to do what they were doing and say what they were saying. In fact, in the author's mind it was the Generals running the show and poor Kennedy and McNamaara and Johnson were their puppets. Isn't it nice to have a scapegoat to yell about when your political heroes have dragged the country into a 10-year nightmare?"
2,a small truth,"As Douglas Pike, perhaps the greatest American authority on the Vietcong, put it: Very good biography; very poor history."
1,Total cannot be serious.....,"WHACK!!! These ladies DEFINITELY can't be serious!!! They know they needed more time in the studio. I am so dissappointed in Puffy that I don't know what to do. Personally, I want a refund--in other words, it didn't deserve my 14 duckets."
1,If I could go back in time...,"...I would've put this album back on the rack where I found it (a.k.a. not purchase it). This album is so derivative and on top of that it's boring to listen to. The beats are sterile and lifeless. Puffy doesn't help matters either. Needless to say, I do not recommend this album."
2,Total is really TRIPPIN,"If you like the song ""Trippin"" go buy the single! Please don't think the rest of this album is going to sound as good as the first single. Total is extra nasty on this album and it is played out. I love Bad Boy. ""Room 112"" and ""Keep the Faith"" is good but ""Kima, Keisha, and Pam,"" really could have used moretime in the studio."
5,GREAT DEAL,"I RECEIVED CD WAY BEFORE TIME. THE QUALITY IS GREAT, THERE ARE NO SCRATCHES AND IT HAD IT'S ORIGINAL CASE."
1,Whack,These chicks are whack and their music is too. I know people who know them and said that they can't sing for $@*& and all of them especially the one with the long hair give it up real easy. There thing things are loose. There music is corny!!!!!!
3,Bad Boy production team should of produced most of the album,"Everybody just think for a moment, do you remember Total's first album. That was a tight CD and it should of went platinum instead of gold and it should of recieve more recognition than it did. Total's new is no way good as the first one. Tracks like ""I Tried"",""What About Us""(REMIX),and ""The Most Beautiful..."" and a few others threw this album of course. I hate to say it, but I don't blame Total for this, I blame Missy Elliott because the production on this album compare to Nicole's album looks like Missy just use leftover material that she stored away. The only song I like is track 1,3,5,6,7,10,17,18. To all the Total fans there the album isn't that bad, but could of been better. I know there next album will be good as the first one."
4,"this group is sexy,and it is just a great album",THEY ALL ARE WILD AND SEXY. THEY ARE JUST SO ORIGINAL THEN ALL OF THE OTHER GIRL GROUPS.
3,Too Much Missy,I think that there was way too much Missy Elliott on this album. She can produce some original beats but she can be quite inconsistent as evidenced by this album. Her beats get old too. I don't know why they didn't stick to their old formula with the first album where Puffy did most of the album. That album's a classic and this one simply isn't. Sitting Home and Rain are 2 standout tracks that show how talented Total is but the rest is mediocre and Trippin' is only okay. I expected more.
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"from previous works,i've been a fan.i liked ""Trippin"" and decided to buy the album since i was positive that there must be more songs there that i would love.NOT.the only songs i like are tracks 1,5 and i like the original instead of the remix of ""what about us"". anyhow, next time i know that when i like a song, buy the single,only!"
1,Awful!,"Don't be fooled by the single 'Trippin'. This album is definitely a no no. No depth, No flavor No... nothing! What happened?"
1,THE WORST ALBUM OF MY COLLECTION,"This is the worst album I ever bought, I'm so sorry. The only oustanding cut is What About Us."
4,Roll down the window........,"The album was overall good, the best songs are 1,2,7 and 11 (the best). I still haven't listen to the whole album yet(i had it for the longest) all i needed was those 25 seconds intro plays to find the hottest songs. If you buy the album, roll down your window for those 4 songs listed and any you think are hot."
2,quite a let down,"I kept hearing all sorts of good things about this CD and I was so excited when I bought it.I got home and opened it,listened to it and was so mad that I wasted my money on it.There were probably 3 good tracks off the whole CD.Most the songs had horrid beats.Most of the songs were very badly written.I would not recamend this CD to anyone who has some music taste.The only good tracks on this CD are ""Trippin"",""Sittin Home"",and""I Don't Wanna Smile"".A must avoid!"
4,Anyone remember Colorforms (tm),"I avoided this book for some time. I wasn't interested in anything with ""stickers"" for my young son. (I could just see them being attached to the wood furniture.) At some point we ended up with the book. I was shocked that the ""stickers"" were actually ""colorforms"", something that I had been looking for. The ""stickers"" are made of a thin plastic with the pictures printed on them. The ""pages"" of the book are made of a stiff board material.Ironically I was looking for colorforms for my son. When I inquired at the local toy stores they all told me that Colorforms were no longer in production. <sigh>"
2,Maybe Later???,"My four year old space nut was not interested in this book. We lost some of the colorforms too. :( I thought it was great, but he doesn't enjoy it. Not enough action maybe? I'm hoping he'll like it when he's a little older........"
5,Star Trek,Very good book. I have all the other books. It is always a pleasure to read William Shatner books. Recommend to all Trekkies.
4,enjoying...,I love the anime series and bought both Gungrave video games. I'm a casual gamer who likes it simple and to the point this game is good by my standards.
3,Could of been better.,"Gungrave Overdose is prime example of how a game can be flawed but good at the same time. Good story and cutscenes with marred gameplay. The story I was kind of surprised it was as good as it was. The gameplay is extremely repetitive as was the first and what hampers it is the camera when you get hit can go off balance and make it hard in some instances. The game is ultimately pretty easy until you get to the last boss battle which is not so much hard but it is highly annoying. Sound wise its on par what you would expect. Graphically nothing to special here and is one of the weakest spots in the game and I feel the original looked more detailed.Pros - cool art style,good story,awesome cutscenes, highly fun at timesCons - at time the camera system fails, the targeting sucks, overall feels rushed and unpolished,extremely repetitive, poor level design"
4,Great toy!,Fun to play with but like any other toy kids lose interest fast! It is not built to last forever but is very typical!
3,Hand held flash meter,"Nice meter, but the features on the new cameras make this item not so much. I haven't used it 5 times since I bought it."
4,Excellent but too short,"I thought this book was fantastic...basically a lighter ""On the Road"" for the ski set, rife with the kind of shenanigans you always wish you could get yourself into. Any self respecting skier (and snowboarders, too) should read this just to be considered a well rounded individual.HOWEVER it should be noted that the book is deceptively thick (very thick pages) and you'll finish reading it waaaay before you're ready for it to end. I suppose it would make good bathroom reading, since it's mostly composed of short anecdotes. All in all a wonderful read, but it really leaves you wanting more. A LOT more."
4,Brings Back Memories,I was a huge Tucker fan back in the 70's and 80's and this CD brings back some great memories of how great they were. Toy Caldwell (who passed away in 1993)was the driving force musically behind the band and his guitar work is in fine form on this disc. Anyone who was a fan should have this CD in their collection.
4,Just buy it,If you are a Marshall Tucker fan and a live fan just buy it. You won't waste your money. It's my favorite CD to play in the car. Especially on a road trip. This my first review. The album deserves it.
3,Good but not the Best,"I recorded this show, which was aired on WLIR FM NY, as part of the king biscuit flower hour broadcast. They actually played two shows at Nassau, April 18 and April 20. These CD's are OK, but the recorded tapes from the broadcast are way better, with respect to the sound and audience...I don't know what they did during the mixing, but much of the ""crowd feel"" has been cut out. I did buy the CD's because my original tapes are missing the last two songs, because I used only one TDK SA 90 tape.. Overall, a must have, but sound a little dissapointing. I did go to the April 20 show, which was the last show with Tommy C."
2,"Not At Their Peak, But Priceless Nonetheless","Being a long-time fan of the ORIGINAL (and ONLY) MTB, this recording (I believe done for a radio program) is not of the best quality, but it is a treasure as it is the last performance of the band. We have the Tucker Boys of later years when Doug Gray is mouthing & over-singing the songs. The finest the band was recorded was in Milwaukeee in 1974, then the British recordings are pretty good as well, especially Blue Ridge Mountain Sky. This recording fails in comparison to those. With Doug Gray as producer I feel he probably increased the crowd noise by 500% at times, especially when he is front and center. Stick with the earlier live recordings if you want to hear genuine ""fire"" from the band. These CDs are worth it if you are a loyal fan of the REAL MTB. If not, I'd pass."
1,Not objective,I stopped listening when he said things like:- any product at the center of the store is processed garbage (not true)- the idea of Wal Mart selling organic food is incongruous (it is not).I don't have time for such irrational rants.
4,"Great, but Watch Supersize Me First","This is an interesting book that is a spinoff of the famous/infamous documentary of Spurlock, which goes into a bit more detail about the making of and the aftermath. Has some nice tidbits, such as Subway's offer to Spurlock. A lot of this book is a distillation of various docs and food experts' opinions, as Spurlock is a well-read lay reader, not a expert himself. If you are looking for something of an expert book with the same attitude, Nestle's book is a good choice."
4,Interesting and easy reading,"I found this book interesting and easy reading. I was pleased that the book didn't focus only the author's experiences during his movie-making, but it also discussed the fast food industry, nutrition and health in general, interspersed with interesting anecdotes.For a more comprehensive understanding of the food industry (but a heavier read) I would recommend ""Food Politics"" by Marion Nestle."
2,Stop Blaming Others and DO SOMETHING!,"If you want to play the blame game for your weight problem, then buy this book. If you want to do something about your weight problem, you should check out ""The Overfed Head"" by Rob Stevens. After I read his book, I was able to lose weight without worrying about carbs, fats, proteins, or any sort of diet. I actually lost 15 pounds during the month of December and I still eat fast food! Stevens demonstrates that you don't need to know all of those food facts to lose weight, you just have to pay attention to what your body actually wants. That's how we all did it when we were born. You're smarter than you think......so go out and get ""The Overfed Head"" instead!!!"
2,Biased Information!,"The book did not put me off Mc Donalds at all. I think that we cannot blame junk food for our obeasity. It is our lack of will power that we must blame. If we had enough will power, then why are we fat? Junk food is tasty, convenient, can be purchased almost anywhere and is cheap. We should maybe just cut down on big meals; like Mig Mac and eat smaller meals; smaller food sets, instead. I bet that Spurlock eats junk food sometimes too!"
1,"Here is a better Title: ""Don't Buy This Book""","Spurlock is repeating the same mumble jumble from his documentary ""Supersize me"". He isn't introducing anything new in this book or even in his films. He's basically regurgating the same message over and over again;""Eating too much fast food is bad for you""....Gee, you think so?! I don't see why people are praising this guy. What is it?! Are people just so damn stupid these days? Spurlock and his followers please...don't BITE ME for my critique of this fame seeking sham. Spurlock if you're sick of us eating so much in America just go to Africa and starve like they do over there. Have a nice day."
2,Didn't contain much new info...,"I picked this up after seeing Super Size Me, when I was still in my ""McDonald's is evil"" mindset. I guess I was expecting Spurlock to expand more on issues he had touched on in the movie. Instead, he mostly rehashed the same issues- American obesity, fast food's government ties- in the same way they had been presented in the film. I think I would have found this book much more interesting had I not seen the movie first and was reading the information for the first time."
5,Talk About Muckraking!,"A tragic-comic and enlightening account of the making of the filmmaker-author's McDonalds restaurant marathon, during which he ate every meal for a month at the fast-food giant, with deleterious health results. This grisly read inspired my husband to try to replicate the never-decaying cheeseburger experiment, which Spurlock describes in the book (a cheeseburger left on a high shelf will simply dessicate, not rot, because it is so full of chemicals). Baskin-Robbins' heir John Robbins wrote a similarly eye-opening, stomach-churning book ""Diet for a New America"", which throws bright light onto the corporatization of mega-farm, mega-food practices. Highly recommended."
4,everyone should read this,"This is a really important book. It's a follow-up to the author's film, ""Supersize Me"", which is also very good. Both items underline a critically important issue in the US today: our toxic food environment, and the dangers of the obesity that result from it. However, listening to the audiobook version, I found the author's sassy, snide manner somewhat irritating. (This was less true when I watched his film, as the visual content served to balance things out better.) Also, he throws a lot of statistics at the listener, which might be easier to digest in paper book form. But I have no dispute whatsoever with his arguments, and I do think this is a really important discussion to be having!"
1,the intensive care unit what every family needs to know,"I really thought this book was going to give me perfect insight of what I needed to know when I could not get answers from doctors. Instead this book was poorly written, and did not give helpful information. The doctor that wrote this must be the kind of doctor that most of us get frustrated with when we need answers."
3,Alright,"I thought the description indicated this was a movie, it is not. More of a documentary in my mind. Good thing they do but really boring is you ask me. I thought it was kind of strange that it gives you 7 days for the same price as most 48 hour movies."
2,"I wanted to like it, but I couldn't...","Much as I love Jenna Fisher (that's why I watched the movie), this wasn't really a successful mockumentary. I got the jokes -- the thrust of the film is poking fun at the mindset of those who wrap up their self-importance in the guise of trying to help others -- but the comedy just fell flat here. Much as I wanted to like it, I didn't."
2,Disappointingly amateurish,"We love Jenna Fischer's acting, but we found this quite slow and awkward, like a high-end student film. The pacing was slow and the gags just not that amusing. It was essentially one extended not-terribly-funny joke, and rather painful to watch. We couldn't make it through more than half of the movie; it just felt like an uncomfortable waste of time and money."
1,Lollilove -- Skip it,"I am a big fan of the Office, and of the mockumentaries mentioned, and of just good old regular documentaries, which are often funny unintentionally.I thought there were a few bright moments in this otherwise strained mockumentary. But not nearly enough to make it worth watching.I just didn't like it at all. Although I must say it mocked everything bad about today's affluent yuppie culture. For my money I'll take the utterly horrid couple in Best in Show - the Lawyers with Braces! on My Mac, at Starbucks! It was sooo good. (Best in Show)Lolli-love was not."
5,Fantastic! A mocumentary that both entertains and makes a point!,"This mocumentary is so well done that I found myself having an emotional reaction to it, as if it were a true documentary. Funny, filled with irony and yet socially relevant, this movie is one that everyone should see and will thoroughly enjoy."
4,Beautiful tree,"This tree looks really healthy and pretty(no oranges yet though), I would have rated it 5 stars but it's not organic."
4,"A good ""rough guide""","This book is a good rough guide for anyone interested in visiting Alaska. While it does not get enough into many specifics notable attractions, it does often include sufficient references and resources to find what you want. While the author and editors may not agree, it does not adequately cover the topic of fishing opportunity in Alaska. It could include better references for those opportunities. The author has a decidedly European take on travel. For example, critiques of eating and drinking are given in comparison to the more liberal views on alcohol consumption typical of European norms. A good range of necessary topics is covered to allow a first-timer to plan his trip."
5,Pefect companion.,"My daughter loves The Little Mouse, The Red Ripe Strawberry, and The Big Hungry Bear. She also loves Christmas books so this was a great combination. The illustrations, as with all the Wood's books, doesn't disapoint. The story is short, but lots of room for imagination."
4,Merry Christmas:Big Hungry Bear!,I loved the little details in the illistrations in this book. It is a great story for children at Christmas!
2,disappointing sequel,"We loved the strawberry book, and were very excited to see this one, but it was disappointing. The drawings are great, but the story lacks the charm and depth of the original."
2,Love Audrey Wood...hate this book,I didn't know this book was written by Audrey Wood. I realized it when I started searching for books from her because there are several (like Silly Sally) that my son loves!!!!! I can't believe she is the author of this book...we own it (never looked at author) because my mother-in-law bought it for my son but I hate reading it...doesn't have a story line that he can follow and there isn't a cadence or anything that makes it fun to read. Good lesson at the end but I really don't think a child would understand the lesson as it isn't obvious. Anyway...love Audrey Wood...still going to buy her books...but I wouldn't recommend this one.
2,disappointing,"I hate to leave a negative review, however, this book was a let down after their first BIG HUNGRY BEAR book.My nieces and nephews are BIGGER than huge fans of the first book and when I needed to get one of them a Christmas present (ya know, the one that has everything!) I thought of this.The book does talk about sharing, but doesn't have the cadence that draws the children in like the original."
5,A Christmas Favorite,"With beautifully detailed, expressive and humorous illustrations, and minimal, open-ended text, Little Mouse learns about caring and giving. This book encourages discussion and interpretation. I have read and talked about it countless times with my 2-year-old granddaughter, who will no doubt understand it in new ways as she grows. An excellent, delightful book."
2,faulty product packaging - product compromised?,"I bought several rolls of the Ilford HP5 Plus - which were listed as products sold and fulfilled by Amazon.com directly *up until a couple of days ago* thus this is not suppose to be reflection of the current Amazon merchant, as this product is currently listed as.My issue lies with the integrity of the film itself -- a couple of the rolls arrived with the cardboard box open. While dated with an expiration date of 2016, there is no real guarantee that these film are fresh (and were not substituted for old or expired film).I use to shoot film but since switching to digital, I keep a few inexpensive rolls of negative film for the simple purpose of running a few rolls through my film cameras throughout the year (i.e. maintenance). So even though I am questioning the film I received in this last order, I know -- based on prior experience -- that Ilford HP5 Plus are a great b&w; film and I snagged these at $3.75/roll."
4,Desert workboot,This is definitly a high quality boot. A close up inspection reveals tough seams and a soft rubber that is suprisingly durable so far. It has all the ankle support you would expect from a tall lace up boot. The sole is almost sneaker like. An outstanding combination in a boot!
5,Durable and strong!!!,"Great for Ruck marches, mountain training, desert training. If you are looking for a solid jump from standard issue to personal boots these are the right choice. I wear size 13 civillian shoes and I bought a 12 and that was perfect. I have worn my boots now for almost 2 years and there is nothing wrong with them. These are for the grindstone soldier out on patrol's and marching through ridgid terrain."
1,I was initially happy but...,"These started out as excellent boots. I've been wearing them in the desert for 4-5 months now, 6 days a week. My job requires very little wear and tear. I haven't had any of the usual issues I normally have with boots; The soles and tread are holding up great. They feel awesome on my feet, and I haven't had any significant wearing or tear on the inside of the boot....but, stitches on the toe of the boot have already popped, and a small hole is already starting, thus it's only a short matter of time until they go in the garbage now. 4-5 months in is a no-go. I would most certainly never buy these boots again."
3,"yeah, it's a boot",Nothing to really write home about. The boots seems to be built tough and look alright. Maybe have that slight hazey pinkish look to them as some tan boots do when they are new. I bought these to redeploy in due to the fact that the higher ups wants us to look clean and nice.
5,blackhawk boots,This item was cheaper through amazon than it is through other vendors. The item was in new condition and it arrived in a timely manner. I love this boots as they are extremely comfortable and great looking. I recommend this item to all those in the military.
5,Blackhawk Desert Ops Boots,These are the best boots (out of the box) that I have ever owned. They are extremely comfortable and require little to no break-in period. I wore them on a hike this past weekend and they performed flawlessly. They have excellent traction and the insole is like walking on a cloud.
3,"Somewhat useful, but I wouldn't rely on it.","It's useful for some troubleshooting and specifications, but for full step by step instructions it lacks depth and detail. If you find one used for cheap it's nice to have for reference when you don't have access to the internet."
2,Inaccurate,The first need I had for information from my Haynes Ford Ranger manual was to locate a fuse in my 1999 Ranger XLT. The fuse diagram is wrong. No corrections are available at the Haynes website.
3,Missing 4x4 information for 99 Ranger,"If you have a 99 Ranger 4x4 with auto hubs do not look for the information on the locking mechanism in this book, it is not included. Also, it is missing most of the build specs for the truck, in all this is a general manual that has some Ranger Mazda data. If you are looking for details you will not find them here plus there are numerous errors. I found most of the information on forums and search engines. It took time but less than it did to find out that it is not covered in this book. A good rule of thumb for this manual is to check it out from the Library and see if it has what you need, BEFORE you buy it."
3,More of a question than a review,"I'm thinking about buying this book because I own a 2000 Ford Ranger, code-named J97, built in Thailand for sale throughout the world except North America.Could it be that Mr Gow found the manual inaccurate because the US Ranger is a totally different vehicle from the Mazda-based Ranger that the rest of us use?"
5,an excellent study of female hagiography,"This book is truly an exciting text in the field of hagiography studies. It looks at the stories of female vitae and reads the themes behind them with regard to the issues of denial and spirituality. While in the end, Bynum might lean a bit too far towards a feminist self-image reading, nonetheless, for the most part the book is valuable, well-reasoned and shows the potentialities for scholars of ways to approach the large and somewhat heterogeneous corpus of vitae."
3,complete book of Fly tying,"book shipped in condition stated, but not the book it was advertised as... was kind of looking forward to the correct book ... but... what can you do ... i will keep it just the same... it is interesting to me..."
3,Can be hard to follow,So the book is pretty good information. However there are only illustrations on some processes. And it does not show you how to used all the tools that it describes within the book. I was able to follow along and get a few ideas on making Fly's but I am going to go to the store and look for some other books that are easier to understand.
3,This book was hot back in the day but out dated now,"I got this book a few days ago, I just knew it was a good deal. It was a discarded book from the library. I can see why. It is a book of the past. Books today have better pictures and more detail. In my opinion it will take up extra space, but if you are a collecter it may benefit you.I can teach fly tying better than this book and there are a lot better fly tyers out there than me.Over all not bad for the past but want make the cut for the present.This review is based on my knowlege and personal opinion of this book compared to the ones i have and have veiwed."
2,Boring,"I bought this book because I like to read books about inspiring Christians and I hoped it would be that sort of read. For example, I have treasured books like the hiding place about the ten Booms, The Little Woman about Gladys Aylward, the life and diary of David brainerd, and Bruchko. But this Jimmy Moore book was disappointing. It has a boring feel to it. I wish that I had not spent my money on it."
3,One hit wonders,Good thing I bought this cd for the song drivers seat cause its the only one I like. I would encourage others to try and find this song on a compilation cd if ones available.
4,I like it,"I like it, and why is there arequirement on the number of words you have to write for a review? I like it, and why is there arequirement on the number of words you have to write for a review?"
4,works like it supposed to,Worked perfect for my explorer. I have my new deck installed and its good to go. Not much more to say other than it does what its supposed to do.
5,my PhD rocket scientist loves it too,"It doesn't matter how old you are, if you were interested enough in mathematical books to click this review you should buy this book. My PhD engineer liked it, and so did my fifth graders."
4,Great Music,I Love all of Peter White rendition's and this is no exception. He has a special touch for smooth jazz.
4,News from Down Under,Perfect MomentThis is the third CD I have purchased of Peter White and have found themall to be of great quality and very easy to listen to.(Highly reccomended!)
4,Where Have I BEEN???,"This CD has been out 6 yrs and Im just discovering it on I tunes Ambience Internet radio! I was in the midst of other tasks when ""San Diego"" drifted by..Man it just lifted me back to California yrs ago..down the coast hwy toward Carmel..and it just soared. So to see if I was drifting and not cogent..I saved and played it again and again and it just lifted me right back into that rental car on the California coast... This is the power of tunes..to free you, carry you to a different place than the one you're in with imagery all its own.I hafta do more of this dude.. Each of his tunes named after places just took me back to some aspect of when Id actually been there..again the power of good music and this guy has it..Ill have to stay more tuned"
5,A fresh blend of guitar and brass,Peter Whites latest cd only solidifies this artists talent in the world of smooth jazz. His knack of seeemlessley combining guitar and brass only adds to the gentle flavor of this offering. Put the headphones on and nurture yourself!
3,A decent following to Caravan of Dreams...,"Light and simple, beautiful guitar work from Peter White. Not as full-bodied or intricate as ""Caravan of Dreams"", but delightful nontheless."
5,A light touch,"This is the first CD of Peter White that I purchased after becoming aware of him on a local jazz radio station. His touch on the guitar is light, smooth and the music just flows along. It's a relaxing mix of some slow and danceable music. It sounds to me as though he truly loves what he's playing. Since then, I've bought 2 of his other CDs and enjoy them every bit as much. I'm so happy to have made this discovery."
4,Great Tools But...,"The tools are terrific, but did not include the one driver I was hoping for. I had searched for ""iPhone repair kit"" looking for the specialized screwdriver needed to disassemble an iPhone. Sadly this kit only comes with various sizes of standard straight slot and Phillips tips. As with all Stanley tools the quality is a step above and the price is great. I specifically went for the quality as the reviews of other tool kits for Apple products tended to complain of poor quality and single use products.So, buyer beware... these are not meant for work on your Apple products. Although a couple will be useful, the absence of the pentalobe bit will disappoint."
5,Stanley rocks,Before buying this set I searched a lot and did read a lot of reviews and finally I chose to go with this set. The screwdrivers are very easy to use specially with iphones.I had to change the batterry on my iphone and if Stanley screwdriver set was not there I was about to break my iphone.Thanks for making this set so helpful and easy to use.
3,Could of been a lot better...,"The build quality is all there, it's Stanley (I guess). The only gripe I have about this product is that the tip of the screwdrivers are not magnetized what so ever... (This is partly my fault, I should have looked for magnetized precision screwdriver set.) The fact that the screwdrivers deal with tiny screws should be grounds enough for the tips to be magnetized.Pros: Build Quality is good, Case is solidCons: Not MagnetizedI wouldn't recommend this product to a friend for that cheesy little reason (non-magnetized tips)I"
3,Seem good,Haven't actually used these yet. I bought them so I would have them handy when I do need them. They seem fine.
1,False advertising?,"I just wanted to change my watch battery, but it turns out that the Phillips #0 is WAY too large for any kind of watch, which makes this purchase completely useless.I think it's dishonest to call this a ""jewelers precision"" screwdriver set, when you cannot even use it to change the battery of a Casio G-Shock (which is a pretty big watch). I just ordered the ""Husky 8-in-1 Precision Screwdriver,"" which also includes Phillips #00 and #000 sizes.This set may be OK for laptops, though."
2,needed to have a some of a smaller size in the set,"Okay, but would have liked the set to have included a few more of smaller sizes. No driver small enough for the screws in my eye glass frames"
3,NOT a Jewelers tool,These are nice quality for the money. BUT it is a stretch to call it a Jewelers tool. There needs to be smaller one(s)
5,Mini tools,The product is exactly what I was looking for. It helps working on my model train layout. I did have a set of these mini screw drivers but had misplaced them. I am very happy with my purchase.
4,Cool!,"I use these tools to work on my electronics. They're made very well and are very ergonomic.Oh yeah, they're cheap."
5,Fascinating read...,"I read this book a long time ago and lost it in a divorce but never forgot it. As soon as I saw it on Amazon I had to buy it so that I keep it in my collection. James Carr is one of the revolutionaries of the Black Power era that you'll never hear about normally, he's not well known and he never reached a level of recognition with the public because he was killed so young. This is the evolution of a life long criminal into a revolutionary, similar to many but unique in it's own way. By the end of this I guarantee that you'll be won over by James Carr's story and the loss of his potential. Read it!"
3,another 'whitey made me do it' bio,"to quote richard pryor""thank god we got penitentiaries""a very well writen and imformative book of the california prison system of the late 50s early 60s. a fairly accurate account of the start of the california prison system race war that raged into the 70s and is still felt today.this book fails in the same way that 99% of the other books about the black prison experience fail,no responsibility(see monster).it's always the same refrain,it`s not my fault. the system or whitey made me do it.thats bull.i had relatives in the same prisons at the same time as carr and i have never heard them blame anyone but themselves.at the end i did`nt buy the idea that carr turned his life around.people who turn their life around don`t usually get gunned down in their own driveway"
4,"Taj Mahal, singing solo is dynamite!","""An Evening of Acoustic Music"" is reminescent of ""A Giant Step"" from the late 60's. If you loved that album (as I did) you'll probably enjoy this one too. As the Dirty Linen review points out, the cuts with Howard Johnson playing tuba are weaker than those where Taj flies solo; ""Big Kneed Gal,"" especially, is sloppy. Despite that, the CD, as a whole, makes you feel really good. And a large part of its charm is that it hasn't been cleaned up too much in a studio. This is not a slick recording--it has a very direct, authentic quality, a kind of immediacy rare in the music world today. Its definitely not background music. Because its easy to listen to, you'll put it on while you're doing something else--only to find you're no longer doing anything but listening. Taj Mahal is just so charistmatic here he engages all of your attention."
1,Cradle,Terrible. I know it was used but it was also non working. Where device hooks in is broken and is falling off. Looks like someone tried to glue it on.
3,GREAT PRODUCT - TOO COSTLY!,"This is an excellent product, my only complaint (but it is large@!) is that it is so darn costly and I cannot find a way to purchase them wholesale or in bulk."
3,Works but reeks,"I bought this to help with photo scans. The good news is that it does its job very well. The bad news is that whatever they put in the cloth has a very strong fragrance. Not only does it smell, but it embeds the smell in my fingers and makes my hands burn. Plus, it leaves my fingers feeling like they've been coated in fabric softener. Not fun."
4,Just what I expected.,Factory specifications. Perfect fit and first quality materials. Original lasted about 40 years and this ones seems to be just as good!
5,Great product,Bought product for my wife and it exceeded her expectations. Format is exactly tailored to her needs. She also has the Rosetta Stone material but needed a CD format that she could use during a commute.
2,Pimsleur Is Boring,"I learned basic Italian very well from their very first Italian beginner tapes. I understand they no longer use this instructional design. They should go back to it, because the boring Spanish beginner tape didn't cut the mustard."
5,One great way to learn a language,"I'm an auditive/visual person. Since I'm a linguist and love music, this system is perfect for me. I learn a lot when I hear people saying the words and I can repeat them, specially when pronunciation is key. I'm a perfectionist, and I know that repetition is the way to go. This software provides that and I'm so glad I got it! What a great way to learn a language!"
2,inane prattle has me crying the blues,"While the music here is solid and the packaging first rate, the incredibly annoying voiceover to announce which artist is up next interupts the music's flow and is enough to make one hit the eject button. And that's after the first listen. Trying to get through it again and again is next to impossible. To add insult to injury, because the VO is tacked onto the back of the tracks, RIPing the disc and removing the offending noise isn't a workaround unless you want to start editing audio files.Gimme music without interruption."
4,Finally! Disks that work with my Samsung,"Maxell 8X DVD-R discs worked perfectly on my Samsung DVDR120 DVD recorder when I first purchased it. By the time I ran out of the first 100 discs, the only ones available in stores were 16X. No thanks to Samsung, I realized that the 16X discs were the reason that no matter what brand I bought, the recorder didn't recognize the blanks. These 8X discs, while a little pricier than the sales in stores, resolved the problem. I just hope they remain available as long as my recorder continues to work."
4,Great Tailgating Accessory,Nice to hear Eric Nadel's voice calling a walk-off win for the Rangers against the Yankees. Only improvement would be to update the call to a playoff game from 2010 or 2011.
3,"okay for beginners, if you can get it cheap","Not a good selection of the core of blues harmonica, so ""Essential"" is a misnomer. For instance, only one song by Little Walter and not one of his best-known. The amount of music is on the chintzy side, with an average of only 56 minutes per disk. The liner notes are terrible, about the worst I've ever seen for a well-known label. There are no recording dates and no discussion of individual songs, just a scatter-brained discussion of the history of blues harmonica in multi-colored ink with various font sizes so it's hard to read. I think this misplaced attempt at art was supposed to fool the purchaser into thinking that this was somehow cool. Aficionados of the harmonica want facts, like the recording date and who played in the band besides the harp player, not fluff.This is OOP, so you might want to pick-it-up to fill-in gaps in your collection, but don't waste a lot of dough on it."
4,Wow Chloe.,"This movie was okay, I felt it was missing something. I love watching Julianna Moore's different performances. One to watch!!!!"
2,Is there a script? (Slight spoiler),"Not much of a plot here: Wife suspects husband of cheating; employs a call girl who has problems with honesty to seduce her husband thereby ""catching"" him in the act; oops-wife gets involved with the call girl and then girl wont go away. We end up with a girl-girl rip-off of Fatal Attraction, except here the director attempts to be artsy. Unfortunately, the director's main method of achieving the appearance of art is to have nearly every single line followed by a LLOOOOOOONNNNGGGGGGG stare. I imagine if you cut out the long stares, the movie would probably run a mere 35 to 40 minutes. And the enthusiasm of Neeson's students during his lecture is so fake its nauseating. Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore cannot possibly be proud of this one."
2,Wake me when it's over.,"Atom Egoyan must love watching people stare off into the distance for a really long time.Seriously. Every line of dialogue In the movie is followed by the character staring for a long time. If you cut the long stares out, this would be, like, maybe 20 minutes.I did leave a spoiler warning, but truth be told there's nothing to spoil because you saw it 24 years ago when it was called ""Fatal Attraction"". Woman thinks her husband is cheating. Woman hires a depressed whore to bang her husband, thus catching him in the act. Woman falls in lovemwith the whore. Whore won't go away, blah blah blah.My best advice? Avoid."
4,"Impressive, for a chick flick!","I knew this was a chick flick going in but I was surprised at what I got! What I was most impressed with was Amanda Seyfried. She's done a number of ""chick flicks"" lately but this one had a bite to it. Amanda's wilingness to show all of her glory was surprising. I never thought she'd go there.The ending had a nice twist to it but I think it could've been a bit stronger. Other than that this would make for a good date movie for a guy trying to get some!..."
2,Do Not Waste Your Time,"Although there are excellent actors, this particular movie had an incredibly contrived plot line. It just did not hold up and the interactions among characters were distracting. I recommend renting or buying the original French film ""Nathalie"" with Emmanuelle Beart and Fanny Ardant. There is a very captivating drama."
4,Exciting and sexy,"There isn't much bad to say about this movie. It was thrilling from beginning to end. Julian Moore and Amanda Siegfried were brilliant; Moore is a wife who suspects her husband is cheating on her, and Siegfried is a prostitute. Their relationship is the key to the movie's success.Also, for those who like that sort of thing, there was an intense love scene between the two. Exciting and sexy is a good combination. Chloe is well worth watching and buying."
4,A Welcome Relief,"In this age of inarticulate and random cinematography, it is always a huge pleasure to see mature photography made by and for real adults and that uses the language of cinema to comment meaningfuly on the story and provide a subtext. I loved the way Catherine's thoughts are reflected by the brief images of things going on around her. These images (like that of her pouring a packet of sugar onto her seat in the restaurant) are so well selected that you feel you know exactly what she is thinking and feeling. And just the one shot of the back of her head at the very end (I won't reveal the meaning) speaks volumes. This is real cinema. Also, I loved the way an adult theme was handled unabashedly, objectively, and not without being at least somewhat sexy. A real movie for grownups! I would give this film 4 1/2 stars but don't want to go all the way to 5 because the denouement was indeed very ""Hollywood."" For all the above reasons, including the latter, this film reminded me of Hitchcock."
2,"It had me going then, it left too many holes in the plot.","I thought I was going to get a 2010 Fatal Attraction thing going, but then the plot became predictable and left many holes in the plot. Is the son mad at the mom? Is the mom still in love with Chloe since she is wearing the hair pin?"
5,Poignant drama outshines its explicit sex scenes,"""Chloe"" is an outstanding drama with fine performances from the actors.Fine performances from Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson were no surprise. From the almost supernaturally sexy Amanda Seyfried, it was quite a surprise. She is much more than just a pretty face and a spectacular body.The movie's sex scenes are so poignant that they're almost unerotic.It's too bad that many people who would appreciate a serious, character-driven movie like ""Chloe"" will be put off by the explicitness of the sex scenes."
5,Very Good Movie,I saw a trailer of this movie on the internet and it was the kind of movie that I like. It's a story with mystery and turns out in the end with a twist. It keeps you guessing and wondering the whole way through. Liam Neeson knows how to pick out movies. He's always in movies that are like this.
4,"Powerful, Erotic Thriller","CHLOE is the latest film from screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson, who also penned SECRETARY. Like that film, CHLOE is a tense study of damaged characters. It's erotic, suspenseful, and heads in some surprising directions. At times, it seems like the director was trying too hard to misdirect the audience -- and the ending felt a little flat. The performances from all three actors (Neeson, Moore, and Seyfried) are stellar."
2,Life's too short to watch this movie,"This movie drawls you in,but there's nothing there.The actors are everyone I respect,I've enjoyed there work over the years,and Can't believe they agreed to make this film.I never even heard of ""Cloe""untill I saw it on HBO.It must have went right to video because it was so STUPID."
2,Stars only for the actors,"Two stars for the three leads and nothing else.Boring, slow story; Chloe's motivations are unclear at best; another too-familiar tale of a family with lots of money and a nice house but nothing much going for them; self-absorbed people doing stupid, self-destructive things; stalker girl; dumb ending.Nothing else to say."
2,Dont Buy,"I wish I would have just watched this on tv or even rented it, not worth money or adding to my dvd collection. Movies like this are exactly why I don't purchase alot anymore."
3,Wow,"This movie is completely messed up. Spoiler alert for those that haven't seen it.. I am speechless! Overall I guess it was an alright movie, nothing brilliant but nothing dull either. The intensity of Chloe's character and what she makes Julianne Moore do and go through is ridiculous. Turns out (I think) that everything Chloe told Julianne's character was a lie, to ultimately ruin her life and potentially have what she had.I wouldn't say don't watch the movie, but it definitely was one I probably won't watch again."
2,Okay if you have nothing else to watch,"The movie has some interesting moments but the twist is easy to see a mile away and the ending is too contrived. Even though Amanda Seyfried's character is written to be the crazy one, it's really Julianne Moore's character who definitely has the serious issues. Definitely not Julianne Moore or Liam Neeson's best, but it does make you stop to wonder if we are too paranoid at times and not paranoid enough at others. If there is a moral to this movie (not that I think there is one), it's to always be loving to the ones we love. When you neglect them, bad things can happen and bad people can really mess up your life."
1,"Zero stars would have been appropriate, but for Liam Neesom","This movie was horrible. Amanda Seyfried's character is not a mature seductress. She's so unrealistic that she's predictable. Julianne Moore is a great actress, but I was disappointed she did nude scenes for this piece of trash movie. Liam Neesom was great as usual and I thought the new actor, Max Theriot (as Neesom and Moore's son, Michael) did a nice job and I'd like to see more of him."
3,"3 1/2 stars for a sexy ""thriller"" without the thrills","Prior to watching this remake, I had seen the 2003 French film ""Nathalie"" which is the original title. I wasn't all too happy with ""Nathalie"" because it was all talk. Here we are promised a sexy thriller and while we get the sexy, with the surprising Amanda Seyfried and not surprising Julianne Moore, we also get some laborious dialog. The filmmakers (directed by Atom Egoyan) finally decide to add a little suspense at the end but it just seemed added on to me. Don't get me wrong, it works as a drama most of the time and both the ladies are worth the price of admission. It's just a bit of a letdown."
4,Joseph2012,Suspenseful in beginning . The plot takes a surprise twist at the end. Both lead actresses are excellent and provide the whole movie. See if you can guess ending before last scenes
3,"a more restrained trip through the territory ""Basic Instinct"" plunged through","Atom Egoyan, as usual, examines the human mess inside beautifully sterile, designed environments. This marvelously filmed drama is a more restrained trip through the territoryBasic Instinctplunged through."
1,highly overated erotic thriller wannabe !!!,"dont be fooled by all the hype concerning this film. what could have been something eventful turns out to be overated and a rather contrived plot. amanda seyfried is rather miscast and is unconvincing . as to all the hype concerning the provanity and ""explicit"" sexual dialogue , this has been totaly exaggerated.(american teens use far more explicit and crude sexual dialogue in junior high school) we are exposed to heavier provanity , explicit and crude sexual dialogue in the american pie and dozens of other teen sex comedy movies than this movie. this movie tries to be an erotic thriller but never really delivers and there for a major disappointment."
1,Chloe,"Wish I had never rented or watched this one. Oh My! I never imagined these actors would be in a movie of this ilk. Sorry but, I felt defiled and had to turn it off. I let the names of the actors lure me into renting this one but have definitely learned a huge lesson. Wouldn't even give this one 1 star. This one goes into the negative numbers of stars for me."
4,CHLOE,This movie is much better than I was expecting. It had been recommended to me and I purchased it just out of curiosity.
3,Chloe,I thought this movie was alright. It was a little confusing and a bit taboo. but i guess it just isn't my taste.
3,Good,Never heard or seen this movie till I bought it on Amazon. Never knew Amanda Seyfried could play a vicious girl. It has a big twist at the end.
3,Should had been free,"This movie wasn't to bad, however it should have been free. It was okay if your into a little fun!"
4,Twisted fatal attraction,Always a fan of Amanda Seyfried!! Interesting plot and not something that I would have expected but enjoyable none the less. Movie also has one of the hottest R rated scenes of all movies today.
2,Strange Love... very strange movie.,"Unfortunately, this was just one more movie about SEX. The plot was pretty weak, and it seemed like they really went out of their way to show as many sexual scenes as possible, even when it wasn't necessary to further the plot. I would skip this movie, if I was given the chance again. I watched it on Netflix (through streaming media)and I just wish I could have my 2+ hours back!"
3,"Not the Best, But Still Cute and Worth Watching.","Allright. This is not the greatest Christmas special. But it IS cute, and it IS worth watching. The trolls are comical villains, and it is interesting that some of them do not even know why their boss wants to wreck Christmas. The animation is cute and the songs are memorable. Santa and his elves carry an interesting human as opposed to legendary role. One orginal thing here is that when the reindeer are unable to fly, Santa and the elves come up with the alternate plan of delivering the toys by train. Perhaps the most memorable thing in this is that once the trolls realize that they are not the hated monsters that they thought they were, they mend their ways and actually help Santa and the elves bring Christmas to the world. As I said, this is not exactly an over the boards smash hit. But then it is far from a flop. Take 30 minutes and watch it. You may be pleasantly surprised."
5,One of the best live blues recordings ever !!!!!,"I've been a blues fan for about 10 years now. I've listened to many of the great blues artists. That list includes BB King, Stevie Ray Vaughn, John Lee Hooker, etc. Luther Allison belongs up on the pedastal with the great blues artisis of all time. This live CD will give any blues fan a taste of what Luther Allsion was all about: Red-hot blues guitar and soulful vocals."
1,"A GOOD TRY BUT NO CIGAR, BARRY","AS GOOD AS THIS PROJECT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED, IT REALLY NEVER GOT OFF THE GROUND. BARRY, USED GOOD ARRANGERS BUT THEIR ARRANGEMENTS DIDN'T WORK. I BELIEVE THEY TRIED TO PUT THIS PROJECT TOGETHER TOO QUICKLY. THE PROBLEM WITH DOING A GOOD CD IS THAT IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME, USUALLY AT LEAST 0NE YEAR START TO FINISH. BARRY, GOOD LUCK IN YOUR FUTURE PROJECTS."
2,No No Barry,"As a LONG time fan of Barry Manilow I feel I can say that I don,t think this album is his best,not his worst,but I just can,t get into him singing these Sinatra songs as I dont think he has the voice for them but I thought he would ,as I LOVE the Big Band album,I was looking forward to it.I know he did not want a straight ""copy"" of Sinatra but if he had stuck to the origional arrangements it would have been ten times better."
2,Barry made a poor choice by doing this album.,"While I am a Manilow fan, I am also a bigger Sinatra fan. Being used to hearing Frank sing these songs in his rich tone and marvelous phrasing makes Barry sound like a boy by comparison. I think Barry made a poor choice here because there is no comparison to Frank."
5,Manilow Sings Sinatra With Class,"This cd has a lot of class. It's a beautiful tribute to Frank and no one could have done a better job than Barry. He didn't imitate Frank here, he put his own special magic into the songs. His renditions of ""All The Way"" and ""Angel Eyes"" hit home, they are both so beautiful. And the uptempo tunes are so much fun to listen to such as Come Fly With Me. His original song ""Here's To The Man"" is just pure genius. He seemed to really enjoy himself with this project and it shows. Manilow's cd #30 is a definite Winner!"
2,There is only one Frank Sinatra,"So, Berry Manilow decided to do a tribute album to one and only Chairman of the Board! Do all new arrangements measure up to the original ones done by Nelson Riddle, Billy May, and Don Costa? Is Berry Manillow's vocal as rich and powerful as Frank Sinatra's? If you answer no to these questions, you should pick a real Frank Sinatra Album..-Sinatra Fan-"
5,Absolutely Beautiful,This is a superb CD. I'm a Sinatra fan and I put this music up there with 'ole blue eyes.' The choices of songs are great and of course Barry Manilow's voice is wonderful. I highly recommend this CD.
4,Real talent lies in the arrangement,"Barry's voice does not carry the same ""weight"" as Frank Sinatra; however, it is the skills of the arrangers that allows Barry Manilow to carry this off. ""Stranger In The Night"" has never had a better arrangement than what Doug Besterman did for it. The same holds true of Johnny Mandel for ""I've Got A World On a String"", a light-touch arrangement that even Sinatra's lower voice can't carry out as well as Manilow's. To truly enjoy this CD, you have to have all ready been a Manilow fan. If you have not been, this CD isn't going to change your mind."
4,"This is a terrific tribute to ""Old Blues Eyes.""","Not as good as ""Singin with the Big Bands"" CD that Manilow released in 1995 or ""Paradise Cafe"", this CD is still a terrific tribute to ""Old Blue Eyes."" The difference is that in ""Singin with the Big Bands"", Manilow sang over the original background and orchestra music of the originals like Glen Miller and Johnny Mercer. With the Sinatra CD, Manilow has some great musicians backing him up; however, for example, ""The Summer Wind"" sounds too much like a '70s lounge act. You can't outdo the Nelson Riddle arrangements. Manilow's opening and closings pieces which he wrote truly summarize Sinatra. Manilow's choices are excellent. They just don't write songs like this anymore. Too bad he couldn't add ""Rain or Shine."""
1,Some things should never be done.,"Dr. Leonard McCoy once said: ""Captain, leave medical things to medical men!"" Better advice was never given.I am not one of those who would dis Barry Manilow, just because he is B.M. I enjoy a lot of his original work. He did what he did well. But just as another reviewer, I must ask ""Why?""No one could phrase like The Chairman of the Board. No one could capture a mood; be it patriotic fervor,the triumph of love, the dispair of a lost love like he could. No one has done it like Frank, either before or since.Lamentably, Barry does not come close, even with his own ""style and freshness"". Do yourself a great favor, and get these tunes on one of the dozens of Sinatra collections as Frank did them.Dobie Grey said it best thirty years ago in ""The In-Crowd"": the original is still the greatest."
1,NOT UP TO HIS USUAL STANDARDS,"Did not like this album at all! No emotion in the singing, and not at all like a Sinatra performance."
5,It Grows On You,This CD is excellent because the more you listen to it- the more you'll enjoy it. After the third time I was REALLY enjoying the outstanding style of Manilow. This dude is an outstanding artist.
4,Definitely NOT what you might expect...,"Those looking for ""Sinatra, Jr."" will be disappointed. These are Sinatra's songs, but recorded with Barry's unique style and choice of orchestration. This album is also NOT what one might ""traditionally"" expect from Barry... which shows (again!) that he's not afraid to branch out and try something different. It's also his way to honor a GREAT singer whose vocal chords can never be filled. As such, it's a valliant effort... and I bet even ""Old Blue Eyes"" wouldn't argue with that!"
5,perfect for toddler jackets and hats,"The pile has been moved from the chair to here. Works great for the fireman helmet, batting helmet and baseball caps as well as rain coats, jackets and sweatshirts. And its Cubbies!!! (we also got the Giants rocker, poor kid.. mom's a cubs fan, dad's a giants fan)"
2,"Transformer Movie 3 Pack, Autobot Jazz Bonecrusher, Deception Brawl","The toy come with scratches surface for Autobot Jazz at the top part of the car roof. Left handed part assembled in right handed part for Bonecrusher cause it cannot be transformed to vehicle mode. Repeated same left handed part on right hand site. Some of the joint is pretty loose. If these toys are for collection purposes, you can judge for yourself. Not sure why the QC is so ""loose"" before it reach consumer."
1,Easier to use a manual sharpener,"I purchased and then returned this electric pencil sharpener. There are several things that made it not worth the money.1) Very weak motor. If you push too hard it stalls, but if you don't push hard enough it doesn't sharpen. So you have to work very hard to maintain just the right pressure to get any results at all.2) Even when you get the pressure right, it still doesn't sharpen very well. The point isn't very pointy, and the wood is rough.3) The unit is very light and unstable. There's almost no way to sharpen the pencil with one hand - you have to hold the sharpener to keep it from falling over.4) The shaving collector cup doesn't latch in very well. Any little bump will knock it loose."
4,Little Tank,"It's on the loud side for classroom use--and there's nothing to let you know that the pencil is sharpened, i.e., it grinds and grinds.But it's a tough little cuss and shows no signs of slowing down through the type of hard use 116 8th graders can dish out day after day."
2,weak,"I bought this sharpener for very cheap and soon learned why. The pencil got sharp, but the motor almost quit trying to do it. It looks nice, sleek, kinda like a mouse. Great desk decoration, or something to make it look like you do alot of work, but do not buy if you are really wanting to sharpen many pencils."
2,"Noisy, slow goodness","This little unit has soldiered along now for well over a year. It works, but is very slow and whiny. Looking for a better one now, not because this one is broken, but because I'm tired of waiting whilst being serenaded by the ""reer-reer-reer-reer-reer-reer"" this thing makes."
1,Didn't last long..,"I was so glad to finally have an electric pencil sharpener. It worked like a charm. However, in less than 1 year it did not sharpen our pencils anymore. The motor still worked and the sharpener still turned but it was useless. It seemed that maybe something (lead or wood) was stuck in it so that the pencils were not able to contact the sharpener. We took it apart twice, and nothing seemed to be lodged in it. Now, we are looking for another electric pencil sharpener."
2,Not Worth It,"I bought this about 4 years ago. I am now shopping for a new one. It functioned fine at first, with minimal use a few times a week, though it did take forever (about 45 seconds) to sharpen a new pencil. Over the past year, it has been getting weaker, and now the motor has all but died. For what these cost, I would rather spend twice as much, for one that should last more than twice as long, and sharpen better, too."
4,A Great Deal,"This pencil sharpener works very well, and at this price it is a great deal. Many pencil sharpeners fail after a while and don't sharpen well, but this one is excellent and gives pencils a nice point."
5,Electric pencl sarpener,I was very satisfied with the sharpener. I gave it to my nephew as a part of his birthday gift. I help him with his homework and it seemed his pencils never had a point.Thank you.
1,Mighty Mite Electric Pencil Sharpener,"Love the green color, shapens well, easy to use, easy to empty, and it holds up to kids. Low price and fast delivery. Glad we got it."
2,"Salacious, poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly filmed","Why is this a pick for some film festivals? Looking for something different, and not much available I suppose.Starts off being overly salacious. Keeps a bit of that throughout. The directing is herky, jerky and not very real. Characters are similar. Acting is poor at best. Story is a bit off kilter and perhaps the only redeeming quality. But so much of the basic interaction is wholly unbelievable. Quality of video at least as a streaming Amazon movie is poor.Kept wanting to like it, but never could. Cliched and no real redeeming value, no intrigue, no real reason to watch it. Don't waste your time, better stuff is out there."
5,The best wiper ..... ever,Every time I buy a vehicle I put these wipers on and never had to replace them. They run smoothly even at high speed with no streaking. Highly recomended.
1,Arrived in correct package but wrong length,"I ordered these last summer and put them away for a rainy day.Today I see that I have the correct package and part number, however the refill blade inside the very shortIt is not 20.5 inches in lenght!If it was actually 21 inches it would have worked.Epic FailAnd now too late to get a refund."
5,Horror In Chicago,"If you're from the Chicago area, you'll have even more reasons to enjoy this book. The story takes place in Chicago and it's even scarier to imagine these things happening in so many familiar places. Todd Hayes did an amazing job with his intense imagery. I wonder where it all came from. If it's part of his every day thoughts, he must have a very twisted mind. If these are things he dreams, I can't believe he would ever choose to go to sleep. I've got to admit I lost a little sleep the first couple of nights after I read it, but it certainly helped me remember to say my prayers!"
5,This new author is fantastic!,"I bought The Hollow on a recommendation from a friend in Chicago. What a great surprise! Todd Hayes wrote a remarkable book. I am pleased to have a first edition of this book. The imagery was great, it made me excited, scared, and repulsed. I put everything else in my life aside for a day and a half until I finished it. I am recommending this book to everyone I see. I can't wait for his next book!"
4,Intimate Strangers,"An attractive woman walks into an office she believes to be that of a psychiatrist and proceeds to reveal her innermost secrets to a baffled tax lawyer. Cue conflict, misunderstandings and wary mutual attraction. That's it really, but charmingly done with good performances and just a hint of underlying menace. Those who are afraid to `make the first move' or have ever regretted not doing so may find themselves squirming in identification with the male character. Enjoyable."
3,"A few twists, but not enough","The male lead here is pretty much expressionless throughout, and I grew weary. There's a dark undercurrent of violence that never explodes and leaves you awaiting something much darker that seems about to happen, but never does. The director strove for a lot of erotic tension, I suppose, but there really isn't much chemistry between the estranged wife and the tax accountant. I had a hard time even picturing him with his still-around ex who keeps coming back to taunt him while flaunting her new beefier beau. This is a typically French modern drama with minimal dialogue and many long pauses and looks. I liked it."
2,Identity Crisis!,"The two main characters are very difficult to understand, in terms of credibility. He is so passive, that her attraction to him is just not believable. She is so strange, and so disturbed, that her attraction to him seems strained and beyond understanding. Undoubtedly, there are many sad and lonely and strange people in the world, but in this movie these characteristics are taken to the extreme.It is interesting to note how the real Psychiatrist is portrayed . . as a self-important, money grubbing incompetent . . perhaps his portryal is the truest, most credible part of the movie. All in all, the movie has an identity crisis where it does not identify with real people in real life."
3,interesting subject gets a not so interesting treatment...,"Intimate Strangers has some very good moments which compel you to watch more - particularly as the main character wrestles with the mystery of his strange guest.. yet the psychological interest is saddly so spread out and sparse that it is a little difficult to wade accross the entirety of this film.. Somehow you think that a mystery is being held back.. and yet when certain plot elements are revealed it comes as a gret let down..Nevertheless, there is some fine acting in this movie and at times it truly does shine.. I would recommend it.. but at the same time caution against any high hopes.."
2,Button-sized capsule review from my Archive,"Not enough. A little tale of a solitaire finance advisor and a crazy woman in the search of I don't know what. Did not fill me. It doesn't meant nothing. The shaky movements of the camera inspired only doubts about the reasons of the director. Jump cuts and strange framings of body parts, all the time shaking, and for what? Who knows... In the positive side, have some nice performances, but that are completely accessories to the minimal story."
4,The risks of being spatially dyslexic,"Anna's spilling her guts to a tax accountant, mistaking his office for that of a therapist down the hall, is rendered understandable when she explains that she gets lost easily, confuses right with left, etc. The accountant can't get a word in edgewise as this woman unloads intimate details of her relationship with her lover; his face undergoes a huge range of befuddled emotions, and suddenly, without him quite realizing how all this could be happening, he find himself confirming an appointment with her for the next week.Until that day, the accountant's life had been pretty boring, and he expected nothing more. The volatility of Anna's presence, her interest in continuing to use him as a sounding board even after she discovers her mistake, and the attachment that develops between these two `strangers' is funny, touching, and revelatory.Top-notch."
4,Private conversations,"I absolutely loved this casual French movie about a Parisian woman experiencing marital strain. She decides to seek a professional help and accidentaly discloses her personal information to a man who is a tax attorney, not a therapist. As it happens, he also experiences difficulties in his relationship and the two connect on a platonic level. They share their intimate parts of their lives with each other. However, it seems that more that they get to know about each other the more consuming their relationship becomes. Can they cut the cord and create new lives? Their genuine fondness between each other enables them to create a bond that is as strong as it is sincere and true. This is a great movie for those quiet evenings when one just wants to lurk into a story about other peoples lives that sometimes, unexpectedly unfold in the most unexpected ways."
2,The caboose of Cesaria,"You own every other one of her records, right? And you still would like more songs OK, this is the one to buy - the very LAST one - only recommended in that circumstance. Or, perhaps, if you relish the idea of her great talent nearly suffocated by poor production choices - made all too obvious by the rapturous greatness of her other CDs. OK, she could not really make a 'bad' record, and there are some fine songs on here as well. Die hard fans, go for it!"
4,"Good toddler wipes, but small surface area for infants..","I would only purchase these wipes for potty training or toddlers to use. I would not at all recommend them for your infant's diaper change. The surface area is ok for kids to use themselves, but are way too small for a diaper change. They are not too wet nor too dry. Also, they didn't break my little girl's bottom out at all."
4,I love these,I like baby wipes that I can flush. A lot. These are the best! The last order I placed with Amazon was the wrong kind. Which is the first time Amazon has ever biffed an order of mine. Which is fine. Even the non-sensitive ones are not so bad.
4,Much easier for the kiddies,"These wipes are a lot easier on tender bottoms than regular toilet paper. I also think they tend to get more of the nastiness off. My son has a much easier time with these than w/ t.p. Another cool thing about them is the dispenser. You just peel a sticker off the refill, open the dispenser, pop in the refill and you're ready for action. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the dispenser lid is a little difficult for a kid to operate. Even I can't always get the lid to stay down. If the lid doesn't stay down, the wipes get dry and that kind of defeats the purpose."
1,Should have tried before making such a big purchase!,"I was not familiar with this product before I purchased it. I just liked the flush-able aspect. Plus the term ""Sensitive"" suggested that it would not be offensively scented. And, the price per wipe was good. Unfortunately, they are useless to us. These wipes are very, very fragrant. When we are in the bathroom, the question, ""what's that smell?"" should be reserved for the obvious, NOT the odor of the wipes!! These wipes are tiny and thin, too. Not the same size as other pop-up flush-able wipes, so a new dispenser is required. I think my toddler will have more success just using toilet paper or a full-sized cloth wipe and water. Obviously someone likes this product. Hopefully I can fine a worthy donee."
4,Loved it,Buy it! You will love it. I have seen them all. One of my favorite shows of recent memory. Just as good as The Wire or Boardwalk Empire.
3,A Curious Collection of Contemporary Comments,"As a Titanic buff, and member of the Titanic Historical Society, I couldn't pass up this bargain book. It appears to be a collection of contemporary reactions to the disaster from that era's versions of ""People"" magazine. It's somewhat valuable as a curiosity, but not of much value for research, as there are no attributions to the sources.I'd recommend it to those truly fascinated by the disaster, if only for the price."
4,curious,I found the book Story of the Wreck of the Titanic and was wondering what it might be worth.
5,story of the wreck of the titanic,"We have a hardbound copy bound in good book cloth of the 1912 memorial edition and the page with Captain Smith's photo has an unidentified person's signature. Who is Miss Glenda Mae Sitze??? Does the first edition have a photo of the Titanic and are the words ""Nearer My God To Thee"" inlaid top of book cover? If you have any info please e-mail me curry@dublin.com"
2,ATTENTION WORD-SMITHS,THIS BOOK TAKES A LOT OF CONCENTRATION. I is great for a Word-Smith. I have poor sight so I couldn't stay with it. It is very English-English.
5,BEST SHORT TITANIC BOOK,"This is probably my favorite short book on the Titanic. It may not have all the material available elsewhere, but for a pretty quick read, it is about as good as they come. Those who like to curl up and read history books should have a great time here.Authors Eaton and Haas have written several Titanic books, and in most they have skipped over the sinking itself and concentrated on other aspects of the disaster. Here the sinking is the focus. The 1912 disaster unfolds for the reader. A wonderful set of illustrations complements the text as well."
4,Really Good!,"This book is the second book that I bought about Tianic. It is not the best Titanic book that I have read, but it's excellent facts have helped me a lot in my Titanic project that we're doing in English at school. It's really well written and the accounts of some of the survivers are really interesting. I'd reccomend this book to all Titanic fans - Lauren, 13"
1,disappointment,"After the rise in quality with each successive album(Yes, I did like Holy Smoke!)from ...World to the brilliant Cascade,this EP was a huge disappointment!The remakes are a desecration of the originals. Peter Murphy has long been one of my favorite artists.I await the next release with trepidation."
5,A story for the ages,"This book is one of my favorites of all times, it makes you laugh, cry, get angry, be sad and touches all of the rest of your emotions. Being of Irish decent and hearing the stories of my aunts and uncle when I was growing up I really enjoyed this book.Uris is the first person to tell the story of Ireland in a way that makes me understand some of the issues that caused the troubles in its violent past. You might come away hating the English, but you will also have some strong feelings about the Catholic Church.This is a big book and it tells a big story, basically it deals with one family and cover 2 generations during the late 1800s and early 1900s. I have read this 3 times and will probably pick it up again somewhere down the line. Once I start it I can't put it down even though it can make me very angry at the way the Irish were treated.I think this is a must read for anyone who wants to understand ""the troubles"" of Ireland."
4,Got my Eire blood going!,"I just finished reading it yesterday, sigh! It was a very long book. The beginning was at first easy and then hard to get into. After a few chapters I was married to the book until I finished it. As an American with Irish blood I am totally niave of my heritage. The fact and fiction of the book brought insight as to the plight of my ansestors. It also shed light on human nature and its flaws. All through the book I asked myself ""How can people act this way?"" The reality of the book is shocking and demands a moral reaction from the reader."
5,I can't stop thinking about this story.,"This book has everything. I do not remember how I got my hands onto this book, but I am 14, and can say that it is my favorite book and probably always will be. Conor is a hero, my hero, and I can't stop thinking about his story."
5,A must read for anyone with a passion for history,"Seven hundred pages couldn't keep me from plowing through this novel in a few days' time. The fascinating day-to-day life of Conor, Seamus, Caroline, et al grips the reader as it evolves over the course of a lifetime. Growing up in an Irish neighborhood, I was always stricken with the passion that these people have for their history and plight in the homeland. After the conclusion, I found myself wishing I were Irish as well."
3,This is not an Irish Exodus,"I had high hopes for Trinity, Leon Uris would tell the story of the Irish Rebellion with the style and excitement he showed in Exodus. The book started well, Michener has shown me how valuable 200 pages of background and story development can be in a historical novel. I was however at first surprised and then dismayed when the book developed the story line of an afternoon soap opera, the characters become caricatures and the story line ends up melodramatic and contrived. I wanted to understand the history of the Irish, Catholic Church, Scotch Irish, and English; and I get a set of late 20th century values, morphed into this late 19th, early 20th century story. As always, Uris's writing is clear and stylish, but the story he tells is far below expectations.This is Tripe, not Trinity."
2,A Flawed Novel,"It is obvious that Leon Uris undertook a lot of research before writing this novel as he marks a lot of the subtle grey-areas of Irish politics and social issues of the time that tend not to be noticed by non-Irish writers and commentators.Although remaining an engaging read, Trinity for me is flawed exercise because of the style of character dialogue that Uris employs, a style which appears to have been lifted straight out of Darby O'Gill and the Little People. Copious references to 'the fairies' abound.Other gaffes in the dialogue include a character using the word 'robot' in 1905 and another character in a scene from the late 19th century using the phrase 'human rights'.I may be pedantic in raising this criticism, but it seems a shame that such work should have been put into the historical research only to have it undermined by such poor and uncredible dialogue."
5,gfinnegan,"This is by far the best book I have ever read. Since my first reading of the novel, I have made a point of studying Irish history. The story Uris conveys is so penetrating that you feel a part of the Larkin clan, and want to know more about their history and the history of Ireland. Although a piece of fiction, this novel has so much truth in history to it, that the research alone must have taken Uris some time to copile. In any event, it will go done as a true classic piece of literature. Unfortunately, this is where it stops for Uris. His sequel, Redemption, does not hold true to the original in many ways. I advise avoiding the sequel so that you can retain the highest regard for Trinity."
5,The Novel Trinity,Leon Uris novels are treasures and I am reading Trinity for the second time.The condition of the book received was excellent.
2,print way too small,The story is excellent however the paperback copy I purchased for a friend has such tiny font it can't be read.
3,NOT A TYPICAL URIS,"This is a good book, but it is lacking Leon Uris. The book is very slow and there is no excitment in it. I wonder if Leon Uris was excited when he wrote it. I read it, I own it, and I recommend it, but I liked his other books better."
2,who'd would make a good Conor?,The first time I read the book the ending stunned me. In fact the whole book stunned me until I found out just who Leon Uris based the character of Connor on. Martin McGuinness! So now we can relax and imagine if Connor had lived until he was sixty years old what he'd of looked like. Would he have developed a bad temper due to getting knocked out playing football and the swarms of angry Protestants after him and succeeding in beating him. No way would he still be singing the Rising of the Moon another few head banging times! It's a easy book to read not really insightful about any character fairly accurate history and of course CONOR. I wonder if Mr. Mc Guinness has ever read it
1,"Condescending ""blarney"" of the first degree","The popularity of Leon Uris shouldn't surprise me, but his truly awful writing style was a shock and I found this book nearly unreadable. His condescending depiction and blatant stereotyping of the post-famine Irish is insulting and childish. He uses details that can be gathered from any schoolboy's history of Ireland to prove his ""expertise"" on the subject matter, and flavors his characters dialogue with phrases that no self-respecting Irishmen ever spoke - to give you a taste of his style, he uses the descriptor ""wee"" dozens of times in just the first 20 pages of the book. Compared to a masterwork like ""Angela's Ashes,"" this is little more than a Jackie Collins-style novelization of the history of Ireland."
2,An agonizing tale...literally. It took me 5 weeks to read.,"First off, I must say that I detest this book. I read 800 pages only to be rewarded with 16 pages of action at the very end of the novel. I agree, that Uris writes extremely well, however just as history repeats itself, so too, does the plot. Perhaps the plight of the Irish is well portrayed in this story, but nothing is achieved, and all the Catholic murders go unavenged. I give this book five stars for style, but I take away three for my frustration."
2,TRINITY,Leon Uris is capable of much much better writing. After reading Exodus and A God in Ruins I had high expectations for Trinity. The stroy line is shallow and the love story is about as deep as most teenage love storys. I'm an Irish-American so I know about the problems in Northren Ireland. Let's just say that Uris should have done some more research. The only redeemable part of the book is the part before Seamus and Connor grow up.
3,Great book for Irish-Americans interested in their heritage.,"If you know nothing about Irish history, but are anxious to learn, this is the book for you. If you know Irish history fairly well, this book might be a bit simplistic."
4,A whole new perspective.,"I started reading this, interestingly enough, this summer on a flight to Dublin and finished it on my flight home 6 days later. My trip, I think, had much to do with how I felt about the book once I completed it. Prior to being in Ireland, I was reading as a complete outsider. I didn't get as absorbed into the characters as I did returning. Being in Ireland...being in the places mentioned in the book...spending time in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland changed my experience in reading. I became much more passionate about the fight that was fought and the principles these men believed in. Without this experience surrounding my reading of this book I would have only given it 2-3 stars. The 4 stars are completely subjective and are reflective entirely of how I experienced this book. I recommend it but cannot promise it will change your world."
3,A very useful guide...,"This large anthology of form poetry (almost 500 pages) bridges the gamut, from haikus to pantoums, from rondels to sonnets, from villanelles to sestinas, with the works of modern (20th century) poets, many quite legendary. The introduction alone is a great essay on the ways to find alternatives to traditional form…and stay in form. Even better, in the back of the book, there are appendices that lists the forms published and who wrote them…and, alternatively, which poets employed which forms."
1,Very disappointing,I have painstakingly gotten through this book. I would have not read it in its entirety had I not thought it just might get better. Complete waste of time for someone who knows nothing of the people written about. I found that this author is very witty and funny at times throughout this book but it just can't make up for the pure spitefulness and long windedness of material already spoken about earlier in the book. Thumbs down on this one.
1,Poor rich kid,"This author needs to have this book truly edited. This editor was not doing his job to the reader. As I'm sorry that he had to go through such a sad divorce but more than half of the kids in this country has been touched with the same pain. Maybe not as publicly but the pain is still the same. My huge question is what is the motive to write this book? I sure hope this made him feel better because he seems to me like a person that needs a ton of help. The start of this book was some what funny...then it just seemed to drag and drag. There is only so many times you can hear the same story written slightly different and still be entertained by it. I love to read but this has got to be the hardest and worst book I have read in several years. I can't recommend anyone to read this book, it was just too painful."
1,Sean has a big chip on his shoulder,"I put this book down after reading the first half. Theinsights into the upper levels of SF society were interesting,but Sean's perspective really soured the experience. It sounded as though Sean had an upbringing superior to most, includingextreme privilege and decent support from his parents. Hisresponse is a whining stab in the back. I wonder how he'd feel ifhis son did the same."
1,not interesting,My daughter gave me this book and said it was supposed to be so funny. It was long and hard to stay with and sometimes mean. If you don't care about society people in San Francisco it isn't so interesting.
3,Needed more editing,"I wanted to like this book. I was drawn to the subject matter, and I generally love memoirs. The story itself was compelling - rich kid with screwed up parents and an evil stepmonster - but it was just too long with too many uninteresting details. I wish the book had been about 200 pages shorter, and it would have kept me more interested.On the plus side, I did enjoy knowing that this book chronicled every nasty piece of information about that horrible Dede Wilsey. Now that's revenge, in its finest form! I would have given anything to have seen her face when she read it; I'd love to know how the publication of the book altered her place in society. Worth buying if for that alone - revenge is sweet!"
1,I started rooting for the stepmother!,"The book get a great review from the NYT, and I decided to give it a spin. I didn't like it. During his childhood the author was emotionally abused by parents and stepmother alike, and I guess he thought he could strike back, particularly at the stepmother, while earning a voyeuristic tell-all type buck.But the thing drug on and on, he apparently had no editor, and I think of the saying that the only thing an American hates more than a bully is someone who won't stand up to a bully. I finally skipped the middle and jumped to the back, only to encounter more boring and frustrating material.I'm honestly confused why so many people enjoyed reading the book. Perhaps a type of reading schadenfreude aimed at wealthy people. I dunno.Not recommended."
2,Oh The Glory of Excess,"Look, I know James Frey is considered a big fat liar in the world of memoirist literature, but at least he's compelling in his story telling. Sean Wilsey had an absolutely messed up childhood, complete with a suicidal socialite Mother, a narcissistic distant Father, and a Stepmother truly descended from Satan. The book follows his descent into juvenile delinquency, and various extreme boarding schools,until he ultimately finds a path towards peace and redemption in an Italian reform school. I think I would've loved this book had it been two hundred less pages. I just began to resent the plodding narrative that veered off course numerous times into mind numbing side tracks detracting what is at the core a moving book about a boy trying to have a relationship with his father."
3,"good, but not great","I was really looking forward to this book, but as my best friend said after we read it ""he needed it get it more in a nutshell"". I agree. That is it in a nutshell! Still interesting, but pages and pages of unnecessary information. He needed a better editor."
3,caution!,"... be careful of this book. Having read a review of it in N.Y. Times book review, I was hoping it would be more about the eccentric mom,but it is largely about the son's traumas at boarding school. If you were traumatized at Upper class boarding schools, you may like it. I found it dish water dull"
2,Starts well...,"then descends into self indulgence. If he had stopped about one-third of the way in, this would be a witty, engaging book. As it is, it reads as if he were being paid by the word. Virtually unreadable for the most part. Off to the remainder shelf."
2,Oh No! The Gory of it All...,"Oh: I now know more about another person's bodily fluids than I ever wanted to. The Glory: Yet another memoirist who glorifies what a bad, cool, messed up kid he was (exactly what James Frey is now in hot water over). In fact, reading this made me feel the way Sean seemed to as a teenager: bored, sarcastic, and angry. Of it All: The book would have been much better at half its length. While it's easy to have sympathy for Sean's suffering at the hands of his family, he spends little time offering any real understanding of why and how it all affected him."
1,Boring & whiny,"Do we really need another ""Mommy Dearest""? I just feel that if the stuff in this book is all he had to complain about while growing up, he should have hung around my neighborhood. Poor little rich boy. Should have stopped whining and done something productive, or at least interesting, in his youth. Read Jeannette Walls' ""The Glass Castle"", for an admirable look at someone who really had a tough time."
4,A wonderful read,"_Oh the Glory of It All_ is an honest, humorous, and generally very well-written memoir. Although the narrative would have benefited from the excision of quite a few pages, reading to the end is ultimately rewarding. I admire the author for having put so much of himself forward, and for having acknowledged those who have shaped him. The book could have been improved if he had consistently remembered to connect with his reader, rather than meander for too long into documenting minutiae of his and his family's life. Though the author is at times aggravatingly solipsistic, Wilsey manages to rely on his family's glitter without being conceited. He puts forth the circumstances of his life without judgment, but still calculates that most readers will be awed. It is this manipulation that primarily mars the book, but the final chapters are so moving that most readers will forgive the compromising devices that are too often interjected into the lengthy middle portions of the book."
2,Ok book to read at best,"I was shocked to see what great ratings this book has received. It was a decent read about 1/3rd of the time - the rest was boring jargon that seemed to me to be written just to get revenge on Sean's (the author's) stepmother. True, she is the epitome of an evil stepmother, but the Author would go on and on about pointless stories/events just to have it in there.I think the bottom line is that it had potential, but lost me in its 479 pages."
4,Family of Nutjobs,"Wow, a story like this makes you really appreciate your own family! Prior to reading this, I had never heard of Al Wilsey, Pat Montandon or Dede Traina so I was really surprised to figure out after a few dozen pages that this was a true story, a memoir. I definitely liked it - well written and very entertaining tale of growing up in a bizarre, emotionally abusive but otherwise decent, family. I'm sort of curious to read Pat's book (an account of roughly the same time period by the author's mother) to get her perspective, but this book so convinced me of her tendency to exaggerate and poor grasp of reality that I doubt I would believe a word she says."
4,Very well written.,"Written with humor, I couldn't put it down. A well-told story where the writer was willing to show his own warts. What a journey the author has been on by such a young age. As a long-time resident of Nob Hill, I have bored myself through a few issues of the Nob Hill Gazette. Somehow those papers won't seem nearly as boring now! Well done. Looking forward to Mr Wilsey's next book."
5,DeDe Wilsey is Horrendous!,"This book was a quick read for such a hard life for Sean Wilsey. It makes me so angry knowing that Dede Wilsey has gotten away with so much. I just hope that this book brings the karma that she deserves. It's a great book, a very interesting read."
5,LOVED THIS! Could not put it down!,"Sad, funny, fascinating. I was especially interested in his depiction of the various schools he attended (especially since my brother went to St. Mark's -- and liked it, by the way). The parts about his mother's self-promoting ""Children as Teachers of Peace"" project had me laughing like mad. I highly recommend this!"
1,"Slow, boring, like a sketcheless canvas","Though a good mixer, Tracy just doesn't know how to keep the energy up. Try someone else, or buy this in order to fall asleep."
4,"Good for the money, but short-lived","It's very comfortable and more stable than ""American type"" spreader-bar hammocks. Buy it for comfort, though, rather than looks. It's beautiful when new, but the fabric starts to fade within a few weeks (even in partial shade in Portland, OR) and gets shabby and worn looking before the end of the season. Good for an out of the way corner of the yard. At this price, you can replace as needed."
4,relaxing,Hammock is great however its displayed with a pillow. I was disappointed that it didn't come with the pillow since you advertised showing one.
4,Lasted 7 years!,"Today I went online to buy a replacement hammock for this hammock. We have had this exact hammock for about 7 years. We've abused it, used it, the kids played on it- for Seven years. This year a string broke and the fabric ripped - but we really abused this thing. It's really strong, durable and comfortable. However the one thing I didn't like about it is that it's kind of hot - so I guess we'll try a rope hammock."
5,Love it! worried a little about structural strength longevity,Installed the hammock and enjoying. Always have to worry about the Arizona sun destroying things... so will have to be better about not leaving it hung for extended periods of time. Great instructions for installing etc. Only concern is the stitching will hold long term the fabric connection. I would recommend to manufacturer reinforce those areas. Although I have no problems you can tell the weight of the person hangs on the center section.
1,they never mentioned sizes ...I got it and it was too small...had they mentioned sizes I would have checked..,Make sure you check to see what size hammock you need...I thought it was one size fits all because the sizes werent offered...mine was too small and I had to pay $15 to ship back a $30 item..wont buy from them again.
3,It was much smaller than expected.,"I looked for the largest hammock I could find on Amazon.I measured my frame.This hammock is really too small for the frame. It may work between a couple of trees, next spring."
5,Ladies and Gentlemen - The ROLLING STONES!!!,THis is one of my top 10 all time favouriste CD's. If you like the Rolling Stones and GREAT covers - this is it!!! Absolutelt FANTASTIC +++++++
5,TV at its most distinguished.,"This episode manages to be highly original with some highly unoriginal material--mainly, the ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme and the ancient sci-fi cliche of saving the future by traveling to the past. ""The Outer Limits"" had a genius for making the old seem new, and ""The Man Who Was Never Born"" may be the most distinguished example thereof. The new series, by contrast, achieves exactly the opposite by making newer themes seem old and stale through cliched presentations. Same name, very different series.Martin Landau is superb as Andro, the sensitive and peace-loving human mutant from the future who hates the task he must carry out. Everyone is top-notch, in fact. The themes within themes make each viewing a new experience.The masterful direction is by Leonard Horn, who went on to contribute in a major way to the original ""Mission: Impossible"" series, his finest achievement being that series' ""Operation: Rogosh,"" now available on video."
5,Wonderful music - but recorded in monaural (non-stereo).,"Digital purists who shy away from older analog recordings will fail to find the many huge, hidden, Ali-Baba caves of musical treasure. The sound on this monaural recording is very clear and non-distored, and is pleasurable to hear. I think the lack of stereo is actually a plus, given the stupid-minded antique stereo-balancing of subsequent Brubeck Quartet recordings. I love this music: Some of my favorite Brubeck and Desmond tracks are here!"
