1,Great PR,"Great PR. That's it. Buy one single and you will have heard everything the Strokes have ever done.If you want to hear someone play the same song dozens of different ways, you're better off checking out the garbage the Stones put out in the eighties."
1,Negative 5 stars,"I'll keep this quick...The day that a bunch of anemic fashion models who can't create music worth half a damn are heralded as the ""saviors of rock"" is the day that Adam Jones (from Tool, you should know this) joins Limp Bizkit to play guitar...failing miserably to sound like their ""influences"" and having a singer who acts like Liam Gallagher from Oasis onstage equal one thing-the epitome of over-hyped commercial driven schlock that makes Drowning Pool sound like The Who..........I'd rather swallow white hot razor blades than have to listen to this bunch of androgynous juveniles again"
1,The Grandchildren of the Velvet Underground...,had a baby with Joey Ramone. It died. It's body is here in this CD. Let it rest.
2,they are almost tolerable,"Alright, I'll be one of the only people to say the strokes are not that good. I like the same exact music as people who like the strokes (i.e. weezer, radiohead, the shins, built to spill, etc.) but they are really overrated. I will say, for a band being a MTV favorite, they are better than most others chosen by that station, but that is still not saying much. It's decent for a popular group, but don't get fooled by the hype. These guys are not the saviors of rock and roll, and i think with them comes a new term not yet developed ""Corporate indie rock"". It doesn't really make sense, but then again....."
3,williamsburg gimic,"yeah this stuff is catchy and it sounds cutting edge but the strokes are just gimic driven rich kids who buy their vintage clothing in trendy New york shops. This is the most souless music out there and they are treated like the purveyors of the new rock movement when in actuality, they are only mimicing the an allready existing new garage rock revival. This is just pop dressed up in some sort of street cred veil. listen to the hives instead. Or Radio Birdman, or the stooges, or the dirtbombs before deciding how good the strokes really are. I know it's supposed to be just about the music but the strokes' just carry to much contextual baggage to be accepted as a legitimate garrage rock band."
1,Pardonnez moi ...,"The strokes are NOT raw or edgy -- They are Pop rock, nor are they part of any ""revolution"". They have songs you can listen too but PLEASE PLEASE don't say they are the saviours of Rock Nad roll or compare them to any other band. This album is what it is -- nothing spectacular at all.gimme a break."
2,Typical NY hype job,"The criticla praise for this album from critics in general and NY critics in particular reminds me a lot of the way NY sportswriters cover the Knicks. Basically, the Knicks have been pretty [sad] for the last few years, but every time they win 2 in a row, the ""critics"" start to tout them for the championship. Same thing with the Strokes- NYC hasn't had too many killer bands in the last few years, so when they get something halfway decent, they try to pretend it's the second coming of the Velvets or the Heads. Basically, this is a pretty weak album. Try a little Bardo Pond or Yo La Tengo or Wilco!!"
5,Is This It for The Strokes? I sure hope not,"Just recently I saw The Strokes perform at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, Cali. The energy exerted by the band while performing was simply phenomenal and overall a life-changing experience. Julian's amazing lyrics and awesome voice were almost too good. These kids are going to be around for a long time to come. So you all you wanna-be underground rock connoisseurs can put the thesaurus' down and start to admit that The Strokes great. Thank you for your time.Be sure to listen to Track 2- The Modern Age"
5,Nostalgia,"One word...NOSTALGIA. this cd has a nostalgic feel that is very laid back and very cool. is this it is also very simple so dont expect heavy metal rifts or julian to scream his brains out. my favorite trac is hard to explain, a song that made me buy the record. Hard to explain has simple bar chord structure but fast catchy lyrics. the lead singer julian casablanca's does have a quiet monotonous voice, but it goes with his lyrics that are sung at his leisureand it actually sounds like he is drunk. Plus there is not that much emotion in every song because this record is not an over dramatic cry baby cd. However there is emotion filled soma.Bottom line this cd is great it is simple but catchy and who needs long drama and agony to listen to, (have u heard about pearl jam lately?). This cd is not mainstream rock, this is underground New York, this hopefully is the new rock."
1,all the young dudes,"How could so many people regard those lads as the saviours of rock and roll?Does it need to be saved at all?There is much more interesting music that branched off rock'n'roll anyway.Look beyond the messy hairstyles,the unironed shirts with loose neckties and ripped converse's.The prep school drop-out image is getting so worn out.There is a huge wave of manufactured rock bands for the past few years and The Strokes were among the first successful breakthrough's.After three albums, the sound has barely evolved, and it doesn't even rock,with couple of exceptions.What pisses me off the most is when they are compared with The Libertines, perhaps the only important act that came out of the alleged punk revival thing.The Libertines had Pete Doherty, hence the substance, they carry a message.Not to mention that their rough sound is so catchy and authentic.Work on your taste,don't believe the industry."
1,America enjoys talentlessness.....,"How does a band with no talent get so big? The music on this CD is so unoriginal, repetitive, and boring and the vocalist sounds terrible. MTV needs to stop supporting bands that don't put any hard work and emotion into their music and start showing off bands with actual talent."
1,Stroke,"A poem for the consumer:stroke, stroke, stroke your egobuild yourself some hypethen release a crappy albumfor people with white belts and stupid greasy hair and tight jeans and anyone who ever wanted to be a 'rock star.'please make some real music, hippies."
2,The most overrated album of the 21st century so far,"This is mediocre rock'n'roll. Nothing particularly great about it in any way. It will remain one of the mysteries of live how this group and this album got so hyped up. (I've never seen them live, maybe their live shows have got something that NYC critics picked up on. But on the basis of this recording?? Feh!)"
2,The Title Certainly Fits,"This is what the Hype was for?Very Few highlights on this record, nothing all that interesting. Sounds too much like they're trying to a VU cover band.Try the White Stripes."
4,Hype? What hype? The hype-criers are way off.,"It's very, very simple, folks. This is a good, tight band with guitar chops, and strong songs brimming with old-fashioned rock and roll joy. I hadn't heard a WORD about them in the media; then someone played ""Is This It,"" for me, and my head was bobbing like those doggies with spring heads lolling on dashboards.You can name their parentage if you want: VU, Iggy Pop, etc, etc, but who doesn't have parents? Was Dylan criticized for revering Guthrie? U2 played Bay City Rollers covers when they began, for crying out loud.There have always been nay-sayers who cry ""hype"" whenever someone gets attention, and as soon as it's popular, someone has ""sold out"" and it's not cool to listen to. Hasn't this elitism been properly skewered in ""High Fidelity?"" If it's good, listen to it, but quit fretting about all the tangential issues that have nothing to do with what's pounding out of the speakers.It's good stuff. Try it."
4,Yes this cd is it,this band has great potential.I would have to compare them to the band who was also out of NYC back in the 60s The Velvet Underground. The strokes bring on a new sound poprock with some punk rock and a little ska in it also when i say punk i mean the clash and ramones not the new emo punk. I love the sound of these guys . the album is repitive but in a good way to let u know what there sound is i think u will see a lot from these guys. Buy this album it is great !!!
3,Different Strokes?,"Maybe not...but i've never understood why some people are so passionately opposed to something they have no control over. Music is cyclical. Artists feed off of their predecessors everyday.""This is it"" is a great driving album. The lyrics are par for the genre and this album gives me a legitimate alternative to ""transformer,"" ""New York,"" et al."
4,"Simple rock, beautifully executed","To say that The Strokes are the second coming of rock is a drastic overstatement. However, ""Is This It"" is certainly a breath of fresh air in the pop market.""Is This It"" is not earth-shattering in any way, nor is it incredibly revolutionary or thought-provoking. But, unlike many acts today, The Strokes provide easy, fun rock. This record isn't ambitious, but it does exactly what it sets out to do.The title track sets the pace for the entire album--a rolling, simple drum beat, an easy as pie (and just as enjoyable) guitar riff, and a dancing, almost goofy bass line. Top that off with a lead singer who sounds like he's on the phone because he was too lazy to come to practice, and you have The Strokes.You won't find the meaning of life in this album. You will, however, enjoy yourself. All I can say is that The Strokes have ""it."" What more do you need?"
4,whoa there!,"I think Alex made an interesting point, but maybe we're overlooking that fact that this possibly was The Strokes' intention. I would not, however, go as low as saying that they're as bad as pop. In my mind, ""Last Nite"" is better than anything Ms. Spears could manage. I don't know, I guess I think The Strokes are a fun, retro-type band. But I mean, like whatever you want to like. Music is made to be enjoyed, not picked apart by critics. So how about you shut up and turn up the volume? :)"
3,Not bad,"""Is This It"" is definitely a refreshing change from the vapid stuff that's so popular these days. I must admit though, I haven't been as taken with the Strokes as I am with the White Stripes. The Strokes lack the raw emotional energy of the Stripes. Although that's probably not a fair comparison, since raw emotion isn't really what the Strokes are about.The songs could use a little more complexity, a little less repetition of chords. And ""Last Nite"" is almost directly lifted from Tom Petty's ""American Girl"". Listen to each song one after the other, the similarity is astounding.I do feel that the Strokes are on to something, with their back to basics retro sound and their often ironic lyrics.Let's see what they come up with next..."
1,"Is This It? Yes, I'm Afraid So","The Strokes ""Is This It"" is vastly overrated. They are entirely derivative, but offer nothing even slightly new or interesting. To compare them to the Velvet Underground is an insult to that great band. The Strokes lack the kind of gritty edge and fantastic musicianship that defined the V.U., not to mention range of songwriting (the V.U. could also write beautifully melodic songs like ""I'll Be Your Mirror,"" ""Sunday Morning,"" etc.) ""Is This It"" is really monotonous."
1,5 Stars !!!!,"Yeah this is a 5 star album by a cover band. But since this is not VH1's ""Coverwars"" they get the real world: 1 star. Why? No real ground is broken, the songs are sung in a whiny spoiled brat way about what they experienced while ""slumming"" that weekend. Boring!!!Do yourself a favor and pick up Television's ""Marquee Moon"" and you will see what a real band can do without distortion and you will also realize why The Strokes should be named The Hoax."
2,nothing new,"Is this it? Is the appropriately named debut Album from the strokes. Appropriate, because after all the hype you would have expected something a bit more invigorating really.Look up television, Iggy pop, gang of four, Richard Hell and the velevet underground because the strokes rip off all of the afore mentioned bands while adding a bit more production to make it more accessible to today's music consumer.How can any self respecting punk rock band form after meeting at boarding school in Switzerland? Punk rock and wealth just don't make sense and the bands mentioned earlier thrived on being outsiders and creating music that came from the pain and suffering experienced as a result. No, the strokes are punk rock for the new millennium. A well packaged, well produced group that will sell millions but will never be as good as the original."
2,Give me a break!,"Y'know, no matter how often rock critics mention The Strokes in the same breath as the MC5, The Stooges, The Kinks, or Television, I just can't get over how unbelievably wimpy this band is. Honestly, they have much more in common with Phil Collins or Bread. This is sleepy time college rock for those who want something just slightly heavier than Belle and Sebastian.Those who bought this album also shopped for NyQuil."
5,"In the end, great music.","Though it seems like people have picked and picked at The Strokes, I simply think that after a listen, one will forget about the hype and just love the music. It has some awesome songs, like ""Soma"" and ""Someday"". Appreciate the music, because it is wonderful music"
3,Average,"I'm not sure why some people thought The Strokes were going to be the next best thing in the music scene. I just heard of them through friends, and I decided to give the cd a listen. The first 4 or 5 songs completely blended together and I couldn't tell them apart. The second half of the cd struck me as more unique, but when I was done listening (it didn't take long, only 35 minutes), I didn't feel as if The Strokes were anything special. Some of the songs (i.e., ""Alone Together"", ""Last Nite"", and ""Trying My Luck"") are fun, but nothing more. The Strokes are just an average band experiencing their moment of fame."
2,"if this is NY rock, they can keep it","Enormous hype succeeded in getting me to buy this CD, but not in getting me to like it. Maybe these guys are great live, but there's little life in this album."
3,"Ten years later, still sounds derivative","I pulled Is This It out for the first time in a long while after seeing that Rolling Stone named it the #2 album of the 2000s, but I had the same reaction I did 10 years ago: It's way too familiar. Hundreds of bands have inspired by The Velvet Underground--it seems as though a new crop surfaces every decade. But I can't think of another band that earned as much critical acclaim as The Strokes while borrowing so liberally from the Velvets. (Actually, Sonic Youth may be an exception, but they're also a far better band.) Julian Casablancas sings like Lou Reed with an adenoid problem, drummer Fabrizio Moretti unsuccessfully mimics the primal beat that Maureen Tucker pioneered, and the songs are simply unmemorable. The irony is that so many better bands that have emerged in the decade since Is This It cite this album as a major inspiration when so little new ground was broken by it."
3,decent condition,I received the CD I ordered within the expected time frame. The back of the CD case is dirty but actual disc is in good condition! thanks
2,Weak & overhyped,"After all the comparisons to other bands I had heard about the Strokes, I eagerly bought this dud. No fire-in-the-belly feel at all. Paint by numbers Velvet Underground wannabes."
1,DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!,"I dont own this album and wouldnt be sucker enough to buy it. Based off the sound of the one single i have heard, I cant even remember the name of it, its so forgettable, the strokes are pure NYC retro garbage. it ust goes to show you the age of most music critics when this record showed up on like every top 10 list for album of the year. If you want to hear this type of music, buy a stooges record or the velvet underground, two truly great bands. The strokes unfortunately are about 30 years behind the times. The strokes are truly the great rock n roll swindle."
3,Velvet Underground cover band.......,"I listened to this ""ground breaking"" CD and my advice is to go out and buy some Velvet Underground and Stooges CDs and cut right to the source."
1,... WITH A TWIST OF PUNK?,"GIVE ME A BREAK ... NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU ALL GIVE THIS CD 5 STARS OR TYPE IN CAPS -- IT JUST WON'T MAKE THIS BAND ANY DIFFERENT THAN THE BOY BANDS OF TODAY. (SORRY N'SYNC AND ALL OTHERS) YES, THEY WERE VERY VERY VERY VERY INFLUENCED BY SOME OF THE BEST BANDS IN MUSIC HISTORY -- BUT WHO HASN'T BEEN? THE ISSUE IS THAT THE STROKES DO NOT HAVING STAYING POWER ... WE HAVE ALL SEEN THIS COME UP BEFORE ... IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME THE NEXT BEST THING COMES AROUND WITH SOME POPPY TUNES THAT APPEAL TO THE MASSES. GIVE CREDIT TO THE BANDS THAT TRULY DESERVE MORE ATTENTION .. THE DONNA'S , THE WARLOCKS, THE YEAH YEAH YEAHS, DETROIT COBRAS, VAX WALLO, MOONEY SUZUKI AND OF COURSE SONIC YOUTH -- WHO STILL CAN HOLD IT TOGETHER AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS."
1,Jim Morrison is dead,"I don't own this album but I played the audio clips. That was enough of the Strokes that I will ever care to hear. Look, if I wanted 80s music, I would play 80s music. If I wanted to hear Jim Morrison sing, I would buy a Doors album. These rich boys have no talent and you should have zero respect for those who write shining reviews about this album. If you want good new music, look to Radiohead, Squarepusher, Autechre, and Aphex Twin. If you want to lie to yourself about this band... go ahead. I'm just not going to do it."
1,"No, It Ain't","I bought this on the strength of moist rock-writer reviews - why do I continue to remake this mistake ('cuz every now and then, the idjits are accidentally correct!)? This time, disappointment.Derivative. Sounds like a hundred other nineties/aughties bands who are *oh* so disaffected. Maybe it's just me getting old, but I don't find anything remotely original anymore in twenty-something unhappiness. Tell me something good, or if it's bad, then don't be wishy-washy- *own* it; *mean* it! I can hear this stuff at any shopping-mall penny fountain in america an hour after school's out.I further suspect the ""creative forces"" in the group were all too ready to compromise in the studio in order to be the next STP - ""allright, which of you wants to be the addict?"""
2,The Saviors of rock?... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!,"To call The Strokes the saviors of rock is rediculous. Granted some of the songs are catchy, i.e. ""Last Night"". But this band is anything but talented. Many of the songs have at most 4 cords. COME ON... FOUR CHORDS! ""Hard to explain"" has one or two chords in the ENTIRE song! Until the ""saviors of rock"" can be less predictable, then the state of rock and roll will continue to fail."
1,The tunes ...,are great for radioplay and a little head bobbing here and there. BUT to draw any conclusion that these kids have or will ever come close the talents they have so blatantly ripped off -- The Velvets and the Stooges -- is a travesty.Go to the real artist for some real music full of imagination and amazing orchestration.
1,the strokes review,ok i think this band from the first was overated big time...i do admit i have about half of their songs downloaded from winmx and i do admit some of the songs are decent enough to jam to when you are high.i think the vines is alot better band ..and their songs do sound the same and can be boring to the ear..and the vocals of that front man that looks like a bloated guppy fish from south america can get anoying but hey i gave it 1 start that means i like it a bit...if i didnt give it any stars that means i hate it and we wouldnt be here talking .(laughs).anyways go at your own risk buying this album...and i rcommend that you listen to it first before you buy and im not looking forward to their next realeas..BUT ! i do like the name of the songs i think they are great and that is probably why i listen to it from download..now i didnt buy it so...
3,Is this it? We'll have to wait and see...,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? I've listened to the album a couple times already, and it isn't all that bad. Unfortunately, there's nothing to write home about it either. Minimalist guitar chords and basic melodies are all that come to my mind. Their music could use some more depth. Very reminiscent of Television and VU to say the least. Still, it IS somewhat catchy and worth a listen. Just don't expect too much."
3,get over it,"If I hear the phrase ""Saviors of rock"" one more time, I think I'll just lean over and puke. You might like this music or you might not, but either way, its just more pop rock that fills the radio and sounds just like everything else, so get over it. Just cause some critics say something doesn't mean its true, and just because you agree with them doesn't mean you're smart or sophisticated or something. Just use your head."
1,come on now..,"garbage. sounds like tom petty at times (who sucks big) and just emotionless punk crapola. its frustrating when bands like this get recognition for music with no substance. luckily, I paid $0 for this piece of salvage. I suggest paying no more than $0."
3,Good album,"This minimalist album has nice two-guitar work, catchy songs, though the mumbled, distorted, monotone singing grates."
5,Thank You!,This band isn't Nirvana but they are paving the way for a new Nirvana to come through the music scene get rid of pop and a new branch of punk thats not quite punk comes through. I would say the sound more like MC5 than Velvet Underground with a raw sound and punchy drums.
2,UGH!,"Let's start off by saying that this has all been done before. the Strokes look, music and style is way overplayed. The music is at best mediocre and they are by no means the saviors of rock and roll. if you can, download this album so as not to waste money on it because there are plenty of other great bands that you could give your money to. in a city like NY these guys are a dime a dozen."
2,"What I feared, and expected","Always trying to find something new and interesting, and with all the accolades this band receives, I decided to give The Strokes a chance. And like so many before, I was left unimpressed.Unlike other reviewers, I fail to see how this band can be considered revolutionary. Uninspired, repetitive, and whiney 3-chord rock was pioneered well before The Strokes came around.High praises demand high performance, and unfortunately, the search for the next great rock band will continue."
2,"boring, boring, boring","I don't read many reviews so I cannot say that the hype ruined this recording for me. Actually, I think it's the truly boring nature of it. Or maybe I'm too old, because I think that I've heard every song before. When I listen to it, I hear The Jam, The Smiths, and Frank Black. Who knows? Maybe blues purists listened to Cream and Led Zeppelin and cringed.Definitely nothing new. Rock'n'roll RIP."
2,Not really It.,"Very much overhyped. They wrote 1, maybe two songs. Very good songs. Every other track is a slight variation. Same tempo, same vocal treatment, same reptitive guitar work. After a couple of tracks, you'll find yourself checking the track sequence and asking yourself....""What the...didn't I just hear that song?"" To their credit, a lot of other bands now sound just like them...Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, etc. Except those groups can play their instruments. 2nd album is a little better. Instead of buying this, just download any song off the CD and listen to it about 12 times in a row. Same listening experience."
1,this must be a joke,"I cannot believe how people are falling over themselves to praise this lame band. After hearing all the comparisons to such greats as the Velvet Underground, the Stooges and Television I was practically salivating to hear the Strokes. Then I had the misfortune of actually buying and listening to them. I can deal with bands that are derivative of their idols but this piece of crap is derivative and BORING. Please don't buy into the hype and waste your money. This is most definitely not ""it"" although there is a rhyming word that is more appropriate."
4,Relax and listen to it,"Finding the perfect comparison band or even the best analogy to describe this CD is ridiculous. Television?! Please, how ludicrous would it be to imitate that? The Strokes may not be innovators and Julian Casablancas (whose dad owns a modeling agency) is an okay singer but nothing fantastic. Even so, these guys are getting the job done and they really do seem to be having fun. Let's face it. Between the robotic teen singers whose backbeats are as droning as the cash registers totalling their receipts to the suburban pseudo-punk that all the kids are groovin' to, there's not much real entertainment out there for people who have actually owned LP's out of necessity.The Strokes have put together a few really nice tunes for the soundtrack to our daily lives. That's something. So, who cares who did it first? They're bratty NYC kids with connections and some musical chops. That is it."
2,"Strokes Good, Frisbee Better","If you like this CD, check out Frisbee, a Chicago band that actually is musical, sings with harmonies, garage band +! The Strokes are getting a lot of hype (just like Velvet Underground did in the 60's), probably becuase they're from new York, but Frisbee already has what The Strokes are striving for."
4,A better Hootie and the Blowfish,"I never heard of most of the bands the people are talking about except for the Rolling Stones. The Strokes CD is almost as good as the lastest Mick Jagger and better than the 2nd Hootie CD and a bit better than the 1st Toad the wet sproket CD. I say they kinda rock in an alternative way, without being too hard and angry like Nirvana. Maybe closer to Lennie Kravat."
2,"nice try, I guess","I heard the strokes before their sudden popularity explosion and I was just as impressed then as I am now. that is to say, very little. it's a fairly bland album, and it's pretty clear not a whole lot of thought went into it. although admittedly it's still better than anything on pop radio today (save maybe coldplay and the new elton john). how much longer until the Gap ad?"
2,Let's be realistic,"This is a gritty little album. All of the tunes are bouncy numbers, leaning more towards Ramones, than Pistols. The lead singer is an Iggy/Jim hybrid, leaning more towards Iggy. Last-nite is a catchy tune, and could be a big hit for them if it gets airplay. The rest of the album gets repetitive. A band such as this, is much better served by EP's, since they wouldn't have to multiply the same garage tune X12. I think they should also cut the length of some of their songs, 4:37 is toooo long for Barely Legal. On another note, not to take away from the music, but I noticed the downplaying by the music press, and the band, of the song NYC cops. The EP was released stateside Sept. 4th , and we all know by now what happened just 7 days later. I wonder how this band feels about their song, after the fact? I don't see them pushing it, do they feel bad? Or do they just lack the balls to take the heat?"
4,rocks you all the way down to the basement,This album rocks. It is brimming with cool songs that rock your a## all the way down to the basement. Whatever that means. Its very accesible without being pandering and silly. Everyone in your family will love it. Grandma Jill. Uncle Steve. Everyone. It would have gotten 5 stars but its not stanky enough. But I guess that is why everyone in your family will like it. Oh well. Just buy it. Its filled with classic tracks. Unfortunately 'New York City Cops' has been removed from the album. It was an awesome song. It's fine. Tracks 4-6 are one of those rare trifectas of bootyliciousness. The rest is good too. Go for it!
1,Why stroke the stokes?,"I first head them before they got all hyped up... and I hatedthem. I don't care whether they are major label or indie labelor their parents bought their cute outfits and gear or theyhustled the streets of New York to buy them... They blatentlyrip off the classic bands that did ""it"" first and did ""it"" waybetter. Just because rock seems to be in a great lull with allthe boring rap core doesn't mean that the first stripped downband with a chic Gap look doesn't mean that it's the greatestthing since sliced bread. Sure, Rolling Stone loves them, but in case you haven't noticed, Rolling Stone loves everything. I don't remember the last real review that magazine gave.Until the new Flaming Lips CD comes out, I'll just continuelistening to hip-hop and jazz."
1,IMAGE ROCK AT ITS WORST,"I can't stand this new breed of image rock bands. What an appalling fad, leaving millions of otherwise knowledgeable music fans deluded. Such fans will wait for their new album with baited breath.. while the strokes are too busy looking 'cool' and ready to collect their paycheck. great marketing... but utter drivel. please avoid. so that when this band are forgotten about in a couple of years you don't have the embarassment of finding their cd in your collection and remembering you were one of the sheep."
3,Everything But Talent!,"These guys have it all. They have genuine rock attitude ala Lou Reed. They look cool. They are a long overdue backlash to the boy band [...junk] that's been crowding the airwaves. They are like some unrehearsed garage band that somehow made its way onto the radio and it is a blast of fresh, unproduced, rock and roll air.But they are missing one crucial element: Talent. Maybe they'll find some along the way, but for now their songs are terrible, they can't play their instruments, and as if that weren't bad enough, they are poorly recorded.Oh well, at least it isn't Britney Spears. If they represent the future of Rock and Roll, I, for one, say it's a welcome change."
4,The Strokes....,"I personally thought it was a great album and don`t see why all you people have to complain about it, but everyone is allowed to share their own opinion, so I am sharing mine.I thought almost all the songs on the album were good.They all had good beats and interesting lyrics.Some of my favorites on the album were,SomedayLast NiteHard To Explainand When It Started.Some of the other songs were not that great but the other songs make-up for it.These guys are original, they even have their own unique(and slightly weird)look, they all pretty much have bed head!I enjoyed the album and think that it was put together pretty good.And I think that it was quite enjoyable."
2,One Good Song,"i consider myself open minded and patient when it comes to new music. these guys have a great, catchy pop single in ""Last Night"", but that's it for this album. the rest of it is awfully boring and forgetable. i hope they make another go of it and come up with some better stuff."
4,a title for my review ;),"not bad. the songs are easy to dismiss on first listen but after a while you'll want to listen to them again and again. and killer basslines are definitely underrated in general.but I'm completely bewildered by the velvet underground comparison. julian casablancas is unfit to sniff lou reed's jockstrap, imho."
5,"Underated, over-hyped.","While so many of the real critics are going ga-ga over this, and many amatuers like me are attacking it or loving it, I stand away from the foolishness.Is This it opens with the title track, and makes it's point, it's semi-laid back garage rock. The Strokes don't lay on the fuzz and hard rock riffs like Mooney Suzuki, or have the Kinksesque sound of the Hives, they insted go for the Velvet Underground type of New York artiness. I do think that the VU sound is highly publicised but not that true. They do have an element of Velvet Undergroundishness, but are all together their own sort of thing.Lyrics are interesting, the sound is interesting, with a laid back glazed eye sort of sound. Sort of like their out on drugs, but not really too out, hard to explain.As always, listen to the CD."
2,i like the strokes because they are cool.,"this album is a joke. reviewer courtney hinton hit it rite on. these guys are a cover bad, a novelty act like tenacious d, except the d basks in their novelty fame. i would differ in the opinion that critics embrace this album because of the nostalgia factor. i'm pretty sure most critics have never actually listened to a lou reed, television, iggy pop, stooges album, but they sure know what they sound like."
3,Don't believe the hype,"the strokes...another victim of media hype. the PR guy should have done some damgage control. this album can never be a great album for me because of all the buzz around it. my favorite albums have always been those that i've stumbled upon silently. still, this is a strong 3 star album. when i first heard 'barely legal', i felt a youthful excitement about ROCK. that's something i haven't felt in a really long time. pure fun. the songs are catchy and as simple as a straight line from point a to b. for the numerous gems in this brief album, i recommend it."
1,it's a sad day for rock and roll...,"...when a band of five completely untalented prep school boys with industry connections (via a rich fashion mogul father) can get rave reviews and become internationally famous for poorly and unenthusiastically aping the styles of good bands from 30 years ago. these kids are not rock and roll. these kids wouldn't know rock and roll if it was dropped on their heads. what has happened to us that our expectations are this low? everyone says ""well they're not original, and they won't change your life, but they play good rock and roll."" well, i can think of tons of bands that make a lot less money and get a lot less attention that ARE original and that COULD change your life. the ONLY reason anyone knows who these bourgeois jerks are is that one of them has a rich, connected daddy. period. mediocre to poor all around. let's hope they all die of drug overdoses soon."
3,Decent but not essential,"The Strokes are NOT the saviors of rock and roll, repeat NOT. This disc is decent to be sure but the vocal technique is pretty grating and most of the songs never really take off. With the exception of two fine, bouncy numbers, ""Someday"" and ""Last Nite"", Is This It just isn't all that exceptional. For the most part, the rest of the disc just runs together, with one cut being about the same as the next. Not a bad effort but anyone looking for garage rock thrills can do better than this."
3,Sensational? Nah.,"People keep saying this is a rebirth of the sound of the 70s underground in New York. In truth, there's very little of that - really it sounds more like New Order filtered through Pavement's guitars with Mo Tucker filling in on drums. In response to two of the most name-dropped comparisons, there's no more New York-era Stooges in here than any other indie band, and you really have to struggle to hear any Blondie in this. The reality is that the Strokes' snowball would not have tumbled so quickly had this band come out of the midwest. Their surrounding sensationalism is really more of a reflection of the incestuous rock n' roll press. When did rock critics and magazine hype become viable measures of quality? Has all suspicion of corporate rock withered with the 21st century? There's certainly nothing rock n' roll or underground about that."
1,Resurect 60's & 70's Punk and do it again!!!!,"I liked the Strokes when they were the Stooges. Do yourself a favor and buy Funhouse instead (im sure the strokes themselves have listened to it alot). Its much more innovative and well basiclly their whole sound and look. Hey even the video is reminiscent of the early 70's. With Iggy Pop, i mean the strokes lead singer doing his best Iggy Pop impersination.When anything is copied it can never match the original. Its fine if the Strokes want to do this kind of music but shame on the music industry for promoting and showing it on MTV all the time. There are too many exciting and innovative bands that are going overlooked."
5,Strokes - Is This IT,"I cannot believe the average review of this album is 3.5 stars! If, hopefully when, you listen to the album you'll realize how good it is. 'The Modern Age,' 'Someday,' 'Last Nite,' and 'Soma' are the highlights, among so many great songs. Just listen to the album and you'll love it, unless of course you have no taste in music--or like new metal--hell those two things similar..."
5,addictive cd,"I love this cd!! I have been listening to it nonstop since I got it!! It reminds me of the music I listened to on Vassar College radio in high school. In a weird way, some of the riffs on the slower songs remind me of Joy Division (for example, the song ""Hard to Explain""). Other songs remind me of old songs from The Fall. But other than that, it's hard to pin them down. Every song on this CD is as good as the next! It rocks."
5,Best album of 2001,This is the best album I have ever heard. There are no weaks songs on is this it. The best song in my opinion is the modern age. This cd makes a joke out of the white stripes elephant and the yeah yeah yeahs fever to tell. It is way better than all the garbo on the radio today like fitty cent eh homie. i see all these nerds walkin around with the erkel look (there pants tucked in there socks) there always a white guy too. This is way better than all that [junk].
5,Finally,"Finally there is a band that isn't afraid to sound ""Dirty"", The Strokes give you up-front Rock with no gimmicks or studio tricks. They have finally brought back the true meaning of Sex, Drugs & Rock n' Roll. Music sounds so computerized these days with a handful of exceptions. The Strokes bring raw talent in this album and it sounds that there will be a bright future for these guys."
3,Average,"Despite all the hype, the glowing reviews, and multiple listens, I find this to be an average ""album"" with only two or three above average songs to carry the load."
2,IS this it?,another example of posturing music 'editors' who cream themselves over anything that sounds remotely like Velvet Underground.
5,"You will be satisfied, buy it","This is an amazing album. It's so simple, but it is really good. I've only been playing the guitar for a few months and I can already play some of the songs on it. Some of the music reminds of 50s and 60s stuff mixed with the white stripes and radiohead. I cant mention any stand out tracks because they are all really good."
4,Not going to hear naything like this on the radio,"Ok whether you pay attention to the media hype or not, this a great album. I have yet to meet anyone that can really discribe the sound, all I know is that this whole album is a good listen. THey sound out of the 60's at some times, and straight out of the mid 90's at others. But you have to love this album even if it simply is something different. In an era of Nickelback's and Creed's this band is actually ariginal (gasp!). So for all the music snobs who don't think this is original, go away, cause the pool of music you choose from is limited. So for people with open tastes and who are tired of the stuff on the radio, I urge you to get this ablum."
2,Please let this be it....,"I bought this cause my dj friend said that he enjoyed it in spite of all the hype. I regret that I listened to him, and I wish that I had spent my money on something more worthwhile. The whole album sounded the same - just a bunch of catchy, pop tunes with nothing new or interesting to offer. The DB's did pretty much the same stuff years ago, and they did it a whole lot better.Maybe in a few years the Strokes might produce something interesting, but they aren't anything special at the moment.My advice to them is that they should invest the money they make from this vapid effort very wisely....If they continue in this vein, they may well be a one CD wonder."
4,Take a chance on this one,"I loved Coyle's last book, In Troubled Waters, which manages to be about race, aging, Alzheimer's and relationships without losing the reader in a packed plot. But Taken In is a better book, with strong writing, dead-on characterizations and a simplier, more compact -- and, thus, more engaging -- plot. There is a twist about halfway through the book that takes your breathe away, and makes you realize that all is not what it seems, in the book, in our world, and especially in our relationships with family, neighbors and strangers."
3,Forgettable,"Unmistakebly Wodehouse, but not up to the standards of the Wooster, Psmith, or golf stories. With the exception of the supernatural (and quite remarkable) story Honeysuckle Cottage, it's all forgettable. Entertaining, but forgettable."
2,Only Part 1,"This Poorly put together Dvd includes part 1 of the competition, which is totally unsatisfying. One would think that the purpose for watching the competition would be to see who wins. Only One round and some interviews are included in this dvd. A complete and total waste of money...blah"
3,Akin to watching porn,"At first glimps this was akin to watching strippers. The ""dancers"" were humping the floor at a furious pace and slamming down into the splits to hump the ground some more. Lots of weird shimmys, as a Belly Dancer I found interesting. It must have been morbid fasination that kept me watching. I found myself rooting for the girls I liked to win. And of course I realize how athletic they are to be able to ""dance"" like that. In the end I did appreciate this new-to-me dance form. Or maby I can just find the good in any dance."
4,"International Dancehall Queen, Vol. 5","Okay, the thing with these tapes is that they break them up into 2 or more parts. Part 2 isn't available so you don't end up seeing who wins the competition. Other than that it was interesting and entertaining."
3,Great idea but...,"I bought this toy for my four year old son, it worked great right out of the box...for about an hour. My son had difficulty winding the train up and because of this he would accidentally wind it backwards, which ended up breaking the train in no time flat. This toy while working did bring a big smile to his face and he giggled while watching Thomas cross over the bridge, I just wish the train had been made differently, maybe a push and go or something a bit easier to use for 3 years and up."
5,What a lifesaver!!,My 3 year old son plays with this take a long thomas set in the car...everywhere we go ..he has to take it along with him. This toy is a total lifesaver for long trips and even the short trips....keeps him entertained for hours!!
2,It's okay.,"We got this toy as a gift. It's okay. On car trips and long waiting periods, it holds the attention for a very brief period. I think it's better for a shorter wait period, like the doctor's office.My main issue with it is that it just misses the boat on just about every front. The little Thomas needs pretty good fine motor skills to wind it independantly for a child, and by the time they have these, the kids are really too old for the toy. While it's pretty sturdy, there are smallish parts that can easily get lost that will make the toy unusable. If you are using something for travel, you don't want losable small parts.For the age group this is for, you are better off getting them a new train for the cost and giving them a pad of paper to draw a line on (a track) and let them do that for awhile for travel. It will give you more independance and work much better."
4,My 2-year old loves it!,"My son got this as a gift and it has been a life-saver in restaurants and airplane rides. It comes with a handful of little pieces, fences, trees, horses but I took these things out. I was tired of picking them up off the floor and in between cushions. If your child loves trains, this is a toy for them. Don't think, however, that this is something that keeps them entertained throughout an entire meal (I doubt much does), but it sure helps. A LOT."
4,My son loves this even though the winder broke the first day,I would have given this 5 stars if the winder on the Thomas hadn't broken two hours after we opened it. It must have been a faulty train because I am the only one who was winding it. My son was 2 1/2 and it was too hard for him to do himself. I'm glad he didn't break it as it would have frustrated him. Despite the train breaking my son has spent hours playing with it and even now comes back to it (we've had this 7 months now). It is easy to put away and set up. This is a good take along train to bring with you without a lot to keep track of.
1,What a disappointment,"There wasn't one song, including stranger, that I liked. I expected selections similar to the album one love and emotional. I wanted those kinds of songs and I didn't get it. The songs seemed empty and quickly put together. Nothing different in the melodies. This CD goes on the back shelf. I am still a fan just not of this album."
5,emotional,"I knew Jeffrey Osborne's new CD would be great. When I watched him in concert at Bally's Casino here in New Orleans, I was so touched. To hear him perform ""Rest of our life"" in person, all I could do is cry. His voice is the only one that make me happy when I am blue, I have added this CD to my collection to make me happy. Whenever he is in New Orleans,I try to make it my business to see him. I was probably conceived from his earlier songs, both my mother and father love him. My ex-boyfriend from back in the day, would sing me LTD songs. If my husband and I had kids, they would also be Jeffrey Osborne fans. Thank you Mr. Osborne for touching my heart for the past 32 years."
1,Wanted More,"I love his voice and I just expected more songs, that I could hear the range. It is a cool remake of one of his longtime hits on this album though, loved that one."
3,"Interesting information, but it gets old","This book was interesting and had some good information in it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to read a book on Starbucks and Nike. I found myself dreading another story about how wonderful Starbucks or Nike are, and how great a manager the author was. It really starts to get old.The principles are good, but you can read about most of them in any college marketing textbook."
4,Worth reading for Brand marketers,This is a good book and since many books in this subject are not worth reading at all. There are only a handful of good ones. I also like 60-minute Brand Strategist by Idris Mootee and they basically talk about the same thing. One is more light reading.
1,horrible cd,"people save your money and do not listen to this junk a frien of mine told me i would really like this cd because they sound like the spice girls however these two girls cannot sing they sound horrible and not to mention they fact that thet keep preaching theie faith to people it one thing like the spice girls to shout girl power to achieve equality for girls howver these two girls are only trying to ram religion down your throat so unless you our christian stay away from this cd, it just another plow by christians that they our right and everyone else is wrong have we not learned enough with this kind of thinking gets you after all the recent tragedies in the world Please V-enna keep your faith to yourself because nobody wants to hear about how you feel your faith is beeter than everyone else faith or lack of faith."
5,Awsome Job,These girls have an awsome sound a beat. They are catchy and get their message accross effectivatly. They did a wonderful job and I can't wait for their next realease.
5,Bernina 1530,This is a fascinating book and while it does not apply directly to the Bernina 1530 it has a tremendous amount of challenging projects that I would never have thought of. If I were to own a later model Bernina I would definitely want this book. The information is not supplied with the machines.
3,"Not for New Bernina,s",If I would have known this was for much older machines I would not have ordered it. I was looking for newer machine information.
2,Puh-leese!!!,"Okay, ordinarily, I think Jeph Loeb is one of the finest scribes in comics. I think his Batman stories with Tim Sale (as well as A Superman for All Seasons) are comic storytelling at its finest. He also scaled new heights with the Hush storyline with Jim Lee. Add to that his work on Superman/Batman and I found myself truly enjoying slam bang superhero stories.But this was too much. Okay, Kara Zor-el is Krypton's last daughter. I'll buy that. But when she can find her way into the Batcave without Batman detecting her? Short answer. No way. The idea of a rookie getting the drop on the Batman is completely unacceptable. Given Batman's combat experience, I've no doubt he has a plan already in place to take out Supergirl in case she goes rogue so I figure if she tried to get into the cave, he'd be ready.Ian Churchill of course does his usual good work. It's too bad that Loeb's script was unusually weak."
1,Horrible,"Here's a potential good character given nothing to do in a horrible story. It makes no sense, has no supporting cast, nor any story arch. Supergirl has no personality. DC should have stuck with Peter David's Supergirl or at least come up with an idea of what to do with the ""new"" (or is it original?) Supergirl. This collection shows a complete lack of direction. The arts alright, however."
3,Not that bad.,"I'll be the first to admit it isnt the best arc ever written. The whole ""new girl on a new planet she doesnt know"" angle gets beaten to death and becomes quite predictable. However the art is very good and The sotry has some depth, which is more than one may say about a lot of comics out there. Over all its a good read, not a great one, but a good one and most importantly for me, it didnt bore. The effect of black kryptonite was a suprise for me which wasnt expected And the revamping of the characters origin by making her originally older than Kal and then finding herself to be youger than him was quite refreshing.I bought the individual comics and am planning on buying the paperback."
4,here she is,"This incarnation of Supergirl was introduced in the Batman/Superman series. And this collection is really where she (sort of) comes in to her own. She learns a bit about herself, and really, teen angst on a superhuman level, it can get interesting."
5,Good planes,"While the barrel roll feature does kind of take away from the toy, this can be fixed with some ingenuity. The whol plane is a great addition to the G.I. Joe line with the cool design and excellent bomb dropping trigger. I myself took out the batteries. Another great thing about this toy is the figure Ace that comes with it. It is an excellent figure and this is a great toy."
4,to much jazz,this jet is one of the best small jets to come out. nothing really to brake unlike the x-14 windshild tabs that brake if your breath hits it the wrong way. the bomb drop is great but the little spin button on the back---- to far. come on hasbro u dont need stuff like that to sell G I Joes. most of us would have like it with out it. i fixed it with some glue and a nail but thats me. let the kids <adults> use there minds toys should be like a book not movie dont tell them what to do just let them do there own thing. thats why gi joe failed in the 90's to much spring loaded garbage and neon colors. but ace in this one is great it is a good 10 dollar toy
5,Worth while for the price,"I, myself, liked the toy. My 5 year old LOVES it. He was pretty much inseperable from it the first few days. Yes, the plane's barrel roll turns a bit too easily, but the overall effect made it more fun. There are ways to hold onto it so it doesn't roll. The action figure was pretty cool looking too. According to all his friends, it's a pretty awesome toy and very popular with them to the point of having to split up individual time to avoid confrontation. I'd say the kids have the final vote, don't you think?"
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I first saw this toy, along with the Cobra Night Adder, on TV and thought that these look like two of the better vehicles Hasbro has made in a while. However, when I received them, I was disapointed. The Tiger Hawk has a tail section that rotates when you push a button. This is susposed to make the plane do a ""barrel roll"". Instead of just making the toy with out this feature, Hasbro instead (in my opinion) ruined the toy. I have collected GI JOE toys since they first came out. I love the real looking vehicles and planes. But these ""extra"" features ruin an other wise excellent toy. Hopefully Hasbro in the future will do away with these ""triggers"" and ""handles"" and allow the collector to enjoy the toy. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Dr. O. C. Makes Spiritual Principles Practical,"Dr. O. C. Smith, following the method in which the Greats have taught Truth Principles, gives the reader a practical book that can change the way in which they see themselves in the world they live in. Dr. O. C.'s consuming interest in teaching metaphysical principles to help people find their own solutions and solve their own problems is clearly evident in this book. A student of Dr. Joseph Murphy, Dr. Frank Richelieu and other Masters of Metaphysics, Dr. O. C. clearly has taken their teachings and expanded on the wisdom that he received from them. A Minister of Religious Science, Dr. O. C. takes the reader to a level beyond traditional Christian theology and truly connects the reader with the Power and the Presence of God that In-Dwells them! This book is from a consciousness of accomplishment and achievement and Dr. O. C. freely shares his great wisdom with the reader ... Dr. O. C. knew the Truth and demonstrated It abundantly!"
4,Corrected Track Listing for this CD,"This item is a very rare out of print import only release from 1988. The correct tracks are;1. September 3:362. Evil Roy (12"" Mix) 5:283. Let's Groove 5:364. Boogie Wonderland 9:215. System of Survival 7:347. Fantasy 4:366. Serpentine Fire 3:518. Jupiter 3:119. Magnetic (Extended Dance Remix) 6:22"
3,Heard Better,"Heston's reading of the old man and the sea is so-so, he did a much better job on the snows."
2,What is all the fuss about?????,"I simply don't understand what all the fuss about Hemingway is about. I know the man was mad and killed himself but I remember reading an interview with him where her said something to the effect :""I write sloppy but people seem to like it"" and man if that ain't the truth! There is NOTHING special about his writings! I could have written them. I only give it 2 stars because ""The Old Man and the sea"" were somewhat entertaining. I understand how symbolysm can be pulled out of the stories but that is the case with any story written so simplistically."
5,Beautiful women kicking butt...does it get any better?,Love it as it highlights the sexy legendary ladies of the martial arts. This tribute flick features numerous clips from the movies that made these incredibly skilled women famous. A must buy for every martial arts fan! Just sit back and enjoy while these girls kick the baddies around with expert precision. You also get to learn some great history about females in the martial arts. After watching this documentary you will definitely have a new found respect for these deadly dolls as they show their male counter-parts a thing or two!
1,Top fighter 2 (NFG),This is not an action flick. It is a documentary of very poor quality and is definitely outdated. Do Not buy it.
3,Used for bicycles,"A little steep in price. One switch, on-off. Lights come on with the pumping. My last pump, at 1/2 the price, had more options and a nice automatic shut off. Maybe this one is built to last!"
5,Fresh Take on Classic Jazz,"You'll want to loop this cd on your player because one listen is not enough! Double Life organically flows between memorable rhythms and moody spaces. It delivers a fresh take on classic jazz and has become a ""frequently played"" disc in my collection. Check it out!"
4,Fine Player Worth Listening to...,"Not a player that overplays - -this gentleman plays with tasteful discretion. You can tell he has more in his arsenal, but he chooses to say what has to say very succintly. Deserves a national contract. DV from Texas"
5,This collection far exceeded my expectations.,"I've been a huge fan of Republic Pictures serials for many years and was thrilled to discover this collection. James King and the CinemaSound Orchestra have captured the pulse pounding tempo of those classic Republic Serials perfectly!!! The music brought back fond memories of watching Commando Cody (The Rocket-Man), the Masked Marvel and all the rest. If you are a Republic Serial fan or just love great motion picture music, this CD is a must have for your collection."
5,Show Stealers,Caught Hunters & Collectors in Dallas as the openers for Midnight Oil in '92. I was impressed as much if not more with the show and sounds they put on as the Oils. A great sound from start to finish. Well worth the time to experience a lesser known band from The Land Down Under!
2,Not Worth My Time or Money,"This is really nothing more than some guy playing through a scale book. (But it's not even a very good one, as all the scales are only one octave, and he doesn't show how the scales should actually be played, practiced, how they fit into the context of the fret board... he just mechanically goes through them; up one octave and down again.) I was also hoping to get a little more info on the exotic scales but he just rushes through, to fit them all in, at the very end... and then come the advertisements to sell you more stuff (which beefs up the video duration stats). This was a waste of my time and money."
2,Tony Ja Fan,If you are a Tony Ja fan then get this for your collection. If you like martial arts action films by any artist. Then forget it.
2,tony jaa ?,the condition of the product was good but it was in subtitled english if you don't mind thatalso it was not really a good film like sorta b quality for martial arts but Item came quik and in good condition and played well
1,Three Movies Renowned For Their Terribleness,"I just watched these three, or I should say parts of them. I was hoping to see some interesting Thai culture in the background even if the movie was no good but no. There is some bizarre made-up pretend voodoo rituals and even wierder zombification rituals, but they aren't interesting, they seem to have been concocted by fifth graders. Then there are lots of Thai folks running around in open woods and fields chasing each other and being chased by zombies. The scenes could just as well have been in Alabama for all the Thai culture there is. There is essentially no plot or character in any of these, they aren't so bad that they're good, and I really wonder if they weren't all arranged and directed, written and edited by some rich fifth grader for a grade school project."
4,"Legend soundtrack = ""fine fantasy RPG music""","As an AD&D Dungeon Master and player, in my opinion, track 3,4,7, and the reprise at 11 are great theme music for when the PCs visit a far-off magical fairy lands. Some of the other tracks are darker and more forbidding, good for enhancing gameplay and mood in underground dungeon situations."
5,Incredible!,"I saw this movie years ago in the US version, Tangerine Dream. I have to say, I loved it then, and after seeing the directors cut, I love the music and the movie even more! I heard the other soundtrack by Jerry G (I think). Keeping w/ the theme of the movie that one added a good feel. But I guess Im just biased towards this one since I heard it first. I cant even watch the movie w/ the other soundtrack. Awesome music to go along w/ an awesome movie!"
4,powerful and moving,"This is one soundtrack that I have not gotten tired of. While listening to it one can easily recall the gracefull movents of the dance, and when the unicorns first appeared. It remains one of my favorite titles."
4,Outstanding song...,"""Loved by the Sun"" stood out the first time I saw this movie, (back in grade school). I would rewind the movie just to hear the song over again and again. Needless to say, I have purchased both the movie and the soundtrack now (money well spent). Unlike the other reviewers (sorry guys), I don't care for score's. I had to have this for Jon Anderson's song only! Bryan Ferry's song is good too, but I have that on 9 1/2 Weeks soundtrack."
3,Definitely takes some getting used to.,"It's an ok cd, not all that amazing. I was expecting better. But It's been growing on me the more I listen. The only thing on it that I truly despise is ""Loved By the Sun"" - just plain irritating. Makes my nerves stand on edge. But it's only one song, so it doesn't ruin the whole cd."
5,A Magical Soundtrack,"I have over 1000 cds in my collection but only one soundtrack, and this is it! The music is from the excellent movie Legend which was re-released on DVD a few years ago with an extra musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. But I still prefer this score by Tangerine Dream. My favorite tracks are Cottage (beautiful melody), Loved By The Sun (featuring Jon Anderson from Yes), Darkness (haunting), and the excellent ballad Is Your Love Strongh Enough? featuring Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music) on vocals and David Gilmour (Pink Floyd) on guitar. Get this cd, find a comfortable place, and enter the magical world of Legend."
4,Pick Up The Pieces,"When Jerry Goldsmith's original orchestral score fell horribly flat in test screenings, Tangerine Dream entered the picture to put together this movie soundtrack.But there are a few twists in the 11 tracks, with the intriguing gem being Bryan Ferry's (with David Gilmour) Is Your Love Strong Enough?, which was an outtake from the recording sessions for the album Avalon by Roxy Music. The Unicorn Theme is given a vocal rendition by Jon Anderson in Loved By The Sun, with his part added after TD composed the original piece.Edgar Froese, Christopher Franke and Johannes Schmoelling picked up the pieces and proved up to the task while battling a tight deadline, though most collectors seek the album out for Ferry's track."
4,U.S. Release,"Personally, I think that this is a timeless movie. And the soundtrack to go along with it, the same. Although, this is the U.S. release of the soundtrack. The Import version contains an entirely different line-up. The Import versions songs are as follows:Main Title/The Gobblins (not my spelling!)My True Love's EyesThe UnicornsLiving River/ Bumps and HollowsThe Fairies/ The RiddleSing the WeeForgive MeFaerie DanceThe ArmourOona/ The JewelsThe Dress WaltzDarkness FailsThe RingRe-UnitedI think any fan of the movie should own both versions."
4,"""Is Your Love Strong Enough""","The song is also available on iTunes' version of ""More Than This - The Best of Brian Ferry and Roxy Music."" For anyone interested."
2,Amazon should stepp in and do something,"Something should be done by Amazon to regulate persons from price gouging. I spent so many years looking for a particular CD with absolutely no luck. It eventually appeared on amazon for the price of $95 not including shipping. I had come into some money at the time, so I broke down and purchased it. I was certain that it was my only chance to ever own this CD again. Months later, I noticed it being sold by the same person for $19.95. Needless to say, I was pissed off. This kind of practice should be completely stopped. As far as Legend, this movie and it's music made an impact on me, so I was excited to buy it. I saw the price, and this time I decided not to be such a sucker. I went to my friend's house who basically went on a music sharing site that you pay a small fee of 10 cents per song, found the sounds, downloaded them, and then burned them onto a CD for me in the exact order that the songs appear on the original soundtrack."
2,"a disappointing soundtrack, very 1970s in style","I bought this album while compiling a collection of fantasy-film soundtracks. I admit I had not seen the film for some time and I couldn't bring to mind the soundtrack. Legend was a good film, an interesting fairytale story. That it is not remebered is at least in part due to the soundtrack. It lacks any of the powerful themes which rouse a listener, and which stay with you afterwards (cf Conan the Barbarian by Basil Poledouris)."
2,Makes your ears bleed,"Well, perhaps that's a bit dramatic however ""Loved By the Sun"" can cause serious pain. How anyone can say that song is even decent is beyond me. The music is cheap, silly and false. There is no depth of emotion, the only thing worth keeping is ""The Dance."""
1,I can not believe.,Are you telling the truth? I do not understand how you folks can say that TD is better than Goldsmith's work. These artificial instruments can not face the explosion of a good orchestra.Think better. That's all I ask.
4,Intregal part of the movie,"There is some debate about the inclusion of Tangerine Dream's score to Legend over Jerry Goldsmith's. I have heard both and I must say that Tangerine Dream's is far superior in context. I tried to imagine just how the movie would be without Tangerine Dream's score and realized just how intregal it is. The music is extremely atmospheric, bringing the story to the lofty ethereal height required for a fantasy film. Jerry Goldsmith's score, although good, is too grounded in reality. The Tangerine Dream score gives the film its character."
2,The final battle to save Xavier and the future of the X-Men.,"This is it. The final battle where Bishop travels back in time to the critical point where Legion will kill Professor X. Even if Bishop is successful and saves the Professor's life, will the history of the X-Men still be forever changed? Read and find out."
3,Old time photos,"I have several ancestors who come from Sauk Rapids. I learned about the one I know the least. My German great grandfather, and at least one of his sons is mentioned. Interestingly, there is no details about the French speaking population."
4,Classic Cult Horror Monster Bash,"Well as far as Draculs vs Frankenstien's monster is does not happen , there is a good fight between The Wolf Man & The Mummybasicly you have a pretty freaked out film with alot of cut's and missing dialog?, I seen it first on ""Creature Feature"" it's title then ""Assingment Terror"" in the early 70's and i've been trying to get it since then, I dig this flic because it has all the groovy monsters in one place at on time, and like some ppl who have talked about this movie on different site's I don't hate the Frankenstein Monster's make up but it's still cheesyTHANXThe Epic One"
3,A Little Princess Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,"The soundtrack I would rate as ""Fair"", but it left out 2 music scores that was in the movie. The tune Miss Minchin was playing during the ""reading session"" and the piano score during the birthday party scene. Some of the selections on the CD are too short.The soundtrack doesn't match the quality of the movie."
4,sweet melodies,I love Patrick Doyle music. It soothes and inspire me at the same time. The CD was worth the money and more. I will be listening to this CD for years to come. Great listening for all ages.
5,Finally something that makes giving medicine to cats easier!,"It is almost impossible to give liquid medications to my cats, but with the pipettes it is a lot easier. They are thinner than regular droppers and it can easily be placed at the side of their mouth and done in a quick shot. You have to have a quick solution when giving a cat medicine."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"These are longer then I thought they would be and flimsier. Still, for the price they're a good deal. They don't handle thicker liquids very well. They pick up water quickly, glycerine glacially. On the other hand, they are reusable, so that helps."
5,A must read for entrepreneurs,"This is a fun and quick read. Don't be fooled though, Guy answers a lot of questions that don't get covered in any of the other books on entrepreneurship. For example, what is the appropriate percentage of the company to give to those you invite to be on your board of directors? Or how long should my powerpoint pitch be? These are the kinds of no nonsense problems that Guy explains more clearly than anyone else.This book won't teach you everything you need to know to be successful, but it will teach you things you need to be successful that you won't find anywhere else. For anyone considering starting a business or a non-profit, there will be many books you have to read, and this should be book number one."
3,Overbroad,"I love Guy's books, but this title was trying to be everything to everyone. Good tips inside, but its very broad target dampers the book's effectiveness."
2,Lacks substance. Maxims and Anecdotes galore.,This book feels like the book of Proverbs: it's a bunch of one-liners and anecdotes and there's no prose or flow. I know it's not supposed to be a Harry Potter storybook...but it just doesn't flow well. Too many bullet points and not a lot of substance. Just stories and maxims from this guy.
4,"Good, solid advice on starting a business","A very solid effort for anyone interested in starting a small business. Such wisdom and what time-saving advice. This book says it's a guide for starting ""anything"", I'm not quite sure why he felt it necessary to give that illusion. It's how to start a business. So, I'm sure this book is worth your effort if you are interested in starting a business and hope for even bigger things in the future."
5,Great Motivation,"The Art of the Start is a book that anybody can enjoy.Guy Kawasaki is a Venture Capitalist and brings real worldexperience as he guides readers to visualize, prepare, andstart a business.There are some general rules and suggestions, as well as avery accurate descrition of what a start-up company will gothrough to get venture capital.This book is ideal for anybody writing a business plan,looking for funding, or wishing to take their business tothe next level."
5,"Short, Sweet, and Pointed as an Arrow","A quick easy read for anyone wanting to start something. As someone who's founded a company, helped raise venture capital, and had a lot of experience growing companies; I can say that this book brings it together better than any I've read.Start with this book to get your basics down (and you DON'T have them down if you haven't read this book). The time you spend reading it will be paid back within days by the extra focus it brings to your efforts. Then pick up other books as necessary to go deep (I particularly recommend Guy's ""Selling the Dream"" if you're at all interested in evangalistic marketing)."
2,Probably good if you want to start a company - not great if you want to start anything else !!!,"I was disappointed - the sub-title is 'the time-tested, battle-hardened guide for anyone starting anything' - however this is not a true reflection of the contents. The book is aimed at people starting a company or organisation. I was hoping it would be more about motivational techniques for people trying to start other projects - the title suggested that to me. There were some useful items in it nonetheless, and no doubt people starting a company would possibly find it a good resource, but if you want to start anything else, then read Jack Canfield's 'The Sucess Principles' which is a better all-round resource !"
1,Kindle edition more expensive than the hardcover? WTF,"wtf? Why is the Kindle electronic edition (with no physical delivery) more expensive than ANY OTHER form of this book? More expensive than the audio, paperback and even hardcover? Are they trying to get rid of the old paper stuff? I would have bought this one but now won't as I would feel like even more than the sucker I usually am, buying things on impulse with the little BUY NOW button."
3,study this book carefully,"Every entrepreneur should know and implement strategies and techniques and concepts found in this book. For expansion and/or a complement of concepts found in my own book, ""The Expert's Edge,"" study this book carefully!"
3,"The ""Boom"" is over...time to re-write the rules...really","You just gotta love a guy who keeps re-inventing himself. That's the premise I took when I bought this book. Unfortunately it borrows on old (read: late 1990's) euphemisms mixed in with a bit of new formatting. Sure, the rules for the 'start' have some soundness, but there's just too much re-spun 90's 'if you build it they will come'. Time to wake up and smell the experience, which is what we need more of in this book. A good airplane read, but that's the problem...once you've landed, it's done."
4,No Substitute for Action,"This book is filled with some interesting, thought-provoking information. Most importantly, Guy really encourages any potential business owner to just get started. Once you get your business off the ground you can fine tune all the details later. Of course, planning is important, but it can reach a point where it becomes counter-productive. I mean, would you rather have a business or a business plan?I definitely enjoyed the book. I wouldn't say the information is necessarily earth-shattering. There's no guarantee that if you read the book you will be a successful entrepreneur, but I believe anyone interested in starting a business will be better off for reading this book."
5,A 'must read' for all people starting their own business.,"It is well written, easy to read, and the author has a experience in the field of starting up a company from both the investor and a proprietor point of view.There are a number of other books on the topic, but I found this one the best in terms of practical use and....well, helping get started!"
5,The Art of the Start. Guy kawasaki,Very motivating and has all the tools for the beginner in business.
3,"Simple, pointed advice for the new entrepreneur","Guy Kawasaki provides a direct (almost in your face) style that gets to the point very quickly. From his top ten presentations to bottom up forecasting, he clearly articulates the critical success factors and then gets out of your way. From my personal reference of two startups, his advice holds true and I recommend buying it if you have not been through a startup process in a leadership position. However, for those that have been through it, this book may only provide some simple reminders of what's important."
3,Some good thoughts,"I thought that Kawasaki's book gives a good starting point for those completely new to the concept of starting a business or any endeavor. Certainly his comments are most relevant to businesses and less so to those interested in starting a change in their current place of employment or life. Some of Guy's comments are pretty basic and obvious, but he explains them in a way that's personable, practical and less jargony than many of his peers.If you're looking for a place to start and don't mind a text that won't give you direct tools or a blueprint this is a good book to purchase. For those looking for additional help some of Guy's other books might assist and for those interested in more general change/initiatives look at ChangeThis.com for some innovative ideas."
5,A Must read for anyone starting a business,"It does not matter what I write here, this is one of those books that you simply must pickup and read to understand its true value.A fantastic read, no-nonsense approach to business and a very enjoyable read! In my opinion, this is going to be a book that I will use as a reference for years to come.Good Luck."
2,Meh.,Read this book if you like to imagine yourself starting a company. Take notes if your imaginary startup is going to be selling banalities and platitudes.You do not need this book if you are actually starting a company.
4,"Good, basic",This book covers the process of starting a business and raising money. Good basic tips and lots of the boostrapper philosophy. I love Guy's work.
4,Great check-list for anyone starting a company.,"A great checklist and lots of advice for anyone thinking of starting a company.Nothing revolutionary, perhaps nothing you wouldn't have thought of yourself, but there is great value in having a well thought-out, complete, list like this.Only 4 stars because the book seems biased towards venture-funded companies."
3,Limited Value,Having started over a dozen small businesses I was looking forward to this and purchased it after reading a review in Forbes. Sadly it was impossible for me to lock onto. In my opinion it wasn't written for the majority who start small businesses like those I've started. Motivating and interesting? Yes. Practicle. Not so much for me.
1,Book is in the trash now,I have to say that I didn't finish the book. I didn't even make it past page 15. Anybody who is going say men are dumber than women and use one book written by a female author to make his point is uncreditable. I threw the book down right then. No surprise though as most of these kind of books are written by people who make most of their money by writing books. I think I will stick to reading books authored by people who actually know what they're talking about.
4,Starting a business. For the rest of us.,"From beginning to end, Guy Kawasaki breaks down how to start a business and what stops most people from starting one. The moral of the story is to get out of your own way. Get over your fear. This book was exactly what I needed to read. Guy also goes into explaining how to fund, market and grow (or rain make) your business. In the art of the start, Guy Kawasaki does a good job of taking complex business ideas and simplifying in a way that would make you wonder why you are not already running a business."
2,Not what you think...Not really a true company start up book.,Not what you think...Not really a true company start up book. This book was written for the corporate world even though the idea and practices could be used in small businesses it is not about starting a small business. It is more about starting a business division within a large corporate company. Good book for the right reader....
2,Not the real deal.,"The book's title is apparently a homage to Donald Trump's ""The Art of the Deal"", and there are alot of similarities. Both Trump and Kawasaki have attempted with some success to create personality cults based on exaggerated accounts of their real world business success, and then to make money selling their banal wisdom to legions of wannabes. Both have profited from sleazy seminar businesses. In reality, Kawasaki has only had very limited success as a startup founder, and even less as a venture capitalist. Do a Google search under ""Dude Yamaha"" for an excellent first hand account of Kawasaki in action. Thanks, but if I want advice on starting a startup, I'll get it from someone who actually has a track record."
5,Spot on,"I've just finished reading Art of the Start and found it to be extremely informative and helpful. As the founder of a medical device startup, I've found Guy's advice to be timely and extremely insightful. You read about these companies that start in a garage, and the next day the founders are rich. This book is about ""the rest of the story""- the sweat, the risks and the insane dedication that it takes. If you or someone love are serious about starting or supporting a startup, this book is an absolute must!"
5,A must read for starting a business!,"I am in the process of starting a business and was getting a bit bogged down in the details. Guy's book was enlightening in that it presented the startup process in a very simple, yet quite profound way and has given me the tools I need to ""cut the crap"" and get it done.In addition to the primary chapters dedicated to the process itself, the final chapter ""The Art of Being a Mensch"" was outstanding.Highly recommended - thanks, Guy, for such a wonderful book."
4,Tricks Of The Trade,An informative book on entrepreneurship that cuts to the chase while providing essential details. Guy is good for the secrets of the trade.
3,The Art of the Start review,"Not a bad book after all, however a little bit dissappointing. I thought that the book gives you some hints and direction when you are about to start a new business from zero in the idealistic and genuine American dream. The first two chapters I enjoyed a lot, however the rest were too straight forward for me related to the venture capitalist system. Maybe also becuase I am not used with this system."
3,"Average book, most useful for early stage start-ups.","This book is definitely not for ""anyone starting anything"", it is specifically for a techie looking to establish a start-up. There is some good advise on how to approach venture capitalists etc. but there are many chapters full of cliches and generic advise. Overall an average book..."
2,More schlock from the king of self promotion,"I was given a complimentartu copy of this book, so thankfully none of my hard earned money was wasted. If you want to learn about starting a company there are dozens of better books than this one. Like all of Guy's books, this latest one is just another collection of banalities which will only impress the ignorant."
4,Great Ideas for Larger Ventures,"I am starting a small business and found the author's insight very helpful, but the book is geared towards those launching larger ventures. A lot of common sense and a lot of good advice on taking those first steps. My business will be smaller than those he talks about in his book so I found that much of what was outlined did not apply to my situation. Definitely recommend for those with aspirations on a grander scale."
4,Content good but disappointing Kindle format experience on ipad,"The content is good and worth reading but I downloaded the book to an ipad and to my Kindle for PC to see if it was any better. The formatting especially of tables was very haphazard. Invariably when we in Australia pay 2 times sometimes more than the price others pay for northern hemisphere books, I will continue to use my ipad and the kindle versions of books. But relatively speaking, the quality of the read via Kindle was way below the standard expected. I have found this with other books so not specifically Art of the Start. Sorry it had to be this book that gets my wrath!"
4,Very much worth a quick read,"This book made me jot down several notes and really think - which means it definitely was worth the read. I've ready dozens of business-related books, and this one still had some nice unique points included in it."
3,The Art Of The Start,"It's is not what I expected, but it was informative and helpful. I'm glad i took he time to read the book."
2,Self-indulgent drivel,"I couldn't make out whether it was the supercilious tone of the narrator, or the practice obfuscation of the writer, that made this audio disk such a pain to listen too. Either way, nothing was communicated to me that had any art or substance."
4,A worthwhile addition to your business collection.,"The Art of the Start is a very well written, thought provoking book. I read it from cover to cover. I like the idea that many references to other sources are included. This book takes a look from the financing side of a business venture. I recommend that every potential business owner read it as part of their business education.My version of The Art of the Start was bundled in withBusiness Plan Pro 15th Anniversary Editionwhich is a helpful tool to use when you start to write your business plan. If you are seriously considering starting a business and/or writing a business plan this book is one you should read before you begin."
5,mana in the wilderness,"A lot of people have attacked the Jesus Seminar and its credibility. For those who have doubts read ""The Jesus Seminar and its Critics."" Though I don't agree with everything they believe (i.e. their view on miracles) they have done some respectable things that can only help in our search for the truth, such as this book. This book should not replace the canonized gospels but shouldn't be discarded either."
3,Classic Drum solos,this is a good dvd for the drummer interested in rounding out his reportoire. It gives one an idea of where some of the patterns of todays drummers came from.
3,like watevers,"It was alright.i kinda expected it to be more longer, and deeper when it comes to his story.The documentary just touches all of his aspects very briefly, they dont mention nothing about his education, religion, or any of the fuel that fires him to be a revolutionary rebel.Your better off watching the ""Art of rap"" by ice-t(tech comes out in it by the way)"
2,Redundant and self deprecating,"What a stupid book! I could not help using childish terms to describe this book. The whole jist of the book is to flip back and forth between the hero, then the heroine, in feeling sorry for himself/herself in order to squeeze sympathy from its readers. The first one or two times it may have worked, but after the 20th and 30th repetition of how the hero feels inferior, or the heroine felt abandoned etc...I couldn't care less about either one of them. The book read as if the author wrote one passage, forgot she already wrote about that thought and then repeated the whole scenario in a different setting again and again in its subsequent chapters. The book felt like a circular voltex. There was no angst to sustain the book past the first 3 chapters. Don't read this book if you don't feel like wallowing in self pity."
4,Poker Variations,"I am new to the world of poker and this book was quite interesting. This was not how I expected though. This book is for average players or begginers and If you want specific details this is not the book for you. This book gives you the general idea of the game with minor tips and tricks that will help you, but again does not go into specific detail and situations, consider this the cliffnotes of a poker book. The book is fairly small and compact with a hard cover design which is a big plus. All in all this book is easy to read and understand."
2,Average Beginner Book,"Slightly disappointed at the coverage of the game especially with regards to odds and betting. As a beginner it was important for me to understand one game well instead of a list of dozens of games with no depth. Having said that this is a ""Little Black Book"" so it might have been too much expectation on my part for any significant coverage. The most interesting part of the book were the quotations at the beginning of each chapter.Bottom Line: if you are a beginner(like me) this is not what you are looking for."
4,venom striker,"overall from some views of my own I would say this is probebly one of the cobras best quad out onthe market..HOWEVER (dont boo me yet) there are a few things im dissapointed in.. this one doesnt hold most cobras as well as the old ones did. also this one doesnt have shocks like the old skool blue cobra quad. (come on, you loved the shocks on it!) the tires on the old skool blue one were tough rubber as well, mine are kinda stretched or cracked if yo would say. but in honor of growing up with G.I.Joe, I say this toy is deffinitly worth the money.."
5,This was my first AND favorite saddle club book!,"I picked this book out from our libraray and at first i didn't really understand it, (first saddle club book)and I cried all the way through when Pepper died. I can't believe what would happen to MY horse thinking of in no longer existing anymore. It was sad, but the most wonderful book I recomend it to any ages, I have read just about all the saddle club books and this one still remains my favorite. Happy Reading!"
4,Thanksgiving Story!,"Thanksgiving time is coming, and the Saddle Club decides to have a project that is completely selfless--it's their way of ""giving back"" what they've received. The only problem is, each one has to figure out their own project. What will they decide on?The stable owner Max is acting mysterious about something, and so is Veronica, the girl who always finds fault with the Saddle Club. Except now she's taken a turn for the worse. Or is she acting better towards them? Lisa, Stevie, and Carole can't decide which way it is.Nonetheless, the Thanksgiving projects must continue, and the Saddle Club has a lot to face over the holiday... even some things that weren't expected."
3,Mellow,"This is not your typical music in any sense. Kevin uses instruments in ways I have never seen before, and his topics range from tourism, moving to or from south america(he does not tell which), intellectual women, etc.The lyrics can be very intertaining, and the instruments, once you get used to them you may certainly come to enjoy them.However the main problem lies in the range of Kevin's voice. It is not very good, and in my opinion he would do better if he found another singer to sing along some of the songs."
5,One of the best albums I own,"I knew Kevin when he was 15. We went to the same crazy literary workshop at La Escuela Del Sol in Buenos Aires. He had the deepest, sexiest voice I had ever heard and he still does! I bought Sur o No Sur first and played it constantly and endlessly in my car. Then I bought Nada and did the same. He's absolutely unique. A great singer and songwriter, playing with great musicians, having fun. What I find funniest is that I've incorporated some of his funny lines into my regular conversation with friends."
4,Science and Mysticism compliment each other,"As a scientist and a mystic, I eye both warily when i read novels. I found the anthropology believeable and the mysticism--though slightly unique--enhanced the humanity of this novel about a barely human protagonist. Liking and relating Amber is easy, and understanding her genetic make-up follows logic. Soon I forgot about the science though, and got lost in a story as sweet and gripping as any I have read. I typically read a book slowly, but this one prevented the lawn from getting mowed and the history papewrs from being graded as I read voraciously, engrossed in the people, the places, the anthropology, and the mystery."
4,Ember Still Glows,I first read Ember From the Sun about 6 years ago. Twice more I've reread it with pleasure. I have just finished it once again and it still holds a special place in the treasure section of my heart. Fantacy? Truth? Myth? I don't care. It's a good read.
4,"Good tale, doesn't let you down.","This book was my kind of sience fiction! It was believable, but intriguing and kept my attention throughout. Sometimes these kinds of books let you down at the end, but this one was true to it's story and I loved the ending.Amazing first book"
4,Interior,I appreciated the interior challenges presented in this story of a family from a cultural basis other than my own. Blending the distant past with present and future possibilities led me along an interesting thought path.
2,One of the worse books I've ever read,'Ember From the Sun' by Mark Canter has a very interesting plot however the book falls very short in character development. The book reads as if its only purpose is to explain a scientific possibility. The story is very contrived and the characters are cardboard cutouts. I am sorry I wasted my time on this book
2,"Ramble, Ramble","Interesting because it's a true story, and for Canadians some recognizable names, but oh does it ramble. This story could have and should have been told in 100 pages not 373."
4,Grim Satisfaction,"The Blue Trust chronicles the rise and fall of two highly ambitious people, Bruce and Lynne Verchere. For those of us who worked at Manac Systems in the mid-eighties there is some grim sense of satisfaction with respect to the destiny of Lynne Verchere. The author avoids the darker side of Vercheres personality, but for those of us who knew her, any sense of pity that the story elicits is mitigated by the reality of having dealt with her on a day to day basis. Lynne Verchere was not a victim. The final tragedy of Bruce Verchere is a metaphor for the gaping hole in her own psyche. Notwithstanding the mess he had made of his life, Bruce Vercheres last desperate act was undoubtedly triggered by her final ""victory"" over him."
4,Hereclues,"I have herd this music there and abouts, but am not as mych a fon of Herecules as I am of Xena. I think the Xena cd is better theough . To get there all you half to do is just click back three times, then go to popler music and type in Xena Warrior princess and go to oringel televishion sound trak and you'll be there ~"
2,FLIMSY,"Just received this flash. I can not yet rate the operation of the unit. However, it is very flimsy. The bracket is delicate and the housing of the actual flash seems to be of cheap plastic. I expected better of Metz for a product of this cost."
5,Best addition to a point & shoot or a entry-level dSLR,"I bought this flash to use with my Canon SD1000 and Panasonic FZ28, since they don't have a hotshoe and their flashes have limited ranges. It worked right out of the box, and after a few shots in learning mode, my pictures were really great!After a while, I got a Canon Rebel XSi, and although its flash is a lot more powerful, the use of lens hoods and 'fat' wide-angle lenses would usually cast shadows on the lower part of the picture. Using the Metz CS-2 solved this problem.It is very small, a little larger than a deck of cards, and fits easily in any backpack or in your pocket. Although it has a plastic casing (making it really light), it's solid and withstood some drops without any damages.I'm very happy with this product."
3,Misleading Picture,"I had expected it to be like what it looks like in the the picture, (made of pipes) but it came in a plastic gun thing that you have to pump to shoot, but usually doesnt work well."
5,"The soundtrack score itself is fine, but..","Those looking for the songs used in ""While You Were Sleeping"" can track them down here:This Will Be (An Everlasting Love) (2003 Digital Remaster)Merry, Merry Christmas(the ""Christmas in Chicago"" song)Winter WonderlandLet It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It SnowHave Yourself A Merry Little ChristmasI'm Your SantaWherever Would I Be?"
1,While You Were Sleeping Soundtrack,"I actually have a question-hope someone out there can help! After reading the other reviews, I wasn't sure that this CD has what I want. The song at the very end of the movie ""Wherever would I be without you..."" is how it starts. Anyone know the title and artist? THANKS!"
3,A Soundtrack That Captures The Feel Of The Movie,"My all-time favorite movie is ""While You Were Sleeping"", and I couldn't wait to hear the soundtrack! Randy Edelman did a great job of capturing the feel of this movie with the whimsical music used in the film. If you close your eyes while listening, you can picture every scene from Lucy saving Peter, to Joe Junior and Jack's discussion about ""leaning""! The music is all straight from the film, and completely instrumental. The only drawback is that it tends to be repetitive. If you want to hear some soft, light-hearted music while cleaning house or going to bed, this CD hits the spot, but if you are not a die-hard fan of this movie, you won't fully appreciate this soundtrack."
3,Soundtrack-While You Were Sleeping,"The movie is one of my all-time favorites. I also love the music, but I was disappointed that it was only the background music and contained none of the other songs from the movie."
1,Dissappointing,"I disagree with Mr. Michigan. I buy a soundtrack for the actual songs that are in the movie, not the music they play in the background of a scene. I too wanted to find ""Christmas in Chicago"", etc. So, he should not presume to know what every person looks for in a soundtrack based on his own opinion. I will be skipping this soundtrack."
4,Brief Info on Book,"Large paperback, 143 pps, over 140 illustrationsA lovely book giving a terrific overview of stained glass, with an emphasis on modern and contemporary works."
4,Best Guide to Gaining Mass,"I have been lifting for years now, but I have never seen the results I have gained with this book before. This book is perfect for getting yourself out of that plateau or training rut. The only problem I have with the book is the diet suggestions are extremely repetitive. I have found myself looking elsewhere for meal suggestions."
2,Very Disappointed,"The author as a writer does not know that the New covenant ia a covenant of Grace. They cannot mix together the new covenant of Grace with the old Covenant which is the law. The Bible clearly says in the old testament that the The lord says that the day will come that He will make a New Covenant with his people and It will not be like the One that He has made with their fathers.The Bible also says the the Lord make the former covenant obsolute so He can establish the other.""The Lord's Table "" by Andrew Murray was much better."
5,Grace Revealed...,"This book is an answer to prayer for any person who has asked God to grant him/her a deeper understanding and appreciation of the mystery of the Catholic Mass. Any cradle Catholic who has fallen away from the Church because 'I'm not being fed at my local parish,' read this book and open your eyes to the utter glory of the privilege that you have abdicated--to receive the actual presence of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Eucharist, our Marriage Supper with the Lamb. Dr. Hahn's passion, intelligence, and faithfulness shine through in his insightful and lucid delineation of the relevance of the Book of Revelation to the Mass. It's not new information, but his style and approach are perhaps a bit more compelling to the average lay-person than that of the Catholic Catechism."
4,"Live Scripture, attend Mass","As a ""revert"" to the Church this book was very helpful. It helps a person to see Mass in the light of Scripture and Scripture in the light of Mass. I heard many false accusations about the Mass while I was away from the Church Christ established on St. Peter. This book, written by a former anti-Catholic Presbyterian who converted to the Catholic Church, really opens your eyes to not only the Scriptural basis for the Mass, but to the historical continuity of the Christian faith as expressed in the liturgical worship of the Mass."
5,Lamb's Supper,This a wonderful book for anyone interested in The Book Of Revelations in the Holy Bible. The study guide is of great help also.
5,Great book,Very informative and thought provoking. I had never given much thought to the book of Revelation and Hahn manages to bring it to life.
5,Glorious Interpretation,"Dr. Scott Hahn is a blessing both for Roman Catholics and Protestants alike. His skill for demonstrating a Catholic belief structure in a way that will not scare off the Evangelical brethern is a talent that few have. In this volume, he demonstrates this talent perfectly by explaining the most misunderstood practice of the Catholic faith, the Mass, while explaining the most misunderstood book of the Bible, the Apocalypse, in the light of the mass. It is an eye-opener to say the least. This book should be required reading for both Catholics and Protestants alike -- for Catholics, it reinforces the ritual we go through every week; for Protestants, it will shed light on all those ""bizarre"" and ""confusing"" practices that Catholics perform. Either way, the reader will only come out strengthed and better for reading this book."
5,A model of good scholarship and accessible popular writing,"When all is said and done, can there be a more fundamental and central framework within which to situate the whole order of liturgical theology and practice than that of the sacramental invocation of the Kingdom of God? This growing conviction was brought home to me recently by this book, ""The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth,"" by Scott Hahn of the Franciscan University of Steubenville. Hahn's book is a model combination of good scholarship and accessible popular writing."
5,"Another MASTERPIECE by Senior Apologist, Dr. HAHN! :)","A MUST for any Catholic Apologist; from Beginner to Master!Dr. Hahn, one of Catholicism's most revered Apologists, once again, turns out a masterpiece!A tremendously rich and informative source of Catholic Truth!Not only for the Apologist; this book is a fantastic resource for Priests, Religious, Catechists and Catholic Laymen, alike.In this easy to comprehend book, Dr. Hahn explores the Book of Revelations and shows how it matches the Catholic Mass in every way.Literally, it is a wonderful guide to understanding the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass!I HIGHLY recommend this book.DMShae"
5,Catholic Mass,Scott Hahn looks through the eye's of a Protestant minister about the Catholic Mass and how it tracks to Revelations. This study helped Scott convert to a Catholic.
3,"Silly, but some interesting stuff","This book would probably be 100% better if it was 50% smaller. There's a lot of build-up, but when you get to the main chapter, that's supposed to reveal how the Mass is spelled out in the Book of Revelation, what greets you is a simple table of elements in the Mass and where they might be found in the Apocalypse.Add to that the silly chapter section headings like ""Moriah Carry"" and it's a little frustrating.There is some useful info here, but I wish it was presented better."
3,I guess I'm in the minority,"I found The Lamb's Supper merely interesting, and that would not compel me to recommend it to anyone looking for a book to strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ. If a person wants to know exactly where the parts of the Mass are backed up by Scripture, excellent book. Being Catholic, maybe I expected something more than what had been presented in religion class over the years. The book may be more meaningful to those of other denominations. The book had me saying ""Oh I didn't know that"" to many of the gee whiz correlations with Revelations. It reads like a cathechism and lacks the personal draw that good books of faith have, the draw that brings reflection and the desire to know Jesus Christ more closely."
5,The Mass is Heaven on Earth,"This book gives you a whole new outlook on the mass. It ignites a fire in and shows you how great it is to be Catholic. Scott Hahn is one of the great theologians of our time. I would recomend it to anyone, Catholic or not."
5,THE book on the Mass,"I am reading a third book by Scott Hahn. The Lamb's Supper is the one that gave the impetus. I have never felt so in tune with my faith as I have since reading this book. In the manner of a true theologian, but not over the head of his reader, Mr. Hahn brings into focus the truest sacrifice. This is a must for anyone who is Catholic or even slightly interested in the Catholic faith."
3,Mass has biblical ties,I loved this book for the fact that it demonstrates the origins of the Catholic mass. It is all biblical. The ties between the mass and the book of Revelation were eye opening. This book will only enrich one's understanding and appreciation for the mass.
5,Wonderful work by this professor,"Dr. Scott Hahn discovers, or shall I say, RE-discovers a thesis that the Mass is in fact what is spoken of in the Book of Revelations. He shows that all of the things John sees in his famous vision take place during the Mass. A great book to show non-Catholics the fulfillment of the prophecy in the last book."
5,Wonderful,"Scott Hahn gives a wonderful view of how the Book of Revelations relates to the Mass. In fact, it become quite apparent that you miss the entire point of book of Revelations if you don't know how the early Christians celebrated the Mass."
4,"Great book, bad puns","As always, Hahn is thought-provoking and instructive. There is so much rubbish out there by way of pop eschatology; Scott Hahn gives an interpretation of the book of Revelation that is consistent and loyal to the Magisterium of the Church, showing the deep liturgical meaning that is inherent in the symbolism of this much-misunderstood book of the Bible. Hahn's style is colorful and breezy, making this a very readable book. Its one flaw, and it is a glaring one, is the pointless and distracting bad puns. Fortunately, they are largely confined to the titles of the various subsections of the book, and so are not in the text itself. Hahn's purpose is no doubt to make very serious theology readable and non-threatening to the average reader, but really, Dr. Hahn: your point would be made more clearly if you would skip the puns!"
5,The Lamb's Supper,"Scott Hahn shares his expert knowledge on a subject so often misunderstood and neglected.The ""Lamb's Supper"" ties together the book of Revelation and the Roman Catholic Mass.Thus, it offers clarity on both subjects, along with a new and joyful enthusiasm. Sound teaching, and verythought provoking."
5,The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth,"Great commentary on the Mass, great commentary on Revelations, great book! It's been said by others and I agree: it's a must-read for Christians!"
5,Beautifully sung collection of Cole Porter,"The lovely and talented Broadway actress Rebecca Luker sings a great collection of Cole Porter in that clear and stunning voice! She's the Barbara Cook of the New Millenium. An actress who sings - a singer who acts. My favorite: the devasting beauty and simplicity of ""Everytime We Say Goodbye"". Anyone with a dry eye after this one needs to check their pulse."
4,Angelic Voice!,"If you like Cole Porter or a beautiful voice, this recording is for you. If Ms. Luker had refrained from singing her 'R's (It bugs the heck out of me), I would have given the recording 5 stars."
5,broadway singing at its very best,this an obvious labor of love her voice is marvelous and backgound orchestrations are extremly good. while she does remind you julie andrews she is even better and like julie she also seems to have a great sense of humor. That cover shows that she is no prude.
3,Poor Accompaniment,"I agree with the reviewer who complained that the orchestrations are too loud and too brassy. A recording studio is not the Broadway stage, and frankly I doubt that Porter's tunes were arranged this obtrusively even for the stage.In addition, though Luker has a very good voice, her rendering of these numbers is uneven. The phrasing seems odd in places, almost too stylized, and flat in others. Overall a disappointing CD, even though Ms. Luker's basic talent is obvious."
2,She's No Barbara Cook,"I just don't get it. A trained soprano voice well suited for Showboat, but for her to take on Cole Porter is ludicrous. I get no sense of his lyrics at all. In fact I hate hearing it done this way. Barbara Cook had the beautiful voice and the sense of what she was singing. Ms. Luker is only half a loaf."
2,Second effort,"Glee was one of the best CD's I have ever purchased. I thought to myself that there was no way Discosis could ever live up to it's predecessor, but if it was even half as good I'd love it. Even with these low expectations, I found myself very disappointed.Bottom line: The CD is not really stellar but I may just feel this way because the first CD was so good."
2,What Happened?,"After reading all these 5-star reviews, I went back and listened to Discosis all the way through again, but I still think it's two step backwards from Glee. This new release sounds like a bunch of airy pop tunes with no guts. Where is this cd's ""Couch Surfer?"" There's plenty of ""Drinking in LA"" wanna-be's on Discosis, but not much else. Color me disappointed. Bummer."
1,buy glee and save your money on this one,"The stupid club beats get annoying, but i suppose that's what they were trying to get across.....their first album was great, but the only song i care for on this is 'rock star' all in all it doesnt seem as diverse as the first one"
4,a juicy curl set goes well with discosis,"With an album as scattered as glee coming from apparently more of an unformed collective than a solid group I was expecting a big sophomore slump in discosis. I was too curious to resist the purchase and the album has been playing constantly since. The Curtis Mayfield track is a fantastic song and I wish had been more of a hit, the sexy crooning that is not afraid to be fancy is such a nice change of pace from all the soundalike gutteral voice rock bands howling around. Also it sets a nice tone that the rest of the album holds up except for one or two tracks (I am thinking ""The answer"" and ""loaded"" specifically) Overall this album is not a simple rehash of glee material, there are certainly more real songs here, and some stunning moments in ""More Shopping"" & ""montreal"" which ends in a chant that loops back again later in the album. Very impressive -"
5,For the price you could do lot worst.,Bought it for my daughter. She likes the performance on freeways and high ways. In the city it might be more prone to false alarms.
4,Inexpensive and Effective,"This is the 1st detector I have owned. It worked well for 1.5 months, then it suddenly blew a fuse and stopped picking up radar signals. I returned it to the manufacturer and they replaced it with a new one within 3 weeks, exactly the time I was promised. This specific model will signal false alarms when driving by banks, stores, etc. when in Highway mode, but I prefer to drive in this mode. This product is very effective - it has successfully alerted me well in advance of every speed trap I have gone through. Good value and performance (malfunction notwithstanding) for the money. I would have given it 5 stars if I did not have to return it due to the malfunction. However, I am pleased with the manufacturer's service under warranty."
5,excellent device,This is my second Whistler but newer model and works even better.The second day I bought it it save me a ticket warning me about copsbehind the corner. It's seem to be very sensitive and it's a steal for the money. Look very good too.
4,Whistler XTR-140,A great little detector at a great price. Some false alarms but overall an excellent value.
2,got pulled over 2 days into using the radar detector.,got stopped going 90 in a 70 mph zone two days after receiving the radar detector! Received a ticket for it.
2,You get what you pay for,"It was cheap, and as a result, is a far less effective detector with poorer filtration of false signals than a higher dollar detector. My Escort quit working after 10 years, so I got one of these to tide me over until I decided what detector I wanted. I realized it would not outperform my Escort by a longshot, but its detection range is pitiful whether in highway, city, city 1 or city 2 mode.It does have some neat features like the voice warning and different sound warnings and the ability to go completely dark, but if you are a chronic speeder like me, don't expect it to save you from much. It will not be mistaken for a Valentine One, high end Beltronics or Escort/Passport. I'd recommend spending more money on a higher quality detector."
1,This is the worst Whistler radar detector,"I have owned a number of Whistler radar detector units over the years. They have generally performed well and to my satisfaction.I bought this new Whistler XTR-140 about three months ago. I decided to put this through some tests across the western US before I start to rely on it.This unit has very poor detection capability - in most cases it will only go off when the radar is within a few hundred feet, with the radar gun looking straight at this detector unit. Had I been speeding, I would have collected a number of speeding tickets. Within the city limits, the unit almost constantly beeps with false alarms. It provides no reliable laser performance, as with a police laser unit almost within a 10 degrees of the line of sight of my car, this detector showed no activity.Its periscope is annoying and along with the poor detection performance gives you Xmas lighting only.I'd avoid this unit - it is a complete waste of money."
2,"Worked great... for a little while, then died","I was very happy with this product at first, as it would alert me to a cop sometimes as much as 10 seconds before I would even see the cop. The twin periscope warning lights were also a nice touch. Unfortunately, it stopped working after about three months. I might've just gotten a bad unit, as I see there a lot of great reviews on here, but definitely disappointed with the quality."
4,whistler,"its great for the price. works well, not GREAT but still. its very directional, and doesnt have amazing range but all in all it works, its picked up more than a few cops for me. not a whole lot of false reads either."
4,Got it just in time,"I just got this in time, since they are no longer available. I hope they come back so you can get one.I will review it in case that happens.I had one for many years and I got it wet or I imagine I would have had it for another 10 years. this is a solid unit and this new model keeps out all the unnecessary beeps I got with the older model.I thought it was broken since I did not beep, then suddenly I came across road work and it started to beep. Very nice very cost effective. I put mine under the dash so it is out of sight, the police do not like to see them, and it works great right through the front of my car."
1,Terrible,"I got this during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale and tested it for almost a month. While this detector is great for detecting doors and other X band interference, it simply doesn't detect real cops. Spend your money on something a little better."
2,Gives false alarms and not very reliable,"Bought it around thanksgiving as it was one of the sale items. Just to test it, drove around for over a month, both within the city & on interstate. It constantly gave false readings when, during daytime, there was clearly no visible sign of any police car in front or behind me, driving on highway. I tried all the various frequency settings as well, to eliminate these but in the end I just gave up. At night, the sharp blue led will draw attention to you when it lights up."
4,An appreciated gift,I got this as a gift for my Daughter - She LOVES it! You could not pry it away from her...
4,radar detector,"It hooks up easy and is simple to understand so the convenience is nice.I find that it helps me sometimes in avoiding a dicey situation but it doesnt provide any guarantees because some cops go on visual and maybe a different technology.well, all you got to do is have it save you twice to pay for itself so that is pretty much a no brainer for me. I think it is worth the money."
1,Guaranteed Speeding Ticket,"I had this for the past month and I do a lot of highway and city driving.I noticed that on just two occasions, it warned me that a local cop was parked ahead. I wasnt speeding anyway but it was nice to know that it alerted me. I was driving on the highway and twice I saw a cop parked on the ramp pointing a radar gun at my lane and the detector did not go off both times. Luckily I wasnt speeding but if I was, I would have got nailed twice! two tickets.So dont let this give you a false sense of security. It is not reliable.Of course it goes off every five seconds when I am driving by a building with automatic doors but thats not the reason I got it.Its not worth returning because its not worth the effort to package back up and ship out.I dont know who is giving this 5 stars but this unit is not worth 5 stars"
4,So far so Good,"I've had this radar for about 5 months now. I don't have any major complaints. I think that somtimes it beeps for false things that aren't cops but for the most part it works and i haven't gotten a ticket yet. however, i don't think i've been at the point where it's saved me from a ticket either. It's good for the price i paid, and i purchased it on a whim. reviews were good, so i just went for it. Didn't really need it but it was a good price. I would recommend this product if you're looking for a radar on a budget, but if you've got money to spend and drive with a lead foot, perhaps i'd look into something with a farther range of detection and slight better filter for false detections."
4,Paid for itself in one week,"for the price I paid, this product works amazing!!! It paid for itself in just one week and saved me from getting a speeding ticket, I was driving on the highway and suddenly the RD went off flashing quickly. I started to brake right away and there was the cop on the side of the road!! I recommend this product! If you want a cheap RD, this is it! It's not perfect though, sometimes you get false alarms but I leave it in City 2 to reduce false alarms. Alarms doesn't mean there is a cop, you just have to learn how to read the alerts and what it's trying to tell you.2 Annoying things I don't like: Annoying blue lights that can't be turned off, and you have to set the settings everytime you turn it on.But besides that, it works perfect!!! If your RD starts going off, you better start braking. You got roughly about 15 seconds if you are going 15mph on the highway."
1,Lasted only 2 months.,"Ordered this item at the end of September, beginning of December it would not turn on. Lasted just over 2 months :( Nuff said."
4,Great Value,"This radar detector is bare bones with no bells and whistles, but all I wanted was a great radar detection system and this one does the job."
4,Bang for the buck!,"Bought this as a gift for a dear friend. He tells me this unit has already gotten him out of a few possible scrapes. There are much better units out there like the Valentine One, but for the money this is a very capable product."
1,No comparison to Beltronics RX65,"I purchased this because of the ratings it received which were equivalent to my Beltronics RX65 radar detector. I placed it on the auto dash next to my reliable detector that I've had for 4 years or so just to see how accurate it was. It rarely ever detected signals and when it did ""whistle"", my Beltronics didn't. I was even next to a police car and it didn't even recognize the Ka band that the other gave loud and clear. I was going to give this as a Christmas gift, I'm glad I tested it out beforehand. On a more positive note, I sent it back and was promptly refunded."
2,Does not detect laser,"I've had this detector for over a year. It does a good job at detecting radar, but last week I got targeted with a laser gun (the cop told me this after he stopped me) and received no warning at all from the detector. Come to think of it, now that I've had it for over a year, I never got a single laser warning from it."
3,No more tickets for my hubby!,"We have never had a radar detector before. The only complaint that I have is the instructions aren't very detailed. There is an online manual, but as far as plug and use I wasn't entirely confident that I knew how to set it up. We took a road trip to Orlando to the Capital One Bowl and didn't get any tickets so I am happy. It did warn us several times so I feel strongly that it is reliable.Update... my husband got a ticket and the radar detector never went off. :("
5,Whistler XTR 140 Radar Detector,"Our kids got this for my husband for father's day. He loves it. We laughed the other day, we had set the radar detector on the floor when we made a stop and forgot to put it back on the windshield. It detected radar from the floor, we were amazed!We would recommend this to anyone, great price"
2,Review/Tests Websites in Post,"I'd say for the money its a good detector (not much competition in the $40 range). Just watch out for hills, curves, and instant on. Most cheap detectors lack on Ka band (most popular police radar band) also.The best detector for the money in my opinion is the BEL v940Beltronics V940 Vector Radar/laser Detector with Text Display and Voice Alerts (Black/Silver). My brother and fiance both have this and love it.In short: If you want a real RD get a Beltronics, Escort, or Valentine One. Stay away from Cobra, Whistler, or Rocky Mountain Radar!guysoflidar.com"
4,Good Product for the Price,"I bought this product to become more aware of my surroundings and i believe it does the job. Its not going to be outstanding because its not high quality, but it will be consistent with alerts. I live in a very urban environment, so the detector will pick up signals from automatic sliding store doors, but other than that, it works pretty well. i have used the nice $500 detectors and the only difference is the precise sensitivity and the other features besides detecting radars and lasers. Also, the range on the expensive models is far superior. If you are in the market for a reasonable detector that is basic and consistent, then this fits your criteria."
4,Great So Far,I Bought this and put it in my car. It was placed in center windshield but i found out that is illegal in CA. so it is now in my lower left side of windshield. This is a good place to hide it and to see it easier. On H mode (highway) i always have it on. Along with V/L (V2 and Laser) is always on. It has not picked up many false alarms which is great. and i know my area well and there had been no high alerts i need to pay attention to because i know there are no cops. So i am waiting to see if it will work when there are some. But you cant beat the price! Buy!
4,Good Radar Detector.,gives you enough time to slow down. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because some times there are fake warnings but othere than that its a good detector for $40 its not bad.
4,Good value for the money,Seems to work perfectly fine. Extra blue lights on the side are very helpful. Already saved me from a lot of trouble. Very good value for this kind of price.
1,Horrible! Waste of money!,"I wasted money on this and got a ticket the first time I used it! I trusted it again thinking that it was maybe a fluke the first time. I got another ticket and this time the silly thing didn't even go off! Of course, if you're worried about getting pulled over and a ticket from the electronic double doors of a grocery store, this is the radar detector for you. That's really the only time it makes a noise is when it detects electronic double doors. I would say 4 out of 5 times I've passed a patrol car that I saw was definitely running radar, this thing stayed quiet. It's a piece of junk. You get what you pay for. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Get what you pay for...,"I was extremely happy to pay the price I did for this model, but while the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"", some things need to be tweaked a little. The product works very well on the Highway setting, while also looking very nice and like it should have cost much more, the City setting has issues. I live in a small rural town, so most of our major businesses (banks, pharmacies, car dealerships, etc) are located down main street strip, which causes it to be hell driving along and having the detector alarming almost constantly. If it weren't for that, I would have given the product 5 stars."
2,Thanks for letting me know,"I was skeptical when I purchased this product...my skepticism was well placed...WIthin the first hour of my road trip, I saw flashing lights in my rearview mirror. It was a second after I noticed the lights in my rearview that the detector decided to ""inform me"" that there was a police officer attempting to pull me over.The detector did a mediocre job of going off with enough time to slow down enough...Needless to say, I got 1 ticket on my roadtrip and drove 5+ the rest of the time...Disappointment."
3,ok but great costumer service,"It is not the best radar detector by a long shot, but its cheap. Mine was lost in the mail, but they sent me a new one and upgraded the shipping."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this product to replace a Uniden detector that I had for 16yrs. To begin with, far too short a distance before the alarm goes off. By the time you get an alert, chances are you're being clocked. As for the super bright readout, it's bright allright. Too bright. At night it lights up the inside of my vehicles cab. Extremely noticeable from behind when the alert goes off. I almost wish that I had paid the extra $10.00 for a model with a dimmer switch. I felt that was too much extra to pay for that simple feature. The exclusive twi-alert periscopes. Not necessary, one would suffice. The unit comes with a suction cup mounting bracket that will only stick to your windshield, unless you have a dashboard that's as smooth as glass. Will not stick to textured surface. You'll need to use velcro. Price is low, but like so many other products, you get what you pay for. Overall, not happy with this product. Would not recommend this to a friend."
1,Not Worth a Dime!!,"The Whistler XTR-140 is worthless! In the first week, I drove through three CHP speed traps and the Whistler XTR-140 didn't make a peep! Nothing!! On two of the those occasions, I could see the officer sighting me in and..... Nothing!! (I wasn't speeding and they didn't stop me) I've driven through about a dozen ""Your Speed Is..."" indicators and.... Nothing!! My buddy is a baseball coach and has a radar gun for his pitchers. We tried it out and..... Nothing!!! I tried out my Crimson Trace laser on it and... Nothing!! This is a worthless piece of junk and DON'T BUY IT!! Fortunately, Amazon gave me my money back so, if you do buy this piece of junk, save all the packaging so you can get your hard earned bucks back on this WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK!!"
1,no work,winclude promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensationork no work and whether they met your
2,items missing from package,"It came out of the package with the suction cups and little bracket missing. Whistler wont send them, have to be purchased. So never have gotten to use this to see if it works."
1,sucks,"Like everyone else on this page I had high hopes for the whistler.Ive never had a radar detector before because I always thought they were stupid.But, I had no proof until I actually bought one. Piece of junk. Its an automatic door detector - and thats pretty much it. Don's waste your money on a cheap detector."
5,Great product,Works extremely well. It's not yet once failed to pick up a signal when a cop is clocking. Husband loves it!
2,Worked OK for just a few weeks.,"Used it occasionally for the first few weeks. Worked OK with the usual issues of a lower-end radar detector, then stopped working just a few days after the return period was over."
3,You get what you pay for?,"I've had this for a few weeks now and I'm not impressed with it. Even on the city setting, it seems to alert me more when passing certain buildings than it does anything else. I was hoping that a cheaper unit would be as effective as a more expensive one. Maybe this isn't the case.Shipping was fast. Packaging was great. Would purchase from seller again.Just not overly thrilled with the actual product."
2,Does it really work?????????????????????,"I have been using it for the last week or two and half the time I don't know if it is actually working or not. I've noticed whenever I get close to building, it seems to go off as if a police car is only a foot away but there is no police for miles. There were other times police cars went past me or I went past them and it didn't blink or make any noises. These cops had their flashers and siren on. I suppose they also had their radar on as well but nothing from XTR-140. There were times when I didn't notice cops sitting near me it did go off. So, I have no idea if it really detecting anything for real or not.The only thing that seems to work is the menu settings, buttons and the display."
3,Inoperative after only 3 months...,"After having it for only 3 months it stopped working. It would power-on-self-test but didn't alarm at ANY signals. Sent it back to Whistler and they ""re-soldered components under horn"". Works fine again but I don't expect it to last very long."
4,Good for the price.,This is good for the price. Though sometimes it is difficult to figure out in which mode it is. But I guess I will need to use it for sometime before I can understand it more accurately.
3,Just fun,"Got this product for my dad, its fine tells you when you are being monitored , but if a laser land on your car, you are caught :) (as told about the product) because its just a detector. over all good sound alert."
3,No frills radar detector,"Goods: Price. The radar detector seems to work as well as older, higher priced models I have used in the past.Bads: Can not adjust brightness, although it isn't too bright at night. You get a bright glare from the silver buttons on top of the radar detector depending on the angle of your windshield."
1,You get what you pay for - it stinks,"This radar detector stinks. I put this in a second car after having a more high priced detector by another mftr in my car for the last 2 or 3 years. So I got used to good performance and always had plenty of warning - long before I could see the cop I heard him. But now with the Whistler XTR-140 I am hugely disapointed. The only thing that seems to set it off are the signals generated by stop lights and roadside DOT signs. It does light up like a Christmas tree when approaching a stop light but not when cops are shooting you, even ""townies"" with old style radar are not picked up. I'm going to hang this puppy on my Christmas tree and enjoy the lights."
4,Good for the average driver,"Ok heres the real deal. It is not an excellent 100% awesome detector, no detector is. People need to understand that about half the time, police drive around without there radars on. But when they do have it on, this whistler detector picks em up just fine with plenty of warning if you're going about 15 mph or less over the limit. Usually on highways and semi busy roads police have their radars on, but at intersections, red lights, and neighborhoods, their usually off. And their also off when a cop has someone pulled over."
2,so-so,"For a basic detector it works fine. I put it next to my OLD Uniden (15+years old) and the Whistler picked up things well before the Uniden did. The twin blue periscopes are ANNOYING!!!! They are very bright and on this model are NOT able to be shut off (the next model up you can). The Volume is too loud, even on the lowest setting.Overall, if you are looking for a good basic radar detector, this is a good one...I've taken a piece of black electrical tape and covered the periscopes, but I shouldn't have to do this!"
1,Not as expected,Does not work on fixed Road Speed Radars or on Overpasses fixed radars.it detects only signal frequencies and other random signal.it was a bad experience.
1,Worked for one road trip... :(,"I was excited to get this positively rated radar detector for our upcoming roadtrip down to LA. It worked okay but had many false alarms. For the 6 hour drive, the radar detector went off about 30 times on highway mode. Of those, 3 were actual cops already pulling over people or on the other side of the freeway. Unfortunately when I tried for another long road trip a month later, I found out it had died. :( I didn't think things could just die spontaneously like that but to me it was not worth dealing with the company or buying another Whistler product again."
1,I would not buy this for anyone.,Like all radar detectors you have to read the fine print. Go to Whistler's website at whistlergroup(dot)com and check the specs on this radar detector.All the xtr-140 does is detect VG-2(a very outdated band that very few police officers use) and Safety Warning System - SWS(Aka emergency vehicles - a band that theoretically does not exist). So in other words you are paying for a rock. I do not even have to buy it to know how lousy this Radar Detector is because I am educated.Before you go out and buy a Radar Detector educate yourself. Don't buy it because it looks good or it flashes lights at you. The main reason you buy a Radar Detector is to have it detect radar guns. Educate yourself. Search for Radar Roy on the web and take advantage of his years of experience and testing with Radar Detectors. Then see if you are still interested in this Radar Detector. Trust me you won't be. Be smart America.
1,lousy,"Doesnt even work. Drive by cops all the time and it never goes off. While some may not have radar on at the time i pass, at least a few must and I mean it NEVER goes off. Unless I go near the schools in town (must pick up their security systems or something). I don't even bother plugging this in anymore."
1,"Didn't work, at all","Probably not the most fair review, but the detector that I received did not work AT ALL. I tried everything and it was just completely dead right out of the box. I probably should exchange it for another, but I am a little worried about the quality. I was really looking forward to using this on a trip that we are taking tomorrow..."
2,not for PA,"does not warn for enrad, which pa uses, good for highway though, state troopers use radar :P depends on the roads you travel"
2,Waste of money!,"Don't buy this item! I thought it looked good for the price, boy was I wrong! I drove right past I don't know how many cops in the past 2 days and the thing never went off. It will go off randomly, but not when there are any cops around. Save your money and purchase one that actually works!"
1,Utter crap :/,"Bought this product when it was on sale, Wanted to get a radar scanner for quite some time and this one was pretty cheap. But, NOT worth the 40$, It goes off at random times, dose not go off when a cop is near, nor far away, drove passed a total of 7 cops in one morning. It sat there quite as a mouse, until I drove pass a bridge with no cars/cops on it and it lights up like the 4th of July. waste of money"
4,I was ticked,An road official fined me outgoing from a curve and the radar detector didn't warn me. I had to pay a 100 ticket
4,Great radar for the price,"Havent had any problems. Seems to catch a few store alarms along the way, but seems to be a great product for the price."
4,Great Quality For A Great Price,"This detector is pretty darn good, saved me the first day actually! The price is perfect! So much better than the cheaper cobras....."
3,great for the price budget mind,the unit works decent if you are looking for hi quality look elseware unit does give false alarms in city as expected i bought for my teenage son unit in vg2 mode makes unit very sensitive to all false alarms so he uses on highway mode at all times no memory of previouse settings which is a negative he says in area near his job it does warn him of radar units at night well ahead of visual contact overall for starter unit is fine ther is no city 3 mode unable to find setting in manual and unable to set auto quite mode. does the job
5,Excellent Detector On Open Roads,"I bought the Whistler xtr-140 in June 2009, It was a wise decision. I really try not to speed but the radar-detector helps me watch my speed, it's been a blessing in saving me from getting tickets. I would recommend this to all drivers, it helps you watch your speed and save you money. Speed Cops know we have them, they angle their cars to keep the detector-signal off, you'll see this in mostly wooded areas of the highway's works great on interstates 90% of the time. The detector won't catch all radar laser beams so use your eye sight as well. I'm going to buy a more expensive detector with added features like false alarm memory and full circle radar protection, Whistler does not have either, but works great!"
4,It was a gift request,"It was a gift for a in law that lives overseas... After looking what was available the Whistler had most of what I was looking for... It covered all the available bands and laser. I doubt that the in law's country is using laser. Price, features and the ratings drove the choice."
2,Not useful at all.,"Invest in a higher-end product. This one remains silent even when the entire figurative Canadian mounted police has you surrounded. And then, when you don't care or want to be informed, it will give you a slew of alerts indicating that someone has entered or exited the grocery store. Two stars for powering on, having lights that flash, and making a noise, even if it isn't useful at all."
4,It's Okay,"The product arrived on time and I like this product a lot. I will admit that it's not a full proof detection system; it only works when a radar gun is fixed on you or you're in the direct presence of an inferred beam. I have passed cops with the gun pointed at other oncoming cars and the detector didn't read anything, but I have also see cops lock on to me and then the thing went crazy. It never works around corners or blind spots so if you come around a bend and get looked on you speed will definitely be known. Radar detectors are more of a way of alerting you to when you're speed had already been detected they are not very well at telling beforehand where cops are in wait. Over all I still use it and would recommend this product."
2,Slightly better than nothing...,"Buy up...oddly enough, this is the second one of these units that I have owned...I bought one, re'cd the other as a gift...it is really a pretty sorry product. Both of mine (in different vehicles) seem to shut off randomly...they certainly DO detect radar...if they happen to be on....at first I thought it might be a power issue in the cord or the input, but since both do it I think that the unit itself is simply flaky...."
2,piece of junk,I guess its what you get for what you pay. unless the cop is next to you it wont beep...
1,Best Light and Noise Show ever,I loved taking this out and watch cop cars pass me with their radars clearly out and this thing didn't give one hoot. Then I drive thru a farm area and it goes off like nothing! I almost had a ciesure!
3,question,Is it need to connect a GPS with this radar to work or not because i bought one last mont and it needs to make a connection with my car's GPS?
3,Wrong One Sent,I ordered the xtr-140 and they shipped a xtr-150. Its about the same but I ordered the xtr-140 because of the reviews and the xtr-150 does not have that many so I really am not sure what I have. A better one or an updated one or what. You would think by the number it would be a newer version but that is not always true. The shipper should have at least put a note on the receipt about the difference.
3,ok Product,The two LEDS are very bright and it may attract others. It beeps contentiously for some signals from other cars.
5,Great Buy,"We have had ours for 2 years and have lost count of the times it has saved us from getting a ticket! It does give a false signal when passing certain towers, but you can easily tell the difference between those and the real thing. I am purchasing one today for our son so he can come out for the Holidays ticket-free! We would never buy another brand because we like a great value. Why waste your money?"
3,Radar Detector - that doesn't,"The first one that I ordered was never delivered from the USA to Middle E. Because of the fact that per some 'hidden' laws of the country, these are not allowed. What I think is that somebody liked the item more than I did and he kept it. Along went my other order for a car blue tooth which according to the confiscators was also 'Illegal'. Anyway, this is the second try and it got here via a visitor.Disappointing is the thought that I spent about $80 on an item that does not work since the radars are smart and only trigger if you are in their kill zone. By that time its already late for you to correct your speed and damage is done, picture is taken etc. So I believe these things are obsolete no matter what x, y and k bands they cover! I wanted to have fun with it and now I can hear the thing chirp and beep when I drive around my compound with the traffic signal sensors are located by the device."
2,Whistler,I purchased the Whistler XTR-140 after doing some research on it's detection quality. Since I have used the device it has not once alerted at incoming or stationary police. It beeps at alot of signal lights and trucks passing by though. I gave this device 2 stars for the fact it looks fancy pancy.
2,Detects the cop car but right up close,This device is not doing what it is supposed to do. It only detects the cop car when it is very close. Anybody seen better results? I am wondering if I have it installed correctly as it is hung down a little from the front. Also there are various settings to chose from...I just chose the city one. Thanks in advance.
2,Very confusing,"I kept getting pulled over by cops & became very livid & fed up. So i decided to buy a reasonable priced radar. This thing is very confusing, the manual doesnt explain clearly on how to use it, i passed by 3 sitting cops one day and the radar didnt go off at all. I wouldnt buy this radar unless you want to continue getting tickets"
2,Disappointed at automatic default,"I bought this to replace a model from 4 years ago. Sadly, this was a step backward from the earlier version. The annoyance comes from the fact that this model (140) does not default to whatever settings you had entered prior to shutdown. Instead, it always defaults to the factory settings on power-up (highway mode), making you re-enter the mode you want. So, if you regularly drive in the city and wish to have one of the 3 city modes, you must re-enter this every time you turn on the ignition.This is a dumb, stupid design choice on Whistler's part. It would have cost them nothing to lock the mode each time at power-off."
1,broke after 5 months,"Had the radar detector for 5 months, worked great until the cord connecting the radar detector to the car broke. Bought a replacement cord and then 1 week later the the whole radar detector now will not work. gave it one star cause worked good for the first 5 months."
4,I am happy!,This product is very important for me and now I am happy. It helps me to be more attentive and don't break the law. Thanks Amazon for so good service.Grigol
5,Works good,"Only thing I didn't like about this is the battery save feature when you leave it plugged in, after a few hours it shuts off and u gatta unplug it and plug back in to get it to restart so basically every time I stay somewhere I unplug it. Also I could do without the blue LED flashes at night its kinda bright and probably noticeable when a cop is nearby its going off like crazy and I don't think there is a shut off feature for those lights I was thinking about just putting black tape on them hehe."
4,RADAR DETECTOR FROM AMAZON,"WE HAVE HAD THE WHISTLER FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES IT HAS SAVED US FROM GETTING A SPEEDING TICKET, WE ARE NOT SPEEDERS BUT SOMETIMES YOU FORGET THE SPEED LIMIT AND IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE THAT WARNING"
4,Radar,Great product! Used it immediately as I had it delivered to my hotel room while I was out on the road. On my way home it worked exactly as advertised although it's not of the high end of detectors. But I love those blue indicating lights!
4,This was a birthday present.,"For my boyfriend, it works great and he hasn't had a ticket since I bought it for him. The only thing is if you touch the wire sometimes it wil come off of the mute mode which is kinda annoying since it's really loud."
4,Good CHEAP detector,Got this for some protection on my new motorcycle. Went from a 45hp 650 single to a 1200cc twin with 110hp. I'm not a speeder but I don't want any unpleasant roadside performance evaluations/awards. This little thing isn't too bad for what it is. Don't buy it expecting a Valentine One and you'll be happy.
1,"Terrible, doesn't work whatsoever.","I used it for a week, and in that time I drove past three police officers on the freeway with radar guns pointed straight at my car. This radar detector didn't make a sound. Completely defeats the purpose of having a radar detector! It beeped and flashed at random times throughout my drive but never when there were cops around. If you want a good detector, you need to pay more than $40."
3,actual radar detector works and is not extremely noisy.,This radar detector works fine. The only problem I have is the suction cups immediately fell off and got lost so I cannot use it til I get new suction cups for it.
1,"Joke, waste of money","I tried to like this device, I really did. Here's the pros and consPros:- Loud, can change volume- Simple, easy to use- easy to mount and set upCons:- Beeps all the time, don't know how to shut upI don't know why though. I read the manual and it said it canBeep due to bumps and acceleration or something.Even when there are no bumps, it beeps for nothing, thereforeit can never give an accurate reading- It dosn't even detect a lot of troopers or city cops, I have passed numerousofficers on highway and streets and have only beeped 2/50 times, seriously.- when it beeps, it flashes blue lights also. In the day time it is okay but during night timethe flash is soo bright that I have to unplug it because you can obviously tell that someone hassome flashy thing in their car.- Passed a trooper on the higher and didn't even let me know, luckily there were other cars that was going the speedas I was. Other than that, this device is useless."
1,Stinks,"It doesn't work, my wife just got a ticket and the radar didn't even blink.Waste of money,Thanks"
5,DOES THE JOB! NO BELLS NO WHISTLES,I don't think the screen is LED. The City mode doesn't disable X Band. It simply mutes it after the radar detector beeps once. It still flashes on X band in city modes.But I will say that it does the job that need to be done. I've caught 5 cop cars by Ka Band and 1 by Laser by half a mile (at least).It doesn't have any bells and whistles nor has a fancy display but it does the job that needs to be done.I'd say go for it instead of really expensive ones.I've been using mine for about 3 weeks and buying another one for dad since we both have to do freeway driving everyday for more than hour and a half.Hope I've helped out some people to make their minds NOT to waste their money on some of the other radar detectors that cost well over $200-$300.
3,Reduces busting risks by 40 percent,"I have been using this on highways recently. It gives you warnings with about quarter to half mile in advance. You have to quickly slam on the brakes (dangerous if someone is following you). I passed through tons of cops and this unit gave alarm approximately 35% of time. May be the cops weren't using their radars rest of the times (who knows?). So, do not completely rely on this unit. I would say it reduces your chances of getting busted by about 40% which is still not bad for under 40 bucks. Make sure to mount it as low as possible on the windshield (as in the instruction manual). Cops usually point lasers on number plates or headlights. Lasers are only 3 feet in diamater. I haven't come across any laser or VG2 alarms yet. Don't hestitate to brake after K/Ka alarm. X alarms can be neglected by just lifting off the gas pedals."
3,Satisfactory,"This is an okay product. It'll alert me to when the police in the area are using rader, however, it never picks up the state troopers. I don't know if the state troopers are using laser, but even if that's the case I would expect some sort of alert and I get none. In it's defense I do know that detecting laser is much more difficult but it almost seems like false advertising to me. If this were better I would have bought another for my other vehicle but as it is I'm not satisfied enough to do that. There are a lot of false alerts on the X-band as well and it seems the X-band is more or less useless."
5,Whistler XRT-140 the simple and easy detector.,The Whistler XRT-140 is simple and easy to set up and operate. I have had more expensive radar detectors in the past 35 years. This one is plug and play. No set up or programing functions and cnfusing lingo to learn. Just plug it in and go.This radar detector is responsive and very accurate. You still have your normal automatic door opener interference as you do in $200.00 radar detectors.Don't be afraid of the low price. This is a no frills basic radar detector. That's it.
4,great value,"No complaints, great value for the price. I wish i had purchased one prior to my last ticket, which was from chp driving in other direction.I would have saved me $370.00"
4,Whistler Value,"I purchased this detector for my son who would be driving from Texas to North Carolina. That fell through and I ended up using it here in San Antonio. It works well and as described, it has it's perks. It does pretty much what others have said and is a good value for the price. It has alerted me to a few law enforcement officials and probably saved me from at least one ticket. Just remember, if you jam on the brakes - they will get you. Slow down a little and coast it out, and this detector will serve you well. Unless you want to go 20 - 30 over the limit, this gives you ample time to slow down. I usually am not more than 5-10 over the limit, so it gives me plenty of reaction time...besides, it's just nice to know the fuzz are about right?"
2,Disappointed,"The price of shipping was more than the lighter making for a product that looked good but turned out not to be worth the price.It's very hard to push the slider to cause the ignition. A child-protection device? I suppose but as an adult, I was not amused. It takes several tries to get it to ignite as well. At least my fingers get some excercise so all is not lost. Go for a cheaper item at your local $.99 store."
1,Would not recommend,"I have had problems with this from the start. I'll admit that a couple of the issues were probably my fault. I didn't realize that it came empty and needed to be refilled right away and I have had problems keeping it working. Could be that I am refilling it wrong?? Can't say. I can say that the design is awkward and the button you push up to get a flame is hard to move. Actually hurts to use! At this point, I'm happier with a disposable. So much for trying to live ""Green""."
3,Smaller than it looks,"The lighter seems to work fine although, based upon how loose the extendable tip is, it seems to be cheaply made. However, my biggest complaint is how small it is. It's more like a 3/4 scale model of the lighter I thought I was getting."
2,Great while it lasted,"I really like the design of this lighter. The extendable head gives sufficient reach for BBQs, candles, and everything in-between. The problem is that it's cheap Chinese-made junk. After about 12 uses the protective tip fell off. It still worked, but I suspect that's a safety hazard. Didn't matter though, 4 uses later the striker gave out so it won't light any more. If it were a $2 disposable I suppose it'd be fine, but I prefer refillable lighters that actually last long enough to be refilled... sigh. Won't be purchasing this again."
1,Very Bad,"Compre 2 de estos y ambos salieron muy malos son muy duros en el boton de encendido, por eso no lo recomiendo, VERY BAD!!!!! MUY MALOS!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I recieved my Maverick lighter.Yes it looks good but it said on the ad that you ""Simply slide switch forward to ignite""Well when I tried to Simply slide switch forward to ignite, it was very hard to slide...also the flame does not turn up very high???I think it was desgined for someone who has very strong fingers....."
1,do not buy,This lighter does not work. It is poorly constructed and is a waste. Do not waste your money.(one star only because I can't give zero or negative stars.)
1,Never worked well.,"Got this awhile ago and should've returned it. I remember it not working very well when I first opened the package. The switch is difficult to slide and the flame size adjuster is also hard to turn and when you do, it doesn't seem to have an effect on the flame size. Just recently it stopped working altogether. I think it has lighter fluid in it, but it's hard to tell since there's no indicator. I've attempted to fill it, the same way I fill my other, far better working, brand name lighter, but it still isn't working now. Spend a couple bucks more for the original brand, or a lot less for the cheap ones that aren't as nice looking."
2,Thin material and poor quality,"This bowl is made using thin sheet material with poor quality. It had dings all around the bottom edge of the bowl and very soft. If you try to mix anything in it by placing it on counter; it will make loud popping sounds from thin bowl flexing in and out.Approximate Dimensions:Diameter 16 inches, Depth 4 inches.I am going to return this back to the seller."
3,Thomas,My 4 year old son really enjoys this toy!! It's not for hours on end but he enjoys the logs and the helicopter most. The durability is great because he has dragged the train all over the carpet lol. I would recommend this as a starter train set.
1,Skip this one if you're a Thomas lover,"My 3 year old received this as a birthday present. Daddy had to set it up and it was fun for a couple of minutes, but then a big disappointment from then on. The plastic track doesn't work with the traditional Thomas wooden tracks and is definitely not easy for a 3 year old to assemble. Although normal Thomas trains fit, they get caught on the triggers for the timber yard and don't go around smoothly and aren't really made to run on this set. The trains aren't normal Thomas trains, but some custom battery powered plastic trains that simply look like Thomas... no familiar magnets to mix and match with the rest of the trains my son has. Instead the platic couplings for the cars are very hard to use. You can't do anything to change the configuration of this set... it goes together one and only one way. Bottom line - Skip this one and add some new cars or regular wooden track from the traditional Thomas collection."
3,The Fun Wears OFF!,"My 4yr old loved it the first few days but the fun wore off and now it is sitting in the closet. We got it at the end of January and left it set up for the first couple of weeks. Then put it away and I think we had it out a total of two times since. There isn't much of anything you can do with the set to change things around, the layout has to basically stay the same for the loading and unloading operation to work. It is fairly easy to put together but that also makes it easy for the kiddos to take apart. I would be hesitant to buy it again."
5,A Very Cute Train,"I bought this a month ago for my granddaughter to play with at Nana's house. Once I took the time to put it together right, I was so pleased with how it operates. It is so very cute picking up logs and dumping. Nice toy !!!"
4,Neo-classical Progression,"Axel Rudi pell's gutar playing amazes me, he can easily blend shredding to melodies. The carrier track ""Magic"" exhibits his technical flexibility. Killer shredding in the 1st track, nicely executed.The music characterizes melodic playing with neo-classical overtones and at times shred. I find the lyrics of the track ""The Clown is Dead"" quite amusing but then again Scott Soto's vocals blends well. To those new to the genre Axel Rudi Pell is a guitar virtuoso in the vein of neo-classical players. This CD is worth investigating."
2,"Great vocals, great drumming, POOR recording, POOR Guitars","This record has some good songs and JS SOTO's voice is excellent, the drumming by Jörg Michaels (from the excellent band stratovarius) is also very good, although the drum sound is horrible thanks to the producer...Axel Rudi Pell...He just can't produce! Everything except the vocals are horrible soundwise. And now to the real horrible part...The guitar solos....THEY SUCK! He play without any feeling and trys to play a lot faster than he can pull of...Hell, I'm even faster and have TONS more feeling thatn this guy! If he had hired a pruducer and a lead guitarist it would have been an Excellent CD."
1,Doesn't work with my Cobra CB,"I bought this mic based on the reviews I read online. Unfortunately I threw away the package before I had occasion to use it. When I keyed the mic it showed that it was transmitting, but it did not transmit my voice. My friends only heard a click. We tried switching it with a midland radio and it did the same thing. I don't know if I got a bad one or if they're all junk."
2,not all there,bought this to replace my stock mic and when i got it it was missing the screws to hold it together.so i took my stock mic screws and put in it and it didnt work out that good the mic cord kept pulling out making a echo sound when keyed up..i took it and had a new 10ft cord put on it by a cb tech and now the button is messing up..i am very unsatisfied with this d-104.and the company that sell it i sent many messages to them over it and never heard back..would i recomend it?? !!NO WAY!! the old ones were made alot better..
5,Plug and Play with old iron,"I purchased this microphone for use with a vintage Robyn SB-510D SSB mobile CB radio that used a Uniden main board. Installed the battery in the mic, plugged it into the radio and worked the first time, did not have to rewire the plug. Could not ask for better. I am amazed you can still get these microphones new today, considering the amount of times the Astatic brand of consumer goods has been passed/sold to other corporations."
5,Lives up to Astatic Reputation,"This was a Christmas gift for hubby, and he's totally satisfied with it. Although a lot newer than his old CB mic, this has the same quality as the former. He is not at all disappointed! A value!"
2,Just Not Worth the Money,"I purchased this with an ignorant idea that more power meant better modulation and boy was I wrong.......Giving that I also purchased a Astatic 636L ...I am by no means a CB wizard....The sound (modulation) produced is dry, and generic compared to the 636L...I hooked this mic up to a Galaxy 959 with mods and with the mike gain up and the variable power down it seemed lame .I tried adapting different setting and still did not sound better than the 636L.....If you want to waste money buy this mic....if you want to sound clear try the 636L .....Keep in mind with my Galaxy 959 with mods I didn't need the power mic....hence the ignorance"
2,ok i guess,"Arrived in time and in good condition.Small issues i had and still have with mic.1-the ptt switch was dirty when it arrived.I had to clean it to get rid of the sticking that was happenning.2-After putting battery in it,i noticed that the volume switch in back would not seat above the casing.Left it as is.Reports are the mic sounds good.Not the quality astatic once made.Look for a better quality mic."
4,Fresh New Sound,"I'm a big fan of Utada's Japanese work, so of course i'm estastic about her english release! Her sound is so different from all the american artists out there and really sets her apart. Her vocal range is just amazing! I'm in love with the songs: devil inside, exodus 04, about me, & hotel lobby. Ireally hope more people get to experence her music and support her even more!!!"
4,i'm surprised so many people hate this album,"my friend jessica introduced me to this album a few years ago.the first song was ""easy breezy"" and i was instantly captured by the fun, bouncy song. it was cute and made me want to dance.she burned me a copy of this cd and it has become one of my top 10 all-time favorite cds. the lyrics are racy and the songs are fun.i can see why some people would have a problem with the whole ""japan-EASY"" lyric, but who knows if she directly meant that?maybe this guy she was with in the song THOUGHT she was easy? who knows. who cares. the song is fun. i love it. the end."
2,Exodus.....the American sell-out debut,"I deeply admire Hikki's talents,but they do not show in this particular release. Her vocals are strained and the lyrics are weak. There are great club sounds in this,but her poor singing stands out too much in this. She emotes so much better in Japanese;she's not natural when singing in English. She's capable of singing well in English. Listen to her rendition of ""With Or Without You"" on MTV Japan's Unplugged. She sounds fantastic there. She's an amazing talent,so I hope she'll do well. First,she needs to put together music that genuine and true to her,not crap to appeal to an American audience."
1,STICK WITH JAPANESE,"I have been a Utada Hikaru fan since she first came out in Japan. I thought her songs were awesome and fresh. Her lyrics really meant something to me. I was excited about her US debut and it just....stinks. It's not that she doesn't speak good English, it's the sound and the lyrics. Please, Utada, stick wtih Japanese!!!!"
1,Great way to kill a career,"This album made me cringe. I was a big fan of Utada's in Japan - she helped break the norm of the traditional Minnie-mouse JPop songs that were dominating the music industry over there and really helped usher in R&B; into the mainstreem. This album is a departure from her sanity.""You're easybreezy, I'm Japanesey""....no matter how you look at it, that is just a horrible set of lyrics. I don't understand how anyone could possibly agree to sing that.I saw someone on here laud Utada for trying something avant garde and singing about what's important to her. Fine, I'll accept that maybe this is an experiement for her. That doesn't mean it's any good, though.Stay away from this album. You've been warned."
1,Didn't Like It at All!,"This album is completely disappointing. The lyrics alone are enough to make you wonder what was Utada thinking about when she made this album. Hooks such as ""You're easy breezy, and I'm Japaneesy"" made me eject the CD and put it in storage hoping that it will some day become a collector's item. Until then, I don't forsee it moving from its present location anytime soon. You have to be a die-hard Utada fan to like this CD. My friends and I couldn't find one single on the CD that we liked! Her attempt to span different music genres only placed her music square in J-Pop. I guess that could sum up this CD; just another J-Pop artist's failure trying to cross over. I do not recommend this CD at anyone not familiar with Utada."
3,Good.. but Monotonous,"I was a little dissapointed when I got this CD, I was incredibly impressed w/ her in ""Simple and Clean"" and decided to pick up her US debut album. What I found was a dissapointing CD filled w/ nothing but pop/dance/love songs. I wanted something laid back, something I could just kick back and listen to. I was hoping for some ballads or slow songs, something more mellow as in ""Simple and Clean"" but I didn't find it here. Huge dissapointment to me."
1,Not Her Best Work....,"To sum it up, some beats were good but lyrics were nonsense. She tried appealing to a wider audience; I like her for her voice and her lyrics (""Can you Keep A Secret?"" ""Traveling"" ""Simple and clean/Hikari(Light)"" and her recent single ""Passion"") She sings really well in both English and Japanese (""Fly me to the moon"") the only song I liked was ""Devil Inside"". I strongly encourage you to buy her new single its ALOT better, you know for the ones who care about the beautiful harmonies and lyrics that are much deeper than stuff like ""You Make Me Want To Be A Man""... the one i disliked most was ""the workout"" I get enough of that kinda crap in the rap that people blast outta their cars. I am very disapponted..."
4,Not one of her best moments,"Will Hikki crossover in the US? Hard to say. I have been a fan since her first single (Automatic) came out in Japan. This english-only CD is not as catchy as her other albums. It has a tendency of going all over the place - she definately beats to the beat of her own drum. Incredibly talented and awesome voice, she sounds like she is trying to be in two worlds at the same time (read the lyrics for Devil Inside, her USA debut single)...i really do like Devil Inside remixed (definetely but this cd single as it comes with several versions of the song, each one unique in it's own way)....i hope she does as well here as she has in japan (her second country as she was born in NYC)"
4,Devil Outside,"Ms. Utada came out with this CD some time ago and this is my first time hearing it. Well I got it almost 3 months ago but anyway, I think this is a very colorful CD. Some of the songs that stuck with me were Kremlin Dusk, Animato, and About me. This is interesting since I bought this CD because of 2 other songs: You Make Me Want To Be A Man and Easy Breezy. Still, I like the tempo on this Cd and it works for those who enjoy a good song."
3,well i'm going both ways..but i do love Exodus'04,"well i think this album wasn't her best work, but i mean she went for something new...hikaru's not the type of artist who always stays to the same thing...al tho i myself believe some of her other albums were better...its not like she hasnt released more good albums since then! i mean look at the ""passion-single"", and the ""keep tryin' single""!that has got to be one of the best songs that i love..and on this album, devil inside and exodus'04 were pretty good songs..and so was Kremlin Dusk...I just think you shouldnt give it a bad review because its new and at least she had the guts to try it out...and its not like the music was that bad! i mean some american music isn't half as good,(even if easy breezy was a wierd song o_O ) i'll stick to passion, simple and clean/hikari, sakura drops, uso mitai na i love you, traveling, and colors. So i give her 3 stars"
2,An average Japanese artist debuting her album in English,"Yet not a fan of Utada, I did come across this album. I think of it as an average pop album. And while I do not like the lyrics whatsoever, I did throughly enjoy the album. I do not recommend you buying this CD, yet check out her ""Devil Inside"" single ... its very enjoyble for those into dance and electronica. I frankly I like her style, yet I didn't find anything I was looking for. If your just in for the tuning and don't care for lyrics ... gor right ahead, yet please listen to the music samples Amazon offers; and along with that listen to the ""terrible"" lyrics. While Amazon does not offer ""half"" ratings I actually would give this a 2.5.AND PLEASE ALSO CHECK OUT MY REVIEW FOR HER SINGLE ""DEVIL INSIDE""."
2,Disappointing and bad,"Hikaru needs to return to her R&B/hip-hop roots. Exodus is unbearably disappointing compared to how good First Love and Distance were. This album is so over-synthesized, it's like listening to a soundtrack from the Disneyland Mainstreet Electrical Parade. I don't know if some idiot producer told her that Asians can't do R&B but that they can do synth-pop; that person needs to be fired. I've purchased Ultra Blue, keeping my fingers crossed that it will be better than this nightmare of an album. For everyone who insists that this album is brilliant, well, there is a reason that it bombed in the U.S. (other than an apparent lack of promotion by her record company)-- it is really bad. I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because parts of it are at least listen-able."
1,Absolutely Awful,"There was not single track on this album that I want to hear again. Absolutely awful and an absolute disappointment. I felt like I waited forever for Utada's next album to come out and this was not worth the wait. Could this be the end for her?? It's far too early in her career to have such a bomb as part of her releases. Something went wrong here, truely wrong."
5,Hot!,"Finally, Utada's long awaited US album has been released and it has met above and beyond my expectations! I have been listening to her since ""First Love"" and she only gets better with each release!"
3,Not very good.,"It sounds like a generic pop album. Compare this to Utada's other J-pop songs, this album can't compare. She tryed way too hard to copy american pop music. It's sad that such a great artist would lower herself to appeal to an overseas audience which for the most part failed."
3,Interesting Album,"Well for one I have been a Utada Fan for a long time and This album I have to say is very unique. It's so different from her other albums like, deep river, distance, or colors ( single verison ). I have to agree with the other reviews that state how her image is different on this album. English is not perfect even when sung so I would prefer for her to sing in Japanese like she always does. I can understand that she is becoming a prodigy here in the US and that's a good thing but that doesn't mean to totally change what you sing and write but sometimes change can be for the best. But in my most honest opinion I don't really like this album alot but it's nice to listen to something new. So if I were you I would listen to the samples first then decide on your own to see if you want it."
4,A great US debut for Utada!,"I was so excited when I heard that the number one singer in Japan, Utada Hikaru, was releasing a US album! This really is a quality CD that is consistent with Utada's genius way with music. The songs on this CD fit into many genres from pop, to R&B, to techno, to hip hop...proving that she can perform basically anything...and do it well! Some songs I really enjoyed on this album were Easy Breezy and Exodus '04. Her music really provides a fresh new perspective in the world of American popular music!"
5,I loved it!,"I've always loved Hikki, but that isn't the reason why i loved this album. It's so unique! It's a bummer it didn't make it in the US. I think if Hikki can balence her good lyrics and japanese music that she writes she can make it here!!"
4,short and blunt review..,"Fusion of techno and pop, its hard to go wrong with this album. The beats keep coming and keeps you moving, with the exception of a few slower tracks.This album actually surprised me. Taking you in a different direction than her earlier works. Which left me with mix feelings, Exodus has its strong and weak points.Disappointed in her choice of lyrics for certain tracks. Also to note some over used rhyming grows old.What makes this album worth getting is that beautiful voice. Tracks are arranged well and catchy, songs will stay in your head for days. And its her! Have to love Hikki!For fans new and old, it slowly sinks in and feels like home.If your a new fan and like this album, I suggest looking into some of her earlier works."
3,****interesting******,"I have never been so attracted to her music in Japan, (and I am a Japanese) but this album is interesting whether it is marketable or not. Many of those who are used to typical ""Hikki"" approach may find this album disturbing, simply because the music is too experimental and some lylics are too provocative.In fact, some of the songs sound very deconstructed and do not sound natural, which I personally found very intriguing. This is why I am a bit dissapointed about the entire marketing approach of ""Utada"" so far, since she is sort of packaged as ""a young innocent Japanese Girl."" I personally think she should have used more mature and provocative looking pictures on the CD cover and websites. In this sense, I found ""Easy Breazy"" quite discusting.Overall, I liked the CD. To me, listing to this CD is just like listening to Frank Zappa, Talking Heads, or Holger Czukay. (By this I do not mean they all have a same quality!) So I am not sure whether it will attract a big audience."
4,Refreshingly different.,"Utada first came to my attention when her video for ""can you keep a secret"" was played quite a few times on MTV2. i must say i was intrigued and kept her on my radar. With EXODUS i must say i was very suprised at how good it is. A fun sexy blend Dancy-electronica with a charming pop sensibilty and slight touches of hip-hop is how i would describe it. The standout for me is THE WORKOUT, fun and sexy with a great beat. My least favorite song is EASY BREEZY, the lyrics just bug me. On the strength of this album i decided to purchase Utadas greatest hits and im sure i won't be disapointed. EP"
1,EXODUS is great if you want to EXIT your music career!,"OH MY GOD IS THIS ALBUM TERRIBLE! In no way or form is this considered good ""ART"". I must completely disagree with some of the comments written by others. I know what to expect from a talented person like Utada and I have no idea why she would ruin her career in this manner. I can see how people like to experiment with new things, but there's no need to PUBLISH it as mainstream music.Exodus is childish, unpolished, and frankly it sounds like she doesn't know how to sing.If you want something to cringe to and a disc to use as a drink coaster by all means spend you 15 bucks here!"
5,Wow... just.. WOW!! xD,"There are soo many great songs in here, and they are all very very good. I love ""The Workout"", ""Kremlin Dusk"", ""Devil Inside"", ""Hotel Lobby"", ""Exodus '04"" and ""Tippy Toe!!"" If you are disappointed because you were expecting something more like her japanese songs than you have to realize that this is her AMERiCAN debut! Beacuse barely anybody knew her in the states she decided create something new and not restrict herself by her old music. If you really look at it that way, this music is something really good and different, fun, catchy, and danceable(and besides, she was popular in Japan BECAUSE she was different!!). It's .. GREAT!! =^-^= ""This is [her] Exodus o4""!"
2,Definitely not like Hikki's usual.,"When I heard that this CD was coming out, you can't believe how excited I was. I love her Japanese music, and I needed to buy this CD at all costs.This CD made me incredibly disappointed. The music was completely out of her style, and the lyrics were horrid. Hikaru Utada has a nack for music, and deep lyrics, and I know this. I just don't know what went wrong in this CD.Most songs are incredibly boring, almost tuneless with bad background music. The only thing that is still good, at least, is her singing voice, though it did sound very different in English (deeper).If she wants success overseas, I think she should stick to the kind of music she already has. Instead of trying to adapt to us, maybe we can adapt to her."
4,"Bring back the ""Hikaru""","That's pretty funny... on her latest CD she is no longer HIKARU Utada... she drops her first name, and becomes simply ""Utada""...I got ahold of ""Utada's"" latest CD last night; ""EXODUS""...I gave this one a couple listenings , and I *like* it.... it's full of new sounds and moods... She has her finger fully on the ""POP"" vien! Every tune is worth hearing. She often sounds like Madonna (if Madonna were any damn good), then she sounds like Dido... Then she gives Brittany Spears a run for the money. Yet she NEVER sounds like Mariah Carey anymore (I hated her MC phase!) ... through it all, Utada sounds like *herself*... This is (with the exception of the semi-awful ""Easy Breezy"" track), one of the BEST (non-Yoko Kanno) JPop CD's in a LONG TIME. Thanks, MB, for buying it for me! Thanks Katie for pushing Mom to get it for me! Thanks Sarah for suggesting it! I am now starting on my third listen... fun stuff!!Porco gives it 3.5 out of a possible 4 ""piggies""... RECOMMENDED!"
4,Great CD - but in the American market? Hmm...I don't know...,"I thought this was an awesome CD - but the only problem I had with it was..would this work in the U.S? I thought she could've added more American flavor...but maybe this will be the next big thing, who knows? I hope she makes it big - with her new style"
4,U Gotta Get It!,"To those who are new to Utada H., she is a popular Japanese singer in Japan. She produced 3 albums with a total of 13 singles and 'sold more than 17.6 albums'!!Her English album, EXODUS, has a ""never heard before"" flavour. It may be strange to listen to at first, but it can make you like it soon or later!!She wrote these lyrics herself except for Exodus '04 which she got help from Timbaland ^^*Release date: oct. 5 '04Exodus (English album) tracks:1. opening2. devil inside3. exodus '044. the workout5. easy breezy6. tippy toe7. hotel lobby8. animato9. crossover interlude10. kremlin dusk11. you make me want to be a man12. wonder 'bou13. let me give you my love14. about meLyrics are created by Utada herself except for #3 Exodus '04 which is by Timbalnad!!Last comments, don't just liten to the melody, listen to her lyrics as well!!!!It's like a worthy experience!"
5,Immensely Fresh and Utter Genius,"What a breath of the purest fresh air I've had in a while. Utada's U.S. debut is unique, fresh, innovative, fun, and brilliant. This is a lady who has worked and excelled at her craft, and each song has me listening with full attention. Utada has managed to blend together her Japanese dance pop sound with our Techno and R&B flavor sounds (with help from, of course, Timberland and many other accomplished producers). Her look is different (thank god, no more blondes!), her voice is enchanting, and her style is all her own. The two best tracks are ""Devil Inside"" and ""Kremlin Dusk"", but the entire album is spectacular, lets keep our fingers crossed and hope that America gives Utada a good listen. We really really really need a artist of this stature in our unimaginative industry."
2,I know most of you guys will hate me...,"... and so what? Utada Hikaru had more catchy songs in her 3 albums(not including the misc. and singles) which is First Love, Distance, and Deep River. This album IS such a big disappointment for me... I liked her songs in those other 3 album but this one...I only like Easy Breesy and Exodus 04 and thats it! But Easy Breezy and Exodus 04 AINT as great as First Love or Moving on Without You or Automatic from the album First Love, Can you keep a secret,Distance, Eternally in the Album Distance, Sakura Drops, Traveling, Deep River, ASAP, Final Distance, Hikari in the album Deep River. there are also some other songs but they are printed in japanese so...Anyways I conclude this is not the Best album for Utada...all English songs yet it is such a disappoinment..."
1,a mediocre effort from an excellent singer,"I am an Utada Hikaru fan, but I can't give this album a positive review just because I like her previous Japanese work.This album's lackluster production and trite lyrics make it a chore to listen to. The beats aren't very creative and the songs just aren't very original. I really wish that she had tried harder to make a better album for her stateside debut.I think the reason Utada even bothered making an English-language album is because record producers thought Americans couldn't handle a Japanese-language release. A ""greatest hits"" album or stateside release of her previous (and excellent) Japanese albums would have been much better than what we got with ""Exodus."""
1,:-(,"This cd was a dissapointment. I tried to give it a chance but comparing this cd to her past music (such as the very much talked about ""Simple & Clean"") it definitely does not stand up to it. At all. Some of her beats and melodies actually sounded good but the lyrics were just not there. I give it a star for one song that is I think was most appealing of the entire album, ""Devil Inside"""
1,a 15 year old who USED to be a fan of utada,"After hearing Hikaru Utada's ""Simple and Clean"" song, I was so amazed by her voice and use of rhythm that I couldn't wait to buy one of her cds. I was really excited when Exodus came out and bought it without hesitation. However, after listening to the songs and lyrics, I couldn't believe that this was the same Utada that I'd heard before. The different beats in the songs were catchy and melodic, but the lyrics were odd and distasteful. Exodus '04 and Animato are the only two songs that were ""clean"" all the way through, but songs like The Workout strongly repelled me. Then you have to look at the titles. ""You make me want to be a man""? I believe this is one of her ""image-changing"" cds, to show her fans that she can be versitile. But to those like me, who actually care about the lyrics to the songs they're singing and liked the image that she had before, I would hope that you don't make the same mistake that I did."
1,Just because I don't like it doesn't mean I'm ignorant,"Come on Sam Goody. Could you please stop labeling people as prejudiced and ignorant just because they hate this album? Tell you what, I am Asian, born and raised in Asia, and am exposed to the Asian music scene probably more frequently than you, but I just don't see how this album is anything other than Asian lollipop junk. I hate it. It's worthless. The lyrics are dumb, and there is nothing new about the sound (listen to some other ablums by other Japanese or Chinese or Korean artists and seriously they sound very much alike). So please stop labeling these people who are entitled to their own opinions, okay?"
2,"dissapointing american debut, hikki loses touch","Let me start off by saying I am one of Hikki's biggest fans.I love her voice and her range of vocals. She is one of the most talented artists in the world.Yes this cd has several great tracks like &quot;work out&quot; and &quot;easy breezy&quot; However, that is it. The beats are different. They sound too &quot;modern&quot; If you were a fan of Hikki's Deep River or First Love albums, DO NOT buy this. I spent $30 on the Japanese release because I thought it would be great but burst in tears when I heard this album. No stretch of truth there. Her voice is still great, but the beats do not match with the songs. Don't believe the hype. Buy a used copy or download it. Don't waste your money no matter how much you love hikki. This album may make it in the US mainstream, however for the japanese fans, you may end up in tears too."
2,Stupid.,"Trash, garbage. She's japanesey and this album makes me queezy. Anime geeks will love it, because you guys love japanese things. But this album is bad, Utada just got stupid. I did too for having heard Exodus. Poorly written pop music from someone who's done better."
5,Breath-taking album,"This album pushes the envelope to produce a unique, refreshing sound that sets it apart from all the pop music out there. The melodies are memorable, and the productions are complex. Don't expect Utada Hikaru. This music is another genre of itself. Animato is the perfect song to explain this album, as well as the most artistic and thoughtful. It's like if Bjork decided to release a pop album. It's a definate must buy!"
5,"UTADA, not Hikki.","First of all, I'd like to start this review by saying that people REALLY need to stop comparing Utada to &quot;Hikki&quot; or &quot;Utada Hikaru&quot; because it's a completely different persona. With that said, I'll start my review. I really like this album, but it'll probably take a few listens for you to like it also. The first time I listened, I only liked a few songs, but after a few good listens, each song shines out in a unique way...except You Make Me Want To Be A Man, which was repetitive and just not pleasing to my ears. And to the people that think this album/some of the songs are too sexual, I think this is very tame compared to some of the stuff out there today, and I think Utada is pretty clever and classy with her &quot;sexy/racy lyrics&quot;. Anyway, I definately reccommend this CD to anyone who's not afraid to experiment with their musical tastes."
5,"Weird at first, but grows on you afterward","I have been a Utada Hikaru fun for a long time. I have all her previous albums including Cubic U, First Love, Distance, and Deep River. I got this album in Japan before it was out in the US. The first few times I listen to it, it was kind of weird, nothing like her japanese albums. I was kind of disappointed. I actually expected Exodus to be like First Love :). Then I realized that Exodus is actually similar to Cubic U, the album that Utada made at the age of 16 in the US. This shows that Utada Hikaru has two styles of music. Other people who give her 3 stars or less just have not got use to her US style yet. I am sure you won't regret giving this CD. You might not like it first, but you will definitely like it when you listen to it more. The songs are witty and grows on you. Well, at least for me, the more I listen to Exodus, the more I like it."
4,Utada Hikaru brings us something unique.,"If you are like me, Coco Lee's first English language album, ""Just No Other Way"", left me feeling a little under whelmed. At first Utada's album, ""Exodus"" left me with similar impression, but there is a big difference; while Coco was attempting to just blend into the R&B; mix, Utada with her Asian themed tracks stand out. Though the lyrics of some of the songs are written to appeal to the Asiaphile, if you listen to this album a few times, you will find yourself singing along. ""You're Easy Breeze and I'm Japanesey""Like many others have commented, this does not represent Utada's best work, but ""Exodus"" is none the less quite unique and worth the money."
4,"Does the job, I guess!","Since I didn't have any problems with my DVD player before I ""cleaned it,"" I am assuming that it's doing the job, so I'm satisfied with the product.Even though the description says ""mini"" and the size is listed as ""8 cm,"" I didn't pay attention, so I didn't expect the disc to be so small. I just assumed that it was a normal-sized disc, so I thought at first that I had mistakenly purchased a camcorder-only cleaner. Luckily it's compatible with any tray that has an 8 cm ""groove."" But it says it is NOT FOR USE in laptops, notebook PCs, PlayStations, or GameCubes.The cleaner uses a single brush to clean and says it should be good for ""up to 30 cleanings."""
1,Good music from the movie is absent form this disc,"As a high school student looking to major in musical composition in college, I purchased this CD for its beautiful main theme (written by Camille Saint-Saens and adapted for the movie) and was horribly disappointed to find that theme has very limited playing time. Right from the very first track, the regal and majestic intentions of Saint-Saens are destroyed by a trio of rats singing his work. What is that????? Get rid of the barnyard choir, I want real, quality music of a real orchestra. There is also too much talking. I want the music that appeared in the movie, instead I got the character's voices rambling for half the CD."
5,Excellent for teaching the West Texas pioneer experience.,"The rich heritage of the West Texas pioneer experience is chronicled in this little-known novel of a young couple who settle in a dugout in the Texas Panhandle during the 1880s. The love story of Wade and Bethany Cameron unfolds as they struggle to survive blizzards, droughts, prairie fires, and loneliness. Too often, the nester has been ridiculed and maligned; this novel portrays the dignity and determination of these hardy pioneers who are indeed our great-grandparents. I use the novel in my 7th grade English class, and my students love it. Years later when they come back to visit me, they never mention the grammar we studied, but they always mention this book."
1,No Plot,I started reading this book and thought it was going to start off slow. It wasn't slow just in the beginning... I think it was a horrible pointless book.
5,super book Sicilian cooking,"very neat book - gives a nice broad range of Sicilian cooking ; although this is my first Sicilian cook book , what i mean is it covers pastas, sauces, fruit, pastries , not many of each , but a nice selection and gives some history of the island, the people, and the food influenceshighly recommended , not like most other cook books, these are recipes from actual Sicilians, that live there ;the author traveled to Sicily , met Sicilians, interviewed them , and the result is Giovanna's basic red sauce, etc.,really nice touch"
2,Mediocre,This book is big on pictures and short on recipes. Only buy on a discount or used. There are better sicilian cooking books out there.
3,Fans Only,This is the older style of Robby. If you are a fan of his newer stuff you may want this just to compliment your collection otherwise it is just ok.
1,Watch Out,"I ordered the BROWN metallic watch for my daughter at Christmas and they sent a Nike Presto Cee SILVER metallic watch. Maybe they thought I would not notice. Order one thing and get something different, what a bummer. I will never order from TimeZone123 again!"
3,Egypt by an expert,This historical novel is about the Roman emperor Hadrian's visit to Egypt with his favorite Antinous. There is a lot about the early Christians in it. The homosexual nature of the relationship between Hadrian and Antinous is just barely hinted at. This book was written in Germany in the 1880's by an Egyptologist who also wrote other historical novels about Egypt.
3,Not great...but not bad either...,"Generally an entertaining novel; however, the ending wasn't a surprise. The question of Bo's birth-father was never much of a mystery...fairly evident early on in the book. Armin's journey to this discovery also led him to more fully understand many of his life's relationships."
1,unbelievably bad,"Don't bother with this dreck. Might be the worst book i've ever read.Author: please don't quit your day job.If you need help falling asleep, here's the solution."
4,the mamouth book of how it happened,"Great book to just pick up amd read a section, amd put it down, later pick it up and read somewhere else in the book. HUSBAND LOVES IT?"
3,Not our favorite,"Melissa and Doug make great floor puzzles for kids. This one however is a rare miss. Really, the only drawback is that the pieces aren't made to fit together snuggly unless they are surrounded by other pieces, which is a problem for kids. It's very durable and colorful but I'd probably go with another option if I had one."
1,I would not buy it,"Some continents (Europe, Asia, and Australia) are deliniated incorrectly. I would not want my kids to be misinformed about basic geographic concepts."
3,I like it but the children not so much,the children are used to the puzzle pieces that fit into each other; this one is more like they just sit next to each other but don't interlock. I think the fact that it interlocks helps the children understand those pieces go together.
2,"Love M&D products, not this one.","We own a billion other Melissa & Doug products and have been very satisfied, except for this one. My daughter LOVES puzzles and our globe at home so this seemed to be a good fit. The HUGE problem with this puzzle is that it was cut VERY strangely. It is even difficult for me to keep the puzzle together. I would not recommend this product for that reason."
4,fun education,my kids love it they are teaching each other the countries. they are chalenging each other to learn the contents
5,Terrific,My two darling granddaughters and myself sit on the floor to put this amazing puzzle together and we have so much fun. Plus it is a learning tool to teach them about where places exist.
4,Best for the younger ones.,"The puzzle is very colorful, and my nearly 3-year-old son also loves the pictures. The oversized pieces were easy for him to grasp. We also gave our accidental extra one to my 5- and 7-year-old niece and nephew for Christmas, and they loved it, as did their school teacher mommy. Because I want to eventually teach my children proper geography, the puzzle will do for now, even though the border between Asia and Russia is not correctly identified, as per a few other customer's reviews. Several of the puzzle pieces are kind of weird-shaped, and it made putting the puzzle together for both my son and I a bit of a challenge. I wish they had made the whole thing a regular interlocking puzzle, the most annoying factor for me. By doing it this way, I think they were trying to make it easier to identify the continents, but that didn't work out well for us, especially when trying to do it on the carpet. The pieces would not stay together. Overall, I think it was a good buy though."
5,Great product,I got this for my parents so that they can exercise their minds when they are bored at home. Before I realized it the whole family was using it. Very good quality pieces and good workmanship; made with pride and it shows it. The pieces are a bit on the large side but great for people with eyesight problems.
1,awful,"I generally love Melissa and Doug products, but this puzzle is absolutely awful. The pieces simply don't fit together well and my five year old got extremely frustrated (and so did I!). There are much better puzzles out there compared to this one."
1,Very difficult to put together -- even for an adult,"The inside pieces of this puzzle are very difficult to put together because of their shape, even if you know geography. My son is not interested in this puzzle at all, and he loves the USA map puzzle and the solar system puzzle. Instead of this puzzle, I recommend The Learning Journey Map of the World puzzle.The Learning Journey Puzzle Doubles Puzzle & Poster Series Map of the World Floor Puzzle"
5,cool,"It is a very big floor puzzle. Not your normal jigsaw a very big jigsaw puzzle. My son loves ,he is four and enjoy doing it. good quality."
1,Almost worthless,"I picked this up figuring it might be worth the deeply discounted price I paid; I'd thumbed through it and it seemed insightful, notwithstanding the blatent self-help title and cover. As I read through it, though, I kept waiting for the author to start putting his rambling, meandering musings together into something reasonably coherent and practical, but he never does. In fact, the more I read, the less coherent the book became, sounding more and more like a psychologist pacing in his office, dictating his random thoughts, before moving on to some other, more lucrative task. The ideas are very elementary, and tend to be repeated and illustrated with overly obvious stories, suggesting that the author was trying to stretch already thin material into a book. I'm not familiar with the author's other books; perhaps he has some interesting ideas but has expressed them already elsewhere. I'm not motivated to find out now."
2,"Great songs, arrangment; weak performance","Like Burt Bacharach, Williams has always insisted on doing vocals on his albums, despite the fact he can barely sing. Williams does give a credible performance here, much improved since the early days, but the album could have been vastly better as an instrumental or a collection with guest vocalists -- known or unknown. Indeed, it's a missed opportunity to turn what is basically a vanity album into a collection of hit tracks. For example, the wildly underrated ""Rainbow Connection"" (from 1979's ""Muppet Movie"") offers the best musical arrangement to date here. But it needs a break-out performance by an A-list vocalist (Lea Salonga, Peabo Bryson, etc.) to make it an adult contemporary hit. Five stars for the music and lyrics. Five stars for the arrangements. One star for the vocal performance. Overall, a 2 star experience."
4,"A Guide to Understanding Land Surveys, 2nd Edition","I am a Professional Land Surveyor who bought this book 7 years ago before I was licensed. I enjoyed it thoroughly as a student, it was very well written and interesting. It is focused towards the novice or lay-person, not very technical and it was easy to understand. I still keep it as the best reference for writing legal descriptions that I own."
2,Very disappointing,Warning: The arrangements in this book are NOT good. The quality of the arrangements was suprisingly disappointing. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for anything more than the chords for these songs (some of which are questionable).
3,An okay product,Its an okay product but I had issues with it leaking air as soon as I got it out of the box. I had to put epoxy around one of the connections so I wouldnt have to send it back again. It seems to work!
3,So-so? Why so-so?,"It's reviews like these that make me wonder if I have the stuff, so to speak, to be a critic. A huge Sondheim fan, and an unabashed admirer of the Trotter Trio's ...In Jazz series (especially Passion . . . in Jazz and Star Wars . . .in Jazz)I can still not clarify exactly what it is about this disc that I don't like. Now, don't get me wrong, it's certainly worthwhile for the Sondheim enthusiast. As always, the Trio's musicianship is solid and the song selection is well-thought out. The music itself, it would seem, would also make for an excellent jazz CD. So why does this one leave me a little cold?I'm not sure, but something in the arrangements, whether it's too much faithfulness to the originals (a trait that Passion . . . in Jazz most definitely did not have) or something else that my untrained-in-Jazz ears cannot discern, something is indeed missing from this disc. For Sondheim or Company fanatics - a must have, of course. For the curious - I'd pass"
3,Great for DJ's,"The mixes on this are OK for listening at home, in your car etc...IF...you are a huge fan of the Gipsies. However, three cuts of Bamboleo (all very good for the club scene or your parties) is a bit much for regular listening. And, two of the three cuts of Djobi, Djoba sound very similar. The final cut ""Inspirational"" is an instrumental version of Bamboleo...wonderful!!!All-in-all, don't buy it for regular listening (expensive), but if you want something different or better yet, if you are a DJ looking for something different for your audience...buy it!"
4,"A standard read for all serious photographers, even in 2012","Ansel Adams deserves a lot of credit for getting photography recognized as an art as well as technical advances in the field. Even though he worked with film (mainly black and white), and large format cameras, the principles he discusses in this book ""The Camera"" as well as his other books are still relevant today and found in modern incarnations in digital cameras, Photoshop, and the like.For anyone who is serious about photography and interested in understanding the underpinnings more deeply in order to take better photos rather than editing them into a better state afterwards, I recommend this book.I do however have to include the comment that Ansel Adams, while an artistic genius, was also very detail oriented and his writing, while enlightening, is sometimes dry and tedious.-William Milberry"
2,Had potential but disappointed in the end,"I've been playing AA since beta and I've seen it grow in unique ways but unfortunately, the game is still plagued by numerous bugs and requires some serious tinkering. In the one day since the game went live, I re-recorded over 80 issues that any player will encounter in the game. This issues plus hundreds more have been given to the dev team many times but they are haven't given us the slightest sign that they are aware of the issues or are going to address them.Like other players that I've talked to, they are also disappointed with the performance of the game and the frequent lag that you'll experience while driving and especially in any town. I will continue to play the game for the first month as it's free but after that, if there's no improvement then my friends and I are leaving."
1,This online game is now shut down.,"The Auto Assault servers shut down as of the end of August 2007. With no single-player capability, this game will no longer function."
4,Don't judge a game by it's beta test!,"It's a pretty cool game, definately not like the other MMORPGS on the market, I mean, you don't have to point and click press a few buttons, and boom you're done, you gotta actually *move* This game has a lot of protential, okay, there's lag (Especially a game with this much movement), there's bugs too. But it just released, what can you expect the first days out?"
1,Not made in England - Spode Soup Rimmed Bowls,"I did not know, until I received my rimmed soup bowls, that Spode is now being made outside of England. Much to my dismay, my 'made in Malaysia' bowls do not nestle together with my other bowls that were made in England. The bowls made in Malaysia are also of inferior quality, with flaws and unevenness in the pottery itself. They are slightly smaller than my original Spode bowls. I am very unhappy with my purchase, but did not know, at the time, to ask if they were made somewhere other than England. I will not make that mistake again.As soon as I can afford to, I will be replacing these inferior bowls with the real - made in England - soup bowls. Reputable sellers should include whether their Spode is made in England or elsewhere."
2,Chip on the back edge of the bowl,"Love the bowls but one of them was chipped on the back edge of the bowl. I have not been able to find the right place to file a complaint or to get a replacement, I do not want to go to the trouble of shipping the bowl back. Dissapointed it did not arrive in perfect condition. These bowls are expensive and I expected better."
5,Their little-known masterpiece,"Better than Leftoverture...better than ""POKR"" Masque embodies everything that was great about Kansas. Modern fans of Dream Theater and Fates warning would learn where progressive metal came from..and although I like those 2 newer bands,the songwriting is merely complex arena rock compared to the dark,moody,almost medieval textures of ""Child of innocence"" and ""Mysteries and Mayhem"". Even the creepy cover art contributes to the mood. On this album you will hear the absolute antithesis of the sappy proto-new-age of Yes and Starcastle. This album, with the exception of ""it takes a woman's love to make a man"" was heavy, complex and suprisingly dark. Leftoverture and Point were great albums, but this is the kansas your sister DID'NT like. Buy it and worship."
4,Not bad at all...,"- Alan Howarth's last Halloween score wasent as bad as people want it to be. First you listen trough the entire CD, then you find the best tracks (No.1 was really good)... And after you've sorted out the tracks from good and bad, you copy thosse tracks to a own CD (CD-recorder and volume disscounts are availble), and you enjoy them..."
4,when you hear it and get lost in the words,there is just one song on there that is always on repeat. its heaven.
5,SHE THE GREATEST,"Her work is moving, simple(well sometimes), clever, and easy on the ears. She is everything desireable in a female role: HUGE talent, great voice, good looks, good attitude, a bit fysty, and just enough gurl next door in her. Her music inspires most of her listners to go out and be better! She is a good role model who never set low goals and this album proves it. Its a wonderful album, my favorite in my cd collection! WAY TO GO JEWEL!"
5,"""This Way"" to an awesome new sound for Jewel","Jewel does it again! That is, presents listeners with another beautiful CD. collection of a very eclectic group of songs, This Way has a little something for everyone. From the country-type rock of ""Cleveland"" to the intimate live version of ""Gray Matter"", Jewel shows off her talents both vocally and lyrically. Take a chance on ""This Way"" and Jewel won't let you down."
2,CORPORATE GREED - this is not music by Jewel.,"This album...has to be the most boring and unpleasant pieces of music that I've heard in a while. Only reason I gave it two stars is because some of the lyrics are heartfelt, but it seems that the executives at her recording company tried to make this album ""poppy"" instead of the folky gal that she is. It really is horrible when corporate greed gets into music, but whatever floats her boat."
3,It's too bad,"She's reached the stage of being over-produced, too much emphasis on all the production and musicians instead of on what's real about Jewel -- her voice, her guitar and her words. It's too bad the other songs here couldn't have been like the last two, the add-on's, the bonus tracks, which are the best two tracks on the album."
1,This album is not good!,"Dont Buy this album, its really not good. She sold out on all her fans. What are we to do? Its boring and repetitive. Gosh, she bleached her roots for the final time? Her folk roots are gone. What happened? I AM VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ALBUM, AS MANY OF HER FAITHFUL FANS ARE!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"""This Way"" Makes People wonder, Which Way?","Jewel seems undecided about which ""way"" she wanted this CD to go. From the popsy radio-hit ""Standing Still,"" Jewel strays to a wont, needy ""Everybody Needs...,"" to a nostalgic ""Do You Want to Play"" to an almost-country ""Cleveland."" She even dabbles a little in jazz in ""I Won't Walk Away."" Her strong, rich voice has always struck people as assertive and confident, yet the lyrics of these songs generate a sense of the instability of youth. The songs on this album change erradically in styles and emphases. THE VERDICT: Jewel must now decide which way she wants to take her career."
2,Wisely Preachy,"i always considered myself a big fan of her. now, no longer.you know, she released 'this way' on November 13, 2001. it took 2 months to be released in Indonesia, where I live. i was so upset when i listened to her new cd. it sounds experimental and a bit weird. her voice doesn't match country music. and i hate the lyrics. she sounds so wise...and preachy, and cynic, too. as if she KNEW everything in the world. i think she wanted people to agree with her, raising her new standards...but that doesn't come easily!"
2,Jewel Falls to Pieces and loses her Spirit..,"Jewel's first two albums are wonderful. The lyrics on the previous have been written with soul, passion, and pain. This album lacks everything that Jewel is. The only good songs on this album are ""Standing Still"" and ""Break Me"". Other then that Jewel has lost her folklore touch and sounds like a manufactured pop product. I am very disappointed and hope her next release is better then this."
5,Excellent album!,This was the first Jewel album I ever purchased. Her music is beautiful and relaxing. She's a very talented artist and her choice of songs for this album is excellent. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this genre of music.
2,The day Jewel sold out.....,"Somewhere between Jewel's first great albums and this one, she decided to sell out, and what's sad is that she sold all of her fans.....all of us......out with her....this supposedly creative and long-awaited CD represents one of the more astounding sell-outs of all time, given Jewel's potential..."
2,very Middle of the Road,I've Heard all of Jewel's Music&nothing really moves me on a whole.I find Her Material fairly Ordinary.Her Vocals never go anywhere&the Arrangements stay Fairly Basic.I Don't Find Her Songwriting that challenging &She plays very Close to the Formula here.
1,Very disappointing,"This album was a sore disappointment. Key gripes, 1) completely over-produced sound, 2) terrible instrumentals that overshadow Jewel, and 3) the worst... lyrics I've heard, which is the worst disappointment considering I usually like Jewel's songwriting."
4,inspiring songs,"Jewel is a great artist because she is so sensetive and always express her feelings through songs. Listening to any Jewel CD is always an interesting experience, because you have the impression that in each song you know her better. ""This way"" is CD with a positive message, pop songs and folk music, which is the best she does. The first single ""standing still"" is great and surely is being pushed by the excellent video, in which jewel tries to find the club she'll be playing in a small town. I also liked ""Do you want to play?"", a pop song with the potential to become an upcoming single. The live tracks are good, and very intimate. If you bought jewel previous CDs, this is one that you must have in your collection."
5,the more it changes........,"I loved Pieces of You. I loved Spirit. I love This Way.This way is very different from her previous two cds in a way very similar to how different ""Spirit"" was from ""Pieces of You"" The connecting points of the 3 cds are Jewel's beautiful, angelic voice; and her deep artistic lyricism. Jewels' thoughts are so beautifully revealed in every song like a flower opening to the light of day. I must respond to the other reviews that state that this CD is a little ""country"". It is. a little. I do not care for country music,and I love this one. so don't worry about it!!"
4,Great CD,I loved all the songs. They made feel good about music again. Your one few that still produce awsome music.. Thanks..
5,WOW----------HOW AMAZING?,"this is with out doubt the most amazing album ever. every song is amazing. hairs on the back of your neck stuff. tracks 1, 2 and 8 are breathtakingly good. the best purchase i ever made.worth ever penny of the 20 import price. if u like jewel buy it. if u love her. u already got it. but if u never heard of her buy it.... its amazing. you will fall in love immedaitely. just like me!please everyone buy this and make her as famous in the uk as she deserves to be. i want her in ever paper on ever programme and in every magazine. she is too good to let the americans keep to themselves. the other albums are almost amazing too.the whole album id better than spitit and pices of you. in general that is. however they have songs of pure pleasure. ""down so long"". ""you were mesnt for me"". OH WOW! cant say any more. amazing.stunning. gobsmacking."
4,The Best Jewel CD!,"I have all of Jewel's CDs, even the Christmas one and this is my favorite! Some of the songs are typical Jewel, but many of them are very different from her usual style. It's like a combination of Rock, Pop and Country. It's obvious that a lot of effort was put into this album. The song ""Standing Still"" is especially beautiful."
2,a rough cut Jewel,"Jewel is at her best on beautiful songs that show off her voice. Here Jewel has put away the production and ends up with an album that is trying to be more rock.Sheryl Crow is MUCH better in this territory...as is Amanda Marshall, and Indigo Girls. Jewel simply isn't suited for this sound... and it shows.If this was an attempt at credibility it was not needed. Jewel has shone as a pop star but comes up dull on rock music.Save your money and wait for the new Sheryl Crow album!"
1,Who really listens to Jewel?,"Corporate music! Jewel is blonde and pretty but very boring music to listen to. The new adult contemporary wave is really boring and sounds rather conservative to ""real"" music lovers. I know the AC format and Jewel is just fill-in music you're on hold with a customer service agent or in a bank lobby. She's folk music, not AC. Want to go to sleep? Listen to Jewel! Zzzzzzzzzz."
2,Could be better,"The hit song ""Standing Still"" is little more than a rewrite of Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"", and the rest of the disc does little more to inspire. Not one of my favorites."
3,deka,dear jewelyour album is great.but i think your second album is the best. i really like to hear you singing last song on your album this way.and i can see that your voice is little differend than your album before this(this way).i like your album and i'll wait your next album.thank you for making this album.hidup jewel .ok.
2,Was expecting more,"I've never bought a Jewel CD before. Although I have followed her career since she was 14 and have enjoyed most of her mainstream releases, until they were played to death by insensitive top-40 DJs.I bought this album for two reasons: I thought it would be like her pop releases, and I really LOVE that ""Standing Still"" song. Unfortunately, that seems to be the only song that I like. As with Shania Twain, once I get past the released singles, I find it to be just too much for my old Rock-n-Roll soul.As a classically trained musician, I have trouble appreciating country music (and rap for that matter too) as a valid form of the art."
3,Standing Still is the only good song,"This is not Jewel's best cd by any rational standards. The album ""Spirit"" was MUCH better than this one (I even like the Christmas album better). The single ""Standing Still"" is wonderful, but that's the only ear-catching song on the whole cd.Don't get me wrong. I love Jewel, and I am glad that she is still putting out new cds, but she really needs to expand a little on her style. She includes a lot of songs from her pre-fame career, and that seems to suggest that her heart really wasn't in this effort. None of the songs on this cd have the appeal of her songs ""Hands"" or ""You Were Meant For Me."" B-"
1,Thin-voiced Jewel reveals her limitations.,"On Jewel's third album Jewel does not stray from her painfullyannoying little-girl voice, even when it is clear that her voice can be pure and earthy. Most of the songs are forgettable except for rockers such as ""Serve the Ego"" and ""Love Me, Just Leave Me Alone."" A surprisingly disappointing album from a singer who professes herself to be artistic but only provides a bland aftertaste."
4,"Good, but not her best","I think this album is very good, and jewel's voice is beautiful,but I think she could've done better. This is probably her most upbeat album, and her most ""pop"" album to date. My fave tracks are serve his ego, break me, and standing still, but all the tracks are solid. The good thing about this album is that since it has a bit of a poppy sound to it, it can appeal to people who r new to jewel. But it still has the older jewel elements, so her older fans will enjoy this."
4,More brilliance,"This album is pure Jewel brilliance.She has a knack of being able to change the sound of her voice to suit the dynamics of the lyrics.Soulfull, sweet, hard rock and easy going are ways to desribe the feeling that stands out when jewel is singing her songs.Not an easy thing to do.There are not many artista who can achieve such an amazing thing one one album.The songs are new and interesting, some are pure jewel but the style has changed for the better.Jewel has taken on an almost country sound in a couple of her songs which I actually quite like.Very easy to listen to and the songs always have great lyrics not the run of the mill ""he loves her, she loves him"" type of stuff.Jewel has an interesting mind and the way she sees life is sung about in well sung songs with music to keep you entertained.Put it on while relaxing or great for driving to.Thumbs up!"
5,I would buy a CD of Jewel singing scales!,"I am a biased reviewer as I LOVE everything Jewel has done. I have even converted my husband who only listens to country. As usual, this is another great album. Jewel has the loveliest, most pure voice and I could listen to ""Break Me"" ten thousand times and still love it (like I did with her ""Ave Maria"")."
1,is she for real?,"I am a HUGE Jewel fan. I couldn't of imagened she would have an album I wouldn't like...SURPRISE! Not only do I not like this album (not one stupid song, and trust me they are stupid), I almost wish I could get my money back. Huge disappointment. On one song she rattles off lyrics about a guy being a 'turtleneck' and someone else being a carwreck. Even the music sucks. save yourself the time and money...I listened to this cd four times, wanting so much to like it, now it sits in the bottom of my garbage pail, where it belongs."
3,Falling star.,"All right, I thought Jewel was something unique when her debut ""Piece Of You"" was released. She had a sound all her own, and I thought there was going to be some exciting future material to hear from her. But, with her second cd, ""Spirit"" it seemed this unique talent would have to wait. Now, with ""This Way"" Jewel appears to be heading in a more pop direction, less folky than her first cd. She seems to be making music for the masses, and I am not sold on her new release. I can't remember any of the tracks other than ""Standing Still"" and this was the same problem I had with ""Spirit"" which only had ""Hands"". Since I but a lot of music each year, I expect something more than a sing-by-numbers approach to music making. Will Jewel ever deliver the goods and make a cd that pairs her unique style with music that complements it? Not this time anyway."
5,Favorite by far,"This is my favorite Jewel album by a long shot. It had a little rock, pop, folk, and even early bits of country on it. Her current focus is more country now and this plays into that well."
3,This Way Review,"After seeing Jewel in concert at the Red Rocks here in Denver, Colorado, it's a fact that this young lady has the knack for composing songs. In this CD, ""This Way,"" she continues to utilize her poetic creativity to carry the theme. The optomistic outlook she brings to her real life situations gives listeners a peace of mind and lot of motivation. This CD keeps the saga going and will only ensure people of more to come from Jewel.DJ Woogie FreshG~Flow/ BEEHVIEIt would be nice to get more information on the website she started designed to help out local musicians."
4,Great CD!,"This CD definetely took Jewel in a different direction. The first single ""Standing Still"" is the catchiest tune on the album, and my favorite.-Don't be fooled though, there are many great songs on this album. Jewel's songwriting is in a premiere place. A place that could help her stick around for many years to come.-""This Way"" is a soft song, with much potential. It is my second favorite cut on the record. Jewel sticks to her expected style on this album, but goes outside her boundaries with some songs. She definetely has a good perspective on life, and she is definetely a true artist. ""This Way"" is no ""Pieces of You,"" infact I doubt anything can compete with that one, but it is definetely another musical masterpiece by an incredible artist.-I give this album 4 stars, because I believe A FEW of the songs could have been changed to be more listener friendly, but overall it IS an incredible album!-Great Job Jewel!"
5,WHOA! Indescribable!,"I've never heard Jewel before this. My dad heard her on the radio and recommended her. My teenage dangersense told me that it would be [bad] but boy was I wrong! ""This Way"" is something else, and I've never heard anything like it before (I usually listen to anything between Britney-pop to Creed to Vivaldi). I LOVE, I LOVE, I LOVE this album! Jewel sings with feeling. The majority of the songs are sentimental, but in a light way that makes you more contemplative than sad. 'Do You Want To Play' stands out because it sounds happier and louder than the rest, and is also one of my favourites. Other favourites are Standing Still, This Way, Serve the Ego...ah, to heck with it! The only song I don't like is Track 3! BUY THIS ALBUM NOW! BUY! BUY! It doesn't matter if you're starving on the streets, as long as you can bring a discman and this album with you! :)"
3,Disappointed!,"This is by far Jewel's worst work. I'm not saying it is bad, but it could be better. This eclectic mix didn't work. I was expecting to see Jewel returning to the folk sound of her first album with this new one, but I was wrong. I guess a novice to Jewel can easy like ""This Way"", but not someone who knows her music since the very beginning.""Pieces of You"" stills her best."
4,Jewel rocks!,"Just picked up a copy of This Way today and can't put it down. I have never been that big of a fan of Jewel, but this album is surprisingly great. The song Standing Still is what made me purchase the album. There are plenty of other great songs to listen to besides Standing Still (the single currently getting plenty of airplay). My favorites are Standing Still, This Way ( this was featured on a recent Dawson's Creek episode and it should be her next single), Break Me, Do You Want to Play, and I Won't Walk Away. This is one album where you don't have to skip over a lot of the tracks and it is very easy to listen to. Mainly will appeal to the pop audience I am sure. Check out This Way and you won't be disappointed."
4,Jewel...Need I say more?,"It's pretty simple: if you liked Jewel before, you'll like Jewel now. I think the songs on ""This Way"" needed more of the tempo found on ""Pieces of You."" My favorite song, by far, is ""Jesus Loves You;"" I recommend it to all those left-of-center moral relativists like me."
3,Interesting lyrics,"I bought this CD because I heard ""Standing still"" on the radio and really liked it. I have since found ""Cleveland"" and ""Grey matter"" to have excellent lyrical content. It is at least worth a listen."
5,Jewel - This way,"I love Jewel. She is the icon of a beautiful soul. This way, is more of light's brilliant spectrum from preciousness, that could only be Jewel - jsh/CamasWindsMusic"
5,Worth the wait,"What is there not to love about Jewel's new release ""This Way""? I have waited anxiously for this new cd, and I am not disappointed. It is obvious her style has evolved some; some cuts are jazzy, others with a hint of country, while some are still classic Jewel with her acoustic guitar and poetic lyrics. If you have read any of her books, you will catch some of the lines from those in a couple songs, which makes the true Jewel fan feel that much closer to her. She remains true to herself, while offering up something very fresh and exciting. Her honesty is endearing, and her talent is without question. Buy this cd - you won't regret it!"
3,Worth Buying,"This CD would really get 3 1/2 stars from me, but I couldn't put that. It's a pretty good CD, but I think I was expecting more because of how good 'Pieces of You' was. 'This Way' is a little more country and I can't relate to the song lyrics on this CD as much as I could to some of Jewel's other songs. Overall, though, I would reccommend buying this CD.This CD has a lot of good songs on it, but I like 'Standing Still', 'Break Me' and 'Serve the Ego' best. I like the lyrics and the way those songs are put together. The only songs I really skip over when listening to this CD are 'Jesus Loves You' and 'Till We Run Out of Road'. I don't really like the beat those songs have. Overall, though, most of the songs on this CD are worth listening too."
3,"JEWELS ""SPIRIT"" IS NOW GOING ""THIS WAY""","Haven't I heard this album before?....Oh, yes this sounds like ""Spirit"".Jewel is a wonderful singer, with her own style, however she has put it right back into her latest effort ""This Way"".There are no surprises, just the same Jewel, singing the same songs, with the same monotone, the same hooks, the same guitar strings, the same production, the same arrangement...shall I go on.If you have ""Spirit"" save your money. If you don't have ""Spirit"" buy ""This Way"", its the latest from Jewel however the same album as her last.Her first single ""Standing Still"" is one of the weaker songs on this album. Still a good effort, but I just wish Jewel would try some other direction then the same one.""This Way"" is a safe bet to keep the ""Spirit"" in check."
2,This Way is The Wrong Way,"I've been a fan of Jewel ever since I've heard ""Foolish Games"" in her first CD, ""Pieces of You"". I liked most of the songs in that CD, and ALL of the songs in her second CD, ""Spirit"".""This Way"", however, leaves a lot to be desired. While ""Standing Still"" definitely made me buy her CD the day it came out, the other songs seem to be lacking. She wants it to be more rock and roll and eclectic but in doing so, the lyrical content of her songs waned and lack any meaning and depth that her songs like ""Innocence Maintained"" and ""Absence of Fear"" had.If you liked her previous two CDs, this is not the CD for you. However, if you're new to Jewel, maybe you'd like this CD. After all, that's the reason she changed her style and content in her songs."
1,Not One Good Song On this One!,I find this cd annoyingly boring and bland. Not one song on it is worth listening to in its entirety. She needs a new producer and some new ideas. Her first album is still her only good album. Here's another one that is being sold to a used cd store.
1,Serious Musicians Will Despise Jewel's Selling Out!,"I have been a fan of Jewel's from the beginning. I have performed some of her music. I deeply appreciated her first two albums, and, particularly, ""Spirit."" The albums were filled with her sweet voice, intricate acoustic guitar, and social, spiritual, and psychological themes. It was good folk music. Now, she's sold out. This is a watered-down album, meant to appeal to the masses, mainly CD-buying teens. I can hear this on any pop station. It lacks substance. Where I do hear acoustic guitar, it doesn't sound like her playing it. There are boring, repetitive riffs. It hurt to listen to it. I couldn't make it past Track 6. I want to line my trash with it. I know this won't be a popular opinion, but I think that musicians who appreciated her first works will be sorely disappointed. Anyone want to buy this off of me?"
4,GREAT Music! Only problem is that much of it is missing!,"The music for the film The Net by Mark Isham is fantastic! It is wonderful! Great job Mr. Isham!! I love both the movie and the soundtrack! The music itself gets 5 out of 5 stars as does the movie, however much of the music from the film was left out of this product which is why I give it 4 out of 5. This soundtrack feels kind of short and has basically the main highlights from each part of the film. I wish they would re-release this soundtrack, but with all of the music from the film instead of just some.Let me emphasize how wonderful the music is however! Definitely worth every penny! I am just a really big ""The Net"" fan and wish I owned every cue of the music (with the score ideally)."
4,Great approach to jamming,"Happy and Artie take a good look at helping you get going right away on jamming the blues. The approach and instruction is easy enough for any guitar player to follow, and will have you jammin in no time."
5,don't slip mr. mailman watch out for my dog,their first albulm was amazing and this one is even better...this albulm portrays more of what you will hear livecrazy overtones and infathamable style..love this band
2,Am I Missing Something?,"I don't know, I guess its possible that because I don't experiment with chemical drugs I don't get this album, but it just does not win me over. I found their first album 'La Masion de Mon Reve' to be even less aurally satisfying than this one. By all means, I give them credit for doing their own thing and using random samples as accompaniement, but I just find it all comes out very cheap sounding; that and to me, one of the two singers sounds like a witch; or demonically possessed. For creativity this album isn't bad but for the overall product I was disappointed. For the songs that didn't sound like a bad Bjork impression like 'Tekno Love Song' and 'Noah's Ark' I would consider listening to again. If you're thinking of getting this album, please be sure to give it a careful listen before you make any sort of financial commitment. Thank you."
2,this band is much better live!,"Let me start by saying, i respect these girls immensly. Cocorosie are in a class all their own, they are 100% experiemental. But sometimes as a musician, that either pays off or not so much. In this case, not so much. Although some of the songs are pretty, most of it just sounds like a bad acid trip at a circus. Which makes them really fun to see live. Throughout the whole concert i was mezmerised by their theatrics, their voices, and their stage prescence. Will i put their cd in my player and listen to it alone? No, not in less i want the scary clowns to come out and attack me. Yikes."
1,disappointed,"I ordered two chargers. One didn't work at all, and the other one works but you cannot use the phone AT ALL while it's charging. My boyfriend got Cingular's charger, and even though it was $30, it actually works like it is supposed to. You get what you pay for."
1,Do NOT buy,"Do NOT buy this piece of junk. I order two but neither works. First it is very hard to plug it to the cell phone. Then, it charges to ONE bar and doesn't go any further. Also, you cannot make a call while charging. The phone just goes crazy if you try to. Luckily my phone is still fine. I have thrown away both."
5,Una novela inolvidable,"y estremecedora!NO dejes de leerla...Cuando la comienzas, ya no la puedes dejar"
5,Every school girl should have this documentary,"Every school girl needs to watch this, a fascinating documentary, with first class production values. The road from Victoria Woodhull to Hillary's run for President is a rich full history, and it all began with Victoria Woodhull. Every school and college library should have this excellent DVD. I enjoyed it so much, and find myself inspired and in awe that someone so remarkable would have dared to - not just run for US President, but also to become the first woman on Wall Street. She challenged authority and the status quo in a way that makes all women proud. Buy this one for the young girl you love the most, and let it sink in - as her own inspiration as to how much farther she can go in life."
4,Excellent,"This is a long overdue documentary about Victoria Woodhull. The interviews are engaging, serious and captivating. There is much presented in this documentary about Woodhull I had forgotten, such as the infamous BEECHER TILTON TRIAL, it was the trial of the century and Woodhull nearly brought the famous Rev Henry Ward Beecher down. Another issue, is that Victoria Woodhull was arrested under the same law as Margaret Sanger, the Comstock Law for printing obscenities. Imagine if today, someone enforced the same laws! This is a well told story about a gutsy woman who, came from nothing and rose to the New York Society scene, to be the first woman to address the House Judiciary Committee, the first woman on Wall Street and to run for US President - 4 times.America's Victoria, Remembering Victoria Woodhull (Director's Cut~ Two Disc - Collector's Edition)"
5,Great Stuff,This is a great perfume!!! I saw a sample in a magazine and I loved it! It smells fresh and funky and is a great fragrance for any time!
2,Not My Favorite,"I really did not like this scent. It smelled cheap, and as it wore off, I disliked it even more. There's alot of Escada perfumes that I've used throughout the years (and continue to use), however, this one, I do not like..(every person does have different scent preferences though).."
5,A standard reference written by a teenager!,"This is a great classic, still the best reference for historical matters and conceptual questions on special relativity. As for General Relativity it is good but dated. The astonishing thing is that it was written by Wolfgang Pauli when he was nineteen, in 1921, that is 6 years after the publication of the great Einstein paper Foundations of General Relativity. In the fifties a translation into English appeared, together with many comments by the author. The book is a joy to read, if you already had a good introduction to the subject. Otherwise, it is too ""adult"", as Pauli wrote it with his colleagues in mind, not students. I use to consult it when some conceptual problem is the matter. There is, then, no better place. However, as a text, you have now better ones. The mathematical chapters, in particular, became difficult reading, as differential geometry followed different ways from those predicted by the author."
2,everything is NOT relative,"If you enjoy being told that everything is 'relative', and that there are no absolute Truths (except for the speed of light), then this book is for you.But if you believe that there is a difference between right and wrong, up and down, left and right, and you believe that the Sun revolves around the Earth (which it does), you might want to skip this book.Generally speaking, The Theory of Relativity is for people who believe in The Big Bang Theory, Dinosaurs, heliocentricity, and alien civilizations."
1,Dopey,"No real plot: just an endless supply of fiendish humans and subhumans to slash and shoot. The number of Spetznaz troops are endless as is the supply of beer, Marlboros, Mountain Dew, ammunition and aviation fuel: all, apparently readily available in a ravaged post-war America. What kind of warriors would get drunk and fall asleep in indian country? The author knows zip about Las Vegas and Nevada, but does seem knowledgable about West Central Wisconsin. When I lived there it was just Wisconsin.If you like to read at the 8th grade level you may like these books. If not, save your money: I wish I had."
3,I have to read this for u.s. history class,It's not bad actually...and i know i would never pick it up if my teacher haven't assign it to us in class..but i guess the baseball fans should read it..because they would love it...for the people who have no favor in baseball(like me) and are just surfing this for the book review instead of reading it...i guess there's no luck..but hey that's life...:)
4,A Better Writer than Reporter,"Halberstam as always writes beautifully here, but as in some of his other sports books the minor factual errors he makes leave one wondering what else hasn't adequately been checked.For example, the anecdote supposedly occuring in Ralph Terry's rookie season wherein he is alleged to have crossed words with Cy Young. It's a great story, of course. The small problem is that Ralph Terry first appeared in a major league game in August, 1956, while Young died in November, 1955.Could Terry have encountered Young earlier in life, before Terry's rookie season? Of course, but the fact is that it didn't happen as related..."
4,"another great book by this author,","for any baseball fan, but especially one that lived through this era. it examins social and sports issues that effected this country"
5,An Epochal World Series,"A classic matchup: the establishment Yankees vs the underdog Cardinals, who field a younger, more diverse team. The St Louis team makes the Series by the slimmest of margins after overcoming what most thought to be an insurmountable September lead by the Phillies. Then (this was before the postseason playoffs that started in 1969) they were off to the Series to meet the mighty Yankees. The seven game series that resulted was one for the record books. The Cardinals prevailed, but not without a tremendous challenge from the Yanks. The series could just as easily have gone the other way. Halberstam sets up the season for both teams and then provides a wonderful narrative of this nailbiter Series. His minibiographical sketches of key players personalizes the story.This is a book that baseball fans will truly enjoy."
2,Unfulfilled promise,"October 1964 is an interesting, if somewhat rambling series of vignettes about famous baseball players and not-so-famous coaches and scouts. The book is held together only loosely by the fact that it focuses just on Yankees or Cardinals of a general time period. If you are looking for a larger story line or point to any of it, then look to either the editorial reviews or the back flap; the author provides none. The most mystifying piece is that coverage of the actual World Series begins on page 316 of a 360 page book. Even then it is only as the next topic the author stumbles upon, rather than as the culmination of any of the stories which preceeded it. As a baseball fan, I liked some of the insight into the players. I unfortunately also felt that the topic was worth much more."
3,Good but not great,"I gave this three stars cause I did get a lot out of the book Yet not what I expected. As One reviewer here said Why did Mr. Halberstam spend time on Buck O'Neil's history.I will go one further He spent more time on Buck O'Neil as he did the Phillies Collapse That's a big part of the story of October 64That's actually the story I thought I would be reading Cause without it, You don't have the Cardenals in the serise at all.Yet its not all bad Some of the things covered that I did find interesting was the coming of age of Television, And the fall of the Yankees How it happened and what the 60's and College did to the modern Athlete College gave them other choices instead of Baseball so the bonus baby was bornSo there was things to get out of this book but the story of October 1964 You have to wade through 300 pages before he gets to September and the series."
4,A very good book,"Not quite as good as Summer of 1949, but still extremely good. Halberstam does an excellent job of capturing a place and a time. A must read for true baseball fanatics."
4,"Excellent Book, Just too much Mantle","David Halberstam does a magnificent job recounting the year, season, and playoffs of 1964. From the Philles' remarkable collapse to the thrilling 7-game series, he leaves no stone unturned. The only thing that keeps this book from being a five is the overfocus on Mickey Mantle. Too many other great, underappreciated players, like Bobby Richardson and Bill White, are snuffed out because of the Mantle focus. Otherwise, the book is fantastic."
2,Not qood quality,"I agree with the others that had problems with this, I bought it as a gift. I was disappointed that it stopped working so quickly and even when it did the light it put out was minimal. I did not attempt to send it back so I can not comment on replacement... but did not work for me."
2,Grill light,Nice unit but first one failed after one month light just quit working Exchanged for 2nd unit that has worked one season so far without issues time will tell
3,"better than nothing, but no spotlight here","for what it is (a small battery powered portable light), it does the trick. more light would be beneficial for grilling in the dark, but a decent product."
1,Can't withstand weather,I purchased this for husband and cannot tolerate rain at all. Stopped working within week.
4,Great portable grill light,"I have only done trial runs on the light, but I'm very pleased that it can be removed and stored so easily. This precludes the moisture issue I've experienced with previous grill lights which lasted only a few months. The illumination could be a little brighter, but it does the trick!DougAcworth, GA"
1,CRAP!,very dim! Light bulbs went out after a few weeks. I couldn't figure out how/if i can change the 2 little bulbs.
1,Would not buy,"While it was in working order it gave a good light for grilling, but it stopped working about the third or fourth time it was used."
5,Love it,"I bought this for my husband. We use it all the time. Once he's finished grilling, we clip it to our umbrella for an overhead light."
4,"24"" Tool Box Waterloo","This tool box is well made, however, if you plan to carry it around, I think the model with the hand grabs on the ends would be better. I plan to keep mine stationary, as it is for recreational vehicle use only."
1,tell us something we dont know,I hope that this book is free because I;ve seen pamphlets at the DMV that where more informative. please reduce the cover price.
4,admirable,"The best way to descibe this collection is refreshing. This collection surprises the reader by keeping us off balance with humor, anger, sadness, sympathy. We look forward to turn the pages to find more."
3,Take your pick of any of these,"Seems that all of these help with CDs are almost the same. I do use the Sleep one each night, but have not found that this one helps me more."
2,Outdated but useful in some ways,"This book is not even in print anymore. There are three expansion packs out now. This book only covers the first one (Rise of the Zilart) and does not cover Chains of Promathia or Treasures of Aht Urghan at all. It is useful to newbs who are trying to find their way around the game, but there is nothing in this book that cannot be found on the internet if you just search for it. There are numerous sites that contain much more useful information (Such as allakhazam) but the problem with them is that the way this game is written, you cannot Alt-tab out of it to view another web page. Once you are in the game, you have to exit it to access any other programs on your pc (I play pc version exclusively....this doesn't apply to PS2 or X-Box players)."
2,Should Have Shipped With The Game. . .,"This guide is nothing more than a decent instruction manual for FFXI. The idea was good and if you started playing the game, let's say, back when it was first released in Japan, this so-called guide may have been helpful. But times change and so do MMORPG's. Don't get this guide unless you have a time machine so you can go back to when it would have been useful."
2,"Fee is a rip off, bad game",This game would actually be good if it didnt have the $13 dollar fee per month. I have like 15 online game whcich have NO fee whatsoever. After like 10 months they get 130 bucks! Why not just price the game at 200 dollar because thats how much its going to cost you eventually. This is the biggest rip off in the long run i've really ever seen! Oh yeah by the way you can only play the game online so no matter what you have to pay.
3,For the Newbies _ONLY_,"This is a great book for those JUST STARTING OUT on FFXI, much of the information from Fall of '03 still works with the current incarnation of FFXI, however, due to the ever-changing nature of FFXI, it will be out of date sometime next year. The job guidelines are great, and it's really geared to the new player. A good buy for any wanting to know a bit more about the game, but don't expect everything in here. There's a level 50 Cutoff on spells, equipment, and information in general (the game currently goes up to level 75) My copy has gotten much use, and I still break it out once in a while. ^_^"
1,worst guide EVER,"First of all, i would like to add that this guide is a complete rip-off. It only covers up to level 50, and wen it was released, half of the quests listed were incorrect. DO NOT BUY THIS. No use spending so much money on a guid that covers half the levels, no expansion areas, no enemy drops or pictures, and certainly didnt cover ANYTHING after lvl 50, including monsters. It is the worst guide I have ever seen"
3,"Good, for an instruction manual...","FFXI is my first MMORPG that I've really gotten into, so I'm still learning the ins and outs that most MMORPG gamers take for granted as ""Common Knowledge"". I picked up this book to help me, and specifically, for maps and lists of items/spells/monsters etc... Unfortunately, I find the instruction manual that SHOULD have come with the game itself. Don't get me wrong, the info I wanted is in here but sadly, the maps are exactly the same ones as the in game maps, with no added information to help you out. The book gave me some really good tips and hints, but its mainly a beginners guide, don't expect it to go far into telling you how to do quests or items worth's etc...Its a good book for a beginner, but if you're not a beginner like me, its really a useless book for you, its disappointing, most of the stuff in this guide really should have been part of the manual that came with the game."
1,Frustrating,"I wouldn't mind the bad sound quality, but the connection of the jack is very flaky. If you plug it in and have sound you better hope that you don't move it or any vibration causes it not too work anymore. I've spent more time than I should have adjusting the thing to make it work. Don't buy it."
1,I never got the part - so I don't know if it's any good,"This may be a wonderful part, but a massive snafu caused Electrogalaxy to ship something else useless. I had to hassle with a return, pack it up and I am waiting for any response from ElectroGalaxy. Of course, the bargain I jumped at is no longer available"
2,Not the best quality,These are spode but they aren't the same quality as my other spode dishes. They look like seconds. The bottom of the bowls have pit marks on them. I will buy in person from now on.
5,why you may love this book,"the actual result of the rare upbringing of the 3 children of the Schaper and Goldstein marriage of a Protestant woman minister and her non -practicing Jewish husband, who helped their children learn via Protestant Sunday School and church attendance and preparation for Communion, plus full preparation for Bat and Bar Mitzvahs, was that all 3 chose to practice Judaism as their primary faith as adults. Their dad became a practicing Jew in the process, and ended up as biographer of a well known minister, Wm. Sloane Coffin, in a book published this year by Yale U. Press.The US statistics on children of Jewish- Christian families seem to support this result, since more of them produce Jewish children, and an equal number to those in fully Jewish families."
3,"Not bad, easy read, a little shallow, business oriented","Useless for hard-core developers, but ok for business and IT people wanting to consider new ways of doing business. The case studies will likely help people think up new business ideas. Written as if it was a collection of journalist articles in infoweek or similar. I read (skimmed) it in under an hour."
2,Spongebob,"This is not worth the money! Spongebob is so top heavy that he doesn't stand up on his own! I don't see anyone else that listed this as a problem, maybe its just us! haha"
2,Glad it was a birthday gift,I am glad that this was a birthday gift and not something I had to spend my own money on. SpongeBob collects alot of dirt quickly and the pieces do NOT stay in very well. As far as the obscene gesture...I can understand why some people may be turned off by it. My 2 year old who LOVES SpongeBob pays no attention to it.
4,"Bill Evans in Tokyo, I recommend!","This cd is good. I like ""My Romance"", T.T.T.T. (Twelve Tone Tune Two) and ""Hullo Bolinas"" best. The drummer and bass solos are good but after listening to this cd several times I only wish Evans had more time soloing than the others because he is very good. Bill Evans Tune T.T.T.T. is very groovy. I haven't heard many jazz tunes composed in this twelve tone manner but this one sends chills down the spine. ""Hullo Bolinas"" is a relaxing tune I have listened to hundreds of times and and the solos on My Romance are great. The other songs are good but those mentioned stand out."
1,Useless,"Boston Terrier mix won't even touch this toy even though I put her favortie treats in it. The first time I gave it to her, she rolled it around for a few minutes and nothing came out. In order for treats or kibble to come out, it really needs to bounce around not roll. Other busy buddy products are much better."
2,Very Ambiguous,"Even though Adams is a brilliant thinker his writing lacks lucidity. His book promises too much, and delivers too little. I know he has an argument, but his writing style lacks deduction and his ideas need further development. It is almost easier to read Hegel's mind than to decipher the connection between Adam's premises. If you are not totally familiar with the works of Darwin and Freud be ware; Adams should not be your starting point."
2,another broadway voice,"Nice to hear the songs revived but in my opinion this artist sounds like another Broadway voice - but not Merman. Very nice voice but without Merm's salty Brooklyn tones, her humour and trumpet-like purity of projection. Just a note: if you're going to imitate Merman, the word 'ever' is pronounced 'evaaaaah'!"
1,PALE IMITATION,I was very disappointed by this recording. It in no way does justice to a unique and very special performer. Save your money and find the real thing.
5,A Treasure,"Glenn C. has produced an absolute treasure of a book here; first-class, solid, profound, down-to-earth, completely accessible and thoroughly engaging in it's presentation. Whether you are new to the 12 Step program or a someone with many 24-hours of experience, you will find an abundance of fresh ideas, valuable anecdotes, useful insights, and the unique time-tested wisdom which has grown out of 60+ years of AA experience. Thanks Glenn for this new classic--here's one that Bill and Bob (AA's founders) would heartily recommend."
4,remarkable detail on a rare subject,"I was impressed with the amount of detail on William Rufus by Frank Barlow. He pieced together a time in English history that seems to be looked over by most historians. Barlow makes a strong analytical approach to dispelling public perception of William Rufus. He makes sure you understand that the remaining documentaton on William Rufus is so fragmented. And that that does remain is from one point of view, the Church which obvouisly does not favor William Rufus. Barlow points out William II was a more capable ruler than most give him credit for and this angle is enough to make this book a must read for those interested in Norman History and the English crown."
5,Monk is sublime,"Monk recorded several indispensable albums, and this is one of them. Each cut is beautifully and thrillingly performed by a tight, smart band. This is one of several classics by Monk."
4,Excellent Addition,"This ablum is an excellent addition to any collection, Monk at The Five Spot sees heavy rotation in my collection. Check out the first track, Nutty."
2,Mediocre,There are plenty of recordings Monk did before he discovered Charlie Rouse who became his partner for many years. This LP feature Johnny Griffin. It's mediocre and disappointing if you know how good it could be compared with other live recordings.
5,Huzzah to Monk & Griffin!,"This one is a humdinger! Unlike Monk's work with later accompaniest Charlie Rouse (who, although a superb musician, at times seems willing to bend over backwards to keep from stepping on Monk's musical toes), this stuff has an incredible asset in the way of sax man Griffin, who stretches out further and gets a bit wilder. Probably my desert island Monk recording. No need to say more, I suppose."
5,Monk at his best!,"This is a must-have in any serious Jazz collection. Everybody (Johnny Griffen, Ahmed Abdul Malik & Roy Haynes) are in topform here!The live format makes for a loose, exciting set, with some of the greatest Monk originals, and with lots of space to stretch. The guy who gave this a bad review must be crazy!I clearly prefer these sets to the later stuff with Charlie Rouse!"
3,weak wrapping,"This book arrived with one corner broken given that it olny had a thin layer of plastic bubbles, without any box, for such a long journey."
5,Wonderful images - especially by Edward Weston of Charis,"A beautifully presented book with some very powerful images. Highly recommended to those who rate Edward Weston as one of the greatest ""artists"" of the 20th century."
2,I am disappointed,"forget it! What a disappointment! If you're looking for beautiful nudes, chose other books. Beside the Weston pictures there are quite no nudes."
2,The Model Wife - an outmoded concept,"""The Model Wife"" strikes this reviewer as a publication to avoid. The title itself has two major implications, neither of them positive. One suggests wife as passive object for the husband/creator's pleasure. The second, that there is such a thing as a perfect wife, defined of course by male expectations.Ollman in fact admits that ""the power over the images...rests with the husbands and explicitly not with their wives."" He claims he cannot find similar work by women taken of their spouses. They are out there, of course, in talent and in abundance, but he cannot ""see"" them and does not give them credence.Other biases in the book are objectionable as well. Do we really need to know which artists are Jewish or half-Jewish? Are Baptists so designated? Paternity is called ""siring"" - are we talking here of horses or humans?Given these inherent stumbling blocks, it is difficult to see this book as anything more than a male hierarchy extending its grip on history."
3,If you are into the experiments this is an informative book...,I found some of this book to be informative and not much different than many of the other books I've read on the subject. It is filled with lots of experiments on the subject.
3,Telepathy not subliminal psychology,"Just to clarify. I bought this book, thinking it was about subliminal psychology and communication. That is not so. This book is about suggestion through telepathy and such parapsychological phenomena.The 3 stars is because I wouldn't be able to rate it fairly."
4,Excellent intro to Unitarian Universalism,"A thin, simple book that is an excellent introduction to the basics of Unitarian Universalism. Don't look for deep history of theological discussions, but rather a list of questions with answers about the basics of this unique ""church""."
3,Not the Best Intro,"This is a short, but flawed introduction to Unitarian Universalism. There are some factual inaccuracies (the Universalist P.T. Barnum was not a founder of Tufts), and also a bit of a bias toward the humanist wing of modern UUism.Try the Unitarian Universalist Pocket Guide or another introduction to Unitarian Universalism instead of or at least in addition to this book."
4,"Quick, Easy, Informative Introduction to Unitarian Universalism","****This is a short, quick booklet (45 pages) introduction to Unitarian Universalism that can be easily be read in under an hour by most anyone. I am new to the UU Church and found it immensely helpful. It covers general beliefs, values, history, ceremony, and especially how UU differs from the Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish religions--plus more--100 FAQs in all. The author makes the point that this is not an official book, but the opinions of a pastor and the author. For me, it was a great starting off point, with more than I could find online and in a much more agreeable format.Recommended.****"
5,Excellent cat food,"Like another reviewer said, this cat food literally saved our pet's life. He couldn't keep any type of food down but was always starving. He would gobble down whole cans of food and then immediately throw it back up. The vet's only recommendation was to keep switching to different brands of food -- at no time did he tell us to avoid the filler that most manufacturers add to their food. After a little searching on the internet, I saw that perhaps it was the additional ingredients which may be the cause of his upset stomach. By Nature was the only brand at PetSmart that had such a high content of natural ingredients, both in the dry and canned food; it doesn't contain corn, wheat or soy. He's been eating By Nature for 2 weeks now, is looking much better and has gained back some of his weight. Yes, it's more expensive than the other brands but it's well worth it for a happy, healthy cat."
3,So so,"It smells fine and I like that it's organic, but the cat just isn't as wild about this one as she is about other brands."
3,Nature Organics 6 oz cans Turkey/Chicken,"Overall, the ordering process and timing was good. The cost is much higher than most main stream cat foods but Nature Organics ingredient listing is much superior to others. My cats didn't dig this Turkey/Chicken so much by itself but when mixed with dry food was gobbled up more enthusiastically."
5,The weapon is an extension of the body.,"While nominally a book on bladed weapons, much information in this book is on motion per-se and its effective application in combat, with or without a bladed weapon. This is only natural, because the old saying that the weapon is an extension of the body is cliche but true. Hence many of the principles set forth in this book may be put to use whether you are empty handed or holding a weapon, and may well give you an advantage if ever forced to face a weapon attack."
1,Stinks,I don't like this movie at all! The Kid thinks he is all that which he isn't. This was one of the WORST disney channel movies ever!
5,GENIUS,"When it comes to science theres no problem Charlie Hoyle can't solve.But there are some other things in life even a Genius can't do,and for that Charlie is about to discover a whole new side to himself."
3,Too sticky for me!,"The flavor of these orange slices is great, but the candy is too sticky and has too much sugar dusted on it. Like the lemon & lime better."
2,Love Travolta's singing back in the Day,"Wasn't as good as I had hoped, had an old LP and it was grainy sounding that's why I wanted the CD."
2,What?,"This CD doesn't contain any of John Travolta's songs fromGrease. It features songs from the two albums he recorded during his ""teen idol"" days onWelcome Back, Kotter. The songs are '70s pop shlock. Most of the songs are pretty terrible, but there are a few decent moments. There were actually three hit songs from the two albums. The best one is ""All Strung Out"", which is a definite guilty pleasure for me. I can't recommend this CD, but if you are a big John Travolta fan you may want to check it out."
3,Interesting Dialogue,"Not the best of John Waters films... The dialogueis certainly worthy, and probably a script therapy,for the ""Master of Bizarre"" John Waters... Sort ofslow moving, but still a fun romp!"
1,Not funny says it all.,"I've enjoyed Water's movies for some twenty plus years and some of his earliest still sting to this day however his better movies all had one thing in common and that they were funny. A Dirty Shame has some clever ideas and made watch-able thanks to the brilliant Tracy Ulman but its qualities end there. The timing is off, the acting is not hammy or amateur enough for the campy dialogue the results are a flat dull movie that looks for humor in characters that consider themselves addicts. Sex addicts, drug addicts are either that funny. Water's has always had a way of lifting the low-life to a heroic status here they are just boasting outcast wallowing in their addictions."
1,Snooze and snore,"My son, his girlfriend and I rented this simply because it had Tracy Ullman and Chris Isaak in it. We expected this to be riotous, knowing Tracy Ullman's humor. We got into the movie about 30 minutes, that we remember, and the next thing we knew, we were waking up! What a snooze-fest! A Dirty Shame was the stupidest, most boring, not-funny, movie I'd seen in a long time. It's not shocking, doesn't really make a social commentary on sex or prudes other than what you can expect (older people don't want to see it and hear about it in public vs. younger people want to do it anywhere they can). Wanted to ask Blockbuster for our money back. Yyyeeesh! What were they thinking?"
2,Weak even for Waters,"I love a lot of John Waters' movies, but this was a major disappointment. A lot of this is over the top, but it doesn't really work like ""over the top"" did in his earlier films. It has one hilarious scene, and the rest is just sub-par material. It mostly comes off as corny, even when you ""get"" the John Waters style of overacting."
4,More Fun with John Waters,"Like many John Waters fans, I enjoy his 1970s movies the most. But this one is a lot of fun, and not to be missed. Some say that the last part is overdone, but that's one of his trademarks. Others say that his brand of humor is 30 years out-of-date, but if you like it anyway then see this one."
1,DESTROY ALL NEUTERS,"Pure disappoointment. I do not know how John Waters has allowed this ""Neuter Version"" to be made available to the viewing public.This is a ""Clean Version"", almost to the point of many scenes being completely overdubbed with ""Neuter"" dialogue, and some scenes even deleted. This defeats the purpose of John Waters movies. If you don't like crude and obscene, DON'T watch a John Waters movie. This is a joke, and is nothing compared to the brilliant uncut theatrical version. Avoid this ""Neuter Version"" at ALL costs."
3,An Encyclopedia of Twisted Erotic Dysfunctions,"John Waters's films have always been excessive, over-the-top and juvenile. That's most of the fun. However, ""A Dirty Shame"" suffers from satirical excess and an unrelenting pace that seems forced and overdone. It's laborious instead of fun. The dialogue and script reads like a bemusing encyclopedia of twisted erotic dysfunctions. Tracey Ullman was a good choice, but she's so manic, I wondered if she has a `meth' problem. There were a few moments of inspiration, like the `bears' orgies and the guy who craps in the wrong part of the toilet, but they were few. I suspect this was just a quick mistake for John Waters. The featurette is almost more amusing than the film! I still look forward to his next movie!"
1,BEWARE!!!! BAD VERSIONS of DVD SOLD to CUSTOMERS!!!!!!!,"Ok...So I purchased this DVD( USED )from a seller on Amazon. When I played the movie I noticed the Director's voice commentary through out as the movie played. Immediately I stopped the movie and checked every last setting icon on the DVD menu. So after 20mins of frustration without any luck of removing the Director's Commentary...I then realized this unfortunately is how the DVD was manufactured. After much disappointment, I'm left wondering ""Why would the Seller think a customer would want to purchase a movie with an annoying voice speaking through the entire movie?"" So unfortunately I can't return the DVD. I would now just like to purchase a NEW copy from Amazon, but I'm scared of ending up with the same BAD VERSION. Can anyone help me in choosing the right copy? I still want the NC-17 version just without the Directors's Commentary."
3,Not Nearly as Shocking or Funny as the Film thinks it is,"Waters seems to have crawled out of a thirty plus year fall out shelter. Hello! Nothing is shocking anymore. Sexual libertine types such as Waters won the cultural war. Someone answering the door naked? That's the best he could come up with? Wake up, in a Britney Spear world, the ""neuters"" are the new rebels.Waters never quite mastered satire and his films only worked as camp. Clearly this embarrassment shows he has outlived his useful life as a film maker. At least admit you are mainstream horn dogs now, Waters types, or rebel for the sake of rebeling and join the neuters, or just get a life and stop trying to P.O. the bourgeoisie."
3,Recommended for diehard fans only,"It's not one of John Water's best films, but if you are a serious fan of his work like me, then go ahead and see it for the sake of comparison. As for the NC-17 rating, it's fairly tame. There is one scene with a penis, but the special effects make it unrealistic.I believe this best works are Polyester, Desperate Living, and Female Trouble. I wasn't terribly fond of Hairspray and Cry Baby, but I'm not a huge lover of musicals."
1,ugh,"I didn't realize when i ordered this that it was the ""neuter"" version, which means they basically took all the great stuff out, I would deff recommend paying a few extra dollars for the unrated version, this is just SAD."
3,Tracy Ullman Filmography,"I just bought it to update my Tracy Ullman library, she having been a personal favorate comedienne for some time.."
3,lol,"This movie would have gotten a higher rating from me if Johnny Knoxville wasn't in it. I simply have no respect for him after the Jacka** movie and TV show that he created. This story is funny and over the top, you're not supposed to take it seriously (just look at Ursula Udder's chest!) The storyline is a little weird, and if the storyline had been a bit more coherent, this would have been a better movie, like Orgazmo."
1,Ripoff,"I watched this movie all the way through only because I paid $22.00 plus shipping and felt I should give it every chance to redeem itself. It is a stinker and if there were minus number ratings I would give it -10!! Rated ""R"" for what? Language? Adult content? I have seen Disney films more deserving of the ""R"" rating. This movie was silly, definitely not entertaining in any way and I threw it in the same bucket I put my dog's crap in when I clean up the yard. I am a Chris Isaak fan, have all his CDs and went to his concert on December 9. The fact that he would associate himself with this garbage has changed my view of him and unfortunately, even his music. I did not find the film offensive, I enjoy hard core porn. I feel this is a rip off, poorly done in all aspects and highly do not recommend it to anyone!!!"
1,Absolutely Putrid!,"This was without question, the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. Tracey Ullman should be shot for even appearing in it. The only reason I gave it one star is because there was no lower rating. And Patricia Hearst as a sexaholic! Give me a break. This film reached lows I did not dream imaginable. Do not waste your time with it. The plot was absurd, the acting deplorable and the directing was positively dreadful. A total waste of time."
4,Waters Back on/off Track!,"So good to see that John Waters has got his edge back! Been missing it ever since Cecil B. Demented! Saw the NC-17 version and then watched it again, and again, and again. One should also view it while listening to Waters's commentary track. Three cheers for the whole cast and crew. By the way, where I come from we call them ""Rosebuds"" NOT ""blossoms!"""
4,Lets go SEXTING!!,"Amazing movie from the mad mad mind of one of Baltimores finest directors. Tracy Ullman, Selma Blair and Johnny Knoxville what else can you say? Yes its crude, yes its crase, but believe if you dont bust out laughing atleast at a couple of the movies one liners your a prude. Other than that loved the movie I dont want to give too much away so I will just say Selma's ultra fake boobies are just the tip of the ice berg here. Trust me youll see!"
1,Idiotic,"My extremely low opinion of John Waters work, and particularly the later, higher budget stuff, has absolutely nothing to do with his subject matter. It has everything to do with his inability to write a script and to direct a movie with any coherence whatsover. The only funny moments in this film, or any of his other films, is when an actor of Tracy Ulman's abilities brings something inspired to his tired collections of idiotic potty jokes and strained attempts at outrageous sexual humor. These moments make up about 1 percent of his films, if that. Awful. I guess he keeps getting money to make this garbage becasue people keep buying it, and all power to him for that."
1,PLEASE MAKE IT END!!!,"There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is ""touched"" by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle... Need I say more?The plot, the ""humor,"" the dialogues, and the music are way beyond ""below average.""There is next to no nudity and there are no, I mean 0 as in ZERO beautiful girls, in this film!As for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors! It is truly sad...Rent or buy (ha ha ha) at your own risk. You have been warned!"
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I'm a big John water's fan and loved ""A Dirty Shame"" when I saw it in the theatre, but what they've done to this version with the ""R Rating"" is not only a dirty shame but it's criminal.I bought it sight unseen because of the ""R Rating"" as opposed to the ""NC-17 theatrical release"" with the hopes of more. It has been edited mercilessly. ALL profanity had been dubbed over, they completely cut out the highlight of the ""Hokey Pokey"" scene (Those of you who have seen the theatrical release know what I'm talking about), and they even pixelated the hand of a character flipping the bird.I can't believe John Waters would let one of his films be butchered to such an extent. There are no bonus features (except trailers) and all the best stuff has been cut out. Shame on New Line for their horribly misleading marketing.Don't be conned like I was, it is a dirty shame."
1,Can't always get what you want,"I expected the NC-17 version and got a softer side of R- rated. I'll know better next time. Since I only spent 5 dollars, it could have been worse."
3,"Not as funny as it could be, but I learned a few things","Some parts were funny /More parts were stupid, but still /educational"
2,A Dirty Shame of a movie,"This is a really, really dumb movie. You have to be really depraved and sex starved to enjoy this one. Ranks up there short of Dumb and Dumber."
3,spank me-I am so shameful,"short and to the point. I loved the movie. if you love, like or hate JOHN WATERS -then you know exactly what you will be seeing. no needs for ANALyzing this movie. if you are looking for something just AWEEBIT different. then give it a try."
4,"Starts strong, but the jokes are recycled.",I drove over an hour and a half to see this movie in the theater and while it started out HILARIOUS (the hokey pokey is the BEST) it kind of lost its charm towards the end. I absolutely love John Waters' movies but the jokes are recycled and we all know how dirty jokes become stale oh so quickly. BUT I will buy this DVD only because Selma Blair and Tracy Ulman are absolutely brilliant in this film. Plus it's always good to see Patty Hearst in ANYTHING.
1,Don't buy collagen!,"The collagen casings were thick and broke both on the grill and in the pan. They had to be tied in a knot to close in between sausages instead of simply twisting. It is worth the extra $$ for real casings. And I would argue with the word ""edible"" in the name - I did not find them to be edible at all, and ended up peeling all my sausages to eat them."
4,Love them tasty sausages!,"I purchased the 21 mm Edible Collagen Casings to use with my brand new sausage maker. Although this was my first attempt at sausage, the resulting product was quite tasty. The casings held up well to my inexpert handling, and they had no discernible taste once cooked. The entire process wasn't as difficult as I feared, though it was extremely messy.A couple of points to consider when making sausage using this product:1. 21 mm is about the size of a standard breakfast link. You'll need larger casings if you're looking to make larger sausages like hot dogs, brats, and so forth.2. You might consider using cooking string to tie off individual links. The instructions I followed said that you could just twirl the casings to make links, but that didn't work out so good -- the links tended to unravel, creating one huge sausage. I'm sure there's a trick to it, but until you learn it, the string works just fine.Overall, a good product that I'd be happy to use again"
4,Rankin at his best,"This is the best Rankin book - and one of the best humour books around. He combines his excellent jokes with a short piece at the beginning of the book that is one of the funniest things ever written - yes, you heard it. The overall standard of the book is high, however the plot is not too far above his average (if humourous) standards. Especially worthwhile for Rankin veterans, as large parts of the Sprout mythology are revealed X-Files style at the end of the book."
4,Not as good as I was expecting it to be,"Given that this had been strongly recommended by Fr James Schall, whose recommendations I respect, I came to this book with high expectations, which were not quite met. That being said, there are some valuable thoughts on the development of Greek religion and the interrelatedness of human virtue and supernatural virtue. He is excellent on the absolute transcendence of God and on the place of the sacraments in the christian life."
2,really big Dummy,"I did not realized that it actually quite big. I bought it for my closet, but it showed up too big, so I could not use it. It's for doors."
1,Slow credit for returns,"Eveything went fine until I tried to get credit for a return. The hair dryer was defective. You have to call and get a code to make a return. That all went well and UPS picked it up at my house. However, it was a month after the return that I finally got credited back. I called and e-mailed with no repsonse and it was not until I placed a dispute with the credit card company that I got results. A bad way to do business!"
2,"If it is so great and sold for a year, why only one review?","According to the only review, the Sol Ray Blow Dryer is rated at 4 stars and writes that he and friends have used it for a year. If it is so great why only a single review?It was recently featured on Fresh Gear so I would expect more reviews in the next month. Perhaps potential buyers should be cautious and wait for another review before paying $90 for a hair dryer."
1,Garbage,This is NOT a Grand National Replica. It is a Corvette chassis with a screwed up Regal body. Avoid them all if you are a GN fan.
5,Another classic!,"If your child likes to draw, you can't beat Ed Emberley for his fun, creative, and best of all EASY drawing instructions. He provides simple, step-by-step pictorial guidelines which even young children can follow: if they can recognize and reproduce basic shapes, then they can draw the faces in this book. For each step of a particular drawing, there is a basic instruction such as ""make a green triangle"" or ""add two squiggly lines."" These instructions are accompanied by two sketches: a drawing of whatever it is to be added and a drawing of the face-in-progress as a whole, so children can easily see how the parts fit together. Not only does this book provide a fun play activity, but also it's great for helping school-aged kids to enhance book reports and other school projects. Even adults will appreciate both the ease at which this book helps them to produce a wide variety of silly faces and the author's humorous style. A great gift for pre-school and elementary school aged children."
5,One of my favorites...,I love this book and Ed Emberley! He makes the pictures so easy to draw and my children both at home and at school LOVE to follow along with me and draw these cute pictures.
3,Huge!,This thing is HUGE and swallowed my HTC Aria. Not like the regular Otterbox for the iPhone if that's what you're looking for. Had to return the product.
5,Weird Menace,"Not memorable? Maybe if you're in the final stages of altzheimer's! Ronald Stein is a genius at creating and sustaining a mood of weird suspense. Even when the movie was a mess, like The Terror or most of Dementia 13, Stein's scores create a very wonderful and melodic sense of menace. The stuff from Spider Baby is why I got this disc, and it's great. Stein's music conjures the film's black humor perfectly. But I was very pleasantly shocked at how good the whole damn disc is!"
4,"A very important book, though not a great read.",I found the explanations of the standard modern physics subjects to be mediocre except the part about Bell's Theorem. The significance lies not in the treatment of the subject (Bell's Theorem) but in the fact that Peat has tackled the subject at all. This theorem may prove to be the most important discovery in human history. Experimental proof (I've heard tell that it has been proven.) of local indeterminacy is mind-boggling. Why every science writer worth his salt isn't jumping to come up with a better write up is beyond me. This book is a must read--even for real students of quantum mechanics.
3,The Early Celine............. more like 3.5 stars,This is some of Celine's early recordings. I do not speak French but she certainly sounds different. I've listened to this cd once and it sounds pretty good...and a great start of what was to come for Celine...
5,K.O.A.,"I used to have the ""Hyena"" album and have been looking for it on CD for a year now. I was overjoyed when I saw that it was included with a DVD of Johanna's performance pieces. I have never seen any performance art to speak of, so I totally loved the energy and creativity of Mz. Went's pieces--it's like Kabuki on Acid. ""Mound Builder"" is one of my favorite songs so I was also happy to see that the CD had more of her songs--now I also like ""The Worm"". If anyone has never seen performance art before...enter with an open mind and enjoy! I'm sure even Salvador Dali would have enjoyed it."
5,Jai Hanuman !!,Fantastic versions of Chalisa. Beautiful vocals and arrangements. Incredibly heart moving. Incredible to listen to the speed and and perfect diction of many of the versions. Would highly recommend
2,So much useless stuff,"Many very useful taps and dies are not included and many useless are in two (bottoming and taper). The price is 35% lower than that if you buy every piece separately. Take into account that you don't need half of this set, and you realize that you you wasted money."
4,Fun toy for the price I paid,"I bought this for my 4 1/2 year old son--he had a great time playing with it but the ramp pieces were always falling off. I wouldn't recommend this as an ""everyday"" play item..I put it in the toy closet and bring it out about once a week and it keeps him occupied for an hour or so. My 3 year old loves these toys too! I got this item on sale so I am not sure I would pay full price for it."
4,pop-up playset,"This toy is great because it is so portable. We like to keep it in the baby's diaper bag so we will have it for our 4 yr old when we are at a restaurant or in someplace where we need him to sit and wait quietly. Since he doesn't get to play with it except at those times, it serves its purpose well. We just bought a couple of other pop up playsets for an upcoming trip involving air travel. Our 4 yr old loves these."
3,Masher is not for me.,"This potato masher is OK. It is great in that it does not scratch your cookware, and it does get all the potatoes by the side of the pot, but it just seems a little awkward when using, and therefore makes the process go a little slow. Perhaps I will get used to it since I am still using it, as it does do a good job, but the grip is just not right for me."
5,Awesome masher,"I love the angle to this masher. I mostly use it for fruit for jams and such, but I really like how it mashes and fits against the side of the bowl."
4,"Well written, but dated","It's a great book and well written for a ""sys admin brain"" with lots of great Cisco command examples, but the material is quite dated. I'd love to see an updated copy released."
2,Not what I was hoping for...,I was expecting a detailed exposition on the culture of Vodun/Obeah-it's origins with respect for the cosmology of Afrikan peoples;this it was not.
1,Boorrrinnng,"The title and blurb on the cover are very misleading. Some archaeologist. Want to know how he ""finds"" the Layla guitar? He opens an auction catalog and Paul Allen's checkbook (billionaire MS co-founder). I thought it might be a fun read, but is just full of the author's strange obsession with bands from the Pacific Northwest you have never heard of on labels you never heard of (like things from the 30s). Maybe two people on Earth cares, and he admits it."
4,Just what I wanted,"In preparation for a long recovery, I ordered several Italian cookbooks. Rocco's book was just the ticket! While others have a better ""voice"" of the cook, this one actually has recipes that I will try. It contains recipes that most closely resemble my mother in law's cooking which I have been trying to replicate since we lost her to cancer in the mid 80's. Often I'd remember just part of the recipe or some of the ingredients and not be able to make it. This book contains so many of them that maybe now I'll be able to give it a try. It is just what I was looking for. Thanks."
1,really boring,"i understand that this movie was made in 1986, but the graphics were really cheesy, and it was very slow moving and very boring.all this video did was show clips of horror movies, and tied some stories into it.the host John Carridine was really annoying, if you like ghost storiessave your money and go with unsolved mysteries or anything else.Don't Waste your money."
3,I sang Backround Vocals on this CD,"Was called in at the last minute to Record the Backround vocals on this CD back in 1995 in Studio City, CA. Fell in Love with Michelle and her voice...may she R.I.P."
1,"""Annoying""","""Toonful Too"" is a very cheesy cd.The girl singer's voice is also very annoying.Whoever produced this cd was either misguided, in denial, or a total theater queen.I would not recommend this cd."
2,Charges okay but you need a rubber band!,"C'mon folks,you need to think about the design. Okay so this charger charges just fine. It works which is better than the last one I bought and appears fairly rugged. It plugs directly into a wall socket which has the advantage of minimizing wired connections that can tear or shred over time. THAT SAID, when you plug it into the wall the battery falls out of the cradle! The mannufacture made no provision for the fact that once it is in the wall the unit with battery is now VERTICAL. Unless you have a electrical outlet coming our of your floor, the only way you can use this charger is by putting a rubber band around the whole contraption. This what I did, it works, but you got to be kidding me."
4,Loved!,"This is the perfect book for physical science lovers! National Geographic always has stunning photography but this is mind blowing! The information given was directly matched with each photograph which made the pictures speak more. The author describes how each phenomenon (volcanoes, earthquakes and tornadoes) develop. Grace also shows warning signs of each and explains how to get to safety. There are also interesting facts almost every page. I definitely recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't have interest in physical science. It's an attention grabber no matter what age the person!"
1,trash,"This is trash. It looks fancy, like you are getting a bunch of features, but the sweeping action only works for a few days.The worst thing, is that there are small areas where the powerhead sucks in water besides the intake port.This means that small particles will be sucked into the device, causing many problems. Also, senstivie organisms like anemones and sea hares will be MUTILATED even if you do your best to screen off the intake.Do not buy it. This thing is trash."
5,A help in a time of need,Amoryn coupled with Seredyn is a safe and easy way to take the edge of during stressful situations. I have used it many times when feeling a bit under and it works for me. I have purchased this combo about 4 times over the last couple of years.
5,amoryn supplement,this product works great for depression with no side effects. taken twice a day makes you happy to be alive
1,Doesn't work,"This was a waste of time and I tried to return it for a credit, but company refused to give me a credit."
1,Worst service,"First, I have not received my product! They sent me the wrong order . They called me asked me to send it back and then they would send me my original order. I sent it back over a month ago. I still have not received my order. I would not suggest buying anythin g from Head to Toe."
2,Only for healthy people.,I have high blood pressure and had to discontinue using Amoryn and any product containing SJW. SJW causes blood pressure to increase in some individuals. Use this product only if you are completely healthy without high blood pressure.
5,amoryn,I got this for my daughter she was having a stressful time and this helped her through it and she handled the stress much better.
5,My favorite score... by far,"I recently bought this album, and i have to say it's fantastic. the music is extremely melancholic and sad, especially the ""love theme"" which runs throughout many of the tracks. listen to the sample of track #1. if its as amazing to you as it is to me, grab the album."
5,One of the Great Minimalist Scores,"The music for Chinatown could have been forgettable. Goldsmith could have chosen to write music that was typical 30s in style and could have done it very effectively. However, he chose to write a score that becomes part of the visuals of the film. The music becomes pure emotion and sound effects of the thoughts in the minds of the characters. The only unfortunate thing about this CD is that it duplicates the original soundtrack on Dot Records from 1974 and we deserve ALL the cues from the soundtrack. Here we only get certain takes. That said, this is still haunting, magical, etheric and utterly appropriate for the film. The Main title is absolutely gorgeous and worth the price of the CD alone."
5,Atmospheric Bliss,"Chinatown has to be one of my favorite movies. The acting, direction, pacing, and feel of the entire movie is pitch-perfect. The soundtrack is one of the greatest in movie history; it is such an essential part of the movie!The intro sets the entire mood. The sound of the trumpet always gives me goosebumps. It's that good!In response to earlier reviews that ""it was too short"", this is exactly the amount of music that has always been in the movie. The soundtrack really does only run for over a half-an-hour. If the songs don't ""fully develop,"" it's because they never were meant to. The tracks cannot be judged individually; they form an artistic and emotional masterpiece that must be taken as a whole.Truly wonderful, particularly on the original vinyl soundtrack albums!"
4,Eagerly Awaited CD,"I own this recording in vinyl, but since my LP platter is in mothballs, I was waiting it to come out in CD. From time to time I searched the Erroll Garner recordings until finally today I hit the jackpot. The one cut on this recording which mattered me the most is a Garner's composition, Farewell to Paris. It has a poignant quality that is very difficult to describe. I've been to Paris three times in different years, 2005, 2006 and 2008, and every time I leave the city I find myself humming this song. My search is finally over! All other numbers in this recording are well worth the listening, in Erroll's inimitable style."
3,For Garnerites only...,"Okay, in fairness I should mention that I bought the original LP set when it came out way back when. Over time it became a favorite, until someone relieved me of it several years ago. This is the main reason I purchased the CD.Having said that I must admit, upon review, that much of Mr. Ferris' complaints are justified. The overall sound isn't the best -- especially on the first disc where EG pounds on the harpsichord to the extent that it's an overbearing mess. The second disc, however, is a gem! His rendition of ""Paris Blues"" makes up for his heavy-handed technique on the first set and the entire disc is filled with treats (and wonderful memories, for me, at least!).One and a half stars for the first set; 4 and a half for the second."
4,Confused,"Like most of the other reviewers this is a Garner gem. However, I originally had two vinyl albums which were Vols. one and two and then a few years ago I found Vol one only on CD. Paris Impressions definitely had two volumes = CBS 466545 & CBS 466546. Can anyone provide any information as to why the second CD is not available.Erroll Garner was like no other pianist. Critics who hear his playing as romantic seem to miss the point. His inventiveness and improvisation which is so distinctive places him in a category of its own. Substitute poetic in place of romantic and you hear who he actually is. I saw him play just once in Australia where he played his heart out, but he did seem tired and died a few years later. I now live in the USA and jazz had something to do with my decision. The main reason was I met my wife to be, while on tour in the US with an Australian Jazz Orchestra.Jazz has changed my life on many occasions and I am very thankful for that.Pilgarlic."
1,Atrocious,"Do not buy this 2-CD set unless you can tolerate atrocious recording quality.Students of the great masters can certainly learn from any examples of their works, but no one will ever listen to this set for enjoyment. The sound is uniformly muddy. And Garner's harpsichord work on four of his original compositions sounds as if the instrument were being played in a tunnel.It's difficult to believe that anyone actually listened to this set before releasing it. Most of the material is available on other recordings."
1,Awful...really,"This is my first review after many, many Amazon purchases. This cd was so bad, I had to write. The children were awful singers. I feel badly, as a mother, for such a poor review of children, but it was really that bad."
2,"Overpriced, Flimsy Mold","This was not as high quality of a product as I expected considering how much I paid for the product + shipping. I agree with the previous reviewer who complained that the shipping was ridiculously high. The product was so light and thin that it definitely shouldn't have cost that much to ship. The mold was a bit flimsy and part of the plastic split the first time I used it. I'm a beginning chocolate maker, so maybe I didn't use the product correctly, but I still expected it to be a little more durable."
3,"This band contains a male, a male from anathema",Its alot different from anthema. I would classify it as a spacey alternative album. Theres quite a few really good songs such as mary agnes&lid but there are alot of bad ones too. Lyrics pretty much are stupid but like I always say a butter is his brown.
4,pretty good,"they're the cheapest shelf supports i could find in white, they're sturdy and i wouldn't worry about them breaking under shelf weight, also shipped pretty fast"
2,There is a reason these songs were unsung.,"I suppose from a historian's point of view this would be an interesting collection. But if you want Berlin songs that you can tap your foot to, or chuckle at the lyrics, this is not the CD to buy. Neither the songs nor the artists are very enjoyable."
3,Pretty good single.,"Yes, only 'pretty good'. I bought this at FYE for just 49 cents, but with the list price, not really worth it. You'll like the songs on here though. If you have ""Silver Side Up"" and ""The State"", don't buy this."
4,The Quintessential Radio Song That Is Luckily Pretty Good.,"Nickelback is second only to Insane Clown Posse as the most hated band on the Internet. I'm not even a huge fan of them, but I think this tune and most of their other hits are proof enough that they deserve none of the incredible amount of abuse they endure from Those Who Know Best.""How You Remind Me"" is a dynamic, somewhat heavy pop rock song that's lyrically vague enough for anyone with a broken heart to relate to. It wastes no time doing what it's meant to do and I smile whenever it comes on whatever bland pop station that's being piped into the dentist's office, doctor's waiting room, and many supermarkets and fast food restaurants in my life."
1,Poor quality,"The set looks a lot better in pictures than it does in real life. I also had the misfortune to spend a little more on it than what it costs now.I bought both the metric and standard sets. The casting is aweful. Some of the wrenches have pits and gashes, while others are outright misshapen. The case is flimsy and ill-fitted.I recommend that you either spend more money on a better set, or buy a cheaper set, because it's practically impossible to make a worse quality tool than this."
3,good for the home mechanic to use every once in a while,"They're good enough for a home mechanic to use on occasion, but not if you intend to use them every week in a shop. )Even as often as an entry level auto tech needs them) They're good enough for the average DIY, but not for a professional tech."
5,A Thousand Miles of Mustangin',"Ben K. Green was a cowboy who could spin a yarn as well as ride a horse or rope a steer. In this Wild West Adventure, young Ben sets off at the end of the Great Depression to Mexico to try to find an elusive band of mustangs. Along the way he meets some colorful characters, gathers quite a herd of horses and mules, and has to figure out how to get them back home and sell them to make the one-year journey worthwhile. A wonderful adventure, chock-full of humor, told with a west Texas drawl. You will feel that you are sitting around the campfire late at night after another day on the trail listening to Ben tell his tales. Get ready to be entertained! This book is Ben K. Green at his best."
4,Pure Jackie...,"Now I am going to be somewhat bias in my review simply because I know Mr. Burke and his family from my years as a cart boy at Champions during the mid-80s'.I would, and have, recommended this book to my friends who golf and my non-golf friends.One of my favorite parts in the book is when he talks about being an Assistant Captain on the Ryder Cup Team with Chris Riley."
4,YES!!,"My husband and I both love the song ""Spirit in the Sky"" -- one of the great all-time hits! Must admit, didn't care much for the other songs in the collection, but it was worth the price to be able to listen to ""Spirit in the Sky"" whenever we want! Great music, great lyrics!"
4,Not what it seems at first blush,"It's funny to know that some people think of ""Spirit In the Sky"" as a spiritual song or some sort of early Christian rock.""Spirit"" comes across as pretty conceited and pretentious, if you listen to the (pretty simplistic) lyrics. Example: ""I've never been a sinner, I've never sinned."" Yeah, right. I just can't buy this as any sort of spiritual thing. It sounds like a lot of bragging.Other than that, the tune is pretty catchy. Heck, I guess at least I should be glad he's singing about God instead of death and decay like these doom-and-gloom Goth weirdos.The other stuff on the album is nowhere near as good...basically filler from a one-hit wonder."
1,The Drinker You Play the Smoker You Get,"I guess Norman G. & Co. may have enjoyed recording this material, but except for his One Hit, this CD is really lame. 'Spirit In The Sky' pretty much sums up religion (buying stairways to heaven on an installment plan), and it's got one of the most recognizable & memorable guitar licks ever committed to tape. The rest is completely disposable--I don't even think you can find it being given away on NAPSTER.Next time a bunch of dope smoking hippies offer you a CD, make sure they are giving you a ""full bag"" of what it is you're paying for, and not just a load of dry weeds."
3,Goes downhill after a promising start.,"One of the students at an exclusive private shool which practices a unique type of ""intensive therapy"" turns out to be a mutant with strange and even messianic powers. He can physically merge with others, causing a transformation or ""enlightenment"" to occur within the others.There's rather a confusion of characters and plotlines which becomes tiresome in time. Yet, it's basically an interesting story, just not likely to interest the more selective reader."
2,throws my tone out the window,"i play alto, flute, and oboe in band and i tried these reeds because i wanted the projection, but still crystal clear tone quality. they did project, but were difficult to get a good solid sound out of. they did help me play better in tune. but my peave is when my tone isn't perfect, and my least favorite is when the tone is fuzzy and airy. this is the type of tone that was produced with these reeds. sure they'll last longer, but i have found it difficult to articulate. so if you want your sound to be clear, my opinion is to find other ones."
4,Very effective,"I need to rescind my previous review of one star due to not being able to get the battery cover off. I thought I needed a smaller screwdriver, when, in actuality, I needed a bigger one. When I found the right size screwdriver, the battery cover came off. There is a switch to turn the ""eyes"" on and off, which is a good feature. They really did need to make the battery cover more easy to get off, but with the right size screwdriver, it will come off..."
1,Failure,"After four months the light has failed. Do not know why, since it was purportedly designed to work out of doors, but was forewarned by another reviewer that it can fail prematurely. That is now two of us. I intend to return/obtain refund. Two failures is too much. Mine does not get any rain whatsoever, so that is not the problem. Would not buy until their QC problems get solved, and how will you know?"
1,Total junk,"I had great interest in this solar powered grill light, but its performance is so poor that it appears to be a total sham. The 're-chargeable' batteries that came with it would not charge in either of the 2 battery chargers I have (that charge all my other AA rechargeable batteries. However, even with good, fully charged AA batteries and 12 days in the bright San Diego sunshine, the light lasted less than 4 minutes and would not re-light, It is no bargain for sure and I am returning it as soon as the postal holiday ends."
1,The truth,"I purchased 2 of these GL-04's. The cover for the battery compartment is poorly designed. On both units I bought, I literally had to use a screw driver to pry open the battery compartment. I can assure this was done as a very last resort. As a result, it now doesn't shut tightly. The battery cover is not at all weather resistant (even before I tried to open it) and the list of features listed on the box, make no weather resistant claims. Such claims are only made online ""Use rain or shine, outdoor and salt-spray tested"". In fact the instructions actually state ""store the lamp indoors when not in use and DO NOT IMMERSE IN WATER"". Wanna hear some more false advertisement? The instructions state ""The lamps charge lasts up to 1.75 hrs. after a days exposure to full sun"". The online advertisement states ""it can shine up to 4 hours continuously after full sunlight charging""."
1,Doesn't work!,"Alas, despite my efforts to go green, no Solar powered light has delivered satisfactory results, including this item. Seems the solar just can't produce enough power. I live in Scottsdale Arizona with an average of 360 days of sunshine - if it can't work here, I don't think it'll work anywhere. This BBQ light would come on for mere seconds, then turn off. Certainly not enought time to bbq our steaks:( I've returned it and kept the battery operated bbq light also found on Amazon."
5,A New Exciting Approach To Learning A Foreign Language,"I have taken many French courses and purchased many French language books but have had difficulty retaining want I had learned. Learning through memorization became tedious and started to feel more like a chore. However French By Association offered a different approach. Through its ""learning by association"" principle, I have been able to learn new words very quickly in a fun way and more importantly, I have been able to retain the information. I have learned to create a mental image of the words so that when I am thinking of a word a mental image appears, the wackier the better. This is my first review of a book on Amazon. I thought it would be important to share my view with people who may be experiencing difficulty in learning another language. I highly recommend it. Best of Luck!"
3,"Good idea, regrettable execution","The technique of association is actually quite useful in picking up vocabulary. Unfortunately, the vocabulary you will pick up here is so limited -- and the ""associations"" so strained -- that I found it to be of little use.Still, the idea behind association is sound, and if you create your own associations to fix difficult words into your mind, you'll find yourself picking up a foreign language much more quickly. I'd recommend using this book to learn the technique, then making up associations of your own to memorize words with which you are having difficulty.This is also not a book which will stand on its own: use this in conjunction with another text or set of texts."
1,Terrible Quality,Several of the capsules had burst before we got them and there is oil all over all of the other capsules. New ones burst regularly. It makes for a really gross bottle of supplements. We take evening primrose oil daily and I was hoping that subscribing to this product would give me easy re-upping but I cancelled my subscription.
5,OutStanding,Classy act of two french recording artists with an older Cd just as Good.All tracks are outstanding.. BUY IT..... FrenCh R&B like you have never heard
2,MUST HAVE!!!,I thank God for this book. It has helped me so much. I have read it over and over again. If you have had a miscarriage you need to read this book.
3,"Not awful, but not great.","This is not a bad book. It has quite a few good tips on saving money on groceries and a good variety of recipes. It just didn't really fit our needs. I made four or five recipes from this book and then sold it. None of them were bad, but they were all either a little bland or a little sweet. I imagine this may be a plus if you're cooking for small children or someone who doesn't like strong flavors, but we prefer our food more highly seasoned. I could have adjusted things but the recipes weren't interesting enough to motivate me to do so."
3,"Cheap, Fast, Good","Interesting book but not what I expected. Recipes different however, the couple that I have used did turn out pleasant."
4,Cheap. Fast. Good - And worth the money!,"I borrowed the book from the library 3 times and finally bought it a few weeks ago. I've made several recipes and we've enjoyed them all. This isn't gourmet, but it's tasty. Some recipes are a little plainer than we like, but the authors encourage experimenting and using what you have, so with a little extra seasoning they work well for us. They give lots of tips for altering recipes, and some really good shopping tips. Of the 15 or 20 recipe books I own, I've already made more from this one than any of the others."
2,"If you like ""bleh"", then by all means...","In a nutshell, page 26 contains a recipe for Pasta E Fagioli, a hearty Italian soup enjoyed for decades if not centuries by natives and transplants alike. Yet this recipe calls for zero salt and one clove of garlic to a recipe that adds over 7 cans of liquid and beans. Now, I'm no cook by any means, but I've been in and worked in kitchens long enough to know that the result of this miscalculation of flavorings would be akin to gruel made by boy scout campers who had nothing to create a stew with but what they found in the woods on a weekend retreat with their dads.Seriously though, we've tried five or six of these recipes and only found one worth doing again. Thumbs down from all four family members. Goodwill crowd, you're next."
5,This cookbook is GREAT!,"I was in a cooking funk myself, doing the same thing over & over and this book has been a muse, rejuvenating my cooking ideas and menus. I've cooked 10 meals so far from it and each one is a home run, in terms of time, cost and quality!"
3,Pink Shoe Laces not original hit recording,"I thought I should warn anyone interested in buying ""History of Dot 2"" that the song ""Pink Shoe Laces"" by Dodie Stevens is most likely not the original hit version.I haven't bought this C.D. but I do no that Dot records never obtained the master from Crystelette records where the hit version was made and released in 1959 so all Dot releases were re-recorded of the song which really is bad.When I interviewed Dodie Stevens years ago on my Oldies show in Yuma, Arizona she confirmed this information.So, unlesss someone pulled some strings this is going to be a real disapointment if you're buying this C,D, for Pink Shoe Laces.It's too bad they did not include her follow up hit titled: ""NO"" from 1960 on Dot.That is original and a great song."
4,Ka pow!,"If you like the Master's. Then you like this CD. If you don't, then this CD could change your mind. Just good ole fashioned rockin' with no filler. Music to kill a king by."
4,Wish For A Fish,"Masters of reality have walked a long way, several changes of lineup from a six members band to a quartet to a duet and a large list of collaborations, Mark Lanegan, Josh Homme, Nick Ollivieri, even ex-Cream Ginger Baker on drums, this deliver ""Deep In The Hole"" explores the stoner,progresive and alternative rock fields its also perhaps the release with more classic cuts such as ""third man on the moon"", ""Deep in the hole"" , ""High Noon Amsterdam"" and my new fave ""wish for a fish"" the most i find interesting with MOR is that combination of heavy/soft riffs and soft vocals and interesting kinda intellectual and poetic lyrics, the formula maybe is not unique but in this sea of repetitive pop proposals were musical explorations are zero and appealing is based on the performers and not focused on the music is one of the few very few options you can find to listen something with enough quality to be consider a high profile style.HM"
3,What Was He Thinking?,"I am a big fan of the first two MOR cd's. When I got this and gave it a spin I about fainted. The three stars are because it is a good rock album, but it is not a good MOR album. I miss the old band! You can't hear the old rock influnce from the first 2 cd's. I would start with them, and maybe get this one used."
4,Visions of Sugarpluum: Mimi Sherator,"Whoops! I purchased this book, but was sent another one, Visions of Sugarplums, 1992. It's not a bad book, but I was disappointed that I didn't get the one I ordered. I think I'd rate Sheraton's book at least a 4, probably a 5. Donna Gibson"
2,Buy a different book,"I bought mine on ebay after reading the reviews from Amazon.I bought this wanting to price my Pokemon cards since it said it covered 251 Pokemon. I know its an old book and there's tons more cards out but i thought it would be fun anyway. The thing is that it only actually covers the first 151 Pokemon and the rest are like a sneak peak at what would have came out at the time. Pokemon 152-251 are in Japanese (i.e. totodile is waninoko), with only the Japanese card and some don't even have one. The art is like a kid drew it and the colors aren't even right. You cant even match your card to the one in the picture, some don't even show the card its pricing. Theres another book called ""Pokemon Collector's Value Guide: Secondary Market Price Guide and Collector Handbook"" that is much better than this book."
5,Noticed less hair loss,"I am a female over 40 and was starting to notice that my hair was thinning. Doctor could find no cause. Since taking this product, I have noticed less hair loss in drain after a shower and less in hair brush. Not to mention hair is starting to look like it's trying to ""fill in"". I totally recommend this product. The label says that it is more potent than evening primrose oil and I believe it because I have also noticed less breast tenderness around ""that time of the month""."
5,It is what it is!,"Indeed, it is Black Currant Oil. I take it for hair health along with B6, Omega's, and a high protein diet. So, it's hard to measure what the Black Currant Oil does on its own. Indeed, I do have fast growing, healthy, extra long hair. I recommend this product."
4,Not for me,"I have been ordering the black currant oil for my husband. He seems to think it works for him, so I will order it as long as he wants. I would recommend this product."
3,Black current,I haven't taken this consistently enough to comment appropriately. Dr. Oz recommended taking this for hair loss and it could take up to a few months. Because the capsules are made of gelatin and I'm vegetarian I have to open them up and squeeze out the oil. I've seemingly lost interest in this time consuming process. Wish they had vegetarian capsules.
5,7-Keto,I have taken 7-Keto for quite sometime and it gives me energy. The service was fast and price is a good value.
3,Review of Nutricity Product Black Currant Oil,"The product I received was exactly as advertised and expected. As previously stated, the company did not respond to me when I e mailed them twice and as well the product took over a week past their stated mailing deadline to get here. I think that mail from the U.S. to other places takes longer than the post office tells and that should be factored into their estimates. Also, communication with customers is important to confidence and would hope that they aim to answer their e mails through Amazon. However, I did receive what I ordered and it is exactly what I wanted."
3,Ok product.,It's really hard to tell if it works or not. Overall fair value for the amount of product you get for your money.
3,Didn't hurt. Didn't help.,I bought this product to help with my dry & cracking fingers. I have since learned that Benedril helps more than anything I've tried thus far. I am not sure of the other benefits of this product but it didn't help my situation.
3,ok,"wife bought this for her hair and nails, but she can not tell a difference at this point. she will give it a few more months"
1,Capsules came all stuck together,Not sure if these were exposed to heat before or during shipping but all 3 bottles I ordered have every capsule stuck together. I can barely get them out of the container and it's difficult to get even one unstuck from the group. Will not order from this manufacturer again.
4,Hell Baby,"Overall, I enjoyed Hell Baby. I finished it in one sitting. I thought it was an interesting manga but it could have been better. I felt that it was really short and that there could have been more to it. I did feel bad for Hell Baby and grew somewhat attached to her. Would I recommend it? Sure. If you're in the mood for a short horror manga."
4,All the Hino you want,"In this standalone tale from Hideshi Hino, you see an abandoned twin left to die in a garbage dump, unwanted by her family and ostracized from all civilization. Hell Baby is without speech for the entire book, though this is one of the better devices this story uses. Throughout the shriek!'s you come to feel for this character of circumstance -- this HELL BABY -- and Hino's sympathetic side appears between a mad picture of grotesque imagery and sharp allegory.Some may be turned off from this story for its blood and gore, but underneath this Graveyard of Horror is a quirky and fine-tuned story of redemption and even forgiveness. Recommended."
5,Music to Eat Spinach By,"This is one of my all-time favourite albums of easy listening music. I often find myself turning to this CD when I wish to relax and revel in the artifacts of a seemingly more cultured and civilised time. To me, it's a great antidote to the harshness of our current age.Steve Allen was an immensely talented performer, and these tracks display very well his gift for composing and choosing great tunes. There is a fairly wide variety of tunes and arrangements here, as can be expected from a collection that was culled from at least a half-dozen albums from the late 50's to the mid 60's.The CD comes with excellent liner notes, which include information on the various albums from which each track was picked, as well as a few words from Mr. Allen himself -from which I got the title of this review. All in all, this is an exceedingly enjoyable collection of music, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves quality easy listening and light jazz."
4,Root lift,"I like this product, and use other ""TIGI"" products, so I figured this would also be good, I was right, I would recommend this to get a good root lift."
5,Awesome seasoning~!,"My family absolutely loves when I season things with this. Our favorite is Salmon. I will sprinkle this on (the kids lightly, and ours with tons) and then broil the fish. No oil no butter, then we put it on burgers and have salmon burgers for dinner! We love it!"
5,Like getting a whole new machine,"My Dell Inspiron 1100 was so slow (I usually run several Word documents and a couple of Explorer windows at once) that I was going to return the laptop. But tripling the memory rendered it worth what I originally spent, plus the sixty bucks for extra RAM. Shame on Dell for shipping a machine with XP and not warning me how unusable it would be without extra memory.Laptop has run fine for months now, and installation took only a Swiss army knife and fewer than 5 minutes. I'm very pleased."
3,A standard action score with a Goldsmith twist.,"Ok, we've all heard average action scores. While the movie Executive Decision is nothing special, Goldsmith compliments it well with his orchestral score. This score is not as memorable as some of his other works, but is still interesting. The CD only contains about 30 minutes of music."
2,"Weird, Wild Stuff","I have seen part of this film on broadcast TV (with bad reception) a long time ago. I would like to see the whole thing, but am not sure I want to buy it to do so--I've read a few actual reviews--none good.But...Chris Walken has a fun role, Margot Kidder (before her breakdown), along with a number of other respectable actors all do a decent job.The section of the film I've seen, perhaps 30 minutes, follows the troop of this idiosyncratic quest through the Mexican desert, in an attempt, I believe, to find Montezuma's gold--using a giant, carved disk of rock (think 8 foot diameter, foot thick Mayan calender) as a map...If you like strange bits of cinema, and you can find a copy of this, I'd check it out, but I don't know enough to say you will actually like it..."
4,remembering Yadier,"Yadier Molina did something amazing a few nights ago- in the 9th inning, he hit a 2-run homerun in game 7 against the New York Mets to send the Cardinals to the World Series. It was an amazing moment for Cardinals fans, especially when you consider Yadier isn't typically you're homerun-hitting kind of guy.This is a beautifully-designed card showing Yadier Molina with perfect detail. A must have."
2,"Cheesey book, but informative","I have read this book in short spurts since my wife first became pregnant five and a half months ago. The book is cheesy, elementary and slightly pandering, but in small doses, it has useful information. When your wife becomes pregnant, things are going to change, but not really for nine months. That's why reading this book for about five to ten minutes a day has been useful for thinking about things I might not otherwise think about without the previous experience to know (i.e having a baby). Things in the book include what to expect when you get to the hospital, best times to tell the boss, and advice that drinking & doing drugs is bad for you. Real insightful (yeah, right)."
4,short and sweet,"This book is the assigned reading for the Event Planning certification course I'm taking. It's great, very concise and to-the-point. Lots of realistic resources and handy tips."
2,Very boring,If you're looking for something interesting about Event Planning do NOT buy this book. Has some good information in it however very boring.
2,The Countess de Charny,"This copy which I purchased from Amazon was printed by Walking Lion Press. It has by far the most typographical errors that I have ever seen in one book. At times it became a guessing game as to what a word was really supposed to be. This book is part of a series, but one has to investigate other works of Dumas to discern what the other books are. Professional publishers would have them listed in the book for the reader. I am a huge Dumas fan, but this work is tedious to get through especially in the early chapters. If you do buy it, seek a different publisher than the one I mentioned earlier."
1,way too many typos,This book by bingo bloomers publishing has way too many typos that it makes the reading almost impossible. It is like no one proof read and just sent it out and it is horrible. Ruins the whole story. I would buy from another publisher if possible because do not buy from them. frustrating.
2,"Repetitive, boring and lacking of any real energy/emotion","One of the most important aspects of music, in my opinion, is the ammount of energy and emotion a band can convey with their music. When a song is able to pull you by your collar and punch you in the face, you know its good. Sadly, The Class of 98' writes no such song. Similar to songs by daphney loves derby or coldplay, none of these mind-numbingly emotionless ballads would sound out of place on a department store elevator. Thats not a good thing. When you have to fiddle with you fingers or think about something else, you're probably not enjoying what you're listening to. Forgettable? You bet it is. Touch this and die? Don't worry, I'll never pick it up again."
5,Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing,"The script is a one and a million type of script. The pre production and production notes are a added bonus . This book is for all film lovers not just ""Do the Right Thing"" fans . If you love reading scripts this is a must have."
1,too many errors,"The other reader only pointed out one major error in this book. I have only read ten pages in the Yzerman section and have identified four errors. Detroit is not located on the St.Clair River, New Jersey swept the Wings in the finals the lockout season,obviously not the year they won 62 games, Yzerman did not lose the Calder Trophy to Steve Larmer, and Yzerman's oldest daughter is named Isabella. Perhaps the author should stick to broadcasting and let people who know how to research or, at least find people who can research, do the writing."
3,good but a bit too gooey and sweet for me,"These fruit slices come in a great variety of yummy flavors: cherry, watermelon, lime, pear, grape, and more. But unfortunately they were a little too sweet for my taste.Another point of displeasure was the consistency of the slices. I found them to be more gooey than previous fruit slices I've eaten. I even tried refrigerating them in the hope that they would become a bit tougher, but no luck.I think if you prefer sweeter, softer candies these would be great for you."
5,Fruit slices,"The fruit slices were very delicious, tasted better then I expected, would order them again for a gift next year."
3,Boston or Canada?,"The gooey consistency suggests these slices come from the Canadian supplier. Nothing against Canada (I'm sipping a Canadian beer right now), but the Boston fruit slices are less messy and have a better mouthfeel."
1,WORST FRUIT SLICES CANDY IN THE WORLD!!!,"THESE ARE THE WORST FRUIT SLICES CANDY I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE!!! THESE HAVE NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER.....LIKE EATING PASTE.I DON'T KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANUFACTURING THIS HIGHLY INFERIOR CANDY PRODUCT,BUT I HOPE THEY GO OUT OF BUSINESS VERY SOON!!! THE BOSTON BRAND FRUIT SLICES YOU SEE ON AMAZON ARE FANTASTIC AND TASTE JUST THE WAY FRUIT SLICES CANDYB ARE SUPPOSED TO TASTE."
5,Great Card,"I bought this card n 2004 when i got my first kodak 2mp camera, it never failed me and is still working (although not using it anymore) great card. great brand"
1,Southwestern cooking for those who shun southwestern cooking,"In my lifetime of cooking southwestern food I've never read a book that contained so many ghastly sounding recipes.This is Santa Fe cooking as distorted by the rich people who have driven most Santa Feans out of the city. Even the chile required (and Ms. Stacy does spell chile correctly) is mild or medium. The food is bland and contains endless tomatoes and almost flavorless roasted garlic.Don't fail to buy the book if you like phony Santa Fe cooking. You might enjoy it. But please, I beg you, don't call it southwestern. It isn't.<P"
2,Scandal and Libel,"Mr. Weissengruber's ""review"" of ""Sugar Shack"" is typical of devious ""hipsters"" who do not appreciate good old fashioned Rock and Roll.Quibbling over the pronunciation of ""espresso"" suggests that Mr. Weissengruber has nothing to do with the real pulse of rock and roll.The kind of pulse throbbing in the voice of Gilmer completely toasts the tepid spirit of Weissengruber's elitist view of rock and roll. Indeed, it toasts the ""very idea"" of Weissengruber"
1,Can you say boring!!!,"The only good metal gear was the 1st one. Or the actual gear that was metal, it is real! But really all the games so far have sucked bid time. Playing the games are like watching really stupid movies that don't make sense. You have to be a real loser to like some hippy that wheres a headband and has a lame name like ""snake"". But there is a cool hero called ""Master Chief"" that would kick stupid snakes ass. Instead of buying another lame game just get halo or halo 2, doom3, halflife 2 or any game because it will have to be better that more of this metal crap."
1,is this a joke?,it's comming out in november.it's out of any questionto even talk about such game yet to be released.lets talk after the game is released. ihope it to be released on time i hope.
4,mgs 3 awesome,Its a cool game cause you get to go around blowin' people's heads off.It spews too.On the trailer isn't survive to live obvious?!It's all cool except the end cause that's a little wierd.
3,"OK, but I've played better.","I played this game at a Konomi engineer's home. It's pretty cool. But it's not what people are expecting. Since it takes place in the 1960s, alot of it takes place in space and on the moon. It's gets a little lame because the only way you can kill people is by running them over with your moon rover and hitting them with your golf club. The coolest part is analyzing moon rocks through a microscope. What amazing chrystallization!Bottom line, I'd wait for Metal Gear Solid 4: Polyurethane Gear. It's lighter, cheaper and won't rust."
3,Great for a newbie..,"This book is great for a newbie but if you are a professional, don't bother. If you are just starting to learn about photography/lighting, I do recommend this book. I enjoyed reading it although I didn't take much from it."
4,World War I,"From the title you cannot tell, but this is the story of the first correspondents (one of seven total) covering the battles in World War I. We have seen plenty of newsreels of the battles in WWII, but this gives you a realistic picture of the filth in the trenches and the huge cost in manpower. Good read."
1,Worse than Trash,The only reason I gave this 1 star was there was no option to select zero stars. This is just an ancient piece of communist propaganda trying to disguise itself as literature. I would recommend it as toilet paper but it's an ebook and that just makes your ebook reader messy.
1,CONSUMER BEWARE!!!,"CONSUMER BEWARE!!! Amazon Unbox has now cost me $6. Download completes and when unbox coverts temp download file to video file it only puts in the artwork, no video file."
3,Really summary level,"The information in this book is at such a summary level, it's difficult to really get an understanding of the material. Each chapter is 10 pages or less, and in those ten pages, the subject could be all of the major Native American groups on the North American Continent. It will be difficult to keep these groups separate with very little detail to keep them straight. I have had to supplement with quite a bit of outside reading materials to make the learning substantial enough to really have a student glean any worthwhile information. As a guide for important areas to study, it's great - but I couldn't see using this as your sole Social Studies text.And where are the tests?"
1,Not sure what to say,This product did NOT allow me to use my phone and DSL connections at the same time.
4,Good product,"It's a very good product, specially for the price. It seems comfortable and safe for my chihuahua, the only thing that is not so great for me, is that to open it you have to unzip from the bottom and your pet can get out. Other than that, it's a very good product for such a low price."
5,Am Israel Chai-The People of Israel Live,"An incredible musical tribute of the wonderful land of Israel and its beautiful people.This is stirring and inspiring music about the appreciation of the land and people.Older folk hits and more current stuff like that by hot girl band.My personal favourites include the upbeat Hora by Avi Toledano, Balalayka by Ilanit ,the beautiful Halleluya by Chalav Udevash , Tzena Tzena by Ge'ula Gil , Hava Nagila by Haparvarim , and Bashana Haba'Ah - Yaffa Yarkoni.The album ends with a stirring rendition of the Israeli national anthem Hatikva by the CBS Israeli orchestra and choir.This is a wonderful album that will hook you right away and always make you feel good.One of my firm favourites."
5,"Forget ""Everywhere,"" the bonus tracks are enough","The Unplugged versions of AYW and GTY are incredible! I recently bought this and am very glad that i did.The enhanced CD has a movie player built in that lets you watch the ""Everywhere"" video.Definitly worth getting!"
5,Go Michelle!,I really liked the nice unplugged versions of All You Wanted and Goodbye To You. Michelle does a great acoustic performance. How is this version of the Everywhere CD single any different than the other one with the code B00005RYCD?
4,The American Revolution from a British point of view.,"A very enjoyable and thought provoking book. This is definitely not how we teach the origins or the progress of that lengthy struggle here in the US. Our dearly held romanticized view of the founding fathers motivations and methods takes a bit of a beating, as does the early generalship of Washington. King George III and the other Parliamentary leadership are portrayed not as bumbling oppressors but as overindulgent uncles really unwilling to harshly punish the transgressions of a wayward nephew.While I don't buy it all its certainly another viewpoint that is quite valid and the book is well worth reading."
3,OK for the price,"I bought this ($15) when I ditched Comcast cable -- I hated paying for the HD signals, which are free, but which Comcast charges for. I bought the antenna to pick up local HDTV channels, and it was pretty good, but it wouldn't pick up the station I wanted most (PBS). It would pick up about 10 channels, but PBS was spotty at best, and often I would see the dreaded ""No Signal"" message gliding across the screen when I switched to PBS.Then, I went out and bought the RCA ANT111 model, which had pretty good reviews on the Best Buy site, and low and behold it picked up the KQED channel! Not bad for a $10 antenna! I'm glad I cut the cord on cable -- I was paying $100 a month to watch essentially junk reality shows on Bravo -- what a waste!"
4,"Interesting, but slightly off target","Michener was an elector for Humphrey in 1968, and came face to face with the bad features of our electoral system. But He ended up making a proposal that keeps a lot of its defects, only because he focused on the things that could have gone wrong in 1968. His preferred solution, the automatic electoral vote, would not have made the slightest difference if it had been in place in 2000, for example.We need a reform of our Presidential election system. With that I agree. But Michener's preferred solution is not the one we need."
3,"I really like the music, but...he needs back up","Robben Ford is a great talent that deserves even more attention. While the concert captures Robbens style and skills, it comes across rather flat, mostly because he needs better backup. As usual, he gives time for his fellow performers to take the spot light. Unfortunately, they just aren't up to par. There is a drum solo on one of these DVDs that is amateur night, definitely not what is expected from a top performer. So, I give Robben a three rating based on his tasteful and creative songs and guitar, but the rating is dragged down by the lack of professional back up and production. Still, it is exciting and worth the investment just to see this creative artist doing his thing."
1,Total garbage,"This book is totally lacking in credibility. It has been discredited by other more trustworthy sources. Frankos story on the Hoffa murder, for one, is a total fabrication. Please, do some research (read ""The Westies,"" for instance, a much more jouranlistically credible source) and you will find that this book is FICTION disguised as fact. That is, if you care."
1,Under impressed.,Had it hung up for one day and one of the ties on one side broke off. The tie parts are sewn on poorly.
3,Not sure how others have hung this on their wall,"Excellent for organizing my baby daughter's stuffed animals (she's only 4 months old and received a lot of stuffed toys as presents already). Definitely a lot prettier than the toy bag nets/hammocks. However, I don't know how others have hung this up on their wall. The only way to attach this toy bag is by the side ties/ribbon on either end of the bag (in the item photo, it's the ribbon part) - works well if you want to tie this to the railings of your crib. But to the wall - could not figure out how to do it. At first, I nailed the back part of the toy bag to the wall but the weight of the stuffed animals pulled the fabric out (and the stuffed animals aren't that heavy).I had to attach a cafe curtain rod to the wall then tie the toy bag to it (which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars)."
1,Bad description,"This item looks very good and I was going to order it until I looked at the description which says it measures 1"" by 1"" inch. this is obviously an error and needs to be corrected if it is going to sell. I would order it if I need the accurate dimensions."
3,"Funny, but a little misleading","SPOILER ALERT:Read this book very quickly - interesting, very humorous, and occasionally even inspiring. However, I was disappointed to realize that Coyne comes nowhere close to qualifying for Q-School. Despite the book's subtitle and the author's incessant work to improve, Coyne has a lot of trouble breaking 80, much less becoming a tournament threat. This became obvious towards the end of the book and kind of ruined the original drama."
5,Tom Coyne is a champion writer (and golfer),"If you have been playing golf for any length of time you probably understand the love/hate relationship that develops between you and the game, the agony and ecstasy of thrilling shots and pull-hooked drives. This book captures one man's adventure incredibly well. He is a top tier golfer, rusty from years of less than top tier golfing, and he dedicates a year to trying to compete on the main stage again. His tale is eloquent and funny, heartbreaking and endearing. Great stuff. If Tom Coyne's golf was on the level of his writing he would be Tiger Woods."
2,Anti-climactic and disappointing,"Finally a book about an average guy dropping everything to see if he could make the tour. But that's what professional golfers are not: Average. Even the lowest professional golfer can shoot even par in his sleep, yet the author really struggles to break 80. This is more a funny anecdotal story that any golfer could aspire to but it would have been better if he could actually play. The second half of the book, skips around injuries and yawn...became a kind of mumbling and boring marriage proposal. Overall this book builds up a great story, but becomes anti-climatic and boring. What it is, a delusional tale. What it is not, reality."
5,S-I-C-K-N-E-S-S,"*if you have a PULSE, you might find these chunes to be at bare minimum incredible! - continuing on in the tradition of strong up front stormers w/ the international epic trance sounds mixed to perfection this time around by UK heavyweight LANGE & powerhouse up n' comer PLASTIC ANGEL - beautiful melodic, intense - AWESOME - 2 was phenomenal & the third installment definitely delivered the goods! Keep it up w/ the tight releases water music DANCE [HI-BIAS] - SOLID - ALL KILLER, NO FILLER... PROPER.[8NCI3NT raw_unknown]"
5,Brilliant but with one qualification,"Spoon's voice sounds almost gone on this, but I still give this CD five stars because of the absolutely beautiful and top notch guitar work by Robben Ford. I've admired him for many years and this CD remains one of my very favorites. A towering performance by a blues guitar virtuoso."
5,A Singer and Actress with Understated style,"My favorite singers are Cleo Laine, Betty Buckley (when she is NOT belting like in Heart to Heart), and Christine Andreas. I first acquired her New Ways to Dream and immediately liked her. She has a very quiet but intimate approach in interpreting a song. In particular, The March of the Siamese Twins is worth listening. If you could acquire her other record DO SO. Her interpretations of As If We Never Said Goodbye and As Long as He Needs Me are definitive."
3,Not Akh best,"I am a huge fan of Akhenaton, but this is far from his best work. I still think he is the best french rapper out there. His lastest work is much better."
5,Fun and educational,"Our 3 year old loves this game, and is able to recognize letters and count. His skills have improved as he plays the game more frequently. There are two sets of cards, one more advanced. Parents can adjust the game and make it more creative. The pieces are colorful and the game is durable. Excellent! Recommend for all families who want more French exposure for children without resorting to videos."
5,Excellent Book and a must Read,"The story was phenomenal and I salute to Greg's dedication and committment to the cause of educating girls in Pakistan, sepcially in remote areas in north. Narration was excellent as well as content was well picked. Highly recommend everyone to read it and help with Greg's noble cause."
3,I want to like it so much more!!!,"I really want to LOVE this book. I got to page 125 and had to stop and check reviews....is it going to get less wordy and more engaging? From the reviews it doesn't look like it. I have started to skip entire paragraphs and don't feel like I am missing anything by doing so. I was hesitant to even continue the story after reading the first 10 pages because I don't enjoy Relin's writing style...yes, there is such thing as TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION....get on with the story Relin! I really enjoy hearing from Greg, and I am only going to continue reading because I think that what he has accomplished is incredible. He is a wonderful example of the difference one person can make in the world."
1,If it's a lie.........,I am saddened that such a good story could be ruined by yet another author's distortion of facts. Why in the world didn't he just make the story fiction???? We all know that much fiction is based on actual facts. The author has destroyed his own book. I wouldn't buy it. There are many other good books in the same genre. Please don't support author's that lie! Google the title if you want more info. 60 minutes did a story on him...it's hard to dispute.
5,You must read this book!!!,"Being in grad school, I dont read many books anymore and when I do it usually takes me about 6 months to get through one. Not this book, I could not put it down! The book is educational, inspiring, and makes you feel like a better person for reading it. I am going to give it to all my friends, it puts a new, humanistic light on current events and everyone should hear this perspective."
1,This book shattered my enthusiasm,"I looked forward to getting this book. I read studiously and with great hope that I would get into the ""peacemaking"" theme. I struggled to 'get it' and tried to enjoy it. It was so poorly organized that I wanted to skip the descriptions and names of people and places that didn't mean a thing to me. Finally, somewhere after the 'centerfold pictures', I gave up. This didn't give me any idea where his real money came from. How could he afford all this travel while tring to find 'backers' and resources? This was a great vocation but didn't share any of the real feelings the man experienced. I think he would have done better if he wrote his own story. This book didn't motivate me at all; and that's what I was looking for. I returned the book to the library gratefully; and I am not sorry I didn't finish it."
1,Terrible Read,"This was such a terrible book to get through due to the fact that it not only read horribly, but Mortenson's behaviors were often naive and self absorbed. It makes no sense to me why he is going this alone (at least that is how it plays out in the book) and why there isn't an effort to build a greater coalition rather than a one-man show."
2,A let down,"Given all the hype, I was really hoping to be blown away by this non-fiction read. It just didn't live up to my expectations and I was rather bored by it. I was hoping to learn more about other nations and how education differed there, but somehow the book just didn't live up to it."
1,"GREAT BOOK, BUT.... GREAT FREAKING LIES!","I read this book years ago and loved it. It's funny because At least Kite Runner's author claimed that it was purely fictional. So, now it is not much different than the book Million Pieces. You either accept the lies and still praise the book. Or, just bash it for lying.The reason I bash it is this scumbag took money from people and lied about putting that money for building in Afghanistan. Although I agree we could use the money in the U.S., that's still extremely disappointing. It has another Ponzi Scheme feel to it."
1,Patronizing Narrator,"Am I the only reader who got just beyond 50%--Kindle readers go by percentages, not pages--and had had enough of Greg Mortenson writing in third person. I saw Mr. Mortenson on Bill Moyer's Journal and was so impressed with him. But this book is so patronizing and so self-grandizing. It is as bloated as apparently his body became. It led me to three glasses of booze!"
5,required reading,"Read this, No God But God, and Reading Lolita in Tehran and you pretty much know what you need to know. Educating young people, especially young women is the only path to lasting peace. Education is cheap. Ignorance is expensive. And deadly."
3,"Incredible story, shameful writing","With a story this incredible, it's surprising they couldn't find (or afford?) a higher-quality author to tell it. I couldn't even finish the book for the annoyance of the bad writing, so instead I read interviews and snippets off websites describing the work Greg et al. have done. I've found that venue more interesting and real than trying to plough through 200+ pages of poorly written sludge. It's shameful the writing doesn't live up to the work done by Greg and the CAI."
5,Many Reasons to Read This Book,"There are so many reasons to read this book: the easeful informative relevancy (Pakistan, Taliban, Muslim lifestyles, women's rights); the inspiration and joy of learning about what just one person can accomplish for the good of many, with just how it was that he did that; and the humor and kindness that is to be encountered throughout the book, both in David Oliver Relin's page-turning presentation and in Greg Mortenson's personality and adventurous failures and successes. The book also shows what it is to effectively, in fact beautifully, interact with people as a Westerner in the Muslim world. All of these aspects together provide a hugely welcome gift of positivity amidst the usual hopeless negativity that is available in most of what we read about troubles in the world today. There is good reason that this book has been so long on bestseller lists."
1,Once it came out that Greg Mortenson is a fraud... no thank you to anything he claims,How can you tell what's true and what isn't? It's like trying to learn from -- let alone praising -- Lance Armstrong for what he did.
4,Three Cups of Tea,"At a time in our world when peace seems hopeless, this book about Greg Mortenson's efforts to connect with local people and villages and help them better the lives of their children is very heartening. This is not a book that will keep you awake at night because of its fast-moving pace. But this is a book you will want to finish because it is so full of hope. This book gives a human face to those people across the globe from us who are so close to what we consider the world of terrorism. We meet people of another culture one at a time, and because of that we see them as real people. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a positive experience and wants to believe that there is still good in the world. It is a book for all ages."
5,Waht a remarkable book,"The author has set aside all of the prejudices and presuppositions that often control any look at the Islamic world and has written an amazing account of how a person who pays attention to a culture's values, instead of trying to foist one's own values upon that society, can make a positive difference. Compelling, well written, and insightful."
4,Inspiring Story but Difficult Read,"Four stars for the inspiring story, but I wish that Greg Mortenson had written this book himself. While an inspiring and touching story, I think that David Relin just made it difficult to get through. The use of Greg's full name throughout the book makes you want to run for your word processor and do a global search and replace. You find yourself thinking, ""We know what his name is by now"". I caught myself looking ahead a few times to see how many more pages I needed to get through, just because of the writing style.The parts of the story where Greg relates something firsthand are great, it's a shame that the entire book wasn't written that way."
1,American bashing,"I had to buy this book for my son's honor'sEnglish class. I usually read what my children have to read so we can discuss it ahead of time. I read political books, autobiographies, the classics, etc. so I am not dense, but this book is horribly difficult to get through. It is boring, they use so many muslim (baltic) words without definitions, they bash America and prop up the muslims and their culture. It is awful!!! I have asked several other parents and they are all in agreement. I can't imagine why any teacher would want this thing to be read by her students. I understand that we need to be able to have a better understanding of the people of these regions and I think that Greg Mortenson is wonderful and what he did is very commendable. However, if Americans are so terrible, how did he manage to find so many to help him with this project?"
5,"What I Learned From ""Three Cups of Tea""","What I learned from ""Three Cups of Tea"" was very simple: if you want to help win the war on al Qaeda, contribute as much as you can to the Central Asia Institute (https://www.ikat.org/). The key to any counter-insurgency is to gain the support of the people (see http://alglobus.net/politics/FieldManual.html) and nobody is doing more of that with less than Greg Mortenson's organization."
5,Three Cups of Tea - book review,Three Cups of Tea is an amazing story about a man to is truly making a difference in the lives of many people. This is a book that everyone should read.
1,Sooooooo borrriiinnnggg!!!!!,I couldn't make it past pg 26. They could have made it a little more interesting you know!
2,"Another Westener ""Saves the World"" and Goes Home","If I see another article or story about a Westener or European who goes over for a limited time to a ""struggling country"" of one that their country has destroyed and then returns to all of the advantages of his home but thinks that he or she has or is ""billed"" as having ""saved the world of these poor, poor people,"" I will be sick.And here we go. A whole book."
3,labored style,"No one can dispute the fact that Mortensen`s accomplishment and humanitarianism are outstanding. The book itself, in my opinion, is not. It suffers greatly from a heavy and self-conscious style (eg. ""The stars pin-pointed the dark fabric of the night..."") and from laborious detail. I give Mortensen 5 of those pin-points, the book only 3."
5,Inspiring,"I found Three Cups of Tea inspiring. I do so wish more people in the world cared about children and education. They were hungry for education and so many people in America are not. I don't know why. In New Mexico, statistics have just reported a statewide average of 50% high school graduation rate. In the 60 years I lived in New England, it was much higher and education was much more valued among all economic classes."
2,NOT my cup of tea!,"Sorry, not my cup of tea! I know, horrible metaphor, but very appropriate. I don't like the writing. The story itself is very intriguing, but the pace and the way it is told is boring. It could be exciting, but sadly, it is not."
5,A great lesson in persistence,"Greg Mortenson was a poor climber retreating from K2 when he promised a village in Pakistan that he would build a school for them. His story portrays a will to succeed against incredible odds and demonstrates what great tasks can be accomplished with the right attitude. The politics, customs, and business ethics of Pakistan are very different from those in the US, and Greg started his task without a penny of financing. But, his diligence allowed him to succeed in grand style. He has completed not one, but dozens of schools in rural Pakistan, and has created a large organization which is spreading good American will where it is desperately needed. The book is not written by Greg, but by a journalist who has spent many hours interviewing him. The writing style is not the best, but the intense plots that Greg jumps into, and his incredible determination make this one of my favorite books. Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"
2,Inspiring yet painfully written,"I'll keep this short and to the point. Yes, this is a great story and worth reading. The only problem with this book is the main source for my discontent: it is very poorly written. The prose seems out of place, the background on small characters is frustrating and the author's sophomoric style (and word choice) is seemingly frustrating throughout. It was painful to finish this book and yet, somehow worth it."
2,interesting topic but BORING book,"Compelling read because you want to know what happens (sort of), but it reads like a sales pitch for the organization. Would've worked as a magazine article, but whew! this book is about 200 pages too long. Glad to know Mr. Mortenson did the things he did, very admirable work (except for the part about leaving his own family for months at a time, and his exceedingly poor organizational and time-management skills), happy I read the book if for nothing more than an increased understanding of the region. Read it for a book group and we all agreed (those who finished it, anyway) that we had to force ourselves through to the end of the book."
5,Canididate for Nobel Peace Prize,"This book is such a delight and pleaure to read. Greg Mortensen has accomplished so much in providing thousands of children in Pakistan/Afganistan an education. He has helped to build schools that provide hope and a future to these children who have lived under such harsh circumstances. America should be so proud of Greg and his accomplishments. To me,it is a tragedy for someone like Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize when his efforts no where come close to Greg Mortensen's deeds and accomplishments. Every American should read this book and realize there are people like Greg who is unselfish and making the world a better place for children and peace."
1,Unreadable,"While I admire and respect Mortensen (sp?) for what he did, this book is 350-pages of minutia of events, without a bit of insight into the people.Mortensen want to work on the school, but no! A tribe three or seven hours away has asked him over for a feast. He can't leave, but he must, so he treks in an old jeep to . . .That's the story, detailing what he drank, what he wore, the grit and dirt on the road, but we never get inside the man. This would have been an astounding magazine article of 10 pages or so. But 350? Egads, no. For something infinitely more readable, and insightful, and as inspiring, read Tracy Kidder's book on Paul Farmer."
1,"Great story - writing style is choppy, painful to read","While the story itself is interesting and the cause extremely important, the writing is painful! It's choppy, disjointed and poorly written. I regretted taking this book on my vacation and felt that after I read it, I didn't learn that much more about his story (I had already read a number of reviews, etc). I can't understand why more than 1,600 people on Amazon rated this book 4+ stars. I would rarely take the time to write a review but in this case, I felt that I must! Please don't bother - it a frustrating book to read because the quality of writing is so poor."
5,Awinspiring,Greg Mortenson is a Hero. He proofs over and over again that one person can make a difference. The book is very well written and it is difficult to put it down. I highly recommend it.
2,"Think green, and save a tree!","Without recounting the whole 338 pages, this book is basically about a man who was the son of missionaries in Africa who didn't decide to lead a productive life until his mid-thirties. The voice of the book jumps between a first and third-person narration, ""stories"" are interspersed with exagerated travelogue, and personal politics are interjected which are irrelevant to the message Mortenson claims he wants to bring to the world. Does the author really believe the public will buy the baloney that he is privy to presidential phone call information? Anyone who is thinking of reading this book should wait until one is passed along to them as there certainly are a lot of gifts floating around.PS -- To anyone reading this review, don't be surprised to find an inordinate amount of ""no help"" ratings. The Greg-Groupies apparently work 24/7 to discredit anyone who doesn't agree with them."
2,A disappointing story....,"This book did cover the seriousness of mountain climbing, politics and religious sects in that part of the world, plus the trials and tribulations of school construction in volatile lands. However, half-way thru the book I started wondering when his wife and 2 children would enter the picture as part of Greg's life. Never happened. He did give his wife, Tara, a small paragraph of praise in ""Acknowledgements"". Came to the conclusion that his ego has to be larger than a house. His 10 year commitment, while doing good, at the expense of his family. The story tells of brief and sporadic visits to his home in Bozeman and, and while there, he's barricaded in his basement doing what's important! His self-willed day-to-day is pretty much over-the-top for a so called ""humanitarian"". I found myself getting irritated by the down-played grandiosity.I hope the school's are doing great things for women."
5,"Three Cups of Tea, One Man's Mission to Promote Peace","If one would like to read an eye opening, true story that is extremely interesting, inspirational and beautifully written, then Three Cups of Tea is your ""cup of tea"". The hero is Greg Mortenson and by virtue of his wife, Tara's unrelenting sacrifices, she is too.The author is David Oliver Relin, a winner of more than forty national awards for his writing and editing. The book came to us second hand, after being read by several others and it is on the way to more readers. The volume of readers is truly under represented even though it is the N.Y. Times #1 Bestseller. It is a book that you will pass along and maybe hopefully be inspired.Claire Haynsworth"
4,A SYMPATHETIC (IF OVERWRITTEN) DESCRIPTION OF IMPOVERISHED PAKISTANIS,"My reading of the Koran a year ago did not diminish my fear of and prejudice against Islam. But this book showed me countless examples of peaceful and loving Muslims and in doing so built for me a very believable bridge to a more trusting and hopeful view. For this reason alone, I count the time reading Three Cups of Tea well spent.I agree with the many reviewers who wrote that the book is overwritten. (My own personal gripe is the writer's use of the word ""snuck."") But I strongly disagree with several rather narrow criticisms of Mortenson himself. True, ""Dr. Greg"" is not like most of us; but, good lord, give the man credit for outstanding achievement in the face of incredible odds.Personal eccentricity is often found in men and women who achieve great things: Ghandi, Jesus, Siddartha, Moses, Lincoln. Give the guy a break!"
5,"brooklynstar* L.I. New York, US","Love this book... Greg Mortenson""s amazing story is captivating. This story is a proof that one person can make a difference. His determination to make a difference in the lives of children that live in the most unfortunate parts of the world is huge. And he did it. Nothing stopped him. I highly recomend this book. He is a modern day hero, hands down."
4,A Book Every American Should Read,"What this book lacks in literary value, it more than makes up for in the incredibly important message that it conveys. This book shows how one man can change more of Pakistan that the rest of the worlds' governments. It has a wonderful message about tolerance, peace, and the dedication of one man who has decided to DO something wonderful. This book will change how you think about ""Muslims"", the ineffective governments who claim they are helping in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and will inspire you with the accomplishments of one man on a mission."
2,"Good Cause, Bad Representation","I have read this book, and I must admit that the cause is indeed helpful, although it would be nice to focus on both girls and boys to address the problem of gender inequality.What I did not like is the the overall representation of Pakistanis as well as the writing involved. The writing reminds me of Edward Said's Orientalism. The exotic ""other"" in the perception and presence of the ""American"" is bothering. It has the typical colonial framework all over. I suggest that one re-read the book and keep this idea in mind. The book was mainly written for the American audience, after all."
5,Uplifting journal,"It is wonderful to see that one person ,determined and dedicated, can make a difference."
3,"Great story, but....","This beautiful story of compassion and commitment will inspire all but those with hearts of stone. Read it, listen to it or listen to others talk about it and you'll understand that Mortenson's mission is one which we all should endeavor to join. How unfortunate though, that the authors could not withhold their political proselytzing and just tell us the unblemished story. Instead, the reader is forced to navigate a propaganda minefield which should be posted with the political warning: Che Guevara good, George Bush bad. What a damper that puts on the readers' mood."
1,So tragic.,"I wish this book were true, but it is not. It is, at best, a gross exaggeration, and at worst, an outright fraud. Please go buy Three Cups of Deceit (available on Kindle for $3) and find out the truth... or just spend a bit of time googling.I wish, I wish, I wish that this book were true."
2,Why not everyone can be a writer.,"One of the most poorly written pieces of crap I've ever tried to read. The book lacks chronology, a coherent narrator, and flip flops between unorganized interviews and shaky third party accounts. The only redeemable aspect of the book was the story it attempted to tell, which has now been implicated to be falsified."
1,Greg is a con artiste?,"This book has been revealed to have invented stories, including the first story about K2. 60 minutes recently had a damning expose that Greg's stories are fabricated and his charity is used to enrich himself. Google 'Three cups of tea 60 minutes' to see the episode. As someone who works in Afghanistan and puts his butt on the line there, I find this reprehensible. The publisher needs to issue refunds to people who bought this book."
1,This book is a work of fiction!,"According to a story broadcast April 17, 2011 on ""60 Minutes,"" this book is NOT a true story. It is full of lies and exaggerations."
1,Liar Liar Pants On Fire,"Why read a book that is based on lies...too many good people doing too many good things to support this..Burn the book, get off the couch and go volunteer somewhere..."
1,Three cups of bull,"60 minutes just took this guy down for the fraud that he is. He made up the stories, made up being kidnapped by the Taliban, and it sounds like he border-line embezzled from his charity."
1,Build a Jail,Perhaps Mortenson should build a jail for himself and all the other liars of his ilk who take millions from honest people for essentially a one man charity.
5,Nobel Peace Prize candidate!,"I just finished reading ""Three Cups of Tea"", an incredible story about Greg Mortenson who was befriended and cared for by the people of Korphe after getting lost in their village upon an attempt on K2. He promised them that one day he would return and build a school for them. This simple promise would change his life forever and thousands of illiterate boys and girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. After 9/11 this volatile region would change but not Greg's mission. He won the hearts of Taliban, fierce Wazirstan fighters and mullahs throughout the region. The war on terror can not be won simply by dropping bombs and letting Allah sort them out. Education is the only way to change ignorance. This man's determination, foresight and unwaverable commitmment is doing more diplomacy then that whole gang in DC. Incredible story, heartwarming, makes you feel proud of our country again when one man can make such a difference."
2,Great story - unimpressive sophomoric writing,"I loved reading the story of how one organization/person is initiating change in a part of the world that sorely needs help. But, I had a hard time getting past the writing. Who was responsible for the number of times flight attendants on airplanes were referred to as ""stewardesses?"" Who calls them this anymore? People who are working for the betterment of women in this world? I think not.And I swear, one time the author used the word turd, to describe human waste left on the mountain. Unbelievably juvenile!I would imagine the subject of this inspiring story was simply too busy to properly review this book. And I would also hold any (was there?) editors responsible."
5,Not enough *stars* to rate this book...,This should be required reading for everyone in the US. It not only promotes peace but it brings understanding and draws the poison of hate from the social body.
1,"One Cup To Go, Please","I have two problems with this book. Reading it makes me feel like I'm stuck in the seat behind someone very tall in the movie theater. I have trouble, first, getting past the writer and his perceptions of Greg and second, getting to know Greg himself. Like a speaker introducing the guest - I just want to hear Greg tell the story but he only speaks every once in awhile. Like most male authors, the motivations, feelings, emotions etc. are ignored. For example, there's no reaction of Greg's after he gets a garbage can dumped on his head in high school? Wouldn't this have been a good time to have Greg say he missed Africa and vowed to go back someday or something? It feels like there are two people in this book you are asked to get involved with and there should only be one: Greg."
1,T for Tedious,"This book is a hagiography of an admittedly saint-like fellow, Greg Mortensen, who -- like most saints -- is a pain in the butt. He is tenacious and uncompromising, clever, curious (learning a great deal about the peoples and languages in Pakistan and Afghanistan), dedicated, and has no sense of humor or irony. A mountain climber who sleeps in his car and works part-time, Mortensen -- after getting lost in the Himalayas -- vows to return to the Pakistani villagers who saved his life and build them a school. Doing this all by himself, as opposed to, for example, working thru UNICEF or Habitat for Humanity, Mortensen runs into predictable snafus. His biographer never met an adjective he didn't like, and gives backstory on every character who wanders across the screen. I finally started reading only the first sentence of each paragraph, and found the book much more coherent that way. It's a long shapeless story."
3,Three Cups of Yawn....,"I desperately wanted to enjoy this book. But I personally found it to be incredible dry, dull, and somewhat boring. I actually had to stop reading this book, something I NEVER do. I know this is a non-fiction book, but I suppose I thought there would have been some adventure, some intrigue, and maybe even an encounter with a terrorist or something. That's my fault and I only blame myself. However, what this man did was incredibly admirable. His dedication to his goal was inspiring and I think on some levels it really shows a person how much willingness another human being has when he/she puts their mind to something.Bravo to Greg Mortenson for his service to our world."
5,Inspiring and an eye-opener,This book has changed the way I see the world and the future. I am inspired by Mortenson's call to action and his courage. If more people were willing to get involved even in their local communities the world would definitely be better and safer.We cannot ignore the madrasa problem. Education is power and sometimes education is dangerous when the agenda and curriculum are centered on brainwashing. Undoing the damage of this misguidance will be our order of business for the next several generations.
5,the passionate education,"in sharing his passion to provide educational opportunity for the children of pakistan and afghanistan, greg educates us about the reality of day to day life in these countries....both the good and bad moments. his persistence and courage are commendable as is his creativity in solving problems outside the framework of red tape and naysayers. it is all and all a good read!"
3,a secular-based approach to charity,"Somewhat interesting and educational. I applaud Mortenson for his efforts but am ambivalent regarding his dabbling in Islam. Did he need to do this (praying to Allah, etc.) in order to accomplish what he did? I don't know. Is it ok to show even a facade of accepting and respecting Islam for any reason? As a Christian, I think not. Anyway, my church's book club is discussing this in our next meeting and if it weren't for that I probably wouldn't have read it. Mortenson's heart was in the right place, I believe, but I honestly can't understand why this book is the phenomenon that it is. In my opinion, highly overrated."
4,Three Cups of Tea,enjoyed the details of how Mortenson was involved in the mountain climbing aspect and how he learned to deal with different cultures. How true it is that we share so many of the same traits worldwide.
5,inspiring...,"The word inspiring sums up this book in a way. Like it is noted in the book, it proves to us that one person really can make a huge difference and makes us wonder why there are not more of us trying to make a difference."
5,Three Cups of Tea: One man's mission to promote peace...One school at a time,"An excellent book about one man's dedication to people who have a great need for education, especially for the girls and women of these countries.I agree with Mary Bono, he is a deffiniterly a hero. We support his work with a monthly donation."
5,A Book to Give to Friends,"A story of one man's achievments in the third world. And proof that one person can make a difference. It may not be the best written book you will pick up, but the story will hold your interest to the end. We have bought and given to friends and relatives. A story that needs to be told."
5,Finding another world,"Lost and injured, a man whose world was the tops of mountains found another kind of world farther down the mountain. Threatened by death in the high altitudes of K-2, he wanders into a settlement of indigenous people. Across language barriers human kindness wraps him in care and eventually health.In this strange world he finds his soul and has given the rest of his life to building schools for their children as a way of giving back to the future of those who loved him back to life. A different kind of war in Afghanistan."
5,A book every American should read,An excellent story and very well written. It is particularly timely today given what is going on in that part of the world. It certainly gives much to think about. I would recommend this to everyone I know.
4,A different perspective,"Greg Mortenson is an extraordinary man, I believe, who was called to help the Pakistani people. What a kind and good heart and he had a wife who was an angel sent from God.To get an American's inside perspective on Pakistan was also very enlightening for me as an American who gets too much distorted information on television and the news.A Wonderful and Inspiring book."
5,Best book of the year,"I read all the time, whenever I have a 10 minute window. This is my book of the year. Like many Americans, I have felt helplessness over the suffering created by the wars in Afghanistan and now Iraq. This is a book which *proves* there is hope for change. That these are real people that we can help immediately, in a way that will change and improve their daily lives. Greg Mortensen is a saint in the ancient sense of the word. Someone who has the raw ability and power to do what the rest of us only dream of. I am sending a large donation to CAI and will follow the progress of the schools via their website. Because as a suburban mom, I can't jump on a plane to Pakistan or Afghanistan and make positive change happen. But I can support Greg and his teams and the theme from the book, is that ""One person can make a difference"", even a suburban mom."
5,Inspiring story of a modern day reluctant hero,"This is an inspiring tale of courage, determination, and humanity at its best. I couldn't put the book down, as I followed Mortenson on his journey to build schools for children living in one of the world's most uninhabitable areas. Mortenson's sheer determination, and humility, get him through some life and death situations. He is a true modern day hero; but there are also all the unsung heroes which he credits with helping him along the way, like his wife, thr tribal elders he encounters, fixers, benefactors... he made sure to leave no one out in giving thanks for the support that helped him to move mountains. Truly incredible work they have done in Pakistan and Afghanistan"
4,Fascinating story,A revealing look at how one man (or woman) can make a difference through perseverance and focus. Also a revealing look at Pakistani and Afghan societies through a different lense than the politico military one we normally see through.
4,Do you yearn for peace?,"Read Three Cups of Tea and learn how you can work for peace. This story showcases what a single person with a dream can accomplish. Yes, Mortenson knows that when you give, you also receive. The desire to lessen suffering in the world motivates him so strongly that he does what military intervention has failed to do. He shows Muslim children another, kinder Western face. And he procedes one step at a time, often working blindly, unsure of the next step or where support will come from, but always rooted in determination and confidence that the dream of schools for children is possible. This is the way Mother Theresa worked. Mortenson's book educates us in a way that news reports don't. It makes the people behind the news real. Everyone wondering about what our nation should do to promote peace should read this book."
5,Three cups of Tea,"I read Three cups of Tea by Greg Mortensen this past summer. Then in September I went on a vacation and while there talked with my sister and aunt about the book. They had not read it so I ordered two books to be sent to them because I wanted to share this wonderful book. I believe Greg Mortensen is doing a wonderful service to the world--he is living what he believes is right. And I cringed when I was reading about Greg riding on top of the building materials on top of the swaying truck that was traveling up that winding side of the mountain, 200 feet over the river. What steadfast faith he has."
4,Great book,"Great book. It was well written, enjoyable to read. By the time I finished I had a greater understanding of what is going on in that part of the world, and also a greater understanding of why a strictly military effort is doomed to fail. I wish it was required reading for all of the US government leaders. Greg Mortenson is an amazing guy. When you see all that he and his group accomplished it is amazing. Makes you want to cry when you realize how our government screwed things up so badly."
4,"Eye-opening, Inspirational","In spite of my geograpical illiteracy, the book was so readable and fascinating. Eye-opening to world situations and how ""teaching the child how to fish"" is or can be so much more beneficial than just ""catching fish""... Makes me inspect my own heart and reflect upon what I am doing to help those in need...and as a teacher, renews my zeal for the importance of education."
4,Education is the Way to Peace,Greg Mortenson's true climb to greatness was discovering that an education is the seed ground for peace. His enduring faithfulness to his mission transformed the world one child at a time. As a Franciscan Sister of Christian Charity I was schooled to become a teacher. I look forward to reading historical accounts of these schools by the students themselves.
3,"Inspiring Story, Not So Well-Written","Greg Mortenson is certainly an inspiring figure, having committed his life to building schools for impoverished villages in Pakistan. If you want a positive story about someone making a true difference in the world, this is it. Two things bothered me though, and detracted from what could have been a five-star book:1) I found myself distracted by some of Mortenson's life choices. He ditches his own wife and kids and puts himself, unnecessarily in some cases, in very dangerous situations. This made him a slightly less compelling figure to me. 2) The writing style of the co-author is so poor that it really damages an otherwise fine story. The language is flat and uncompelling, and Mortenson's personal story deserves so much better. Still, a book well worth reading."
5,A Must Read,"This may be the most important book of the decade. It is much more than a readable, true adventure story of mountain climbing and survival. It demonstrates the power of one individual to change lives and by changing lives, change the world. It should be read by every adult, discussed by every book club and encourage donations to educational efforts around the world."
2,Three Cups of Tea,I thought Penguin Books was a large publishing company that could afford decent editors. Whoever edited this book obviously hasn't grasped the usage of the comma in the English language--among other things.Too bad poor writing took away from an otherwise good story.
1,Waste of Time,"I really wanted to like this book but was completely put off by how overly dramatic the author tried to be and by how much of the book was spent in portraying how great he was for doing this. I don't understand how this has gotten so many good reviews. We all should be helping those less fortunate than us but don't waste your time or your money on this book. If you want to help, I'd suggest sending what you would have spent on this book to a local charity - a much better use of your time and money."
5,The BEST book I ever read,"I have never read a book that by the end of it I have told every single person I know that they MUST read it. It's an amazing story of sacrifice, strength, faith and determination. It shows you in many ways that a person can accomplish so much and that sometimes lifes setbacks can lead to tremendous successes. It's a beautiful story that will capture you from the first word to the last. A must read!"
5,"Inspiring, educational, and easy to read- give it a try!","I received this book as a gift, and probably never would have bought it for myself, but I am so glad I read it. I learned more about the real people of Pakistan and Afghanistan from this book than any history book, and more about the conflict in the area than all the news coverage in the past 7 years. It's an easy read, and very inspiring- One person can really make a difference in this world. Greg Mortensen has done more to decrease terrorism coming out of that part of the world than any military action could. I highly recommend this book!"
1,Rancid Tea,"I gave up on page 86. I found the book impenetrable and unreadable. Turgid, overwrought, ridiculously florid, with monotonous and excessive references to Mortenson by name instead of in the third person and -- this is unforgivably rude to the reader -- overly reliant on obscure foreign words and phrases that are nowhere defined. I'm sure Mortenson's story is well worth telling. Hopefully, a competent author will tell it someday."
5,Story about people who are forgotten...,"Story about people who are forgotten or often overlooked in the ""fight against terror"". This book outlines the deep inner most desires of most decent people, things that we only hope to do in our entire life is done by Greg Mortenson in such a short period of time.I wish only 1% of people in the world could follow his path this world would be a much better place.Shak"
2,Story...fine. Style...? Not so much.,"I found this book very hard to read. It's written like a newspaper article, which gets annoying after the first chapter.I would have given this book one star, but the story is sufficiently inspiring to slightly offset the negative effects of the style it's written in. I definetly do not reccomend this book for buying. If you must, look it up on wikipedia to find out what happens in it, but don't waste time and money on it otherwise."
3,"Terribly written, but interesting story","Although the book tells an interesting story, the writing is so overwrought and overblown that it made for a tough read."
2,Alas... Boring,"I am one of those lone voices that quietly has to say this book did nothing for me. My friend up the street said I wouldn't be able to put it down, but I did.The first three pages were excellent and I had great hope of a great read, but alas Mortenson grows long winded and wearisome. His details are not interesting, though they could have been given the fascinating place he was in, but instead he is boring and pedantic."
2,I'm glad I read it but ...,"I found it a little strange that Mortenson co-wrote a book that depicted him so heroically. I guess modesty isn't one of his virtues. Plus the book was poorly edited and could have been cut down by at least 100 pages.Having said that, I think this is an important, eye-opening book. Anyone who thinks they understand what's going on in Pakistan today should take a look at Mortenson's experiences. They're truly inspirational."
4,a timely read in this global community,"After reading this book, I purchased 10 more and passed them to friends upon the condition that they pass it on as well. When considering bringing destruction in another country, it would be important to be able to look the citizens of that nation in the eye. This book may be the closest any of us come to doing that in Afghanistan. It is about compassion, respect for differences, autonomy, and ultimately a passion for learning innate in all children. It is a fascinating and necessary read. Mortensen's drive is contagious."
5,Best book about fundamentalist extreamism,"Kudos to Greg Mortenson for sharing this great story. Now we have someone talking and doing what it takes to overcome ignorance and hate. Too bad no one was paying attention when we left Afghanistan and our battle with the real minds behind September 11th to invade Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with that sad day. This book shows there are many many Muslims that are reasonable and want education for their children to overcome Wahabbi fundamentalists and extreamists. A great read. Thanks Greg."
5,A message not to be ignored.,"This book should be required reading for those who have forgotten the meaning of serving your fellow man. It is easy to read and the reasons behind this one man's mission are easily understood. The author titles one of the chapters ""The enemy is ignorance"". To read this book is to acquaint yourself with the basic oneness of all of our peoples in the desire for the peace and well-being of everyone. Who knew that one man could still make a difference in this world."
5,One person really can change the world,"Fantastic book - full of hope, but not in a smarmy, saccharine way. It does indeed show that one person's efforts can have significant repercussions - in a positive way."
5,Three Cups of Teas by Greg Mortenson,"This book should be read by every American who has ever thought that Muslims are horrible people, felt fear after 9/11 and worried about our future....that is to say, probably everyone. What this incredible man, Greg Mortenson, has accomplished through building schools for girls, encouraging education to enlighten future generations in northern Pakistan so they will understand that we Americans are not the enemy they're led to believe we are. Read the book..feel the positive feelings at the end and get out your checkbook...it is astounding to find out what amazing good can be done for one little dollar sent to his foundation, the Central Asia Institute in Bozeman, Montana."
5,three cups of Tea,"As I read this book my first thought is why isn't there more publicity about what he is doing?? It is so simple and in a part of the world where Americans are mistrusted , he has made a difference. If you can read this book and NOT want to do something positive it is surprising. The suggestions at the end of the book include writing a review, so I did.I recommend it to anyone who is concerned about peace and improving the lot of children in far off nations."
4,"Great story, not especially well written.","This book is needless to say touching. It shows one man's impact on an entire community. Your everyday man, striving to make a difference in people's lives.I feel this story could have been better written however. The prose does not shine as brightly as the morals of the main character.Definitely worth the read."
4,You don't need my review to know that it is a bestseller,"By now, you already know everything there is to know about this one. But it was a good read. And the guy might be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize (as of the date I'm posting this). Amazing what one man can do."
5,Timely,This story provides much needed insight to the central Asian world. Greg Mortenson is a true hero for all humankind.
2,Noble Cause. Terrible writing.,"With all the interest in the subject of this book and my interest in global efforts to help severely disadvantage populations, I thought it was a book I'd really enjoy reading. While I greatly admire Greg Mortenson and the good work he is doing the story bogs down in so much arcane detail and just plain bad writing that half way through I decided I'd had enough. I give 0 stars to the writer and five to Greg Mortenson and the Central Asia Institute.Update: I wouldn't recommend reading a book promoted as non fiction and is fiction. Following the recent news about the false stories in this book and my reading of Three Cups of Deceit by Jon Kraukauer I would not give Greg the five stars. He's done a lot of good but i'm terribly disappointed in his misrepresentations in this book."
4,An important book...,"Slow-going at times, I was glad I persevered. It's an important book that teaches you a lot about Pakistan and Afghanistan, its culture and its people."
5,The truth about the way to peace,"This is an amazing book that will open your eyes to the necessity of patience where the goal is to create trust and understanding. I have bought over ten copies of this book for friends and colleagues, and I have asked each one of them to keep the book moving so that the information inside may be shared with as many people as possible."
4,Great Book. Still a very timely topic.,"Given this week's Time Magazine cover story of an Afghan woman with her nose cut off and the decisions the US must make over the next year about its continued presence in Afghanistan, this book continues to be highly relevant."
3,"Another ""do gooder"" book","I found this book to be a very interesting in many ways. It gives cultural insights into the common lives of Moslem people which I enjoyed. I feel that his argument for building schools is on a humanitarian level very noble. However it paints a picture of success that I think belies the facts. He did mention the two fatwahs passed gainst him and how he over came them. His thirty some schools are nothing in comparison to the thousands of Madrassahs that train Jihadists. But sincerety and kindness and just ""talk to them and ask them what they want "" may work on a village level but the rulers of Iran, Saudia Arabia and Russia are on a different level. They want Israel and America annialated. And they are the decision makers not the people in the villages. His philosophy is so idealisstic that it is not practictal for long term policy,. I doubt if any of the schools will be still in existance is a few years."
4,Saturated with Tea in Pakistan,"Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin have combined to write a challenging book. It is about Mortenson and his love for the people, particularly the children, of Pakistan. Mortenson gained much of his early reputation as a skilled mountain climber, but when he was desperate for help it was a group of tribal people who rescued and nurtured him back to health. In return, Mortenson promised to build the people a school and eventually he formed his own charity and built many schools. The book should challenge and encourage Americans to not see all Muslims as terrorists, nor all humanitarians as Christians. Mortenson is a self-described 'infidel' who pursues his vision of bringing education to girls (emphasized in the book) and boys in very rural areas of Pakistan. The book is rich in cultural detail and intrigue and should be read by all American NGO and military personnel."
5,Three Cups of Tea,"I LOVED this book! Whether you are philanthropic-minded, an educator, adventure traveler, trying to figure out the solution to the middle-east crisis or love reading thriller novels, you will love reading this book too. This should be mandatory reading in our schools and the Pentagon!"
3,Okay story...,"This books was highly recommended so I took a chance. The story was told well, and the writer gave you a good picture of who he was. My only problem was I thought the book went on too long. After several schools were built, I felt the book was over - and so I then got a little bored. But overall, not a bad read. Just not one of my highest recommendations."
5,Inspiring and Educational,"I loved this book. The story is incredibly inpiring and I found it to be easy to read. Some of the reviewers have complained about the verbose writing style of the author. I can understand that criticism, as there were parts of the book that I read through quickly because I was anxious to get on with the story. But I think that is more a testament to how great the story of Mr. Mortenson's work is than anything. Overall, I didn't think the writing style detracted from the book.In addition to beimg inspirational, I found the book to be educational as well. Afghanistan and Pakistan are areas of the world we often only mention or think about in the context of terrorism. This book does a great job of highlighting what life is like for the many rual poor in those countries. It's nice to put humn faces and names to a prt of the world that seems so foreign.Highly recommended!"
5,3 C ups of Tea.,"The book, ""3 Cups of Tea"", is an excellent, uplifting, and inspiring story. Greg Mortenson , the author, is a mountain climber in India. On his last climb, he fell ill, and was taken in by a small village. They cared for him and helped him to recover.When he was well, he asked how he could re-pay them and they replied that their greatest need was for a school for the children. With great effort, he finally had a school built there. He spent the rest of his life building more schools in isolated villages in India.This a story of an unusual man, a true hero, and his passion to overcome many difficulties in order to build many schools.D. Urman"
3,Magnificent Tedium,"Roaming through the sights, sounds, smells and dangers of Pakistan, Three Cups of Tea is a timely read. It gives an intimate flavor to the complex psyche, custom, and politic of the Pakistani of today. With the backdrop of the geography and perils of mountain climbing, Mr. Mortensen's obsessive, though enviable, determination allows him to reach the peak of the impossible, building educational facilities in a society where every breath is a gift, where every destiny is predetermined. His ultimate accomplishement is for a white ""infidel"" to be welcomed and sought after.That being said, reading the book was more like an important assignment than a pleasurable experience - tedious. The form and composition as presented, was lackluster, repetitive, leaving an impression that is was written from a distance.Subject matter - four stars, writing - three stars."
5,Changing the World,One man's efforts to make a difference in the world will inspire you to reach out to those living in hardship around the world.
3,Over promises,"I'm not especially keen on leaving unfavorable reviews, but I just can't believe the success and raves this book has received. The story is filled with promise and possibility that the writer is unable to deliver. What should be moments of tension or suspense, are diffused and diminished by the author's inability to explore them.I found myself unattached to the outcomes, not caring about the characters, and generally uninterested in the book. For those reasons, it was difficult to finish. The knowledge that the book was based on a real story was the only shred that held my interest long enough to complete the disappointing writing.While the overall lesson is of value, this story could have been much better presented and could have earned the praise it has received. For me, it was a great story that is poorly told.Perhaps Hollywood can do this story the justice it deserves."
2,Harder to read than climbing a mountain!,"Skip the book, just donate to the causes! www.ikat.org and www.penniesforpeace.org. It's easier than reading this book!This book took me over a month to read! I felt like I was trudging up a mountain as I was reading! Greg Mortenson's story is great and inspiring, and he seems to have done wonderful work. As mentioned by other reviewers, Greg's story could have been told much better. There was just too much information, too many people to remember, just too much! Too much jumping around from here to there.I only read this book for my book club, and for no other reason. I admire Greg Mortenson for all of his work and stugggles to educate the poor children of Pakistan and Afghanistan. And if you read this book, you will too.Also, jeers to David Relin for the ""dig"" to Fox News in his acknowledgements! Oh come on! Cheap shot!"
5,"""The Enemy is Ignorance""","Through persistence, lots of help, and great effort, Greg Mortenson has already accomplished more than our entire military could ever accomplish. Building schools for boys and girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan is the ticket. Spreading literacy among children in these areas is perhaps the best way to fight against the madrasas - the fundamentalist schools. His book is really trying to tell us that there is another way, a better way to fight terrorism, and it isn't with missiles; it's with books. The book flows well; it's easy to read. Anybody can read it."
2,"great story, pitiful writing","I wish Greg Mortenson had come to me to write this book. I could have saved him thousands of superfluous adjectives. He is built up to be a hero for our times....perhaps he is, but David Oliver Relin's prose is so sickening and (to a fellow aspiring writer) embarrassing that the reader wishes to be done with the story ASAP. Save the money from buying the book and instead send it to Greg's charity, the Central Asia Institute, or Pennies for Peace. You can get the book free at your local public library."
5,Inspiring story,"This is a true story of a gifted man, Greg Mortenson, and the schools he is building in Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is well written and it will give you a different perspective on the people of the area.I have purchased several copies of the books for gifts, as I think this is a very worthy cause. Check out the Central Asia Institute web site ([..]) for more about this project, which is alive and well in spite of the violence in both countries."
3,"Oh, how I wish Greg Mortenson had written this book!","Oh, how I wish Greg Mortenson had written this book! I am full of admiration for Greg's strength of character and his tremendous achievements. Three Cups of Tea, written by a journalist, does not do justice to the subject matter; littered with names and places, the essence evaporates, leaving a meagre illumination."
2,Read 3 Cups of Deceipt,"When I first read 3 Cups of Tea, I loved it but now know that much of of it is fabricated.. Read Jon Krakauer's book, ""3 Cups of Deceit"" to find out the truth. Don't spend money on Mortenson's book-he just pockets the proceeds (according to Krakauer) with none of it going to help build schools."
1,pathological liar,"I always thought Mortenson's kidnapping story was far fetched, and now feel validated that my gut reaction to that part of the book was spot on. Reality is indeed stranger than fiction -- the reality being that Mortensen can and did conjure up a magnificient lie and nearly got away with it. Not only does he do a disservice to the children he supposedly wanted to enlighten, he may have thwarted the success of other current and future international foundations that help the most underserved in this world by casting doubt on what foundations actually do, thereby turning donors away."
5,Stop thinking about it and read this book NOW!,"This is one of the most amazing stories of perseverance and triumph I have ever read. I couldn't put it down until finished and then I wanted to hop the next plane to Pakistan to lend a hand. Greg Mortenson's story had a profound effect on me personally, so I thank him for sharing ""Three Cups of Tea"" with the world. If there's one thing you do this year, you MUST read this book! It's engaging and very well written, enabling the reader to travel with Greg as he struggles with in-country politics and local traditions, with the highs and lows of fundraising and with the triumphs of success ... one school at a time. This world needs more Greg Mortensons if we're ever to find peace."
5,Incredible dedication,I was prepared to not like this liberal view of how to change that part of the world but have been totally sold by this great man's dedication and sacrifice to educate the Pakkistani and Afgani children.God Bless You Greg Mortenson
2,"a story worth hearing, but...","I just finished reading this book. I was energized and inspired by such an incredible story about such a remarkable man. Moreover, the book reveals a lot about the situation in Pakistan and Afghanistan and the US's involvement with it. I think it's important for Americans to read the book for this reason, so they can see this harsh reality through Greg's eyes. What he is doing for the children of this region is promote peace is truly laudable.That said, I found the book to be very poorly written. Verbose, confusing at times, and frankly a little arrogant in its tone, this book was almost painful to read. It's really a shame that Relin did Mortensen's tale such a disservice."
4,"4 stars, only just","I felt like giving this book only 3 stars, however, given the great story that it is, i thought it deserved 4. The books only downfall was the author. I struggled to keep reading it,even by 70 pages, i was struggling to find the motivation to continue because of the over done language and sentences the author would produce. Half the time i had no clue what he was even talking about, especially when many of the terms that were used in the book were never explained. This continued to bug me throughout the book. Also, the author seemed to carry on as if he was writing about a magical mythical story about a unicorn that danced around in a paddock full of daisys in some far far away place.All in all, great story, slighty ruined by the authors over dramatisations."
2,Awful book,"Poorly written and it's not very popular with high schools for a reason. Expensive read and no online options, do not invest in this book."
4,Not just about tea,I bought this because I read a friend's copy and just had to share it around. Almost unbelievable what one man's vision could achieve despite the obstacles.If everyone read this and its sequelStones into Schools: Promoting Peace with Education in Afghanistan and Pakistanthe world would be a better place.
1,Old song....,"I have read this book, it is many things especially subjective, if you are one of those people who has the seed of ""middle east or islamists hate America/westerners, this book will feed your seed plenty,it's based on his (mis) interpretation of hot topic issues, biased and rigid thinking.Alot of people fail to realise why muslims/islamists are angry moreso than hateful,and no it's not because the hate us for our freedoms, because of foreign policy these peoples lives have been destroyed irrevocably, the soviets started the destruction, the US supplied the careless mujahiddin factions with guns and heavy artillery which they used on innocent civillians, and then once the country is all but ravaged a sick bunch of bearded men with very warped ideals, help to nail the coffin shut on the country, that would make anybody and everybody bitter and angry.FYI, Afghanistan is far east and not middle east."
1,ego-centric,"The author really likes himself way too much and the book which I'm sure could be a really interesting and enlightening story gets bogged down in the ""look how great I am"" storytelling."
2,Three Cups of Greg Mortenson,"I'm sure it's a good book, but after a few chapters I just couldn't get into it. Lost my interest. I tried, but couldn't. It seemed the author would go off on tangents in the middle of the story. One moment your in the Kush mountains then the next moment the author is telling a story of another time and place. Seemed a bit convoluted with too much details about nonsense. This not to mention the author seems a tad bit self-absorbed.I'm now finding rumors that some of this book may have been fabricated. Glad I didn't dive too deep into it."
1,A Complete Lie,What a load. Greg Mortenson is a complete pathological liar. Anyone with doubts should check out 60 Minutes on Youtube.
1,Demand refunds!!,"Thank God I never read this book, but my daughter received it as a present and I am taking it back for a refund. Everyone who bought this cup of lies should do the same."
1,how sad is the thought it is a fraud?,the story seemed so implausable and it may well be an embellished story to say the least. i hope the truth is known one day.
3,A fantastic story - that may just be too fantastic,"I was really fascinated by this book and felt that I had really been introduced to a modern day pioneer who put the welfare of others before his own and worked to establish schools - especially for girls - in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Unfortunately, the story has since been pulled apart and criticized as being unsubstantiated and fabricated and charges have been made that the author put more than a little of the funds that he raised for schools in his own pocket. That information makes his story sad and disillusioning. Pioneers and heros don't grow on trees - reader beware."
4,Delaware,Received this book 2 years ago. Book was very good and in nice condition. Two of my kids used it for book reports.
5,Very Inspirational Story,What an amazing story! Greg Mortenson has done what most of us only dream of doing. He's had a positive impact on thousands of people and created a positive impression of at least one American in a very poor country with a much different culture from our own.What a wonderful effort.Thank you
3,"Nice enough story, but poorly written","I bought this book because I was looking for something inspirational, and while it is a nice story, it is so poorly written I find it hard to recommend. It would have been interesting to see what an established writer like Jon Krakauer (Into Thin Air) would have done with it."
5,How God wants us to be.,The author takes us thru his journey to help others. I felt I was with him every step of the way.
4,A good read,"The book was an engaging read, and seemed to be realistic in the challenges and triumphs."
5,One of the Best Reads in the Past 5 Years,"Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission....is one of the best reads that I have experienced in the last five or more years....I also had the chance to meet the author and his daughter, in Cambridge, MA, during a discussion of his book and his experiences in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Africa....and, the author is even better in person!! I would recommend this book to anyone who cares about our present world and mankind....it is our only hope..."
2,"poorly written, great story","What a tragedy that such an important, enlightening, and inspiring story was written so poorly. I actually didn't get past page 15 because I just couldn't stand the run-on sentences any more. Everyone in my book club loved the book but for me, the way a book is written is just as important as the story itself, and when I have to stumble over every other sentence because it's so awkward, it ruins the experience for me."
1,Terribly deceptive,"It is an obvious temptation in retelling a story to make it more dramatic each time.If this book was a movie then it might be expected that it would have some warning like: ""inspired by a true story"". But when a book is labeled as non fiction the reader has a right to believe that the authors are presenting the best available version of the truth that they can. Not compressing events or making things up. There is really no excuse for this betrayal of the reader and the publisher and editor should take responsibility for correcting this along with the authors."
2,"Good message, terrible writing","Good message, terrible writing. I had to force myself to finish it. If everyone heard the message we would have world peace, so it is unfortunate the book is torture to read."
5,THREE CUPS OF TEA: One man's mission to promote peace...,"An amazing read! Neither political nor religious in tone, Greg Mortenson's journey in the mountainous region of Pakistan will grab your attention and open you eyes, mind and heart; basic human decency at extraordinary levels!"
3,The last page changed my view.,"I 'thought' this was a great book. I 'thought' I learned a lot about the geography and politics of this region, but now I'm not sure. The author decided to state his political opinions at the very end......which left me questioning whether I read a 'far-left' political book or one of fact. I'm sorry to say I have some negative feelings about the book and would not contribute to his fund raising."
3,Noble work but . . .,". . . what about his own kids back home? Greg Mortensen's devotion to educating children is remarkable, however, I'm not sure why he'd choose to have a family then leave them repeatedly to pursue a very personal mission. Not sure it he's selfless or selfish but I can tell you it's hard having a 'saint' for a father. No matter how important Greg's work is, it still exacts a very big toll on his relationship with his kids."
3,two cups too many,"This was on my to-read list for a long time but I just couldn't seem to pick it up. Then it became a pick for my reading club. I missed the book club meeting and still hadn't finished the book two weeks afterward. It's just the kind of story that takes you a while. One of those books where the comment ""it has a lot of words"" meets nods of understanding.While the story is quite good and morally awakening, the power of Mortenson's activism can get lostin all the descriptions. Since it's a plot you know before beginning the first chapter - Mortenson asmountain climber turned do-gooder builds schools in Pakistan, especially for girls - the narrative turnslengthy with small anecdotes that slow the progress of the reader in much the way that politics and turfwars impeded Mortenson's building; these details are important, but just get really old really quickly.Certainly a must-read for anyone wanting an emotional pick-me-up, but definitely lacks the structure of a good novel."
5,Inspirational,This is without a doubt the most inspirational book I've ever read. Don't miss the opportunity to pick up a copy & share with your friends. This would make a great gift. It's an amazing true story of the most selfless person you can imagine making a significant difference in the world.
5,Inspirational!,"This book really compells one to take action. While reading this book, I just wanted to volunteer my services to Greg Mortenson on his fight for education & understanding. Unfortunately his website makes it clear that there are so many who feel this way his organization can't be responsible for all these volunteers. Instead one is directed to other charities that are not quite the same. It's a shame that there are so many of us who want to volunteer our time or expertise yet the obstacles prevent many of us from doing so. Greg, you are one of my heroes! Keep up the good work :)"
5,Amazing!,"""Three Cups of Tea"" is not only a great adventure story, but it will change the way you think about Pakistan and the Muslim faith. It's proof that one person can make a difference. After reading this book I am excited about getting my junior high students involved a ""Pennies for Peace"" program."
2,Remarkable Story--Poorly Written,"I found myself skimming paragraphs & chapters searching for the motivation to keep trudging through to the end. In fact, the only thing that spurred me to continue was the picture on the cover. You can see the hope of the future in the eyes of these young ladies as they read their lessons.What Greg Mortensen has accomplished is a story worth telling and a lesson we can all learn from. Too bad the writing takes away so much from the incredible will & vision of this remarkable man."
2,Good deeds poorly written about,"Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a TimeI applaud Greg Mortensen for his works, but found the account of them hard to follow, poorly written, and had the feeling of propaganda. It is obvious the book was published to get readers to contribute to his good cause, but it was quite a disappointing read."
5,Great Book! Must read!,This is a true story you must read about. Purchase the book through amazons link on threecupsoftea.com and you donate 7% of the purchase price to a girls education fund in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
1,STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED purchase..,"Don't order from this source, I still have not received item in mail...will have to hope I can canel credit card purchase!!!"
4,Spellbound to the last--,"I'm proud of our adult book group for choosing this book. My husband and I listened to 3 Cups of Tea on CD. This man's resolve was exemplary. We were spellbound to the end. However, I feel this book would benefit from cutting a bit."
5,Excellent Read!,"This is an inspiring book about what one person can do to change the world. Forget every two-minute news report about what is happening in the war on terror, and read this book. The news media hasn't even given you a glimpse as to what life is like for those who live in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This book at least gives you a better idea of what is going on, and what can be done to put an end to the Taliban."
3,I really wanted to like this book...,"I reluctanly have to agree with the more negative reviews of this book. I really, really, wanted to enjoy this book, but between the style of writing and the tiny, tiny details etc., I felt like I was reading an unwanted school assignment and plodding through to get to the end. I admire Greg Mortenson and all his accomplishements. I especially admire his passion in all he did, but mostly his dealings with the people of the area he loves so much. I just wish this book had been better written."
3,Why so long?,"I appreciate Mortenson's selfless quest to make the world a better place, and Relin presents us with many reasons to admire Mortenson as a hero.At the same time, this book is too long by half. I was forced to skim. Other reviewers have disparaged Relin's poetic descriptions, but I find them amusing diversions from otherwise boring swaths of incidental material.Read the beginning and ending quarters of the book; skim the center half and pass it on to someone who needs news of some good being done in our bleak world today."
5,The underdog helping the underdogs,"This well written story is a very inspiring read for all of us who care about social justice. Here is a man unskilled for the challenges he takes on and who without any financial resources follows up on his word and starts to improve the world. The example of Mortenson takes excuses away from everyone. His adventures are touching. His commitment is complete and unwavering.With the tensions between the Muslim world and the western world, it is tempting to oversimplify our perception of the Muslim world and to see it as monolithic. Mortenson's story, well raconted, by Revlin, explains well the differences in beliefs and therefore behaviours of the various ethnies and Muslim communities he encounters and helps. The value of a promise kept is the best way to break down barriers between races and build lasting trust. We need more Mortensons and less bombs."
5,Timely delivery.,"I ordered four of these books to give as Christmas presents, with a contribution to the school-building efforts in Pakistan. They arrived in a timely fashion."
1,Very Disappointing,"This review is being changed based on the 60 Minutes segment which ran on April 17, 2011.While the book told many heart warming stories, it appears that some or many of them were not totally true."
5,Patience and Persistance,"I received this book as a gift at Christmas and it proved to be a most wonderful gift. To hear Greg's story, his persistence and skill give me great encouragement to believe that the world's problems can be solved. If we get the politicians and governments out of the way and do it person to person such miracles can be accomplished."
5,Inspiring,"I was inspired and moved deeply. Such a difference that 1 man can make. Great reading. Made me feel like doing something, anything... Greg Mortenson is really a special person."
3,This was a book group selection,From the description on the cover of this book I wasn't certain if I would like it or not. But I have found the writer's style to be very engaging. Greg Mortenson's story is amazing and the book has helped me to understand the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan much better. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone who would like a better picture of those countries.
4,Three Cups of Tea,Three Cups of Tea is a must have for every household. Shows the differences in our culture vs. the Middle East. Was very interesting to see how complex this culture is and helps define the people who live there. I felt it shed light on how others live and look at life.
5,Amazing Story. Amazing Man.,"This is an incredible book. There are times when the writing could be better - but that is totally beside the point. The story is so entirely captivating, and uplifting, you do not notice - or care about the quality of writing- which, overall, is quite good. One of the most memorable books I have read in years. A ""must read""."
4,Three Cups of Tea,This was an excellent book. My only criticism is that the story gets repetitive about his quest to build schools.
5,An inspiring story,"This book is excellent. I just bought 5 copies to give them as a Christmas present to 5 special friends. Sometimes it is hard to believe there is someone as brave, as humble and as persistent as Greg. He is a model to follow. This book rekindle the flame to continue working towards children education and being another drop in the ocean!!!!!"
4,Pour another cup of tea,"Three Cups of Tea captured me from the very first pages.....but about halfway through it seemed to be simply a self-aggrandizement... I put the book down and a couple of weeks later when I picked it up again my enthusiasm and interest returned.... The writing is, of course, journalistic, but thorough even if it was plodding at times.A good read. A wonderful story. Hope to see a 'follow-up' some day."
3,It was good..,It was a really good book until I found out that some of it isn't true.. I did enjoy the read and was really happy with this book. I was told by my English teacher that he fluffed it up a lot and a good majority of the things he said he did he actually didn't do?..
3,Almost my cup of tea but ultimately falls short,"This book can teach you much about Pakistan and the Balti, about the human spirit and dignity, and even about yourself. Furthermore it will take you a long way toward understanding a culture such as theirs, but ultimately it falls short. I cannot know whether Mortenson wanted to keep the final part of the Balti culture to himself or whether he never discovered the true hidden secret of this remote and isolated culture.Fortunately, I am here to deliver the true message the Balti people would like to deliver to the readers of this book and the world in general, that there are really 4 cups of tea.The first time you share tea with a Balti, you are a stranger...The second time you take tea, you are an honored guest...The third time you share a cup of tea, you become family...The fourth time you share a cup of tea with a Balti, you become butt buddies (whether you like it or not)"
4,"Slow start, but worth reading","I have to admit that this book was hard for me to get into. I tend to shy away from non-fiction, so reading this was a big change for me. The book was slow at times, & I wanted to give up more than once. I'm so glad that I didn't. It amazes me what Greg Mortenson has done to promote education in Pakistan & Afghanistan, especially for the girls who have not been allowed this luxury. A big change came for me after readingA Thousand Splendid Sunsby Khaled Hosseini & feeling that emotional connection with the women in Afghanistan & learning about the horribly demeaning way they were treated by many of the men & the Taliban. After finishing that book, my interest in Three Cups of Tea & the message it shared sky-rocketed, & I finished the book with a feeling of amazement & a longing to do something to help."
1,It is just a book of lies...,"Like many of you I feel taken advantage of emotionally by Greg Mortenson.I wrote to his publisher and explained why they should pull the book and review his contract with them.Someone has to stand up and do the right thing.What I find so appalling stole money from those people who needed it most, the girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Yes, he built some schools, but he took credit for other schools he did not build and he left others just as out houses with no infrastructure - Books and Teachers. He did not do what he said he was going to do, and it appears that he lied on his taxes.He not only took advantage of our emotions, but he took advantage of the children of these extremely poor countries.Shame on you Greg Mortenson."
5,Explosively Powerful,"The author, Greg Mortenson is an awesome man and in my book has achieved the level of a Ghandi in our world. If we all would take his road who knows what we could achieve in world peace. He will earn the Nobel Peace Prize for his selfless action on behalf of children. I would also like to mention his wife who is, I think, a true hero. How many women would share their husbands to further this cause? What love for him she must have. I hope that his 2 children will come to understand their Dad and his contributions to the world despite the fact that he was (is) absent from them much of the time.The book was a powerful read which was helped by the co-author, for whom the writing was not always easy. He has the ability to tell a story with white knuckle features--crispy and clearly as the wind and view from atop K2."
4,"Puts FEMA, World Bank, International Aid Agencies to shame","Greg Mortensen is so efficient with every single dollar that he should be running FEMA. Seriously, the main take away here than has not already been mentioned is that large government agencies, be they Pakistani or US (eg FEMA), pale in comparison to people like Greg when it comes to effcient use of charity dollars. He has the compassion, work ethic, and understanding of the culture in which he is operating to get the job done. No institution will ever match him on that. Which is why my charity dollars go to Mercy Corp and Heiffer Int'l, Seva, etc., and not quasi gov't agencies like the Salvation Army and Red Cross (do you know what they pay their regional directors!!$$) Keep up the great work Greg. You are on my list now."
4,Everyone needs to read this,"If you are frustrated with the current state of world affairs, particularly America's role in them, read this wonderful book. Greg Mortensen is not a Superman, just a guy willing to take personal risks to bring education to children (especially girls) in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Nevertheless, he is doing Super work, and asking for nothing more than donations to build even more schools. His work shows how we need to be in a war of ideas, not one of weapons. But this is not a preachy book - it is actually pretty exciting and very moving."
5,You've got to read this book!!!,"This is such an amazing real story. Beautifully and elegantly written.Greg's story will broaden your horizon with his great heart for people in pakistan and afganistan.In the middle of book, my reading was little bit stalled. But hang in there! Wonderful stories are ahead of you toward the end of the book.This book gave me a lot of laughs and tears in addition to knowlege about these war-torned and poor nation.I really strongly recommend reading this book. If you're looking for a good and heart-warming story, this book is yours!"
5,Definitely worth reading,"I picked up this book because I am a climber and outdoor person and came away from the reading experience with a much greater knowledge of Pakistan's people and culture as well as a renewed sense of the necessity for community and compassion in all aspects of life. Because the story is so powerful the writing style, to me, was all but insignificant. What is more important than the way the story is told is the message of true peace through compassionate action and real engagement with people. If you want to make a real difference in this world, read this book to see how Greg is doing it on a daily basis."
5,The real and lasting solution to terrorism,"Greg Mortenson's work of building schools in impoverished rural Pakistan and Afghanistan is the real answer to the war in terror. Young boys join extremist madrassas not because they dream of being suicide bombers, but because in many rural areas of Central Asia, this is the only place they can get an education. The jihadist indoctrination comes later.I read Three Cups of Tea in two days, then re-read most of it on the third day, mesmerized! Despite our limited funds, I am sending a small check to the Central Asia Institute to continue its work, and urge you to first read the book then consider doing the same!Kristen, Denver, CO"
3,too much information,"There is no doubt that Greg Mortenson is a remarkable man, and yes, he deserves to be awarded the Nobel peace prize. However, Relin's book gets bogged down in too much detail and becomes ponderous and difficult to read."
3,Three cups of evangelism,"I generally agree that Greg Mortonson's efforts towards building schools will go a lot farther than military power in mitigating terrorism. Mortonson's efforts are a worthy cause that should be supported.""Three Cups of Tea"" was often hard to follow. The book will discuss Mortenson's progress and then veers off into some meaningless biographical detail that is irrelevant to the story. This book would have been far better if Mortenson (or an editor) had done a better job in organization and chopping the book down to its essence. Additionally, this book would have been better if it focused less on being self-congratulatory and more on why schools are necessary."
2,Good man; bad writing,"You can tell it was written by a journalist, rather than a creative writer. Journalism is much better suited to short format (think newspaper); in longer format it can become tedious or boring. Despite the fact that the man who is being written about is a fantastic individual."
4,"interesting, important story","I am very glad that I read this book about Greg Mortenson's mission to build schools for boys and girls in Pakistan and Afganistan. The book was very well written, and gives the reader an inside look at a corner of the world which we mostly know from headlines. Mortenson truly is a hero, and his life is inspiring. Why not 5 stars? This books falls short by not getting inside the people in this book. Even with Mortenson, I felt that we were only allowed to see so much of him. Maybe it was a privacy thing. All the other characters are ones that I feel that I was well introduced to, but never knew well enough to make a strong connection. I cared greatly about the people as a group, but not about individuals. That made this book an interesting and important read, but not the page turner that nonfiction can sometimes be. Still, I strongly recommend this book to others."
5,Inspirational and educational,This book is both educational and inspirational. Here is a courageous man who understands the root of a drastic problem and is taking the right steps to make the world a better place.
1,60 Minutes report reveals a big scam going on.,"A 60 Minute report has revealed Greg Mortenson is running a scam of sorts and that he made up being stranded in the initial village and also was never held hostage by the Taliban as he claims. Most of the donations are going to promoting his book rather than to the schools/children in Afghanistan. And some of the schools he has built are either poorly built or sitting idle/empty. During the report it is made quite obvious that Greg has had ample opportunity to respond to the allegations, over a year that 60 Minutes has been trying to get his side of the story actually, and Greg is refusing."
5,Obedience to your Heart Song,"Above all this inspirational story tells of one mans obedience to his HeartSong;- the unique path one must travel to allow ones heart to sing fully and freely and follow wherever it may take you. Paulo Coelho described it as one's 'Personal Legend.'This is the story of Greg Mortenson's amazing journey to build schools in remote areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan.Also have to admire the courageous and generous spirit of Greg's wife, Tara Bishop, whose Heart Song may also be heard loud and clear in this remarkable story. Extraordinary!!!!Loved this book and strongly recommend it, especially as I am a teacher and also believe education is the best way to promote peace in this world and acknowledge that we are all brothers and sisters in this big human family."
5,"touching, inspiring, one of the favs","Here's a cliché phrase for you: A MUST READ.three cups of tea is an inspiring mission with a storyline. I know many will, after reading, find the urge to go do something and make a difference. It includes lots of profound lines that teach great, encouraging lessons. You almost want to finish it one sitting, but at the same time don't want it to end."
4,Inspirational,"A satisfying read. While the Taliban and simple poverty denied learning to girls in remote villages in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Greg Mortenson risked his life to promote peace and understanding in the most direct way he could: through education. Ironically, the Bush admministration was simultaneously destroying peace and understanding with its ill-conceived war in Iraq, mistreatment of prisoners and overall foreign policy.My biggest complaint with the book is not with Mortenson, but with the ghost writer. His style in this case is more hero worship than simple story telling. Even so, I still highly recommend the book for its power to give hope in a bleak time and place."
3,Came around in the end,"I didn't like this book as I read it but, despite my frustration with the quality of the writing and with Mortenson's blunders (which to an anthropologist felt even more inexcusable), I did eventually finish it and ended up being impressed - and inspired - by Mortenson's perseverence."
2,Would have worked better as a magazine article,"I have tremendous respect for what Mortenson has accomplished, but this book just has way too many tedious details to make for an absorbing read. Would have worked much better as a magazine article - long enough to describe Mortenson's achievements, but short enough to still be an interesting read. (spoiler alert!!) And when he left his pregnant wife to go to such a dangerous environment, I wanted to scream!!"
2,Ego-maniac,"The story of what Greg Mortensen did is honorable, but this book was painful to read. I actually couldn't even finish it because I was so sick of hearing about how wonderfully perfect Greg Mortensen is. The entire book went on and on about how everyone who ever met him thought he was some sort of demi-god. My husband tried to force himself to read it on a cross-country flight, but he couldn't even finish it. I am amazed that so many readers fell into the ""praise Greg Mortensen"" trap."
4,Good food for thought,"This book is good food for thought for people interested in development efforts in Central Asia. The descriptive writing style was interesting for the most part. Mortenson's story is inspirational, but does leave me with some questions about his methods of operation, which I am glad for the chance to ponder.I think this would make a great TV report or documentary."
5,Life changing.,This is a MUST read. I have done volunteer work for a while now.. but never in my life have I ever felt THIS inspired. Make all your friends read it... donate to Mortenson's cause... this book can change our future.
2,"Powerful Story, Terrible Writing","While the story told in this book is indeed powerful and an interesting look at a part of the world most of us know entirely too little about, wow is the writing weak. I could barely finish the book and I rarely fail to finish a book (I did eventually slog through it, but had to skim in parts). It is truly unfortunate that this story was written by someone who seemed to have taken his cues from bad mystery novels or Harlequin romance novels. The prose was clunky, repetitive and at times laughable (particularly in the ""romance"" scenes between Greg and his wife). There are so many good non-fictions writers writing today, both in books and magazines, that it should have been easy for the publisher to find someone whose skills were up to the scope of the story."
5,Everyone should read this!,"For a book that starts out a little slow and somewhat difficult to follow, it soon turns into a book that you can't put down. An amazing story that will touch your heart and knudge you into action."
4,"Great Story, Great Message, Poor Writing, Worse Editing","This really is an amazing story that needs to be told and a message that needs to be shared in the main-stream-media. The power of CAI's mission and Greg Mortenson's personal journey are enough to carry the poorly written and edited book through the end. The author turned a GREAT 200 page message into an often tedius 340 page history of Mr. Mortenson's personal life history and attempt at great literature while detracting from the main subject. Then to help things along, the editors flat missed several grammar, tense, and personal pronoun gaffs.I would recommend that anyone read this book, but I would also recommend that the author and publisher condense and re-edit for a second edition.By the way, the website for CAI where you can make donations is: http://www.ikat.org/. You can find it in the book if you look hard. I would sugest including this website on the front or back cover of the next edition too."
5,Incredible,"This book hit on all the things that are important in my life; mountain climbing, a spirit of adventure and doing something to help others in their life. The way that Greg put, and is putting, these things together for the betterment of mankind not only makes him a HERO in my view, but also shows what our world could be if more people had his vision."
1,Fraud,"Search for the 60 minutes interview and other articles about Greg Mortenson. He is accused of ""embellishing"" this story and using funds from his Central Asia Institute to promote and purchase copies of his own book (sending royalties back into his pocket). It is sickening not just to make up lies in the name of supposedly helping desperate people, but it is also very damaging to legitimate authors who want to write about their lives. Like James Frey he has done serious damage to anyone working on or interested in memoirs."
1,Pathetic,"The guy spent funds on himself. Ideas of book are good, too bad the guy is a phony. There are better people out their doing good work, so don't waste your money on this liar and thief."
1,Liar.,If you haven't heard this guy is a liar and is getting sued. I hope be loses everything. Military officers based their strategies on some of his principles/
5,3 cups of tea review,This book should be required reading in all the schools in the USA and Canada. I have recommedmed it and loaned it out to many friends and fortunately gotten it back.
5,Every American should read this,"Three Cups of Tea is a book about a man and his mission to build a school in the remote Pakistani village that took him in and nursed him back to health after he lost his party in a climbing expedition. But it is also a window into an area of the world where we are now experiencing some of our greatest foreign policy challenges. If only someone from the Bush administratio had read this book before 9/11 or at least before going into Iraq. How many mistakes could we have avoided, how many people could we have won over if we had only focused on the same things as Mortenson - giving them concrete hope for the future through education, a water pump, a hospital, and actually apying wages to the teachers, workers and doctors who participate. I bought four copies of this book to give as Christmas presents. It was inspiring to know that one man CAN make a difference."
5,Three cups of tea,"This book is a love affair with the author and the small villages high in the mountains of Afganistan and Pakistan. As is the case in most cases like this it is or should be non political. But those whom have the power want the credit and the thanks.Mr mortonson only wanted to give back some of the love and respect which he received. If you viewed "" Charlie Wilson's War"" you can almost sense that his actions of providing arms to the Afgans drove the Solviets out of Afganistan, but we are probably eating the bitter pill of the over flow of armements that ended up in the hands of the Taliban."
5,An amazing journey...,"This is the incredible story of one man's journey to save the world one child at a time. It is filled with the turmoil of countless defeats, as well as the unbending determination of one man to help the infinite needy in a forgotten part of the world. It is a powerful lesson of how small, nearly invisible steps can lead to big changes and profound differences in peoples lives. It is worthy reading and may change the life of the reader as well."
5,"Amazing, moving, overwhelming",Every person living should read this book. It is an incredible tribute to the tenacity of the human spirit in the face of daunting obstacles. Greg Mortensen and his family have made overwhelming personal sacrifices to address the needs of people in countries many of us have never heard of. I was moved to tears by the stunning descriptions of what he has managed to accomplish - a truly heroic legacy.
2,Disappointingly painful to read,This book is so poorly written - it's almost excruciating to read. I just don't know how so many people could endure the writing. It's a shame because it's certainly an intriguing story.
4,delevered as promised,We ordered a book online that was required reading for a college course. It was mailed promptly and received within the stated time. Good service.
5,Don't Dismiss Your Poltential,"Here is a short beautiful story of a young man's push to help build schools for girls in a country that we may have believed parents did not value their daughter's education.One story of a collection of stories. An illiterate village leader gave up one half of the village's goats to a violent tribal leader who threatens to destroy their new school if they did not give up the goats. The illiterate village leader when asked why he would give up the goats that represented half of the village's wealth, he wisely said the violent tribal leader will soon have only the bones of the goats; we will still have the school.After reading Three Cups of Tea that had been recommended to me by a friend, I purchased four adult editions for my grown daughters, and three young reader editions and one child's edition for grandchildren."
4,"An amazing story, but a tough read","While reading Three Cups, I was awed and inspired by the Greg Mortenson story. But the book itself was a tough read. There was soooo much detail that, at times, the story got lost. I am not sure if the author was trying to make the book longer or if the editor was being lenient, but there was way too much detail. I do not think that the ex-girlfriend, the details of every road trip, or Greg's discomfort at having gained weight really added anything to the story. That being said, I truly admire the work that is being done by Greg and CAI. I would still recommend this book - expecially to any American who wants to better understand the challenges of the people of Afganistan and Pakistan."
4,Transforming one's life to open new doors for others,"The genius of this book is the author's capacity for transformation. Instead of being disgruntled when he could not reach his goal, he chooses to respond to the human needs he sees around him. This is a fine lesson for all of us: to see the opportunities that lie before us instead of the path we thought we wanted.A most worthwhile book to enjoy and imitate.[ASIN:1604150386 Second Chance at Your Dream: Engaging Your Body's Energy Resources for Optimal Aging, Creativity and Health]]"
1,never got the product,the product have never arrived. I dont know whos fault was it but this was actually the second time i order this book and never arrived. I doubt i will get anything from this user again.
5,"Amazing story, well told",This is an inspiring story that should be recommended reading in American schools. What a wonderful example of the possitive and unlimited results of a single person's efforts and perseverance this book is. I highly recommend this book to everyone over 12.
1,Not happy with the condition of the book,When I received the book it was in poor condition. When I ordered the book it said it was in good condition. It looked like something was spilt all over the pages. I ended up going out and purchasing a new one at the book store. I spent $8 more than I would have if I did that in the first place. I would be very apprehensive to order another one on Amazon.
1,This man is a fraud,"I loved this book when I read it. Then I was shocked to discover that the author is a fraud. Please do not buy his book. (He takes the profits for himself, not for his charity; he even takes a lot of the charity's money for himself.) Get a copy from the library and read it; then read ""Three Cups of Deceit"" by Jon Krakauer. As I read Krakauer's book I became more and more stunned at the audacity of Mortenson. It is clear what the facts are. Read both books and decide for yourself."
5,Really Inspiring Story,I loved this story and was really inspired to do more with my life. I really liked that the writing style was more in the style of fiction writing. I felt that a story like this could end up being related in a really dry fashion otherwise and the descriptive writing really helped me wrap my brain around a landscape completely foreign to me.
5,Change Your Life...Read this Book!,"I just finished reading Three Cups of Tea and it has opened my eyes to a beautiful and often misunderstood people and what one man can do to really change to world - in a peaceful way. We should all thank Greg Mortenson for his unrelentless sacrifices to making this world, that region and America a safer and better place. Please take the time to read this amazing book. It will change your life!"
5,Most Important Book of the Year!,"All the yahoos in Bush's White House, congress and the senate need to read this book. It is a powerful lesson on a real common-sense way to deal with terrorism, which is more in line with the thinking and compassion that once made America the most admired country in the world, instead of the most reviled that it has become.This is the most important book I've read in years, and has inspired me (who is not easily persuaded) to take action.Talk about making your charitable dollars make a difference. I don't know where you can make more of a personal impact on the world than with Greg Mortenson's ""Central Asian Institute."""
5,An avenue for peace,"This book is one of the best I have ever read and the message is one that needs to be spread.As an American who lived and worked in the Middle East, I could readily understand the misunderstandings of westerners trying to do business in this region. Greg Mortenson had the acumen, patience and persistence needed to overcome many obstacles. His vision of bringing education to the children of Afghanistan and Pakistan was realized. His story expresses the fact that peace is not gained by guns but by understanding and through education. Honesty is paramount - not empty promises. Nothing good comes easy and Greg Mortenson took great risks and was willing to sacrifice everything he had to achieve his dream. He exemplifies the best in mankind.I highly recommend it for everyone."
5,Excellent reading!,"Leaders of the United Nations should all be required to read this book, they could learn a lot! This was very enjoyable. An eye opener. We are so fortunate to have schools for our children and adults. We should not take such things for granted!"
4,Inspiring Story,"Greg Mortenson is a great man, and his book performs a valuable service by showing the compassionate face of Islam to an American audience. Mortenson reminds the reader constantly that he's too busy running his foundation to even find time to sleep. I think he was also too busy to fully collaborate with the ghost writer, whose portraits of Mortenson and the other central players seem two dimensional."
5,Three Cups of Tea,"This is the most moving book I have ever read. I highly recommend it. I thing Greg Mortenson deserves the Nobel Peace prize. Excellent book, excellent effort by Mr. Mortenson."
5,Not to be missed,"I borrowed this book originally from a friend and was so impressed by it that I ordered 4 additional copies - one for the library, 2 for different relatives, and one for myself to share. It helped me to understand some of the problems in Pakistan today, and also appreciate what a wonderful person Greg Mortenson is. It is a very special book and one not to be missed."
4,Important Book,So inspiring to read and so important to see the real living and loving people living in Pakistan. I feel this book goes a long way to heal the discord between countries.
1,SCAM,"""Greg uses Central Asia Institute as his private ATM machine--that there's no accounting. He has no receipts.""As told to Jon Krakauer, a former friend and financial supporter of Greg Mortenson, by one of Mortenson's staffer.Mortenson is a nothing but a complete scam, like Ponzi, Madoff, and all sorts of TV evangelists.This book belongs in fiction; if it weren't so inherently evil in it's destruction of all real humanitarian efforts."
5,Must Read!,Certainly an important book that is also a page turner. I bought a bunch of copies for friends and I wish the whole world reads it!!!!
4,A Way to Peace and Understanding,"More Americans need to read this book. Greg Mortenson is determinedly demonstrating a way Pakistan, Afghanistan, and similar countries can find their way to peace and understanding. Building schools for girls is creating a culture that can relate to people of a different culture on a basis other than that of conflict."
5,WOW! Three Cups of Tea is amazing!,I have always felt that war was a poor way to solve problems but until I read this book I could envision no other way to solve global problems. Un-biased education is truly the path to world peace.Throughout history we can see how easily illiterate people can be brainwashed by propaganda. Literacy allows people to read the facts for themselves and with that knowledge comes the ability to differentiate the truths from the propaganda.This will be a great Christmas present to all me friends who love a good book.
5,inspiring,"3 cups is inspiring and well written, painting pictures of the passion and challenges of making lives better in far off lands by building schools for kids and by building relationships"
4,Three Cups of Tea,The book was very timely & well written. I was a pleasure to read about the good that was done for the children.
5,Excellent Service,The book was delivered in record time and was in excellent condition. The seller was most timely in his/her response to the request for the book. Thank you so much. Joyce
5,Three Cups of Tea,This book was amazing! I bought three copies so I can give them as gifts. The gift that Greg has given has been passed along to us. We can read about his incredible journey and then figure out what we can offer to help our world. I loved the book and I look forward to doing my part.
1,three cups of tea,"An interesting personal life, but one of the worst written books I have ever tried to read. I finally gave up about one third of the way through. It so badly needed editing and condensing that it was literally hard work to figure out the basic story."
1,"very good story, but awful writing",I was sold on what this book was going to be about. I mean who doesn't want to read about great things! But it's too bad that they couldn't get a better writer to tell a great story. What a SHAME!
5,Must read,"Great read for teachers. Also for those who wish to learn more about Islam, politics and people in general."
1,Poorly written,This story could have been told more effectively in a magazine article. It is boring and poorly written. The overuse of adjectives is maddening. I could not finish it. The writer treats his readers as morons. It diminishes the accomplishments of Greg Mortensen. I have no idea how this book achieved best seller status. I would give it no stars if that was possible.
2,The Pot Calling the Kettle Black,"I loved the book! I even paid $30 to go listen to Mortenson speak and sent CAI a couple of bucks. If it is a fraud, of course I'd be disappointed but it was still a moving story whether not it was accurate. If he's been pocketing enormous speaking fees on top of collecting $180K salary as Chief of CAI, I have a lot of contempt for him.Considering the historical record of CBS News, I thought it was pretty darn funny that criticisms about inaccuracies were coming from them."
2,I Threw it Across the Room After 150 Pages,"My wife and I are avid book sluts. We read a lot - fiction, history, non-fiction, whatever. We are both interested in the mideast as well, trying to understand the culture and history, and also looking for ways that America and Americans can somehow ""do the right thing."" That is, help people lead better lives and not trip over our own cultural blinders.The book tells an interesting story of the the efforts of Gregg Mortenson to impact elementary education in the high mountain regions of Pakistan. It is an inspiring story, told poorly. It is co-authored and unclear how much Mortenson contributed to the text - I suspect he spent a lot of time talking into a recorder - and his collaborator is on his own trip. The result is an incredibly awful book conveying a story that more Americans should know. Too bad. I suggested to my wife to skim it and recycle it back to the used books store."
4,Textbook for school,Shipping was prompt - no problems with the order. I got this book for my son who is studying it at school as part of his assigned reading.
2,"Yeah, we know Greg must be a great person, but don't repeat it!","If you want to read and learn about a culture of Pakistan and Afghanistan, you should find another book. This is the book about the life of Greg Mortenson and how great he is. After the half of the book, you would find everything is repetitive and feel like ""Yeah, we know Greg must be a great person, but don't repeat it!"".Don't get me wrong. He did some good thing I could never be able to do."
5,A memorable read,Three Cups of Tea is a profoundly moving report about how one man can make a difference in a region dominated by blood and war. The story was interesting from start to finish. Truely an impressive man. I highly recommend it to any and all.
5,Inspirational,"Greg Mortenson's work is overwhelmingly inspirational. Last year, I went to a garage sale to find young girls selling lemonade to ""benefit building schools in Afghanistan"". I couldn't believe that american girls knew there were children in Afghanistan, when the adults only talk of the terrorists and the bombing in that unknown part of the world. I asked the girls and they told me they read this book at school. It was only after I read it myself that I understood how Greg Mortenson's work can let the world know that there are innocent children in Pakistan and Afghanistan who want to get an education and that we are able to do something for them. Wonderful job."
4,amazing and inspirational,"We read Three Cups of Tea for my book club selection and everyone who read it thought it was awesome. It certainly tells an amazingly true story of Greg Mortenson and his (secular) mission, in an adventurous and exciting way. It gives you a lot of perspective on your own life as well, since it allows you a view of lifestyles and people who truly have very little economically. It was truly inspirational and I would recommend it to anyone who dares to be open to the understanding of other countries, cultures and religious backgrounds..."
2,not a good read,"If you're looking for an exciting and engaging read, this is not it. A quarter into the book, I found myself really tired of reading it. It's not something you can breeze through. I can't tell you anything about the story since I didn't finish it, it was just too boring."
2,Great book until someone tells you it is fake,"It is a very well writing, inspiring book. Unfortunately most of it probably didn't happen, which I found out halfway through the book and is why I stopped reading it."
3,Disappointing,"This is a biography of Greg Mortenson, who after an alleged failed attempt to scale the earth's second highest peak, wandered into an isolated mountain village, where he resolved to repay the generosity of the village leader and his people by building them a school. Mortenson's struggle to fulfill that promise and then committing himself to fund raising and building many more schools, for both boys and girls in this Muslim country, is the central subject of this long, well detailed book. Unfortunately, the reality of what he did was quite different."
2,Good story poorly executed,in my opinion of course. This book has great reviews and I loved the story itself but I really wanted to hear about the people not just Greg.
3,Disappointed.,"I have to say that I was pretty bored with most of this book. I was surprised at all the high ratings it received. Maybe it just wasn't my ""cup of tea""."
4,Great story,"This is a great story about the level extreme need in central Asia and the extreme efforts that must be made to meet it. The story is excellent and heartwarming, regarldess of the recent negative press and questions about whether it is fiction or non-fiction. Even if it turns out to be 50% fabricated, Mortensen has done infinitely more for eduction in that region than I can ever hope to accomplish."
1,$12.99 for Kindle $6.98 for Softcover Book is Bad for the Earth,"Paperback costs $6.98.There are over 1000 available from $2.40.The Kindle price of $12.99 totally defeats the purpose of buying a Kindle and is contrary to the idea that ebook readers are good for the Earth.If I can find this book at the library, then I will read it b/c it was recommended by a FB friend. But as a matter of principle I will not pay more for a Kindle book than for a paper book.In my opinion, the book price is a critical factor in judging the book and therefore, I am posting my opinion. Flame if you like, but I have a right to my opinion about ebook pricing."
5,a giant among men,"Have you ever felt helpless before events unfolding in the Middle East? This book is a call to activism by amazing example. At last someone who is really winning the war against ignorance and extremism. This inspiring account of real, tangible progress against taliban and al queda domnination in Pakistan and Afganistan is a welcome relief to war and the seeds of hatred it sows. Instead of bombing and destruction, Greg Mortensen has devoted his life energies to bringing literacy and health care to isolated villages where extremists prey on those who cannot even read the Koran. He has connected with the villagers on a personal level and forged lasting bonds of friendship in a way that our tanks, planes and bombs can never achieve. Not only is Three Cups of Tea a riveting account of his against-all-odds successes, it shows how peace and understanding can be won, as he says, ""One school at a time."" This book is a must-read for all in the US."
3,Thr3e cupz of teaz!,Thr3e cupz of teaz is t3h ub3r ub3r l33t much like t3h aar0n burr!Is 4 t3h d0xi3s! I rat3d it thr3e f0r Thr3e cupz of teaz!
5,Amazing book...,"I've been reading the paperback copy of this book and have been totally engrossed. I decided to get the Kindle version for my work commute. The descriptions are amazing and the content engaging. This came highly recommended to me and I can definitely recommend it to others!His start with trying to master the mountain results in a life long commitment helping others. His drive, passion, and mission to promote peace in a troubled part of the world is exhilarating!A must read!"
1,Worst writing I've read in a long time,"You decide for yourself what you think about Mortenson. I think the subtitle of the book should be ""How One Man Became a Dhimmi.""What I will say is that the writing of the co-writer is nauseating. It is the most frantically hysterical hagiography you'll ever see. ""The crystalline daggers of the mountain ranges scratched their way like deranged fingernails into the howling wind of the overarching midnight blue ocean of the sky--the same sky that hung over the head of the ancient, proud, morally superior, but so horribly vulnerable people that Mortenson had left the despicable excesses of the United States and crossed the earth pennilessly to save before it was too late.""I made that sentence up but it is better than a lot of the sentences in the book. Read at your own peril."
1,Shame on your lies!,"Shame shame on you for the lies you put down in this book and then NOT ONLY telling people it was true, but ASKING for MONEY. More money is spent on book expenses than charity. The author keeps all the income from book signing and the foundation pays the expenses. He said he was kidnapped, but he PAID the men to ""PROTECT HIM"" 60 MINUTES did a 7 month investigation and he REFUSED to speak to them. Shame on you!! Return the money to the American children you stole from.Set the record straight and do what you are supposed to with the money."
5,Beautiful,"I am afraid I may begin gushing over this book, and over Greg Mortenson. WHY has this man not won the Nobel Peace Prize? His work in Pakistan and Afghanistan is nothing less than miraculous. He has worked tirelessly to start schools for Muslim children, particularly girls. He was in Pakistan on 9/11 and stayed for two months, while the State Department was warning Americans to get out, to finish the projects he was there to oversee.Providing secular, moderate education to Muslim children, he says, is the only way to truly combat the fundamentalist teachings of jihad. And I believe him with all my heart. READ this book...and you will too."
5,Highly Recommend,"It was nothing short of amazing reading through what he endures to keep his promise. The passion, determination, persistence and the willingness to throw his life to fulfill that one promise - build schools for children from some of the poorest regions of the world; is very touching to the soul and refreshing to the mind."
5,three cups of tea,This is an excellent non-fiction book. It was recommended to our entire group that supports education for women (American Association of Women).
3,Too Good to be True,"""Three Cups of Tea"" was an exciting book that kept me reading. The stories it contained were well written and done in a manner that was very inspiring and happy-hearted. I was disappointed to learn the book, which is written as non-fiction, turned out to be mostly a work of fiction. Right after finishing ""Three Cups of Tea,"" I read ""Three Cups of Deceit"" by my favorite author Jon Krakauer. He goes on to point out and prove that Greg Mortensen is a liar and a thief in many respects. I would recommend this book as much as any other fictional novel."
4,Three Cups of Tea,"I had a hard time with the first part of the book, just getting used to all the names of the countries and the tribes and skimmed over some of the lengthy descriptive sections. The map in the front was helpful. Once the story started I became involved and extremely interested in the people and their culture. There was a very strong message here and I wish that everyone would ascribe to it. I would strongly recommend reading this very moving and inspirational account of one man's ability to make a difference."
2,"Poorly written, dull",I was shocked to see the ratings as well. I read more than half the book and it is VERY boring. I can't even finish it.
5,Dare to dream about something bigger than yourself...,"Greg Mortenson's story is compelling and real. In a well-written mini-tome about his failed attempts to reach the summit of K-2 but his successes in creating schools (particularly for girls) in Pakistan, he shows us that dreams can be achieved over time. His book is a reminder to everyone that perseverance and humility can go a long way.Mortenson does a wonderful job of painting a picture of the people and landscape of the region. The book opens the imagination and includes pertinent historical facts that tie the reader to history. The characters, descriptions, and situations are iterated with incredible detail. And in his descriptions of his own personal sacrifices, ranging from sleeping in his car to his relationship with a woman who grew impatient with him because of his wayward life at the time, he allows us to know him a little bit.An excellent book. It made me want to travel to Pakistan."
4,Every American should read this book,"I was given ""Three Cups"" by a good friend. Taken with the story and not content simply to return the book, I bought two more copies to give to friends in the hopes that they too would pass the books along. This is a true story of an admittedly flawed person trying--and often succeeding--in making the world a slightly better place. Most Americans have a very limited understanding of other cultures, regions, religions, and political situations. Greg Mortensen's story shows that any of us can play a part in correcting this--and by doing so, promoting peace, tolerance, education, and harmony."
3,"Inspiring, but don't know if I can trust it","If you are looking for an inspiring story, you will find it here. I loved this book, and it gave me hope. The downside is that right after I read it all the Greg Mortenson controversy came out. It doesn't take away the inspiration factor, but it makes you feel a little less good about the world when you think of the 60 minutes investigation."
3,From Belief to Disappointment,"I have mixed thoughts about this author and his writing. When I read the book I was inspired by the life commitment he made to these impoverished people. I felt that in my own life I was not doing enough to help those in need. After finishing the book I learned about the inconsistencies and improbable events not to mention the accusations of the author benefiting personally through the financial generosity of others to his organization. I recall many of the religious figureheads doing the same, boasting of the good they do only to be caught in their own web of human desire. I'll reflect on the book as an example of how mankind can better treat his brother but I will not consider Mortenson as anything but a person that while claiming to do good for others was busy satisfying his own needs."
4,3 Cups of Tea...thoughtful and thought provoking,"To read this book is important for those that seek a better understanding of the peoples and their beliefs that are in headlines of our daily news. The cities and countries...Afganistan, Kabul, Pakistan, Baltistan all names so foreign to us become real on the pages of this book. The dedication of one man to change the world by educating one child at a time one school at a time. Really a remarkable story. I volunteer my time to a non-profit after school program called HEART proyouth that shares the same ideals that Mr. Mortenson supports. Our children are in our communities in the Central Valley of California. Our mission is the same to bring change through education. Keep children out of ""gangs"". Teach then that they have choices. Our children whether here or across the water are all of our future."
5,Three Cups of Tea,The author succinctly decribes Greg Mortenson's true story of adventure and courage. Greg's total focus on the building of schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan could help the U.S. understand how to really help these battered countries in a peaceful and constructive way.
1,"Regardless of the media, this guy is self-absorbed","beyond any level I've ever known. First of all the book features a lengthy preface explaining how wonderful Greg is. Then when the book starts, you soon realize the author is writing about himself, but IN THIRD PERSON! that made me chuckle at first, but then really sad when I realized I'd spent $9 on a book written by a prude, self-centered and egotistical Western man. He ventures to remote Afghan-Pakistan border regions to engage with people on the most superficial way, very reminiscent of the whole pathetic ""new age"" condescending dilettantism in the way he seeks to ""bring cultures together"" through education. The saint comes to rescue Afghan children from eternal ignorance!This is a lousy attempt at very corny fiction, and a very pathetic attempt at non-fiction."
5,Three Cups of Tea,"The author writes in the third person which I found a little hard getting used to. However, once I did, I found the book to be every interesting. In reading about what the author did to help the children of Pakistan and Afghanistan, one can't help wondering what the world would be like if, instead of bombing people we found out what they need and help them get it. This is a book that everyone should read. I enjoyed reading it and plan to read it again."
1,Mortenson Should Be Prosecuted for Fraud,"It is so sad to see how Mortenson lied about the people helping him and used money meant for schools for himself. What is most disturbing is how many people are still trying to cover for him. The gig is up. Read ""Three Cups of Deceit"" by Jon Krakauer."
5,Wonderful inspiring story,"Three Cups of Tea is about the most inspiring book I've ever read. I found this well-told story compelling and suspenseful and was unable to put it down until I'd finished. The background and perspective it offers of the cultures and politics of Pakistan and Afghanistan were remarkably vivid and edifying and at the same time as gripping as a detective novel. In this current period of worldwide conflict, this story of Greg Mortenson's dedication and accomplishments make you believe in an attainable and better future. That alone would make it a worthwhile read."
5,Profoundly Written - An Inspired Journey and Book,"One of the best books I've ever read. It is beautifully written - a door is opened to you on a precious culture, a way of life, and a people that face their many challenges bravely. We are welcomed in and inspired by this story. One cannot read this book and harbor narrow views of the people of Pakistan, Afganistan or the Islamic world. One cannot read this book and not want to make a contribution to the ongoing development of schools and other necessities to reach the peoples of these lands."
5,My best Christmas present,"This has given me a whole new perspective on what I have been led to believe about what is going on in that part of the world. This is a story of an amazing man and how kindness, passion for a cause and perseverance can change lives and the way we view those who are different from us. If everyone who reads this book contributes $100 to the CAI's efforts, wouldn't we all be better for it!"
1,3 Cups of Tea,"I bought this book but wished I hadn't. The writing is just awful! It is so badly written that it was hard to bother reading the book all the way through. It feels like it was written by people trying to blow their own trumpets but with a severe lack of writing skills. It gets the thumbs down - don't waste your money, folks. Other people have built schools and written better books."
1,Not my cup of tea,"This was a book club book and of the 7 members not one person liked this book. Over half the group didn't even finish it. We couldn't figure out what all the hype was over this book as we have all heard rave reviews. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Perhaps much of my disappointment was due to the fact that this book had excellent reviews on Amazon. Typically I find these reviews accurate and almost always enjoy books listed in the What Other Books Customer Bought section. I was so excited to read this book only to be majorly disappointed about 1/3rd of the way into it. It is a ""played out"" genre, slow and overly detailled about unimportant things. I was hoping one person in our book club liked it so I could see the magic."
1,One of the few books I couldn't finish..,"I was so excited to begin reading this book. After all, it was rated so highly by so many sources. I read half of the book and stopped. I found it to be boring and the writing was dull and unimaginative. What a disappointment. I think this story could have been told in a much more readable way. As a librarian, I make it a point to finish all books, no matter how difficult it may be. With this one, I couldn't keep going. I just became disinterested and could not make myself read until the end."
2,Too much information,The basic story of the goal to educate so many children is inspiring.BUT the author is in love with WORDS - he describes every rock in Afganistan! Too much detail in describing the journeys made bringing supplies into region. It takes away from the story.
5,Eye opening and entertaining!,"I just read this book in my book club and was blown away by Greg Mortenson and his story. This book is entertaining, educational and inspiring and I encourage everyone to read it. It's an easy read, but I had a lump in my throat the entire way through from the sadness I felt for the hardships of the people he helped and from the amazing way one man was able to make such a huge difference. This book is a must-read for so many reasons!"
5,Promoting peace,"This is a wonderful book. It is a shame that policy makers do not think beyond the use of bombs and ammunition in their attempt to bring ""peace""."
3,A...phenomenon,"In our age of mass communication and social media, there are many more meteors in the skies than in days of yore. All meteors, of course, either crash and survive as fragments, burn completely to ashes, or pass as a fireball through our atmosphere, returning to the void. I guess we can say now that the Mortenson meteor has experienced all three fates, depending on whom you ask. If there is fiction and self-aggrandizement in this book, that will not distinguish it from very many autobiographical writings. Makes for very interesting reading, regardless of the light in which it is read."
1,I fell asleep!,"Both my mom and I read this book and we both had the same feelings about it, which is very rare, but we both thought this book was incredibly boring! Every time I would sit down to read it I would find myself dozing off to sleep! Not only was this book something people would read if they had sleeping problems, because once you opened the book you would already be asleep, but many things in this book turned out to not be true. This book truly was a dissapointment because I had heard many good reviews on it."
5,Great Book! Highly Recommended!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about what Mortenson has done and the things he had to go through to get them done. It has danger, drama, romance, and plenty of good deeds. Once you get done reading you will be calling him a hero."
3,Three Cups of Tea,"The book is fine. A bit slow, but a good read. Unfortuneately, I had to get the book from the library. The vendor, Motor City Books, never bothered to send the book."
5,Three Cups of Tea,"A gripping book about a phenomenal man and his quest to overcome the geography, poverty, jealousy, fanaticism, ignorance and hate that deprive children in Pakistan and Afghanistan of education. I look forward to reading it again and again, as its triumphs and hope are timeless."
1,Full of lies. Its a fictional book.,"The author tells a compelling story, yes a fictional story. He has duped millions into reading this book which was based on things that did not happen, exaggerations and cooked up events."
5,Freedom through Education,"As an ESL teacher who has worked with immigrants and refugees from all over the world, I was excited to read Three Cups of Tea. I expected to learn more about Afghanistan and Pakistan,and about the lives of the ordinary people who live there. What I did not expect was that Greg's book would be so pertinent to the lives of my fourth grade students here in America, but it was. I read many passages aloud to my inner-city students, who were startled to learn about the extreme dedication to education of the students in the book. We had several deep discussions about the differences in living conditions world over and how education can make a difference. Many of my students have parents who gave up everything so that their children could be educated in the States. Greg's book helped my students to see how valuable education is for themselves, their families, and their communities. My students and I look forward to reading more!"
5,Book of the Year,"It is barely February, but I think I have read my book of the year. Greg Mortenson is an inspiration and David Relin's account of his magnificant work is compelling. I was hooked after reading the back cover. This book shows love and humanity across cultures and reminds us of the real values that are often lost in our material world. Read it and donate to the cause it will be time and money well spent!"
5,Great book,"I just have to disagree with reviewers who somehow got the impression that Greg Mortenson built his schools single-handedly or claimed that he did. One of the best features of the book, for me, was how much credit he gave to the local people, and how much he leaned on them, which I think he knew was the key to truly helping them. Give a man a fish and all that.Also I didn't find that the authors claimed to be ""fighting terrorism"" (and even mention in the end that they fought hard to pull ""terrorism"" out of the subtitle) for which some reviewers criticized them. I got the impression the goal was just to help some folks, and it spiraled from there.Great book!"
1,This Author should be prosecuted...,"The schools mentioned by this fake author are all fake, ghost schools or even run by other people or organisations and owned by this fraudulent lier. This book should be taken off amazon for its content is fake, concocted and implausible.Please take this objectionable book off amazon."
4,This is a template on how to eliminate terrorism,I adore this book and believe that education is the answer. One person can make a difference.
5,Seeking to understand other cultures and creating peace,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Three Cups of Tea, and have recommended it to many. I found it hard to stop reading it, finished it in only a few days, and was sorry there wasn't more to read. The story itself was exciting, and had many cliff-hangers, but at the end, the messages of peace, charity, and understanding other cultures were the feelings that endured."
5,Quality Instrumental with Spunk.,"My fellow Birds of Feather, let us prepare to immerse ourselves into a melodious bird bath of the odd and the delightful: The cosmic collision of two different worlds- The Hollyridge Strings and the Beatles. Unfortunately, all that remains of our beloved chicken after crossing the Beatles Express is a few melodic plucks captured by the Hollyridge Strings. This is a spirited album definately worthy of all it's acclaim. I always wanted a great instrumental version of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". I finally found it. Anyone who knocks this music is sadly ignorant."
