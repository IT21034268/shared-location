4,Shine On,"Caught halfway between the Smiths and the Stone Roses, but without reaching the heights of either, the House of Love were(and they've reunited recently) nonetheless a very interesting cusp of the decade band that created darkly romantic tunes that, even though briefly, caught the attention of the british audience with songs as beautiful as ""Shine On"" or""Beatles and the Stones""."
2,Disappointing Songs by a Very Talented Artist.....,"I, a male fan of Andy Griggs, feel that his songs need more pizzazz!! I have every one of Keith Urban's albums and actuallydoubles of them. One set for the house and one for the car. Keith's work is just as sensuous as Andys when he wants it to be. But, what rhythm and beat. Keith's music is addictive to both gals and guys. Andy, on the other hand, has great talent, but there is nothing particularly exciting about THIS I GOTTA SEE. I think tracks 7,9 , and 10 are good. The other tracks drone on. I have all three of Andy Griggs albums, but let this guy loose!!! He'll crack the charts. Right now his work seems more than somewhat restrained. I am very impressed by the fact that Andy keeps his brother Mason's memory alive at all times. THAT, is the most wonderful thing of all!! But, as admirable as that is, the industry won't care. They care about NUMBERS!!"
2,not this one,"I agree with the previous reviews. When it works it's fun but getting it to work is hard! My game only works with just the original houses, objects and sims. Any downloaded stuff and the fame career track shuts down. So I have one neighborhood with fame track and the rest where you can't only visit. Don't buy this one. Stay with Vacation and Unleashed - they aren't nearly so much trouble."
4,superstar for mac,"waited a long time for this... good fun, but seems to have stability issues... quits unexpectedly at various points in the game... sigh..."
5,Very high quality...,"This book is one of two core books, the other being the Narrarator's Guide. This book is full-color, with pictures from the original Star Trek all the way through Voyager and Enterprise. It has just about every gadget you've ever seen, and some you haven't, available to characters. Classes include Trader, Rogue, Starship Officer, Warrior, etc. If you're a Star Trek fan and enjoy roleplaying, do yourself a favor and get this book!"
5,The best roleplay game I ever had,"This is the best. I'am a narrator and I own all of those decipher manuals. This is the best rpg I ever played. Not just the best of trek rpg ,but the best of all I have played, and I have played almost all.Perfect rules, Perfect manuals (that explain deep the ST universe and clear all on the rules for roleplaying and starship battles, spece astrogation or space hazards), perfect universe : what u are looking more? I have only a thing to say: buy it, and play."
1,Absolute Garbage!,"I have worked out with neoprene for years. My last pair by a different company held up over 5 years. The grizzly fitness sticky paw didn't last 5 days before the thumb and wrist seam split. Tried to contact Grizzly fitness and they ignored my email. Please don't waste your money. Even if this was a defective pair, I wouldn't recomend a company that won't stand behind their product."
1,This product sucks!!!,"I purchased two pairs of these gloves because I've been trying for months to get a pair of the far superior Valeo neoprene weight lifting gloves. Unfortunately Valeo no longer makes them. The Grizzly neoprene gloves are a complete joke. They are seriously about one tenth as thick as the Valeo gloves, and the first time I used them, the stitching between the two middle fingers came undone during the third exercise!! I was extremely disappointed when I opened the box and saw how thin these gloves are, but I figured I'd give them a chance. They are made in Pakistan, and the quality of these gloves is beyond terrible. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE!!"
2,not very good quality,I used the gloves and they ripped between the fingers in the first week. The quality is not very good.
2,Disappointed,"I was really excited to get these gloves to work out with because they don't cover the back of your hand. When I started to use them during a work out I came to find out that they made the bars even more slick. The glove does not have grip in the right place. Notice its only on the palms, making your finger tips extremely hard to grip a bar. I wanted to use these for back work outs, but seems to be best for chest.. Why would I need gloves for chest work outs?"
4,Good so far,"I just finished my first jar of this tooth powder and my cavities have not gotten worse as far as I can tell. One jar lasts about 6 months if you use it about once per day. It's a brown powder that tastes like a weird herb blend. It's bitter, but you get used to it. I'm about to order my second jar now."
2,meh,"not a very well written book. hardly anything is referenced, and the narrative at times is pretty silly. save your money, and google up ""sharks."" everything you want to know and more is on the international shark attack file website, and various other sites. this book is pretty much a summary/collection of advice given by the ISAF and shark attack stories reported to them."
2,wrong pair of gloves shipped,"I gave this 2 stars only because of the following reason.:The gloves pictured were not the pair that I ordered and were shipped to me.If you are interested in purchasing this pair, call or chat with one of their representatives BEFORE you order them.. The order number does does agree with these gloves.."
2,looks nothing like that,"I got two strands of square cheap looking beads, looks nothing like the picture. I'm very disappointed, i can't use this junk in jewelry. 350 pieces HA~ i'd be surprised if it equaled 50. Also there are pictures of rubbernation/ecrafty with the""product mispicture"" this is not a rubbernation/ecrafty product. They are quality stuff, this is junk."
3,"Good concept, good effort","Certainly a good book for a reenactor to bridge the gap in knowledge between reenactments, but the title suggests a detailed study of issued camouflage uniform pieces explanation of sizing and maker's marks, development of the patterns themselves, but this is not the case.Nice pictures, but misses the mark as little time is spent detailing the rationale and aspects of the camouflage and the uniforms they were manufactured into. Does not fully explain the various manufacturers of the fabrics, garments, and the zippers, buttons, pulls, etc.Too much time spent on the post war derivatives and ""special"" examples instead of what was plain, everyday, and common to the Soldaten."
3,Win TV Hauppauge Review,"The software was fairly easy to download and install, but the picture is a bit fuzzy on the computer. Also, the audio has alot of static when the volume is turned up. In all, it does the job as long as your not going strictly for quality."
1,failed and bad tech support,"The tuner failed to work on digital channels. It would lock up when I went from an analog channel to a digital channel. I emailed their tech support. I downloaded and re-installed drivers several times. I returned the tuner by mail and they sent me a new one. It did the same thing. I had been asking for my money back from the first email. But by now three months had passed. He said he could only give me my money back if I had bought it in the last 30 days!I'm sure this thing works on some computers, however it does not work on mine. I will not buy this sort of thing through Amazon again, and I will certainly not buy anything from Hauppauge.I drove to Best Buy and bought a Pinnacle tuner.Tech support that wastes my time and is indifferent to failure is worse than none at all."
5,Satisfying,"I bought this tuner about six months ago. I don't use Windows anymore so I can't really use it any longer, but I can tell that this product is the bang for the buck. It works really well with my old IBM T40 laptop, although I can't do anything else with my computer whenever I started opening the TV application since it requires a great deal of work from the computer.In conclusion, the only issue is the high specs required to make this tuner work on your computer."
3,Great gadget but ..,"It's a great product with acceptable quality video and easy to use software. But the driver doesn't support closed-caption, and changing channels is not as smooth as in other products."
5,Impressive TV,"I bought this item with some hesitation because other products like this have had their problems. However, the installation was quick, and soon I was looking at dozens of analog and hdtv channels from stations some 20 miles away. I did use a HD1 Terk antenna instead of the tiny antenna provided. This an impressive product. No fuss or bother. My laptop ia an MCE Acer 3690."
2,Not as good as it looks,"Doesn't pick up well using it's own antenna for analog nor digital broadcasts in my area where rabbit ears work fine. Using the cable connection, picture is fuzzy and intermittent. Only kept because of travel needs."
2,not working with vista,"I doesn't work well with my Vista business notebook. The program can freeze up on some channels and block you from going to other channels... I guess this is a software issue. Not yet ready, at least with Vista..."
4,Not Bad,"It works exactly how I expected. I don't get great reception, but can't blame the product. It's a great buy if you get good TV reception in your area."
4,Satisfied Customer,The product met my expectations and works well with windows Media Center And Vista. I am not a computer geek and I had no no trouble setting it up and using. I would recommend product
4,"Ordering, Use of Hauppauge Win TVTuner Stick","Commitments made by Seller were kept. Product shipped and arrived several days before the target date, in excellent condition. Use of product proved not as easy as I have encountered a few 'compatibility glitches'. Can't blame product but, I now plan to reformat drive and to re start with a 'clean machine' later this week."
1,Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950 Not What I expected,Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950 stutters and the voice never matches up with the mouths. Bummer
2,There must be better than WinTV-HVR 950,"The only thing I have been able to do with this device is watch a poor cable tv picture on my computer. The included antenna isn't strong enough to pick up any HD channels where I live. I haven't traveled with it yet, and perhaps it will work better in larger markets, but I've found it to be fairly worthless so far. If you cannot pick up an HD signal, keep in mind that the analog cable picture is very poor compared to any TV."
3,Not quite up to the challenge,"I work for a cable company and thought this would be a great way to be able to tune channels and check them without having to have an actual TV since we carry laptops. It failed to work very well. The software was a pain to try to even tune and scan the channels. Even when I got it to scan most of them, it wouldn't tune them correctly. I returned it since it wasn't going to work very well for my purpose."
1,Crash,"The WinTV-HVR-950 crashes every time I use it. I mean that literally. If I use it for any time at all, I usually end up having to restart the application several times.I'll have to buy another stick when we switch from analog to digital, and I won't even bother looking at anything from Hauppauge."
3,Review,"3.5 stars because the picture quality is good when you viewing it in a small window, but if you want to watch it full screen quality goes down. Also sounds sometimes lags behind, you have reopen the program to fix it.Have not tested it in HD, since I have no way of doing it. This product is still good, just has some little problems. I hope quality will go way up as soon as digital signal goes live every where next year."
3,Ehh...,"The hardware is fine, picture quality is acceptable. Sound is a bit spotty and seems to be stuck on ""mono"" for me, the general bundled software is pretty terrible overall. Driver installation isn't a ""sure"" thing under XP/Vista with this device, though I managed to get it to work without MUCH fuss, it still required more than I'd expected.Overall it does serve the purpose I purchased it for, but the software is lacking in basically every possible way for it to do so."
3,Hauppauge WINTV-HVR-950 Tv Stick review,"It is not worth the money! I am 3-4 miles from the tv antenas and it does not get a very good signal, it is rater spoty. the picute is nice but the software is slow, running it on xp 1Gig ram athlon x2 128 meg videoshould be faster.Pictures are somewhat chopyIf desparate for DTV on your computer get it!"
2,Still looking for hdtv on a pc...,"Pentium 4 3.8GHz, 2gb memory, NVIDIA Quadro FX 3400 256mb video card, xp sp2, HP system. Choppy video at best, very good high def image but choppy at times. Impossible to watch. USB just can't handle it. Glad I tested this on my brothers box before upgrading my machine. Would have been a waste."
4,Good buy for the price,"I purchased this TV tuner as a stand-in until I buy a new TV. It works just fine. It was pretty easy to install. I was watching TV on my laptop within 15 minutes of opening the package. I have a Dell laptop running Windows XP Pro, 1 GB RAM, USB-2 Port. I did not notice any slowdown in my laptop performance when I watched TV and opened other applications at the same time.The picture quality is... well... as good as what you would expect for the price you're paying. It is a bit grainy for my analog TV signal, but perfectly viewable. The sound was OK too. For me, that was good enough.I recorded some TV programs and played them back in Windows Media Player. Worked just fine. I have not used the ATSC tuner, so I cannot comment on that. But it seems people are pretty happy with the digital broadcasts.All in all, this product delivers the goods."
3,Cheap but a lot of work - Audio Sync fixed!,So this HVR-950 is a CPU-intenvise product. Huge AV sync issue. This can be fixed by downloading Windows XP Video Decoder Checkup utility (even in Vista) and changing the MPEG-2 decoder to InterVideo. Good luck!
3,Works with Vista,"I got this to use the ""Media Center"" features of Vista. For that it works great. However, the signal is not that clear, so burning DVD's of recorded TV doesn't work that great (because of the fuzzy picture). Works good for watching TV in a small window on the PC. Also cannot watch and record two different shows at the same time.I first tried it with an antenna and it kept locking up the computer when I tuned it to the digital stations (maybe too much info for the hardware). I then hooked it up to the analog cable, which is Standard Def. and it works, but again the signal is not too clear."
4,"Very nice for Analog and Digital TV, buggy software.","It is very nice to get the HD TV on the computer. It opened up a whole new world for me. Needs a dual core or a very fast single core processor.The software WinTV is a bit buggy when recording and playback. The recording cannot be played back on Real Media or Windows Media Player reliably. Sometime the recording works sometimes not. But all recording can be played with WinTV, but WinTV insists that you have the Tuner connected. So it is inconvenient when you want to playback on another computer. Then, WinTV controls for playback are not foolproof. Trying to fast forward too much causes the program to freeze and has to be killed with task manager.If they can get their software right it can be really nice. Already I enjoy the easy recording of programs and having control of the movies my family watches. I hope they will read this and fix their software.AS Koh"
3,Need more horse power than specs require,"Setup and installation of this product where no problem. However if you tune in the standard Analog channels you need a machine a lot more capable than the minimum specs listed to handle the decoding.I put it on an Athlon 2.4+ XP, with 1 gig RAM and 180 GIG HD and it could just barely handle it. On my Dual core 915 gateway system it was no problem at all.ASTC signals are no problem and come in really strong in my area with this device and supplied antenna. A remote would have been nice.I ended up returning the item as that was a cheaper option that upgrading the PC. Will probably opt for an external tuner for the flexibility."
4,Hauppauge WINTV-HVR-950 Tv Stick,"I installed the software on 3 computers. On my Dell 8400 it is great, it worked with my MCE and internal TV board. On my wife's laptop P4 1.6 MHZ duo with MCE it works but not with the MCE software because the HVR-950 is the only TV receiver installed. On my laptop P4 2.66 forget it. The picture was jumpy not watchable. Good product, great picture. It is very dependent on the CPU and speed you are using it with."
4,easy install - works great,very simple install on XP machine. software is a little low rent but works nonetheless. overall great product and eliminates the need to open up box and deal with replacing/subordinating video card. just plug into USB 2.0 and bring standard cable to it.
1,Maybe it's me,"We tried to pick up local channels with the antenna, we even bought another antenna but it didn't work well for us at all."
1,Failed to install,"I have attempted to install this product several times on a Vista laptop and an XP desktop. The installation has failed at every attempt. There is lots of information on the website and new drivers. However, these fail to install as well. I am awaiting a reply from their technical support (it has been 24 hours with no response.) Unless you have a lot of patience I would recommend you look elsewhere for a PC ATSC tuner. I will repost if I eventually get this working."
5,"Great, but make sure your PC is powerful enough","I have one, and it's great -- a HDTV replacement for my battery-powered back-up TV once analog signals go dark (2009). Just make sure your PC or laptop is powerful enough to run it (my 1.7MHz Centrino laptop just cuts it.) Also, it takes quite a bit of power and runs quite hot, so you may need a larger laptop battery. Still, it's a fascinating product!"
3,"Small portable PVR, but has quality issues","I think the best selling point of this PVR is that it's portable - and for that reason, this item may be great. However, I found that between this and the other full-size PCI board Hauppauge products (PVR 150, 250, 500 or others) - the quality of this picture paled in comparison to the other card outputs. I found it to be grainy and of low quality. So if you're buying this for a desktop PC - don't bother - and buy a Hauppauge 150 instead."
4,good atsc tuner. but skip the wintv software.,good hardware. but the wintv software is extremely poor.download and install the latest drivers. Don't bother trying the wintv software. Try other 3rd party software...I'm currently testing with beyondtv and gbpvr software - both are much better than wintv.
3,Far from ready for prime time,"Software out of the box, 12/06 release, does not work, even with the suggested updates from their web site. Documentation is limited with key settings not fully explained. Recording is 8GB per hour. Support 'appears' to rely heavily on the user community to help each other. I don't recommend getting support via email if you need immediate help. Although helpful, you can expect replies only once every 7 -9 days. In retrospect, a $150 15"" HDTV with UHF antenna would provide the same mobility/result (viewing free OTA HD) with no hassle. Bottom line, this is not a product for novices."
4,HD TV on your lap top or PC,"The product works well on both my Notebook and PC, however, the WIN TV program bundle with the item seems to freeze up sometimes especially with my PC which is runing Win Vista. Overall, the reception with just the included antenna is great."
3,Device works ok -software could be better,Device installed without a problem. Software is mediocre. Would be nice toif 16 or so channels were shown at once so you can see what a number of channels had on. I had a PCI/TV card years ago that did this. A numerickeypad would help to jump to a channel easier instead of right clicking then scrolling down a list to select one. Besides these missing goodies once you are on a channel the device works well.
5,Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950 TV Tuner Stick/Personal Video Recorder,We need a Video Amp for the provided antenna to receive more channels. Otherwise it works great!
5,perfect,This bag is just perfect for my little 3 yr. old. She can carry her own leapad now. And it does hold a few books and cartridges. Which is all she needs. I really like this backpack.
4,LeapPad Backpack,"This product was exactly what I was looking for. Great for storage and portability of the Leap Pad, though there is only room for three books and cartridges."
4,Lots of pretend fun!,My granddaughter (2 1/2) loves this. Great little basket to carry (and store) all the goodies for the picnic. Tablecloth is more like a napkin in size (only drawback) so we lay out a small blanket to set up our picnic instead. Great for pretend play!
2,Not very pleased with quality,"This was a very disappointing pan set. The pans are very thin tinplate, as is the divider apparatus. The divider in my set did not fit tightly against the bottom of the pan, necessitating using one hand to hold the divider pressed down while putting the batter in the rings with the other. The divider is very sharp metal and cut me the first time I washed it. Also, once the cake layers are frosted and stacked, the checkerboard effect is greatly diminished. I'm returning this set and if I decide to give this another try, I will order the Norpro set with plastic divider and non-stick pans."
2,rusted on first wash!,"The pans are crappy so I used my own.I read the reviews and knew not to use it as instructed and pour in vanilla and chocolate batter into the same pan.I made a vanilla cake and a chocolate cake and then used the insert to cut the rings out and then restacked them together. That worked well enough.But then when I ran the ""dishwasher safe"" insert through my dishwasher it came out completely COVERED in rust. I had to scrub at it for over an hour with steel wool to get all of the rust off.Not worth it at all. Just cut your own rings and do it yourself."
4,works well,"I purchased a checkerboard cake from a bakery and my brother in law, the family cake baker loved the way it looked. I bought this pan for him for Christmas. I admit, I was skeptical that it would work, but he turned out a beautiful ""checkerboard"" cake on the first try! So, if you have the time to make 2 cake batters and want to show off a unique cake, I reccomend this pan.Norpro Checkerboard Cake Pan SetNorpro Checkerboard Cake Pan Set"
2,Norpro Checkerboard Cake Pan Set,Bit disappointed in this product...find that the steel middle section lifts up and the cake mixture runs underneath which defeats the whole point of the checkerboard effect.Need 2 people when doing this - one to hold down centre while the other pours....disappointing!
1,Don't buy this product!!!,"I've had this juicer for less than a week and it broke down already! It looks sturdy but it is not. The connection of the handle with the main body of the juicer is very, very fragile, and broke donw on the third use, before I had pressed my twentieth orange! Needless to say I am very upset, because this is not a cheap product. I had expected it to last a lifetime, but I am back to my 20-dollar electric juicer."
1,Not yet ready for sale: An Achilles heel,"Mine broke on the first use, with the fourth orange half. The weak spot seems to be the hinged arcs connecting the upper and lower parts. They're cast iron, but my upper arc sheared into two pieces under extremely normal use. It's a shame, because the design seems excellent otherwise. But I'd say don't buy unless (until) the juicer's reengineered to strengthen this weak spot."
1,Ease of Use Exaggerated,"I purchased this for Christmas 2003 from Williams-Sonoma (color: tangerine). While the product description states ""The heavy lid does all the work for you, applying enough pressure to extract maximum juice"", the recipient of my gift found that the Orange-X Ojex Household Juicer requires a substantial amount of pressure be applied by the user before juice is extracted. The disappointed recipient has also informed me that this item is a basic juicer with little or no advantages over other mechanical juicers. She will be returning this item shortly."
3,Where;s the romance,"This is a book about baseball locker rooms in the female leaque, not a lesbian book unless you count two encounters, do Smokey and Mac start dating or develope a relationship or was that just a quickie at the end of the book. I thought they would become lovers but the book does'nt say, everything concerning a romance is left in the air. Just because a book has two or three lesbians in it doesn't make it a storey about lesbian romance. The last two paragraphs describe the completely."
4,Office Scanners,It is an excellent scanner for it is size and shape. I did not need any training to use it. However I thought it would have been more helpful if you can add a video demonstration to explore more functions efficiently.
5,A designer's designer,"If you know design AND happen to be a discriminating music lover, you almost certainly know who Vaughan Oliver is. This pioneering founder of 23 Envelope (later v23) collaborated with 4AD records in the UK since 1981 to help launch the careers and identities of such seminal acts as Cocteau Twins, Pixies, the Breeders, Modern English, Throwing Muses, The Wolfgang Press, His Name Is Alive and many others (Oliver rarely worked with Dead Can Dance--4AD's most successful act). ""Visceral Pleasures,"" which should fit nicely on your shelf next to Oliver's other monograph ""This Rimy River,"" explores more than just his record sleeve work. We get a look at Oliver's more broad career and background as a graphic designer, and get some great inside information and insight into his process and the experience of working with 4AD and its artists. It goes without saying that this book is gorgeously produced and a beautiful thing simply to hold in your hands."
4,Artazia Peace Dove Necklace,"The Peace Dove itself is as beautiful as the picture. My wife has gotten many compliments on the piece. However, the first thing she did was replace the chain."
4,great bon voyage present,"I added this item to qualify a gift order for supersaver shipping. I was hesitant to order a scented candle on line, but I am glad I did. I sent a book and this candle to a friend who was going to visit her husband who had been completing a fellowship in another city. She really liked the scent--orange blossom green fig. (I went to the Mistral site to read more detailed descriptions of the scents.) She also liked the screw-on cap, which she thought would make it very secure in transit. I would order this again."
4,"almost, but not quite....","If you are looking for all Hawaiian applique or similar, this is not the book. It is well designed (binder book) but it is more traditional style applique. Not entirely what I was looking for...albeit some really good stuff!"
5,Love Applique,"I like the book, I will not be doing her take-away method, but there were lots of wonderful ideas that I will be trying in the future. I have one of her patterns and I am wanting to get started. Marian,"
4,72 Names of God: Meditation Deck,"This 'pack of cards' is very interesting to have with you at all times as there is always a helping hint in the pack for whatever situation you are in.One side has a title and a 3 letter name, the other a more in-depth explanation and the same name."
2,Bad translation,"The story itself is not bad, although it does not at all compare with Homer's The Iliad and The Odyssey. With that in mind, the translation itself is awful.I would recommend this book, but only if you can get a better translation of it."
5,The most inspiring book I've ever read,"This is by far, the most inspiring NDE book ever written and I've read them all. Dr Eby's description of heaven and hell and his encounter with Christ will have you reading this book in awe, over and over. Every Christian should read this book."
1,There are better books...,"I too, had this book assigned for a class, it was very disapointing considering javascript is a syntax specific language and there are spelling errors all over (especially in the code). I found that O'Reily's JavaScript book was more helpful with the assignments. Also, ""Perl, CGI, and JavaScript Complete"" from Sybex was an excelent book. It was a major downfall considering I had to go out and buy the other books and use the Internet to make it through the class. Don't BUY this book!"
3,Good rock'n roll oldie videos for kids,"My 2 year old daughter likes this video, she sings along and likes to dance. Sometimes she is scared of the Wooly Bully (a big fuzzy yak with sneakers on -- a person in a costume), but mostly she just thinks it's funny."
4,Great conceal holster,I use this holster for my Walther PPQ and it fits like a glove. The main reason I like this holster is because it doesn't rub against your skin. It is super soft to the touch and you don't even know you are wearing it. The reason I deducted a star is because the belt clip is wimpy and I had the holster and my gun slide out of my pants while I was sitting.
5,Does the job perfectly,"I've gone to where I use this holster over all my others, even my Galco holsters. I bought a LEFT handed holster because in the small of my back that position is perfect for right-handed draw. It goes well with or without a belt, and I've been wearing it now for over a year daily. I carry a full size .45 1911-A1 in it and have yet to see one I'd rather have. I'm actually purchasing another for my wife to carry her Ruger 9mm."
2,Nice but not secure,"The blackhawk holster feels very comfortable when worn and conceals very nicely, even the full size Beretta I carry. The only problem is that there is no retention on this holster at all. I was hoping when buying this it would offer some passive retention so my gun would not fall out but it doesn't. The holster is basically a bag that holds your gun to your belt. My Beretta fell out when I sat down or when I jump. I would not recommend this holster to keep any weapon secure!"
5,Blackhawk Holster,Great little holster. Bought size 01 which fits my Sig Sauer 380 perfectly. Is really comfortable to wear. Gun slides out and holster stays in place. This is perfect for conceal carry.
1,Cannot re holster,If you have a full size hand gun this is not the holster for you. Its very difficult to even get on because its so flimsy and if you had to draw from it you aren't re holstering your weapon without taking your pants off. Needs a reinforced opening.
3,strap is difficult to manipulate,Blackhawk makes quality products that are comfortable however; the retention strap is not very conventional for this application. The strap is difficult to manipulate from the angle at which your arm is at the access part of your draw and ultimately takes extra time to draw.
3,Good product,"Product received on time on an good package, I have used on some opportunity and all ok but for often user internal cover could get damages due friction."
4,Good for the price,"I have this holster for a full size .40 cal Smith & Wesson. The holster material is soft which can make reholstering difficult. However, I do not have any issues putting the gun back in the holster safely. It may take a little more time but it's not impossible. The stituch was a little loose toward the top near the opening. But I use this holster daily and can draw fine if I need to. It's not the best holster but it conceals pretty well. The clip is sturdy and sits well(the grip is right above my belt). Hope this helps."
4,BlackHawk 73IPO1BK Holster,"Seems to be comfortable enough, I got to wear looser shirts, mine still shows a bump, I'm used to wearing ""T"" shirts, so I have to adjust to regular shirts, no big deal."
2,Unsafe Chinese crap,"I carry a Glock 27. This holster screams ""accidental discharge"" all over it. It fits around the GLock and even kind of snug but thats about all. The nylon is like a one size fits most and the plastic clip thats affixed to it is flimsy crap. Literally if you bought a wool ankle sock and attached a carabeener to it it would be just about as good as this holster. I would ccnsider carrying with this holster if I had a gun with a safety on it but I definately would not carry with any other firearm.Why play games with your safely or the safely of others with this thing? You have been warned. You get what you pay for."
5,comfortable fit,"This holster is well made and sturdy. It provides a comfortable fit for my licensed concealed gun. However, if you have a belt overhang from a hefty waistline, it might be difficult to retrieve your gun easily"
5,Good for purse,This holster is great for women who carry concealed in their purse. It stays in place nicely but protects the trigger so I don't worry about negligent shootings. It's not expensive and does the job!
5,Great holster for the cost.,"I bought 2 of these. The Size 6 fits a SIG P250 Compact and a FNP9-M. The Size 7 fits a Ruger SR9c and a SIG P250 subcompact. So far, these are comfortable. The price is great compared to $50 or more for some other holsters. The clip is large so it provides a secure attachment to your pants. Pistols slide in and out every easily. You can't go wrong with this holster."
4,works ok after a lil adjustment,"had my mate cut off some hemming next to the trigger housing so my .40 would actually sit down in a bit deeper and then re-sew it so it wouldn't unravel.if it only had another 1/2"" of material on the top flap i wouldn't have to feel my slide gouge into my side when ever i sit.a thumb break strap would also allow u to pull the holster into a position so that the lack of material would b a non issue as it would keep the slide off our skin and outta your side when u sit.it's ok for an inexpensive holster."
1,Day trips on St.Martin,"I bought three books when planning my trip to St.Martin.""Ulysses due south"",""St.Martin/St.Barts Alive"" and this one.The first two are excellent sources of information.""Day trips""offers only brief descriptions and directions,which is ok I guess,but you'll still need one of the other books(I preferred Ulysses)for a broader overview.I'll be going back,but""Day trips on St.Martin""won't be going with me."
4,Dispels the mystery and ignorance about deacons,"I am applying for the diaconate program in our diocese, and this fast-reading book was an excellent introduction to the role of the deacon in the Catholic Church. Despite the renewed emphasis on deacons since Vatican II, there is still a lot of ignorance about the deacons' responsibilities and the nature of their sacrament of ordination. This book explains how deacons are different from priests and bishops, and yet how they are similar, as well. I have found it invaluable in my discernment about being called to the diaconate."
2,Faded,this faded with in the first few months. Bought this for the front on my trailer. Would not buy another one.
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"Our Original Praise & Worship team was part of a workshop by Alvin Fruga a few years ago. After reading this book, we made it the required study for participation in the music ministry at our church. So wish it came with a workbook as well. It would make for the perfect material in Music Ministry classes. The chapter ""Stop the Music"", wow!!!!!!!!! A matter of the fact, we are about to go through a refresher course in our music ministry and we are starting back with chapter one. If I were rich enough, I would surely call Mr. Fruga and have him show up to one of the classes as a suprise. They would but sooo awe struck! LOL"
3,Marco Palo,"A little disappointed. I was expecting a little more on the natural scenery and burden of beast for the travel. It dealt with a lot of political issues trying to follow the travel routes of Marco Polo. I want to feel how it was, not what the political issues we are facing now in following the footsteps."
5,American Brave Hearts,"Why look to Hollywood or History books when real life heroes can be found right in New York City! Who could ask for better mentors for our youth than Belliveau and O Donnell?Watch their awesome travel adventure and your heart rate will go up when you imagine the stresses and immense dangers they encountered. This is a must see for anyone who wants to experience sensitivity to world issues, grass roots brotherhood and natural beauty brought to us by two brave artists."
4,great book horrible price,"I have been looking for this book for a long time and just got the chance to see it. The book has more reproductions than the thin book on Lopez, but I have to say given what was in the book it wasn't that amazing, and I certainly don't believe it to be worth more than $200.Pricing this book at more than $200 is robbery. I suppose that because this book is no longer in print its value has risen, but $2,000?, thats just ridiculous. My suggestions is to buy the new Lopez catalogue from the MFA show, and the other less expensive book and you have a comparable resource at way less then a 1/4 of the cost."
2,Disapointing,"I played this long ago. I liked Gauntlet, but this one we did not like at all. I'm sorry, I don't remember why!!"
2,Far too easy to beat,"After hours and hours of fun play with Dark Legacy, my family and I eagerly awaited the release of the next Gauntlet. We were sorely disappointed. With a 4 player team made up of 2 adults, an 11-year-old, and a 7-year-old, we beat the game in 4 hours.Overall play was fun, but the game was far too short. With a 4 player team made up of 2 adults, an 11-year-old, and a 7-year-old, we beat the game in 4 hours.The minions and the bosses were far too easy to beat (this is coming from a mom who isn't a complete video game nut).We are very upset that we paid the full price for this game."
2,Disappointed,"If you're an old school Gauntlet fan and if you're expecting something as good as Dark Legacy then DON'T buy this game. It took me about 7 hours to beat this game. If you're buying it just for the online experience then I guess that it's okay. Nice graphics and nice variety in attacks. However, there are no real puzzles, the levels are extremely short, the bosses are easily defeated, and there is nothing as far as special items. The only good thing that I can say about this game is that I can return it. Very disappointed in Midway Games on this one."
4,An okay game. Not as good as Dark Legacy!,This game is not as good as the previous version: Dark Legacy! I would still buy it if you are a fan of the games but it is a little harder to adjust to if you are accustomed to Dark Legacy.
3,"Decent game, too short","This game is not exactly like the original Gauntlet II for good old NES (one of my all-time favorites). The players all look the same color, and they blend into the enemies at times (hard to figure out which person on the screen is you, especially if you are playing in multi-player mode). Storyline is cheesy and unnecessary. And game ending is not rewarding at all. Game control/special items are cool, but I wish there was more to this game than there was."
2,If you Luv Dark Legacy don't buy this one...here's why,"I was sorely addicted to Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and was eagerly awaiting this one to come out. My husband bought this for me last year for Christmas. Put it in and sadly, while it does rock pretty good while you are playing it and is a bit harder than Dark Legacy, it is really really short, fewer levels, no secret characters. I was completely done in less than four hours. I had beat it before Christmas was even over!!! Whahhhhhh. Just stick to the better Dark Legacy."
1,sorely missed,"I bought this game thinking i was retro back to the 80s, but sadly, i finished the game in about 2-4 hrs myself. completely. i would not recommend this for those who want to have fun at a game. it was too easy"
2,"short, repetitive but fun","this gauntlet is nothing like the other one. it has maybe half as much levels and is too easy or boring at some parts. Me and two friends beat it in like a week then we were done with it and bored. this game is probobly better to rent than to buy. Another thing is that there is only four characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkerie) compared to the other gauntlet with like 50 characters."
1,definitely not worth it!,"I tried this game out and found it to be horrible. The characters are boring and annoying, the graphics are a turn-off, and the storyline is extremely over-melodramatic. After the first intro I wanted to off the emperor myself! Believe me, this game is a waste of money unless you are really hard up for 2 player rpg games and can overlook pretty much 99% of the game just for game play"
3,A Simple review,"The game graphics is good, I'll say 5 times better than the gauntlet dark legacy version. But the game is missing alot of the sound effects.The music for the stages are not as exciting as gauntlet legends ,plus you don't hear the enemies die or the game character morn for pain when hit by an enemy.Its almost like playing a silent game, except for the basic background music.I Think they could of done a better job putting this game together for the ps2.but still will recomend it for gauntlet fans."
1,Don't Bother,"Although the graphics were alot better than Dark Legacy, DL offered much more of a challenge and took more time to play....I, too, beat this game (with one other person) in 5 hours....Rent it, get it as a gift, find it, but by any means, DO NOT BUY IT!! Save your money and hope the next version is better!!"
3,good game,"I like this game but i was hoping that it would be more like the oreginal one ""gauntlet dark legacy"" It is nothing like the 1ast game but it is still a good game."
3,Not that bad,I purchased and it wasn't as bad as the reviews said it was...I did give it three stars only because the game seemed short...most gaunlet games are pretty long....however I still have fun playing this game...me and my three kids...they really enjoyed it...I am wondering if some of the people who played...played easy...or impossible?...cause easy is very easy and maybe they should have tried impossible which was much harder..
4,"Good, but not terrific","This CD is good, but not nearly as lively and lilting as Ms. Richards' Morning Aire. However, if you are looking for slower tempo and more mellow music you will still enjoy this."
5,It's been a favorite for a long time,"I have had the cassette for years. I am now upgrading to a CD. The music is soothing, and helps me concentrate. I have used it for meditation, and it helps me to center. The instrumentation is beautiful. All of the tunes are melodius and traquil. If you need cassette or CD to help you relax and focus, I recommend this music!!!"
2,Good service. The book isn't perfectly.,"The book was recived very fast, but isn't perfect. The lid of the book isn't good, but the pages are correctly.Good service."
4,"O, what a beautiful book!","O, what a beautiful book. Mr. Bradshaw really went out full ""hog"" on this one. I do not know what other book he has written but this one sure hits the spot. Bradshaw discusses the world and life that he led in the deep south which highly influenced his adulthood. While the book touches on some areas that many of us may not relate to, it does ring out enough familarity to make a believer out of you. Bradshaw, no doubt, operates with a lot of spirituality, therefore, that spirit is expressed throughout the pages of his book.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in finding out how to insure that one's spirituality is reflected in everything one does."
2,Waste of time,"I may be in the minority but I thought this was one of the weakest movies Esther Williams or Howard Keel ever made. I had wanted to see this film for a long time since I like Esther Williams, Howard Keel and the Champions. I saw it last night on TCM. What a let down. Not one good, memorable song, no real story and even the dance numbers were uninspired. This could have been a real killer of a movie but it just sort of puttered along on two cylinders, not good enough to be enjoyable but not quite bad enough to say the heck with it and give up. Esther's fantasy swimming number with the living statues is the high point. Howard Keel has no song worthy of his talent and the Champion's dance number with the elephants goes on way too long. I know that this was made at the end of the ""Musical"" era but it should have been titled ""The Fall of the MGM Empire"". The fact that this film has not been released on DVD says a bunch."
1,boring,"I had a tough time staying awake for this one.There was one underwater scene that was probably the best segment of this drawn out spoof. Sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy."
5,An Enchanting Take On An Old Story!,"Jupiter's Darling is yet another five star performance for singer/actor Howard Keel. In this tale Keel plays Hannibal(the conqueror)with the usual, but not gruesome, war tales. The twist is that Hannibel falls in love with a beautiful Roman girl, Ester Williams before he can burn Rome. The music is gorgeous and the costumes are amazing. This is one of both Keel and William's finest performances. Five Golden Stars!"
4,One of the best of the Williams Musicals,"Why, oh WHY isn't this musical on DVD? I thought for sure TCM would include it in the second volume of the Esther Williams genre. It's got the strongest script this side of ""Dangerous When Wet"" and more sex appeal than the code allowed at the time. The production's gorgeous, it's got the Champions, and some fine underwater photography. It's funny, it's sexy, it's delightful...and it's still not on DVD."
4,National Geographinc the wild side,"I found this video very knowledgeable and entertaining. I used it to teach a crash course on cetacean behavior to children grades 8-12 and they found it very enjoyable. It is filled with many interesting facts and great photography. It emphasizes the fact that although some cetacean species are ""playful"" they are wild animals and will react it ways necessary to their society. I would recommmend it to anyone."
5,Wow.,"This book owned my attention from the moment I started it. Everything about it just captivated me: the strong cast of characters, the unforgiving world and especially the concept of how the Takers came about and what they meant to Oz. I have since read through to the end of the fourth book and I believe that this series is well worth the attention of anyone who loves a good apocalypse."
4,"Stephen King? Yeah, I can see that","I agree with the comparisons other reviews have made between The Takers and both Stephen King and The Wizard of Oz. The Talisman is the closest parallel I can see. This book has some really surreal stuff. It also reminds me quite a bit of the zombie genre in that the monsters are everywhere out there and could show up at any moment while you're trying to load up on supplies.I'll just go ahead and admit it's scary as hell and be done with it. The sequel is on my to-do list just as soon as I stop having these pesky nightmares. Seriously, though, it's 225-ish pages of awesome horror-fantasy for a buck. Gift it to the Kindle owner in your life who is sleeping just a little too soundly at night. Some nightmares are worth sharing with the ones you love."
5,Ann Young in Tn.,"This is not the type of book I usually read BUT I loved it! The Takers is a very well organized, superbly developed story that will appeal to all ages. I didn't want to put the book down before I discovered what was going to happen to Oz and his band of ""Warriors"". Author Richard Ridley was able to keep the suspense tight for the entire novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to volume two."
5,TAKEN,"The Takers grabs your attention from the first chapter and never lets go! Great story about a misfit band of warriors who embark upon a seemingly impossible mission. Will they succeed??? The suspense forces you to keep reading. Great book, can't wait for the sequel."
3,surprised me,I wanted to try out the kindle app on my phone and was looking through the kindle store when The Takers caught my attention and I thought I'd give it a try. I was so curious as to how Oz was going to get himself out of each situation I could not stop reading and ended up purchasing the entire series. All of the books were good and even a little scary. There were a few weird errors in The Takers as well as the other books in the series like sentences being repeated or not making sense at times but I assumed it was just the result of the book being in electronic form?? Everything was great apart from that :)
3,Stop before the end.,"I enjoyed this book until the last scene. If it had ended before the last scene I probably would get book two. So maybe I should be happy that it ended where it did. I won't be getting book two.I like the apocalyptic world that was created. I like that things dovetailed when they needed to since I knew that was the kind of book I was reading.The book became more juvenile near the end. Before then, it was a good book about a young protagonist who had to lead.The sacrifice by many of the characters was distorted by the ending."
1,Barely readable printing,"This is a fabulous book. However, this EDITION is so poorly printed that you can barely read much of the text, particularly the printing in the gray boxes. We ordered this book based on the book we checked out of the library which is excellent. I ordered the book for Christmas but apparently too far ahead of time to return it. I saw the cover was good but didn't go through the book the way my daughter did. Ugly. And apparently too late to return it or get it replaced. But it is the only edition available from Amazon."
2,Disappointing,This book was disappointing in its lack of detail. It doesn't really get into much depth on any topic and I just didn't learn anything from it.
3,Great format but limited scope,"This is a great format for kids learning to use a thesaurus. However, out of 11 spelling words last week for my 1st grader, not one of the words was in there. On other weeks we have been just barely able to find 5 out of the 11. Very frustrating for an assignment to look up 5 words in a thesaurus. It would be better served if it could be expanded to about double the number of words included."
1,Safety Issues,"This product is made to try and give your guinea pig some exercise, but it actually is quite harmful to them. The slates they use for airflow and to let liquid waste escape not only makes a mess by spreading urine, but it keeps the pellets(poo) inside so the pig walks and sits in their mess. The most worrisome of the product are those slats are just big enough for your pig to get a toy stuck and broke. It really is not a good type of toy for a guinea pig. There is an old plastic child's wadding pool which gives them lots of room to run or any of the small 'play pen' type products on the site which can be put away cleanly when your pig is running. A good rule of thumb to go by is that if you were to give the toy to your young baby to play with, it should be ok for a guinea pig since they have (almpost) removed the most harmful parts. Even with the guinea pig ball I believe that a small baby could get their fingers stuck and it would be harmful to remove them."
3,Color,"It's just fine but I suggest a clear ball because the red color makes it hard to see through and after a while can make them dizzy, just like if a human was looking through red sunglasses."
1,Dangerous product for intended pet!,This is a dangerous product for guinea pigs! Their spines are not flexible and they can be seriously harmed by so-called exercise balls. Shame on Super Pet for marketing a product which is dangerous for the very creature for which it is marketed.
1,"Dangerous, as others have stated","Guinea pigs do not have flexible spines like rats, mice, etc. Using a ball, or an exercise wheel, could easily result in serious injury. What guinea pigs need is flat space to run. For more information do a search for cube and coroplast cages."
1,She just sits there,"I thought our guinea pig would like to get out of her cage and run around. She doesn't move in it (she literally sits in one spot seemingly afraid), she doesn't explore, she doesn't seem to enjoy it. It is a bit disappointing. Maybe other small animals will enjoy it, but not our pig."
2,Quality isn't Great,"The ferrets love it. However, I was dissappointed in the quality. On both ends where the caps come off to put your critter in were broken. I have to duct tape both ends for it to work, otherwise the tabs don't stay. I would have sent it back, but I need something right then and there to be able to confine my two fuzzies."
1,Not for guinea pigs,"Guinea pigs are not made for these, their spines aren't flexible enough. The same goes for exercise wheels, they aren't for guinea pigs."
3,"Interesting,but heavy.","Ms.Pavord certainly does love her tulips - the narrative is strewn with latin names for every variety of tulip.Originally from the middle-east and very different to most other flowers, the discovery of strange multi-coloured hybrids that appeared spontaneously kept nurserymen occupied for years looking for the perfect specimen. This led to an outrageous inflation in the price, people selling their homes to buy one bulb!Written in a style that fails to hold one's attention, there is perhaps a tad more botanical detail than is necessary for the layman, but when one considers that this is the second book - a corollary to a scholarly exercise - on tulips, it is surprising that so little jargon is used.Very informative though lacking in story-telling. ***."
2,"A simply beautiful coffee table book and alas, quite dull !","The packaging of this volume is simply beautiful as are the lavish illustrations. However,the book which promises a facinating tale is in truth quite dull. Anna Pavord is simply too carried away with the botanty of her subject and gives just a glimpse into the human maelstrom that surrounded the tulip. More story telling and 'human interest' anecdotes would have been appreciated."
1,Don't believe the reviews!,"Sadly, there is a real trend in this country for reviewers to fall for a PR's hype and laud a book that just isn't anywhere near as good as the author and the publisher would like us to believe. The Tulip is a prime example of this phenomenon. I must have read four or five reviews of the book before I bought it, and they were all gushing in their praise for The Tulip and for Anna Pavord. Sadly, neither is remotely worth it. This volume is over-written, over-priced and over-long. Do yourself a favour. Don't fall for the hype and don't waste your money on the Tulip."
1,"Oh, dear. A decorator's book...","read the reviews and thought I would love this book but, ohmygod, yawn, this is the sort of book that decorators (and only decorators) enthuse about. Text is really badly written, nice pictures - yes, nice pictures - but that's about it. Can't help feeling that Ms Pavord needed a good editor to take her in hand and help sort out the mind-numbingly dull prose style. But, yes, there were also bits I liked (Turkish stuff was ok and the virus/breaking stuff was ok) but... etc"
4,FASCINATING,"A wonderful book. I got it from the library and read it very quickly - now I am buying it. There is a very good balance between the various sections - mercifully the Dutch tulip mania is not more than 50 pages or so - all info on that bubble is available in Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crrowds (Mackay). One is given sufficient information on the various historical aspects without going into too many details. The focus of the book is, after all, the tulip. The illustrations are perfect - excellent colour reproduction (amazing that it can be done for such a low price) and the list of cultivars at the end of the book is fascinating - particularly to a non-gardener such as myself."
4,In Love with a Flower,"I was seduced by the tulip when as an eight-year old I saw my first in Srinagar. Do any remain there today? My love deepened when botany taught me how unique the tulip really was. Its gorgeous variegated colours are produced by a tiny parasite, an aphid, that weakens the plant but renders the bloom glorious. Anne Pavord narrates the history of the tulip like a love story. And it is one, from its origin as a wild flower of the Asian steppes to its adoption by the Ottomans of Istanbul, to its 17th century arrival in the west and the subsequent tulipmania that gripped Europe, to the auction in Holland in February 1637 when 99 lots of tulip bulbs fetched 90,000 guilders ( more than US $12 million of today ). This extraordinary, lavishly illustrated book compells me to restate my desire -- to be laid to rest in Keukenhoff outside Amsterdam."
2,Not an easy read,"I found this book frustrating to read...it is a collection of interesting historical anecdotes strung together like an assembly of mis-sorted beads. Each one of them might stand alone as an essay but the author seems to be lacking the craft or will to force them together into an entertaining narrative.My experience trying to read this was like being dragged to the opera--at first I was seduced by the pageantry and vivid colors, but eventually I grew bored and wished it would end. Read one chapter of this book and you may like it, but it takes real will and focus to make it to the end."
1,The real mystery is...,"The strangest thing about this book is the bit on the jacket where it says Anna Pavord makes her living as a journalist. The real mystery here isn't the puzzle of what caused the Dutch tulip mania (a genuinely enticing subject that Pavord somehow manages to render yawn-inducing), but who on earth would employ a woman with the world's most tedious prose style as a writer. Stick to the gardening, Ms Pavord, and leave writing books to people who are properly qualifed to do it!!"
1,the topic seemed so interesting...,"I could not finish this book, and I thought it would be right up my alley. It was a sort of a mix of anecdotes and history. Personally I could have done without the anecdotes."
1,OLD PRODUCT,"Warning: This is an old product made in 1996, it only has a new label glued on top of the box indicating it is XP/Vista compatible. I noticed immediately after installing it that it has a very dated look to the interface, like playing MYST.I suppose it's subjective, but in my opinion it should have been marketed for $10; certainly not $30."
5,The hits keep coming,"James Patterson keeps the hits coming with another ""Just one more chapter, I swear!"" page-turner installment of the runaways of the Angel Experiment. In order to fully appreciate this book, it's best to read it only after having read ""Maximum Ride - The Angel Experiment,"" as you will find the racing action and astounding powers of these kids quite mind-boggling. Still on the run from The School, Max and her 5 friends run into what seems like more than they can handle. How will they ever hold it together?"
5,Schools out forever,Awesome!!!!!!!!! I loved the book a lot I am going to read the whole series and so on :p t
3,Come along for the Ride,"This is touted as a book for young adults. I'm an adult who enjoyed it. In fact it's more interesting than some of Patterson's ""adult"" fiction. Only complaint is that it ends in the middle of an unfolding plot. I guess that means we can expect more in this avian vein."
3,Maximin Ride,"I am a huge Patterson fan, but thought this one was way beneath his standards.....A talking dog???? Just a bit to farfetched for me. I will continue with Mr. Patterson, however because, I usually finish his books in one day...."
3,"This one's OK, but the final in the series is lousy - beware!","I recognize that this book is written for a younger audience, but I thoroughly enjoyed both #1 & this one in the series. However, when I read the third one I was completely disappointed. I really wish I had never gotten started. I'm rating this with 2 stars even though I enjoyed the book because it is part of a series and the conclusion to the series was so lousy I would have wanted to know ahead of time...NOTE: My rating is due to the conclusion of the series and not this specific book. I'm not saying I didn't like how the author chose to end it - I'm saying that the last book doesn't tie up loose ends and as such leaves you with a ""where's the last 50 pages?"" feel...If you're interested in why I disliked #3 so much just click the ""see all my reviews"" button and look for my review of that book."
4,Wild Ride,"I had a hard time in putting the book down, but with the way it ended I would like to see another book."
4,If you liked the first book you will like this one.,"I liked this book it went more into detail about the flock and max but I am still itching for more. I want to know more about max and the mystery where she's from, whos her parents, and how shes supossed to save the world, ect... I liked this book alot but it keeps you longing for more,more,more!!!"
4,Fight and Flight,"The generic fight or flight response to danger takes on new meaning in this thrilling sequel. The fight or flight becomes fight and flight as the six bird kids continue to flee from the white coats and the dreaded mutant Erasers led by Ari. Comforts of home are few and far bewteen for these teens and preteens as they try to fulfill theri destiny and avoid termination.George O. Love, Author of On the Scene, On the Scene II; Status Check and One the Scene III; Busy on Call"
2,What happened??,"This is the first and only book of the series I'll read. At first it was like ""The lake House"" or ""When the Wind Blows"", those were books. Then the story went completely out of everything, for instance: from where the flock had money to eat? To crash on an hotel? To ride a car without gas? Be aware I'm not talking about Disney World because they entered there flying. So what an example to the kids this book was written for? To enter to a theme park for free? Not paying for what you'll use? You'll teach that to your children? I'm definitely not."
4,Better than the first,"The second installment in the Maximum Ride series allows for the characters to grow in a way that wasn't possible in the first. While other reviewers are dissapointed in the lack of beginning-middle-end type of storytelling, it was nice to see these kids get a chance to truly be kids for a while, even if it means they go to school and have Thanksgiving dinner with a shady FBI agent. While this hold over in Virginia doesn't make for the most exciting read, it gives these hard running, hard fighting kids a chance to regain their bearings and focus on the hunt for their birth parents. This was a fast fun read."
3,When will the series end?,"I love the premise behind the books, but the first two make it very clear that Patterson plans to make this a series. Each book in a series should be able to stand on its own. ""School's Out"" repeats a great deal of information that we learned in the first book to the point that I wanted to shout, ""Yes, I know Max is supposed to save the world; Yes, I know the kids are able to stand together against all odds, etc."" I wanted a plot that had an ending. Even if the story line continues to the next book in the series, each book should have a definite focus and some kind of resolution at the end (even if it is incomplete.)I love Max, Fang and the rest of the gang. They are great characters. I just felt that something was missing."
2,SCHOOLS OUT,"Max series kids books only,no when the wind blowesor Lake House in the Max series,When the Wind Blowesand The Lake House were great books,adults wouldenjoy"
3,POOR SHIPPING,"SELLER TOOK FOREVER TO EVEN NOTIFY AMAZON THAT THEY RECEIVED THE ORDER, AND TOOKL A VERY LONG TIME TO SHIP..."
1,Schools out forever,done with Max. and the ghost writer that wrote this for patterson needs to try something new for a career
2,What's up with STILL looking for the parents,"This installment is definitely not written as well as the previous three books. What was most annoying was the fact that the central issue for the flock is finding their REAL parents. Uhm..didn't that alread happen in Lake House? This annoying story line was almost as bad as the predictability of the plot. I think Mr. Patterson was just in a rush to get this book on the shelf for when ""school was out."""
1,how to ruin a good book,this is a good story and a fun book except the end. the author inserted his own political views about global warming. he ruin the book.
2,Deceiving,"I shouldn't have read the book when I read the disclaimer in the beginning that explains that these kids are not the 'originial' Max and the gang. WHY in god's name then write such a similar book; even having a blind kid in the mix. I already loved the first crew and those two books. If going to write anything why not a continuation of their adventures. If had hadn't read the first books then I might have enjoyed this - it is not like it was poorly written, howeve, I have room only for the originals."
3,Great - until:,"I loved the first book in this series. The plot was good (I thought it was complex; I don't know about you), but maybe a half-star off because of its overall unoriginality. I was kind of struggling to enjoy this book... call me ridiculous, but I had to stop reading because of Fang.Fang is like a character straight out of a horribly bad fanfiction. Good looking, awesome, powerful, awesome, popular with girls, tall-and-dark-super-overratedly-popular type, handsome, Mr. Cool, awesome. Blah blah blah... okay, I got so tired of him, I ditched the series. The 6th book is even called Fang, I think, and it seems as if the whole series revolves around him. He's obviously Patterson's favorite character; it's glaringly obvious. Please get rid of Fang, erase him from our minds, and I will gladly read this otherwise pretty good series."
5,Love the Maximum Ride,Borrowed the first book from the library. So good bought the second and now buying the third. Love the flocks adventures and triumphs Max and her flock are an awsome butt kicking group.
4,Maximum Ride (2),This is an easy read. I love this series. James Patterson has been one of my favorites for years and I'll keep reading anything he writes.
4,MAXIMUM RIDE SCHOOL'S OUT FOREVER,it was really good but not the best book ive read. I definately recommend this book for teens that like science fiction with adventures mixed!!!!!! GREAT JOB JAMES PATTERSON!!!!!
3,Why Kindle Edition More than the Paperback?,"I really enjoy the Maximum Ride Series. But, I would like to know why the Kindle Edition of this book is more expensive than the paperback edition. Let's save some trees and let the books be competitively priced. Why gouge us on an electronic version? Any thoughts?"
5,best book,"james pattson has done it again. the first one was great and this one is great 2. after i read the rest of the books, i going to read witch and wizard. go james pattson!"
5,I HAVE NEVER Read This BOOK BEFORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@!,i can't read this book or any other maximum ride books. the reason is i have no money on my kindle to get it. i hear it good and bad. is it agood or bad book? from: Lightingfang p.s if you don't like this book read warrior cats erin hunter.
1,Disappointing,"Not as well written as previous books. Wait until you can read it for free at your library, don't waste your money."
1,Concentrate on Alex Cross or the Murder Club,"This novel is definitely ""different"" than the other novels. What make Patterson's books so enthralling is the fact that once your get into the book (normally after the first page), the world almost goes on hold until you have lived thru the novel, solved the case, etc. With this book, I kept searching for Patterson's normal style & the usual plot that is so engrossing I usually forget to stop reading long enough to eat, sleep, etc. This timeit didn't happen & I am disappointed.Please stick to your most popular characters; Alex & the Club. You will certainly never run out of plot ideas, just watch the news."
3,Poor Ride,"Not as good as ""The Lake House"" et.al. The repetitious entrapments by the ""Erasers"" got so tiresome that I never finished the book."
1,OUTRAGEOUS! The worst book I have ever read!,"I will never, EVER read this book again, and let me tell you why. First off, it was extremely insulting! It was an adult author trying to write children's books. That's like Michaelangelo trying to train dogs how to paint! Second, he ""edits"" his book so well that not a single bad word is in it. Whhat?! He has ""insert the word of your choice"" instead of another ""bad word""! I mean, COME ON! Use a frikin bad word! Also, the story was so cheesy to the point that it was almost unbelievebly unrealistic! You have flying people with wings that are afraid of docters who hire men that turn into bears that want to kill them! I se MANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT! Anyways, everyone hates this book! You should TOO!"
2,"Talking Dogs, Bird Kids, and Morphing Wolf Boys?","Which of these three things is the worst idea James Patterson ever devised for a plot, and I'm referring to either juvenile or adult fiction? This book makes Hide and Seek look like a Dickens novel, and that's really saying something if you know how poor that story is. At least it HAD a story. I've read good teen books but this, sadly, is not one of them. There is nothing but violence, kids defying authority, and cleaned up name calling with no value for a young person to learn from at all. True, this is the first juvenile fiction I have read by Patterson, but this one alone proves he's out of his league. As another reviewer said, he should stick to Alex Cross and the Women's Murder Club. He's not even up to the challenge of old S.E. Hinton novels."
5,very soft..very pleased!,Very soft sheets as all the reviews have promised..cotton..made in India. I was very glad that these sheets were not thin or rough. Fit portable mattress nicely and have washed well. Great price too!
1,Waste of time & money,"The book is full of useless fillings. Finding your colors is limited to few hair and eye color combinations. It also depends on you doing a test with different colored fabrics & determing how the color reflect against your skin. After reading the book, I still don't know what my colors are. Besides, with so many different color hues on the market, how can one tell if what you're buying is an ever green or true green for example, confusing. The lack of pictures showing the types of collars they're recommending for different body types (e.g Mandarincollar,cowl,bardot...)...is annoying,to say the least. Questionnaires are poorly structured, & the section on makeup, underwear & accessories is trivial. Save your money (i'm glad the book I read was a borrow from the library) and save your time. Pass."
4,Quite Helpful,"While very helpful about many coloring aspects, it's still rather confusing in the explanation of secondary characteristics or classifications: Soft + Warm vs Soft + Cool. But my teenager and I are learning a lot with this helpful fashion tool."
4,Fantastic Coloring Booking,"I have 4 Color me Beautiful books and this one is a favorite. I bought this book for my 25 year old daughter who ...as a resident of Seattle ...wears only black and grey (seems to be the uniform in Seattle). It has some great ideas on styles to wear that flatter the figure. Teaching her to go ""against fashion trends"" and wear the styles that flatter her hourglass figure is helpful to her. I would buy this book again."
5,Excelent!!!,"This book is def a must have for all women!Not only teaches u to pick the right colors to wear, but tells u too what kind of clothes looks good on your body shape and teaches u how to use makeup to improve your best features... I loved it! :)"
4,From spookiness to reality.,"The trilogy just stunned me and I worked at trying to understand its complexities. Then I read this book, and everything made sense. At first I declared that the trilogy was better than 'The Lord of the Rings' but could not explain why. This book nails it. It will be wonderful if you read the trilogy, read this book, and share everything with your children. Remember when 'expanding your consciousness' was all the rage? No? That's OK. All these books do it with a basis in science. Buy the darn books. Buy them for your friends."
2,Not what I had hoped,"I can see how this book would be interesting to some people, but for me it was just not worth struggling through. There are two problems with this book for me: 1) I'm not that into Philip Pullman and 2) I'm not that into science. I suppose I shouldn't have bothered to pick this book because of those two reasons, but it came highly recommended by friends. I found that if you are not thoroughly into Philip Pullman then you tend to be a little lost at times. There are parts that you have to know from reading his books. They don't give you much of explaining the book parts that they are using when talking about the science. The science part was very interesting. The theories were talked about in depth. It would be fascinating to someone that cared about that sort of thing. I'm just not that type of person."
5,Filled the bill,"I was interested a microfiber pillow and found this one by searching Amazon. It is everything the product description says it is. I am a side sleeper and all my pillow research said I needed a firm pillow. Tried one, no way. I've had this one for a month now and am well satisfied."
4,Excellent,"As a student of Chakrabarti, I've got to say that this book was extremely enlightening. Not only does he offer very sound proofs for psycho-physical dualism, but he also offers refutations of Cartesian and Materialist views. His proofs are very simple and worded in ways that a layman can understand."
3,I was disappointed,"After reading about this film on Amazon.com.UK and in music periodical reviews I was excited to get it at home. When I finally acquired this -- it has only been available in USA a relatively short time -- I was quite disappointed compared to the hype I'd seen over this film.Perhaps I expected more than what was delivered, which is essentially a practice of the ""Eroica"" symphony before a group of benefactors and others, as well as a performance of the symphony by Gardiner and his period band. The performance is pretty good although quite fast.The period costumes and acting, what there is of it, is good. However, there isn't really much about Beethoven in this movie that I can see. I was hoping it would be an update over the dreadful ""Immortal Beloved"" of two decades back but it deals with one moment in Beethoven's life and is, in reality, mostly a music video."
5,Entirely unique,"Just to let you know where I am coming from. I am not particularly a Beethoven fan.This movie which includes a complete playing of the 3rd Symphony is intended to put that piece in general and musical historical context. It accomplishes that goal in a startlingly unique and entertaining way. There is no other movie quite like this one.The reactions of every one from scullery maids to princes are expressed non-verbally. Not all are entirely approving. By necessity the acting is subtly nuanced. The social system of the time is displayed in microcosm. The politics of non-French Napoleonic Europe are hinted at, and Beethoven is placed in the center of it. The whole is really ... quite moving. The essence is finally captured by Hayden when he comments after the performance, ""From this day forward, everything is changed."" And indeed so it was.(PS: if you like rock music or the movie ""Amadeus"", don't bother. You won't like this.)"
5,This is what you've been looking for...,"...if you're tired of the same old thing. This book is a simple, cool, straighforward breath of fresh air. I just read some of this reviews and it's clear that some of these folks just don't get it. If you are an academic type who likes long ornate descriptions and, well, pretentious attempts at emotional depth, then perhaps you won't like ""Dogwlaker"". This book is the antidote to all that, really. The stories have good plots! Strange and beautiful! It's an easy, fun read, in the best sense of the word. I've been reccomending ""Dogwlaker"" to my friends for months and some have said, ""huh?"" while others are delighted. Check it out and see what side of the fence you're on."
2,Ok &#65533; if you like grotesque humor with simple dialogue&#65533;,"Mr. Bradford has put together a collection of disgusting stories aimed, I'm assuming, to shock and amuse. Shocking yes, but not remotely amusing is the story about a man who has a meaningful sexual relationship with his girlfriend's dog, which results in the dog giving birth to mutant puppies/humans. These stories were mind-numbing and seemed to drag on forever. Not worth the time spent reading it, or the money paid for it. If you are that curious... wait for paperback."
4,A Good Summer Book....,"I really enjoyed this book. The characters are quirky and funny, it is filled with humor, and it's very original. I recommend it to people who find humor in the offbeat things in life."
1,no no no,This was a mess guys if you were not already confused you will be with maxium test anxiety. It was so weird that a classmate gave it away to me and I gave it right back to her. I don't actually know if it is the format or wording/questions or both. I think we future nurses can do better like the NSNA RN review or the lippincott's Review thanks. The only reason I gave this a 1 is because they are the makers of our nursing drug book which is excellent.
2,Worked great for a year!,"I loved this all-in-one for the year that it worked. It printed great, scanned fast, and faxed nicely. After about 13 months it started getting scanner failure errors and would scan anything. The 950xi just kept saying it was warming up but nothing would ever happen. I contacted HP support and there only answer to this problem was to reset the unit every time I wanted to scan or fax. Resetting it worked some of the time but then that stopped working and now I have a multifunction printer that prints only. I did research on the net and found that this is a common problem with the scanner bulb and to get it fixed it would be around $200. I would rather spend another $100 and get a new cannon malfunction printer."
4,Dependable Small Office Workhorse,"I had this printer for several years and found it to be dependable and inexpensive to maintain. I am a heavy user, including printing technical manuals from it more than pictures. I now have a Dell 948 and I am missing how well the HP managed the ink because the Dell is comparatively very thirsty. HPs inks are easy to find as well and was usually satisfied with a stop in an isle while getting groceries at my local Sam's Club. The only reason for the Dell was that it had the multipage feeder for the scanner/copier. This makes it much easier scanning in all my receipts every week. My soon to be Mother in Law has the HP and it is still going strong. At the time there was not a networking option for this and I basically shared it off of my desktop to use it on the network. Keep up the good work HP. I am now searching for another one to replace this new Dell, at least for B/W printing of documents and manuals."
1,look elsewhere,"I have had this thing for 3-4 years....nothing but problems....it is essentailly worthless at this point as it will not fax, print without it's own very specific & expensive cart or scan. I get constant errors for everything I try to do. Yes the drivers are UTD & I've even reinstalled the. I will be looking for another brand asap. It worked fine for the first eyar or so, then all this started. Good luck trying to get someone to actually fix it."
1,"Excellent Stand Alone Machine, but NOT for Macs. Not at all","It claimed it could be used on Macs, and itself is an excellent stand alone machine, but.....The software for both Mac 9 and X is extremely worthless. I bought it half year and I still can only use it as a stand alone copier. Even the newest software from HP cannot get it to work on my OS 9. Very disppointed. Even writing several times to the customer service, the answer is: ""there maybe something wrong with your software."" Poor support for Macs.HP is very good at hardware, but when it comes to software for Macs, ...[it's bad]. I have a 1200 in office and the software for Mac is also having problem. I suggest HP abandon its support for Macs and it is better off than claiming its support but actually there is no support at all.If you own a Mac, do not buy this kind of printer."
4,Good adapter,"Works great, it would've been nice to see the whole length of the cable sleeved/insulated though. I might pick up another."
5,good cable,"good cable for the money did just what i needed it for, good price sturdy cable if i need another i will buy again!"
4,Works great (with some modification),"The cabled worked great for my application, although the insulation they use is pretty thick and the cable pretty short. Although most won't need to do this, I stripped the insulating plastic, and the big bulky black plastic around the USB head, allowing me to make it flexible and streamline."
4,Lovely classical music.,If you like a good quartet sounding classical music cd then this is a good one to start off w/.This is good for early mornings during the Autumn & Winter Season as well as the late afternoons & evenings.Very quaint & perky.
4,Soothing,"From the samples that I have heard, I love this music and I have never been a Celtic fan before."
3,"Ambitious, but flawed","I had the highest of high hopes for this book, but was disappointed to see a bunch of Old West characters straight from Central Casting, including such worthies as the Snake Oil Salesman and the Town Drunk, each with their usual motivations. I must admit that I stalled about 2/3 or the way through it. Now I'm picking it back up again.Certainly, the scope of the story deserves a lot of credit; it's damned hard to orchestrate a sprawling, multiple-viewpoint novel, and Somtow made a valiant effort. I was really pulling for this story to move me as it has so many reviewers and readers, but when I began predicting what each of the characters would do, my interest waned. I would have liked a new vision of The West, but I just got the same old thing, only with werewolves.More effective were the ""present-tense"" events, which were claustrophobic and unsettling. However, the Old West sequences, which dominated the book, began to be hackneyed and predictable, which killed my interest."
2,Werewolves? More like Poodle-beasts!,"I have read thousands of horror books and hundreds of ""werewolf"" novels in one fashion or another. But Moon Dance was by far and away the worst I have ever read. The only reason I ended up reading the entire book was to see if Somtow tied up his mass of loose threads. I will give him that,he did tie up most if not all of them. But getting to the end of that book was a feat indeed. I was never so pleased to be done with book as I was with Moon Dance. Thank god I had ""the Relic"" waiting for me to start."
1,Moon Makes Reader Wan,"I bought Moon Dance because some reviews I read were five-star. After reading several pages, it was obvious that those who gave this book five stars do not read much! After meeting a certain psychologist in Vienna early on I knew the remainder of the book was downhill. The author saturated the reader with as many 19th Century well-knowns as possible--one knows there're too many historical characters being served up when one runs into Chester Arthur (Who? I hear you say.)! The dialogue was stilted and the characters, even the werewolves, were one-dimensional. The author trivialized at every opportunity the characters, the plot and the theme. There was blood and violence galore and galore, and galore. Moon Dance was a horror novel all right--absolutely horrific to read. The author must have howled his way to the bank!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This is a werewolf story, set in the 'old west' of the United States. The werewolves involved, though, are a bunch of Europeans.Looking for a boy that is the son of a count, the European werewolves do not bargain for the Lakota, who have wolf shapeshifting abilities of their own. A chase and some chomping happen."
4,Shaky Start- strong finish,"Sometimes rambling, but I found myself riveted by about the halfway point- As one reviewer said 'The Gone With the Wind"" of werewolf novels- that turns out to be true, as a positive statement and as a negative critique.Myself not being a fan of gratuitous sex and violence, I was impressed how the author used these elements to great effect- They kept the novel from being a stolid and boring ""Twilight"" type take on the nasty business of werewolves. Touche!"
2,over the top,"From the outset, I enjoyed the book. Historical fiction wrapped up in elements of the horror genre (or perhaps vice versa). By the third part of the book, I was tired of it all, and was reading it just to complete it. Although the decription ""epic"" is probably incorrect, Moon Dance is certainly comprehensive, but only because everything was taken past the point of 'useful' into the realm of 'repetitive'. The consistently brutal violence and visceral imagery techniques make compelling reading if used sparingly, but overused they sledgehammer the reader with the less essential elements of the story. There were a number of battles, though none were particularly interesting, and a volume of characters who were typically flat and uninvolved. Why is it there were there no Lakota characters from the Shungmanitu? I left the book with the impression that the Native Americans were enlightened saints, the pioneers largely perverse psychopaths."
1,eMachine users beware,"Although my new eMachine claims to have Windows XP, and the software box says it will partition XP, allowing for example w98 for a 2nd OS, the hard drive was not partitioned, The ""instructions"" in the rather large owner's manual were way over my head. Maybe the fact that some of the eMachine XP is permanently installed had something to do with the problem. Anyway I'm out the bucks and Fry's says ""tough"", though the eMachine was also their product."
2,"Works most of the time, but.....","The several times I used it, Partition Magic worked fine. Then last month it died in the middle -- leaving a 30 gig partition invisible.I called tech support, only to discover that I couldn't speak to a tech person unless I bought a new copy. You may think you're buying a licensed copy of Partition Magic, but according to the support person I spoke to, you will get no support six months after the next version comes out.Could tech support have recovered the partition that Partition Magic trashed? I had no way to find out without buying a new copy of the program. And that I wasn't willing to do."
2,beware with win XP,"as a previous owner of PM 4.0 which i had used numerous times with various operating systems and computers, i found the initial offer to be quite inviting. however, in a footnote of appendix a / pg 108, it tells you that you must run partion magic from the rescue diskettes if you have norton system works installed...this was the kiss of death for me. it's been a month since my purchase and i still don't have my system rebuilt and working the way i want to too. ugh !!!"
5,"Indespensible Product,,,,BUT","Partition Magic has always been a must have and still is, even more so with XP support, BUT...having to get a different version for NT/Win2k/XP server support is rediculous! There is no reason that this would be necessary (other than $). Get it, but be aware that it won't work on any server versions."
3,good,"It's a decent unit, and cobra is a great company, but there is much better. The midland 1001z is much better built and has much better sound quality and features."
4,Sound,"THE MIC. You need to speak relatively close to it to be able to get the full effect and it sounds a bit muffled if you don't speak distinctively and too close. Like a Golf club there is a ""sweet spot"" you need to speak from for it to come out clear .or it could be just me.Its nice tho i love it!"
2,Cobra 19 DX IV stinks !!,"This is probably the worst radio that Cobra has ever put their name on, I dought if it is infact a real Cobra, the reception is lousy. if your not close then it won't get out. you turn the radio off then back on it goes to channel 01, you have to re adjust your channel everytime you turn it on, I paid 37.00 plus tax and feel that I got screwed. I'm considering taking it to a pawn shop and hopefully they will give me at least part of what I paid for it. I hate it !!! if I had it to do over would I have purchased it ?? HELL NO !!!!!!! IT'S JUNK !!!!!!"
2,Small radio with lots of annoyances.,"I bought the Cobra 19 DX IV for my wife's car since we needed a small radio without bells and whistles.This radio appeared to be a perfect fit for my needs. But, after using it, I am disappointed with this radio. Here's why:1. Unit resets to channel 01 when it loses power. So either wire it directly to the battery (and remember to turn it off!) or wire it to accessory power and work channel 01 every time you start the car.2. ""Poppy"" squelch. When a weak signal breaks the squelch then fades, the squelch makes an annoying popping sound as it squelches the audio.3. S/RF meter shows nothing (drops to zero) when squelch activates. If the squelch is set fairly high, the meter shows no signal until someone manages to break the squelch. I personally think the meter should show all RF activity whether the squelch is on or off.Hope this helps someone."
1,Defective unit or just get what you pay for??,"I bought this radio and brought it to Brazil where I tested it with a 13.8VDC power supply rated at 20A continuos. While overloading my power supply it was putting out no more than 1 W, regardless of SWR (I tested with an antenna tuner at 1.1:1 and bypassing the tuner at 2:1 with similar results).Inittially, it would just lit the overload led at the power supply. In a few minutes it made the power supply protection circuit shut it down.I disconnected the Cobra (CB) and connected a Yaesu and trasnmitted for 3 minutes at 75W FM (2 meters) and the power supply was just happy, no signals of overload, just the expected heat.I wonder if this was just a defective unit that passed through quality control or if this is what you can expect from this product/price??I would not bother trying to return it to Amazon since shipping from Brazil back to the US would not be worth it.. lost money and learned a lesson, the hard way."
3,Good small radio,"I got this radio because I wanted a small cheap cb. I pared this with a cobra HG1500 antenna and cobra HG M75. The SWR are 1 from ch1 to ch40. After tunning the radio and mic it will cover 5 miles in the city so not bad, reports come back clean. The stock mic is ""staticy"". For a small $40 cb if u spend the time to do some work to it you wont be dissapointed but dont expect to get out 20 miles on it."
2,Low Power,Cannot transmit more than a mile. I can here everyone else but no one can here me. Also after powering off and back on the unit does remember what channel you were on. Microphone is very large and uncomfortable to hold for more than a minute. nope I think i will toss it and get somthing else.
3,BAD DISPLAY,"This radio has good receiption, but display screen sucks, bright on both ends of display but dark in the middle,i sent it back to Cobra for this problem and they returned it saying their was nothing wrong with the display screen, can't beleive Cobra thinks the display looks ok."
4,Cobra C19DX IV,"Great, compact unit. Perfect for small to mid-size vehicles. Plenty of power for the recreational CBer."
5,Who am I?,"This is the fundamental question address by Ken Wilber in the book, who goes on explaining how we answer this question throughout life: setting boundaries. Around this idea -the setting of boundaries which inevitably narrow our sense of self - Wilber constructs an innovative and eye-oppening approach to this philosophical question, thus presenting the path in reverse: how to dissolve boundaries, expanding our sense of self until we reach the ultimate level of consciousness: Unity Consciousness.I acquired this book for my studies in Transpersonal Therapy but I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys personal development. By the end of the book, Wilber gives us extensive knowledge of the processes involved in each consciousness level, the dis-eases that may appear and the recommended therapies and books. This is an amazing book, written in a very comprehensible manner, with lots of humor. I loved it and it made a huge impact on me."
4,"A User's Guide for ""Spectrum of Consciousness""","""No Boundary"" was written by Wilber to be a complement to his first book, ""The Spectrum of Consciousness"". Written with a less-academic style and more of an emphasis on practice than theory, No Boundary sketches a basic program of psychological and spiritual development. Although it has been superceded by ""Integral Psychology"", ""Boundary"" remains an indispensible part of Wilber's early canon."
1,Wilber's approach to buddhism,"My comments are based solely on an interview Mr. Wilber did with the New Dimensions radio show. During this interview he revealed a thorough lack of understanding of even the most basic teachings of buddhism. So, please, take anything Mr. Wilber says in this regard with a huge grain of salt."
2,Mind Games,This book is just filled with quotes from people that are smarter than the author. His attempt to tie all this together is filled with one-liners that are aimed to confuse and be-little the reader. He defends his writtings by saying that no language is capable of describing his conclusions. If this was so apparent to him why did he try. As one of the lucky few who frequently experience Outer Body Experiences I agree with his conclusions about unity consciousness but think he holds a high alter for which I believe to be easily obtainable by all. Other avenues will yeild greater results with the same effort.
3,Fur Mouse,"Ok, Cat toy. I problem should have checked the pet stores first. In my opinion, too expensive for what you get, but to was convenient to order from Amazon."
4,good overview,"When I picked this book up off the shelve at my college library, I was looking for garb idea for my local SCA chapter. What I found instead was a wonderful resource of information regarding 15th & 16th century everyday life. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants more info on the everyday objects (glassware, jewelery boxes, etc) people used."
3,Shorter than I thought,"The dimensions are 17""Lx10""Wx7""H. 17"" is just enough so your legs don't fall off if you are awake, but I wish it were longer. I wanted to use it for sleeping and if you lean or roll to one side your legs will definitely come off. The picture (which seems to change) is/may be deceiving. Tip: 17 inches might be the distance from fingertip to elbow; check it out. The foam is pretty firm but comfortable enough. The blue fabric cover comes off which I assume is washable."
3,Too short unless you are a child or an elf,I didn't realize how short this thing is. It should be advertized as child sized. It seems too short to work unless I tie my knees together maybe so one doesn't slip off.
2,Itty Bitty Knee Pillow,"They should say this is for children & Hobbits. This is only 17 inches long which is long enough to fit both knees on it only if you press your knees tightly together. If not, you can expect one leg to fall off.If you are a normal size adult, I would recommend the 8 inch knee wedgeDuro-Med Ortho Bed Wedge with Blue Polyester/Cotton Cover, 8 x 20 x 24or the 10 inch knee wedge10"" x 20"" x 30 1/2"" Ortho Bed Wedge. Or, tryMabis/DMI healthcare Elevating Leg Rests, Bluewhich is the longer version of this knee pillow. Check the dimensions prior to purchase whichever one you chose. It would also probably be helpful if you folded up some blankets to simulate the different heights to see which pillow works best for you."
3,Somewhat helpful,"While recovering from surgery, which necessitated sleeping on my back, I used two of these under my knees. I think that you'd have to be very small to be able to get by with one. They turned out to be a little too firm to be completely comfortable, but the optimum degree of firmness (and height) will likely vary considerably from individual to individual. Adding a thick towel helped some."
5,The product works for me!,"I was worried about ordering this after I read the negative reviews but the width works fine for me. I'm 5'5"" and this was exactly what I wanted. It is firm, but the last brand I had was so soft it didn't provide any support. I do see the point that larger people would probably want one wider than this one. I'm not sure what people meant about the picture not representing it, maybe the photo makes it look longer, but the size is listed in the description. The cover is what one would expect for this type of product. Don't be afraid of purchasing this unless you require a wider product."
4,"Pain relief found, but used only during the day.",It is exactly what is needed for my osteoarthritis. It arrived early and I am a satisfied customer. It helped ease my lower spine.
2,okay,"This pillow is too hard. I have another one I bought from Contour that is much more softer. The cover material feels like a 200 thread count, not soft at all. There are no pillow cases to put on this pillow so it makes a difference. The Countour pillow has a softer cover on it which I loved. Overall, it serves its purpose to raise your legs but is not comfortable like others I have had."
3,Works as intended,"This product is good for under the knees, I think I may get a different one however...I need my lower leg elevated also. I thought I ordered the one for both..."
4,Leg Rest,"When the ad indicated that this product comes with a cotton cover, I assumed originally that's how it should come and by your stating ""cotton cover"" included that meant is an extra cover. so, I felt that was missleading."
2,Too Small. I was disappointed.,"Too Small. Its actually 16""x 10""X 6.5"". Its even smaller than advertised. I was disappointed but cant blame the seller since i did not check the dimension. I was happy to see the picture on the screen..."
2,too small,"The photo is misleading. This pillow is too short along the ""long"" edge. People have to keep their knees together for their legs to stay on the pillow. If they relax, the legs fall off the side."
3,A little too firm,"I ordered this for my wife to place under her knees to assist her in sleeping due to a medical issue. She found the foam was a little too firm for her liking, the point at the top cut into the back of her legs. I tried to round off the top but it was still not comfortable enough, so we bought a different product."
3,Don't go by the picture....,"I can still use this product but I wish they use the correct picture online. This product is not as long as it shows on the picture. It's only 17inches long. I guess it was my fault not reading all the product dimension thinking that I was looking at the picture of the same item being sold. Live and learn, I guess."
1,too small to really use,"Item is far narrower than it appears in picture on web site and packaging; too narrow to use under knees without your legs falling off either side. Should have listened to user comments! If you order something like this, make sure the width is at least 20+"" or you'll just fall off the sides. This says 17"" but the pictures on this web site and on the item packaging are clearly of a different (wider) product."
5,Perfect for massage,"This is perfect for use with a massage table. Fits just right under the knees and was just what I was looking for! I do think if I was using it for sleep purposes, in bed, it might be a little too short in width. However, when someone is laying on a 30 inch table, it's a perfect fit. And I've heard nothing but compliments on the difference it makes in comfort."
1,Warning! Wrong Picture!,"Great idea, Great picture!Unfortunately the product doesn't match the picture. In fact, the product doesn't even match the picture on the product when shipped!This leg rest is only 17 inches long. Just not wide enough for an adult, it would be probably too big for a child."
1,Leg Rest,"Took forever to receive this leg rest and once it arrived it was not what I thought I was getting. The size was smaller than expected, therefore I am returning."
2,Photo is deceiving,"I was disappointed by the size, it is much smaller than it appears in the photo. It appears as if it is wider than it really is. The photo displays it extending past both knees width wise.This deception makes me leery of purchasing additional products."
4,it works,"Good Product, i bought it for my sister who suffer from back pain, my sister tried it and said that after a few days of using the leg rest, her back pain is much less,we have to wait and see how long will it last. will it keep its shap and firmness or will it loose it's shap?"
5,Mom gives thumbs up!,I got this for my mother who is almost confined to her bed. She loves it. It keeps her from sliding down in bed and elevates her legs and makes her back so much more comfortable.
5,Elevating knee and leg rest,"This product allows me to sleep, pain free! The pillows usually last a few yrs and they are excellent!"
4,nice after back surgery,This item is great for resting while awake or for short naps. However it is a bit short and I might rather have gotten a longer version for a little bit more money had I known. Good deal though.
5,Sounds of the Season review,Sounds of the Season and Sounds of the Season II are my absolute favorite Christmas CD's; I never get tired of hearing them and they always brighten the season for me. I highly recommend both CD's.
2,Terrible,This item will not print pictures and is useless.Then cost of returning it is hardley worth the expense.we are still trying to get it to operate.
5,Seeing Is Believing,"After phone calls,questions,and tons of reviews I have ended my search for the perfect printer to match with my HP 318. My wife and kid must have thought that I was crazy,after taking back camera after camera only to find out I only needed a better printer. This little HP more than backs up the near perfect 5 Star rating. It was a snap to setup and the quality had me comparing the pictures I printed( the first few) to some taken with my more expensive 35mm. I must admit the reviews on this site is what really steered me this way,and I just had to write to says thanks and give my two thumbs way up for this fine little machine."
2,initially look awesome. but it fades over time.,love the compactness and stylish look of this printer.initial quality of the print out is comparable to regular photo prints or perhaps even better. compact flash drive built in is absolutely convinient.However... after putting print picture on my friz door for 2 month. skin tone color has changed to completely green and other colors faded to dark purple. it wasn't exposed to direct sunlight neither. other pictures all suffered discoloration after 2 month. even the ones that were kept well in a frame. it was all printed on premiere papers that came with the printer.is this the limitation of inkjet technology everyone already aknowledged prior to purchasing? or am I the only one suffering from discolorization and fade?
5,Great Printer,"I've this printer for about 4 months now. I love it. I also have an HP880c for our regular everyday printing. We also use that printer for pictures, but the clarity and ease of use is nothing compared to the HP PhotoSmart 100. At my cousins baptism we printed pictures from 3 different digital camera's (Canon, Sony, and Fuji). Everyone was impressed with the ease of use, how quick it printed and how good the pictures look.It only prints wallet, 3x5 and 4x6 pictures, however, we really don't print many 5x7's or larger. If we do I just use our other printer.If you have a digital camera this is a great printer to go along with it. Shop around and you can find a great price too."
2,Forget printing envelopes,"I purchased this printer in Aug. 2001. From the start it would not print envelopes.Jammed every one or printed crooked. After numerous non toll free phone calls to HP, who put me thru the wringer on the phone,trying various things to get it to print an envelope, I got a replacement printer.Guess what? It won't print envelopes either ! Same issue ! I have spent over [price]in long distance trying to get HP to send me another printer.I have given up & am turning it all over to my state's consumer affairs office for action. Maybe they can get HP to stand by their product !Prints pictures great....just NOT envelopes !!"
5,good stuff,I really love this series for myself and my teenaged children. It is entertaining and well written. I will continue buying until I have the whole reader's series.
5,Traitor's Gate Rocks,"Traitor's Gate is just about my favorite game ever. It has awesome graphics, a fully admersive 3-D world, and is just challenging anough to make you think before you make a decision, but not so challenging that you will have to go back to a saved game a billion times before you figure out the puzzle you are working on.If you like 1st person games that look incredibly realistic, are challenging, and make you wish you WERE the person the game is about, then you will really love this game!"
2,"nice to look at, awkward to play","This game is full of great visuals - lots of rooms to explore and things to look at. The explanations and the email descriptions of items are rich and obviously the designers took a lot of time to get the details right.That being said, the game is pretty awkward to play - using the tools is very unintuitive. Very few of the visual items will actually let you get close to them or interact with them. It is visually awkward too - your vantage point seems to be from somewhere up on the ceiling, and the PDA (controls and tools) display takes up half the screen.All in all, it is interesting to explore but frustrating to play."
4,Great Product with some changes from 2001,"I have always loved money and this was the upgrade from the 2001 money. I like the new UI and some new enhancements in background banking, Advisor FYI and the best feature was money side."
3,"Everything You Need to Know About Lyme Disease and Other Tick-Borne Disorders, 2nd Edition","This intriguing book provides an in-depth look at Lyme disease; what it is, where it is found, how to diagnose and prevent it, and finally, how to treat it.The information on ticks, where they are found, and the suggestions on how to prevent Lyme and treat the illness through antibiotics is extensive, interesting and useful.However, the author describes pharmaceutical antibiotics as being the only viable option for treating Lyme Disease, when in fact there exist a multitude of other therapies for combatting the illness, some of which can be more effective than antibiotics. These include Rife machines, salt/C, herbal antibiotics, Immune Response Training, and homeopathy."
2,misleading sizing,I bought this as a support garment and was hoping for/expecting it to be kind of tight and 'squeezy' but this was ridiculous. I'm a large gal so I ordered multiple Xs (actually more than what I thought would really be necessary) but apparently not enough of them. This thing was less than half as wide as what I would need. I couldn't even begin to put it on. It went back immediately.
1,Weak version of good classic,Over all it is ok at best when I'm in a good mood.Was hoping for the classic dub of doom sound but not available out of 7 versions. No samples to compare so I had to buy and pray. Only have the dub of doom on record so looks like I'm going to have to transfer it on my own to cd.Just my opinion but try to find a sample before buying. Not what I was looking for.
2,Disappointed,Disappointed with this remixed version. I was looking for the radio version heard on NYC radios.
5,Excellent Drive Enclosure.,The Mediasonic drive enclosure is identical to the Adaptec version that is also on the market. They are just branded differently. Highly recommended product!
4,Trip Thru Time,"Must admit, I have no clue as to how the other reviewer could not enjoy this trip thru time. It reminded me so much of my childhood and the things my mom had in her kitchen. I could almost smell the cookies from the oven. The author really did a great job!! I have already purchased a few other copies as it is going to make a great Christmas gift for my sisters Doris and Shirley."
5,CoverBlend Concealing Treatment Makeup,"This is a wonderful product that I have used for years. A small amount gives great coverage, and I like the addition of SPF 20."
4,Better than anything I've tried...,"After losing half my nose (on one side) due to basal/squamous cell carcinoma (wear your sunscreen!), I had facial reconstruction. Although a miracle restoration, I had a major skin coloration difference that was quite visible. The Cover Blend really made this unnoticeable. My only wish is that there was a 'color palette' available to purchase (with a small quantity of perhaps 3-4 shades) so that the proper match could be determined before ordering the full amount. There's a 'lifetime supply' of the one you order, so be prepared to accept the shade you've selected. This product is easy to apply and offers full coverage of surgical scarring and discoloration. I'd recommend it unreservedly. BTW, I don't know why my reviews appear under my husband's name, but I am female and very conscious of how I look."
3,Good book for beginners,"I hope I can come back and edit my review. I have not finished this book yet, but I am very interested in programming and this book has been a gem thus far. I have a college education but it is in psychology. I am currently pursuing a Masters in Information Systems and Technology and trying to teach myself programming as I am interested in usability, gaming, mobile apps etc. I have a bit of ADD (attention deficit disorder) so sometimes the author(s) seem to go on and on when I'm just ready to move on, but that is probably good. Sometimes the question the author's wife comes up with are just the questions I have in my head then sometimes I don't even know what she is asking. I love computers and technology but have no prior deep technological knowledge or experience. If I see that the book has truly helped me, I will come back and give a higher rating. Either way, the book should not get any lower rating than three stars!"
3,"movie's bad in a good way, quality is bad in a bad way","so, if you're looking at this since it's a godfrey ho/joseph lai flick then you already know what you're getting into.the video quality is terrible, it's a transfer from an abused VHS tape that had sporadic tracking issues during the transfer... including scenes that went b&w; for a moment before reverting to color. at seven bucks the movie's definitely worth it... don't let people gouge you on the price.i'm almost convinced that this is just a hack-job someone put together after picking up an ebay copy of the VHS."
5,Love this story,I really loved this story. I had read it to my son and daughter and they both liked the characters and the princess. Its a great message for kids and for my daughter; a really cute twist. I would recommend this story to anyone with young kids!
2,Not for little kids,"I bought this book for my 3 year old for Christmas, but I'm not going to give it to her. It's definitely for an older audience. While it does send the message that girls don't have to be fairy princesses, it doesn't do it in a positive way."
2,Bad ending,"We loved the idea of a princess who would save the prince, but when he didn't respect her...she left him high and dry. The story is great right up until the very end. A blunt and badly written ending. We had to re-write it ourselves in order to get satisfaction from the story line! Find another book to empower your princess!"
1,read it before you buy it,All the hype made it sound like a book filled the sort of things you would want your girls to take to heart- except that the story line is weak and the writing lacking...not worthy of our time....
5,A MUST TO READ ALOUD,"The first time I read this book to my children, Robert Munsch became my all time favorite author!The story itself is so endearing...the ending so unexpected! As a child of Disney Fairy Tales.... all so predictable... Robert Munsch is so refreshing!!!I love the spunk of all Munsch's characters and their unique probleming solving techniques!This story is a must for childhood, as well as for parents who love to read to their children!!"
2,matchbox copy,The Paper Bag Princess was a cute story but I wasn't expecting it to be matchbox size. I was very disappointed in the product for the price.
4,Modern classic!,"I read the Paper bag princess (by Robert Munsch and illustrated by Michael Martchenko) when I was DD's age and loved it. I instantly recalled the pictures of the sleepy looking dragon when I heard the title again. Princess Elizabeth is to be married to a pompous Prince when he is kidnapped by a dragon. With a twist on the usual Fairy tale, it is the Princess who sets off to rescue the Prince. Elizabeth is one smart spunky girl who isn't going to let anyone else determine her happily ever after. This is definitely a modern classic and I was thrilled when my own girls liked it as much as I did `back in the day'.The messages the book sends:Girls aren't any less powerful or resourceful than boys.Happily ever after isn't like the movies!If someone treats you badly you don't have to stick around and put up with it.Netgalley sent me a digital copy of this book of the in return for an honest reviewI will not receive any monetary compensation from Netgalley or the book's publisher"
5,Wonderful story!,"I love the message in this book! Elizabeth fights back and, at the end, stands up for herself. I think every girl should have this book.This book was a gift to my daughter, and we ADORE it! I've been reading it to her since she was a year old. At first she likes the pace of the story and the pictures, but I'm hoping the message will stick as she gets older! :-) My eight year old niece also has this book and thinks it's great."
5,A Princess Reviewed,"Fantastic! The adventures of the feisty Princess Elizabeth will surely bring smiles and chuckles to girls and boys of all ages. I'm giving this to my princess (my niece) for her upcoming 12th birthday. I hope this will enlighten and give her insight to potential roles, choices, and self-perception as she walks into the the teen years that loom ahead!"
5,This Book Is Great,"This book is great I read it for an english project on censorship and found myself buying a copy, because I enjoyed it so much"
3,BUYER BEWARE!,"This is a great story! As a third grade teacher, my class and I both enjoy this book. As someone earlier mentioned, it's great for people 3 to 103! BUT, I took off 2 stars for the SIZE of the book. I suppose it's my fault for not looking at the dimensions, but seriously, who makes a book this small?? I definitely won't be able to use this version for read alouds, but I guess my kids will get a kick out of it. I, however, doubt I will personally read it myself."
1,Donot buy this book for your kids unless you want them calling kids Bums!,"Really a terrible book. The authors are trying to teach a good principal but go about it in the wrong way. A princess goes to rescue a prince (shouldn't it be other way around) and after all her heroics she ends up calling him a bum and the book ends, This is by far the lamest children's book I have ever seen, not suitable for any age."
1,The Paper Bag Princess,"This book was an all around disappointment. What a surprise I got when I received a small little book of 3 1/2"" X 3 1/2"". I know the cost was low, but come on, it was more than $3 plus shipping! I went back and checked the product page to see if it mentioned the size. It did in the notes which were very small and down below under the product information. I just never look at product information for a book. I feel it should have been by the title. The story was also not well done. It had a very weak ending. The illustrations were okay, not great."
1,Teeny tiny book!,I didn't realize prior to purchasing this book that it's a tiny version (2 inches by 2 inches) of the paperback copy. I was very upset that I didn't pay more attention to the dimensions as I was wanting a normal paperback size.
1,Not worth the money,The story is not bad but certainly not the best. However what gets me is paying almost $3.50 for a book that's smaller than a 3 x 5 index card. So be warned.
2,Watch out!,Don't get fooled by the price... you will be getting a VERY small book for the small price.
3,"love the book, was very dissappointed that the was tiny","I ordered the 3 copies of the book to be part of a book giveaway to young children in a reading program. I was extremely disappointed that the books were so tiny. When my daughter was young, she had a paperback copy that was regular size and that's what I thought I was ordering. It's kind of a rip off being that tiny. It's not a good idea as a novelty and is very small for a young child."
5,Great alternative to Princess overload,"I love this story. I think it's great that there's a children's book that shows a girl solving a problem using her brains, not her brawn and reversing the gender roles. Our daughter sees the reversed gender roles everyday when mommy goes to work and daddy stays home. :)"
2,Love story Missing Text,I love the Paper Bag Princess I got the board book because my daughter is hard on books. I was disappointed that the board book was missing parts of the story. I never thought they would edit and abridge the story if I had known that I would never got this version of the book I am so sad.:(
4,"Cute story, though quite short","An up-to-date twist of princes stories, with a positive, likable, strong girl character. The only complaint I'd have is that the story is quite short."
5,My kind of princess!,"I was invited to be the ""secret reader"" for my grandson's first grade class and chose this book.I was a bit worried that he would be disappointed that his Mimi brought a ""girly"" book, but he and his classmates loved it.This is not your stereotypical princess---she is courageous, determined, and clever. She learns a valuable lesson about people not always being what they appear to be. I highly reccommend this book."
5,I loved this book!!,"Princess Elizabeth's world gets destroyed by a dragon - her castle is smashed, her clothes are burned, and her Prince is carried off by a dragon.Does Elizabeth sit back and let the dragon win? Nope.She puts on a paperbag and heads out to rescue her man. She puts her smarts to good use and defeats the dragon. No violence.And for her troubles? Ronald yells at her!! What's a Princess to do? She tells him off an skips off into the sunset.I loved Elizabeth's resoursefulness. I loved how the test of her character showed her that Ronald wasn't the Prince for her. I loved how, instead of weeping over the loss of such an unprincely Prince, she dances off into the sunset.This book is one of my all-time favorite stories."
3,Disappointed by this version,"I love the original version of this book, but found that the ""revised text"" edition used in the board book took most of the character out of the story. Examples: ""burned all her clothes with his fiery breath"" becomes ""burnt up her clothes"", and a whole page of fun, imagination-inspiring narrative ending with ""he was easy to follow because he left a trail of burnt forests and horses' teeth"" is revised to end with simply ""followed the dragon to his cave.""It seems that there is a fear of using too many big words with young children. Or maybe there is a feeling that parents don't want to be bothered to explain the big words while reading to their kids. Whatever the reason, it's a shame.The illustrations remain the same as in the original, however. I let my children look at the board book while reading to them from my tiny, dilapidated original version so they can hear a good story.I highly recommend purchasing the original version of this book, not the board book."
4,Changed the ending.,"I do like how the female protagonist outwits the dragon without the use of violence. However, I felt that the ending, ""You're a bum!"" lowered her to the shallow Prince's level. For my granddaughter, I changed the ending to read:""You are not worthy of me, and I prefer not to marry you. I am strong. I am smart, and I am quite capable of taking care of myself!"""
5,A story to pass down!,"My mother bought this story for me in 1995. I used it originally for a story telling speech tournament which I won first place for. She then kept the book until I had my own daughter 2 years ago. My daughter LOVES this book, I'm thinking if I should have it laminated. It is her ""princess book"". She loves this book so much she is going to be a dragon for halloween! (interesting that she chose to be a dragon and not a princess) We rotate this book with about 5 other Robert Munsch books she adores!"
5,Great read!!!,Read it to my girls and they loved it!!! they are 4 & 10 years old. Love how the princess is very confidant!!_
4,Cute story,This is a cute story of female empowerment. I read this to my first daughter who is now 21 years old and she loved it. I had forgotten about the book but was happy to rediscover it with my 5 year recently.
5,Great For All Girls,"Get this book for all little girls (and not so little girls). Our little princesses should not dream about marrying princes. This book is about a princess who saves the prince, only to realize that he's not good enough for her."
5,good story,"me, my wife, and the kids (3 and 5) love this story. My wife even got dressed up as the princess for Halloween. Go buy it!"
3,My mistake,"I couldn't help but laugh when I received the package. Next time I will read the description better. I thought it was going to be a regular size book, but it was a little book. No problem though, it still worked for what I wanted. I received product when promised too."
2,Disappointed read!,"I thought this would be a fun book to read to my6-year old grandaughter. Very disappointed in thebook; it seemed like the author cut it way too shortto be interesting or fun. The ending was really a drag .... my 6 year old said, ""what the heck"". Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Paper Bag Princess,"This book was a soft cover and was rather small. Unfortunately it was a bit of a disappointment, but that was my fault not the sellers fault. I am sure that it was stated how many pages and the size of the book, I was just in a rush."
1,Yikes!,"CAUTION....this book is way too tiny for the price. I assumed this was a ""standard sized"" book, and I didn't look at the measurements. It is tiny tiny tiny! Very disappointed. Shame on you, Amazon."
5,work saver,The Wesco Maxi Mover saved me a lot of leg work and my back by useing the Maxi to carry parts and tools to work site. It's the best product for the money I ever bought..
5,Funny and worth the money!,Great continuation of the previous seasons. Fun to have on hand to watch during dull tv times!
1,Show's Good - Link's Bad,As always That 70's Show is great. The episodes are very good however the links on the scene selection screen do not work. The only way to watch the dvd's is to select play all. I'm seriously considering returning the product.
5,a third visit to point place,"that 70s show has been one of foxs most populer shows and it is very clear why. with great comedy tettering on the edge of slapstick, it was this formula that made it run for an impressive eight seasons. in the third season of the show, we are given sort of mellow season in which jackie and kelso get back together, the gang head for an ice shack, the conclusion of last seasons cliffhanger in reefer madness, a hitchcockian halloween theme, fez and his psycho girlfriend, the famous dine and dash, the day donna becomes 'hot donna', kittys birthday, and the cursed promis ring. that 70s show still hasent lost it charm cause it main formula is not the comedy but heart which is why it delivers good episodes. enjoy this season and wait until season four when the fur flies."
5,Imaginative...Beautiful...Grossly Hilarious!,It's been the only thing in my dvd player since the first two seasons...I can't get enough!
5,That Seventy's Show-season three,"Outstanding! I became a huge fan of this series only at the end of 2005. I now own the first three season's and can't wait for season four to become available for purchase. Having grown up in the 70's, it brings back good memories."
5,amazing series!,Season 3 is a great addition to your That 70s Show collection! This was the most hysterical show ever and will be missed! Its awesome how amazon is keepin them alive <3
1,Had to return,Had to return to shipper for credit. It did not playon my dvd player.I was very disappointed to say the least.
5,Love That '70's show,How did I miss this show when it was on. Thankful for good old TV Land. This is the funniest show!!
5,That's (another great) 70's Show,"A must have for the die-hard fan of ""That'70's Show"". Season 3 is just another great box set to have in your collection."
3,A book from the heart,"This book is very well written, but the emphasis is not on Anne's alcoholism as you might think - more is writen about her career and how many jobs she's had, I lost track a number of times for the first quarter of the book, however, it is written from her heart and I think she's a very brave lady to let the world read this book given how famous she is. It takes you from the depths of her life right through to what she has achieved today. She has certainly earned what she's got now!"
1,Bait and Switch,"Seems like the authors wanted to cash in on the brand name of TM and so they put it in their title. But the book is not about TM, its about other meditations."
5,our two year-old daughter loves this book,"a. is a book-loving toddler who is also a huge fan of art and breasts, so when i saw a book on breasts in art, well ... i bought it at our local bookstore without opening it. and i was not disappointed ... her favorite, gaugin, is represented nicely, as is picasso and gustav klimt.we also bought ""feet in art,"" and it's just as well-done by the bridgeman art library.i'm looking for more ... maybe, elbows .. or noses would be awesome!"
1,Not worth it,"When I bought this book, there wasn't any review or article I could read from to get an Idea on what could it realle be about. I was expexting some reading and some pictures as well, but it turned out to be a thick book with about 15 pages(like those kiddies books for 3 year olds) and only fotographs of paintings, and NOTHING else, not even one line of reading per page exept the autor of the painting, and that is it. It may be a nice recopilation of art, for sure.. but I would really like to know a bit more about how breasts afeected art and evolved throughout history, this book doesn't cover anything on that... just plain old paintings and one has to wonder where did they come from."
2,Does Not Cling,"I applied this to my window, but it fell down. But I find that if you just apply some glue, it clings okay!"
3,this thing clinged to everthing,"As soon as I peeled the backing off, this thing clinged to my hand. Aware of it's clingy nature... I tried to just shake it off... I was running around just shakin' it around like crazy... and in the process I ended up getting it to cling to my cat. OMG... what a disaster that was. I clinged to my cat and she freaked out and thought it was some kinda trap or something, and starting clawing and scratching just making it worse and worse. Finally after about ten minutes, we were all worn out and the thing clinged all over the place. We ended up using some Oops adhesive remover to finally break the cling. I returned the product the next day. Three stars for being ""as advertised"" but not worth the hassle. maybe a great gag gift though."
1,Disappointing,"Not only is this not near clingy enough, it only comes in a Window version. There needs to be a Mac version as well."
2,Not Your Father's Clingy,"This is not up to the old window clingy standards, and certainly it's not even a Jamie Farr-ish level clinger. I'd suggest you keep looking for old used ones on Craigslist or at the usual clingy swap meets. You'll get more clingyness and even more holes from a used one. I'd almost rather go clingy free than use such a sub-par product. Very disappointing."
3,Clean Cling,"Tight cling, no glue needed, simple clingy action. Removal of clingy is simple just add soap and water rub gently, comes right off. Make sure your cling is clean before application."
4,My Opinion,"Beethoven in Paradise is not what I expected. I originally bought this book because my son plays the violin and I thought he might like it. I'm glad I read it first because I'm not sure I'll let him read it just yet since he's nine years old and I have a pretty strict policy about the use of profanity, which this book has in ample supply. (I'd give it a PG 13.) The use of profanity is justified, though, and adds greatly to the authenticity of the setting and characters. I would highly recommend it to students of middle school age and would consider reading it aloud to my fourth graders, although I would have to use quite a few euphemisms. The messages in this book are so powerful: Be true to yourself, stand up for what you believe in, and follow your dreams. Even though I sort of wanted a sappy ""everything's going to turn out alright"" ending, the actual ending was very realistic and genuine."
5,5 Stars are not enough for Rating this Series...,"...to quote Carl ""Billions and Billions of Stars"" would be the rating this series should receive. I first saw the episodes when I was 9 yrs old and it has forever sparked my interest in science. I can look back on the events of my life and mark those days as the beginning of my quest for knowledge and truth. If ever a series should be re-released, this would be my first choice. Hands Down!"
5,makes the esoteric understandable and enjoyable.,"everything, the music, the content and scope are without peer. The greatest value for me was as a teaching tool for my children. Mr. Sagan was able to say the words with the clarity and enthusiasm I was seeking. Bring it back! Is anybody out there listening?"
5,This momentous work compellingly tells an important message,"This momentous work compelling tells an important message about far more than astronomy and science. Serious students of philosophy, the arts and humanities will find much to warrant the purchase of this important series. Please add your voice to those urging the re-release of this important video series. BRING BACK ""COSMOS"" !!"
5,"The best, period. Now it's time to bring it back.","Like many of the other reviewers, my life was changed by COSMOS. Add my vote to get it available again on video. (I believe Turner Home Video owns the rights.) Whatever problems are holding up its re-release should be promptly resolved so that this major cultural achievement can be enjoyed by humanity again."
5,Cosmos on VHS please!,"Currently reading ""Bilions and Billions"" and remembered watching the Cosmos series when it was aired in India. I had it taped then-need it on VHS/NTSC."
5,THE BEST PROGRAM IN ALL TV HISTORY,"I'M 27 YEARS OLD NOW, AND I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW OLD I WAS WHEN I SAW THE COSMOS SERIES IN TELEVISION, BUT I DO REMEMBER ONE THING... IT CHANGES MY LIFE, AND MY WAY TO SEE THE WORLD, I HOPE I CAN GET IT BY THIS WAY, IN SPANISH VERSION IF IT'S POSSIBLE"
5,I miss Carl Sagan... I hope to see COSMOS on DVD soon!,"I recently borrowed the entire series from the library and painstakingly dubbed it into my computer so I could pull up the videos anytime I wish. The quality is poor, but the fabulous content and unique narrative style of Dr. Carl Sagan still come through. How I wish the whole thing was on a couple glorious DVD discs instead of this lousy copy! Please, please release this series again (in any form, but preferably DVD). To me, it would be a great way to immortalize the memory of Carl Sagan."
5,"Awesome, one of the greatest TV programs ever",Our whole family has enjoyed this series and the tapes are worn out. Please re-release Carl Sagan's greatest work. Thank you.
5,Cosmos should be required viewing in all schools,I have the cosmos set and I am 18 years old and it helped me find apart of myself that I never would have found otherwise.Cosmos should be rereleased for all generations to share in.
5,Please Bring Cosmos Back,"There has been no video that has ever impacted me on the level that Cosmos has. It is the best science video ever made. Maybe most impressive is its coverage of the history of science, a topic not often found addressed well, and Carl Sagan's accessible explanation of relativity and the speed of light. Please re-release this video"
5,Best Science Series,This is the best science series ever made. A word to the publisher: Please rerelease it.
1,Poor fitment,"The liners look great but fitment is another story. My truck has a manual transmission and everytime I engage the clutch it goes behind the liner, needless to say when I release the clutch the liner is pulled up out of place, I fixed that by adding one of the clips from the passenger side mat to the troubled spot on the driver side. The caps on the driver side mat also do not fit over the factory mat holders as stated in the instructions, allowing mud/water/snow down to the factory carpet. Not to mention that I only have one clip securing the passenger side mat. I would not recommend these liners to anyone with a 2005+ Toyota Tacoma."
3,good but not great,"I was somewhat disappointed in this video insofar as the lack of behind-the-scenes stuff on it. There were no decent interviews of band members; only sound-bites. I was hoping they would have some rarely seen documentary-type video of the group talking and doing their thing before and after the shows. Unfourtunately, there was precious little of that. They did have a good segment of Michael Hutchence playing ""Mystify"" on the piano in the studio which was really cool! Also the music of course was great and a good deal of my favorite songs were included. The narration, however, left much to be desired; the guy sounded like he was trying to hurry up and get it over with as fast as possible. I'm sure the script was written with an appeal to a general audience; kinda like Joe Friday, ""just the facts"" so for anyone who's followed the band at all there's no really interesting commentary.To sum up: Pretty decent collection of music videos but fairly shallow."
4,Great Video Clips,"The documentary part of this video is only so-so, and uses a split screen format that can get annoying, but does include some remixes (from ""X"") cut with live footage. The real reason this collection is a must-have is that the last forty minutes or so of the tape include the FULL videos for the singles from ""Welcome To Wherever You Are"" and three songs from ""Full Moon, Dirty Hearts"", plus ""The Strangest Party"". Fantastic! The clip for ""Taste It"" alone makes this tape well worth the ten bucks!"
5,"I saw the Doggie Driver on the ""Today Show""","I saw the Doggie Driver on the ""Today Show"" last week with Katie Couric. It was everything they said and much more. It's a great way to practice your swing and have fun with your best friend. I highly recommend the Doggie Driver if you love golf!The Doggie Driver is a BAll!"
1,what an utter disappointment,"We have tried to use this multiple times and it never works. My husband is a golfer, he knows how to swing a club. The ball either wont fly out of the holder, or you have to barely place it in the holder so it can fly out and then it just flies a few feet with no control. We have used the ball included, old balls, tennis balls, smooth balls, makes no difference what the ball texture is, it either is too loose or too tight. I wish I kept the receipt, I would return it if I had."
1,Not really safe,"Generally I love devices that help launch a ball so a dog can get a bit more exercise. However, I dislike this one because the ball leaves the ground and goes up. If your dog is eager to grab the ball, they can easily get in the way and be struck by the club or by the ball leaving at a high speed. I've seen a few dogs at the park injured with this product and similar ones. It's much safer to use aChuckit! Pocket Ball Launcher (Colors Vary). Not only will you not injure your dog, but it's easier to launch. I've seen one dog try to get the ball before the person has time to ""swing"" the club. All in all, there are much better options than this considering the Chuckit is also cheaper."
5,Most Fun Dog Toy Ever Invented - The Doggie Driver,"If you love Golf and you have a dog, this is the absoultely best Dog Toy ever invented. It's great to hit the park and practice your swing while exercising your best friend. I would highly recommend this product! It's great for the golf lover or a super gift for those who you know have a dog. I can't say enough about it!The Doggie Driver has got to be the toy of the year, hands down!"
1,am I just not using it right?,"We have tried to use this multiple times and it never works. My husband is a golfer, he knows how to swing a club. The ball either wont fly out of the holder, or you have to barely place it in the holder so it can fly out and then it just flies a few feet with no control. We have used the ball included, old balls, tennis balls, smooth balls, makes no difference what the ball texture is, it either is too loose or too tight. I wish I kept the receipt, I would return it if I had."
1,Don't waste your time,"I'm running a Windows machine 500mghz Pentium III 512 Ram and many extras..Disk Image wouldn't write to the second CD-R (no spanning) so if your image file is over 650 megs and you're using a CD writer, don't bother..Also, the last try I gave the progam, it booted to DOS and then froze. Every time I re-booted the computer it started in DOS and then ran the Disk Image program, which promptly froze. I had to use the Windows 98 rescue disk to recover from the backup program!! Oh, the irony! Well, it took 6 hours to recover from the recovery program!"
1,"You'll be sorry, this is terrible software!","Power Quest's Partition Magic is wonderful, but you would think Drive Image would follow in Partition Magic's footsteps...WRONG!This is probably the worst software that I EVER bought. There are only some burners that are compatible with the software, so they say. I even bought one of the burners on their compatibility list. Their support staff wanted to blame it on the burner. Their support page is full of error messages and fixes, if that's not a good clue I don't know what is. I wanted it because Partition Magic is such a great utility, I was sure that Drive Image was great also. Man was I fooled. I had to make them give me my money back. I hope you take my word for it because I hate to see people go through what I went through. This doesn't even rate one star, but [...] scale starts at one. I would probably give it a negative 5 stars to tell you the truth."
2,Watch out for Windows XP,"When it works, it works great ... however, even though this program is touted as compatible with Windows XP, there is a known problem with backing up to NTFS disks. Buyer beware."
2,NOT compatible with XP,"Look, I've used Drive Image and Partition Magic for many years now and they have saved my data and posterior on many occasions. I had to upgrade to these newer versions because I now use Windows XP, what a pain! Neither one will boot to DOS so I am forced to use the emergency disks. The solution involves my having to send a copy of the 0 head of my drive to tech support so they can change it (WTFO). AND, Drive image doesn't like NTFS partitions created by XP. Any image files created on such a partition will not be accessible to use, rename, move, or delete (again, WTFO). I don't know what else to say, but after spending this much $$$ these dudes had better be putting out some major patches ASAP (no, the ones they have out do not fix these problems)I'd consider Norton Ghost, they seem to the compatibility thing down...."
4,"Informative, very good Read.",Good Book if you are looking for information on how Security affects the way COM Components work etc. Informative Book.Must read for all COM programmers.
3,"Some good spots, but generally thin","While there are some very informative sections of this book, I found it disappointing overall. I was very surprised at the author's reluctance to CLEARLY define basic terminology. The glossary is tempting, but of little real use. Like previous reviewers, I found both the verbosity and the large font distracting. To those interested in Windows security I would strongly recommend the relevant chapters in Jeffrey Richter's and Jason Clark's ""Programming Server-Side Applications"". They offer a much clearer and more thorough presentation of the topic."
1,Software Consultant,"I purchased this book based on all the good reviews out there. It was difficult to read and didn't explain much. I was really disappointed and would not recommend to this book for anyone getting into Windows security. I was looking for a book that would allow me to just right into examples and then come back for a better understanding on the details. I thank the person that recommended the ""Programming Server-Side Applications"" book. That books explains the security topic very well with good presentation. I've been doing C/C++ development for about 7 years in Windows now and this is the first book that I felt was so bad that I had to warn others about. I really like the other books by DevelopMentor (Essential COM, Effective COM, ATL Internals, etc.)"
4,It is hard to judge a classic out of context,"I am reading Programming Windows Security toward solving problems I run into with Windows 7. This classic was published in 2000, when Windows NT was state of the art. What I understand from those more knowledgable about security than I am, is that the foundation of Windows security has not changed much since 2000. Much of what we see in the latest Windows operating systems is more nuanced control of and perhaps more aggresive application of mechanisms that have been there all along.I have not seen or read anything that contradicts that, and so I am looking forward a more fundamental and even gentle introduction to security reading this book. Frankly, I did not get more than a couple chapters into it before I decided I needed to read more about advanced Windows. Consequently, I have about three books open now that I am moving through rather slowly. But what do you expect? This is not one of those bodice-rippers, so it will take some time and care to read."
5,At last a serious look at Windows security,Keith Brown's book is a refreshing change from the 'stick in something about security in a side-bar' approach taken by so many authors. Finally a book which explains lucidly what amounts to a very complex topic; and does so in an understandable and enjoyable fashion. If there were 6 stars on the rating scale then it would get a 6...
3,The title is Figurative but matches the tale.,"I was looking at this for awhile. It doesn't exactly stand out. Once you watch it(despite a major goof with Kono) Lopus=Garous is just as long a tale as it needs to be. Since we're following the four characters each meeting a Character arc-type it doesn't flood you with information and tells just enough to move the story along. The resolution to the mystery is the weakest part as the reasoning behind everything is tangentially connected to title. The viewpoint character is so subdued and usually only in a scene so we can see her reaction. The ""real"" Protagonist is on the cover, but you don't realize that until the movie is about half over. worth a look if you can see definitely worth at least a rental."
2,MY GRADE: C.,Imagine a world in which a virus did so much damage to society that the new world has decided it's best to keep people isolated in cities. As a result people rarely go out and communicate through virtual realities and the like. An intriguing idea but the info dumps early on were horribly executed and some of the characters were peculiar and just boring. After twenty minutes it was time to turn it off and no I'm not one of those people who believes you need to watch the whole thing before calling it a dud.OVERALL GRADE: C.
3,Meh,"The movie is just okay. This was a blind buy for me and I kinda regret it. The animation is kinda weird, not in a good way, and the plot is really slow and just not interesting. Not really worthy of my being in my collection."
2,Better for speaker switching than source switching,"Like another reviewer indicated, this is not a true source isolating switch - it is designed more for swapping sets of speakers than it is for sources. The ground is shared. Instructions are pretty weak - you can go to Dayton's website and see the one-page instruction sheet that comes with the unit - be very careful to make sure you have all your inputs & outputs correct before turning everything on. The mechanics of this switch (i.e.- shared ground) makes me very nervous."
1,Has anyone had luck source switching with this?,"I'd be interested if anyone who has used this switch for source switching has had good luck with it. Could be that all positive feedback is from those using it to select one of two sets of speakers. We are getting a ground hum as well in our source switching setup. By source switching, I mean we have one source coming from the TV audio output, and another source from a stereo system. We are selecting one of those two sources to play on the speakers with this switch. I give this one star since it is advertised as working for source switching, however the hum is so bad that I can't use it for that purpose."
4,Excellent interpretation of Mexico's history,"Frazer takes a new look at the hero-bandit and related characters of myth and reality, especially around the turn of the 20th century. He uses a suitable range of sources and shows how these fascinating characters played their part in pre-revolutionary Mexico,and just touches on their lingering legacy today. Essentially this is a good read recommended for general as well as academic audiences, although some general knowledge of Mexican history helps. I would have given it five stars instead of four if the author had not burdened his prose with academic buzzwords and repeated references to various social-science theories, especially in the Marxist camp. Still, no one will be bored. I look forward to Mr. Frazer's next contribution."
2,Not a good read,This book will leave you confused about RF design if you are new to it. However if you are quite familiar with the RF design you probably don't need this book. Then who is this book for I wonder? There are no mathematical details not are their enough intuitive details.
3,Pretty pictures- after a while,"Just purchased this printer along with a digital camera. Easy to install, I was able to print within minutes. However, it can take 5-10 MINUTES to print a full page photo. When using software to create multiple photos on a single page the printers memory becomes overloaded and it refuses to print. One reason I chose this printer was because it had a flash card reader built in (as well as a smartmedia card reader), supposedly to make it easier to download and print pictures.Unfortunately the flash card reader stopped working after the second time I used it."
3,"Great quality of output, annoying quirks","I've owned this printer for a few weeks now and have used it almost exclusively to print pictures. The quality of the output is outstanding, and the software that comes with the printer is easy to use, if basic.The first quirk I encountered is loading the paper. The 8.5x11 try has guides to help make sure the paper loads correctly during the printing. The 4x6 try has no guides, and it is kind of tricky to make sure your prints don't come out crooked.The next quirk is the fact that the output try is too short to reliably support an 8.5x11 piece of paper. I find that my prints were often kicked onto the floor, until I added a piece of cardboard to the output try.Neither of these quirks are show-stoppers and the output is nice, but they're very annoying."
1,beware of printer,"I bought this printer, correctly installed it, and everything was fine until I tried to play a cd and mp3's. They skipped and refused to play. Then I noticed everything on my brand new computer was running slow. I tried contacting HP a total of four times but nothing they told me to do helped my computer run normally with the printer still installed. I uninstalled the printer, and my computer returned to normal. My advice: don't buy this printer! (especially if you have a dell computer) Also, when I actually did print out a test photo, it really didn't look all that sharp (I even printed it out on HP premium photo paper). Back to the store it goes!"
2,Good Pictures - LOUSY PAPER FEEDER,Bought this printer - just recently - good quality prints but a disaster in printing multiple standard black and white material. I worked with HP support for a week and they recommended that I return it. I did and got a canon printer - cheaper better faster. Do not buy this printer.
1,Paper Jammer,"I have owned several HP printers and they are always perfect, so when I went to buy a new one, it was a no brainer - HP. However, I printed one page on this printer and never had another succesful print. It jams the paper, misfeeds the paper, scews the paper while printing. It was VERY frustrating. I would NOT recommend this printer. I returned it two days later after HP never responded to my email request for help."
2,So-so,I bought this printer and returned it next day. The 4x6 paper loader jammed everytime. The color and quality wasn't bad once I got it to print once successfully. I will purchase a higher end Hewlett Packard printer for replacement.
3,Watch out for the packaged drivers,"I use W2KP and connected the printer USB. The drivers that came with the printer stalled on the mass media device and on reboot trashed my system several times. Using the hp knowledge base I found issue with Roxio and Norton. I uninstalled both, crashed anyhow. I downloaded the lastest drivers and now the printer works great. Caution:::::::::Do a backup before you attempt this install and download the newest driver(10mb)(which should have come with the printer).All in all the printer is a good printer for the price, prints photos well(use good paper)and the smartmedia slot a plus."
3,"Good pictures, but on the floor","I like the features, simplicity and install of this printer especially under windows XP pro. My only complaint is that many print jobs end up on the floor. It has a very short out tray and ejects with quite a bit of force. I have had more jams-per-print than I did with my old 720c. Color is impressive, LCD menus are nice."
2,Messed up XP,"5-6-02. Just bought the 1115 with high hopes with my brand new, XP loaded, top of the line machine. I started installing the drivers and the system just started rebooting (3 straight times). I used my backup software to go back, and against my intuition, tried again. Same thing, only this time Windows XP came up with a nice message informing me it couldn't boot. Luckily, it has its own backup system. Computers are my business. Granted, I'm not a hardware pro, but that's ridiculous. I do believe its an HP issue, not an XP issue."
4,"Great printer, but..","THIS PRINTER PRODUCES HIGH QUALITY PICTURES AND PRINTOUTS AND NOT HAVING TO BE CONNECTED TO YOUR PC IS A REAL PLUS, BUT IT REALLY LACKS IN THE USE OF 4 X 6 PHOTO PAPER AND THE HIGH COST OF INK CARTRIDGES ARE A BIG MINUS, I FIND THAT THE EPSON PRINTERS ARE LOT EASIER TO USE AND THE INK CARTRIDGES ARE A LOT BETTER PRICE."
4,Awesome Simplicity,"Before purchasing this printer I reviewed a number of reviews... I almost opted out of purchasing the item, however, I am totally satisfied with the product. The ease of use combined w/ exceptional quality of print has made me one happy customer. My personal suggestion is that users use this printer independent of their computer (for digital photo's only.) Keeps in nice and simple. The only thing I would like to see modified is the print tray which catches the pics. I find that I have to remove each printed pic before the next one comes down or the ink on the bottom pic will become smeared. This is not a problem when printing 3 or more pics. It is a problem when I am trying to print 100 pics."
4,Great Picture Quality,"The picture quality is great. Can barely tell the difference from a print. The only problem I have is when I try to download pictures from my Sony Camcorder. There seemes to be a port conflict. Even though the printer is USB and the Camcorder downloads from the Firewire card, I must unload the HP program from memory before I am even able to connnect to the Camcorder to download the pictures. I am disappointed that the printer comes with a BW cartridge that is not large enough. After only a couple of BW documents, I am down to 80% capacity on th BW cartridge. I believe the new cartidge has a significant amount of more ink. All in all, this is a good printer though."
3,Will it ever work ?,"Installed my new 1115 on a pentium 3-800 with 512 meg of ram running windows XP. After install the computer boots to the windows XP screen the goes black and locks the computer. I removed all startup programs, all firewall, all virus protection. After 6 trys you can only use the printer after booting then plugging in the printer.After advice from HP I tried installing in safe mode, doesn't work either as you have to have a screen resolution of at least 800 x 600,, safe mode doesnt support this resolution.Any one got any ideas ?"
1,!! BUYER BEWARE !!,"The installation of this printer software fried my OS. HP did a very POOR job testing. DID ANYONE IN QA TEST??? Lots of Win98 problems with pages freezing and toolbars not working properly. Sometimes when I try to print it just locks up everything and requires a reboot.Everything is okay now that I've uninstalled the software and returned the printer.I see several others reviews experienced problems with the printer. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought. I would AVOID HP printers. Shop for another brand, it's not worth taking a chance on this poorly designed and rated printer."
4,Thought ...,"I just read Jonathan L Lewis's book, ""I THOUGHT WE WERE HAPPY: Lessons My Wife Taught Me on the Road to Divorce"". I wish I had read it first. I needed to heal the agonizing pain of my ex's affair and abandonment before trying to get on with my life. Ah well ..."
5,"Thank you, Mr. Smith","It is such a lovely, luxurious thing to read books such as this, which makes you laugh with delight at wit, which elevates one's mind without being snobby, while at the same time being quite warm and earthy. I can only barely wait until the next book in this series. Oh, Isabel, I don't know where you're going, but I surely want to come along!"
2,over-rated,"This is a non-mystery mystery. No crime is ever committed, except for a hit-and-run accident that ends up having nothing to do with the main plot (which wasn't much of a plot in any case). This book is about a busy-body woman who because of her warped sense of ""duty"" goes about interfering with other people's lives. This novel never gets out of second gear, and just coasts to a stop. I regret the time I wasted reading it."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to like this book because I love the author's other series, I love Edinburgh and I expected to enjoy it. But I found it tedious and rambling. I found some of the premises intriguing, and I did like the characters, but the book seemed to me to be in need of a considerable amount of editing. Also there were just some strange and abrupt transitions. I was very disappointed because I love Alexander McCall Smith!"
3,Intellectual Puzzle,"First, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing is so descriptive one can almost feel the highland mist of Edinburgh on your face. The fact that the central character, Isabel, is an ""older woman"" who is a part time editor for a publication called ""Review of Applied Ethics"" but is human enough to have a ""mini-crush"" on a younger man is another aspect of the tale I found charming. While filling in for her vacationing niece Cat, owner of a local delicatessen, Isabel meets Ian. a customer with a particularly unusual problem. He has recently had a heart transplant and is experiencing memories that are not his own. His story not only arouses her intellectual curiosity but also leaves the reader to ponder several philosopical and ethical questions. This is definitely not your run of the mill mystery."
3,"Friends, Lovers, Chocolate",Isabel seems to wander wordily through life and sometimes I become bored wit her musings. I did not continue to collect this series beyond this book.
4,"Isabel is a flawed, yet likeable character","This book, second in the series, is even better than the first. Isabel continues to be a delight, and the descriptions of Edinburgh and the surrounding area are wonderful. A worthwhile, enjoyable read."
2,"Friends, Lovers, Chocolate",Not up to McCall's usual entertaining stories. Very weak plot. He seems to be just dashing off this series of novels!
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"I am a total fan of Alexander McCall Smith and therefore lookedvery much forward to this book. Unfortunately it just peeteredout with endless musings about religion, heart transplants,foxes, Burns, morals and ethics........"
5,My favorite in the series,"All the books in this series are rich with imagery and humor, but this book is the richest. I love the little throwaway joke about philosophers in Edinburgh delicatessens, the anecdote about German professors, and the beautiful final scene. I don't like the central plot very much, but I reread this book over and over for the little things."
4,Prose for the soul. Life is good.,"Ok, I agree that the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency seems to have more flavor than the Isabel Dalhousie series - but isn't it because we find Africa much more exciting than Scotland? Because we find it exotic and warm and we are pleasantly surprised with the human universals we discover in Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi?My opinion is that both series have the same writing quality, it is just that we don't know as much about Botswana and its people, as we know about Europe. And it makes it a more interesting read for us - as I am sure it would be the reverse for the African readers.I liked the first novels of the Isabel Dalhousie series, it is a very enjoyable read. And the series gets better, I think. I like the warmth and goodness and common sense that emmanate from McCall Smith's prose. It just feels good, cozy even. No big surprises, just a book to keep you good company, anytime, anywhere, and to remind us that life is good (and we can contibute to that, too)."
2,Disappointing.,"I have really enjoyed this series, and was intrigued by the idea of ""cellular memories."" But I was so disappointed in the resolution of this book -- I felt like McCall Smith ran out of energy after writing the first 75 percent of the book. The end just petered out. I kept expecting some kind of ""kicker,"" but none ever came.The writing, as always, is smooth, and the descriptions of Edinburgh compelling. But there wasn't much else to recommend about the book."
3,Fun Light Reading with a Little More,"This is an easy quick read that I found thoroughly enjoyable. The characters are both humorous and interesting. I see my friends in Isabel's character. Perhaps those that are prone to overlook the nuances and underlying thoughts in life would find it dry and boring. As an analytical person, I loved it.And as an added bonus, we got a few things to ponder about ethics and psychology. In such a light book, I don't expect to find these deeper concepts, so I was pleasantly surprised.I do agree with another reviewer that the ending did not live up to the first 75% of the book. Never-the-less, I was not disappointed. I will be buying more of Alexander Mccall Smith's work."
4,Satisfaction of receipt of book,"Book arrival was as promised, and in the condition as stated. I was pleased with my choice of purchase."
1,boring,I had such high expectations for this book. The story line never got fully developed and was such a disappointment in the end.
3,Nice,"This is a small foot rest, I thought it might be bigger. It is perfect for what I need it for. It is low to the ground so I am able to slide the foot rest under my wing backed arm chair when not in use. The product came unassembled, you have to screw the legs onto the stool yourself. Nice looking footrest."
2,"Cute stool, cheaply made, and horribly overpriced","This stool is cute and this style is nearly impossible to find (most are big, overstuffed ottomans). However, it is very cheaply made (from Oriental Trading Co.) and the decorative brads that hold the material on the sides began pulling out after just a few days. The brads are basically like little short thumbtacks holding the material and they are not long enough to do the job. We will need to repair this by replacing with screws (so they won't pull out of the wood) beneath the brads. The $75 cost is something that might be appropriate for a nice oak or hardwood -- however, this wood is a very cheap, soft wood and is worthy of a price tag in the range of $15-$20. If you are really needing this size/style there is not a lot to choose from, but be prepared to pay a lot for a very cheap product that will likely need repairs."
3,IT'S OKAY,"I REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BIGGER. IT'S OKAY, I'M NOT RETURNING IT. KIND OF LIKE A CONVERSATION PIECE. FITS IN WITH THE BLANKET RACK THAT I BOUGHT."
4,Perfect for my needs.,"This tiny footstool is perfect for my needs: I keep it under my desk at work. It's cushiony and cute. Not exactly ""fine"" furniture but very useful and good-looking enough for my purposes. Easy to assemble."
2,Not so sturdy,"The legs do not sit flush with the wood it is being tightened to because the wood side prevent it from sliding all the way in. You cannot tighten the legs down without hearing the wood crack and split. Looks nice, but not the quality I paid for. Pretty disappointed."
3,Just okay,Looks cheap and the size is smaller than I thought. It was easy to put together. It does the job.
2,Stick to writing,"Many know or remember Catalino Tite Curet Alonso as the most important songwriter in the history of salsa. He has written for everyone, from Ismael Rivera to Pete el Conde to Cheo Feliciano. Very little know he recorded an album as a singer and for good reason. The album features 3 lackluster boleros and a respectful song ""Caonabo"" somewhat similar to ""Anacaona."" and ""Eres Mulata"" actually has some very good musical performance. The problem is his singing skills are not very good, he just seems so monotone as if he were just trying not go off pitch. I really don't recommend this one. He might of been the most important songwriter (God bless his soul), but as a singer, it was never meant to be."
3,"As with every Disney soundtrack, it's missing something...","This is a really good soundtrack for an excellent movie, however it's missing a lot of tracks that I wanted to have. For instance almost every track from the fight scenes, especially the from the fight in China when the composer actually used the Wong Fei Hung theme when the character shows up. Missing tracks, especially ones that I really liked makes my rating drop from 5 to 3 stars. I'm let down once again by Walt Disney Records. . ."
2,only one great song,The only song worth listening too is Tina Sugandh River of Dreams. She sings with great energy. She has a sound no other artist has.
5,Around the World in 80 Days (2004) Trevor Jones,i like the movie of around the world in 80 days. jackie chan the man that his now 50 years old he can be this biggest moviethe suondtrack i not have the cd or i like it all the music in my lifeby cameron stanley
4,This book looks into the honesty behind friendship.,"I thought this was a great book. It was very easy reading. It was just so honest and real to life that it was almost like reading someone's journal. I feel that it's defently geared towards the twenty something crowd. A story of mountain climber, best friends, torn beetween lies, women, work, family, friends, etc. takes us on a soul search. The book was funny, sad, adventours, and fun. It's not a deep book, but just a fun story of friendship and soul searching. So if your going on a weekend trip and looking for a fast read this is the book."
4,"As featured in Ken Burns' ""Mark Twain"" on PBS","This is a good example of Al's work in the '90's; his songs and arrangements are a bit more complex these days. The music is simple, haunting and evocative, which is probable why documentary filmmaker Ken Burns is such a fan. Two of the tunes from this CD, ""Dogue Creek"" and ""Shadow on the Marsh"" are featured in Burns' epic ""Mark Twain"" on PBS.If you like superb, emotional fingerstyle guitar, All Petteway is your man. He ranges effortlessly from Celtic to Appalachian to blues. He and Amy White have some wonderful holiday albums, too - perfect for background music at family gatherings or dinners.The only thing better than hearing the CDs is seeing Al and Amy live. Get on their email list and see them if you can."
4,nice puzzle book,"300 Chess puzzles ranging from Mate in 2 to Mate in 7, though most are in 3 or 4. Many of the problems are forced mates, which makes them a bit easier, but they still get to be pretty challenging. I think this book is ideal for players rated 1200-1500 or so.It's not as good a value as Reinfeld's 1001 books, but it's still a good value. The only downsides are the typical Pandolfinian cover hype (""Invaluable for practicing traps and winning opening moves"") and occasional errors. But it's still a good book.EDIT 2/08: Looking back years later, I think it's fair to say that Pandolfini wrote this book with a pre-9/11 mindset. I don't believe these tactical exercizes hold up given the new global-political realities."
3,Pretty Good,"This is my first puzzle book and I find it to be entertaining. There a number of errors and mistakes. I found a couple of mates in 4 that were actually mates in 3. I find that disturbing in this age of computers. If you enjoy puzzle books then get it. But, it's not the best out there."
2,tha rewiew,I have been playing chess for 4 years. Always been interested in how to checkmate someone as i was going to the library saw this called checkmate went home and when i took alook at it itwas disspointing first of the book cover is totally wrong itsay 3oo winning stratagems well it doesnt even tell what to do wht should first move be like it does not show u from start how to checkmate your opponent all it does is show a stupid picture of a chess games in its middle stages and u have to TRY AND CHECKMATE THAT OPPENent IN 2 OR 6 MOVE and it like that on everypage only reason i gave it 2 is becuz it kinda makes u move alert but dont be fooled by its cover cuz it doesnt show what to do at all
1,Lemon Laser Pointer (possibly due to switch),"This ""Standard Red Laser Pointer"" is of substandard quality and your beam mileage may vary. That is evident, right away, from the screws used to cap the battery barrel. The laser beam turned out flaky on the one I received. It would switch off, or dim randomly. It is likely that the switch is making a flaky contact. During a presentation, there are many worries on the mind and a randomly working laser pointer does not help that situation. The quality comment may be true of this item too which has a similar image:Instapark 5mW 650nm Red Laser PointerI also bought it from seller HDE which does not refund shipping charges even if item is defective."
5,Worth the price,"My cat loves this thing more than life. The cheap ones from the dollar store just don't last and the batteries are hard to get. This works on regular batteries, so kitty is never disappointed!"
4,"Beautiful, but heavy","When you receive the earrings, they are in a beautiful package. I was surprised upon first seeing them though: They were a lot rounder than I thought they would be. I had pictured them a bit leaner and longer, and instead they are like small round balls. They are also pretty heavy, but I have sensitive ears and they still work for me. That said, I have received many compliments wearing them. They are definitely very chic."
3,Damaged package but product ok,"The package was damaged and fish emulsion was leaking into the box, but the product seemed okay. Most of my plants seemed to perk up and thrive. I just added maybe 1/4 cup to a gallon watering can and added to all of my plants over a few weeks, then watered. Just as other reviewers warned, though, this smells really bad and your dog will likely want to dig it up if you use it. I mostly used it up quickly because the package was damaged, otherwise I can see this lasting a while if you only use a little at a time."
4,Perfect for the school year!,I was looking for a book to put my childs school memories in! And this was perfect! It goes from PreK all the way through 12th grade. Hard to find!
5,Great Memory Book,I look at several kinds of memory books and I had to have this one. I love how it has pockets for each grade level! I also enjoy that it begins with preschool and goes all the way up to 12th grade. It's big enough to stick their 8 x 10 works of art and report cards in. This is a great purchase to keep your memories in!
5,Deluxe School Memories Keepsake Photo Album Scrapbook Pre & K-1,"I had been looking for a scrapbook to put all of my grandsons school pictures in it and his report cards. This is the one! It has big pockets in it where you can just put all of the important things in it. I just love it! Something that your kids, or grandkids will always remember when they were in school and to look at their pictures to how they looked, will bring back memories. I would recommend it... Great price!"
2,Not enough places for pictures,"I thought the book was well constructed, and I liked how colorful it was. I didn't like that it didn't have enough places to put pictures. I wanted to glue pictures on the pages itself not just put them in the envelopes. I also thought it was over priced. I found basically the same book in Target for half the price. I would not buy this book if I had seen it in the store first. I have since bought another book by Crayola that gives me more of what I am looking for in a school theme scrapbook."
5,School Memory Book Preschool thru Senior,"I have always tried to be organized with the kids school pictures, etc. I have to say that I was not succeeding until I got this book for my son. It worked out so well that when I had my last one, I FINALLY found it on Amazon and bought another one. Now it is easy for me to put his school photo and report cards, pictures he drew, school work, etc in the proper page. Since I have a ""real"" spot to put them, I actually rock at having a complete book! There are also places for them to sign their name, put info in such as ""what do I want to be"", ""my best friends are"". ""my teachers name"", ""my favorite things to do"", etc It's big enough so that you can put inan 8 x 11"" piece of paper and not have to fold it which is nice if it is a ""treasure"" they drew, or a class picture. I love this book but not as much as the memories (and organization!) I have because of it. BUY IT!"
5,Great product!,"I don't think this should be in the ""toy"" category, but I love the product. It's durable and large enough that I don't have to fold my daughter's artwork and report cards in order to slide them into the pockets."
4,keeps me organized,"I like it, this could use a bit more space in the pocket and a space for the class picture"
4,sturdy and lots of room to record info,"this is the best of this type of school memories books i have found. sturdy, big enough with a pocket for work. really great. both of my kids have this and really enjoy updating it."
5,Fantastic keepsake,I love the pockets to hold special pictures and projects. Have only used 2 pages so far but can't wait to fill the rest
3,Better than prior model...but still underpowered,"The latest most powerful ipaq from hp is an improvement...but still is in no way a ""pocket"" pc or a laptop replacement.Just trying running more than one application at the same time (streaming a video and checking mail, etc.).Definitely not a device for the business/enterprise yet, but the promise is there.Only true improvements over prior models is a/v streaming (but not over vpn network, encrypted wifi, or while bluetooth headset is attached), and the VGA screen.Just try loading PPC applications with network drives mounted or browsing large corporate networks...be ready to reboot...and I reboot it probably 40+ times daily with heavy use.It's a great toy/gizmo...but definitely not a serious device yet.I'm still waiting...these PDAs are still underpowered by 400% or so."
1,"Great spec - expensive, unreliable and no longer made","I've had one for 9 months and it's a great PDA, albeit a bit power hungry for the battery shipped. Love the screen.But it's fragile, and when mine broke HP claimed I'd opened the case voiding the warranty (i hadn't ?!?), and wanted 270 bucks.I don't know anyone who still has one. Shame, it was a great PDA. I've heard they're discontinued now. But you can't spend this kind of money for something that won't even make it a year."
2,Potential not realized,"I have had my iPAQ for almost a year and bought it because of positive reviews and the high quality of its screen. I was just told by an ""HP repair status specialist"" that the motherboard must be replaced and there is no power to the motherboard. I only ever used it to read e-books, run a program called ePocrates - a medication database, play solitaire, and keep up with addresses and phone numbers. I could never get the wireless capability to work. It was reliable for my limited use for about six months and then began it's slow decline. I have updated it, kept ""patches"" current, and spent about 5 hours of my time with various online and telephone support personnel. I really miss my old Clie. My Dell Axim is also better than the HP."
1,Don't Buy From Amazon - Misrepresentation,Great product; however Amazon is misrepresenting the Audible.com promotion. They claim 100 dollars off the total price; however they would not honor the code! Audible.com was great and very understanding - it is a shame that Amazon makes them look bad.Amazon service reps were horrible they didn't think it worth their time to figure out why the code could not be applied to the HX4705.Buy it from HP - you get it sooner and better service.
1,LIAR FOR A SELLER,"Product turned on when I bought it, but would not charge. Battery eventually died, leaving me with an iPAQ that will not turn on at all. To make matters worse, the HX4700 series will soon no longer be supported by HP, so they cannot do anything for me! The seller never mentioned this problem, and VERY LIKELY sold it knowing he could not get anything for it. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
4,I still recommend though...,"Nice machine. Powerfull and all that stuff.Very nice display and much easier to use than many previous models.Some issues though:- Plastic seal/cover on bottoms begin to lift on one side :-(- Battery life time much worse then mobile phones- so much software and wizards in this thing, and it still says ""cannot connect for unknown reason"". Efficient troubleshooting is still a user-dream"
4,"Great, except...","Overall, I'm very pleased with it, but there is a problem.HP just published an update on their web site, that limits the volume applied to the internal speaker. Apparently, the internal amplifier is too powerful for the speaker, and without artificially limiting the audio level, the speaker will be damaged.Mine failed this way, and now it will be two weeks being repaired by HP, assuming that they don't decide to charge me a minimum fee of $85, and there's also the shipping.So, my nice Ipaq will be out of service for a while.And I was thinking about having that ram upgrade installed, which would have left me with no warantee.."
4,Nice Unit with minor flaws,"HP tends to really have top of the line Pocket Pc's and they hold the title with this great unit. The VGA screen is really amazing along with the speed and other funtions of the unit. However, the few flaws in the unit itself are the fact that the buttons are very hard to press and networking problems can occur. Heres the quick rundown:Pros:-VGA Screen is Top Notch!-Speaker is loud-Card Slots are good-Great Metal Finish and Feel-Speed is amazing too!-Battery Life GREATCons-Touch pad is hard to learn how to use-Buttons are hard to find-Rom is weakAll and all, this is one of the best units out there. If you are looking for a quick pocket pc for work or pleasure, this can really suit both areas!"
1,"Bad, Faulty Power Button possibly Dangerous product","Stay away from this product. I bought it for xmas along with two extra cartridges. Like everyone else said, I have had to fuss and fidget with the power button and now it doesn't work at all so I'm forced to dig through the xmas receipts and return the faulty product alwhilst thinking of a good explaination why Santa made such a turd. Yes we made sure we had the cartridge in, I've held the button down forever, it's just a nightmare and even if I could get it to work I don't want my daughter having a toy in her room that has obvious electrical problems. Sounds like a fire waiting to happen. It's going back for a refund or straight to the garbage."
1,"DO NOT BUY, DOES NOT LAST, POWER ELECTRIC PROBLEM!!!","We got two full days out of this toy and then the MAJOR power problem started. It's now too late to return it, and it's become a fire hazard. They need to just do a recall on it! It won't turn on, it takes about 10 tries and if you are lucky enough to finally get something to work, it stops within about 2 notes and turns off. We are one of the lucky ones who hasn't yet had it not turn off and over heat. It is sad that Amazon and Fisher Price have joined together to keep selling a product that is dangerous electrically.Now for the game side. Its WAY too fast even for me a 33 year old mother to do any of the games. These are the ones marked for 5 year olds. Our son got nothing out of this, and we are very disappointed that we spent the money for a useless hunk of plastic junk, and a sour taste in our mouth for both Amazon and Fisher Price. DON't waste your time or money and find a product that is not going to burn your home down!!!!!"
2,"Great, until it breaks","I read the reviews before purchasing this piano. I got it on clearance after Christmas and was skeptical because I had read about so many that quit working.My kids loved it, and we treated it as a lesson piano. As they cleared a lesson, they could open another, and they earned new cartridges by clearing others. I would have given it a great review, but decided to wait to see how long it lasted.I'm glad I did.I was the only one allowed to set up and take down the piano to minimize wear and tear. Still. Only 4 months after opening it, we started to have problems with the power cord. At 5 months, the power cord is useless.Was it worth the discount? Borderline. I won't replace it. But we loved it while it lasted."
1,Does not work,"Like MANY other reviews, this product did not work, brand new right out of the box. We will be returning tomorrow and will be getting a completely different keyboard. There have been too many reviews on here suggesting the same issue so we are not taking a chance on another one."
3,Not what we expected.,"My 6 year old daughter wanted this piano for Christmas. It was on the top of her list. Needless to say it went to the bottom of her Christmas favorites. It's cute and has a great concept, but it's too hard."
1,Only worked for 1 day,"When my daughter opened the box she couldn't wait to play it. She was able to navigate the keyboard and program just fine but the game stopped working after the first day. Try as we might to plug it in upside down, try it on several different TV's, push the cartridge in and out several times; it still would not work. Now I have a disappointed little girl and in light of the other reviews, I will be returning it for a refund and allowing her to pick out something else. I would expect better quality from Fisher Price."
5,I Can Play Piano,My kids LOVE this. They have really shown more of an interest in music and the piano. We have a piano and various other toys that have music keys and they are constantly playing the tunes that they learn from the I Can Play Piano. It's nut a substitute for a piano teacher but I would have never known that they love to play music like they do if I hadn't bought this piano.
2,Not worth it,My son is four years old.He absolutly loves music. The game is definatly not made for success. Its color matching to try and play a song is very difficult unless you go so slow you cant tell your playing the notes to a song. The part were you try to play along using suggested keys does not really teach him anything that fiddling around with a toy keyboard cant. Dissapointed!
1,Another dead piano,"My daughters I Can Play just died in exactly the same fashion as described by many of the reviews listed before. She was able to use it for three weeks, but now it won't power on at all.We've tried all three of her cartidges, made sure that they were correctly inserted, and have tried holding the power button for a full minute to see if it would finally power on. No luck. Worse yet, I swear you can hear a faint crackling after holding the button for 30 seconds or so. A serious short somewhere?My daughter loved this toy. I haven't contacted Fisher Price yet, but I'm hoping their customer service department is better then their quality control department."
2,Not a good learning system,"We just gave this to our kids today for Christmas. We were very excited about it and then very disappointed. Connecting it was fine. The hardware is fine. When it came to actually LEARNING it wasn't exactly easy to understand. My husband plays piano and I've dabbled in it, but we can not figure out how a child will learn ANYTHING by playing with this toy. It's more like a video game and not a piano teaching system.If your goal is to have a way for your kids to learn on their own and actually come away with some knowledge, this is not the way to go."
4,Christmas Gift-Not Used Yet,"I bought this for my granddaughter as a Christmas gift. Therefore, it has not been used yet. It seems to be sturdy, and easy to learn. I hope she enjoys it as much as I think she will."
4,Wonderful Educational product,I bought this for my 7yr old niece for christmas she just loved it. she enjoys music and this was a great start for her to learn the keys by playing a game. It also has diffrent levels as they progress in the games soon we will move up to a larger keyboard. There was no cons for me it was just what I expected it to be and we enjoy it. Thanks
2,Fisher Price I Can Play Piano System,We received this for Christmas and my daughter played it one time so far ...I think it is hard for her to play...you can not disconnect the plug and just carry it around and play which would of been nice. There are two games also to play but are very easy and do not hold her attention. I think this will get little play.
4,Piano Playing and Video Games in One!!!,"My 6.5 year old daughter received this piano as an impulsive gift from Santa after she requested a real piano. Unsure of whether or not she truly wanted to learn how to play the piano, I opted to buy something much smaller and more affordable than a baby grand! It has turned into a huge hit. She is learning key placement and understanding notes. We have four cartridges that she uses to mix up the games and songs. When her friends come over, they are immediately drawn to it and ask to play as well. Some of the games even allow for two players which makes it very user friendly for playdates."
2,A lemon but a great concept,"I am about to return my 2nd non-working piano. It will not play in TV or piano modes and once on, will not turn off without being unplugged or batteries removed. The response from Fisher-Price was they were not aware of any problems with the toy and to send it in. My response: Let me know when it works and I'll get one then. The only reason I gave it TWO stars is because it's a great concept and when we tried it, my preschool aged kid loved it.Hope the rest of you have better luck."
1,Broken piano = Lame birthday gift,"I was SO excited to give this piano to my daughter for her birthday. Unfortunately, it broke the second time she used it. Something with the connections. We returned it, bought another one from the local store, and it broke too."
4,May not be defective #2,"Our ""I can play piano"" stopped working after 5 mins so I went online to see what to do. I came across the review ""May not be defective."" This made me and my sons very happy because all we needed to do was make sure the cartridge was all the way in until you hear a click sound, then it worked!!!"
1,I live in the USA,"I bought 2 of these for my twin grandsons for Christmas, however they only just opened them. Much to my surprise the verbal instructions are in English, the box they came in is written in English, HOWEVER!!!!!!! the instructions when plugged in are in Spanish, we are an English speaking country. Nothing in the description said anything about Spanish!!! I will be calling the Consumer Assistance number tomorrow, and I WILL NOT BE HAPPY."
3,Baby grand,"Price too high for toy like piano with chime keys, ,presents much nicer in photograph, ,prefer Schoenfeldt pianos for children, price similar and sturdier piano."
3,Great idea but poor quality and somewhat difficult to use,"I got this piano for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. My first one did what happened to many other people. It stopped turning on after just two uses. My daughter really wanted a new one and so far this one is working. I think it's a great idea, but the music has been difficult for her to keep up with. I'm hoping she'll grow into it. She likes the games though. And she plays with it more just as a keyboard. It irritates me a little that you can't hear the keys play when the game cartridge is being used. You only hear the TV and I have to turn the TV way up to hear anything at all. Part of the way to learn is to hear what the key should sound like. I hate to give it such a low rate because I think it could be such a great thing, but it's probably better for older kids, like seven or eight years old and and older. And the quality isn't so hot for the price. I guess that is to be expected on the first run of anything."
4,I Can Play Piano - Fun For Older Kids Too,We got this for our 4 and 5 year old. They enjoy playing with it but we have found it more suited for our 8 and 9 year olds. It does take a parent moving the child from colors to notes though...the kids will choose to stay with the colors and never advance to the notes. Would buy it again if I had to do it again. We enjoy the toy.
4,Great book - a little pricey!,"Although this book is a little pricey, the best price I found was on amazon.com. They're still the best on pricing! The book is great, especially if you need some prep for an appeal."
1,Not experienced,This book was one of the poorest on this subject that I've read. It comes from a scientist who has no personal experience. Better information can be found for free on the internet.
4,Obscure possibilites technically detailed!,"An important book as it catalogs and details the full range of experiences one can have by astral traveling and the relation to psychic developement. Within the experiences reviewed, the author includes many step by step procedures to intiate the out of body experience as well as covering a deeply reasoned meaning or way of thinking about astral travel. The author is clearly a master astral traveler and has a knack for relaying a technical foundation of not often cataloged experiences. The only drawback to this book is that it reads like a technical manual and most of the time can be tedious to read."
1,The novice might find this book frustrating!,"I'm not sure that the author really understands what an OBE is! He describes it correctly but the methods he advocates are essentially guided imagery and remote viewing. The novice might find this book frustrating because the author's instructions really don't produce classic OBEs as easily as assumed in the text. The larger portion of the book is given over to ""psychic empowerment"" techniques. All in all, a misleading book."
1,Psychic Empowerment - Yes OBE - NO,"Since I can remember, I have been interested in pshycic phenomenon and many exersizes in this book get one in the right state of mind for paranormal experiance. The tips for OBE's however don't match up. According to the other experts, noone or thing can enter your body when you leave it. It has to do with the silver cord theory. The possibility of possession hinders many beginners from progress due to fear."
4,looks nice,"Be aware that the valves that these attach to are not available in my local hardware store in a nice finish (brass is available). To have shut off valves that look nice when visible after finishing, you need to purchase these separately."
1,Broken right out of the box,"After assembly I found that this item was broken right out of the box. There was a short in the pause button so the pause would not turn on and off. Great feature if it had worked.Also, this steamer is very light. If you are putting it on tile such a a bathroom floor, it is very easy to roll and turn over.Very cheap plastic parts.Spend a few more dollars and get a Rowenta!"
2,Problems just after 2 months,"I loved it for the first 2 months of usage. However, just after that short time, it started to stop producing steam in the middle of steaming. It waits for at least 5 minutes before it continues. I tried to decalcify it twice. It didn't really help. Now I wish I spent more money for a better one. Do not recommend this brand."
1,Beware!,"First of all, the item I received was defective. It was supposedly ""new"". No steam at all and the cord retractor doesn't work. I called Conair to be sure it was the item and not me. They told me it was defective and to return it to Amazon. I began the ordeal of returning it. I am a fairly intelligent woman, but not a particularly strong one. I could not disassemble it. It just refused, despite my useless attempts to put it back into the box the way it came. I managed to get it into a larger box and prepared to take it to the post office. Amazon assured me they would send a replacement. Then came another email from Amazon advising me that it would be SIX WEEKS before I could expect a replacement! The item is still offered for sale on the site as IN STOCK, but not for me, apparently!"
2,Buy something else,"This book wants to be a recipe book. But in my opinion it doesn't do it's job very well. There are too many simple examples inside (which take a lot of space) and can be found in similar form on-line. Also, the author doesn't do a very well job at explaining things the right way and it seems the examples aren't that well thought through (both the choice of examples and their presentation).The recipes explained in the book are not nearly as good as those in ie. Perl Cookbook, and don't seem to be that usable either. This book looks more like a collection of school assignments with solutions than practical examples needed by a developer. It may be interesting for someone who wants to learn Perl, but then it may also be too hard for beginners to comprehend the code inside the book (the explanations are not that elaborate).The list of recipes might look interesting at first glance, but if you go into depth with this book, you soon notice that it simply isn't worth it."
5,Great history book,If you enjoy history and you want to know about the First Ladies and their lives than you will enjoy this book.
3,interesting trivia - too bad the typeset is so tiny and feint,"Warning: Do not buy this book for an elderly person, people with bifocals or people who wear glasses to read - unless you can get it in LARGE print.I bought this book for my mother. However, the typeset is soooooo small and light weight that the words literally just looked like lines on the page to her."
1,A rather dull treatise,"This was very banal, badly written and repetitive. It could have been fascinating, given the subject matter. It actually grated on my nerves when, due to a prescriptive format, the same information would be relayed three time in one chapter."
3,enjoyable book,I've enjoyed learning about our presidents wives and their lives behind the scene. It's always enjoyable learning more about important people.
2,No New Secrets,"This book reads like a Middle School text book. I did not enjoy the attempted humor and some parts felt ""pasted"" together and therefore made for confusion."
3,Good Read,"It was well written, interesting history on the first ladies and their influence on the Presidental husbands, and the politics of the times. Would recommend."
4,I liked it.,What impressed me about all of the first ladies is how energetic and educated they all were. Most took the job seriously and worked very hard. Most came from money and status. All seemed to have influence over their president husbands. All in their own way were classy and worthy of the title.
4,oregonmommy,"If you like trivia, you'll enjoy this book. If you have only enough time to read short chapters or a few pages at a time, again, you'll like this book. Each chapter, which is about one first lady, is only a few pages in length -- perfect for bedtime reading for tired moms like me. There was enough information about each first lady to pique my interest, and make me want to find more in-depth biographies about many of the women."
2,sloppy,"Read like it was written by a committee, very poor editing. Little in it that I hadn't read before. Information in it was repeated."
3,Nice cookware set,"I bought this cookware set as a gift. The set is nice and durable. We had a family friend over who was helping cook and decided that he wanted to shake one of the pans back and forth on the elctric burner. Unfortunately he scratched the bottom of the pan. Other than that, the set is working well."
1,Little to do with C6x DSK,"I was not impressed with this book. The title implies that it will provide some information particular to the C6x DSK, but basically the only information that it contains on the DSK is that provided by TI for free. The book is really a cursory introduction to several basic DSP topics which are truthfully covered better in other texts."
4,It's an okay game,"the game starts out with this character called igor and he has this mission to find certain items (specifically, parts of a monster that he created) and put them together so the monster is back together again. there are obstacles and puzzles. Its pretty fun and in a way it's kind of like mario but you get passwords, you can't say the game. I think its for kids who understand the concept because you have to look for certain things. But i would recommend it to kids, its a fun game, but challenaging."
2,A small book about a great work.,"Those of us who love Douglas Moore's opera ""The Ballad Of Baby Doe"" have had to wait over 45 years for a book devoted to its creation. ""The Ballad of Baby Doe: 'I Shall Walk Beside My Love'"" by Duane A. Smith is a very slender volume which falls short of this goal. Although it is interesting, there is not very much depth to this text. It reads more like an expanded program guide. There is no in-depth analysis of the score, nor of the structure of its libretto. It does leave you with the impression that there might be a fascinating story behind this opera's creation and it's creators, but you do not learn much about what this story is. Too much material is repeated from one chapter to the next. Nevertheless, it does contribute something to the scant literature about what is arguably ""The Great American Opera""."
2,"20% unreadable, 80% boring","The first 20% of this book is written in a literally backwards timeline. Characters walk backwards, things happen in a backwards order, etc. It may have been a cute plot device for, say, 5 or 10 pages, but to have a substantial portion of this book like that made it nearly unreadable. Once I slogged through that, the rest of the book completely failed to reward me for my effort. It was bland and boring. Dave Lister lost all of his charm, and The Cat and Kryten managed to lose nearly all of their personality. Rimmer is the only character who not only maintained a personality, but actually grew as a character.J.Ja"
2,Not helpful,"I wouldn't call this an undergrad text. It's more advanced and moves faster than Rynne & Youngson. In an effort to cover a lot without much prerequisites, it moves too fast, introducing a lot of basic ideas in an offhand way. I found the explanations generally not as clear as in related books. No examples, few hints, no answers."
1,Do not purchase.,"I have bee in the computer business for more than 20 years and have never had such a shoddy shipment.One, a printer cartridge was missing.Two, I was not told I needed a different cable to conect. Also, why was this cable not provided as all equipmet I have ordered before was ready to go?This is the first time that I have ever seen HP be so poor; and, given their response on the phone, I suggest you stay away."
5,Very Practical,"This book allows children to practice everyday math skills that they will actually use. For example, if you have a specific amount of money, can you purchase 3 strings of lights, a tree, and ornaments. Depending on your child's skill level, this book is most appropriate for students in grades 4-6."
1,Very poor,"I read this book hopeing for some solid archaeological rebutals of the bible record. Instead all I got was a general statement that the bible was all myth and venom against anything that supported the bible. See Dr Yadin's discoveries and ivory houses. If I were neutral I would most probably be a believer after reading this, If the evidence against is this scarce to warrent this then it must be true."
3,Soapy-songs,"I bought this album to play in my home for our wedding vow renewal. My husband's family hails from Scotland, so the unique Celtic production of The Wedding Song was our immediate choice for processional. It was the only song we used. I personally loved Etta James' ""At Last"". The rest of the album was strictly average. A couple of songs were written for the afternoon soap opera ""The Guiding Light"". These were really cheesy. I'd rather loan it to a friend than encourage them to buy it."
5,Ordered specifically for wedding,Loved the whole album. It was used for a home wedding and was lovely background music during the breakfast. Great composition.
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"If I could give this CD a rating of ZERO I would! Never been so dissapointed with a cd ever! Will not use this at all, it was a complete waste of money! If anyone wants this CD FREE I will gladly give it to you since I have no use except for perhaps using it as a coaster! To explain all the music on it, it sounds like it is from the 80's! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
1,A real stinker.,This recording was a major disappointment. The five star ratings must be from people with a financial interest in the disc. It is lame. All uninspiring cover versions. Big waste of money. Buyer beware.
3,It's just OK,"I read the other reviews on this page and purchased this CD because of them - wanted to give my opinion- I really wasn't all that impressed, though the Etta James song is great, I wish I had just bought an Etta James record instead. Some of the other arrangements seem slightly cheesy to me - like elevator music. I didn't read closely enough to see that this was related to a soap opera, and wouldn't have bought it if I was paying more attention. Must be my giddy bride-ness showing. I agree that the Celtic version of the wedding song is nice as well, but won't be using anything else for my wedding."
1,Problems in production = Problems in game,"I am too disgusted with this game. I cannot believe that they would even call this Gauntlet. I am still in shock, and actually quit playing the game for fear of further disappointment. Warning to all. Go rent. Do not buy unless you have 50 bucks to waste."
1,Gaunt-Let DOWN,"This is the worse gauntlet ever, they raped the things that made gauntlet so good, Game is short and Story Sucks. This is A Value Bin Title For Sure. Game Over."
2,"Not worth it, but awesome graphics","Just adding my voice to the many reviewers who have already said it: this game is too short, and the gameplay is too monotonous.A friend and I completed this in just a few hours. That's not worth $50.The graphics are fantastic. I enjoyed walking around the levels, just to see the intricate layouts and cool effects in the backgrounds. Curiously, the cut scenes were pretty poor. I guess all of the development went into level design?It is clear that each level was painstakingly designed by hand. That is almost certainly the problem. Although this leads to beautiful scenery, it meant the developers couldn't afford to make the game bigger or longer. I think most of us playing the game would have given up some of the hand-tuned beauty if the developers could have gone for more of a building-block approach like most other games like this on the market.Avoid buying this one new. If you can find it used for around $10, take a look at the graphics."
1,Disgusted!!!,"This is by far the most disappointing experience I have had with a video game. I truly feel that I have been ripped off. I have been a diehard Gauntlet fan for many years. I have been looking forward to this particular game for a long time. Just when I was starting to enjoy the game, it was over. I beat the game in 5 hours on the ""impossible"" level. Midway left out many of the features that made the old games so great. This game is a complete waste of $50.00. It is a $10.00 game at best. This is the last product I will be purchasing from Midway."
3,What Happened to Gauntlet???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is my review to Gauntlet Sev........Wait a minute, this is not Gauntlet, this a mere hack and slash with no potions unlike the originals!This game is not Gauntlet, Original Gauntlet games had potions, keys, and a way to waste death.This one has no way to kill death and instead of only throwing projectiles like the original, you just do this,xxxxxxxxDownxxxxxxxxxxxDownxxxxxx, rinse and repeat.Although I have to say is that the graphics are very well done.It is to bad that this game is no Gauntlet game.Fans and newcomers alike, this is only worth a rental."
3,Pretty good,"Being on a Navy SEAL and Vietnam kick at the moment, I decided to pick up Darryl Young's The Element of Surprise. I enjoyed reading this book, but felt that Mr. Young was a little repetitive when it came to the majority of the missions that they were involved in. Don't get me wrong, some of their missions were captivating and different from the others...but it's the ones that were similar kind of threw me towards giving this a three star review. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in what the SEALs did in Vietnam under the radar. Some of the events that unfold within Young's book will drop the jaw of the reader."
5,One of the best books i have read,"This book was great, it told alot about Navy Seals and what they have to do and how they do it. I recamend this book to anyone who likes adventure"
3,Was a desent story,"It is informative as to how the seals worked, and the individual account of how his tour went. Not very well constructed. if i had to compare the story contained in the book, i would compare it to Pulp Fiction. the story line is complete, but bounces back to memories at the most random times, then gets back to the story at hand."
4,Dont plan anything until your done. You wont want to stop!,Author Darryl Young takes you from day one. His time in Nam is documented and tranformed into a story that is easy to understand and relate to. This book blew me away. Anyone with an interest in Nam would absolutley love it. It is a book I will keep forever!!
4,An interesting book,I agree with Roberto. I know the SEALs are tough people but I can't understand how one of the men can be on R & R and be on a mission at the same time.
4,So you want to go camping...,"So you want to go camping and you don't know where to go. Maybe you have tried camping and found yourself on a parking lot surrounded by the lovely sound of multiple RV generators. This has happened to me so many times that I decided to buy this book to help out with campground choices. One of the first recommended campsites is the beautiful ""Montana de Oro"", which is just as nice as the author says it is. Each campsite has a two page description with some background and historical information. It also has a list of ammenities, who to call to make reservations and what time of year is best for visiting the campsite. The prose is entertaining enough to just read for fun."
2,Camping in Southern California,"The book promised to show camping areas which avoided loud stereos. We stayed only one miserable night, rather than the two in our plan, because it did not deliver on that promise. It seems that any campground that cars can get too must have a host to control the trash that drives in to spoil the experience for others."
4,INSPIRING AS USUAL,Sue Richards is the penultimate Celtic harpist! Her music evokes the beauty and tranquillity of Scottish hills & moors while providing a bit of serenity for the daily commute. My favorite CD is Grey Eyed Morn but this one is almost as great.
4,A classic,"I purchased several copies to give to friends. Thomas a Kempis outlines the path for the Christian walk. Over 500 years old, it remains a classic, second only to the Bible in Christian literature."
1,Horrible Translation,This translation is completely unfaithful to the original. This copy cannot be prayed or medidated with. It's attempt to use modern language and expressions destroyed the beauty of this classic. It is not any easier to read than more faithful translations.
1,Molinari Dry Salame,"I had high hopes for this salame, but was really let down. Bland and tasteless, and I mean REALLY tasteless,your tongue searches your mouth for a hint of flavor and it's like nothing's there except a chewey, tasteless mass. The only thing I can think of is that Molnarihas terrible quality control to let a product likethis out of the plant. I have wasted money before, (I bought TWO of these 12 oz salamis which cost me more than $30), and this purchase takes the Grand Prize for stupidity.Deane E. Kogelschatz"
3,"Ok, but there are better alternatives.","I wish I had known about the pads available on etsy before I had purchased this. I bought this along with a pack of their regular sized pads. After you dry them, the edges curl and crinkle up to the point where you need to iron them. I don't iron my clothes, so I'm definitely not breaking out the ironing board for these things...lolAnyway, the handmade pads I bought from a seller who goes by handsewnbyme are much better IMO and cost about a third as much as these. There are other sellers who make reusable cloth pads, but so far, she is my favorite. I looked into the possibility of sewing my own, but it seems like too much hassle to break out the sewing machine, refamiliarize myself with its operation and end up spending lots of time and money through trial and error attempting to get it right, especially when there are people who already have it down to a science. The added bonus of using my money to be supportive of other moms makes me happy as well."
4,great but...,The idea and concept are great and when I am home then these are terrific. However if you are a workout enthusiast and where fitting clothing these are just way too noticeable or at least they cause me to be a lot more self-conscious.
5,The real deal.,"Shatters the illusion that one political party has a better moral character than the other in the United States. Zunes demonstrates that both democrat and Republican administrations have contributed to the suppression of human rights abroad, and if anything have added more fuel to the fire to extremism through their shortsighted policy. This book was written just in the wake of the Iraq war, and every prediction he made came true. This book gives the reader an excellent context through which to interpret current events. You will never look at the news the same. Think hard before you buy this book though, because ignorance can be bliss."
2,Crazy Watch,"This watch is crazy. It supposedly displays the day and date (in English) which it did when I first received it. However, about a couple of months later, all of a sudden it began to display the day/date in German, then French. Then the battery ran out last week and I've only had it since January. Very Disappointing to say the least! Not worth the money."
3,Armitron 1925P Two-Tone Watch,"Gorgeous watch for the Wal-Mart special price of $35. Watch looks great with everything and is extremely comfortable, I often forget it is even there. The only issue with the watch is the fact that the leather is fading out through normal wear and tear. Still a very nice-looking everyday watch, but might invest in a higher quality band for more formal attire."
4,Affordable watch,"This dependable and affordable watch is easily worth what you pay for.It's nice looking and even stylish with the leather wrist band. If your looking for a low cost, well made, watch with all the features, this is for you."
4,Nice Watch,This is a real nice watch for the price. Keeps good time and looks more expensive than it is. Only problem is that it is hard to see in the dark.
1,NO WONDER THEY HAVE THE BLUES!,"This couple had absolutely NO CHEMISTRY. They had no past together, no ""sizzle"", nothing. This had to be the worst story I have read in quite some time."
4,good cover,"I received this as a gift cause I love TAZ. I put it on my jeep liberty. While it does not fit perfectly, Cause it is a little to big. I did stretch it to get the puff of it to fit better."
1,Poor Quality item,"Made of a very cheap vinyl material - printing is poorly done - retention string snapped immediately after installation. Sizing is correct, and cover fits snugly, but for some reason the mfg. ships the thing crumpled up in the box instead of folded, so the cover looks wrinkled when you install it."
2,Cute but poorly made,This cover is poorly made and does not fit the dimensions specified. The cover tore on the seam at the bottom as it was installed on a spare tire size that it was advertised as able to fit. I kept it but not really satisfied with the quality. I should have expected this for the price.
4,A little tight at first.,"I bought this as a gift for my dad after he purchased a new 5th wheel. We went to install it and it was incredibly tight. However, I knew it would fit because I could still see wrinkles where I could stretch it and work at it and it would finally work. So I left it on the wheel for a couple hours with the sun shining on it and went back out to work on it some more. Took a few times and a little patience and brute force, but it looks like we got it on there and it fits very snug."
4,Just what I was looking for!,Taz is always kool and this is a great way to let people know they are too close. I like it.
4,A Tight Fit,"I got this item for my Jeep Liberty. It was packaged good and the qulity of the cover was nice. I did have a problem with the fit. When you first try to install the cover you notice that it is a little small. I worked with it for awhile and finally found a way to make it easier to put on. I put it in the dryer on low heat for a couple of minutes and once it was warmed up it fit just fine. I love the cover, the graphics are good and bright and the cover fits like a glove. I would order it again."
2,"Fix the camera, then its a winner","Just what I needed and yes it does lock up fairly often. But my real gripe is that this camera is almost useless. The light level is non-existent, and even well lit images are VERY dark. No combination of setting seems to overcome it (for the first week, I kept looking at the front lens wondering if a protective film was there). I do not have another unit to compare with, but this is bad. The WiFi works fine, and as a media player (the market niche for this unit) I have no complaints. Screen brightness is sufficient, and battery life is enough for a very long day. But oh that camera."
3,too expensive overall,"This is a smart device if you have the money for it.the good:'intelligent' remote - setting it up is a breeze.user friendlystylish and compact, you can keep in your pocket all day.the bad:baaddd camera, you won't want 2 record happy memory with this.stream video is kinda of silly since the screen is small.stream music is cool but only supports wmv!bought from amazon, referred by http://www.whosave.com. Hope my review helps you."
5,I love this thing -- so what if the camera sucks,"This toy is a blast. I love it, even at the outrageous $499 price tag. It's fast, bright and well-designed. I've had countless pocketPC's over the years and am quite pleased with the design, battery life, performance and form factor of this one. It goes with me everywhere. Just two complaints. First, the camera really is a joke, in that pictures are pretty low quality and it handles moderate lighting levels poorly. But, then, who really buys a PDA for a camera? It's nice having camera capabilities, even if they're not the best. Second, I've had just a wee bit of trouble with the wireless network streaming capabilities of the NevoMedia -- it doesn't work except for photos -- but I'm still happy with HP's hardware."
4,iPAQ H3715.. Nice little machine,"This is an attractive little machine, wireless internet and email works without a hitch, and with real player mobile installed i could stream radio over the internet. The screen is clear and responds well to the stylus.I found the handwriting recognition to be rather poor, though my handwriting is unclear to people too. Sound comes over well on external speakers, with a 1 gig memory card it becomes a mini jukebox, and again works rather well.As a personal user (i.e. this is my toy) its fun, it runs games well, and has usefully reminded me of my appointments e.t.c.. Bit pricey really, but in my opinion well worth the money."
3,Rating the HP RX3715,"I like the camera on this device, but indoor pictures do not turn out well, (much too dark). I had one for about 3 weeks, and it just ""froze"" on me. I reset the device, but that screen ""froze"" as well. Unuseable! I exchanged it and have had this one for about a month. Now, I just lost everything in memory. It's like the machine just came out of the box. I'm thankful I had everything backed up. Now I am not sure if I should just take it back, reload everything I lost or look for another, more reliable device."
3,Not good enough,"Beware of the ""cracked screen"" that happened on the previous iPaq. The camera is OK. No night mode. Too costly.iPaq Rx3415 is better $100 less. But RX 3415 is not available in US??"
2,Doesn't support My Bluetooth Places,Only good for basic bluetooth operation. The drivers don't support My Bluetooth places which limits usage with Palm type devices.
2,"If you need bluetooth for frequent use, don't buy this item.","Okay, so bluetooth works using short range radio. Let me put the emphasis on -short-. 100 meters? Yeah, right. At three feet away from my computer, my headset starts crackling. The software that comes with this piece is out of date, and if you want to buy it, it's about 40, 50 bucks?All in all, if you really care about bluetooth and want to do, say, high capacity data transfers, stop being so cheap. Get something better quality for more money and maybe you'll get results."
4,Works great,I don't know why these are getting such bad reports. I've had mine for about 10 mins and I've had no problem connecting with both my phone and bluetooth headphones. Works great for transferring files and listening to music.
4,Works and is cheap,What can I say? The least expensive I could find. Bought two for WII remote projects and haven't had a single issue. Two thumbs up.
1,You get what you Pay for.,"I bought 4. 3 worked. I didn't pay much, but kinda sucked cuz I was trying to transfer some files (drivers) to get a program to work and couldn't cuz one burnt out. So yea, you get what you pay for, dont rely on it, i wouldn't suggest just buying one, haha, good chances it will burn out, crappy circuitry. waddah u gonna do.Spinfix ComputersSpintronicsMindspin"
1,waste of money,the software is some sort of trial version that won't let you transfer more than 5 Mg at a time. there is no other software that works with it.it is really delicate. I dropped in on the carpet and it stopped working!!!
3,BLUETEETH,"Everything works fine with this product, only concern is the availability of the drivers for this item. Also the range listed for this item seems to be exaggerated (100M), I would say 30M is what they meant to say."
1,Bluetooth 1.2/2.0,"Junk, Installed the drivers for it's use on Windows Vista, and all my USB ports downgraded from Hi-speed to Low-speed. Sound quality was horrible. Used and tweaked it for a week, then tossed it."
1,Works but cumbersom,"Works but the UI is cumbersom. File transfers a %20 is added for all the spaces so a file named ""this is the file.xxx"" gets named this%20is%20the%20file.xxx."
1,Very basic use only not good for audio,Its max data rate is 1 Mb.I think this would work ok with a mouse or cell.It did not work with a sony CMT-BX5bt.A bluespoon connected well with the sony.
2,Provided Software does not support 64bit XP,"The unit comes with BlueSoleil software which seems to perform ok on a 32bit xp machine, however I moved to a 64bit XP box and the software wouldn't install. Went to the website, downloaded the 64bit, version 5 software, installed, worked in demo mode but when I tried to purchase (through the option provided by the software UI) I'm told by the site that the hardware address is invalid (11:11:11:11:11:11) and as such I'm unable to purchase the updated software. When it was on my 32bit XP laptop it worked with minimal issues but sometimes had difficulty recognizing BT devices which were sitting just a foot away from the dongle or had difficulty pairing up with a unit after it was discovered. OK unit for the price, but there are better solutions out there depending on your needs."
4,Good news and bad news,"Good news:- The price was great and the shipping was amazingly fast.- It worked on XP with my Bluetooth Wacom graphics tablet.- It's available in several colors. The dark blue looks nice.Bad news:- It didn't work quite right on XP with my Razr cell phone; it cut off photo transfers, so they only came through partially.- Although it's available in several colors, there doesn't appear to be a way to select a color. They sent me the dark blue.No news:- I haven't tested it on Vista, because nothing seems to work quite right there. Another reviewer said it does, so I'll have to give it a try."
1,OK Only for Limited Bandwidth,"I bought this item for use with a Wacom Graphire tablet. However, it turns out it can't handle the data rate for pressure sensitivity. The tablet/pen combination works, but only like a non-pressure-sensitive mouse.The product otherwise worked well right out of the box, but had I known its bandwidth limitation, I'd have never bought it. The feature listing that says it complies with Bluetooth 2.0 is incorrect--if you look under ""See more technical details,"" next to ""standards compliance"" it lists only Bluetooth 1.2. Even though it was such an inexpensive item, this kind of thing just burns me up. You get what you pay for in this case."
1,Problem using this Product,I'm trying to use this product with my laptop to connect my palm hand held. But I'm unable to connect because this product is not working properly.Victor
4,Excelente Producto,"Buen Precio,buena calidad,envio rapido, EXCELENTE (para el uso que lo estoy dando es un excelente producto)."
3,it works ok...,it is an okey product...worked with my laptop but not compatible with samsung's cell phone program...so it is up to you...i dont know what it will be compatible with or not....
4,works great for the money,the most useful 9 bucks I didnot need to spend ever. now I don't have to pull out my memory card from my phone everytime I want to transfer pictures. but it will not work with my canon printer. I will still have to spend $79 FOR A BU-20 ADAPTOR
4,"Cheap, but no driver","I got this so that I could connect my Samsung phone with my PC. WinXP doesn't recognize the device, and I haven't found a free full-functional driver on the net.However, I did connect to my Samsung phone and transfered files, so it works. I just need to find a full-functional driver"
1,"Too good to be true: looks great, sounds great... can't perform",I'm sorry but I purchased this product and the sofware was installed in two computers and either one can't conect to the bluetooth and other devices can't be read or reach or found. I honestly can't recomend this product.
3,Mediocre,Ok product.Not very sturdy construction but the bluetooth works well.Bundled software is terrible. (trial version lol)
2,Never received entire package!,"Your Package Includes: Bluetooth USB Adapter, CD-ROM with Manual and Utilities. I only received my Bluetooth USB Adapter, therefore I can not use my device properly!"
1,It never worked,I bought this low quality product (craftmanship etc) for a lower price. And literally it took my money for nothing.I tried several drivers for this product and none of them worked. I couldn't make it work on XP and windows 2003 after wasting several hours on this.I will never recommend this to anyone and suggest spend more money and get a good one.
1,This USB Blu/etooth adapter did not work.,I installed this item in my Windows XP sp2 computer. It seemed to install but would not connect to my bluetooth headphones. It came with NO software OR installation instructions. I gambled and lost on the cheap price. I gues you get what you pay for.
1,You are gonna get what you pay for.,"This thing is garbage. You are going to get what you pay for. I Can't pair anything with this. This software is garbage right out of the box. Spend more money and buy something that works. Don't waste your time. I have spent hours trying to pair this thing with phones, headsets and the like. Its junk. My phone can find the bluetooth adapter but the bluetooth adapter can't find anything. Its garbage."
2,"if you can't grill most days, don't buy this book","I bought this book because I cook fish two to three times a week and need inspiration as to how to prepare it. However, it seems that about half of the recipes require a grill. Grilling fish is great, but does Bittman assume that everyone has a grill? What about those of us who live in small apartments (i.e., most of the world)? Sure, I can do the same recipe using a pan, but since most of the grilling recipes aren't strongly flavored, the recipes turn out very bland. Even those recipes not written for a grill seemed somewhat bland to me. I also found that the classification of the recipes by type of fish makes it somewhat difficult to use. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this book; it isn't bad but not worth the price at all."
4,Excellent book but not quite complete,"This is probably the only fish cook book you'll ever need. However, it's rather thin when it comes to photographs. A complete photographic chart of all the fish mentioned in the book would have been fabulous."
3,so-so,"great information at hand and likely the most thorough book on fish i've found. sure wish it had pictures, but i knew going in it didn't. would still recommend!"
5,Fish:The Complete Guide to Buying and Cooking,The title encompasses the content: a comprehensive text on types of fish with easy recipes for cooking and enjoying them. A must for anyone who likes fish but is not familiar with all the varieties available for purchase and how to prepare them.
4,Not just a cookbook fun to read,"It was some time after I bought ""How to cook Everything"" by the same author that I realized that I reconized the name Bittman. Sure enough I had gone through ""Fish"" about a year or so early in my mother's kitchen after coming over to cook some fresh ahi I had caught out of San Diego. I read through this book simply because it is a great read for anyone interested in serving fish. Bittman has a way with words, it isn't often that I sit and read a cookbook for pleasure, but his knowledge and understanding of fish, buying it, cooking it, serving it were interesting enough that I read about more stuff than I'll probably ever have time to try. For anyone interested in seafood as a specialty, get this book, as for cookbooks in general his ""How to cook Everything"" is number one."
3,Everything but Tilapia,"I would have given this book five stars - all the recipes I have tried are fantastic, but the summary dismissal of tilapia disappointed me. Well chosen tilapia is delicious."
3,judging books by the cover,"When I picked this book up, I thought it would be an interesting read and a good adventure for a quiet night... but once I got into this novel it seemed to drag on and kept me wanting to stop reading it and not read the rest. The author has a great ancient story when Quin falls asleep at 13 and has a dream. During present day time (part 2 of the book) Quin comes back and hooks up with Jay. Sorry, to say, but this book has weak characters and a weak plot as well. Pick this one up from the library, not the bookstore."
2,Love this author...,"but didn't love this book. Read all of her books (favorite is ""Cullen's Bride""). Have been waiting for a book to come out from the author for awhile. Was very disappointed.As two reviewers said, the detail was missing in this book. The meeting with the family after being ""dead"" for 10 years was so short and seemed half-hearted. His death is what drove the family all this time. And to have the finding and meeting resolved in 2 pages was a huge letdown.The relationship between the the heroine and hero could have been built on and elaborated. There was no passion, no heat, no chemistry.I reread the book because I thought maybe I missed something. Unfortunately, no, there just wasn't anything there to read. Skimmed over her other books and they were great.This story was a huge disappointment."
3,lombard book disappointing,"I love the lombard series and have been following Fiona Brand for quite a while in the series that this spun off of in harlequin...The book started out great with the whole flashback thing going on but it was like there was just too much fleshing out that was left out, also the development of the romantic interest just wasn't there and it surely is not because of the length in format because the harlequin titles were shorter than this book. It was an ok read but not something I will re-read again and again like I do the other books in this series."
1,Phantom Book,"This item does not exist. It should be taken off the market. I ordered and over a week later, they tell me that it does not exist in their inventory. I don't understand why its still listed... very annoying!"
1,Simply put -- this ain't quality!,"I am returning mine. The anwering machine feature reults in outgoing and incoming messages that sound ""muted"" and ""tinny"" - very unprofessional!"
1,Not a Quailty Purchase - Poor Tech Support,"This is a poor choice for anyone who wants to Fax. HP support is nill. Expect to sit on the phone for over a hour and then have the tech send you a trail fax then tell you it works for them...goodbye. Then turn around and be unable to fax out or lose faxes stored in the memory. On line help is no better. I have waited days and still no response. I even called the corporate office in Palo Alto CA and was promised assistance. I am still waiting. No wonder there stock is doing so poorly, the have forgot the basics in client support. You have been warned."
3,Functional For The Price,"I've had this fax about 2 years now, with OK fax results. The answering machine and phone, though, have lower voice clarity and quality."
1,Dry Max Cruisers,"They changed the design of the Cruisers diapers. We used to buy Pampers Baby-Dry diapers for day use and Cruisers for night use. The Baby-Dry diapers couldn't hold in the wetness all night long but worked great for day use and were cheaper than the Cruisers. Now the new Cruisers can no longer hold in the wetness all night either. We no longer see the advantage of buying the Cruisers over the Baby-Dry diapers. We haven't experienced the diaper rash issue that others have. We'll continue to buy the Baby-Dry diapers for now, but we won't buy the Cruisers anymore. I don't know why companies feel the need to mess with a great product. I'm sure it was another bad marketing department decision. They always have to change things to make themselves appear useful..."
1,Crappy,"I really tried to give Pampers another chance. These were the worse diapers I've ever tried. Having a 35 lb 1 1'2 year old I decided to move up a size 7 from the size 6 Luvs papmpers that I usually buy. Unfortunately Pampers were the only ones that I could find in size 7 and even though I hate Pampers, I decided to retry them.....big mistake. Within 1 day of switching my baby got a rash. I had to change the Pampers every hour cause they would leak through; never had the problem with Luvs. The size 7 to me was no differene in size than size 6. What a waste of money to me. I have friends that swear by Pampers, however I cannot."
1,Beware--New Cruiser is a inferior product,"First, new cruisers was sent to me in old packaging the past few months at Amazon. And it is not a good product, it is thin, it has a chemical smell, new formula cause redness on my boy's skin and he does NOT have a sensitive skin to begin with, no elastic waist and the liner doesn't hug that well anymore... After using Cruiser with two kids, I am now happy with Huggies Snug one... And pay less.Amazon's star rating starts from years ago can mislead you from buying it."
1,Daily cleaning on baby mass and cloth,"After our baby grow into size 4, cleaning his cloth becomes daily routine. We are very upset about the poor quality of this diaper."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH PAMPERS,I just don't get it. How so many people can write rave reviews about these diapers. My son has been using Huggies for the last two years and I have been very happy with them. The only reason I had to order Pampers recently is because Amazon did not have Huggies in stock at the time and I was desperate. First of all the baby powder smell is nauseating. But most important there is the issue of leaking. I had three incidents in ONE week where my son's diaper leaked. This never happened to me in Two years of using Huggies. No I do not work for Huggies. Read my previous reviews and you'll know I've been around Amazon for a while. I am just one very disappointed mom.
1,Lower Quality and More Problems,I loved the OLD Cruisers. The new Cruisers w/ Dry Max were a very bad redesign on the part of Pampers. *Note* Layout above of diapers is no longer true. The Dry Max Cruisers do not have the Mesh Lining (3) and the diaper is much thinner. The padding also does not go all the way up the back like it use to. Because of these 'redesigns' the diapers leak a lot. They are also heavily scented. The smell is very strong. I do not recommend the new Dry Max Cruisers. If I could rate it a Zero I would.
2,size 5 needs to be recalled,"I have been a very loyal Pampers customer for my kids. Last year, I bought Cruiser Size 5 several times from Target, and I ended up returning 3 boxes. The paddings on the back were just way too short. After countless leaks both day and night, I carefully compared the good ones and the bad ones. They must have put the size 3 lining onto the size 5 by mistake?? Anyway, I was furious. From then on, I always open up the boxes and check the paddings right after I pay. I highly recommend everyone to do so."
2,The size 5 is not as good as other sizes,"I've been using pampers for both of my kids. The size 5 is worse than other sizes. It's thinner. Every time my little one used during night, the sheet was wet. So I skip size 5 and use size 4 during the day and size 6 during the night."
1,From Best to Worst!,I used to love this diaper that never leaked and now it leaks on a regular basis. I've had leaks that soak my daughters' pants yet leave the diaper dry and flat. The nice mesh liner is gone and there is nothing in the back of the diaper but a thin liner that you can almost see through if you hold it up to the light. Anyone have any suggestions on what diaper to use now? I'm pissed and I want my money back! Proctor and Gamble why would you risk your flagship brand with this crap! Now it's going to take your company years to gain back its market share.
1,"Used to work, now they are thin and leak","I used to use these a few years ago with my son and thought they were great, now I tried them on my daughter and am completely dissapointed! Well after using them for a week, I realized that these were not the diapers I used to use. These diapers are super thin, leak all the time and are worse than the Luvs. I ended up going back to costco diapers, which are wonderful thick and leak free! What a dissapointment! I hope Pampers recognizes this and goes back to making them the way they use to!"
2,MISSING THE MESH LINER,"I used to love cruisers. Now that they have taken out the mesh liner, my little girl is getting rashes. When I contacted pampers, they said they were ""experimenting"" and that some diapers out there had the mesh & others didn't (and there was no way you could tell by the packaging). They claimed to still have A liner, which I suppose is technically true, but it doesn't work like the mesh and leaves too much moisture against my baby's skin. It also sounded to me like they are phasing out the mesh liner in favor of this new diaper. Time to look for a new diaper, I guess."
1,"Buyer beware!! ""NEW COKE"" formula","This is the NEW COKE of diapers. P&G switched the formula on how this diaper is made. Ever since our daughter was born, we've religiously used Swaddlers and Cruisers and have recommended them to our friends. Well, this new Cruiser diaper is completely different and has a lot less absorbent pad material. I wonder if even the Baby Dry ones are different? Like most of the new reviews, the new diapers do not work and causes diaper rash. If anyone at P&G can hear this, SWITCH back!!! Please go back to Classic Cruisers!"
2,Not so good,"I found the front of Pampers diapers to be too rough. It gives my baby a rash. I tried different kinds of diapers, and it only happens when I use Pampers."
4,Still a Pampers Baby at 1.5yrs old,"My daughter has been a pampers baby from day 1 - literally, as the Pampers Newborn were her first diapers in the hospital. I think that comments well on Pampers actually - she was born in a high quality regional speciality hospital for mommy/infant care and they chose Pampers.Anyway, like others here I am definitely a Pampers mom and very brand loyal about it. I use the Subscribe and Save program here and love the convenience of having the diapers delivered right to our door - and who wouldn't love a discount!I also have to agree with the overnight concern though. My little one does absolutely fine during the day, but overnight there's probably a 30-40% chance we're going to wake up with wet spots. Depends of course on how much she had to drink the night before, her general health, etc. But certainly, I am never surprised to find wetness, and that's a telling commentary all on its own."
4,price on amazon,"Anyone noticed that Amazon is increasing the price dramatically? It was <$40 several months ago, and now it's $50???"
4,bigger size,Pampers could use a bigger size I'm the baby in ny family and baby diapers just don't work. Need something that fits a baby of 100lb so that could be like a size 9 or a 10 for big babies. Right now i am kept in attend adult diapers mostly at night but sometime during the day. Diapers are so much better then underwear get more work done without having to go to the bathroom.
2,Horrible for toddlers,"I moved up to size 5, shortly after my 11 month old began walking. He is now 14 months old and is FINALLY sleeping through the night. However, the bliss of my 7 hour sleep is diminished when I get my baby in the morning and find that the diaper has COMPLETELY disintegrated. In addition, the diaper stuffing is all over my baby's crib, sheets, floor, toys, etc... At first, I thought it was a fluke, but night after night, I find that come morning, the diaper has fallen apart. This horrible quality control problem would be laughable had this problem not been with a BABY product!"
3,$3 cheaper at Babies R Us,It seems like the price changes on here a lot - today it's $40.99 - it's only $37.99 at Babies R Us and they often have coupons.Love the diapers by the way.
1,Hate the new diapers!,"I though i ordered the wrong item and now I just realize that they change the diapers, these new ones are awful, they leak all the time. I am switching to Huggies!"
1,What's wrong with Pamper Cruiser??????,"My son is 17 months old now. He's been wearing Pampers Cruisers for about ONE year, at least ONE box (160 or 140) each month. The recent box had so many defected diapers I've ever seen as below:1. The diaper has Broken pieces??? It was packed in the package.2. The edge is stick on the mesh :0 If I tear them apart, the mesh was broken and got a big hole.3. Moreoever, my poor lil guy started has lots of diaper rashes since using this new box of Pampers Cruisers.I went online and did reseach, and found he is not the only one VICTIM from this so call NEW product development. You can find lots of voices of complaints there...such as [...]We love Pampers, and don't want to change this product. Please improve your quality, P&G;!!!!!"
1,Size matters -- Especially with diapers,"Like many others I had used Pampers with my daughter for the past two years and had found them excellent. She's moving from a size 5 to 6, so I recently tried the size 6 cruisers. She started leaking almost every night, developed diaper rash for the first time in over a year, and seemed uncomfortable.I still had some of the old size 5 Cruisers I had bought months ago. I took one and measured the width at the fold. The padding in the old 5's were 3.5 inches wide and felt much thicker and softer. The new 6's ranged from 2.75 to 3 inches at most. In other words, they not only substituted inferior materials, but reduced the size a minimum of 15%. Did they think my daughter's bladder wouldn't notice?Definitely do not buy this product."
1,"Was a loyal customer, but can't justify the price with the recent changes","I have been buying Pampers for my son almost exclusively since birth (he's 2 now), after having tried other options that were gifts or provided by family and friends. I always felt the performance justified the price, but with the recent changes I can no longer buy these. What was once an arguable benefit is no longer as Pampers has changed the diapers without bothering to re-brand. Also, as of March 2010, the product description isn't accurate - The mesh liner is gone and now the absorbent padding doesn't extend up the back of the diaper so they leak. I've switched to my local warehouse brand even though I don't like the fit as well. (I kept one of the old version, previously 5 stars, and have one of the new, now 1 star, to compare side by side - I'm not crazy!)"
2,Pampers is using cheaper materials for Cruisers now,"We've used Pampers Cruisers for years and have always been big fans--until the last box. Pampers has started using cheaper materials for the Cruisers and the quality is half of what they used to be. Beware, the new design leaks a lot."
1,Changes without warning,I have bought Cruisers before and loved them. I just bought a value box at Babies r us and they are completely different diapers. The description above does NOT describe all the changes they made to them. And what makes it even worse is there is no tell tale sign they changed on the box. I bought a big box thinking I had purchased the same diaper and now a have one hundred diapers I hate! I'm going to try and get my money back and start searching for a new brand.
5,Awesome,No leaking and less diaper rashes when we use these. Great at wicking away moisture so that baby feels dry. Holds up very well at night
1,Diapers fell apart and netting sticks to skin,"I have tried different brands of diapers (including store brands), but I have to say this is one diaper that I despise and will not use again. Apparently I got a bad box due to all of the other raving reviews.All of the diapers in the box came apart in the seam of the crotch. And, on top of it, the top layer (closest to the skin) seems to stick to the skin. I notified Pampers of the issue and they responded - which I appreciate that in a company.I am sticking with the Pampers Baby Dry line...slightly cheaper and more dependable."
2,New materials used by Pampers cause product to leak,"This product used to be great. We have used Pampers Swaddlers and then Cruisers exclusively ever since my son was born with absolutely no complaints. But Pampers recently changed the materials it uses to manufacture the diapers, and now they leak terribly! I have had to change my son's sheets every morning for 6 days in a row now - ever since we opened and bagan using the new package of Cruisers! This is very disappointing."
1,5 star to 1 star,The newly designed cruisers are smaller and much less absorbent resulting in more leaks and rashes/chafing. i have been a loyal pampers mom for years and have always been extremely happy with them. wish they hadn't changed them....am sure the new ones cost much less to produce since they are much less substantial (not that any saving was passed on to the consumer).disappointed.....switching brands....
2,New Cruiser Product isn't that good..,"I've used pampers exclusively since we left the hospital. My daughter is 12 months old now & we're using Cruisers size 3, the old version with ""Go Baby Grips"" on the package is far superior to the ""Comfort Flex"". They removed the mesh liner (which we liked as it kept the skin off the wetness) and absorbency has gone down the tubes. I drive around now & look for places that sell the old version (and buy those instead). Sad I have to stockpile diapers from the old production line."
1,New design is HORRIBLE!,"I have used Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers ever since my daughter was born in July 2008 and have LOVED them. I didn't mind paying a little extra considering how excellent the diapers were, but the new designs of the Cruisers are terrible. They leak right away, poop smears and sticks to my daughter way more than with the mesh liner, she developed a terrible diaper rash that keeps coming back. I pay extra for the mesh liner... now it's gone and I still have to pay extra money?! It's horrible, I will not be buying anymore of the newly designed cruisers and refuse to spend EVEN more money to buy the ""extra absorbency"" Cruisers at Target just to get the lining. It's ridiculous and I won't be buying Pampers products from now on."
2,leaks at night okay during the day,I bought these diapers for my granddaughter she is now 21 months old. These diapers work well during the day. But at night they leak and she wakes up cold and wet. I would not recommend these diapers. There are less expensive brands that work better in the night.
3,Great product but NO MORE FREE SHIPPING!!!,"The product itself I'd rate as five stars, and I used to order all my daughter's diapers and wipes all the time from this website. But unfortunately, Amazon no longer ships them for free, unless you join Amazon Prime. How very unfortunate. It's now cheaper for me to go to my local big box store to get them. Oh well."
1,Pampers don't pamper anymore!,"Compared to the original Cruisers they are half as thick. The mesh lining is gone. A couple inches of padding is gone from the top back, leaving only the paper shell for the entire butt. They are about 1 centimeter wider in the crotch. Maybe times are tough and they need to cut back on materials, but I'm afraid they are going to lose far too many customers who were once devoted. I won't dare put my daughter to bed over night in one anymore because that little extra absorbency on the backside is what kept her from soaking through. So now we have to resort to another brand for overnites. Plus during the day they are so quickly soaked that they need changed a lot more than before. So maybe that is their plan. To make us use more so we buy more. I'm very disappointed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'm not paying Pampers prices anymore for half the diaper and that's unfortunate too because that's all we have put her in for 10+ months."
3,thinner is not better,"we love Pampers Cruisers, our 13 month old has been in them for about 5 months now. But the last package we ordered was thinner and didn't have that top layer anymore that acted like a dry-weave to keep the area against the baby's skin as dry as possible. With a combination of Pampers and Desitin, our daughter has been pretty much diaper-rash-free for 13 months, but with these new diapers, she's developed a small diaper rash that vanishes quickly, only to reappear a day later in a different location. She just seems wetter all around in these diapers. Why do they always have to reinvent what already works?"
2,Pampers has changed their Cruisers!,I loved Crusiers over Huggies until I got my last box of Crusiers from Amazon. Three things have changed:1) The mesh lining is gone and is now the same material as Baby Dry and Huggies2) You can't feel the gel beads in the diaper anymore. There is no way to tell if the diaper is slightly wet or completely dry. I use to be able to feel the gel beads when I took the diaper off for my boy to go swimming etc. and know if I could throw it or put it back on. I cannot figure out a way to tell now.3) The baby powered scent has been increased 10 fold. YUK! - More scent equals more chemicals.They have lost me as a customer. Why pay more for pampers when they are now more like Huggies?
1,I am very disapointed,I used pampers cruisers at all time .But the last order is very disapointed me.I got not what I was expected.Those diapers is without absorb away line.And it is wet every time.Waste of money.
3,King of Diamonds,"I read almost all Wonderland Series, but this one I don't like it so much.Annie was a way to submissive and Karn doesn't know what he wants. But to be honest some parts in the book are good, especially the end. When Anne does paint Karn, there is so much love in this painting, that thru him off the hook, and he relays the true feelings, for his woman. It's a bondage book, newer then less, but some scenes are pretty the same, not so exciting.But for me anyway, Mc Cray did great job, and I like this author!So do not hesitate and by it!3 points!"
4,"Lively read, great summer reading, airplane reading","The story is clear from the synopsis and other reviews. I'll add that the book is a great read. He's a fine writer, right from the first couple pages you want to keep going. I class this as escapist, interesting, historical, offbeat entertainment. As another reviewer noted, there is relatively little on the ""law"" of the trial, which is a fairly famous case still occasionally cited (e.g. could he commit fraud by mail from England and be tried in a US court, where the letter arrived?) But that's of little interest except to an attorney, who can look up the case as a supplement to the book. Good reading, and a good offbeat gift book in the nonfiction category. Reyner also wrote two books on California, one light fiction (LA w/o a map) and one on railroad barons & swindles in California history (2008, The Associates)."
2,high pitched Indian frenzy,"If you like screechy Indian pop music you'll love this. These are fun Indian movie theme songs, many in a James Bond/sixties/spy/thriller type of theme or fake westerns. It's lots of fun but the sound quality is HORRIBLE, which is especially evident when played loud."
1,The wrong picture,Did not get the item in the picture the seller sent me something different altogether to me this is bad. A picture is worth a thousand words and this one is worth nothing.
1,NOT for children or animal lovers! SPOILER ALERT!,"Having read a few of Twain's books before I decided to pick this one up during a bout of insomnia. 99% of the book is sort of interesting, tells a story in a round about way and makes you care for the young girl and the horse she falls in love with. I'm not sure what Twain's purpose was here, a shock piece, maybe, on the brutality of old style bull fighting where a blindfolded horse was used virtually as a target in a bloodsport. But it was very cruel of the author to make us care about these two only to kill them off savagely in a bullring with the child cradling the head of her dying horse in her arms as the enraged bull charges.Do NOT read this book to a child, do NOT give this book to a child. In my opinion it should have a warning label! That being said, understand that I'm a 56 year old man and this story haunted me for days."
1,Horror story for horse lovers,"As a Mark Twain and horse lover, I was naturally intrigued by the title of this short story and greatly enjoyed the story until the last several chapters. The gut and heart wrenching ending for anyone who loves children and/or animals is disturbing to say the least, and I don't mind tragedy with a purpose. This was so bad as to keep me awake for several nights after finishing. DO NOT read this to children!"
1,i hated it:(,i should have read the reviews i hated this book it has a horribe ending i HATE this book if you want to read a good horse book i would reccomend Brigadier:Gentle hero its SO sweet
2,should have read the reviews first,"This book certainly taught me that you should always read the reviews before downloading a book. I did enjoy some of the book. I actually laughed outloud a few times. I pictured a young Shirley Temple as Lieutenant-General Alison. It was somewhat difficult to follow all of the characters as both humans and animals talked. I do agree with the other reviewers that there wasn't much story about a horse and it was a disturbing story. I'm not a member of any animal rights group but I am a horse lover and a former owner. Twain certainly did not hold back and spare any horribly cruel details. My advice is if you read this book just stop at chapter 10, the story takes a major nose dive at that point. NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK, I was always under the impression that Twain was a G or PG writer."
3,A good book with a strange ending.,A good book with a strange ending. It helps to be a Twain fan of course. For some reason Twain wanted a tragic ending to this book. This book is not something PETA would buy for there office. LOL
4,cool,"Mark Twain did really good on this story. It gives you a look into the life of a horse, not just the rider. Good read!"
1,Bad Read,This book is not what I expected. Dont waste your money or time with this book. I was very dissatisfied.
1,a horse's tale,"A horse's tale? Really? The only thing about a horse in this book was half the first chapter, and Buffalo Bill riding. It switched people alot, so me, a ten yr old little girl could'nt keep up. So, if you were planning to let your little girl to read this, DROP IT! I could'nt understand half the big kid words!"
5,Excellent and thought provoking.,"I am generally a Yancey fan. I've read several of his books and would say that this one and The Jesus I Never Knew are excellent places to start in his vast collection. His books are well written and easy to read without being strictly ""fluff.""Grace is a word that is bandied about pretty regularly but I don't think I really knew what it meant in actual practice. This book is so eye opening - I really felt like I was learning anew how much God loves me while reading it. I would recommend it for searchers, new Christians, and mature Christians alike, and believe that any level would be able to glean something from it's pages."
3,"Ok, but it got redundant..","I thought this book had some very insightful looks into grace, and its role in Chrisianity. The problem I had with this book is that pretty much all the insights could have been fit into a 20 page paper. I ended up having to really force myself to finish the book because about half way through the book, I got really bored with the rehashing of the same ideas. Worth reading, but I would probably just stop halfway through, you will have gotten everything the book will offer you."
4,Light weight,"This is a nice overview of the traditional way to look at grace. If looking for depth, this is not the book to choose. It is easy to read and enjoyable though."
4,"great patio shelf, slightly smaller than expected","I dont know why the negative reviews on this thing. Sure it's pretty lightweight, and I wouldnt use it in a freestanding environment like a greenhouse... but seriously up against a solid wall its plenty stable. I was actually surprised by the construction. Instead of the shelves just screwing into the sides, it uses these solid plastic retainers instead, sort of like a t-connector. They work really well, and add alot of stability to the frame, great idea. Simple to put together, it holds a suprising amount of weight (if a little smaller than it looks in the picture), I can see using this for a long time to come. Good buy."
2,somewhat light weight,I have also ordered the greenhouse and am hoping that it is a bit more sturdy.As it is I have to use pots as support to keep it from falling over.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this shelf unit to start seedlings. It's lightweight and the plastic connectors make it easy to put together, but the wire shelves don't snap in or otherwise stay secure on the frame, making it very unstable. When I tried to twist out a pole it snapped the plastic connector, rendering that whole section of shelf unusable. It just isn't a sturdy enough product to do what it was made for. It's certainly not worth the $37.44 I paid for it."
1,Gardman R691 4-tier greenhouse staging,"Lightweight as promised, but too lightweight and cheap. One of the brackets broke the first time we tried to put it together. Unfortunately, we didn't open the box right away and when we found out it was so not what we expected it was too late to return. Would not recommend for anyone."
4,just what I needed,"These shelves are exactly what they look like. They are lightweight, easy to assemble, and easy to disassemble. They are definitely lightweight - so if you need heavy duty - you'll just need to pay a lot more. I use them in a very sheltered area - and am not overloading them. The shelves are easy to attach to the frame with cable ties - which also means you can remove them without a big mess. I do with they had castors for easy moves, but they are a perfect light duty garden shelving for my needs."
1,It broke out of the box,"The cheap plastic pieces, and yes they are extremely cheap, broke apart on assembly. I understand there is a market for cheap plastic crap, you should understand that this item is firmly in that market. It should be listed at half the price for what it is."
3,"Bit Flimsy, could have had a better design","First, a suggestion. You may have better luck constructing the rack, then turning it upside down, before putting the wire shelves on it. In other words, instead of having the rack sit on the raised feet, flip it over and have the rack rest on the flat top of the rack. That's seemed to work better for me. Definitely be aware that this is a flimsy structure, and don't put too much weight on top."
3,Ok for temporary use,"I purchased this product a little over a year ago. It is easy to assemble, but just as the other reviews say, a little flimsy. I decided not to use it outdoors and instead placed it on my screened patio. I place my starter plants there; it really can't withstand much weight. After a year, the material has started to give in, and I am now in search for a sturdier, more durable product."
3,Dumas style - but you can find better,"The book reminded me of Dumas novels, though this book is more historically authentic - rich in epoch detailes and magnificent personages. Author's talent in describing the intrigue spinning courtiers and knowledge of historical facts is undoubtful. But something was missing - everyday life, or passion? What makes you feel the real life as if you are travelling back in time.The description of the mad king is probably the best description in the book. Otherwise, try reading Zoe Oldenbourg's novels - then you will understand what I mean."
4,I liked it,"It was a very good book and helped me understand the social politics that occured, helped me remember the details and the big picture of the times. The only complaint I have is that good relationships were virtually nonexistent and a few characters were flat. I did like it, though."
2,NOT CHEAP TO KEEP,"The price is right and does a good job of printing, but the replacement ink cartriges are extremely expensive. Unlike some other brands, this printer will not stop printing when extremely low or out of ink. This means that if you are printing large amounts of documents, you had better stick around to check for print quality or else you may get a pile of poorly done or unreadable paper. Learn how to refill your cartriges yourself if you don't want to go broke running it. Before you buy any printer ask approximately how many pages each cartrige will print. Then do the math yourself and figure out which printer will give you the best value over the long run."
4,Make sure you get the right cable,The printer is fine but you neglected to tell me that you need the UBS cable to hook it up. Being a novice I thought you could use your regular cable.... It delayed my ability to use the printer for a couple of days until I could secure the proper printer cable.
3,okay - configuring not so great,"It works well but it did take me awhile to configure. I followed all the instructions to uninstall things because I was running Windows XP but then there were no previous printer installations that I could find to remove as the manuals said there would be.I went online to download the driver which didn't work either.Finally I got fed up, uninstalled whatever I may have managed to install and then just installed the drivers straight from WinXP which the manuals said not to do I think, but it worked and it prints. So maybe I'm not getting the full fnctionalty of the printer...but I don't know"
3,Tough to confirure,"While the quality of the print is good,I had a very hard time installing and confiruring this printer.After 2 calls to tech support at HP,a return trip to Best Buy to make sure it was functional,and two calls to Gateway tech support,I finally got it going.It took almost an entire Saturday.I lucked out and got a tech at Gateway that was willing to really help me.(even though she said she wasn't supposed to)"
3,pretty good...,"first of all someone from holland has some issues..all and all i thought it was pretty good...i tend to prefer a rougher,less polished version of vocal art...with a raspy no nonsense approach to life, love and dysfunctional dynamics it is an album worth purchasing if female artists are your choice of music.."
3,"INITIALLY COMFORTABLE, BUT...","OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS I HAVE TRIED A NUMBER OF PILLOWS, WEDGES, AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO RELEIVE MY BACK PAIN. THE SIZE OF THE DURO0MED BED WEDGE IS PERFECT FOR MY HEIGHT. THE SHAPE WAS ALSO INITIALLY VERY COMOFRTABLE; HOWEVER, THIS WEDGE IS NOT FIRM ENOUGH TO KEEP ITS SHAPE BEYOND 20 TO 30 MINUTES OF USE. I WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS FACTOR BECAUSE I WANTED A COMFORTABLE WEDGE THAT HELD ITS SHAPE BETTER THAN THIS ONE DOES. I GUESS I WILL HAVE TO JUST KEEP LOOKING."
4,Great Bed Wedge,"Does just what I wanted, sleep with my fet above my heart. Allowed the fluid in my legs to be reduced."
2,Extremely underwhelmed,"This wedge arrived and is exactly as described. Size, composition, etc. Yet it absolutely fails to do what it claims. It feels okay for about 3-5 minutes, and then I just want to get rid of it. It might be okay for those who must sleep on their back all night, but I have a propensity to toss and turn. I believed some of the other reviews which claimed this wedge would eliminate that issue. It's simply not true. If you are someone who sleeps in various positions throughout the night, I strongly advise you not to purchase this item."
3,It was a gift,I guess it works. It makes you feel better when using it. You can't use it for sleeping. I don't have anything else to say.
3,Too hard but gets the job done,"I broke my ankle and needed to elevate it above my heart for a few weeks. I decided on this after the cardboard box method proved unsuccessful. Unfortunately, it's just as stiff as the box and it cuts off circulation. Since I can't find a wedge this size made of memory foam I'll look for a pad to put on top. Bottom line - it gets the job done uncomfortably but looks to be the best solution on Amazon."
2,Too high for comfort,I bought this wedge for elevating my legs. I have chronic back problems and needed something to help reduce the pressure on my spine. This was useless. It is way too high for comfortably putting my legs up. It was too hard. I went back to using a regular pillow under them. The color of the pillowcase is too medical looking; white would even be better.I returned it for refund
5,Does its job,I bought this item because I am pregnant and my feet swell everyday. I use it in the evenings after work to elevate my feet in efforts to reduce the swelling. The pillos is high enough for me as I'm 5'9 and the foam inside is quite hard/stiff meaning that it hasn't started sinking with several weeks of usuage and I have some pretty heavy legs. I'm ultimately very happy with this purchase.
4,Pillow Love,"After having fusion on my back, sleeping was at times uncomfortable. Now when I have trouble I just grab the Wedge pillow and wake up without pain. It supports my legs well but does take up some room in the bed but being pain free is worth it. Glad I bought it."
5,bed wedge,"As usual, I received my item promptly and it was exactly as advertised.this wedge is very firm and does what it is suppose to. The cover is silky with a nice zipper for removal to launder as needed.Good value for the money. I saw more expensive models elsewhere and cannot imagine why a simple item like this would need to be more expensive."
5,Great Buy!,"This has been very helpful in keeping my mom's legs elevated and after comparing prices, it is a great value!"
3,Knee and Feet lift,Too tall for knees and feet to sleep with or rest with. I'm not sure how else I could use it.
1,uncomfortable,"This item made my back pain worse. I am of average height, 5 ft. 5 inches, and my feet hang out over the edge creating a downward pull on them. Seller not helpful. Beware of return policy."
2,leg wedge,Pad is a little too high. Was very disappointed because I was told I could not return. So I am stuck with it.
4,Bed Wedge,This leg wedge does a good job of keeping my legs at the elevated position. It is quite useful when watching TV. Good product for its price.
3,Not as comfortable as it seems... for long periods of time,"RECOMMENDATION: Buy the memory foam version of this.I'm only saying this because I had pre-conceived notion how this wedge would work. I expect it to create a zero-gravity feel that would take a lot of the stress off of my back, in conjunction with my Tempurpedic bed. However, after about an hour my inclination is to kick it off. The best strategy in using this unit is to use it prior to going to sleep then you normally kick it off during the first hour or two of sleeping.When using with the memory foam ""comfort pillows"" to prop up your back, it works better, however I have a feeling you'll feel better with the tempurpedic/memory foam version better. The foam basically does not conform to your lower body as it is too ""blocky"".Spend the extra for the conforming version."
2,Eh...,"Size, dimensions true to description. Serves its intended purposes .. for the first 1-2 weeks. Then, I suppose like all foam-type pillows, it begins to lose its shape and support. In less than 30 days (daily use) the wedge lost roughly half its size / height. Essentially it compressed. I still find some use of it, though now I have to 'supplement' its height by placing a regular pillow on top.Kind of defeats the purpose. I don't know that a reasonably comfortable foam wedge pillow exist that will maintain its shape for a lifetime. If one exist, it's not this one!"
3,Ortho Wedge,"I am not able to sleep all night with the wedge under my legs because it is too high. It works well for my back, but my legs are not comfortable sitting up so high."
5,Review Duro Med Orthro Bed Wedge,I fist used this item during my physical thearpy. I had injured my arm and when they gave me hot packs they elevated my legs with this item. It is great and I would give it an A+++++. It is good for a multitude of things. Acid reflux but it relieves pressure on your back and makes it feel absolutely wonderful. My husband and I use it all the time.
1,Smells,Item had a pungent odor when I removed it from the plastic wrapping. I aired the item out for two weeks hoping the odor would dissapate but it did not. I returned the item for credit.
3,Very firm support,The foam is a little too firm for someone with a severe leg fracture otherwise it is satisfactory. Very economically priced.
2,Very uncomfortable for a short person,I am 5 foot tall with a DVT in the right leg and needed a leg elevation product. The price was right and shipping was quick but it just was not comfortable for me.
5,Good product,"Nice and big and the foam is really tough too which means it won't compress and get smashed. We use this to prop my wheelchair bound father up when he is eating in his hospital bed, which does not lift him up enough, vertically. He needs to be sitting fully straight to not choke on his food and this product definitely helps him in that area. Great product and could be used under the legs as well as. And, as always, Amazon Prime is #1."
5,Duro-Med Ortho Bed Wedge,This product is great. It reduces swollen ankles in the morning plus it is great for the lower back. Definitly a great buy and a great price also!
3,Leg Support,"This is great if your a back sleeper, if not you may want to consider using a pillow, otherwise it's a good experience."
1,Still Waiting!!!!!!!! :-{,"I ordered this along with a wedge May 1st. I have had the wedge from Amazon for about a week and love it. This one was not shipped until the 11th (ten days) and is now sitting in Spokane,WA. That is just a few ours up I-5 from me. It isn't scheduled to arrive until the 24th, a week after it is needed! I guess they must be sending it by walking messenger!"
1,DON'T ORDER THIS ITEM IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT IT,"Find another provider. I ordered mid-February, and was told 2-4 weeks for delivery. On March 19, that changed to April 18-May 2. I cancelled the order. Unless you can wait months on end for the product, don't order it! I just called another company (Healthy Back Store) and ordered similar product and will have it next week. If you're experiencing back pain or CHF, don't wait for this!"
1,WOW,"I would like to tell you about this product, however I never received it.I ordered it in early part of January and Amazon replied that it would ship between Jan. 20th and Jan. 31st. Today is Jan. 31st. Have not received the product. Went on Amazon to check ""Where's my stuff"" . It read that my new shipping wait is now Feb.20 to Feb. 30th . Sorry very displeased."
4,"Works, but somewhat short and too firm",I used this for a few months after I broke my right ankle. I put a thin memory foam pillow over the top to make it softer as well as to support my longer than average leg. I think they could put a memory foam/gel layer over the top to make it softer.Other than those two small issues this does a great job of stably elevating the foot to reduce inflammation. This is much better than stacking pillows and it keeps the knee bent at an angle instead of hyper-extended.
4,Great but height needed adjusting for me. :),"Firm and comfortable for my legs. My legs swell during the day and this wedge really helps when I sleep at night. The only thing I didn't do was measure to see how high 10"" would be on my bed. Sort of tall for me. So I just took a sharp long blade and cut off about 2"" of the height and it is even better now."
2,Oxford's product is superior,"Absence of notes is very unhelpful. Oxford's literary Classic edition much more useful. Norton's collection of biographical snippets and criticism not very through or wide-ranging -- supplemental materials mostly available on Googlebooks, anyway -- why bother? Typeface is crisp. Paperstock durable, but makes item rather heavy for size. Coverart lackluster. Oxford's product superior in almost everyway.Jane Eyre (Oxford World's Classics)"
4,Super Mario Bros. Movie Madness,I ordered this cartoon because I thought it was unusual looking and I didn't have it. But people....be warned! Don't buy this if you already own the SUPER MARIO BROS.SUPER SHOW box sets on DVD! The 5 episodes on this DVD is from the SUPER SHOW cartoon! I didn't know that when I ordered it! I'll probably just give this to my niece now.
2,Where's the live-action part?,"I found this in a bargain bin in some store and I had no idea what it was. When I purchased it, it turned out to be five episodes of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. Why couldn't they just call it that. What sucks is that the live action part of the show is completely gone with just the cartoon shows left. The episode included are Star Koopa, Toad Warriors, Robo Koopa, On Her Majesty's Sewer Service, and Raiders of the Lost Mushroom. The show is pretty funny if extremely corny, but if you are a fan of the show I suggest searching for a boxed set instead of this."
5,Mario DVD,"This was purchased as a gift for my 5 year old grandson. I haven't watched the DVD, but I haven't heard of any problems with it. Shipping was quick. Everything went great."
4,lack of satisfaction: wanna see more Super Mario Bros.,"I want to see more of the New Super Mario Bros, or Super Mario World. i am not as addicted to the Mario Bros. as I am with The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I love the turtles. I grew up watching the original series. I will collect all the episodes regardless of how much money I do spend. Hey, it's worth spending money on something that really interests you. How do I feel about the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the movie ""TMNT""? Well, it is not as intense, entertaining, and emotional as the original one and the following three movies in which the turtles were real. They were not 3D animated like TMNT. The original is always better than something that duplicates it. Today's music and TV shows are crappy, senseless, and a waste of someone's time."
5,Mario and Star Wars,"If your kids love Mario and Star Wars - then this is a must buy. My kids love it. They keep running around saying, ""May the PASTA be with you.""."
5,pool recreation,"Item was missing a piece, However customer service was GREAT and addressed this issue QUICKLY and professionally. Would definitely do more business with this company in the future."
2,Unblushing Narcissism/User Unfriendly,The author spends a great deal of time describing his models and methods (referred to by highly forgettable acronyms) as if they were standards of practice. The writing is not easy to read and the organization of the material and poor indexing do not facilitate use as a reference. A lack of problems and exercises (as well as the use of non-standard terminology) makes the book hard to use as a classroom text.There are much better book available that cover this material.
1,This company sends you a 2009 tracking number when you request the shipping info for 2010...,"Do NOT deal with this supplier, as they send you a 2009 tracking number for a September 2010 tracking request."
3,farmers reserve,Not my favorite of mmw but still a must for the fan----basically one song/jam that progresses rather slowly. Anthony hanley
3,Good intentions,"This product was exactly as specified in the description. However, I discovered that enclosing one's feet can sometimes be rather hot, even though protecting them is the plan. This is not a fault of the product, but a discovery made by the consumer!"
1,Another victim,I can add nothing to those comments already made except to say that I was also victimized. My buying habits will be revised.
1,What a waste of time! Don't do it!,"Complete waste of time. Just go to your local store and buy an upgrade. I wish I too had read the reviews before buying. I could have purchased an off the shelf upgrade and been running the same day... but instead here I sit waiting for a $5 DVD to arrive, and not able to join the company domain. Windows ""Anytime"" Upgrade is not a misnomer! It may happen at ANY TIME (as long as you're not expecting it ANYTIME SOON!). It's been 18 days since I received ""Ship Notification"" and still nothing. Unbelievable."
1,Ripoff!,"I'm joining the chorus of angry folks. Looking at the dates of their reviews, Amazon is inexcusably slow in changing the patently untrue website.My respect for them went down a good bit, and I'll think twice before buying again.I just wish I'd read the reviews first......"
1,NOT DOWNLOADABLE,"If you are buying this DVD on Amazon because availability says download now, DON'TThis software is not available for download! I purchased it; called support 3 times before I finally got an answer that the page is wrong. PLUS they refused to give me a refund, because it is NON-refundable. They make a mistake and the customer eats the cost...."
4,"Quick, easy read","I have read a LOT of stories by Nora Roberts and she is definitely a good writer. This book is well written with a nice flow. It is also a relatively simple love story without much suspense or intrigue. Its a feel good story where the hero and heroine have some minor issues to overcome, which they do quickly toward the end of the story. All the good people are beautiful and just as nice as can be and the villian is quickly overcome. The setting is gorgeous and in the end everyone lives happily ever after. Recommended for young readers or someone who is just wanting some light reading."
4,Revisit the Grants....,"New story with some old friends & some new additions. Ah, there's nothing more interesting than a Hot Blooded, Passionate Celtic, add the fact there are 2 of them with Brian & Keeley, you've a great Sexy Romantic tale. So if you enjoy, love conguers all & lovely happy endings this is the book for you. Ms. Roberts does such fine detail, rarely misses (was she a Bard in her past life?)... and she hasn't here. Blessed be, Srainte(health)"
4,love that irish sizzle!,"i absolutely love the characters of these books. in irish rebel we are yet again introduced to a young (this time male) man who comes over to work the horse ranch from ireland. the sparks fly between him and keeley almost at first sight and im not only speaking about desire. once they are able to hold a conversation without yelling at one another, they realize their true feelings. this book keeps you laughing as you turn the pages and sooner than you want, its over. i hope there will be more about the other kids! ::smile"
5,great book,Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors . I especially enjoy those with Irish links. This story also involved Horses and people with a passion for them and their beauty and spirit. The complexity of coming to age and making choices verses how events as well as dreams evolve in life. In trilogy series of this author we also get a glimpse of how life is going for previous characters.
4,Nora does it again!,"I really liked this book for the way Nora Roberts uses her characters in understandable, realistic and romantic ways. Her books are fun to read because they are not full of overly sweet romantic mess. They are more like a real romantic couple . . . and I like that."
5,awesome product,"Mounted this on the wall outside my house (concrete). Had to make a trip to home depot spent $10 dollars, 4- 5/8 2inch screws, 4- 5/8 concrete anchors, 1- 2inch drill bit for concrete. works great, I have to bring my bag indoors when not in use because of rain, but the mount is very stable. No complaints."
2,Bolt broke,"The bottom bolt broke a week after purchase, which prevents the unit from functioning as designed; it cannot swing out of the way."
4,Solid CD,"This album is all around good. It hooks you in and doesn't let go. It's not a perfect album by any means, but it is entertaining. It's nice to have at least one artist around who just sarts to shoot off at the mouth about whatever he feels like. Keep it up Kid Rock, politically incorrect folks out there need someone like you in the music industry."
5,"Devil Without A Cause, one step ahead of the rest of the gam","This album is a wonderful masterpiece, that is a must have. I listen to anything from ICP, Esham, Everlast, Limp Bizkut, Jay Z, Britney Spears, Master P, and Korn. I love this album because it cleverly combines a mixture of rap and rock, in such an awesome way it's amazing! I also went to see Rock in concert on his ""White Trash On Dope Tour"" and he put on a sweet show. He is a must see. 500 stars from Oley."
4,only kid rock knows why...,"The reason this album is too sweet is one song;""Only God Knows Why."" This song is the measuring stick to all the potential Kid Rock has. Sure, I too was lured in by ""I Am the Bullgod,"" but with songs like the forementioned and ""Cowboy,"" this album is a must own...and for all of you, it's not country-esque, it's roots rock and it sure does rock!"
1,Is this suppose to be country?,"As an avid country music lover, I was highly offended when I heard Kid Rock's attempt at country on this terrible waste of plastic. This isn't exactly line dancing music and the rap and metal influences don't help his country music at all! Garth Brooks would be sickened if he heard some of these songs!!!"
5,VERY GOOD CD!!! YOU MUST BUY!!!!,"YOU MUST BUY THIS CD!!!! it kicks almighty a$$!! if you like Limp Bizkit, then you'll definiteley like this, my favorite songs on here are ""BAWITDABA"", ""COWBOY"", and ""I AM THE BULLGOD"" this CD is one of the best in a long time, right up in there with Limp Bizkit's Significant Other.peace out"
2,"Classic case of Good Song, Bad CD.","When I first heard Bawitdaba on MTV, i was immediately hooked. Myself being a heavy metal fan, I went and bought the CD only to find a mix of rap, jazz, and who knows what else. The only other somewhat interesting(at the most) song is I am the Bullgod. This is clearly an expression of a very confused person who can't make up his mind about music style."
3,"Some good songs, but overall not a great album","I was so excited when I first opened Kid Rock's album, Devil Without a Cause. I was expecting some hard rock with lots of guitars, drums, and more. Although I really liked ""Bawitdaba"", Some of the other songs on the album were just plain horrible, like ""Cowboy"" and ""Wasting Time"". I was pretty dissapointed. I still listen to the cd, but I really don't enjoy it that much. I'm not sorry I bought it, but I think it was kind of a waste of time."
1,"kid rock doesn't ""rock""",kid rock is the worst artist i have ever seen. he has no talent at all and i have no idea how he got a record out. be smart and don't buy this cd!
1,1 HIT WONDER,"I expected a lot from this CD, because of Bawitiba. It was a HUGE dissapointment. Bawitiba is the only good track on here and it was a waste of my money. I don't recommend this one for anyone."
1,BAD MUSIC,I don't happen to like rap but was amazed when I found out that the singer of a song who I did'nt know who the artist was turned out to be him. I have no use for the rest of the album except for God Only Knows Why.
4,much better than history of rock,"This cd features great beats on singles like only god knows why, i am the bullgod, cowboy, bawitdaba, wasting time, and devil without a cause, to name a few that i've heard elsewhere besides the album. Kid refers to a lot of the same things in different songs like being a so-called 'pimp' for instance. But vulgarity overwhelm featuring drugs, violence, and sex. Kid does the Will Smith ""I'm so great"" theme. Which isn't a terribly bad thing but can seem annoying."
4,Name of Review,"Kid rock is one of my heroes..... His album is a masterpiece-awesome lyrics, backed by the awesome funk-metal fury of Twisted Brown Trucker. Good rapping, lots of attitude, and showing a wide field of influences. He also shows a softer side (Only God Knows Why), and his song Black Chick, White Guy is an interesting and true story featuring some great rhyming."
5,Detroit Rocker,"Growing up in a Detroit suburb, I got to hear real rappers and funk before it was commercialized. This album brings back that reality and speaks for much of the anger seen in GenX-ers and non-Boomers. Kid Rock even throws in some Grandmaster Flash, one of those original rappers when the songs meant something. The past couple years has seen very few good rappers, most just running their mouths with their hands out for ""twenties and tens"". Going platinum...."
1,... trash,i'm so let down. now i'm going to have to take down all my kid rock posters and kid rock bed sheets and kid rock cereal spoon and my kid rock lunchbox. i'm going to let my membership in the kid rock fan club expire. i must be getting too old. now that i'm in the fourth grade i think i'm going to start listening to limp bizkit.i'm going to do it all for the nookie...
1,Yea I love rap/rock so much.......,"Remember when the motor city used to produce musicians of note (kiss or Ted Nugent) now Detroit produces white trash like em and em and kid rock, wow I heard Detroit was a dump of a city and looking at what it produces musically I can say that Detroit is one disgusting place. This is music to empty your stomach to."
1,"Awful, never again","This store is awful, I ordered the cd in December and it has yet to arrive in the start of Febuary. I have ordered engine parts which arrived much faster than this cd. Dont buy from here!"
1,I can't believe people listen to this garbage,"I am so thankful that all of these songs are out of radio rotation, because this jerk has created some of the worst music that America has ever witnessed. If you gave this album any more than two stars you should get your head checked."
2,Two worthy tracks,"Only number 2 and 11 are worthwhile.... The rest is justcrap. The problem is that the more he reveiled himselfto be a redneck the more I became to hate him. I justcan't give hicks any credit. Back to the album, I guessCowboys is ok... None of these tracks are classics though..I threw this cd in the trash two years ago when I foundout what Kid Rock really is."
4,A lot better than I thought it would be,"""Devil Without A Cause"" is a lot better than I thought it would be. It opens up with ""Bawitdaba"", which is one of the best song's on the CD. My other favorites are ""Devil Without A Cause"", ""I Am The Bullgod"" and ""F-ck Off"". If you like rap-rock than you should get this CD."
3,"Worth it, but nothin' groundbreaking","Although Kid Rock isn't deserving of his Best New Artist Grammy nomination, he sure knows how to make a mindless party album. ""Wasting Time"" is the core of the fun--mixing booze & weed with a bouncy Fleetwood Mac sample. The other radio hits have become anthems--including ""God Only Knows Why"" which adds a much-needed emotional layer to the album."
5,New Fan,"My first Kid Rock CD and I'm hooked. Can't seem to turn it off. Each time through it gets better. Sounds much better in the car, he's a little angry at the ladies but don't take him too seriously he's only trying to make a buck. I'm sure if he keeps up like this he will make quite a few."
5,"Awesome, if you don't like it then go listen to classical","Rock on Kid!!!! it is so awesome if u don't like it don't get it . but for people that like limp bizkit or rap or hip hop, u will love it!!"
1,"I don't even give this cd one star, i think it sucked.","This CD was a dissapointment to me. I heard it on the radio, and thought it was good, so I got it for a good price. I listened to the song I liked, for about 5 minutes, then threw it in the trash...because thats what it is. white trash tryin' to rap... this isn't like vanilla ice white honkey rap, this is white honkey crap. I thought it would be like r.a.t.m., but frankly, it sucked, if you like country rap, get this cd, if you like r.a.t.m, or korn, or any other hard/metal/rap band, get their CDs, this one really isn't worth the money."
4,Great CD,I have been meaning to get this for a while as the copy from my early twenties went through a helluva beating. A great CD and in my opinion hid best work.
5,Classic Kid Rock!,This is the first kick butt album by Kid Rock! I've always wanted this album and needed to update my collection. Recently saw Kid Rock in concert and was so impressed with the performance. From laid back to totally rocking out! Get this album!
2,"KidRock is a promising artist, but his album isdissapointing","I view this album to be mediocre. There only songs I like are Batwidaba, I am the Bullgod, and devil without a cause. The other songs are very dissapointing because of the style. When I bought this album at the music store it was classified as heavy metal. I don't really view this album to be rap. This is a very typical example of the ""rock-rap"" genre. From the heavy metal point of view this is a very good album, but when viewed as rap it seems rather lacking. I do not recommend this album to fans of rap, but I strongly recommend it for fans of heavy metal. As for me, a fan of both rap and heavy metal, I am dissapointed as rap is my favore genre."
5,Does Kid Rock rock? OH HELL YEAH!,"This is by far the best CD I have bought this year(1999). The only song that doesn't live up to the expectations it has been given is ""Cowboy,"" and I can still stand to listen to it, so it's not THAT bad. In short, this CD ranks up there with those of the likes of Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Rage Against the Machine. If it isn't better that is."
5,A devil without a couse but with a uniqe flare,This Cd is one of the best CD's that I have bought in a long time. I love to listion to it while I am driving or partying. It is kind of a hip-hop CD with a rock and roll flare. I would recommend it to anyone that listions to Metallica to Master P.
2,This should be a single with Bawitdaba being the only song,"I bought this CD after I saw the Bawitdaba video. ""Bawitdaba"" is a real cool song, BUT let's not think that reflects on the rest of the CD. ""Cowboy"", is the stupidest, most annoying song on the CD and they made a video of that. The guitar here is great with that heavy heavy heavy metal sound that goes good with rap (I hate rap). Though I hate rap, I rather listen to this than some homie G whatever rap. At least the Kid's rap actually has some real music."
2,Good for a while... gets old fast,"I bought this album after hearing and seeing Bawitaba and Cowboy, because they were great songs at the time. You listen to this album for a while and it really starts to get older... and older... and older. For just about everyone, no matter how big a Kid Rock fan they are, I bet you'll wake up one day and look for a CD to play, and suddenly Devil just won't appeal to you whatsoever. Kid Rock's ""white trailer pimp trash"" image is humorous and fun for a while, but wears thin extremely quickly, I guess maybe because it all is just a show he puts on. His bragging about how much he drinks and smokes is enjoyable for a little while, but just gets old fast. Maybe if he quit relying on all the rap so much (because he's not good at it), quit putting on a show, and put a little depth and feeling into his music and element (the guitar is great), he'd be worthy of contending with a REAL rock band, like Tool."
2,This is ok...if yer 15,"I give it 2 stars for ""Bawitdaba"" & ""I am the Bullgod"" & a couple of other catchy tunes...but I agree with a previous review, ""Cowboy"" is ANNOYING! If you want some real rock-rap, get Beastie Boys & Rage Against the Machine...they came first."
1,this is awful.,"this is the most horrible piece of music ever. if you want somebody who is actually rebellious listen to guttermouth. they kick ass. kid rock doesnt. end of story. if you own this album, i suggest euthanasia. rap rock is the worst ""genre"" of music ever."
1,"!WORST""rapper""EVER!","Kid Rock thinks he's a rapper because he thinks he raps like the true mc's out there,but he's got NO SKILLS and he's THE BIGGEST FAKER EVER!"
1,Kid Rock,"Let me start off by saying that who ever runs the lists for ""essential"" (and i use that term lightly around here) rap rock lists on Amazon is a total retard. Even listing this in the essential rap rock cds is just plain stupid. BUT LISTING IN NUMBER ONE??!! WHAT THE f***!? I mean really, over RATM? Are you guys crazy? Kid rock sucks bad and couldnt make good music if he tried. Come one and all MTV worshipping losers, you have found your calling.(Now heres the best part, where the pop punk loser clicks the ""not helpful"" button)"
2,"Also Known as ""The Cuss-Fest""","Kid Rock already had several records under his belt when he released ""Devil Without a Cause,"" his first big success. It features ""Bawitdaba,"" a rock radio favorite, and the HIDEOUSLY mainstream ballad, ""Only God Knows Why."" It also includes the kinky and silly ""Cowboy,"" for which this record is probably best known.The album is fine for those who like hardcore rap and rock. And you had better be able to tolerate a bit of profanity, because Kid Rock does plenty of it (only because he can, mind you). Most of the songs' beats and rhythms are repetitious and tiresome. He can be a little melodic, however, notably on the opening chorus of ""I Am the Bullgod.""When you slap it all together into one plastic disc, ""Devil Without a Cause"" is not much more than an hour or so of profanity, innuendo, and arrogance. This is fine, of course, for those who enjoy it, but for those who can't tolerate rap (especially white rap), it's not worth getting."
1,Disappointed,"Wow, after lsitening to this album is: how on earth did a guy like this (ie unoriginal hick-hopper) manage to sell so many albums? Luck can be a pretty crazy thing sometimes."
3,Devil without Down-loadable Tunes,"I only wanted one song, but since Kid Rock refuses to offer down-loadable tunes I was forced to buy the entire CD. The song Cowboy (the reason I purchased the CD) is a classic an the unofficial strip club anthem. I give two thumbs up for Cowboy and only one thumb up for the rest of the album."
2,"NOT SO ""ROCK""","ALTHOUGH HIS NAME IS KID ROCK HE SINGS MOSTLY RAP. THIS CD IS A FLOP. I THINK THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THIS CD IS ""ONLY GOD KNOWS WHY"". THIS SONG PROVES THAT THERE ARE PRICES TO FAME AND ITS NOT ALL WHAT ITS CRACKED UP TO BE. IF YOU REALLY LIKE KID ROCK I SAY GET THE CD. IF YOU LIKE 1 SONG BY KID ROCK I SAY DONT GET THIS CD."
3,Devil Without a Cause great....if you like rap.,"I bought Kid Rock's latest based on the songs I'd heard on the radio (Bawitdaba, Cowboy, I am a Bullgod, Only God Knows Why). That was kind of a mistake. He has some other good ones on there, but for the most part, it's just another rap/rock album, with lots of unnecessary language, and songs about partying, pot smoking, and drinking. Know I'm not saying there's anything wrong with any of these forms of ""entertainment"", but a song about them...ne, an entire cd about them is rather pointless, not to mention shallow. My recommendation is to tape the songs off the radio or buy the cd singles...but unless you like rap, don't invest in the whole thing."
4,"You'll need a cool name, Bob Ritchie","...and Kid Rock was born. I usually hold off until I see 3 noteworthy hits, and it didn't take long. This is a must have in the ""Feel Good"" catagory. Since its release, I've played requests off 'Devil without a Cause' every single night at the club. Parents may frown at the occasional profanity (edited avail) But Kid Rock succeeds in blurring the boundaries between rap and rock, making you wonder if you file it before Korn or after Jay-Z. Thumbs Up."
4,71 on a scale of 1 to 100,"The first four songs are all good, as well as the last three songs. The middle is a mix of good and bad songs. Best song on the CD is Devil Without a Cause, with the worst song being Only God Knows Why. 10 of the 14 songs on the CD are good. There's a hidden track of a remix on I am the Bullgod."
4,3.5 stars,"A very good cd. Much more original than Limp Bizkit. The only bad part about this cd is that Kid Rock has to say his name in almost every single song. Still though, a very good cd with a lot of original sounding songs. Every song has a different beat to it."
5,"Just read the review, then go buy the CD!","If you can see past the few cuss words, you'll see a picture of what some people are actually going through, of course, some are written for pure fun and that's cool too. I love this cd! All the songs are awesome in their own way. His talent is unmatched, I would't be able to play all those instruments! Hey, if he's feeling stressed with too many instruments to play, I'll glady play the trap set! I recommend this cd for anyone that likes to party and have fun, and with a stomach for cuss words!"
1,What happened to tha KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID ROCK????,"Now, all these new fools who are just getting to know Kid Rock won't understand. But I've been listening to Rock's stuff for YEARS, and I hate to admit it but he's completly SOLD OUT FOR THA MONEY!!!! Yes, he's always had guitars in his tracks, but DAMN, this is too far. From classic's like ""Y0 DA LIN In Valley"", ""Balls In Your Mouth"" even up to his album before ""Devil..."", ""EMSP"" his tracks were tight. EMSP was his best since ""Grit Sandwhiches For Breakfast"". I was really excited about this release, then sold the CD 2 days later. If you like the old Kid Rock, you won't like this. I hope he's enjoying the time on MTV, cause in the end selling out will catch up to him."
4,Not Too Great But Pretty Good,"This cd is actually pretty good. There are some great momentts but some horrible ones. Tracks 1,2,3, and 12 are good but the rest are either OK or they really suck. I would buy it if you like Kid Rock or if you think you might like it. It's an OK but if you want it go ahead and buy it. But watch out. It is rap and some metal."
5,"This CD is not for children, but it is a very cool CD.","I would recimend this CD to anyone,but it is not for KIDS. All in All I love this CD."
1,Pathetic,"It's disgusting that this kind of crap can rule the pop charts, alongside Limp Bizkit and Britney Spears. This is just one more piece of proof that the art form of music has been degenerated into mindless guitar-thrashing noise and swearing. I don't know if we really need to go all the way back to the Beatles, although the music of that time period just in general is amazing (The Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Who, The Doors). But at least spend some time in the early nineties, with bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stone Temple Pilots, etc. This crap that's being passed off as music today should be trashed. It's pathetic that people actually listen to this, but even more pathetic that the record execs don't even care about the quality of their products, just how much it sells. I don't really know that this music will have much effect on the state of the nation someday, that may be overreacting just a bit, but I will say that it's a sad state for music."
5,This is the absolute best CD i have ever heard in my lifetim,"Kid Rock once again has mixed many distinct types of music and put together a great album. From the meaningless songs like Welcome 2 the Party, to the sweet tunes of Only God Knows Why, to the acid rock of I Am the Bullgod, Kid Rock has mixed them all and created a style all his own. This is one of the best CDs ever and should be owned by everyone in the world."
5,EARLY MORNING STONED PIMP STRIKES AGAIN,"There is not one bad thing I can say about this cd. I bought it a few months ago and have not stoped listening to it yet. ""I am the Bullgod"" has been around for years, it was a great song then and sounds even better now, (original song is a bonus track at the end). As far as songs 1,2,3,4,& 6 go, play them loud and play them often. ""Only God Knows Why"" is a awsome, laid back country style tune and sounds great. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys loud listening music."
4,"I thought it would be more ""Rock"" like!","ok, i heard bawitdaba on the radio and i thought that it was the greatest! i bought the cd, liked it, but when i went to the other songs, it sounded hick like with cheesy guitar playing and stuff! in my opinion, there are only about 5 good songs, bawitdaba, bullgod, f!#$ off, fist of rage, and where u at rock. if u liked bawitdaba and that kind of hard rock, then maybe u shouldnt buy this cd because its not so hard rock! kid rock isnt all rock."
2,"it's a good debut album, but he could do better",he got talent but in this album he just do't show .this cd got some really great songs that are worth listining. he didn't rhyme like in his new cd's cocky or one before that history of rock
4,Surprising Intelligence underneath the trailer,"Anyone that can write lines like ""I want to start an escort service for all the right reasons"" and ""lock me up and snort away my key"" has a brain worth checking out. Dig it loud!"
1,devil without a clue,"kid rock's latest lackluster effort is sickening at best. this album is seriously lacking in original ideas and the compositions are weak and tired. detroits music scene is poorly represented by his antics and dealings with the devil, mtv."
2,Disappointing,"I hadn't heard of Kid Rock before being floored by ""Bawitdaba"". I thought it was Rage Against The Machine, it was so good. I rushed out to buy this disc and to my utter disappointment, the rest of the album has a fraction fo the energy and inspiration of the lead track. Boring, middle-of-the-road rap, sub-Anthrax guitars, a general lack of creativity and buyer's remorse are what I found after listening to it a couple times (to be fair). If only there was a CD single, I would've saved myself the trouble and about $8."
1,After this album you'll never here that stupid name again,What is wrong w/you people. This has to be one of the trendiest albums I have ever heard. Can you say garbage!!!!!!!! Oh GOD please forgive me. My Label made me do it.
2,I was disappointed with the overall quality of this CD.,"After buying this CD, I was eager to see what else was on it because I had only listened to Bawitaba. I was very disappointed. While I hoped for more of the rap-rock sounds I was accustomed to, Kid Rock did not provide them. In fairness to him, Devil Without A Cause is excellent, easily the best on this album. But if you want rap-rock, don't buy this CD."
4,Exceptional,This CD is excellent! There only problem was it seems like Kid Rock was trying for the Parental Advisory sticker a little to hard. I give it a 4 or a 8.5 out of 10.
1,(-1 stars actually),"Run away as fast as you can! Kid Rock is arguably the worst song writter ever! Don't waste your time even looking at the CD case. I...this CD...I mean...MY GOD! You can't put into words how BAD of an ""artist"" Kid Rock is. All I can say is bawitdaba you arse as far away from any of Kid Rock's music as you can!"
1,Joe C. is gone...but this CD still sucks,"Sorry that you had to leave this planet a little too early Joe C., but that doesn't excuse this album from sucking. If you think this is good, you are saying that bad nu-metal/rapcore is good. Let's all instead listen to Rage against the Machine, shall we?"
1,Another version of Vanilla Ice,"This has a lot in common with Ice Ice Baby. This nonsense, as well as the other rap-rock jokers (Korn, for example) has already been done by groups like the Beastie Boys, who still suck to this day. If you want real new rock, try Hair of the Dog, Buckcherry or Laidlaw."
5,Kid Rock (Devil With Out A Cause),"I love Kid Rock and I love this album. This album is great.My favorite song on the album is ""Devil With Out A Cause"". The first time that I ever listened to this album was when my cousin Stacy got a limo for her B-day party and her friends sister put in the CD and I loved it."
1,Sucks like a Hoover,"This album is horrible. Everything about it. The lyrics (or jumbled words as i like to say) the musc (or sound) and most of all, the fact that Kid Rock thinks he's some kind of a God. When will he realize he's just a scrawny, nasty, greasy-haired, hick? If only I could have given it 0 stars.."
2,"Come to think of it, pretty bad.","I actually liked this when it first came out. 12 years later, I have to wonder why. Kid Rock may be talented from what I've heard about his live shows. I was surprised to find out he could play an instrument. That leads me to believe he might be able to read music...another big surprise. I think there's many much more talented artists out there for sure. This is my personal opinion and I'm entitled to it. He's great if you're not that much into music and have a cheap stereo or an IPOD."
3,Kid Rock,few people are able to combine two genres together and actually sound good kid rock does it well. There is a considerable amount of problems with this disc though 1. too long 2.too many wack tracks 3.why would anybody have a kid come in too rap on their song. I otherwise enjoyed devil wothout a cause.
5,Kid Rockin' the set,"Devil Without A cause is a rockin' CD. The singer has talent, and the songs are very catchy. It may sound similar to Limp Bizkit to some people but Kid Rock has a style of its own. Of course, some people may complain that the group sound more like ""Black Rap coppycatters."" I might have to agree on that. Anyway, the CD is good, if you like rap, you'll like this."
2,I was dissapointed.,"I expected more out of ""Devil without a cause"". The only good songs on the Cd is the ones that have made it big. It has nothing to do with the obseinities on this album. I happen to be one of the most biggest Insane Clown Posse fans you'll ever meet. Throught this cd his extremly large ego as well as his low talent shows as clear as glass. Id like to see Joe C go solo for he is the only one with the real talent next to Kid Rock."
3,decent,He has a good beat to his music. I noticed it on a rock station approx. 2 months ago and bought the cd. (cowboy is better)
5,I love This Aulbum,"I love Kid Rock's Devil Without A Cause.I rated it 5 because I love it so much!I think that Kid's voice is beautiful, hard or soft. This is not trash.Just think of how much trouble that Kid went through just to please us.You wouldn't like it if you worked so hard then someone call it trash."
4,Great CD for a good lyricist,"This does Kid Rock justice for his first major CD label debut (he released two to three other CDs before joining Atlantic/Lava records), and it works. The minute I heard his music on MTV (and no, I am NOT a ""teeny-bopper"" that likes the ""in-thing""), I loved it. And then the rest of the CD, especially the ballad ""Only God Knows Why"", is very much perfect.The only thing that keeps it from a perfect 5? The needing to STILL censor some of his lyrics even though the Paraental Advisory logo is on the cover (listen to the last verse in ""Cowboy"" to hear what I mean). If they didn't feel the need to do that, it would be a perfet CD. BUt it's still worth the 15-20 bucks for it."
5,I *LOVE* THIS CD,"The Kid is a GENIUS. His songs may have some explicit lyrics, but ""naughtiness"" aside, these songs are great. It's not really the music, as much as it is the lyrical content, but something about Kid Rock and ""Devil Without a Cause"" is so intriguing, I definitely recommend buying this cd. However, if you're opposed to foul language and topics such as interracial relationships and white trash, you may want to skip over this, and keep your money for something ""nicer."" But personally, all my friends and I *love* the Kid. He's awesome! And Joe-C (RIP) is the BOMB! ;]"
2,This Album Leaves a Lot To Be Desired,"I have to say that I am very dissappointed. Kid Rock simply does not have his own style. Most every good music artist out there has his/her own style. Kid Rock simply takes other people's style and blends them all together to create what he calls ""his own"". The rock/rap combo from the Beastie Boys is a little old. Now with him adding his simple twist to their music, it's absolutely terrible."
3,i am glad there is an edited version.,"i am glad there is an edited version. this little bible belt girl could not take the guy straight from the trailer. i was shocked at some of the words used - but that's just me. lyrically and musically the kid rocks - but the language - could he be chris rock's brother. and yet number 11 - is the coolest, most honest and sweetest ballads around."
1,please,"This crap will not be remembered twenty years from now. They're are a few decent songs I like on this album, but not enough lasting talent to contribute anything to the music world. Music seems to have gone from utilizing talent into creative, original, and thought provoking expressions to utter and complete thrown together media hype garbage. Most will see their five minutes of fame and then disappear. My generation (the twenty-somethings) will leave our mark on the music world....but it will definitely NOT be Kid Rock. It will be the likes of TOOL, Korn, Wyclef Jean, 2Pac, Erykah Badu, Mary J Blige, etc. The ones who are putting their all into their music and trying to advance it as a whole through their creativity, not to make a buck from a high school."
1,SEVERELY OVERRATED,"Why does the Amercan public always fall for formulas? This CD is another in the line of angry white-guys *trying* to rap (atleast Korn has something to say, however offensive), and hiding behind some guitar riffs."
1,Kid Stoned,"Come on you people. This isn't a ""...successful mixture of hip hop and rock..."", Kid Rock doesn't play music. He's just like Godsmack - ""Let's go play a loud guitar with the same chord over and over again but play it really loud so people will be stupid enough to buy it""... If you even think about buying this album I suggest you get some Korn, Orgy or even dare I say it Hanson instead. If you want to listen to this album go into your garage, pretend you're cool and play some really loud notes on a guitar until you are deaf. This is just stupid."
2,A Cry for Help,"This album represents Kid Rock's struggles with low self-esteem and inner turmoil with his lack of love and attention as a child. He demonstrates a sad lack of emotional maturity and an underdeveloped sense of identity. ""Cowboy"" indicates his attempts at escapism from the bonds of poverty and abandonment that so clearly plagued his formative years. I feel sorry for Mr. Rock and those that relate with his down-trodden message. It is a vulgar message of misogyny and self-destruction. Notwithstanding the loneliness and helplessness that Mr. Rock demonstrates, the album at times rocks. Two stars."
2,At least he's trying...,"""Bawitdaba"" caught my attention because it's one of the few creative efforts I've heard in years that's neither syrupy nor angst-filled. It's a fun, funky/rockin' track. ""Cowboy"" is a real trip, the varying musical styles are a big part of what makes it work. ""Only God Knows Why"" there aren't more songs like this, some people do still feel things besides hate, I hope. The rest of this album isn't my cup of tea (well, Devil Without a Cause is kind of cool) but at least someone is trying to be creative out there. Best of luck, Kid."
5,KID ROCK IS HERE TO STAY FOR THE LONG RUN.,"This album is multi-platinum for a good reason, It's awesome, Kid Rock is so talented he can play every instrument in the band. Besides that the album isn't one of those one song wonders, every song is great in it's own way. Bawitdaba hits you like a bolt of lightning. Cowboy then comes on and gives you a little country funk. Then Devil Without A Cause featuring Joe C. rips into you. I am the Bullgod is next and it's no slouch. Kid Rock also features feel good party tunes like Welcome to the Party and Wastin' Time. The Kid gets deep on Only God Knows Why and Black Chic, White Guy. As if that's not enough then the Kid just blows up on my favorite track F#@k Off featuring Detroit homeboy Eminem. Most artists wish that the had this many hits in their career. This is just one album, and believe me the Kid's first 3 albums are just as good if not better. America get used to Kid Rock because he's too talented to go away anytime soon."
4,Good CD with strong words and stories,"Kid Rock Music is Kid Rock Music. When you buy the cd, you know you're going to get a hard cd with heavy lyrics. If that is what you're looking for, here is he cd you want. This cd has great songs with many different tempos going from hard rap/rock to soft rock. I reccomend this cd highly to any person who likes heavy music. But if you dislike this type of music, most definately stay away from it."
1,Trash,This is yet another example of how rock has been ruined. First of all RAP AND ROCK will never mix..... People have ruined rock music by mixing it with rap. Jimi hendrix would be pissed off at today's music.. Don't buy this CD unless you like meaningless lyrics.
4,Not bad. Not bad at all...,"A decent CD. I'm not that big of a rap fan. In fact, I pretty much hate rap. However, this album is close enough to rock that I like it. ""Wasting Time"" is my favorite song on this CD, but ""Bawitdaba,"" ""Cowboy,"" ""I Am the Bullgod,"" and ""Only God Knows Why"" are also pretty good. For all you WCW fans out there, I still think ""Cowboy"" sounds like Jeff Jarret's entrance music."
1,he should be on Springer,his lack of talent and trailor park metality make his work more fit for Jerry than for a musical challenge.he is talentless pure garbage the kind of stuff that is overly promoted today.what a true no-talent bum.
4,kid rock is the best!,I have never really got into hard rock-but this cd has changed my way of thinking! i could listen to this cd for hours and hours-expect my parents don't let me listen to it when they are in the house....
5,Kid Rocks cd is a perfect gift for those who like hard rock,This cd contains bawitdaba and cowboy which are two of Americas favorite songs. They are songs on the popular mtv show called TRL.
1,Trash!,These songs have lyrics that have completely no reason for existing.They make no sense and the music is annoying.Please enrich your life with something with some purpose and class.
1,Kid Rock-A disgrace to everything that's good about Rock,"Please don't buy this cd! Spend your money on something that this garbage has ripped off. Rap and Rock are 2 genres that should never be mixed as much of today's music(Limp Bizkit, Korn, etc) proves. Spend your hard-earned dollars on something that will last and not just on some new fad"
3,"A decent album, there are better cd's and there are worse!","It took me a couple of days to listen to anything besides ""I am the bullgod and Bawitdaba"" those are the only real metal tunes on the record, but there are few catchy ones. I don't find myself a country fan, but I love the country--style tune ""Cowboy"". But myn favorite is ""Devil without a cause"". On this track Kid Rock uses catchy ryhming words and a good tune in the background. Also look for 3'9 JOE C. I usually don't care but I think he Kid Rock uses a little too much language on this record."
5,One word - AWESOME!!!,"This CD rules!!! It's about time somebody made this kind of noise. It's got thumpin bass, blasting guitars, phat rhymes, and even one awesome mellow song. This album is the bomb - check it out!"
1,"You poor, deluded fools.","I think that Kid Rock is to the nineties what Led Zeppelin was to the seventies. This guy is a pioneer. I'll tell you what, everybody is still going to be listening to this c.d. ten years from now. It is a travesty that you can't win a Pulitzer for a c.d. Kid Rock has changed my way of thinking. No, seriously, I think that Lennon/Mccartney, Jagger/Richards, and other ""songwriters"" could learn a lot from Kid Rock's keen and deep insights. I would write a longer review but I must go listen to this again, right damn now. Holy Mary, this is good stuff."
1,"No ""Cause"" for Kid Rock","This CD has to be the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've ever heard. When Kid Rock makes attempts at being humorous (like on ""Cowboy"" or the title track) I always ask myself it that was supposed to be funny, but when he goes for maudlin sentimentality like on the updated '80s power ballad tripe of ""Only God Knows Why"", I burst out laughing. The lyrics are incessant whining and sound contrived - it is Kid Rock's cry for sympathy though he doesn't need it, nor does he deserve it. Many of the songs on this album sound like a ill-conceived cross between Vanilla Ice and Poison, with the only remotely good song being ""I Am The Bullgod"", which rocks harder and has some engaging lyrics. The only reason why it's popular is because everyone is buying it since Carson Daly and MTV told them to. Without merits of its own, it's safe to assume that ""Devil Without A Cause"" would be languishing in obscurity if not for MTV's support."
1,"How about NO, Kid Rock","What kind of CD is this! Does he think hes cool? 0 songs good! ertarfi. Im making no sense like kid rock. Some role model he is. Ignore the 1 star, he deserves 0. GOOOOOOOOOO LIT."
2,The Twisted Brown Trucker Band is pretty good.,"The Twisted Brown Trucker Band is pretty good, that's the 1reason I gave this cd 2 stars. They need to ditch Kid Rock's sorry ass and go off on their own."
3,"Kid Rock, almost a decade in the game, may be to late.","Kid Rock was kicking the rap/rock madness that kids know and love in the Eighties. And while he has stuck to his guns (and beer bottles), the founder of hick-hop sweeps in at the right time with the killer single ""Bawitaba"" and should deliver the most raw, best of the best, down right nasty Lp setting him apart from the new breed and he sits apart on top as the king, right? Sadly, he just isn't that hard compared to the new breed. Infact his Twisted Brown Trucker Band playing against old eighties rap loops just seems... weak. Kid Rock may be the hardest, but his music needs a little more kick. He's knows the game and should sell a lot of records. More power to him, and his persona is welcomed. But look more for dance tunes than mosh anthems."
1,"""Bullgod"" rules; the rest does not.","On Harddrive not too long ago (with the always talented Lou Brutus) there was an interview with Kid Rock and he explained that he did not believe in ""Hit Singles"", but that an artist should only release a full length album. I don't see too much logic in that statement when there's only a single song in the label that has the slightest bit of demeanor! This is cheaply done, pseudo-rock rap which probably took overnight to complete. The ""explicit lyrics"" are merely done for shock value, and if you know all ""7 dirty words"" you know what to expect of the album. That said, if you're not a Huxley-bred slave of the MTV generation, you'll think the same as me when I say this is a trashy, annoying, worthless waste of time. 1 star, just for ""I am the Bullgod""."
1,buy this CD and be cool like the everyone else,"I first bought this CD because everyone at my school was talking about how great it was, but then I decided against being assimilated into the MTV generation and tried to regain some individuality (I know some of you who bought this CD don't understand this word so ask your parents what it means). Well this recording is a horrific excuse for music. The singing, drums, bass, and guitar are unparalled in their atrocity. Do not buy this CD be yourself and listen to bands with real ability or a message no this senseless b.s."
1,"Oh Geez, I thought this was gonna be good","I bought this cd hoping it would have some good sounds on it and war terribly disappointed when i heard such horrible music. It put me in such anticipation listening to the beginning of each song, hoping it would be a winner. It let me down every time. Blah Kid Rock, you are new stuff i'll give you that, but you lack skills"
1,This album stinks,"ya ya Kid Rock in the house! I don't understand why anyone would waste their money on this CD. Kids need to hear a good message, like POD, not some guy that only uses profanity to get his message across."
4,Belkin Replacement Battery,This is the second battery I have ordered for my Belkin UPS. They seem to last about a year with moderate use. I like the idea of being able to replace batteries and send the used battery back to the factory at Belkin's expense. I just wish the battery life were longer.
3,Punk?,"I must say i genuinley enjoyed this collection of classic nuggets of forgotten musical history. However I also must state for the record I think that coining this set as ""punk"" was a bit off. Some of this music just didnt fit under the title of punk. I mean this does have its moments, but at times it doesnt flow too well. The track listing seems sporadic and not thought out. They chose some weak material to represent some bands. For example i do not think ""pet Sematary"" was a good representation of most of the ramones work. To me this collection often falls more under new wave then under punk. I suggest passing on this collection unless you can get it for under 30 bucks."
1,dissatisfied,puchased this c.d.burner a few weeks ago. it does every thing well except will not copy data c.d. to c.d. per prompts on software have not been happy with ricoh tech support as i have tried every thing they suggested and after countless hours am sending back for full refund
4,Hardwood Shoto Bokken,"I bought this item for my son. Very durable. After he went to spar with one of his friends, the weapon looked just as good as if it were still new, but there was a little, tiny dent in the wood. Hardly noticable though. The handgaurd for the daito version (40 inches) is the same as the handgaurd for this shoto.Very good, but not perfect. 4-5 stars."
3,Good quality but looks poor,"I bought this show in black and it is really made of good quality leatherbut unfortunately in reality does not. It looks better off, than on."
4,Nice bath set,"I haven't really used the bathroom accessory set yet, but I was impressed with the quality of the products when they arrived. They are not cheap looking and are made thick and look like they will last, not like other light and thin metal items. I purchased them because they are stainless steel and hopefully rust-resistant. The toothbrush holder is easy to clean because you can take the top off and clean the inside as if it was another tumbler. And being stainless steel, they're easy to match with other items for the bathroom."
4,THE CHAMELEON THAT IS LONDON,"London is an amazing city, one of the worlds best, along with NYC and Paris. This book shows how this great city has changed through the 20th century and also how it has not changed. The images are amazing, London lends itself so prefectly to a book of this kind. Highly recommended to anyone with a love for London or a fascination with great arial photography."
4,Good laptop with some flaws,"Pros: looks great, very light (even with battery inserted), memory stick slot, convenient if you have a sony camera or mp3 playerCons: doesnt come with backup windows cds. It uses some vaio program that reinstalls original programs but is kinda annoying. Comes with Office 2003 but it is only a trial version, if you want to keep it after 60 days you have to buy the cd key. Touch screen is kinda glitchy, mouse connected to usb port doesnt repsond sometimes. Wifi connection isnt that strong.Overall, i would recommend this product. If you can get the software free then i guess the first few problems dont concern you. No ps2 port but i guess no one really uses that anymore anyway. I just wish that sony would give their customers a little more in terms of software for $2000."
5,Great lasagna pan,"I purchased this sheet cake pan planning to use it to make sheet cakes, unfortunately no recipes came with it so I don't know how many boxes of cake mix to use, nor cooking temps, etc. Figured it would come with at least one recipe that I could use as a ""starter"" recipe. Wound up using the cake pan for making deep dish pasta dishes, lasagna, etc. It's teflon coated so it's very easy to clean up, just use plastic utensils and it shouldn't scratch. It actually wipes clean with a paper towel. I did not use the dishwasher, since the temperature gets too hot for teflon, I just hand washed."
2,not reliable,I got it 7 Years ago. I used 3 months & sudenly it stop sound. I call onkyo & send it to Repair under de guaranty. I paid only for shipment. But 2 months ago I got The same problem again. If I send it to repair I had to pay shipping & at least $150.00 may be more I rather get a new one but not a Onkyo
5,Excente product.,"A very good form to avoid that somebody introduces its anxious hands in our computer or that pieces change to him or rob. Excellent for schools, universities or any place where a computer can be victim of a thief of components."
1,Contains Lead,"This is an adorable pole, and works well for little hands. However, there is a sticker on the back that says it contains lead. I would not have ordered this product if I had known!"
3,so far so good,"This made it through 1 fishing trip so far with a 5 year old. More than I can say for the dora telescoping childs rod reel combo that only lasted 3 hours. The bad thing with these rod reel combos is when you break the rod or reel you throw the whole thing away because it is made as one piece, nothing is replaceable. I will give update after a ew more fishing trips."
1,Vendor sent to wrong address,"I am very upsetI had ordered this item (fishing pole)to be sent to my grand daughter for a upcoming camping tripIt came in correct amount of time but to wrong addressShe lives out of town, and expecting it to arrive at her house before tripThe vendor whom sent it , sent it to my home out of townI put the correct address to be sent but they did not follow instructionsShakespeare Princess Spincast Combo KitThe seller I give a one star for this is very much a disappointment to our grand daughters camping trip"
4,All rounder - romance + thriller + mystery !,"This is my 3rd Christina Skye novel. I was introduced to Draycott Abbey and its ghost, Adrian Draycott with Gideon. Draycott Abbey had 'acquired' a new fan for life!Key to Forever is hard to put down once you've started. From medieval armour and ancient swords to Gypsies and even palm reading, it was an exciting adventure !! One of those rare books which make you feel good during and after the read. I really enjoyed the book and its 2 main characters - Alexei and Joanna - the chemistry between them was explosive. The flashbacks in time were well written. All said, I think that it's a good read and really worth buying.Thanks."
2,HEADACHE MATERIAL---,"I spent most of this book thinking ""Huh?"" It was like someone took a story and randomly pulled out bits and pieces from here and there and then called those random pieces a book. It gave me a headache trying to follow the clutter and I never felt any connection with the book or its characters. It also didn't help that it took almost 300 pages for the supposed hero and heroine to get their acts together. By then, I just wanted this dreadful story to end."
5,True Christmas Spirit,"If you want to hear some beautiful Chrismas music with a Celtic flair and you cannot see the corresponding concert live, then this album is for you. ""What Child Is This"" will bring tears to your eyes, it's so beautiful."
1,Not as pictured!,I bought two of these in different sizes so my boys would match for Halloween. This costume is NOT as pictured!!!!!!
3,Bulky,"A lovely design, this ends up being a very bulky ring. It comes up a full centimeter from my finger. Despite this, it is comfortable. The silver has a hard finish which ends up looking a lot like stainless steel."
1,A poorly written book on an important topic,"The ability to manage organizational change is a crucial element of being a good manager. Unfortunately, Abrahamson's book does not do an effective job of teaching the lessons needed to learn change management skills. In his book, Abrahamson makes it apparent that he is a career academic with no real experience as a business leader. His examples are trite and unhelpful, and the lessons he tries to teach are either painfully obvious or too theoretical to ever be of any real help in a business setting. For a good book on this topic with solid advice and relevant examples, try either ""Change Management"" or ""Strategic Organizational Change."""
2,A book for confirmed enthusiasts,"Describes a selection of message-passing approaches, including the techniques of MSBNs and LJFs initiated by Xiang and his colleagues in earlier publications.Concepts are introduced laboriously and the page count could be halved with negligible loss of clarity. Separately, the style of prose demands more patience than that of, say, Russell and Norvig ('AI: A Modern Approach'). Yet I imagine that sections of the book could function as a reference, for advanced readers who knew what to look for."
1,Lenses are flawed,"I bought the blue shaded version of the Eastbay polarized sunglasses and received a pair with horizontal distortion lines in the lenses. If you wear these often, I am sure it will kill your vision after a while. It is a pitty, because they fit snug, look nice and give good protection, but totally useless as focusing through those lenses is impossible. I have contacted Eastbay about it but they seem to busy to reply, after all, I only lost 7 us$, right?"
4,TRENDnet TEG-PCITXR,"Needed a low profile gigabit card for desktop PC. The computer was given to my company by UPS with a thermal label printer. (no one actually buys desktop PC's anymore... towers at the very least). Since we've set it up to run on a LAN with multiple workstations I wanted to speed up the connection to our network. The onboard NIC was only 100Mb/s so I looked for a cheap gigabit NIC to get the job done. This does accomplish that and installing it on windows xp pro was not a problem.here's how it actually shows up as the device:TRENDnet, TEG-PCITXR 32-bit 10/100/1000Mbps PCI ADAPTERevery trendnet product I've used has been great so I can't complain."
5,Classic short stories from Barker,Classic short Stories from Barker that were written and published in the mid 1980's and still remain essential reading for fans of dark fantasy and horror fiction. A must have for your collection!
2,Love Kid Rock...,But not this cd! I have become a huge fan of his music...my favorites are Rock and Roll Jesus and Born Free...but not this one.
2,Readable 'classic' but not very captivating.,"This book is meant to be a classic, but I didn't find it very enthralling. Granted I read the book, but I expected more about the life of the child, Eppie, to have been brought into focus, and also more so her effect on the life of Silas Marner. Basically, this book is readable but mainly drones on."
4,Passionate writing about one of society's greatest denials.,Mary Gjetson Levin has done an outstanding job of portraying the alchoholic relationship and household. At times I found this book difficult to read as it echoed my own family's struggles with an alchoholic father and husband. Levin's bold writing brings a sense of love and humanity to an otherwise lost relationship. Her delicate balance of writing and honesty presents a MUST READ for anyone in an alchoholic relationship. This is a good book to give to those in need. I could not put this book down!
1,Dear John: Love Letters and Lessons Learned from the Wife of an Alcoholic,This book is really about love letters. It's confusing and doesn't seem to really help you understand how the wife coped with her husbands addiction.
5,Best Bible I've Ever Used,"This is my primary Bible. It's perfect for any protestant reader, and includes a brief summary of Luther's thoughts on every book. Great study notes, also. Usually, a large passage will leave you wanting just a little bit more of the footnotes, which I love, because then I do my on research. Just be careful not to get ""addicted"" to these very well put-together notes. Remember, they are usually commentaries and inferences by men and women, not the divine Word of God.I've had this Bible for about 4 years now, and my mother has had her copy for probably 8. Both are in excellent condition, even with heavy use. One more thing: I reccomend making any notes with a ballpoint pen, not a gel-type pen. It usually takes a while for gel ink to dry on these pages, as they aren't very absorbent. You don't want any nasty smears in place of your inspired notes! Good luck finding a Bible, even if this is not the one for you."
5,The Best Bible I've Ever Used!,"My first Bible was Beck's American Translation, which I adore. However, the cross references, concordance, and footnotes in this NIV self-study Bible makes it super useful! When I want to study a certain subject or write a Biblical paper or article, this is the first book I grab! Without this self-study Bible, I would be stumbling blindly through my old Bible. This is a real time-saver when you need to find that verse you know is in the Bible, but just can't remember where to find it.The pages are quite thin, so care must be taken when turning pages. I would not recommend this Bible for children, due to this fact. This would be a perfect confirmation gift, which is how I received my copy."
4,Concordia Self-Study Bible -,"It was required for me to buy it for class, but I feel like I could have picked up any other bible and I could still succeed in my class."
1,There is a new ...,"and much better Lutheran Study Bible now available. It is an ESV ""version"", which is much more reliable than NIV.For a true Lutheran experience in interpreting Scripture, get it instead (yes, I own one and LOVE it!)"
3,Good notes and translation,This is a vgood contemporary translation with many excellent notes. My probles is the Lutheran and someother Protestants overvaluing Paul over Jesus and their emphasis on such an incomprehensible idea Grace. The other idea that is amiss with Christian undestaning of the bible is that of Jesus death as necessary for the forgivness of sins. Please someone explain that ridiculous idea. Why would such a gruesome event be necessary or even true.
4,it is a very good bible,It is a very good bible but I should prefer it was made to new study bible totally annoted by lutherans. more dogmatic
5,"Great Read, Detailed Concordance",This Bible is great for the reader who wants to dig into the Word. The notes on the bottom of each page answer almost any question you might have about the text. The Concordance in the back of the Bible is very helpful to cross-reference and understand the many connections between the Old and New Testaments. I highly recommend this product.
5,Concordia NIV Self Study Bible,"This has to be the best Bible! Easy to use, great to be able to read Luther's comments on each book of the Bible - a must for conservative Lutherans."
2,Too General to be very useful,This book does what a fortune teller does by being very general. And too general to be of much use. This book doesn't contain examples using real chess positions. Just a lot of written words and no exact examples of how to use them. You are better off buying another chess book.
3,Looks better than it feels,"The leather steering wheel on my Toyota Avalon had dried out and the finish failed and I got this to cover it. The cover did take a while to sew on; but, that is going to be the same for any leather steering wheel cover. The final result looks great but the finish is so hard it doesn't really feel like leather to me."
3,Pretty good.,"I bought this to recover my steering wheel on my larger SUV. It fits the steering wheel preet good. Although I admit it took me about 4 hours to do. The instructions could have been a little clearer, but I fault myself for sewing the cover wrong the first time. I ran out of string half way through, I started using the 2nd thread when I relaized I shouldn't have doubled the thread as a sewed earlier. :( I will keep this on for awhile, since if I remove my wheel will be sticky, it isn't matchy matchy with my tan interior but maybe that's because my SUV is a few years older?"
2,Split seam,"Sewn seam was crooked and split when I started installing it. Check it carefully to make sure the seam is centered before putting it on.Edit: The replacement is COMPLETELY different than the defective original. Most visibly, the stitching is hidden. It's not nearly as tight (though the box says the same size), and half-way through installation was gapping away from the wheel. I wrestled it back somewhat, but then the skip stitching around the spokes gapped. I'm going to cut it off, re-sew one of the seams (make it smaller) and try again. It must be SUPER tight when starting to prevent the end-fold/gapping other people complained about. Temporarily securing it several places around with tiny zip-ties helps too. The thread isn't waxed cord, but common multi-fil polyester, like flat yarn. If you snag it with a needle, it frays."
2,Not worth it.,The leather was thin and worn out at one end.The laces provided are very basic and look ugly.Lacing the thing up requires some amount of skill and effort.Overall I'd suggest you visit a local target/walmart and pick up an off the shelf products instead. I ended up buying a new one within 3 weeks from a local departmental store. Not Leather but it was comfy and better looking all for the price of 15 dollars. It was that ugly!
2,Too Small,"I bought this for an older model Graco pack n' play we got from friends who no longer needed it. The mattress measures 27"" x 39"" and before washing it my husband and I tried it out to see if it fit. It's too small. I know it's supposed to be snug but the mattress won't even lay flat with this sheet on it. It seems like it'd be a great product, if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly."
5,"Good fit, sturdy, soft, easy to clean","We have one in light blue and one in cream, and we love them both. These quilted sheets fit the pad well, and work well with the bassinet in place or without. They wash easily and retain their shape without shrinking. I like the extra cushion they give my baby in the Pack and Play without their being so thick they are unsafe. They look nice, too."
4,Good Buy,We bought this sheet to add some cushion to the pack-n-play mattress our baby often slept in. We have owned it through two babies and it has held up well and makes the bed a little softer to sleep in.
1,Too Abrasive,I used the quilted sheet for the first time when my baby was 6 months old. He woke up the next morning with his face raw and irritated. The thread from the quilting is just too abrasive on his delicate skin. I won't ever use it again.
1,Sheet would not fit,"This looks like a great idea, but there is no way to get it to fit, it's way to small. I have a standard graco pack and play. The regular pack and play sheets fits fine."
4,Much better than normal sheets!,"I like this sheet so much better than the thin ones. It offers more padding and seems so much more comfy! It is a tight fit, but I had no problem fitting the sheet onto my Eddie Bauer pack n play. So, I would assume it should fit any pack n play. Just make sure to wash in cold water, and hang dry. I never put this in the dryer. The only thing I don't like is the color. It happens to match my navy blue playard, but I wish it came in some lighter colors."
3,Good product,"Bought this product because I live in an RV full time. Most of the time I has satallite, but in some parks because of trees, etc it is not possible to use. I had a full size antenna all summer. When I replaced that, with this product, it seemed to work just as well and will be a lot easier to transport. did not try it with DTV box, so can't comment on that."
4,great product,"the sharp dta antenna really does find the digital channels,and brings them in crystal ''clear''."
4,Great Buy,"Works great for TV signal in 40 mile radus. I recieve signals from three different directs. (North, South, Northwest). Great value!"
5,unbelieveable guitar,"This artist is unbelievable. Her guitar playing is close to Khaki King. It is among the best artistry in the US in playing guitar. If you like true handwork, true passion, true talent, please take a listen to this."
2,Historical review about color pigments,"If you have a deep interest in color and how pigments and materials have been developed or discovered this is a book to read. There are only a few illustrations and lots of text, it is not a light book to read cover to cover. It is not a handbook and not a book of facts, its more like a history book.I value the effort put in the book, but it wasn't exactly what I expected and I won't read it twice."
2,Take a miss on these earbuds,"I wanted some earbuds for my Zen player which fit in my ears and wouldn't fall out. These earbuds did fit my ears. However, a month after starting to use them one channel went out and now I have sound coming out of only one earbud. Also, I have no idea why these are called, ""high quality"" earbuds, unless it was a sales tactic. The sound quality is not as good as the sound of the original Zen earbuds. I am back to using the original buds, but I'm $20 lighter in the pocketbook. I was dissatisfied with this purchase."
2,Poor sound quality,"Maybe it was my high expectation, but the sound quality was no where I would describe as hi-fidelity - non existent mid-range and very artificial bass. You may want to experiment with all the three sets of ear buds. The sound effect does change quite a bit depending on how the ear buds are positioned inside your ear canal.I much prefer my old Sony MDR-Q22SL."
2,hype,Bought new ear piece for new ipod. Had Koss plugs. Panasonics are awful. Tried all the sizes. Guess I don't have the right ears for these.Koss plugs are great. Reverted back to them and have no desire to upgrade after hearing Panasonics. Are the Sony look alikes any better???
5,Holidays - A great holiday CD,"This CD is a wonderful holiday recording! Not your usual holiday music, Mosci's beautiful voice and excellent, sometimes offbeat arrangements breathe new life into old holiday standards. There are 2 fine new Mosci songs, including a Chanukah tune, and an emotional rendition of Joni Mitchell's River.Highly recommended to anyone looking for traditional holiday songs reinterpreted in a new, fun and uplifting way."
2,Very uneven,"Following a rather politically charged introduction (the Lewinsky scandal is mentioned in the first sentence), the book has eight chapters, with two each apportioned to George Washington, William Wilberforce, Abraham Lincoln, and Alexandr Solzhenitsyn. The inclusion of Washington is baffling: if did anything that required character, it is certainly not described in his chapters, which include a short biography and a summary of his views on religious liberty. The chapters on Wilberforce and Lincoln are good. Those on Solzhenitsyn are so brief (and heavily edited) as to be unmoving."
4,A fun introduction to the series.,"It's been a few years since I've read one of Jane Langton's Homer and Mary Kelly books, but this was a welcome return to the series. Langton's style tends toward the humorously melodramatic, which fits this particular plotline well. While the conclusion was no huge surprise, getting there was the most fun. (I especially liked her ""bad seed"" child character, Charlene.)"
5,A great band and a great book!,"Alice in Chains proved to be one of the most influencial bands of the Grunge era of music, and this book helps show you why! A spectacular array of well written and tight songs are displayed in a format that is easy to read and understand. Anyone looking to play something new should give this book a try. It's highly recommended for all levels of playing experience. Even if you're a beginner, you'll be playing ""Rooster"" in no time!"
5,Usual great work from Petteway,"For those who don't know, Al Petteway plays guitar. It's sort of loose-form new age melodic guitar which may not be for everyone but I find it calming. He arranges beautifully, plays beautifully and sticks to actual melodies instead of the rambling formlessness a lot of new age players favor (which I do not care for). The lack of vocals makes his work perfect for when you're working on the computer or trying to do something that requires concentration but begs for some background tunes. Gentle, interesting, uninvasive and masterfully performed."
4,An ambitious book.,"I think the previous reviewer has belittled Wilber's scope by making out that this book is primarily about Buddhism. This book is nothing of the sort, and Wilber consciously widens the scope of any specific 'world religion' and he portrays a spiritual perspective of God which seems to me to be smack-bang in the middle of Eastern and Western philosophies. Many people would say that Buddhism and Western theism are oceans apart, but Wilber reveals here that there may only be One ocean. Some people might think Wilber is a little too pretentious or too bold with his thinking, but I feel he carries it off as well as anyone could. This book is not for everyone, but it's well worth delving into."
5,Great,This is one of the most incredible books you will ever read.It is the book that Wilber first presents his four quadrants and continues with his hierarchal model. It will take time to read it but so what.
1,Tome,"The reader must first realize this is NOT a book about Sex, Ecology or Spirituality. It is a philisophical rant and what Wilber considers present day modernity and post-modernity. He makes his arguments by making up words to discribe his arguments (words you will never find in an English language dictionary). Secondly, it is DEFINITELY NOT a book about evolution, unless you define evolution as the way Wilber takes you from one argument to the next, but then you must also remember that he only does this through invented words to fit his argument. It is an ""interesting"" read though and when you are through it will make a great paper weight. It is not an easy read for someone without education in a variety of subject areas."
1,DID NOT FIT THE GUN!,"Received promptly. However the holster did not fit the gun it is made for. I called Bianchi and spoke with customer service who told me to spray silicone in the inside of the leather. Did that, no better fit.The problem is the retention strap is just 3/8"" too short. I pulled the strap, putting the end in a vice, and stil no good.Holster was sent back to Bianchi for ""Refitting"". I had to wait another 10 days for it to be returned in the mail. Upon receipt the packing list merely said ""Refitted"" and that was all. When I sent it to Bianchi, I placed a lenghty letter inside the holster stating that the retaining strap was too short. Apparently they did not bother to read it.Anyway, I spoke with Amazon who gave me a return label, and I purchased a very similar holster from Galco Leather . . .Long and Short, after a 1-day break-in, I have a holster which fits my Glock."
5,THANKS KELLI...,"i must confess, i haven't bought her 1st solo album because most of the reviews described it mainly as pop, which i'm not very fond of... but at the same time, most of the reviews for this one described it as being much much better and i totally agree!definitely worth the price for being an import! for all of us who really miss kelli's voice, after almost 10 years we can finally haver her back, with brilliant catchy tunes... my favorite: home honey i'm high (#4)"
3,Psychic Cat Box,"After enjoying Kelli with the Sneaker Pimps and Loving ""Tigermouth"", I was very disappointed with ""Psychic Cat"" It has none of the great hooks that made ""Tigermouth"" so engaging. The lyrics feel much less inspired and aren't nearly as witty as her previous CD. If you haven't bought either CD, Buy ""Tigermouth"" first. ""Psychic Cat"" is a mediocre offering."
2,Meh.,"Meh. If you are looking for ""Six Underground"" do not look here. While I do consider her remarkable, this was not for me at all."
1,Nonsense,"This is a perfect example of why Kelli Dayton was booted from Sneaker Pimps. She can't be taken seriously. This isnt Britney Spears but it's not very far off. It's music for folks that have moved on from Britneypop but still need to cling to that kiddie rock sound. Just because it has an ""edgey"" techno sound doesn't make it good.Kelli seems confused about what direction she wants to go. The only interesting songs are the ones that are mostly instrumental. Kelli's voice was tolerable on Becoming X because the songs were great.After her departure Sneaker Pimps were then able to make some serious music without the limitations of her vocals. If you think that Becoming X is the only good Sneaker Pimps album then you might possibly like this. Unfortunately she's missing an important ingredient: good songs."
5,America in Primetime: Twin Peaks,"PBS's documentary series ""America in Primetime"" features original interviews with some of the best minds that TV and film have to offer, painting a picture of the evolution of American television across the last 60 years: David Lynch (Twin Peaks, Mulholland Dr.), Matthew Weiner (Mad Men), Vince Gilligan (Breaking Bad), David Chase (The Sopranos), Diablo Cody (Juno, The United States of Tara), James Manos Jr. (The Sopranos, Dexter), Alan Ball (Six Feet Under, True Blood), and many other notable creators of television.""America in Primetime"" is entertaining and educational, and an insightful look into the medium of narrative television. If you want an idea of what this documentary series is like, then check out this article featuring a segment from ""America in Primetime"" discussing the impact of David Lynch's influential 90's TV Series ""Twin Peaks"":http://entertainmentguidefilmtv.blogspot.com/2012/01/america-in-primetime-twin-peaks.html"
5,Unmissable,"If you don't see this you will miss out on a wonderful experience. The documentary tracks TV from the post WWII era to the present day and if you were watching over the decades you will not only appreciate the well edited clips from various shows you have watched and loved but also the comments from directors, actors and writers are entertaining and informative. I saw it on TV but was so impressed I am going to buy the DVD so I can watch it again. Enjoy."
4,A Good Book With a Moral,"I think this book was pretty good. It's message is that you should be proud of what you can do, and don't expect to have to be the best all the time. I really liked this book cuz Abby learned a really good lesson."
4,This was not THAT bad of a book!,"The reader before me was kind of rude by telling her review. Whenever you get in competition, and someone is beating you, you practically always feel you aren't good enough! That's just the way it is. Abby was being normal in the book. And BSC FANS AREN'T SHALLOW. But the ones who put them down are."
3,Could be better,"I purchased this printer 8 months ago(used on a Mac) and am now wishing I'd decided on the Epson1280 instead. The printer has given me problems from the start when I try to print on custom sized paper sizes. Tech support was unable to find a solution either. Another issue is the inaccurate colors. Even with much tweaking most colors end up too green, also the colors lack brightness and vividness. And forget about the rear feed. I only got it to cooperate once. What it does is grab the paper and feed it through the printer without printing on it. I've seen some amazing stuff which was printed on the Epson printer and that is what I'll be replacing this one with."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This Printer is terrible! Don't buy this one. It is constantly jamming or refusing to feed paper. It also prints crocked on the page when it does print. I won't even donate this thing to anyone, it's going into the landfill where it belongs!"
1,bad printer,"I really dislike this printer. It's slow, it's bugy-both the software and the hardware and the print quality is not that good. I wish that I could get rid of it but I would feel guilty selling to someone."
5,I Love This Printer,"This is the best everyday printer on the market. I have bought three of them in the past. I really hope they do not take this printer out of productions. It's reliable, efficient and QUIET... Love it HP!"
1,Go to Epson,"The CP1700 just absolutely died on me and simply wouldn't run anymore. This is the third HP printer I have had and the third time the same thing has happened.Paper feeding problems galore and no response from HP when I inquired. The quality of HP printers has declined drastically. Anyone who tells you anything different is a con artist. I run a printing/publishing business, so I do know what I am talking about. For a small desktop, wide format printer, I have gone to the Epson 1280. What a beautiful printer. Even the cost of cartidges is much better than HP's. No wonder HP is in trouble!"
1,"Agree, it dies in less than a year","I have the same experience as the people above, it runs for some months, begins to squeak and then dies. The carrage seems to be jammed and I can't even get it to turn off. I used to be a loyal HP customer now I will avoid them whenever possible."
1,Does this thing come with a hamster inside?,"We use this printer at my work, and those of us who have a desk in the same room as the printer hate it! This printer has been squeaking so loudly that we joke and tell customers that we have a hamster running on a wheel inside of it. The customers can hear the printer squeaking in the background when they call in. The squeaking is so loud that it is hard to hear on the phone when it is running. The print quality is not very impressive, either. I have one at home by HP that cost a 10th of what this piece of junk did, and the quality on my printer is much better.No one seems to have any solutions for getting rid of the unbearable squeaking, other than to throw the whole thing into the garbage dumpster."
1,Poor choice,"My main beef with this printer is the ridicuously large margins it requires you to have. You can't print 1/2"" from the bottom of the page, which rules out most page numbers, footnotes, etc. Epson printers, even their older lines, are much better at this. I would not recommend this printer."
2,Wow,Works great for 1 year then it started locking up. I think it is something electronic because both the lights blink like crazy then it starts spiting out paper with some symbols on it. have to unplug it to stop it. Let me know if you want one I will send you mine.
1,Great when it can actually feed paper,"This sucker has more trouble feeding paper than any printer or copier I have ever seen. I have the lower paper tray, and I have only once ever managed to get the d**n printer to actually feed from it. The top tray actually actually can works (sometimes). The bizarre thing is that once it reads the first sheet from a stack, it is solid! But getting that first sheet to feed is a nightmare. Take the tray out, flip the stack, blow air in, make the stack bigger, smaller, bang on the printer, repeat 10-20 times, and then the first sheet will feed and the whole stack will be fine. Absolutely insane. I'll never get another HP printer after this."
4,Great arrangements,"I hadn't been at the piano for almost 20 years, bought one, bought this book and a few others. It was a little challenging getting back into it with the keys on a few songs but well worth it. My favorites ""Home"" and ""You don't know me"" are wonderfully arranged. I love the more jazzy take on the old favorite [""You don't know me""]."
5,michael buble-its time vocal/piano,Loved the songs in this vocal collection. I was glad to see that although had a vocal line with the music the songs were in piano solo format. They were beautiful on piano and easy to play.
5,Just Because it's GREAT!,"I am SO glad I purchased this CD. I love it from start to finish. I was looking for someone with a nice voice, good music, and a different sound than what's on the radio. Conya is excellent! I'm looking forward to checking out her other CDs.While I do wish the CD was longer, I won't complain because I can listen to each and every song - there are no filler tracks here. A solid album. You can put it in and let it play...Fave tracks:Just BecauseStay (LOVE IT!!!)Sweet LoveMissin YouAint Givin UpYou know what? They're all good...I'd end up listing the entire album...Enjoy!(BTW, thanks to all reviewers before me...your feedback was very much appreciated.)"
4,Great! 41/2 Stars!!!!,"I love how Ms. Doss has done it again. I have both versions European and U.S. The U.S. is more commercial, the European has a more raw sound to it, more live. Overall, She just keeps getting better and better! I would have liked to hear a few more cuts like Coffee! But ""Sweet Love"" is the joint!! It's all good!"
3,Glad Conya Is Back!!!,"I listened to this CD on a long drive in my rental car. I was so excited to get it because I loved her first CD so much, but I'm a bit disappointed. The songs, while well written, excude a sameness-Same chord, same key, same sound-all sung the same way. Same music, same drum beat, same bridge. It sounds like one really long song. I expected more from this CD. It's not a bad CD by any means, just not what I thought it would be. I'm glad to see Conya back and I hope to see her live soon!"
4,Damn Damn Good,"I had her first cd and was so happy to see that she wasn't going to be another one hit wonder. This cd is just as good as the first. She's a slept on artist but I hope she starts to get the recognition she deserves. She has a beautiful style, sweet voice and her beats are nice. The only problem I have with the cd is that some of the recordings sound defective - like they're dirty or have cracks or pops in them, but nothing major that ruins any of the songs. And like another reviewer stated, pick this up before it's gone (and you end up paying $40 for a used copy)!"
4,Lov'n it,It's such a relief that Ms. Doss has done it again. I wish she would have had a few more cuts. Definitely a Great sophmore effort! Keep it up!
4,A Breath of fresh Soul Music,"This woman should be known by more people. A different twist on soul music. ""Here We Go Again"" and it is alright with me."
5,Excellent Movie About Family Drama,"Paved With Good IntentionsThis movie reminds me of real life family drama. I really enjoyed this drama between two brothers, the father, a sister and decesed mother.This is a good movie and a teaching tool to teach folks about keeping family secrets and lies.I am going to encourge everyone to watch this. Maybe this movie can prevent others from making the same mistakes.Thanks Amazon"
5,A Must Read,"Having grown up in they same area as holding Hodding Carter, I think he did a fantastic job of describing discrimination in Louisiana many years ago. I read in the local paper that the beautiful carter home may be made into a museum."
3,A pleasant read,"I gave this book three stars, which in my mind usually means that the writer achieved her objective, but not much more. However, it wasn't at all clear to me what her objective was, so I can't tell if she achieved it. It's a nice enough read, anyway.The book is a series of vignettes about gardens in ""cottage country"" in Northern Ontario, Canada. The gardeners, in residence only for the summer months, battle against vast outcroppings of rock, frequent dessicating winds and nightly visits from hungry wildlife. It made me believe that I garden in the lap of luxury with only a few winter gales and the occasional mole. But then I don't have the resources to bring in barge loads of topsoil, as these gardeners seem to do, so I guess it all evens out.This is a pleasant read for a cold wet evening. The book has a short bibliography, a short resource list and plenty of colour illustrations."
2,overrated,"if your buying this book for clinical information on treating a disease or ailment, don't. i am an pharmacist and study quit a few resources on alternative medicines. this only gives you the basic information on what herbs may treat a disease. it also gives you a multitude of herbs possible for each disease entity. good luck guessing which one of the several choices you should use. this book is more useful for the green weenies environemental justifications."
4,A lot of information to absorb,"Dr. Taylor cured herself of cancer after traditional medicine had written her off.She goes over a lot of information about Amazon herbs, how and when to use them. Take your time and study the book. It is information dense.Because of this book I purchased the herb Cat's Claw when I got sick. I do think it helped me clear the illness. It is almost tasteless and taken with a small amount of water it is easy to use.It can be hard with so many overlapping symptoms to pick the right herb so move slowly and carefully before deciding what course you want to pursue."

Use them.Man gave us pills, avoid them.Pills kill and herbs cure.Make your choice.Pills made my life hard and I almostsubmitted to a useless operation.Desperately, I looked for another choice.Herbs gave me the answer.No operation needed, life is good again!!!"
5,Fabulous health source,"Although I'm not a ""greenie,"" I have been concerned for some time about the wanton destruction of the jungle in South America since so much of our medicinal herbage does grow there. My major concern here is that the soil is not even fertile enough to continue growing grass for cattle after the first year or two, so this destruction is not even truly beneficial for mankind in any way. Ms. Taylor lays down a terrific case for persuading Brazil to stop doing this. Then she gives amazingly organized guidelines for using the herbs which she has found helpful in the Amazon area. Every herbalist needs this book!!"
1,Good camera when it was working,"Camera was great for a couple of days; good pictures outdoors, super fast shot-to-shot time, some problems in low light conditions. Easy menus and ergonomics, but beware, some wrong information in the manual.The fatal problem was that the SD cards kept corrupting after using the camera for any length of time. No matter the brand, speed, or capacity of the card, it happened consistantly and without notice. Turning off the camera to let it ""cool"" was the only way to get it working again (reset didn't work).Interestingly, the picture on the LCD always looked great after the shot, but when you reviewed them later, surprise, the pics would be corrupted.Kyocera support was marginal, got back to me with form emails really. Never did get to talk to a live person. Camera went back, and it would be tough to convince me to buy a Kyocera product again; definatly not in the same league as the big boys (canon, nikon, sony, etc)"
4,Allied Health: Practice Issues and Trends in the New Millenium,"Book was advertised as like new condition. It had some highlighting, writing, and bent corners. Overall a good purchase. The highlighting was not that bad and most of the writing was identification of the previous owner. The book serves the purpose that it was purchased for adequately and it was less than I would have paid through the college bookstore even with upgraded shipping. Had to have the book since the college bookstore ran out. I will definitely be back again when it is time to have books for next semester."
5,Patriotic song booklet,It was such fun to find this booklet - it was just what I was looking for and was shipped very quickly. Thanks very much!!!
1,Too drunk to even consider recording a live album,"Although entertaining, this CD features a J. Thunders who is simply too drunk to play. He doesn't even play guitar here (although he makes many references to giving it a try), the vocals are terribly slurred (more than usual), and the set isn't really that good. This CD is great for novelty purposes if you are a true fan, but it should not be your first J. Thunders CD."
3,Passionate but Un-academic,"The book is passionately written and includes a lot of interesting mini case studies, but not very many citations- especially citing other theorists who originated Seabrook's arguments. It might be a great primer for people who don't know much about the lived experience of poverty, but I would not use it in an academic context."
4,22-Minute Music Video - 5 Songs,Amy Grant sings 5 songs on this VHS from 1991:That's What Love Is ForGood For Me - very sexy videoBaby BabyEvery HeartbeatNext Time I Fall In Love - duet with Peter CeteraThe five videos are Amy at her best. The duet is outstanding.Music Videos (Marketplace 361/2)
2,Expensive Paperweight,"For the first six months I had this it was great, but then itstarted to freeze up and would flash ""Standby"" all night long.For the price that I paid for this system, I expect it too last awee bit longer. This is the second Sony DVD player that I've hadthat's broken down in under a year. The quality of Sony's DVD players has really deteriorated in the last few years, I wouldn't recommend buying a DVD player from Sony at all - and I certainly wouldn't recomend this one."
1,Sony FC9 A Defective Paper Weight,"I purchased this product when it first came out, for 1 year no problems, after the 1 year warranty the system freezez up its due to the overheating at the bottom of the unit, well I still have the thing what I did was remove the bottom cover drilled about 25 small holes this has been keeping the unit cooler this seems to do the trick for me also I made some custome legs giving it a custom 5""m lift witch adds to the cooling after owning it for now 6 years and having so many problems I think its time for an upgrade I think I will keep away from sony for a while"
1,DONT BUY SONY,Sony dream systems will break down within a year. I had mine for about two years and it worked fine for the first year but then started to freeze up and flash standby and the only way to reset it was to unplug it. This would work for maybe a half an hour when the problem would start again. For the price it should have lasted longer. Shame on sony for not recalling the product when so many people are experiencing the same product defect. I will never buy anything from sony again.
1,Terrible......,Terrible system. Mine actually worked for two years and then died. But their customer support is terrible and I'm looking at a $600 paperweight.......terrible.
2,Doesn't fit,Cute designs but they shrink. I have to stretch the sheet back out after washing it and when I attempt to put it on the mattress it flips up.
5,bassinet sheets,So happy to get these sheets they are very soft and the baby blue color is perfect bassinet sheets are hard to find in a store
2,LOVE the print and softness...but sheet was extremely too big,This might have fit better on a larger cradle but it was WAY too big for my regular sized bassinet. I kept it because I loved the print and it was super soft but had to really tuck it in good because of how big it was.
5,Bassinet sheet,We received an old bassinet from a friend for our new baby. The pad is smaller than some of the new ones so this sheet worked perfectly for us.
3,For Smart Phones only,"I originally purchased this software for my Palm PDA, but it is only compatible with smart phones with an internet connection. I am sure it is a great program if you have a smart phone, but if not, it is disappointingly uncompatible."
4,Very nice item,"Great for parties. I like it very much.Some of my utensils wont fit though, because the spacing is too narrow,A little less than half an inch.Other than that, its all good."
2,Beware! The Bottle leaks,I bought my bottle of Simply Smooth Dry Shampoo from a beauty supply chain. I've used it twice and owned it for a week and it's already empty. The store manager told me this product line has had a problem with the bottles leaking. So just be aware getting a refund or exchange is a pain in the butt. Otherwise from the two times I was able to use this product it worked pretty well. My hair did feel and smell clean.
1,Don't Bother,This video is very poorly made. The sound is poor. The picture quality is fuzzy. The instruction is vague. It's as if it was made in someone's garage.
2,Be Careful You Don't Already Have This,"The one thing I've learned through buying ANYTHING produced by the Discovery channel is that they have a tendency to replicate their DVDs under another name. Most (if not all) of this boxed set is already part of their Shark Week DVD sets. For that reason, I can't give it a more positive rating. The buyer is under the assumption that this is new footage when it clearly isn't. It's all old, recycled segments sold under a different name. Caveat emptor (let the buyer beware)."
2,Big mammoth--No Hat,"This book is a dreadful disappointment because the expedition was a bust. As a result, the author has injected a tedious history of mammoth hunting into the story--which is the story of struggling mightily to unearth and defrost an entire wooly mammoth. Unfortunately, the giant block of permafrost thought to contain an entire frozen beast yields only the usual bones and a small amount of mammoth flesh. According to the author, this mammoth flesh emits a distinct and odious aroma. So does this book."
2,Mildly interesting,"There is surprisingly little about the project of cloning mammoths. I'm not really sure what it's about; it's disorganized and kind of all over the place. There's some about the mammoths themselves (as living animals), some about the various adventures to find frozen mammoths in Sibera, and some about the science behind the cloning. While mildly interesting, it wasn't especially informative.Not terrible but not recommended."
4,Remove the black paint from the handle!,"It's a much nicer knife after you do the following:1. Improve the factory edge.2. Remove the black paint from the handle with paint stripper:- Spray entire handle with Jasco Paint Remover or Dad's Easy Spray and leave for 30 minutes.- Remove black paint with soft toothbrush or soft nylon brush under cool running water.- Dry leather with hair dryer.- Buff leather with 0000 steel wool to smooth rough and/or frayed areas.- Apply extra virgin olive oil and allow to absorb.- Optionally, you can rub in some Obenauf's LP or Sno Seal for water protection. Use the hair dryer to heat what doesn't absorb, and then rub in with your fingers. Repeat as necessary."
4,Sturdy Knife,"The knife has a 7"" blade with a 5"" handle. The handle is a painted stacked leather handle with a pinned pommel while the blade is .165"" thick and is made out of 1095 carbon steel with a zinc phosphate finish. The 498 has a rat-tail tang and comes with a black leather sheath.It is an ugly knife but because it is ugly, you won't be afraid to use it. that's the reason I got it. I have used the knife as a pry-bar, can opener, and as a hammer. After a couple of months, the knife has held up well. The 498 is easy to sharpen and has a decent edge retention. The only problem I had with the knife is when I bent the guard while using it but I was able to bend it back with pliers. the guard is a bit easy to bend so be careful not to hit it. The finish is starting to wear off but it held up surprisingly well. Overall, it is a VERY good high quality knife. Oh and it's made by the Ontario Knife Company right here in the USA."
2,Doesn't work for me.,Tried this antenna indoors. Did not pick a single HD channel. Placed it outdoor on my balcony and picked up a grand total of 1 HD station. I live in a major metropolitan area. Upgraded to an amplified Phillips (MANT510). Works significantly better. Picked up 5 or 6 HD stations. however not getting Fox at all.
4,Works as advertised,"This antenna receives UHF HDTV signals as advertised, and is the same as the Gemini ""Silver Sensor"" antennas sold under the Zenith brand (ZHDTV1).The only qualm is that this antenna is rather hard to find these days. I bought a $20 VHF/UHF antenna from Radio Shack that receives signals slightly better, is slightly cheaper, and can be returned to the store if it doesn't work in your area. The only downside to the Radio Shack antenna is that it isn't as aesthetically pleasing (it has rabbit ears for helping to receive signal)."
1,Antenna can barely pick up standard TV signals,"I bought the Phillips PM-HDTV1 antenna awhile ago, and It can barely pick up standard tv stations. The picture is very snowy and poor audio. I live in Minneapolis. I ended up getting DirecTV instead. Now I get a fantastic HD reception. Don't waste your money."
4,Cartland is a master,"Barbara Cartland's never written a book I didn't love. This novel was Regency in flavor, like most of hers, and was a little different in the personality of the heroine, who was spirited and intelligent. The romance developed slowly, but the end was warm and satisfying. You can't go wrong with Barbara Cartland."
2,"Good Watch, until band broke, not covered by warrenty",Bought this in April as a gift for my husband for our anniversary in April. He takes good care of his watches so he was surprised that the band broke in July. The warrenty clearly says it is not covered so bummer. Won't replace it with another one from Armitron.
1,Don't bother!,"I thought this was a collection of music videos, but it is not! It is all live performances, which most of sound horrible. Like one reviwer said, it's all 80s bands, but the performances are not from the 80's. This DVD is listed twice and the one I looked at had no reviews, so I had to write this to warn others. Don't bother!"
1,80's horrible music!,"I cannot believe how HORRIBLE this DVD video really is! Regardless of what die-hard fans may think of this, this die-hard metal fan doesn't like her picture quality so imperfect. It was that way on at least half of the DVD. The sound quality wasn't much better. So I do not recommend this DVD to anyone that wishes to waste their money on something that should either be recalled or TRASHED! I made time to do this review because I don't think any decent metalhead sure have to be this dissapointed, especially with the bands that play on this DVD because at least half of them are top-hit bands. Buyers BEWARE! This one's a major downer (dissapointment). Thanks, Mary"
2,mildly pleasant story but where is the romance?,"The plot turns on a young lady who likes to be helpful, she helps one of her two suitors to see that he ought to follow his dream and pursue a career in archaeology. Problem: there were no careers in archaeology in the period. Lord Elgin, the purported role model, was, depending upon your point of view, a collector or a thief. He waltzed into Athens, chipped the marbles off the Parthenon, and carted them off to Bloomsbury. All of the nattering about wives following their husbands to archaelogical digs is anacronistic to say the least. Nobody on earth had ever excavated a site until Queen Victoria was well into middle age. That said, the real weakness here is the very paltry romance. The heroine meets her Romeo a few times, we understand that they find one another intelligent, but no sparks fly, certainly there is no romantic tension. Oh, there is a very mildly interesting murder mystery."
5,He liked to give motorists a warning -,"The kind of cop i would like to pull me over - he liked to give traffic violators a verbal warning instead of a ticket, wish we had traffic cops like that here in Reno. But he built an 8 car garage and filled it up with stuff stolen from yachts. He had a WWII trainer plane, several corvettes, and his own yacht. A mild mannered cop who slept around on his wife, stole and was involved in three murders, but he hated to write tickets! His wife was an LA prosecutor, but she claimed she did not know about her hubbie cops illegal activities. She did not even know about his affair with a young Chinese woman. A great read - I could not put it down."
2,Bad cop -- OK book,"Having walked the same halls and worked the same streets, I found the book to be very accurate in most aspects. The book seemed to drag on for quite a while, it was like the author was getting paid by the word.It is just hard to believe that this DISTURBED person made it on the LAPD. Crooked cops should be shot -- including this #%*hole. I know you cop haters will say that all cops are disturbed, I can assure you otherwise."
4,Timely,"I haven't read this book yet, but it was shipped promptly and was in the condition described. I've already read some of the author's work, so I suspect I will like this book, as well.I would shop here again."
1,female character is annoying,I tried really hard to get into this anime but the main female character was just absolutely asanine and annoying that it repulsed me.
4,Good but unfinished.,"Cecily is a knight. Unfortunately she ends up getting saved more than she ends up saving people. On one such occasion she is saved by the blacksmith, Luke. She becomes friends with Luke and begs him to forge a magic katana for her. An mystery man is unleashing demons on the land. Cecily and Luke must fight to protect their country from the evil demons.This series is well made. It has good animation, voice actors, and a good soundtrack. There are plenty of good characters, laughs, and action. The story is pretty solid as well. It doesn't finish though. It was released in 2009, so there may be a possibility for a 2nd season. I liked this series and I recommend it to any anime fan. I believe it's worth 4 stars b/c it leaves ya hanging. However, if they finish it it'll probably get 5 stars. I can't give 5 stars to an unfinished work. Even so it's still worth watching."
4,Broadening one's horizons,"Jerry Hopkins offers a glimpse into the wonderful world (universe really) of truly exotic foods, ranging the stinky fruit durian, which he refers to at one point as being like eating ice cream in an outhouse, to rats (not consumed often enough as far as I'm concerned) to even his son's placenta, which the author warns you to de-vein if you are to serve to party guests.My only complaint, and it is a slight one, is that the book seems to be a little too concentrated on the cuisine and customs of Southeast Asia, which is somewhat understandable give the fact that Hopkins resides in Bangkok. However, I would have liked to seen some more information on Gamle Ole or the maggot cheese which is consumed in Sardinia, or hakarl (Greenlandic Shark)."
1,Promoting New Forms Of Animal Slaughter,"There is no logical reason that turkeys and chickens should be more often butchered than other forms of birds, nor that some fishes are more often eaten than others. However, it is a negative thing to widen the list of animals falsely termed edible. END"
3,Great Daddy/Daughter Songs,I have been looking for something like for a while now. I can't wait to play one of the selections at my wedding.
2,Ehhh,"This one didn't thrill me. It didn't feel like it was from the time era. Sure, throw in an old car and a dance and it's 1939? Um no, the language felt recent, the story line felt recent. It all felt a little stale to me. This one is not out of the ordinary. You can pick this type of book up from anywhere, it's a common blueprint. If you want something fresh, this isn't it."
1,Keep looking,"I purchased the expensive Sony CD-RW Drive thinking Sony's name stood for something, I realized was wrong. I have two major problems with Sony, 1-The advertise software that came with my drive is not the full version software. That was not stated in Sony's product specification that named the included software. 2-After my first attempt to resolve a problem with their customer care on-line service it took two more attempts and approximately one week's time to get unsatisfactory results. The drive does work but I think a less expensive brand would work just as well. My recommendation is save money and buy something else.Keep looking....Dave"
1,Amazon blew this one!,"I ordered this set on April 12, 2012. I got it an hour ago. Imagine my annoyance to discover that Amazon sent me a Spanish language version. On the Amazon site, two versions(with identical covers), are listed. The one I ordered and the ""Imported Latino Version"", that I actually received. I'm frankly mad as hell. I will have to make a special trip to thepost-office or UPS store. Worse, other customers have also been burned on this. When is Amazon going to fix this listing?While I'm in a complaining mood, I'll also mention that the video quality is fairly poor. I suppose that this is a natural consequence of putting 780 minutes of video on just 4 DVD's. Soft focus and weak colors aside, it's still a great series. But, a set with an episode list I cannot even read, is not exceptable. Sorry Amazon, I think the world of your service generally, but you blew this one."
1,Dangerous Nonsense,"I came across a video of the authors explaining why they wrote such a wretched book.[...]The thing that is missing now is a public apology for this failed attempt to stir up rivalry, suspicion and hatred between Japan and the USA.Far from recanting in the face of overwhelming evidence that he was wrong, Friedman continues to peddle these same discredited views, simply pushing out the date as far as 2050 when he won't be around to answer for his sins.Let this video be a warning to anyone who would buy Intelligence from his company Stratfor.While it is as punishing to watch as the book would be to read (if the thing ever got back in print), the video of them is worth viewing if only as a good reality check against sentiments currently being expressed by many others about China.There is a priceless piece towards the end where Australia and the UK were deemed 'less free' than the USA..."
1,Our Gophers Did Not Eat This - They Pushed It Back Up!!!!,"I've come to the conclusion that the gophers in our yard will not eat these pellets.I've bought 3 packages so far, and have been diligently putting them down in the gopher holes for weeks now, however I will no longer purchase this product, after I saw that the gophers not only are not eating the pellets but they are pushing them back up out of their tunnels.This is a big problem for me because when the gophers push the pellets back out, then my dog can eat them. Which I realized he was doing after he came inside and barfed on the carpet.Maybe these will work for you, but they are definitely not working for me."
1,Useless against moles,"We have lots of tunnels and round mounds (without a visible hole) ... we have moles. We sprayed oil based repellants four times over 2 month without any luck. After that we tried the poison. What a waste. Now our front- and backyard are trashed with tunnels showing everywhere. Using the lawnmower and experiencing the tunnels everywhere makes me so angry.Some more research revealed that moles will never eat anything that is not living. Water, poison and gas are useless and I find any manufacturer who markets these as solutions against moles as fraudulent and you avoid all of their products!Good news, today I put out a scissors type trap and caught the first mole within 8 hours.Look for fresh straight tunnels along your house or yard and place the trap as instructed. Good luck."
1,Don't Buy,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. It simply doesn't work. I purchased this product along with the havahart trap. The chipmunks ate these so called poison peanuts like candy. Its been over 2 weeks, and the 1 chipmunk that was captured, I releasd after he ate about 15 of these peanuts. I tagged the chipmunk and 1 week later, I caught him again. So these peanuts don't work."
1,Don't Bother With This Method,"We've tried many things for the moles in our neighborhood. The Senoret Chemical Mole Poison was one method tried. In a nutshell, it doesn't do anything. Doesn't help at all.Our next door neighbor had great luck withLiquid Fence 167 Mole Repellent. This will move the animals off the treated area and perhaps a bit farther. If you live in a residential area most likely this method will just move the moles down the street a house or two. Sooooo.... if you dislike your neighbors. :-)Good luck. Moles are sneaky buggers and difficult to get rid of. I think we finally got rid of ours due to larger critters eating them. It's theCircle Of Life."
1,Not work at all,I am honestly to tell this product is not work for me at all. Gopher pulls the bails out of tunnel.
3,Best Practice Is Common Sense,"As part of my school's curriculum committee, Best Practices is on our assigned reading list. After reading the introduction I was shocked to find the book not only interesting, but also easy to read. The book's main premise is that school reform, what ever direction a school chooses to take, is a process, not a magic potion. Meaningful school reform, according to the authors, could and prbably should take at least three years. No one standardized test and no one curriculum can be a cure-all for improving student performance. Best Practice tells how to begin the process of reform to produce improved student performance in an environment dedicated to that process."
2,Disappointed,"I thought, ""well, the cover looks great, and a review was o.k, so it must be something I would be interested in"". Boy was I disappointed! I have been bellydancing for 3 years...and too be honest I couldn't stop shaking my head. The picture was awful...I thought her veil unwrapping looked terrible, and as for her instruction, it was rushed, and not very discriptive at all. I thought she looked ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this video at all. Learn basic moves and you could do a better job at seduction all on your own. Save your money!"
3,Trainers: Keep this one handy.,"As corporate trainers and authors of books for trainers, we keep a lookout for quality and innovation in our field.

5,Nobody's Perfect,"Jana and Grace have been friends since they were kids however; sometimes with this familiarity, contempt is what comes along with love and mutual respect. The jealousies are obvious in this tale and at first seem very one sided until you read deeper between the lines.Ms. Stormer wrote a subtle story that will make you blush from the truths you may be forced to face...maybe even about yourself. Although written under the genre of Christian Fiction, Healing the Breach transcends the lines that divide. I think it's a must read for anyone whose had a friend and lost them...and didn't want to face the reasons why.--review by Michelle McGriff"
5,Bugle Calls,"I've been looking for this, What's bad about this I remenber alot of these and that gives my age away. It's nice to listen to them again."
4,It was great.,It was great. The four of them had the memories of the time when Lucy told Ricky she was going to have a baby and the time Lucy said it was time she was going to have the baby.
2,not really xmas'y,this vid does show a little bit of christmas stuff but its mostly flash backs of when lucy and ricky were first married and shows lots of ricky singing. i didnt really like it.
3,It was ok for the first 1.5 years,"This was a GREAT keyboard at first, i loved it a lot, i liked the style of the keyboard, and the overall look of it. I dont use the media stuff, but mainly got it because of the shape of the keys. It was working great until about 4 months ago when i would have to retype works, etc. The receiver is about 2 inches away form the keyboard/mouse, and i have trouble double clicking, and i had to finally make one of the extra buttons on the mouse a double click button. It is really pissing me off, and i am not sure if i am going to replace this keyboard with the same or a different one, but it has to be the same keyboard style"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"After reading many of the reviews of this item, I was wary of what to expect, but after receiving it, the keyboard has worked out quite great.Other than a very sensitive space bar...this is a keyboard that I highly recommend. Good wireless signals on both the keyboard and the mouse even from a distance.Well worth it"
2,Doesn't really work,"I have had this combo for a while and tried to like it, but really can't. The main problem is the radio signal. Constantly dropped letters while typing and the mouse just plain drops out with no rhyme or reason. I have found with the mouse that if you bash it on the desk (and I mean really smack it), it comes back to life (so I guess you can say its durable since I bang on it all the time). The keyboard feels nice to me and the shape is good, but it really is just too unreliable...I spend more time correcting than typing! This one is going on the junk pile soon and getting replaced by something from Logitech who at least never seem to have issues with radio signal.BTW, I mentioned to a friend at Microsoft who works in their hardware group how much I disliked this keyboard. When I told hm the model number he just rolled his eyes, so I guess this is not exactly a surprise to him."
1,Worst EVER,"This keyboard and mouse suck!The Keyboard keeps missing letters when you type fast, and the mouse got all jittery after about 5 months!I'm going back to Logictech"
3,Not as good as the old Natural Wireless,"Got this to replace an old MS Wireless Natural keyboard thinking the ""new"" ergonomics might be better. After 2 weeks I noticed hand pain and sent it back and went back to the old keyboard...pain is gone again."
4,Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 6000 V2,"The keyboard and mouse are very well designed with the exception that the caps lock key is very close to my little finger and it is easy to inadvertently hit, causing a need to retype. But, overall, I really like the quiet, easy key strokes. I have yet to use all of the perks with the keyboard, and am working on setting the whole thing up. The laser mouse is one the best I have ver used, even though others are more ergonomically designed. Again, I would recommend this keyboard and mouse to anyone wanting a wireless set."
2,Not that Bad,"I've had two of these. first did not work and the second died this month after 14 months of owning it.it's a really nice little system when it works. Very comfortable and all, but after 12 months the mouse started sticking, there was a wireless response delay, and finally it just quit altogether.i would not buy this item if I could do it again.I've had this longer now. I returned my first one and the second unit I got has been GREAT. So I thought honesty required I come back and revise. I'd give it 4 stars today"
5,Very good product !!,Have been using it for almost a day now and find this to be a very good product so far. I would definetly recommend this product to a friend.
1,Horrible Product!!,"Stay away from this if you need a range larger than 2 ft. It is rated for 6 ft, but I constantly got a low signal warning from the mouse. Used it with my laptop in a laptop/projector home theater setup for gaming and movies. The keyboard is nice, with lots of customizable buttons. My biggest complain is the software (Intellipoint). As always, Microsoft does what its best at: Thinking it knows whats best for you. Intellipoint went ahead and disabled functionality in my laptops touchpad. So when I'm not using the wireless desktop combo I basically have little or no functionality on my laptops touchpad. Tried to go into control panel/device manager to reset settings and it totally got rid of the settings for the touchpad. It's as if there was no touchpad at all. Went ahead and returned it in less than 24hrs."
3,Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop,Very diffcult to adjust the keyboard's impulse signal. This resulted inhaving to adjust and readjust the reciever numerious times in order to get the correct signial. Once it was achieved then the operation was very good.
3,"Best keyboard feel, but missed keys and lousy mouse","The keyboard itself is amazing. Best feel ever, you can't even compare other keyboard to how good this one feels. But: wireless induces some missed keys, especially double characters ""ee"" would miss the 2nd, and SHIFT + character, so CAPS letters sometimes are just missing.Mouse is OK but not ergonomic AT ALL. Microsoft has a good ergonomic mouse, the 6000 model... but it's sold standalone and it should be in this pack."
2,Touch typists beware,"This keyboard has a nice soft touch, and I have not experienced too many connection issues. But there are two major problems with it.First, it misses keys consistently. If you are a fast typist this will drive you nuts, because by the time you realize that it had missed a key, you have already typed in quite a few other characters, and need to go back to adjust.Second, all of the keys have a very low profile. I don't know if this contributes to ergonomics, but for me it's a problem when using the modifier keys, especially the control key. I may not be in the mainstream, but I need to hold the control key down for a lot of what I do on the computer (editing in Emacs mostly), and because the keys are so low, trying to hold down the control key along with another is quite a challenge.Overall I would not recommend this keyboard."
2,Range Not As Advertised,I have my PC connected to my HDTV and I bought this keyboard so that I could sit on my sofa 10 feet away and use my HDTV like a PC monitor. The wireless laser keyboard 6000 v2.0 is advertised to work up to 30 feet away from its receiver but it barely works at 6 feet. Sometimes it will work from 10 feet away but it misses half of what is typed. The range of the mouse that came with it is even less. The keyboard works fine within 3 feet of the receiver but the mouse is sluggish and sometimes unresponsive at any range.
2,Keyboard connectivity unreliable,"Five stars for the design and comfort but I'm finding the keyboard connectivity hopelessly unreliable, even on an empty desk with the keyboard just a few inches from the receiver. The keyboard regularly drops characters and often packs up altogether."
5,Great Key Board,"Response time better than any Logitech I ever owned. Quiet, comfortable. I would highly recommend this one to anyone spending alot of time on the computer."
3,Some annoying glitches,"The best part of this product is the keyboard - quiet and very comfortable for this female touch-typist. However, I have three issues with the product -- (1) right-handed, too-large mouse (I'm a left-handed 'mouser'), (2) constant warning ""signal quality low"" (the transmitter sits on my desk less than a foot from both the mouse and keyboard) and (3) interference with some applications - particularly games and screen saver. In perusing other reviews, I think the warning is generated due to interference from a radio transmitter in my office - okay, I can deal with that. I've learned to use the uncomfortable mouse, but it's annoying. What may make me ditch this product is the interference with applications. We'll see."
2,"OK for typing, terrible for gaming.","If you are a gamer, do not get this keyboard. It's sticky and sluggish for AWSD movement.I have to go back to my wired keyboard when I play games."
4,Great desktop keyboard combo,"This keyboard is great! I ordered one thru my work and use it 8+ hours a day. I liked it so much I purchased another one thru amazon for my personal use at home. The Keyboard is QUIET, comfortable, great quick key features for opening internet, email, etc with a push of a button. The built in wrist/palm rest is an added bonus and feels great. The keyboard itself does lay a little flat, even with the legs down. I prefer an upward incline. The laser mouse is so fast and accurate, not much movement required at all. Very happy with everything it has to offer. I have had NO connection problems with either one of mine as some others have said. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality, quiet, option packed wireless keyboard and mouse combo."
3,Works but could perform a little better. Mouse gets stuck and keys don't always type.,"I ordered this desktop set about 2 months back. It arrived in matter of days. Getting it installed and starting to using it, was quite easy. But it is not really portable. The dongle that acts as connecting bridge between mouse & keyboard and desktop is size of the mouse itself; as against to the modern small USB adapters we get these days. So if you wanted to use this mouse somewhere else, you are actually carrying 2 mice. Also, all the extra features are not really readily available, you need to install them specifically.But Keyboard is really ergonomically beneficial. Some of the keys on my keyboard are not really guaranteed to type- like a, t, d and c. I have to always double check, they actually got typed out. The mouse gets goofed up a lot of times too.. So all in all, its not a completely satisfying piece of equipment, but gets the job done. I would not recommend buying it."
2,Worked great for 12 mos then Keyboard failed,"The mouse and keyboard worked great for 12-13 mos but then the keyboard failed. Searching the web, this is not uncommon. I'm becoming disallusioned with my microsoft recently (this, Xbox 360 early failure, conversion to WM 6.1, and of course Vista. Planning to switch to Apple laptops and phones. More expensive but a much better experience."
2,Not a good one.,This one is bad. After about a week's use one of the arrow keys is not popping up after pressing it. I removed the key to see what the problem is and found the plastic sheet under the key has a hole ... probably b/c i might have pushed it a bit harder at one point. But i don't think that should put a hole in the sheet. Unfortunately i threw away all the packing and can't even return the product.
2,Great keyboard but bad wireless interference,"This is a great keyboard, a lot of customizable keys and very comfortable. The thing that makes it a bad keyboard is the wireless interference. im using it from 4 feet away and the mouse will lose signal. i use it on my bed and my bed is higher than the receiver so i have to get on the very edge of my bed. it frustrates me every time i use it. I have a bluetooth keyboard (MS 8000) and it has no loss of signal. that's why i gave it a 2 star. if you want to use on your bed, couch or anywhere far from your pc, buy a bluetooth keyboard."
2,"No matter how good a keyboard feels, it's useless if you can't type with it.","I like the feeling of the mouse. I like the feeling of the keyboard. I hate that this has terrible, terrible connectivity.I've had this keyboard/mouse for a week and plan on taking it back tomorrow. Why? Because at seemingly random intervals it suddenly decides to stop accepting input. My backspace key is getting an extra workout due to all of the missed letters, that is if the backspace key-presses are even recognized.The reciever is also literally right next to the keyboard right now, so it's certainly not obstructions in the way.It even sometimes has bouts where it only accepts one out of every five or six key presses. This keyboard is a joke, and I'm honestly surprised that it made it to market being this bad.This set is a waste of time and money. I guess I'll try out Logitech."
2,Good except skips keys,"I like the ergnomics of this keyboard and the the quiet typng, but as you can prbably see, there is a serious problem with skipped letters. I can hardly write a single sentence without an issue. I think it's gotten to the point where I need to retur the item and maybe try a different brand."
1,Terrible choice,Keyboard keys are small and feels like cheap plastic. Function buttoms and esc key are microscopic. My biggest complaint is the lag. There is a terrible lag while typing and comes out as jibberish once it acknowledges input. The keyboard is less than 1 ft. away from the transceiver so it is not the distance. I don't recommend this keyboard to anyone who plays online games for this matter.Mouse buttons are small and also feels cheap. For this price I would expect something better from Microsoft. This combo was truely a dissapointment.
5,Laser mouse and keyboard,"Both have worked flawlessly since I purchased them. I'm glad I decided to use them instead of going with the standard wired mouse and keyboard. I thought at first I would miss the ""trackball"" that I'm use to using, but I haven't at all."
3,"Great features, poor quality","The features and ergonomics of this keyboard are excellent, but I frequently have to re-type letters. Question marks and Ctrl-C or Ctrl-V combinations give me the most problems. I'll type these and hear the key clicks, but nothing happens on screen. This is really frustrating.Also, the programmable shortcut keys are terrific, but I could use about 8 or 10 of them instead of 5."
2,"Great Keyboard, Horrible Mouse","The mouse quality is horrible.The mouse precision is horrible. Almost everytime click is missed, on the other hand The keyboard is really comfotable. It's very quiet when typing. But since it's wireless it misses keys when typing for a long time. Don't waste your money on this product it's not worth. The mouse is horrible always has signal problems and always misses clicks."
2,Don't buy if you use the number pad a lot!,"I love the mouse, but the number pad on the keyboard is terrible! The keys are so low, that you have to depress them down past the surface of the keyboard, so it makes it very awkward to hit the ""0"" key with your thumb. I'm keeping the mouse, and replacing the keyboard with a good ole IBM Model M."
4,Slightly Annoying,"I enjoy my keyboard and mouse set. It is comfortable to use and the scrolling function on the mouse is great.However there are two small drawbacks. First, both the keyboard and mouse go through batteries more frequently than some other keyboard and mouse sets I've had. I use rechargeable batteries since regular ones don't last more than a couple days. Second, the keyboard and mouse, especially the mouse, don't like to be more than two feet from the hub. Its annoying to have a wireless keyboard and mouse and still not be able to use it from any distance from the desktop. In my case its fine since I'm usually typing from the desk and I have wireless to prevent wires from being caught in my sliding keyboard tray or eaten by my cats.Overall it is a good set as long as you're not planning to use it 24-7 or from across the room from its hub."
5,Best keyboard ever owned,"I also own the MS Desktop 5000. The 6000 is an upgraded version as the mouse is a little bit more ergonomic and the keyboard smoother and quieter. The keys are low profile, like on a laptop and very fast. The layout is perfect but the keyboard is rather long so it is not suited well for small spaces. If you have enough room for it on your desk then it's probably the best keyboard money can buy in that price range, a lot better than any Logitech I've seen or owned to date."
1,Consider yourself warned,"When my original HP mouse died, I went to Office Depot and spotted this combo. It looked nice, and since it was Microsoft, I assumed it worked as it should. I came home and read some of the dismal reviews posted here but decided to take a chance. It is by far one of the worst products I have ever purchased. Why? The mouse works fine. I have no problem with connectivity (as I test, I pointed the keyboard in the opposite direction of the receiver and it still worked). The problem is MISSED KEYSTROKES! It is impossible to type much of anything without having to backspace to try a character or space again. I e-mailed Microsoft and got a useless response from Habib. Again, consider yourself warned.UPDATE: I'm officially throwing this hunk of junk in the garbage today. I cannot deal with it anymore. If these are still available, and you're thinking about buying one, DON'T!!!"
1,This is one POS keyboard.. DO NOT BUY!!,"I bought the Laser Desktop 6000v2 hoping it would be better, but sure enough, this is the keyboard from hell.I have the wireless receiver infront of me, and if I moved it 5-10"" away from the receiver , it will not work. So much for the wireless part.Now comes the mouse, right click would have some crazy delay or no click at all, battery brand new and mouse infront of the receiver.I am about to cry, but the function on the keyboard, like music , volume placement I like.UPDATE: I called Microsoft about this problem and they promptly send out another replacement for me, I thought the issue will go away, NOPE, same thing. It is driving me so crazy that I have to plug in a cord mouse juse to make sure it is not me that's going crazy, because mouse click will not register untill the 10th click, I have to use the cord mouse to click it... God, this ikeyboard is AWEFUL !!"
1,Went through 3 of them - none worked,"I purchased this keyboard about a month ago and right out of the box the mouse would only work about 1 out of every 3 times I clicked it. I exchanged it for a new one and the keyboard would not drop random keystrokes. I exchanged for a third, same story. All this while the batteries and wireless signal are reported to be ""excellent"". Perhaps I've had bad luck but three bad keyboards in a row is enough. I've returned it and written Microsoft keyboards off as not fit for use."
2,"Great feel, Unreliable wireless","While the keyboard looks and feels great, there is nothing more frustrating than an unreliable keyboard. If you can live with a missed key every now and then, or the fact that the mouse doesn't always click when you do, then by all means... buy this keyboard. Be prepared to spend an hour installing all the bloatware that comes with it.If you are like me, and find yourself slowly going insane not knowing if that last keystroke or mouse click made it... then avoid this and all microsoft hardware. Check out the Logitech line of hardware instead.If you read a review about how great this keyboard is, keep in mind that it can take months for the missed key problem to kick in."
2,Terrible Wireless,"I've owned this keyboard for 5 years. The keyboard feels good and has good ergonomics, along with a good layout and a number of very useful special buttons around the edges. It's decent for word processing and the like.The wireless connectivity is virtually nonexistent. Never ever, ever buy this for gaming or if you want to type for more than a couple seconds without it missing a character. Sometimes, I can move the mouse a few inches without getting any response on the screen. This isn't an issue with batteries or transmitter placement, as I've tried all the solutions prescribed by Microsoft.Early on, when I first got the keyboard, the problem wasn't that pronounced, but now, it's almost unusable. I have to go back every other word to fix a letter that has been omitted by the failed connection."
1,Mushy Keyboard and Horrible Mouse,The keyboard continues to miss keys if you type fast. The mouse has to be almost on top of the wireless reciever to work. The range for both the keyboard and the mouse is about 12 inches from the wireless receiver. Buy a Logitech mouse and use a wired Microsoft keyboard.
2,Dissappointing!,"I have had the product for 2 months now and have always experienced poor connection for the mouse. Wish I had read some of these reviews prior to buying! Love the look and feel of both, but the mouse click just stops working periodically with no warning. VERY frustrating. I have to put the mouse right next to transmitter, and then it doesn't always work! Haven't experienced the problem with the keyboard though (hence 2 stars). But I do keep getting messages ""keyboard out of wireles range"" even though it's within 1 1/2 to 2 Feet of transmitter!! Very poor for Microsoft."
5,Very nice keyboard and mouse - worth the money,"I purchased this basically to get rid of the wires on my home office computer. Turns out, I love the keyboard. It's very nice and easy to type on. The setup was pretty easy, although my mouse didn't work initially and I had to go to microsoft's knowledge base to figure that out. There's a little connect button on the bottom of the mouse that syncs it up with the main station. I pressed tha it's worked perfectly since then. If there's one bad thing, the documentation is very limited but otherwise it's been great. Highly recommend."
1,"Keyboard -- nice, Mouse -- yuck!","I've had this keyboard/mouse pair for some time now, and I've always thought I was just killing the batteries, or I just couldn't click to save my life. Turns out I'm not the only one that can't make the mouse click half the time! The keyboard is nice enough, but the mouse stinks. Left-clicks (the normal click) are lost quite often, as if the hardware just isn't registering the mouse. I'd say I have a defective unit, but google it a little and you'll see I'm not the only one. Many people have problems getting this mouse to register left-mouse clicks. And a mouse that doesn't click is as useful as ... um... might be the most useless thing I can think of.Don't waste your time with the unit, buy something else.Grrr... just had to click on ""Edit"" 7 times to get mouse to register my attempt to edit my own post!"
1,JUNK!,"No good. The keys are mooshie and do not react well.I tried playing a game with it. I held down the W and D keys together to move forward and turn. When I let go of the D key, I kept turning.I need to say no more."
1,Worse mouse ever,If there was a rating in negative i would give it thatthe mouse which comes with this set is the worse mouse i have seen in my entire life ... even worse than a ball mouse full of dirt ... my receiver sits <1 foot from it and it still cant work properly ... the pointer goes in all direction other than where i want it to go ... i STRONGLY recommend NOT to buy this product
1,Very dissappointing,"What a disappointment! The keyboard is simply awful. Think of a cramped laptop keyboard with all the keys at subterranean level but arranged on a large base like a regular keyboard. This is what the keyboard is like and like a laptop keyboard it is very hard to type accurately with it. The mouse isn't that great, either. It is gigantic. I do like the image-zoom feature it gives you but that's about it. Under $40 for a combination wireless keyboard and mouse seems like a bargain until you actually use the things. I'm probably going to throw the keyboard away and just use the mouse until I can replace the mouse with a Logitech MX600."
1,"Crabby POS keyboard, stay away....","At first this keyboard/mouse combo looks and feels great, but things will change quickly.Soon you will be greeted by the annoying out of range trouble shooter no matter where you place the receiver. The keyboard often misses some letters, so if you're a fast typist, this one is not for you. The laser mouse is ok, but not as fast or precise as any cheap mouse.After 15 months; the keyboard stopped working completely for no apparent reason. It has since been sent to the trash and replaced with the awesome Logitech illuminated keyboard, save your money and stay away from the ""Me Too!!"" Microsoft."
2,Too many missed keystrokes and too big,"Had it for a month and this is the least pleased I've been with a keyboard. It misses far too many keystrokes (the receiver is close by), I end up stomping on combo keys and double checking everything. And the keyboard is unexpected long, longer than any I've owned previous. It was not something I thought I needed to check, but my kb drawer will not easily accommodate this kb. The keys themselves feel quite nice, as others have mentioned. In every other respect I think this thing is abysmal and I have put it away.The included mouse is a bit clunky, but I bought it intending to keep my logitech mouse.Why did I buy it? I bought the 6000 v2 at Staples because the guy told me they were slashed down to $30. Who could say no to that price compared to the $99 suggested retail, and it looked great on the box. Now I know why they were dumping them so cheap."
1,Good if you Type slow,I consider all of the keys that I hit to be important. I had to slow down in order to have all of my key strokes register. They mouse was great. Comfortable and responsive. I am trying to find this specific mouse so that I can purchase it separately
4,Comfortable keyboard and mouse,"The bend on this keyboard is perfect... not too much, like the older ergonomics... just a smooth curve. Set-up was easy (even with Windows Vista... just make sure you have the Internet hooked up so it can update its drivers off the web), and the software makes customizing the soft-keys really easy.Not a big fan of the side buttons on the mouse, they sometimes get pressed if it knocks into the side of the keyboard... and the preset ""Magnify"" feature can be a little annoying. I disabled it, and everything is fine.All in all, a good combo unit, with pretty decent wireless range."
5,Perfect!,"This keyboard and mouse are wonderful, even with the Mac I paired them with. Great touch and perfect extras!"
4,A Worthy EP From A Great Band,"If you are a big Edge of Sanity fan, like me, then you might like this EP. The main reason I bought this CD was mainly for collection purposes, to own every EOS release. I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised that all 4 songs were really good. I gave this 4 stars for all 4 songs being pretty good. This is not some small masterpiece from EOS but it is worthy of owning if you aren't sure about it. I like how they were some of the songs that didn't go onto the Purgatory Afterglow CD because they probably wouldn't of fit well on that CD, but they are interesting songs by themselves."
4,Works & is low profile!,"Such a simple idea yet really effective! We have cats that kept getting into the pantry, so we bought this lock. It wouldn't fit on the top of the doors because of the hinges up there, but I was able to put it on the bottom part of the doors and I just slide it out of the way with my feet to get in the pantry. Putting it on the bottom is probably not a great solution with small children, but it works great if you have pesky pets!"
3,just okay - yet to find better though,"these don't fit our doors perfectly (with the inner ""adjustment"" piece, it's too tight & w/out, it's too loose). Our doors must not be standard depth. The other door locks (w/twist button) work just as well in my opinion (we now have both kinds). Both still allow for some ""give"" and similarly seem a bit flimsy ... with enough force i think either kind would break easily, but not something I suspect my 1 yr old will be able to do."
5,This is the first and only bi-fold door lock that works well and easily!,I have tried 4 other brands so I was skeptical when I came across this one. But it is super! It is easy to use and it keeps those doors shut from any toddler!
2,Pulling the door hard enough will cause the lock to pop off.,This worked great for the first 2-3 weeks to keep our 30 month old out of the pantry. Then I found our daughter starting to pull things out of the pantry and couldn't understand how she was getting the door opened. Well it took 30 seconds of waiting to see what the problem was - she learned if she just pulled the door hard enough the lock will pop off and she can get into the pantry. So now I am struck with an useless lock that is no match to a 30 month old toddler.
3,"Somewhat sticky and quirky, but it works well","Product does what it says it does ...prevents folding closet doors from opening. The only issue with this is that the width of the slider is slightly small for most of my closet doors. While some slide and glide nice and easy, others are a pain the butt to move back and forth. On a couple of doors it actually renders them ""adult""-proof....I can hardly slide it off the lock position, never mind our baby!"
3,NOT FOR METAL BIFOLD DOORS,"I'm giving this item a 3-star rating. I think its a really good idea, and see how the concept works, but it just doesn't work on METAL bifold doors. I wish I knew that before I ordered them. This item needs a thicker door to work."
3,They are Okay,These could be better of made of metal (Aluminium or Steel). I got three..two are already cracked because they are pretty fragile.
5,"Excellent, simple and extremely effective","We looked at Babys-r-us and found nothing like this. For the price I thought why not? Now I could not imagine having a toddler without these simple and completely useful little door locks. No hardware, no screws , nothing permanent. It just slides onto the top of the door and does the job."
5,Great solution,"We had problems with our cat prying open our folding doors in which products she shouldn't be near are located, and these have these plastic locks have proved to be an easy to use solution. Previously thought I'd have to put a latch lock of some kind which would have looked quite ugly, but these are barely visible from a distance."
4,Great Product,These work well and aren't a big pain for the parents to operate. All you have to do is open the door half way and pop them onto the top of the door. Then just use the pole to slide them back and forth to lock or unlock the door. Pretty simple.
4,Works well...,"This works pretty well, even with a five year old in the house. It was exactly what I needed. The only reason I gave it only four stars is because, like every other product like it in its class, it is made of plastic. I believe a metal option would work better, however it is made of some pretty durable plastic. My five year old has tried to get in and it has kept him out, however I have to tell other adults visiting that it is there, since it is made of clear plastic and an adult could break it..."
4,Does the job,"I was afraid that my son would crush his fingers in between our bifold doors on his never ending quest for new areas to explore. I ordered these, and they've worked perfectly. He rarely bothers the doors now, which pretty well renders these useless now, but the insurance of knowing these act as a deterrent are priceless! My only complaint about these are that they are rather flimsy, and difficult to open at times because they do not want to slide to the side. Despite this, I would still recommend these."
1,Too skinny,I have standard bi-folding doors and this is too tight to use across the seam. Have previously bought two (2) of the KidCo Bi-Fold Door Locks and those worked perfectly. Tried this one since it had free shipping. Lesson learned. Not even worth the postage to send this one back.
5,Safe option,"Easy to install, you literally just pop in on. These are clear plastic and you really don't even need the hanging stick (you will see it when you get it) if people in your home are tall enough to slide it over. These are awesome and it is very easy to get into the habit of opening and closing them, and walking around closing them after your husband- lol. They reduce the pinching risk 100% when used all of the time! Highly reccomend these."
1,Returned it right after opening,"We have bi-fold glass doors through out the house. So when I saw this product, I immediately thought this is perfect. Counted all doors and ordered accordingly just to return all of them when they arrived. Thankful for amazon's wonderful return policy to not create any problem.May be I was wrong in purchasing this as I think its designed for thick wooden doors. Don't know if it will work with them but it certainly does not work with the glass doors. The lock goes into the place without any problem, instructions are a little difficult to understand but you can figure it out if you follow the diagram carefully. After putting the lock on the door, when I opened the door, the lock traveled with the door. I was not able to open the door completely but the lock misses the purpose by letting the door open even slightly. Those little fingers will certainly get pinched with this lock.Overall design is good. Look gets mixed with the door because of transparent color."
4,Works for keeping cats out,"I have nosy cats that like to open any cabinet or closet they can get into. I was getting really sick of waking up every night to the sound of the cats opening the bi-fold closet doors in my bedroom and getting into trouble, so I bought two of these locks. They're very simple and do a good job of keeping the cats out. They still try to get in (sometimes I forget to slide them back when I close the doors), but when the doors are locked, they give up pretty quickly. The wands are useless, so I just slide the locks by the lip."
5,A little ingenuity goes a long way.,"I recently installed the Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock.**Problem** Unfortunately, our bi-fold doors are VERY thin. Even with the additional piece of plastic included for ""thinner"" doors, the mechanism still allowed the doors to potentially pinch our twins' small fingers.**Solution** We went to Lowe's and purchased a roll of 3M Interior Foam Mounting Double-Sided Tape. My husband and I cut 6 1/2"" strips (we needed 6 for each Bi-Fold Door Lock). We simply layered them on the small additional piece of plastic until we knew that, once assembled, we'd get the narrowness that we were looking for to restrict the door from ""bending"" too much (protecting little fingers). Since the tape is white, you'd never even know it wasn't an original part of the contraption. It sits on the back, inside the closet anyway. No one will ever see it.So far, it's working wonderfully."
2,Bad,The kids figured out within a week that all they had to do was apply more force to the door as they open it and the locks popped right off.
3,a smart kid can use a broom,"I've loved this for years for my first three children. But number four learned faster (from the others) how to climb up on chairs and use tools to access things...so it was a piece of cake for him to grab a broom (or toy lightsaber, etc.) and just slide the lock to one side by himself. I wish I could find a 2-step lock (like twist and slide) that could defeat him."
3,Not good for room doors only for closet doors,You can't access the lock from both sides of the door it's only accessible from one side of the door. This makes it only practical for things like closet doors and not room-to-room doors. Other than that flaw it does what it says it does.
2,Not very useful,"Ours is now just a piece of useless plastic, for two reasons:1) Our doors are 8' tall and the pathetic little plastic wand that they supply to slide it with isn't long enough for anyone less than 7' tall to use.2) It takes two - like many people we have a PAIR of folding doors and we thought that we were getting two of these, instead of just one. Maybe the advertizing should state that you only get one and not two as we had expected."
2,not recommend,"Product quality is fine.Cons: The size is 1/4"" smaller than regular bi-fold doors.So it is not easy to use if plan to open the door frequently.Pros: 1/3 price of brand name products."
5,Handy,"I'm setting up an amateur motorcycle garage with a few friends for fun. This has been pretty helpful. Some info is skewed to UK, but that's fine, the tips on dealing with tricky removal situations and general maintenance and stuff is helpful."
2,Show me the aura please!,"I'd hoped that this book would show me how to see it, but it is too scholarly to be of any practical purpose."
1,A comedy of belligerent inaccuracy,"I suspected, from the title of the book that there just might be something morosely comical about this book. And sure enough another self proclaimed ""authority"" has taken facts and interjected their opinion and presented a horrendous work that bears little resemblance to the truth. I thought Christians were supposed to be honest. Tsk, tsk, Burns, you certainly did not achieve any level of honesty here. The real farce however is not with the author but the publisher. How can any company put out this kind of garbage. No, I did not buy the book. I borrowed it and when I returned it, recomended to the owner that they use it for kindling or possibly get their money back."
1,awful,"i have to admit i did not finish this book. i was too saddened by the contents. how can anyone be so thoughtless and selfish as to write such trash is beyond me. AA spirituality is not subject to christian approval, and the author might as well get over it. it AA does not live up to the christians dogma, it is, simply, because it is NOT christianity. this book is absolute trash. if you bought it, get your money back from wherever you got it. awful."
1,"A self-help program that works, and doesn't cost ya a dime!","Obviously Dr. Burns must feel threaten by AA in someway, to be so closed minded is dangerous. But then she is not afflicted with the disease of alcoholism. Saying you can't be addicted to alcohol is like saying you can't be addicted to food, drugs, gambling and /or sex! Obviously Burns is on the out side looking in. Further more no where in AA literature does it state that AA is a religion, please people, know your facts before you write things, this is just another case of not knowing. Anyone that says things like ""alcoholism as a ""disease"" is a myth"" has never been stricken with it. There's an old saying ""don't judge a person until you've walked a mile in his shoes""."
1,"VERY, VERY, VERY MIS-INFORMATIVE","It's unbelieveable how someone as educated as the author can mis-inform so publicly. I agree with the ""sad"" review! 75% of alcoholics that follow the program outlined in the book Alcoholic Anonymous ""recovered"". I guess that isn't something the author ""researched"". If you're looking for a reason to justify staying away from Alcoholics Anonymous this is your book."
1,Hit Job on Good People,"Wow, the woman who wrote this is one of the most judgmental and ignorant writers I've ever encountered. She is completely clueless about the Christian roots of AA. I suggest, ""Dr."" Burns, that you check out someone called ""Dick B"" -- just type in his name in google and do a bit a REAL research. Save your money and check out the work of Dick B if you want to discover the Christian foundations of early AA."
1,It takes one to know one..,"If you want to know about Christianity, ask a Christian. If you want to know about alcoholism, ask an alcoholic. Please do not get information from self appointed experts who write hatefull books, and apparently have no clue about either. Faith, like recovery, is a personal endeaver between a person and the God of his understanding, and is not subject to anyone elses approval. To the God I have come to know, my being sober and happy is far more important than being religiously correct."
1,Ahistorical Tripe of the Fundamentalist Variety,"If you are a fundamentalist Christian looking for more reasons why the rest of the world is just plain wrong and scary, add this to your shelf: there is nothing here with which you will disagree. If you are an individual with a drinking problem, read this only if you have no intention of getting well. While God and the miracle of Alcoholics Anonymous continue to salvage the lives of individuals long since forsaken by friends and family, people like this still, in the words of St. Augustine, ""Sit in their ponds and croak, 'We're the only Christians.'"" Take the six dollars you would spend on this invective and give it to the poor. This is one of those rare books that is too obvious to work even as a foil. It will benefit no one--right, left or center. A true shame that the lowest rating permitted is one star: this is truly worthy of zero."
1,Hoo Boy! The very reason I choose 12 steps over the church.,"It's no wonder I was so eager to get out of the churches! I went until I was 13 years old and it never made sense. Just flipping through the pages of this book reminds me why being involved in a church was such a repulsive ordeal. PARANOIA! FEAR! FALSE PRIDE! IGNORANCE! BLIND JUDGEMENT! FALSE WITNESS! EGO! EGO! EGO!Thank God there are other ways to find God than in a church. It may work for some but not for many! AA saved my life and freed me from a life of misery. I'm no longer a member of AA (I joined a different 12 Step Fellowship more suited to my disease - hint hint), but I will forever remain thankful to the founders and members of AA for helping me get off the streets and back into society. Been clean for nine years! I am free!"
1,bashing for bucks,"I am horrified that anyone calling themselves a christian would dismiss or attack anothers faith, especially one that has brought that person recovery. To take a successful program like AA, and selfishly apply ones own religious standards, is the ultimate sin. When ms. burns has gotton 7 million people sober, i will liston to ms. burns opinion. please do not accept this book as anything but the religious based opinions that it is, and find out for yourself what alcoholics anonymous is about."
5,Garage door closes after 25 seconds,"My cousin left the garage door open and my $2,000 bicycle was stolen within minutes. However, since installing the doorminder, the door closes after only 25 seconds. I used to drive back to my garage to check if I had closed it. I don't have to do that anymore."
2,what happened?,we are fans of capella products..and were immensely surprised to find this a weaker tasting product than we expected as the other products have proven to be so excellant. Also as dispensed..the product came in a glass bottle that freely allowed an overuse...wasting the product! Usually these products are dispensed in a squeeseable bottle..so you can use just the amount you want to. BACK TO THE TEST KITCHEN WITH THIS ONE!!!!
2,Viewable Screen Shrinks,"How would you like to watch a movie that is 1 inch smaller (height wise) from the original viewable screen? Well look no further for this unit does this trick when you upconvert the DVD signal to 720P and 1080i via HDMI connection.I do agree that the picture quality looks great and you might not even have the ""shift issue"" but as JCP (the other reviewer) pointed out, there has been a significant number of users who have reported this on a home theater forum.The problem only exists if you are using an HDMI cable and upconverting the signals. Otherwise, 480P through HDMI or Component Video connections is OK."
2,Image Flaw - Image Shift on HDMI,"Pros: Excellent picture quality, 720p and 1080i upconversion over HDMI, ability to play mp3s from DVD, excellent sound.Cons: No 480i output over HDMI.Image Flaw: On a number of different TVs, there is a 1/2"" downward vertical shift via HDMI when selecting 720p upconversion and a 1"" vertical shift shift at 1080i. The picture is fine at 480p via HDMI.Many others in another popular home theater forum have also experienced this issue. It is not present on all TVs, but the number is significant. Calls to sony support by numerous individuals has yet to even get sony to log the problem.I have given the player 2 star due to its image flaw. If you will not be using the HDMI connections this will not be an issue and the rating would have been 4 or 5 otherwise."
1,Died faster than a fish outta water.,"I had this DVD player for maybe a month at best and one day i go to watch a dvd and nothing happens, keep in mind that i take care of my equipment with the utmost pride so therefore it had nothing to do with my ""misuse"" or ""handling"" of the player. It was kept in its own spot, dust free, with plenty of air circulation. Another thing, WHEN it worked it was not a 1080p upconverting player, nor was it compatible with Bravia Sync, which I wanted badly since I have a 1080p 40"" Sony Bravia HDTV. I am very disappointed.0 stars."
2,Definate artifact problems,"OK, before you think I'm crazy for giving this player a 2, read the article at the link below. This player has definate artifact problems, especially with dark reds (candelight, campfire scenes, etc). These artifacts don't occur when I watch HDTV through my tuner. Jagged edges and pixlization occur in all of the movies I've watched so far. Although this particular player has not been reviewed at the site below, several other Sony models have, and almost all of them have severe problems with their progressive scanning (you'll also find this in reviews of other Sony DVD players). I guess Sony is still having problems with this.The sound through the player is great though - comes through my Sony receiver great. Other gripes are that the AC chord is not detachable and the player doesn't come with an HDMI cable. I would recommend looking at other players before buying this questionable model.http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_7_4/dvd-benchmark-part-5-progressive-10-2000.html"
2,I don't recommend,"This documentary never quite reels you in. The story is great, but I'm a little shocked at all the 5 star reviews and praise. 5 stars to me means absolutely amazing, can't miss. This is hardly that. The doc has it's nice little moments but in the end leaves you neither better nor worse."
4,"Incredible Movie, Tasty Sushi","I thought this movie was a 4.5, so did my son. It's a wonderful story but a bit repetitive. You'll enjoy every bite!"
4,awesome movie and fast playback,Great experience with this movie and watching it on Amazon. i would do it again anytime. Plus the movie was fantastic
5,Perfect. Just spectacularly good.,"This movie is about sushi, but also really not at all about sushi. An 80-something master sushi maker is still at work, striving to make perfect sushi. The wonderful second story line here is: how can children live up to such great parents? How can we come into our own in the shadow of greatness? This theme is beautifully explored in this documentary. Jiro Dreams of Sushi is terrifically moving & inspiring, while also peppered with several really funny moments. The father and son are rich material for this story. Watching this is time well spent."
5,Wonderful piece,"I'm not a huge fan of documentaries, but the best ones are usually deserving of their reviews. I love sushi anyways, so seeing a documentary into the work ethic and discipline of the greatest sushi master in the world was entertaining. The general theme is on never giving up and pursuing perfection in whatever craft you decide to devote your life to. It's very interesting how something so ordinary as sushi can become a masterpiece when you have the right attitude."
