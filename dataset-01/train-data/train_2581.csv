4,We liked it.,"My wife and I have watched this show on a Dish Movie Channel. We found the show very good so I purchased one from Amazon to give to our daughter for a Christmas present. She was thrilled to get it and said it was one that she had thought about buying for herself. Myself, I didn't know much about Christina Aquilera, but I have really enjoyed her singing. We have watched it over and over. Good Show!"
2,Cher and Christina combine for a lengthy music video,"This movie is either an extended music video for Christina Aguilera or a PG-13 version of Paul Verhoeven's so-bad-it's-good ""Showgirls"". Don't get me wrong, the skin that's shown is just fine, just no naughty parts. While the production numbers are OK, the film doesn't have one creative idea. We've seen the story a hundred times, told a hundred times better. This film is also hampered by some pretty bad acting with Cher the worst of the bunch. Aguilera isn't great, but she didn't have much to work with so I'd give her another shot. I did like a couple of the somber original songs, one by Cher and one by Christina although they had no relevance to the scene in the film. Pass.The Blu ray transfer is very good from all aspects. It is presented in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio. The picture, while not reference quality is very good. The DTS HD MA 5.1 lossless audio is spectacular and makes good use of all the speakers."
3,"great movie, not a great CD","I was so thrilled to get this, I gave a good review BEFORE I watched the movie. It sticks, stops, whatever, ceases to run. One has to hit FF then play really quickly as so not to miss too much of the one section. I can live with it, not all that thrilled about it, but in the scheme of things, it's only a small inconvienence....."
3,As expected,"This movie was as expected, typical storyline in a differnt setting. Liked the music,but a bit boring at times a alright movie.."
3,"The process was quick and it was shipped fast, however......","The process was quick and it was shipped fast, however I couldn't get the DVD to play in my new DVD player with Blue Ray. It did play in my room though I wanted to watch it on the big screen with surround sound."
2,slapdash editing,"For those of you who are considering the purchase of this DVD, I have one piece of advice: don't! A high school film class could have done a better job of putting this thing together.For starters, the main portion of the video is only 27 minutes long. Next, the video resolution is so poor in some sections as to be almost worthless. Additionally, the audio was set far too low; even with my television volume at maximum, it's still barely audible.The famous cut of Billie with Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and Ben Webster is included. However, it's interrupted with annoying commentary and spliced up throughout the film. There are some interesting extras, but again, the video and audio quality on some of them is truly awful.I've seen far better specials about Billie on TV. Save your money and time. Give this a miss."
2,Cute but very short,"My children have enjoyed this DVD but I found it not to be a very good value - $19.99 for less than 25 mins. of video. Because I got it to expose my children to Spanish I was disappointed at the amount of songs in English vs. Spanish. Also, not much speaking going on."
2,Not what I expected,"The songs are okay; however it looked rather cheesy. I bought it to use in my classroom, but somehow it's not interesting enough (to me). Some of the songs are nice, but its really just a translated version of many english songs. Also, the fact that there weren't any Hispanic children on the DVD rather disturbed me."
4,good fun,my daughter 18mth old daughter really enjoys the songs but not rhymes maybe shes too young i like the fact they featured real pictures and puppets as they play a song she even learn some parts of the song the wheels on the bus as some parts do look low budget but the songs are some of the same songs i sang in school in mexico like de colores and que llueva im really glad there is a dvd available where i can teach my daughter to love does songs i would recommend this video
2,Not as nice as others...,"I recently got this DVD as a present... I have to say it is not as nice as I expected to be. Compared to other DVDs in Spanish we own (the A la VÃ­bora de la Mar series) this one seems to be of a much lower quality. Also, the songs and the music are not as nice, and there is too much English involved. My other complaint is that although it states that it uses traditional Hispanic nursery Rhymes, some of the songs are not-so great-translations of English nursery rhymes...If you want every video out there to introduce your baby to Spanish, buy this one too. But if you have to choose, I would definetly go for Los Colores de Rufino, 123 Cuentame un Cuento, or Do Re Mi Nino."
1,Don't bother,"This is poorly done. Nursery rhymes are not done in both languages, it has some in English and some in Spanish, but none in both languages."
1,YOU back off,"We Bratz fans can come here if we want. We want t write what we think of My Scene dolls, and we think they are ugly and stupid. Bratz dolls are better. And if your head comes off, then that is grosser, because then you would be dead. And the Bratz shoes stay on better then the My Scene shoes do. I know, I had a My Scene doll once,(I wanted to see if they were fun and boy I couldn't be more wrong) and her shoes would never stay on. Now, BRATZ dolls rock and MY SCENE dolls are terrible. And the Bratz shoes stay on better if they pop off and on. This My Scene doll is scary and ugly. You know it, I know it, the whole entire universe knows it. So get over it. This doll is scary and gross. Bratz are rock and My Scene dolls suck. Deal with it."
1,my name is C.J.,Hey my name is C.J. and im not cussing the dolls out. I am cussing out those My scene freaks. lol. I deffinatly agree with Olivia and Zoe! You guys are the best! BESTEsT FRIENDS! just read the other one i worte where they wear more slutty clothes than Bratz.*C.J.*
1,Confused...,"I dont get why they use the name Barbie. They ALWAYS use the name Barbie. Who ever made up that name........ huh, its driving me insane hearing it EVERYWHERE!!!!! Well, this My Scene doll is very ugly. I mean, PIGTAILS?????? Pigtails. What is she like 6???*Bratz Rule*-Zoe"
1,MY SCENE ARE BABIES!!,"EWW!! NOT TO BE MEAN HERE BUT MY SCENE AREN'T REALLY GOOD ROLE MODELS TO GIRLS. I MEAN IF U SEE A TEEN WEARING TWO PONY TAILS THATS STICKING OUT OF HER HEAD AND TRIES TO ACT COOL AND STUFF LIKE THAT, WHAT'S YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION?? PuKE!! BRATZ ARE SOOO MUCH BETTER THAN MY SCENE AND MY SCENE ARE JUST PLAIN COPIES O BRATZ AND BARBIE SUCKS!! SHE LOOKS LIKE A PIINK PIGGY CRYBABY IF SOMEONE SHOUTS AT HER OR WHAT AND I BET SHE WETS HER BED(SHE LOOKS LIKE THAT KIND)! BRATZ RULE MY SCENE DRULE!!"
4,barbie not so bad for girls of a younger age,"let me just say that the kids who are cursing in this review are very out of line. I would say that the bratz dolls are geared towards girls of an older age. It is absolutely ridiculous for you young girls to be fighting over toys. My daughter is 5 and absolutely loves everything barbie. I would say that my scene is appropriate for a younger girl. Don't you think that young girls read the reviews about my scene? Please stop using such criticizing language. Maybe the my scene movies are not very entertaining. But have you seen the barbie movies such as nutcracker, the magic of pegusus, ect.? They are absolutely wonderful. I enjoy watching them with my daughter. Barbie is an ongoing legacy, and has been around for decades. I would much rather have my daughter play with my scene than with a bratz doll any day, but this is only an opinion-no need to get upset."
5,Beautiful doll!,"This doll is really pretty! I would give this doll five stars! I think it is really cute and I love the swappin styles line a lot! My scene rock, and this dolls looks like a lot of fun! Infact I really want this doll. I don't get why poeple hate it so much. I mean really, the bratz head gamez are sleezy...well, all the bratz dolls are a bit to perfect and so totally popular...I don't like that. I think my scene are beautiful dolls that will always be in my life! (not bratz)"
2,I have 2 agree with nice dolls-SORRY I HAD A OPINION!!!!,"PUPPYGURL SAYS-YOU GUYS HAVE 2 STOP FIGHTING ABOUT DOLLS OK. SO WHAT IF BRATZ HAVE POP OFF FEET , THEY ARE EASIER 2 APPLY ON THEN BARBIE SHOES AND SO WHAT IF MYSCENE HAVE POP OFF HEADS, THEY DON'T DIE, THERE NOT ALIVE ,THERE PLASTIC!!!!! THEY HAVE POP HEADS BECAUSE U CAN SWITCH HAIRSTYLES. SO SHUT UP MYSCENE FANS AND SHUT UP BRATZ FANS TOO!!!!!!!!!!!! iF U LOVE MYSCENE AND BRATZ LIKE ME GOOD 4 U!!!!"
5,Can you please shut up my scene haters!!!!!!!Go away!!!!!!!!!,"I have this doll and it`s so fun to play with.I have also 4 Bratz.And Zoe.I think you are saying stupid things for Sara.Can you just stop it?Sara is nice.She is 12,just like me.*Lara*"
3,bratz and my scene rock!!!,i agree all the way about my scene and bratz dolls i love them both you do not have to compete between both of them it is not like there real people anyway there just plastic so stop fighting it is stupuid but the snap of heads is kind of stupuid
4,"These myscene dolls are not dead or alive, their just DOLLS!","I don't hate myscene or bratz. I love them both. I'm 12 years old too and I love collecting bratz and myscene.I just love the other myscene face u know the 1 with the smile and I love some bratz dolls, like wintertime wonderland jade, nighty nite cloe and tokyo a go-go jade(I love the animated face!).These myscene dolls with the heads that u can swap is freaky because u can take off the head ,but it's cool because u get 2 change their hairstyle.I like nolee better than barbie and madison. So I give it 4 stars out of 5 because u can make lot's of different looks and the reason y I didn't give it 1 more star is becuase I wish that it had the other myscene face(u know the 1 with the smile).I also have 1 question, how can this doll be educational?"
5,The Source,"This recording is of the music of Watazumi Doso, the teacher of Katsuya Yokoyama. Watazumi, who died in the late 20th century, was an authentic eccentric of the Zen Buddhist tradition. Larger than life, he has left us stories of his life that have reached mythical proportions. Watazumi's student, Katsuya Yokoyama has taught the majority of all professional shakuhachi performers in the world today. The music here is not necessarily soothing. It demands your attention. This CD is essential to anyone who wants to hear examples of a primary source of the style and techniques of today's shakuhachi players.Highly recommended."
1,very bad recording quality,"This is an odd re-issue of an old Everest LP (#3289), a recording of the gifted and idiosyncratic shakuhachi player, Watazumido-shuso. Since I own the LP, and love this man's refined, delicate playing, I was looking forward to a cleaner, noise-free CD of the same music. To my dismay, the CD sounds as if it were dubbed using a $20 microphone and a cheap noise-limiter. Sonic levels fluctuate erratically, and most of the time it sounds as if the musician were playing in a distant attic alcove. There are noticeable, regular pops on each track. Much of the sonic richness of the original recording is gone; indeed, were it not for the playing style, one might have trouble identifying the instrument! Moreover, Mr. Watazumido-Shuso's name does not appear anywhere on either the CD itself or the jewel inserts!!! The people at ""Legacy International"", who produced this disk, should be embarrassed.What a pity. I'll stay with my slightly scratchy LP."
3,Oriental Calm,"Enjoyment of this music is an acquired taste, but once that taste is acquired, it is amply rewarded. There is peacefulness and a calm inducing quality that almost borders on the effect one seeks to achieve in listening to environmental sounds. Playing this on your car CD may take 10 mph off your speed."
3,Cracked case,"I ordered this CD as a Christmas gift for my dad. As far as the songs go, I can't provide much of a review. Did find it funny to hear yodeling with lyrics in English.Only complaint is that the product was shipped in a bubble envelope and the case was cracked. The CD was not damaged."
2,1/2 the CD isn't Yodeling from the Alps,This CD should be split. The first half is folk yodeling from the South. Second half has more traditional European yodeling. Disappointed that I could pay $8 for the whole CD (incorrectly labeled) or $7 for authentic European yodeling.
3,The Alps in Texas?,"If you like authentic-sounding European Alpine yodeling, you will absolutely love half of this CD...the second half. It seems that the producers have slipped in 10 cuts of yodeling from below the Mason-Dixon line in these here United States. While I actually enjoy Western yodeling, it has no business being on a CD entitled ""Yodeling Songs of the Alps"". But the alpine yodeling you do get is marvelous! Have you heard good triple-tone yodeling lately? No? Then you really need to listen to these cuts. Most of the songs are sung in their native language with at least passable accents by their American artists. All the negativisms aside, I like this CD...but I always start at cut #11."
3,Just change the title,"The title of the CD should be changed to ""Alpine Yodeling Songs"". (Alpine - a little town in Texas about 200 miles west of Del Rio on Route 90).How can you tell? Sure the references to saddles and such are a clue, but the real dead givaway is the dulcet quavering tones of the steel guitar.Don't get me wrong, I too enjoy western yodeling. It just bothers me that the first 10 tracks are most definitely NOT from Switzerland or Germany no matter what the song titles might suggest.There are three very well done instrumentals in the remaining 12 tracks, leaving only nine real ""Yodeling Songs Of The Alps"".So, if you like to think of the glass as being half full, then you will no doubt enjoy those 12 as I do."
2,Dashed expectations,"It seemed not professional; lacked ""duets"" or female yodeling; included two schmaltzy numbers by a little girl, many of the songs were not ""authentic"" and several did not have yodeling at all such as ""Roll Out the Barrel."" Four or five songs out of 22 seemed appropriate to the title."
3,Should have Cowboy somewhere in the title,"- If your looking for an exclusively European style yodeling disc, this one is NOT it. - The first 10 cuts have words like ""wagons"" and ""cattle"" interspersed throughout. Nice cowboy yodeling if that's what you want. - The last 12 cuts are more in line with what I thought when I purchased the disc. Good stuff like oompah and Germanic vocals."
1,Yodeling Songs of the Alps,"I was greatly disappointed in this cd! Almost half of the recording is of a cowboy jodeling over his campfire in english. The music was alright but not until the middle track did the real alpine music begin. I purchased it before the music could be sampled online, and this is one of the times that I didn't luck out."
5,"If you want to ""GET IT"" GET THE BOXED SET","Stephen King Presents Kingdom Hospital: The Entire SeriesYou can get individual episode DVDs but don't waste your time. You will be disappointed, confused and windup buying the whole thing anyway. MY HUGE QUESTION AND PLEASE IF ANYONE CAN HELP ME PLEASE DO. #1 IS THERE A CD OR CD'S OF THE GREAT SOUNDTRACK AND IF NOT WHY THE ~ blank~ NOT? how GREAT WAS IT? i MAY BE STUPID ASKING THIS BUT i CAN'T REMEMBER, WHO IS THE WOMAN/ GIRL/ LADY WHO SINGS THE MORE ETHEREAL SONGS? i HAVE HEARD HER ON OTHER SHOWS BUT CANNOT TRACK DOWN HER MUSIC."
1,Stephen King is a hack.,"How about watching the original ""The Kingdom"" aka Riget done in 8 parts. Its much better, and its actually original."
5,Looked Brand New,It was great to buy a book so cheap and look brand new. Instead of going to the bookstore to buy a 113 dollar book.
2,Authors biased towards India.,"In the chapter about South Asia, the authors have written quite a lot about the ""Kashmir problem"" but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of 350,000 Kashmiri Hindus that took place in 1990. I just cannot believe that they don't know about this."
2,Nice features -- but disorganized,"It reads okay, but it is difficult to retrieve information as a resource for homework. The topics are inconsistant from chapter to chapter and are not oriented to the geographical topics defined in the Intro.The topical structure needs to be rewritten to make it a better resource."
2,Poor,"I ended up dropping this course. The book was not an easy read, but my professor made up his own answers and didn't follow the book. I could use a better geography book. This seemed outdated."
5,"Geography: Realms, Regions and Concepts, 11th edition",Everything was great. I will try to continue to use this site to order some of the many books I'll need for school. I save lots of money this way. Thanks!
5,Geography Book,"Got this book for class. Great conditon, perfect description. Great deal!!! Paid only $5. GO AMAZON!"
1,Juvenile not Juvenal,"Puerile ramblings aspiring to be satire featuring an unlikeable and unreliable protagonist. The book is gratuitously long, crude, and hackneyed. Cannot fathom why Harcourt published it. Caveat emptor."
1,No Idea What's Going On Here...,"I'll admit I haven't quite finished ""Novel"" yet, and I will complete my slog through it with grim determination, but overall I'll say I have NO idea what the author is trying to accomplish. It's not funny, it's not linear (it's not telling anything resembling a coherent story), and the characters are not believable. An amateur effort at best. Perhaps the author attended a writing school similar to the one Novel tries to run in this novel and thinks because he received some trite and elementary-level instruction on how to write, he can write.He can't. Not really. It's a lot of words strung together, but it's disjointed and ultimately uninteresting. Avoid it."
4,Good Product,"The user can definitely smell and feel the ample amounts of both aloe vera and cocoa butter, however the lotion is hard to wash off in the shower, it really does cling to the skin which is good to sooth sunburns and such but it's difficult to remove in the shower and I used a body brush which means extra time in the shower, so for that reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars."
1,Contains RETINYL PALMITATE,I should have read the label better before buying. This contains dyes and RETINYL PALMITATE (known to cause cancer)Will not buy again
5,WHAT A GIFT!,"This book has been a tremendous gift in my life as I have come to a greater self-awareness regarding my relationship with money, my environment and myself.The practical exercises have been very helpful to me, and I love to tell the story of one particular experience in which I reflected on being more welcoming towards money. I placed a vase of flowers at the entrance of my home, and the next day I received an unexpected phone call with a $2,000 scholarship offer! Remarkable and true.With its insight and humor, I have found it to be an excellent and well-appreciated gift. I highly recommend it!"
3,A little on the long side...,"There was a lot of hype for this it seemed, and it didn't really pay off. It took a good half to two thirds of the book for the actual disappearance to occur - I almost quit reading before then. I then read straight through to the end, but wasn't exactly happy with the ending.I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but the ending didn't bring as much closure as I would have liked to the story."
5,Much more complex than the title,"As Simple as Snow takes a close look at some humanly complex and complementary characters in this story of adolescent love. Recommended for those who enjoy examining typical teen life and its varied expressions. Quick and fun, engaging characters and a twist at the end make this a great read."
1,*YAWN*,"This was THE most boring book I've ever had the displeasure of reading. The author obviously tries (AND FAILS) to make a unique and complex book. This book focussed way too much on the trivial and unimportant events, and skims over the actual interesting ones. Questions that should have been answered don't, the ones that do are the ones no one cared about. It's all random and all over the place, and I'm not even sure what the plot is, besides how boring the narrators life is.Such a boring and long read. Took me forever to finish it."
3,As Simple as Snow,"This is a reading that requires some backstory. I actually read this book because it came highly recommended by John Green, and it's easy to see why. It's extremely similar to Paper Towns. Too similar for my liking. Either book is great on its own, but knowing the connection somehow cheapened both in my mind. The book has its moments of extremely insightful writing, but it did not keep my attention throughout the whole reading. The entire time, I kept drawing connections between this book and Paper Towns, and not in an enriching way, in a 'wow, this is almost identical' way. Words were brought together in powerful ways, but the story was lacking, leaving the reader with a fragmented string of beautiful thoughts."
5,One of the finest young adult (or adult) novels I know,"Beautiful, haunting (no pun intended) story that will appeal to both teens and adults, especially anyone who wonders whether it's ever possible to truly know another person, even one you feel very close to. I think of it as forming a trilogy with two of my other favorites:The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky, which is a somewhat darker story, andStargirl (Readers Circle), by Jerry Spinelli, which is a bit lighter in tone. The latter two are much better known, but Galloway's book is every bit their equal. I hope he publishes another book someday, possibly a sequel. But perhaps it's better if ASAS remains an enigmatic one-off."
4,Irrational Conclusions Are Often Used to Make a Point,This book is a social scientific study of the tendency towards irrational conclusions to make or interpret a point. I found the examples provocative but the math is beyond me.The book held my interest and I found much of it very convincing.
2,Great images but beware,"This camera, like all of the Sony DVD camcorders, creates great movies. However, a MAJOR limitation is that most commercial DVD authoring programs do not work with the proprietary MPEG-2 codec Sony uses when you download the movies using Picture Package to your computer. Also, since Sony is stingy about licensing their codec to other software vendors, it is difficult to find converstion programs out there. Roxio products will not work at all, while uLead sometimes work, but often include a timestamp that you cannot remove. Typically Sony = great hardware, lousy software. No wonder LG and Samsung are eating their lunch."
1,Bad battery charging,"DVD508's battery charging connection is a bad design, after 2-month of using, the plug is not connected well, way too loose. We have to buy a separate battery charger to solve the problem."
1,Bad Product from Sony,"Not a good product from Sony. Data is getting corrupted to often, Hissing sound from optical drive is too much and that is getting recorded onto the DVD. Its not worth the money, I am planning to get rid of this"
3,Fine Speeches by Lincoln,"This book is a collection of fine speeches by the beloved president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. Contains his most important and essential speeches which are kept pretty short because he's worried about being a man of the people. Says the presidents commands the Army and Navy. Borders on racism many times, but is kept decent without being profane."
4,A good key to understanding Lincoln,"Today Abraham Lincoln's political views are often misrepresented in many ways. Some claim he was a great forward-thinking emancipator (he originally planned to let the southern states have until 1900 to abolish slavery on an individual-state basis), while others claim he was never really interested in ending slavery at all (in fact, as early as 1838 Lincoln made it clear that he thought the only practical way of ending slavery was to contain it where it already existed, so that it would then eventually die out). These are only examples. These speeches, however, are Lincoln's definitive statement, from his own mouth, of what he did and did not stand for. They are a bit tedious to read (and would obviously work better as speeches), but anyone who is interested in Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War should read this book."
5,All the big Lincoln speeches,"For the person, from elementary school through college, studying Lincoln or the American Civil War, this book is a comprehensive guide to Lincoln's public face. From his early ""stump"" speeches through the Gettysburg Address, it's here, and very inexpensive.Like the rest of the Dover Thrift Series, the book is not printed on the best paper nor with the best binding, but the font is quite readable and the material riveting, and the book is of high enough quality construction to allow you to annotate without ruining the obverse page."
5,The Love Sessions,"The pain and emotion of lost love flows through Mel's voice on this album. ""New York State of Mind"" is simply a classic Mel Torme song. ""Send in the Clowns"" is fast, and the line, ""Losing my timing this late in my career"" seems to hint at the recent divorce that Mel was going through when this album was being recorded in London England. ""All in Love is Fair"" is sung with passion and pain! A classic"
4,"Great CD, But Previously Released!","Recorded in 1977, this CD is an excellent example of Mel's later works. Mel selected a variety of pieces from the old standard ""Bye Bye Blackbird,"" to ""New York State of Mind"" by Billy Joel.Backed by an excellent British orchestra, this CD is sure to please all generations!One thing to be careful about!!! All of the material on this new ""Super Audio CD"" was previously released on the Gryphon label under the title ""Torme - A New Album."" There is no warning on the back of the CD that it contains previously released material!!!"
5,Crystal Clear Singing,I have owned this album since 1981. My children were raised listening to Mary O'Hara and if I had to choose one collection of songs to keep and lose all the others I believe this would be my choice. It is very pleasing and I never tire of it.
4,book,"I like the author, the book has patterns to make a couple of designs mentioned in the book. I was only dissapoiinted there weren't more patterns."
5,Benni Harper's Quilt Album,I really enjoyed reading the additional stories about Benni Harper. The quilt patterns have good instructions and photos. The additional photos in the book were very interesting.
4,Great book!,The patterns are well done and simple enough for a beginner. I love all the Benni Harper mysteries and having the photos and author insight in this book was the real reason I bought it. I have been quilting for almost 20 years though-so the quilts are always the stars for me!
4,great book but one complaint,"This is a great book. I've made about 10 of the pickles and all have been very good or great except the watermelon rind pickles which maybe just aren't my thing. I recommend buying this book for the recipes. I would give it 5 stars but reduce my rating to 4 for an unusual reason - within 2 weeks of flipping through my book, the pages separated clear away from the cover/binding - a plain old poor glue job by the printer I guess. The publisher sent me a replacement copy upon request, but this copy separated body from binding just like the first - same print edition I guess. Hopefully the first edition of this great book is gone so you can buy one from a new printing with better quality control on the binding."
5,"Wow, what a great surprise!","I'm the kind of guy who loves pickles of all sorts. I'll eat a jar of bread and butter pickles, dill pickles, pickled okra, marinated mushrooms, pickled green beans, etc... The sour salty goodness just calls out my name. I'm also a decent cook. When I read some reviews of this book here on Amazon I was intrigued but a tiny bit skeptical. Wow, what a great surprise. The book is easy and fun to read and I was makng ""Fresh Dill Cucumber Pickles"" from page 37 within days. The beautiful wife was given the first taste and ate every piece of red onion and four pickles at one sitting. Sweet/sour success! I've tried several variations since and am getting more ambitious. This book has set me on delicious culinary adventure. Try it!"
4,Creative Pickling,"If you're looking to get started with basic pickles or canning, this is not the book for you. If you've mastered the basics and are looking to expand into more exotic and creative options, this is exactly what you need!From curried zucchini pickles to rhubarb pickles with caramelized onions, this book offers no end of inspired, unique ideas to tempt your taste buds and liven up you table all year round. Definitely worth the time to find and experiment with!"
5,I knew Dr. Crenshaw,"Chuck Crenshaw was a friend of mine at Parkland Hospital. We both were there at the time of the assassination. We were both residents in general surgery. He was in the trauma room with Kennedy. My only criticism with his book is in his exaggeration of his role. The facts he related were identical to those of all the other physicians who were in attendance. They were all friends of mine and I knew them well. I heard what each of them had to say moments after the ordeal. They all saw the same wounds which were described by Dr. Crenshaw. The things seen at Parkland and reported by all these doctors are clear evidence of a conspiracy. Who and why are issues not addressed. Those would require another book and a huge paradigm shift in thinking on the part of most Americans. Another good book is ""Best Evidence."" It is more thorough."
3,Credible Eye Witness Account To The JFK [...]Cover-up,"Few actual eyewitnesses to the JFK assassination and cover-up have provided us with an inside look into the happenings of that November 22, 1963. Dr. Crenshaw finally does so. His book is simply written, void of complicated medical terms and clearly illustrates the fact that the information provided by the government and certain investigative agencies was untrue. A small book, easy to read and although there is no real ""smoking gun"" here, the information provided grants credence to the conclusion millions of U.S. citizens have arrived at: President John F. Kennedy's assassinated was a high-level conspiracy and cover-up."
5,Truth or Fantasy???,"I loved this book! It was only after I had completed it that I found that there were questions concerning Dr. Crenshaw's integrity and account of the assasination. Even if some of what he writes is exaggeration, this just can't be complete fabrication and still makes me think in terms of conspiracy. Regardless, this book, if nothing else, gives a new view of the assasination and is worth reading. Entertaining!"
2,Expensive price,The same item is available at my range for less money.Blah blah blah blah blah Blah blah blah blah blah Blah blah blah blah blah
4,Its good!,"I bought this for my parents. Till now,its working fine. Not sure,what will happen in the duecourse. Hopefully,for the amount I bought,its worth it."
4,Very easy to use,"I looked at a lot of reviews before I purchased a home blood pressure monitor, and all the positive reviews of this one were right on. It is very easy to use, and has all the features I need. The cuff can slip off it inflates in the wrong position, but it's easy to fix. It appears to be accurate as well."
2,LifeSource UB-328 varied measures,"I've had my UB-328 for 4 months. The batteries are good, but I changed them anyway. Same readings. I went to my doctor today with readings taken over the last 2 weeks. Mine were all over the charts, which were kind of scary. I took my device to the doctor, but my readings were 50 points over what he used at the same time. My readings for today were 50 points over what the doctor had, using 2 different devices. I've changed the batteries, but I still get the widely varied readings. I now live in Spokane,WA. Is there a fix for this?"
2,Readings not reliable,While easy to use this product does not correlate well with manual blood pressure readings. It read high on the several people I checked.An RN
5,Very easy and convienent,"Purchased this to monitor my bp at home during end of pregnancy. It works great, easy to use. Highly recommend. Also shipped extremely fast!"
2,Not so ACCURATE,The Lifesource UB-328 is not so accurate with the results of your blood pressure and also the last number on the right side is hard to see.
2,Reading doesn't match arm cuff,"The systolic reading from the device I received was 20 points lower than the reading obtained with a calibrated arm cuff. The diastolic reading usually matched. Other than that, it is a great device. I returned it."
4,UB-328 wrist auto infalte-NOT FOR CHILD USE,hello for a medium to larger adult this takes a good Blood pressure with in a couple of numbers.when compaired to a RN Hand pumped unit.The ONE problem we used it on my SMALL wrist.it wase Horrabley off.I do wish they had informed us BETTER about Optimal wrist size.Honestly it did say for wrists between X.X inches & X.X inches.in fine print in the direction.It was not clearly stated.So Please besure who your grtting for is raitted for.it does work well and has a good memory.
2,Innaccurate & Inconsistent,"I got this when my mother's doctor said she should be checking her blood pressure at home. We tried if for about 3 weeks, and after getting wildly inconsistent results, we took it to the doctor's office to compare with their meters, and make sure we were using it right. The first time it varied more than 20% above the doctor's reading; the second time, almost 20% below! The doctor said wrist monitors are usually not as accurate, and recommended we return this and get one used on the upper arm, like his. I just wish he'd said so in the first place. Anyway, we returned this and got a HoMedics BPA-200, and so far it appears to be more consistent, with less than 8% variance from the doctor's meter. Of course it cost more."
2,So much for research..,"Well, after much research on Amazon and other sites, I finally decided on this particular model. What a waste of time and shipping costs! It was a piece of junk. There was nothing I could do or any way I could wear it that would give accurate results. I would take my bp 3 times and get 3 wildly different readings. I sent it back right away and was given prompt service and a refund for the item. At least the retailer was great to work with, even though the product stinks."
1,Unreliable,"I am a young slender woman with skinny wrists, maybe that is the cause of the problem I have with this device. I have unstable blood pressure and this device has alot of difficulty reading my BP. I get alot of Err 1 or Err 2 when trying to get a reading even though I am perfectly still. When it actually CAN get a reading it is usually 10 points higher than my doctor's monitors. This is with new batteries and with the device strapped on as instructed.I do not recommend it if your BP is constantly high and you keep a close eye on it. There are times I suddenly get a headache and when I try to get a reading the machine CONSTANTLY fails over and over again, on either hand, strapped tight or loose, doesnt seem to make a difference."
2,Blood Pressure Readings Way Off,My husband and I bought this because he has episodes of arrythmia and we wanted to know what his B/P and pulse rates were during an episode. We took the unit to our Drs. office and compared the B/P readings on the unit with what the RN got and the unit was WAY off. If the unit was correct he would have had a major stroke and died..the numbers were that high. I haven't checked to see if there is a way to calibrate the unit so that it is correct so I haven't given up on it as yet. The pulse readings are right on the money each time so at least at this point it is good for that.
4,Functional and inexpensive,"Nothing fancy about this blood pressure monitor. But, it's easy to use and its readings seem consistent with what my doctor gets. I was concerned about the size because I read a review indicating that it would not fit a large wrist. My wrist is a solid 7 inches and it works fine."
5,Good Deal,I have found the LifeSource wrist blood pressure monitor to a good quality product and extremely accurate. Great price. I would recommend to anyone.
4,Good gift for a teenager,I enyoyed this book and the basic logic behind it. It is writen in a very simple way and even a 12 year old as the author says should be able to understand it. But even adults specially christian religious ones should read it. Speacially those looking for some basic answers on why many of us non-believers think the way we do without having to read a voluminous philosophical book. Then it would be up to them to seek a more comprehensive book
1,Not what I expected,Really not what I expected I can use this for nothing really and is really ugly! The buckle is huge and is horrible!
2,difficult for me to put on.,Very difficult for me to put on. Belt was very stiff. I actually cut my finger on the edge while putting it on.
2,Stiff and doesn't latch well.,"While I think the durability is probably good and it is certainly sized big enough for a 50"" waist, the belt nylon is really stiff and the latch has not positive engagement.It has a friction buckle, which I knew, but most friction buckles have a sort of pivot point where there is a clear lock-in. This one does not, or if it does, the nylon is so stiff it doesn't work like it should. Since it is only a single stage friction buckle it is also easy to snag the buckle and pop it right open, more so because the stiff nylon doesn't really allow the buckle to seat all the way flush.Doesn't really fit well at all with any sort of holster / high activity belt. Really disappointing for an Uncle Mike's item. They are usually at least decent. Would not buy again. I should give it 1 star but it gets two because it is very inexpensive and I think the durability would be quite good."
4,The Best,"If you already know the basics and want to be functional, this is the course for you. It is only audio CD's, but that is what I prefer so I can do this while I'm driving. You can do this on the computer but it takes focus and time. You will not get this in a few days or even a few weeks, this is many months worth of learning for most folks. I have about all the courses you can find and I think this is the best and most comprehensive. If I could go back and just buy one, this would be it."
4,CD was good!!!,The product was excellent...the only reason I didn't give a 5 is because I waited 2 weeks to get it which wasn't the seller's fault. The seller did tracking and stayed present throughout the process.-John
1,Not what I expected,I have spent a bit of time in the Bahamas and the West Indies and I was hoping to hear that same steel drum island music. This is terrible compared to others I have heard.
3,maybe good for managers of big software projects,"I bought this book because I am interested in learning more about rewriting algorithms and in representation and logical analysis of software. This book did not help me, but maybe it would be helpful to those who need to manage teams of developers of large software projects."
4,Construction Superintendent's Operations Manual,Packed of useful informationGood reference book.Saves lots of time while on construction site.
5,Very influential in my thinking about ethics and education,"Caring is a challenging book to read, because Noddings bases her ethical philosophy on an alternative approach to ethics than we are used to seeing. She argues that the relation between a one-caring and a cared-for should be the focus of how we think about right and wrong. As a fairly conservative and religious person, I find that I am uncomfortable at times with how the book is written. However, I think that has more to do with the examples that Noddings uses rather than the theory itself. Despite her wishing to distance herself from a God, I find her ethical theory to be evocative of the Gospels. If readers accept Noddings on her own terms, I think they will find her theory very different and refreshing. I've read the book again now after a few years and even though it can be difficult to read, I think it's very helpful for educators."
1,Tedious and poorly written,The author comes across as angry and argumentative throughout the book. Her repeated definitions are tedious and she spends more time trying to create new words than proposing a theory. Terrible.
4,The Weedless Widow,"I ordered a new copy of The Weedless Widow to complete the series of books by Deborah Morgan. The set of books were to be used in a raffle benefitting the Lake Isabella, CA Animal Shelter at a Sisters on the Fly event in Kernville, CA. The only problem with the copy of the book was that it had a wide black line across one end of the book that looked like it came from a Magic Marker. The winner of the raffle didn't mind at all about the mark and she is looking forward to reading the series. She is such a sweetheart that I am planniing to ask to borrow the series so that I can read them, too. Shipping service was great with Amazon and I received the book within a week of ordering it."
2,nothing to do with Andes,"I am a big fan of Andean music.Music on this CD is nice but has nothing to do with the Andes, it is more Paraguaian..."
5,as moving as the song,"I'm thrilled to see the books that are coming out that are tied to songs that move us. This book is wonderful and I've read it a dozen times at least. As a songwriter, I love to read books that expand upon songs. Live Like You Were Dying has two books out that are also wonderful. One is a lyric book with inspirational thoughts about life. The other one is a novel that expands upon the story inside the song. Please keep these types of books coming! They make listening to the song more meaningful."
5,Really Great Song and Book,"My mom got this book for me at my 5th grade graduation and it was really sweet, and i liked it. A few days ago i was sitting in my room andi opened it to read it again, and it was great. This is the cutest gift ever and you should buy it."
5,Inspirational!!!,This was a perfect timing gift. I needed to feel small standing beside to the ocean. It took a long time to read only because the tears were slowing me down. This is a great gift to anyone who just needs a reason to smile. I truly love it!
4,Way too mushy and sentimental,"This book contains the lyrics to the song, ""I hope you dance"", along with some poetry to go along with it and a CD of the song. I thought it was too mushy and sentimential. But since my 11-year-old daughter liked the song, I got her the book for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. Despite all the mushiness, it does have some good messages for everyone."
3,Missing the CD with song by Lee Ann Womack,I received one of these book and CD as a gift. When I ordered I thought it included the CD.
3,No CD,"The book is good, like the one I used before. But I failed to note in the ad that there was no CD. The music is lost. Next time I will be more careful. The add should have had a note."
5,I'd give it 10 stars if they'd let me...,"I bought two of these books, one for each of my daughters (10 yrs and 12 yrs) because I told them a year ago that the song was a dedication from me to them and when I found the book, I couldn't believe it. I cried while I was ordering them because I knew how special it would be to them.I just received the books and it took me a long time to read it because I couldn't see the words through my tears. This book is so beautiful and inspirational. I know my daughters will love it and I pray they will live by it.To Lee Ann Womack, Mark Sanders and Tia Sellers... Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for creating something so beautiful for me to share with my two beautiful daughters!"
5,Everything I wanted to say.,"Have you ever walked through a store and had something catch your eye and you don't know why, but you pick it up? I don't know why I picked up this book. But I did and started reading. I found myself standing in the middle of Kmart, thinking of my daughter and crying like a baby. She had recently separated from her husband and this book/song said exactly what I have always wanted for her. I bought it and sent it to her and she cried too.I had heard the song before, but never listened to the words. I am grateful that someone could put into words the exact things that I need to convey to my daughter."
2,Readers digest version of LI history,"Not bad, but typical Newsday style- a brief version. History Lite would be a good term for it."
2,Just Better Than Nothing,"We took this to Italy with our Nuvi 780. It's just better than nothing if you are in Italy. Just plugged this one in the SD slot and the system included this map. No password; no setup needed. However, it's content is quite questionable. We found that chunks of database for important cities and major roads are missing. For example, it didn't have a four lane road (actually six-lane if you include the side streets) that had major businesses including several three star hotels and a Toyota Dealer. Also, beware that it keeps routing through ZTL (Zone Traffic Restriction), and if you go through ZTL expect to pay 150-300 Euros as fine. It didn't have several other major roads. POI also seemed incomplete. It appeared as if programmers released this in a hurry hoping (taking very high risk) that people would not travel through the portion of the map which were not completed. In essence, very poor map."
2,outdated,I bought this for a trip to italy and wish i didnt waste the money. The maps were outdated. It tried sending us on roads that didnt exist and didnt have many of the paved public roads that we were driving on.
3,ÎÎµÎ½ ÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎ¹&#940;Î¶ÎµÎ¹,"&#904;Î´ÏÏÎ± Î±ÏÏ&#972; ÏÎ¿ 3 Î±ÏÏ&#941;ÏÏÎ½, Î³Î¹Î±Ï&#943; Î´ÎµÎ½ Î¾&#941;ÏÏ Î±Î½ Î±ÏÏ&#972; Î´Î¿ÏÎ»Îµ&#973;ÎµÎ¹, Î³Î¹Î±Ï&#943; Î´ÎµÎ½ ÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎ¹&#940;Î¶ÎµÎ¹ ÏÎµ Garmin Î¼Î¿Ï. ÎÎ±Îº&#940;ÏÎ¹ Î½Î± &#941;ÎºÎ±Î½Î±."
4,garmin italy map,"The Garmin was hugely helpful. I don't know how anyone could navigate the country without a GPS! But there were certain cities, smaller ones, that it did not know its way around very well. It directed us to go down several one-way streets the wrong way... And also landed us in the middle of a ""restricted traffic"" area which may land us a ticket for $150 Euros if they caught our license plate on the video cameras. Ouch!!"
3,Navigating Rome,It would get confuse sometime about a location. I guess some roads are tiny...but shouldn't a navigator know how to navigate?
1,Did not work very well,"I bought the maps of Italy and Greece for a trip to Italy. It was close to useless.in Florence. It would tell us to turn on a street and when we turned, it say recalculating iike we had turned at the wrong street. Several times it ran us in a circle and we would come out where we had started. In Sicily it was the same thing. There were times when it worked but by that time we did not trust it. Luckily we had hard copy maps that got us out trouble. Overall it was a waste of money. I think next time I would I would rent a car with the GPS included instead of using my own."
1,No Directions,"This SD Card doesn't work, can't be unlocked, and came with no documentation. Worst product that I have purchased on Amazon so far."
1,No signal in Rome,"I installed the Garmin ""City Navigator Europe NT"" in my Garmin Nuvi 1260T. It appeared to be working properly, and provided maps of Rome, Venice and Ischia (a small island off Naples near Capri). I planned to use it walking around the streets. However, it was useless in Rome and Venice because I never got satellite reception. I did get satellite reception in Ischia. In Rome and Venice, where there are many narrow streets with buildings to block reception, I tried the navigator several times in piazzas that had fairly open access to the sky. It found no satellites on either narrow streets or open piazzas. My 1260T locks on to satellites in New Jersey, where I live, very quickly, much more quickly than 2 my older units (a Garmin Nuvi 250 and a Tom Tom). For me, the Garmin ""City Navigator Europe NT"" was a complete waste of money."
1,Big Disappointment,"Seemed to work fine for about three days... that's not much good if you are in Italy for three weeks! I thought maybe the Garmin unit it was plugged into had conked out on me. But, when we returned to the states, the unit worked great. I have no idea what's wrong with the card, I just know I wasted my money. COMMENT ADDED 8/4/2012: Returned the defective card to Amazon for credit. I did not recieve a full refund, but I am satisfied with their handling of the situation. It was still a big disappointment not to have a working Garmin while we were in Italy as it was a once in a lifetime trip."
1,Honesty in Advertising,"Take this review with a grain of salt, but when I googled ""garmin 010-10691-05"", a page popped up indicating this map is from Nov 2005. Hey, it's 2012 and in the realm of GPS maps this is OLD. Under no circumstances should outdated maps such as these be advertised for sale without a clear indicator of age. How outdated it is? Depends on how many changes have taken place since 2005. Could it still be usable? Yes it could. Since you can purchase this map new directly from Garmin for about $20 more, it does not seem to be a bargain. Could I be wrong about the age? It's possible, but check it out before purchase."
2,Surprisingly lacking,"Garmin City Navigator for Detailed Maps of Italy and Greece (microSD/SD Card)We recently used this in Italy. Although it often chose a reasonable (but not the best) route, occasionally it sent us through circuitous routes. On one occasion, it sent us on a 25 mile back-roads route when we were 5 miles away by a direct route. Never use this without first plotting a route on a map. It also seemed to lack street details for Florence-- I have an older Garmin Nuvi with built in Europe map which worked much better than the add-on card."
1,Not for Venice,"Prior to leaving for Venice I purchased the sd card recommended by Garmin (Italy including Venice). If Venice is you're vacation, don't buy this card. We had a wonderful time in Venice and the surrounding islands but this product was of no value. Venice is a complex of tall buildings and narrow walkways and canals. The satellite apparently couldn't determine where we were or where we were going. If you're leaving Venice to visit a nearby town, then by all means, this will prove helpful. If however, it's ""Venice only"" then save your money. I want to make it clear, I'm not saying it is of limited value in Venice, I'm saying it is of NO value in Venice. BTW...Venice is navigable without any GPS device. You can walk absolutely anywhere without difficulty. There is very little crime and there is a police presence. By all means, bring/buy a tourist map....but you won't need a GPS."
1,Garmin card for Italy and Greece,in just three little words - IT DIDN'T WORK!!!!!!Said I was in the middle of a field - was on a major highway going south from Rome.AND - the Garmin would NOT charge in the Peugeot 5000 we had. I returned it and received my money back! CanNOT tell you HOW disappointed I was. Nearly ruined the entire trip!
3,Italy GPS works fine (except when it doesn't),"Used the Italy maps on the mainland and Sardinia for a couple of weeks. It worked fine in most situations, although the GPS Lady had a tendency to make blunders, occasionally big ones. So we had up to three opinions: road signs, the GPS, and my wife trying to read read maps -- and there was no clear winner. The GPS was weaker in Sardinia and on secondary roads. So you should not rely on it exclusively; but overall it was well worth the expense."
5,Garmin for Italy,I am hopeful that this will help in my travels to Italy this summer. I plugged in the name of the village I will be staying in but it was unknown to the Garmin so I will try by address next and hopefully it will recognize it.
4,Garmin Maps Italy,"Maps worked well in most places. We had some problems in Venice and Rome, but other than that, in general all was good."
2,desperatly in need of an update,"Just returned from a trip to Tuscany and Sicily, where we used this map in our Nuvi.While it was okay for the older roads, any newly constructed roads and of course numerous detours caused us to rely on other methods(maps, signs, and dead reckoning) which unfortunately happened far too often.Garmin should have done a much better job of keeping this map updated. As an example, while in Sicily the GPS directed us to drive down a secondary State road, which ended up at a dead end (closed) that was obviously closed for quite a while. The paint on the pavement was gone and the guardrail blocking the road had very large tall weeds growing up around it. This happened several times during our travels.Until a good update happens, I would not recommend spending any money on this map."
3,No Information,"I just received this product and it took 3 hours to get it to work on a 60csx. The manual consists of 1 3""x 3"" page in English of which 1/3 is a warning and 1/3 is a legal disclaimer.I'm still in the States but from what I can see the maps are very good, with plenty of useful POI's. This chip did not work with Garmin Mapsource or Garmin Map installer. Insert the chip into the unit and figure it out from there. Meaning as far as I can tell, no PC tie in.In my opinion Garmin makes the best mapping product on the market. Which is a shame because they are consistently overpriced with minimal support. It takes hours on line to see how useful their products can be. Which can be a little scary when you can't get on line."
4,Italy GPS SIM Card,Very Good and Accurate. Up to date with the most recent in roadways and navigation.No problem in 'booting' up in another country to get it to work. Smooth transition from US to Italy. BETTER DIRECTIONS THAN USING THE LOCALS !!
5,Speed Swivel,Fast & works well with Everlast speed platform. I did not try the swivel that came with the platform - so do not have a comparison between standard & speed.
1,"Not as pictured twice in a row - I give up, Amazon","The Everlast Professional Swivel pictured in the item description is a good piece of equipment - I have used it in a gym. I noticed Amazon had a good price on it, so I purchased one a couple of months ago - an item different than the picture arrived. I returned that one, and tried again. Same result.I'll soon be returning this one, too - it's an inferior piece of...well, equipment. In Amazon's defense, it looks like Everlast calls the inferior product a ""Professional Swivel,"" and they may have changed the product, but what one sees should be what one gets.Come on, Amazon, you can do better."
3,Average Quality,"It really is amazing how pathetic the quality of most Everlast products is today. If you are new to boxing and looking for quality equipment, try Cleto Reyes. From my experience, Everlast manufactures stuff with the kind of consumer in mind that will hang a heavy bag in his garage for decoration purposes only. I'm sure they have some professional line, but that's not what you find on Amazon or in retail store near you.Addressing the quality of this speedbag swivel specifically, it's ok, mine arrived defective and I had to fix it myself, but it seems to be working now."
4,Everlast Pro Swivel,"I purchased the low end speed bag set.The set came with the ball and D-ring swivel.Although it worked, the speed and rhythm I'm accustom to was not obtainable.With the pro swivel, the speed and rhythm keeps my interest.If your not mechanically inclined the cotter pin connection can pose a problem.Honestly if your thinking about speed bag training you'll need the ""Pro- Swivel"".Great item!"
4,Everlast Professional Swivel,"Our speed bag platform came with the standard cheap Everlast swivel with the ""s"" hook and white plastic bearing. The original swivel is garbage at best, as the bag unscrews itself immediately making use of the product impossible. It is shameful that Everlast manufactures the plastic swivel. We just upgraded the swivel to the Everlast Professional. The difference is like night and day. We can now use the speed bag for its intended purpose. One slight problem is the difficulty of changing bags as it attaches by a bicycle type chain link. (Instructions not included with product)."
1,"Swivel # 4444 is not worth buying if you plan to ""work"" speedbag","I and the Venice beach speed bag sandbox crew here in LA, Calif, have gone through at least 8 of these swivels! I do not recommend these swivels because they are not made to withstand the punishment you can give them! The swivels break from the brackets, BREAK from the bracket! due to the punishment we/you give them! These are supposed to be at a Professional Level III ""Powder Coated Steel For Superior Durability"" and you figure made to last, on the contrary, these have lasted an average of 3 months! We have 6 speedbag swivels at Venice Muscle beach and of this moment two are broken and one was replaced just one month ago! Model #4444 is not worth paying for because down the line you're going to have to replace it!"
3,Got jipped on the screws!,"Bought this for my sister for Christmas last year. Just recently got around to putting it up for her. There are no instructions on how to get the bag on, so I guess you're supposed to just know how to put it on and not break it. Also, the product description says that you get the screw for mounting but they were not included in mine. So had to go to the hardware store twice to figure out which screws would work best. Whew...that was a workout just putting the darn thing together. However, it seems to be working...keep your fingers crossed."
5,"Brilliant, challenging, and wonderful","This book really cannot be praised too highly. Pieper's discussion is more deep and insightful than any psychology text I've seen, and he's not even trying to do psychology.He uses traditional and technical words (like ""sloth""), but this is necessary to distinguish shades of moods, emotions, and actions. I used to think of ""slothful"" as synonymous with ""laziness"" -- but this book made me realize what a huge difference there was. You could work hard every day, but if deep inside you know you could do great things, and you simply don't bother to do them, then you are guilty of sloth. Many Christians (and non-Christians) that I know, including myself, will recognize this as a part of their lives.And that's just from one paragraph of ""Hope"", the least powerful of these three essays!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I love Stephen Foster's songs. This CD left out a few of his familiar songs, but had a few that were not composed by him. Therefore the title is misleading. Although the choir was fine, I would like it better if they interpreted songs differently, reflecting characteristics of each song. Also I consider not having lyrics included in the CD a glaring omission."
3,not what I was looking for,I had to return it. I'm waiting for the refund. There has been no acknowledgment of the return and they did not reply to emails.
3,vw but barely,"If you own a volkswagen golf/jetta A3 with rear discs then this tool does not fit as it is, you must remove 2 extra bumps that it comes with and then yes it will fit. For the cost of this tool I cant really complain. It is not bad at all for 35 dollars less than the actual vw tool."
1,Extremely poor model,"The fit, detail, and construction of this model is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. It would take a model builder of extreme ability to make anything decent out of this."
2,New fighter plane? Not hardly!,"Don't let the text in the item description fool you... this is no ""new fighter plane""... the so-called ""F-19 Stealth"" was a hypothetical design by Testors model company back in the 1980s, before the F-117 was officially announced. Testors wanted to make a model based on rumors of a ""top secret stealth plane"", and this is what their designers came up with. It's more of a sci-fi plane than anything else."
2,The Sony version the Boogey Man is terrible.,"This allegedly new digitally re-mastered version of 1980s ""The Boogey Man"" has replaced the original opening credits with computer generated, generic white lettering. And the video image is probably not as good as the original Anchor Bay release. The Anchor Bay version is still around so buy that one instead."
3,NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!,"Although, The Boogeyman is worth watching and very entertaining for what it is, I can't help but feel ripped off by the movie on the other side of the disc titled Return of the Boogeyman. Basically, a psychic woman narrates the original movie for you claiming that she's having nightmares about it. It's like watching the original movie with some annoying commentator giving you a play by play of what you have already seen. Not to mention, whoever put this movie together also stole a scene from another movie called Brainwaves (the tub scene where the woman is electrocuted by the radio).Return of the Boogeyman is boring, a waste of time. A waste of money if you buy it. View at your own risk. You were warned.;-)"
4,A classic super-natural slasher film !,"If your looking for a unique old 80's horror classic that will bring you right back to your childhood hayday of renting every horror title with cool/scary cover art from your local mama & papa's video store. Then Ulli Lommel's ""THE BOOGEYMAN"" is just the classic your looking for!"
2,Boogeyman,"This was a total waste of time. It reminded me of ""Halloween"" at many points but beyond that it was extremely poor acting, no plot, and not at all scarey. Don't waste your time watching this."
1,The Bologna-man,"""Somethings should stay dead"" like this horrible piece of 80's slasher/ghost story movie with the very untalented Suzanna Love(director Ulli Lommel wife) and the late great John Carradine in one of those ""I need the money"" roles, and tells the story of a brother and sister who see their mother beat by a lover and the son kills him as the sister watches in a mirror. Years later the grown children find the mirror and after it is broken, the pieces still have the tint of murder in them and a round of gory murders follow. Pure cheese and trash from the man who would go on to give us ""The Green River Killer"" and other bottom of the rung ""Movies""PURE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great read.,"By reading this book, you'll learn all about the American Civil War from a Union Irishman's point of view and discover what the war meant to him. So many Irishmen fought for the U.S.A. because they loved that it was a free nation, and they longed to prove to people that they belonged there, and finally they saw the war as a chance to earn the right to call themselves Americans.My favorite part in this book was a story McCarter told about a foraging expedition he and his friends went on where they went into a home looking for food and were actually locked inside a room, and captured by a southern family. It gets interesting. Check it out if you'd like to know what happens!"
1,Don't buy!,Very bad knife. it broke after 4 months!!!!J.A. Henckels International Forged Synergy 7-Inch Hollow Edge Santoku is the wrost knife i had.
2,Only semi granton edge,"This knife has grantons (hollow spots) ground on only one side of the blade -- the side that shows in the packaging. The flat side sticks like any non-granton blade. The blade is also a bit thick for a santoku, more like a 7-inch forged chefs knife."
3,Good Knife for Lt. Handers,Very sharp knife with a nice large handle which I like. Problem is that the hollow edge is on only one side and is on the Lt. side which makes it useless if you are Rt. Handed. Overall the knife is sturdy and comfortable for my large hands. I don't feel like I have to rest my fingers ontop of the blade at and the the handle curves nicely for a comfortable grip.
2,Formula has changed.,"Carlson's formula for these appears to have changed since I bought them earlier in the year (~March 2010). Label no longer says the Vitamin A & Vitamin D are ""(from cod liver oil)"", and the amounts of them are higher. This indicates to me they are supplementing artificial vitamins into the cod liver oil. This degrades the nutritional value. I returned mine back to Amazon."
1,Contains synthetic Vitamin A and D!,"This product claims the vitamin A and D are from Cod Liver Oil but listed in the ""other ingredients"" are retinyl palmitate and cholecalciferol...which are NOT from cod liver oil. I am very disappointed in this deceptive product."
3,So so,"The label states:!000 mg. Lovely. Isn't it ?But,only 90 mg. of EPA and 120 mg.of DHA.The minimum of what counts.Enjoy"
5,gene simmons season 5,execellent season that show the intimate side and fun by gene and family I will recomendet with a lot of hours of funs and excellent extras
4,not complete,"This dvd of season 5 is not complete. The missing episodes are on season 6, part 1 dvd set. I didn't notice it was missing anything till I watched season 6, part 1 dvd set."
5,Family jewels rocks!!,This DVD is awesome. The whole series is definitely worth watching. I never knew that he was so smart and motivated.
2,lack of passion,"I know: A history book is not meant to be a page turner. But this book is written in such a dry and unemotional way that the reader wonders why he was originally interested in that region at all. It mainly consist of a compressed recounting of historical events the author has read about somewhere else. The book may be helpful for the fist year history student, but for the 'layman' who has a general interest in the region and its history, this book isn't worth buying. Sorry!"
2,okay harmonica - faulty holes,"Good for beginnners, but leaks a lot of air and mine is very difficult to get a good clear draw on 8 and 9.Maybe I've got a bad one, but not impressed."
3,"what ""good"" for a beginer means","as a sesoned player i bought this harmonica because i needed a cheapo and i was feeling impulsive. what i like: the muddy grungy sound of it . what i dont like: rather hard to get a acurate bend (especialy on the three hole), the muddyness really gives it a flat sound aand as mentioned it does have a problem with leaking air. what good for beginers isalmost anything. as a beginer you are stiill finding the ""sound"" you like the tone and style whatever. im having a really hard time saying good things about this harp but for a beginer without much say so in how the like their harmonica this or my first harmonica : Hohner Blues Band Harmonica-10 Hole, Key of C will do."
5,Reserve battery,"I use this holder with 3 CR123 non-rechargeable batteries as an emergency spare in case my 2 rechargeable batteries are flat. Come in handy a couple of times over the last 2 years and still working with the original 3 CR123's. Cheap insurance if you forget to charge your batteries sometimes. Picked up 10 CR123 online for $10, don't pay $5 each in a retail shop unless you really have to."
5,Last Chance,This is the pack to take along and hopefully never have to use. CR123 batteries have a shelf life of like 10 years. They are also available in most drug stores. Use your normal rechargeable but when you have to get the pictures and the battery is dead this devise will save the day.
2,Rough Handles,"Nice hollow-ground blade and full tang, but the wooden handles were rough and unfinished. Has Chicago Cutlery never heard of sandpaper? Gave them to my son."
1,Really bad knife set... Don't buy,"We bought this, and they couldn't cut through butter... Really bad.....Returned them the next day....Don't buy... Just bought a saber set.. awesome. The best...Spend alittle more, and get the best..."
3,Big knife missing,"All I expected was my order to be complete. I think perhaps this was a return item that no one checked to make sure all knives were in the box. Not worth the trouble to send it back, however, I will not trust J. A. Henckels International again. I already complained and heard nothing back.Sue in Denver, CO"
2,"Sharp, but NOT Stainless Steel!!","I got these knives two months ago. I wanted to buy good knives so I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and found these knives and saw they were stainless steel. After doing research, I saw they were cheaper on Amazon so I bought them. I received them and they seemed to work fine. After a few washes in the dish washer, I noticed rust spots on one of the knives. I thought it was food stuck on them so I washed them again, but the spots didn't go away. As time went on, I notices all the knives had started to have rust spots. Stainless Steel doesn't get rusty. On the knives it SAYS Stainless Steel, but I can't see why thy would get rusty if that was true. Don't spend the money on these knives... If you want to spend decent money on good knives, better buy them in a store that you can return them to. And that's saying something because I buy literally EVERYTHING from Amazon. What a waste of money..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,These knives are terrible! They started rusting on day 2 after we started using them and we hand-wash them too! Very very disappointing product... Don't waste your money on this poor quality and immediately rusting ripoff!
1,Not a quality knife.,"If you're anything like the average American using the one-four knives a week and tossing them in the dishwasher to get washed they instantly (first wash) start having rust spots.Best guess is they use an extremely cheap stainless steel material that is not the quality one would normally expect with Henckels knives.Personally I have the older set of knives that I had before this set that I still prefer to use for dinner and use this set primarily for the larger knives in the block, but all of them are embarrassing to use with company.Update: It has been about 6 months since purchase, each of the blades are showing signs of rust. The block might be the best thing from the kit, plenty of space and solid resin product it seems (doubt it's wood).The handles have a good feel and are comfortable to hold, but I could not in good faith suggest this product to anyone.Cheap, Cheap, Cheap...."
1,Slow Down Don't Purchase,Super thin and serated. Never been more disapointed with purchase. You can bend blades with hands. I bought 200.00 set calphalon contemporary knifes no comparison not even clothes it was like comparing hugo to mercedies. If You want good Knife buy calphalon make sure it says german steel carbon no stainless. Amazon made it right though I am very pleased with Amazon.
3,Maybe I was mistaken,"Good if you like serrated blades. I must have missed that part in the description of the product. Now that I have them, I'll use them, but would have chosen otherwise if not for my own ignorance."
2,"Not great, but some use","Not a great helping book for writing biology research papers. I prefer ""A short guide to writing about biology,"" by Jan A. Pachnik. Much better examples and tips for ideal writing methods. This book by Knisely recommends writing structure with poor usage and voice. Doesn't promote ease of reading or how to organize your paper initially. Go with the Pachnik book and you'll write better papers. I also recommend visiting your writing center if your school has one. They can help."
5,Super sharp and handy,"I love this knife!!!! I don't even put it away - I'm using it all the time. It's super sharp and I've had it for a few months and it's still as sharp as the first day I used it. It's a smaller knife and fits perfectly into the hand for quick paring, slicing, etc. So very handy."
5,constantly cooking,"this knife completes my block and I love it for cutting small things. It is very sharp and flexible enough to make curved cuts easily, like when you're removing seeds from an apple slice. Indespensible!"
4,Nice little knife,"I got this on sale as one of the lightning deals and it is great. I use this size all the time for cutting fruits, potatoes or anything small. My last smaller knife I broke by trying to separate some partially frozen meat so the sale on this came at a perfect time. Works just as great as the expensive knives for a much better price. Thanks Amazon."
2,Inspector sneezed as this one went by,"Had high hopes as this knife had great reviews, as the title says mine was a less than stellar specimen.The ""hollows"" on one side were not straight and ran down into the edge, to add insult to injury, that edge also ran off near the tipresulting in just one side having an edge the last 1/2 inch near the tip. Both obvious flaws and visible the moment you picked up the knife.So I can only assume no one picked up the knife before packaging. MyVictorinox 47508 3-1/4-Inch Paring Knifeat a third the price which I purchased after the return are a much better value."
4,Israeli Folk dances and songs,"Great Cd I love all the Israeli songs. As an Israeli dance teacher, I found new version of musice to teach Israeli Dancing. Recomend getting it. Good qualityDalya in San Diego[...]"
2,"Authentic Yes, Good No","While the sound clips made this CD sound like a good choice for passing along tradition to the kids in the car, it sounds like it was a dcopy of a copy of a copy or very poorly recorded as an orignal. The production quality was low so after a couple of listens, this disc was relegated to the junk pile."
5,Great music!,"My mom played this for me a few years ago, and I listened to it a lot until I lost the disc. Finally I found it again, heh heh. Anyway, I really love this CD. The songs are all really pretty, and it all sounds really natural. I mean, they don't have weird synthesized stuff or anything, haha. It almost reminds me of the first pioneers in Israel. ^^ Buy this CD! I heart it."
3,"Too much music, not enough song","Hava Nagila was about the only good song on this CD in my opinion. Most of the tracks are music tracks that sound very much like the one before it. I guess that's okay if that is what you were looking for, but I was hoping for more songs with words. I played it once and tossed it in a storage box (my garage sale box)."
2,Challenging to figure out,"Bought this for my daughters 7 birthday, very hard to figure out...No good directions with software either.....Gets very discouraging, especially with your daughter sitting beside you wanting to play and you just cant get this game to work, very slow going......"
2,boring,"My girls loved the movie and have a variety of computer games, but this one is definitely not a favorite. It's boring, tedious and repetitive. My girls would choose any of their Barbie games or I Spy games over this any day."
1,Save your $,No hint book made and boy do you need one. We got through the relentless nagging from Rain and through the town but after that we where stuck and THQ offers NO suport. None!
5,My Girls Love It,My 6 and 4 yr old girls love this game and beg to play it every day. They got fed up asking me to teach them how to play it and spent the several hours required to learn it themselves. I admire their determination--I gave up after about 10 minutes. The documentation is poor and the play is not obvious. I think the game appeals to them for several reasons. 1) they love horses and the Spirit movie. 2) the game is not `scary' (no monsters). 3) there is a lot of freedom to explore. 4) there is an emphasis on helping others. I had no installation issues on Windows XP.
3,Pretty Cool,"Spirit and his herd were captured by rustlers! Over time, Spirit's herd had been sold to other people and all that was left were two horses. Spirit and an old gray horse. Catch the rabbit and he'll give you a carrot, win a race with the eagle and earn a feather, do good deeds and save your herd!If this game were a bit longer or more difficult, it would have been much better. I beat it in less than 1 hour! Also, as soon as you beat it, there is nothing to do except run around the place and talk to your herd."
1,Defective recording--BEWARE!,"What would have been an otherwise exciting and stirring recording recalling all the pomp and circumstance of the French Military is completely ruined by loud crackling and popping in some of the tracks. In fact, the first time I listened to this CD (full of excited anticipation), I was in my car travelling down the interstate behind a truck which I thought was throwing gravel up on my windshield. It wasn't--it was the CD. I firmly believe that Amazon.com should contact the producer of this recording and demand that it be done over properly."
1,The absolute worst CD ever.,DO NOT BUY.This is a waste of money. It must have been recorded with a paper bag held over a single microphone. Absolute garbage.Amazon should be ashamed of selling this.
4,"Music is great, recording is poor...","All the recording quality complaints from others are true. This CD plays OK with $30 boombox, but not on a serious Hi-Fi. But the music is really better than I thought. I was thinking French guys are good at love songs, which is absolutely true, but their marching music is even better than the German ones I just got (from the same company called Legacy International).How bad is the recording? It seems like the music was played from LP, taped in a dark room, stored for 5 years, and then dumped on CD...How good is the music? I still rate it 4 star even for the 0 stat recording."
3,Quality vs Recording,"While the music was indeed stirring, suitably imperious, and full of French martial pride, the recording was of a rather poor quality. The brass instruments sounded off key and very ""tin"" like. In the background I could hear what sounded like a static which reminded me of a record player. It was as if the CD had just been a direct copy from an old slightly worn out vinyl record. The poor recording quality makes listening enjoyment difficult. The music is great but the recording quality will most likely grate upon the ears. Timeless, good, stirring music loses its effect when accompanied by ""fft..skip...ffft..skip...fft."""
1,BORING,"These workouts are boring and lazy. I lost my ABS DIET WORKOUT 2 DVD, so I thought I would give this workout a try, since I bought the book. Man, this DVD is not what I expected. I will buy the abs diet workout 2 again, that dvd has a schedule and you can mix workouts and I think the workouts are much harder because it has a guy trainer. Plus, he's better to look at than a woman. Go with the ABS DIET WORKOUT 2 DVD if you want a good workout."
3,NICE HAT,the hat is very nice but the elastic is a little tight on the head it takes alittle getting used to.
3,Kids love it.....I hate it!,"Beware, this is a very annoying toy! It makes a lot of noise with no volume control! Let me also say that usually loud toys do not bother me, but this one does! If it had a mute or volume button, it would be an awesome toy.Both of my 4 year old boys love this action figure. Superman's cape blows like he is flying (and makes a loud wind sound), his arms move up and down (and makes a loud smashing sound) and his eyes light up for x-ray vision (and makes a loud ray sound).Unfortunately, he seems very durable! He flys solo down the stairs and off the furniture and hasn't broken yet. Both boys want to play with him and they fight over who's turn it is; but I find it so annoying that I refuse to buy a second one.Grandma wonders why Superman hasn't lost his batteries or just completely disappeared, but they really love him. My solution is to make them play with it outside or in the basement so I don't have to hear it."
4,my son was so excited!,"My son a is big superman fan! He was so excited when he got this for his 6th birthday. It can be a bit noisy, but that fact that he enjoys it so much makes the noise worth it. I would recommend this toy for any little boy who likes pretending to be a superhero."
5,This is the first book anyone in singles ministry should own,"If you're involved with a ministry with single adults, this is the first book you should own. There's a chapter on every area of ministry: single parents, divorce recovery, Bible study... Each chapter is written by an experienced singles leader or pastor."
5,"Excellent book, I wish I had read it 12 Years ago !","The author has done an excellent job of laying out the Idea (Mind) Mapping logic and concepts. It is obvious that the book was written by someone who actually uses this process on a day to day basis. The book also includes a ton of examples from others that use that use it in a variety of situations.I have used this process regularly for about 15 years. It is really a fantastic tool and has helped me through some tough projects. It is now my ""default"" starting point. Jamie makes it simple to understand and do."
5,1 Map Vs. 50 Pages... I'll take 1 Visually Appealing Map,"I've been impressed by Jamie Nast and her philosophy of Idea Mapping. I especially like the concept that you can put a complex idea on one page, and Jamie is running with it. I don't know about you, but I'd rather see a business plan on one gorgeous map than 50 droning pages. I'm also happy that Jamie considers software a legitimate venue for mapping (I especially like MindManager, which Jamie endorses at her website). A resource idea mappers at all levels need to checkout."
2,Very little substance,"This book is yet another example of 15 pages worth of substance spread over 240 pages of fluff. A person would be much better served downloading the trial version of ""Mindmanager"" software and just following the included tutorial. It will teach you everything this book has to offer in a fraction of the time."
4,Idea Mapping,A useful guide to this concept and support for those interested in buying MindJet mind mapping software
1,+CD misleading,I would like to point out that the CD only has a 21 day trial. At that point you would have to pay $350 for a license from mindjet.
1,Account of a life destroyed by voodoo science,"This is a tragic account of yet another victim of the recovered memory therapy craze that stuck the United States and many other English-speaking countries in the late 80's and early 90's. Even though the theories have been debunked and the thereapy is in general disrepute, the harm goes on and on."
1,An account of the creation of false memories,Beckylane describes her memories of ritual abuse which appear to be distortions of needed medical treatments performed on her as a child by her mother.A very sad account of the damage that false memories can do to an adult.
2,Could be better,"A good oompah and drum band; but the love affair ended when I discovered that the band gave only an abridged version of ""High School Cadets."" (Not the best first impression to make on a one-time Washington High School Cadet.) What else they cut short, I don't know."
3,Ho hum yawn,"Perhaps it is my short attention span or my lack of interest in this book, but I felt the information in this book was puffed up with alot of technical jargon and not much consistency.Using multi-threading classes was a good idea, but how it was explained was boring and shuffled throughout the book."
3,"Informative, but very, very dry......","This book is very informative if your interested in learning how operating systems work. Unfortunately, Im not really interested in it, I just have to read it for a required class. The material is very dry so its hard to focus on what your reading."
3,OK,Book in good condition. However it was an asian edition and hence different from the original one. Exercises and problems on back were also different.
3,This was purchased for a class,It is very informational. I didn't really care for the class though but the book was very thorough and had all the information I needed.
4,Great intro to operating systems,"Everyone in software should read the first three or four chapters of this book. Although one can write software and be unaware of the structure and operation of the OS, the extra information can provide great insights into design and troubleshooting. The book also has some very interesting projects scatter throughout (i.e. adding a system call to the Linux kernel)."
4,Good OS txt,"Very helpful in understanding basic concepts. Examples is what makes this text stand out, with plenty of examples, and a good website to view source code"
4,Great OS concepts and design reference,"This was the text used in the Operating Systems course when I was in undergrad. It was a useful reference for my projects including a CPU scheduler, file system implementation, caching algorithms, etc. It's more conceptual, which I like--it's more important to truely understand the concepts and I think that once you have that, the implementation is often the easy part.This book was also instrumental in my understanding of synchronization and multi-threaded programming."
4,Opearing systems concept,I have been using this book for my master in IT science and it has been a great help in my studies. I hardly have to go elsewhere for research; its content is very clear and very concrete. I have to say that this book has added a great value to my studies.
1,One of my least favorites,"I'm using this book in a graduate level computer science course, and find this book to be the most boring textbook I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The wording in this textbook is very dry and uninteresting, and the author makes no attempt to keep the reader's interest in the materials he is presenting. The only positive I can say, is that I got this book used off of Amazon for only six dollars, and it arrived in almost brand new condition."
5,Short-Term Review of VE-640,"VE-640, purchased from Pop Pop Office machines through Amazon.com,was delivered 6 days after placing order (4 days before the first expected delivery date). I have had it only 5 days. Hooked it up initially to a rabbit ear antenna with reasonably good reception for channels 7 and above, poor reception for channel 4 & 5, and no reception for channel 2. Changed over to cable with excellent results. FM and AM also work well. I am very pleased with the unit so far, and will see if it remains operational over the next year, or fails as indicated by several of the other reviews."
5,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MUSIC,AS A DOCTOR OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE T.C.M. I OFTEN PLAY MUSIC FOR MY PATIENTS DURING ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT FOR RELAXATION AND HEALING PURPOSES. MOST OF MY PATIENTS PREFER LISTENING TO TRADITIONAL CHINESE MUSIC AND SOME ASK TO BORROW MY CD TO LISTEN AT HOME. THIS IS A GREAT CD TO EXPERIENCE MUSIC FROM CHINA IN THE TRADITIONAL MANNER. DR. RICK LENGYEL
4,Very Nice Music Indeed,I came into this cd because I was looking for peruvian instrumental music and I am really happy with the results I've got. This is one of the best cds I found.
2,wrong music,this was not the kind of flute music i was looking for. it was nice but i am looking more for mystical sounds.
1,The Jackson's A Family Dynasty,"I found this DVD very boring. It just followed the brothers trying to come together to do a concert. Jermaine Jackson did nothing but complain or not turn up to meetings. He seemed to want his own limelight. To be taken care of by his wife! The others did their best but it seemed very half hearted. It was very sad for them though, when Michael passed away. He did not appear in any footage previous to his passing. The second DVD did not work in Australia!"
2,You have to be kidding me,"Yes I watched this and quite frankly, I see a bunch of old guys trying to recapture the fame they feel is due them. I grew up with the Jackson's just like all of the other Baby Boomers, born the same year as Michael, and back in the day, I lived ""The Jackson Five."" I had the Right On magazine pictures on my bedroom wall, posters and every article ever written about the famous brothers. I knew all of their stats, even thought I was going to marry Tito, but of course that was a dream never to surface, since they didn't connect with African American people like that. Enough said, this series is a joke for sure."
1,"boring, disappointing, sad","We had been hoping to watch something with more substance (and music!) than this. Instead, what we got was a look at a disfunctional group of people attempting to relive past glories instead of finding something new of their own. It was painfully obvious that egos were far too inflated for any sort of cooperation to take place. I feel bad for the families. Don't bother with this unless you have money to throw away (and if you do have that kind of cash, a charity would be far more deserving)"
5,tasty snack,"Had never tried anything made with spelt so ordered these snacks. They are quite tasty, fresh and not oversalted. Try them the price per package is right."
1,Stay Away,"While the piping is excellent, the audio, particularly in the first half of the cd is terrible. Nearly 15 minutes are almost indecipherable. I think the recording was made with a hand held mike at the edge of a field."
2,This is a live recording,"This is a live recording, so you are going to hear clapping and background noise in addition to wind throughout each song. It's not just at the beginning and end. The quality of the recording is also very poor. I got this for my boyfriend who enjoys bagpipe music but he rarely listens to it since its annoying to hear the background noise."
2,Huh? Iam sorry I can't hear so well..,"This is a good performance and a poor recording. The title sounded cool, but the album does not pull it off."
2,"Artistry is wonderful, when u can hear it","I absolutely love a good Tattoo! I just listened to the samples of the music and was shocked at what poor quality it is. I do understand it was an outside recording and as in an earlier comment they did as good of a job as possible, and there was the noise of the crowd. I feel like this music is ingrained in my soul and would not, could not, sell a sound recording with such little respect.The wonderful Artistry of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo deserves better than that. It's a shame the quality of the recording is so bad, I would have absolutely loved to have a good recording of this amazing work."
3,iPod Mini,"I was a little disappointed by the condition of the iPod-several scratches and dents. So I think it was a bit overpriced, considering the appearance. Since returning the iPod once for service, it has worked fine."
4,Cool gadget,I really enjoy the iPod mini. What I dislike is using itunes. I also have musicmatch which I like better and is more user friendly. The iPod itself is really cool and does what it says it will. It is nice and small and works great.
2,Features seem impressive BUT horrible sound,"These speakers are currently on demo at many Best Buys. I was interested because the features were impressive (3 way, large woofer, looks nice), especially considering the price. Plus, they were Yamahas.However, I was very disappointed with the sound. Everything sounds really ""harsh"". Probably because the cabinet is extremely thin (can almost be used as a drum!). The bass hardly comes through. The cheaper Sony sounded better.Don't buy these before listening to them."
5,A big enjoyment,"This is a superb collection of puzzles of all kinds. Anyone experienced or not in the puzzle field should own this book.Martin Gardner is a guarantee for this book's efficiency, and highly educational and entertaining content. 5/5"
3,Gardner's tougher problems,"I came to this book having been exposed to Martin Gardner's puzzles through the Aha! and Eureka! books and a smattering of examples from other places.They didn't prepare me for this. This book is chock full of puzzles and problems in various areas, but only earliest puzzles in each section are on the difficulty level of the Aha!/Eureka! books (or some of his small collected puzzle books) - the latter puzzles are much more difficult and likely to require serious math and lots of pen and paper time.So, I'd recommend this - in fact, I hope more people try it out - just be prepared for serious challenges in math and logic."
4,Great for rainy days,Our family has enjoyed these puzzles on many rainy days. It is interesting to watch each member of the family as they find a solution in their own unique way.
4,More than a cookbook,"Very pleased with this book. Not only does it have tasty, easy to prepare recipes but the information contained in Part One should be compulsory reading for all involved with any friend or loved one who has a problem with swallowing as a result of certain medical conditions.Also the nutritional information given at the bottom of each recipe is particularly helpful when counting calories to maintain/gain weight."
4,I purchased as a gift for a friend...,A very close friend had surgery that caused difficulties in swallowing. Found this book online and gave it to her as a gift and she loves it.A must have for anyone suffering from swallowing issues.
4,Cook Book Review,The book had some good recipes. I guess I thought it would have more than soup recipes in it.I would recommend this book to any friend.
4,Poly track bar bushings,The new bushings fixed the clunk in my front suspention. A bit of a pain to install but work great once in place
1,Disappointed,I purchased this watch few days back. It arrived right on time but unfortunately the watch was not working.I thought maybe the battery died so I went to change the battery. But the repair place told me that battery is fine and there is something wrong with the motion of the watch. I am really disappointed as the watch send to me is a defective one.So beware of this problem with this watch.
2,My Watch Broke,"I cannot give a true rating ""like or dislike"" because when I received the watch, it was displayed in a beautiful box, the design was beautiful but the enclosed instructions were so small. You need a magnify glass to read details about the watch. When I was trying to reset the time the stem broke off. This watch was a birthday gift and I was so disappointed that it broke. It took several phone calls to get the right customer service rep to help.At the present time, I had to pay $4 to ship the watch to New York where it will hopefully be repaired or replaced. Maybe I can give a better review of this product if and when I get my birthday watch!!"
2,got allergies from the metal,i love this watch except that the metal that touches my skin always leave rashes on my arm and it is very itchy.
3,Page missing,"The book overall was as described except that a frontpiece chart was half missing, a disappointment. Gary"
2,Tedious...,...at best.I'm an avid reader and enjoyed this to a point. As a snapshop into the depravity of the addicted mind this was a decent read.The language is concise and the author well informed.I just found the story very bleak and uninteresting once the doomed pair relapse for the first time.As a recovering addict of various intoxicants I did not feel compelled to get through what reads like a parallel rehashing of my own life experiences.I would recommend this to anyone that thinks drugs are a fun ride without consequences.
4,Living to Get High,"This book really demonstrates how dependent and pathetic heroin users can be. All their time is centered on somehow coming up with enough money to buy some more heroin. The worst for them is withdrawl.The book went into a little bit about how users process the stuff, but there wasn't that much on their trips. Parts of it were funny--like when this guy is going through withdrawl as he's trying to help his buddy plant a marijuana plot. It reads well/easily. Not a bad book."
2,it isnt for me,"This book just didnt grab my attention it took me forever to read it becuase i was so uninterested.Ive read a few other books that dealt with drugs and love and this is the only one that bored me.One of the main things that bored me was the word choice ,in parts of the books were i was supposed to be excited i wasn't and it was because of the way things were written."
2,Not worth the paper it's printed on.,"Ever since Trainspotting appeared on the big screen, the heroin subculture has put down roots in both literature and film. Luke Davies concentrates as much on preferred syringes as on the adventure of getting heroin. The Candy of the title is both the woman that the narrator falls in love with and the stuff that he takes. Starting out in Sydney, the couple moves to Melbourne to go straight but of course they relapse. They engage in a tedious round of finding money and smack, in which all other attachments become pointless. Quite honestly, I thought it was a pretty awful book. I just couldn't get around all the poor language."
4,Bittersweet Candy,"This novel incorporates a mixture of complex and sometimes conflicting themes- love, hope, and addiction.You join the narrator and his girlfriend Candy on a roller-coaster ride of heroin addiction, which quickly spirals out of control. For these characters, each day becomes a desperate struggle to maintain their heroin addiction, and ,in the same light, a battle to find a reason to quit. It becomes clear that the characters not only fear the pain of withdrawl, but also the severe reality which they must face without heroin as their emotional crutch.As I read this book, I wanted the characters' love for one another to survive. However,in order to escape their addiction, to truly move toward a new future, they would have to escape their past...including their past with one other.This book is terrifying and frustrating at times, and, although bittersweet, you're confident it could not have ended any other way. Satisfying and touching story."
5,Share this book with a friend,"This is a wondefully-told tale of terrible lives. Unlike other junkie books I've read, Davies never gives you the ""I haven't had all the breaks in life, so have pity on me"" slant. Told in strong prose with intelligence and humor (the episode of the ""projectile syringe"" is just one example). Please share this book with a friend. Better yet, share this book with a stranger with whom you want to be friends."
3,Interesting book on addiction and its effect on a relationship,"This is an interesting first-person narrative on heroin addiction and the consequences of that addiction on two individuals in a romantic relationship. The situations that they encounter are fairly unique, compared to other novels I've read on addition. It takes place in Australia; consequently, the writer's ""voice"" in the story has a thick Australian accent which can be difficult to read. For being a paperback, I appreciated that the font was smaller so that it took me longer than an afternoon or a day to read."
5,Excellent novel,"Candy is a great novel that details the life of the main character, Candy and her boyfriend who becomes her pimp. A must read, the author does a great job telling the story of addiction, and the life of an addict. I would bypass the movie (it's awful) and go right to this book. The novel moves quickly and is very interesting."
5,Candy,"I first chose to read candy becuase of the cover (now what was that old cliche'?) since then I have read it at least 5 times and have cried every single time.Candy is a very powerful novel about 2 junkies living in the inner Melbourne suburbs of Australia. Even though Candy is undoubtedly a very depressing novel, it is also funny, shocking and very truthful. Unlike many authors who write about drug cultures, Luke Davies defintaly knows his stuff. For anyone who has not read it, I would definatly recommend it, its just a fantastic , well written story that will have you crying one minute and laughing the next. If I could give it 10 stars, I would."
5,Totally mezmerizing!!!,Candy was one of the most brutually honest books I ever read on addiction. Two pages into the story and I was hooked as well into the hellish descent of heroin addiction. Davies writes with such emotional power and description that you almost feel as if you were with the characters. I almost wish that there was a sequel to this but I look forward to reading more of his works.
3,candy,"I bought the book thinking it was what I wanted but alas it was a different version and not the one I hoped for, the book is what it says and the condition etc was what the seller said , but the cost to buy it was way too much and to come from the USA was very costly (more than the book).To send it back would cost the same and no payment for this and some charge at USA to take it back ,so not a good buy from my point of view.The name was right the condition was correct the overall cost was not"
5,Candy is Dandy,"The book is a drug, and I can't put it down. The way Davies writes is so undescribably beautiful and at the same time astoundingly profound, it's obiously a novel of experience. I've never read a book that so honestly allows you to see the good side, the why, the way Candy does. That's what makes it so perfect, because you don't feel like you're reading a lie, like so many things out there that try to prevent drug abuse. The book is amazing, and even if you've never tried anything, like me, you should read it, if only for it's beautiful poetic nature and it's shocking truth."
5,Not just for kids!!!,I bought this for my signifcant other who has a thing for Superman. He loves it. He even displays it and wore it for Holloween. Who says a toy is just for kids?!
1,don't recommend,"is a book. CD is only two songs. Wish I had paid closer attention to the advertisement! Not really worth it, in my opinion. Music is of course top notch MSR, but you are really buying a book with bonus two songs on cd. Not really about the music."
2,Not as good as expected,The arrangements are not very interesting. I had hoped to find the melodies shared fairly equally between the two parts and more unusual than the standard arrangements of Christmas music. These were a disappointment.
3,First time ever disappointed with a Manheim CD,"I have purchased every CD that Manheim has ever put out. This is the first one that I've been disappointed with. It's 2 CD's, so there are quite a choice to choose from. Most of the music is much lower key then is usual from Manheim. I love their upbeat music, which is what initially drew me to them many moons ago. This one is not real upbeat, which the exception of 3 choices.Hopefully, when their next CD gets released, they get back to what made them the GO TO choice for this type music."
2,Not worth it,"The multimedia is inconsistant, barely there, and not much help The INTRODUCTORY VERSION of VC++ is useless...If you really want to learn this language, buy microsoft's other versions of the manuals.... Then buy a full version of VC++ software separately. I returned my kit like this and did just that!!! MS makes a realy cool visual combo book pack with all the diff languages for Visual ... they sell it here on Amazon...."
4,Leg Relief,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BECAUSE I AM HAVING A LOT OF PAIN IN ONE OF MY LEGS. I HAVE A LITTLE HEIGHT, SO WHEN I GETTING OFF THE TOILET, I WAS EXPERIENCING A LOT OF PAIN. THIS RISER HAS HELPED TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT PAIN. ALSO, I AM PUTTING A LOT LESS PRESSURE ON THE TOILET WHEN I SIT DOWN ON IT."
4,Happy with product,Product works fabulously. It arrived quickly. I would recommend this product to anyone with problems rising from a sitting position.
5,Good buy!,"Well made, solid, doesn't slip. The listed measurements were accurate. It was very helpful to have this. Family members appreciated that it is easily removed and put back in place. It is also easy to clean. The price was fair and made it a good value."
1,Not Right Product for us,Item returned. We were looking for a raised toilet seat that had a bigger opening and would fit our toilet (we have an elongated toilet bowl).Return was easy.
4,"Excellent, Low Cost Product",I bought this for myself to use after hip surgery. I recommend it for its low cost and ease of use.
2,Too high for standard toilet,"I bought this for recovery after a double hip replacement for a 5' 10"" tall man. It was way too high on a standard height toilet. His legs went numb while sitting on it because his feet did not sit flat on the floor. It may work for older toilets that are very low, but did not work for us. I wish I had bought a 3 inch riser, but the reviews for this one seemed like it would work great. I wish I had measured the toilet we have from the floor first to get the correct lift."
2,I had a number of issues with it,"After back surgery it was difficult for me to get up and down the toilet seat. However the riser seat was not the right solution for me.The riser seat is not comfortable for short people. It provided some minor aid in getting up and sitting down, but doing your business when your feet don't touch the ground turned out pretty difficult.When I sat closer to the front, so I could touch the ground the seat shifted as I did not distribute the weight equally. It did not feel safe, it was too warbly.I found that the seat that fits over the toiletMedline 4-in-1 Steel Commodemuch more comfortable and the handles provided additional aid. I felt very secure even when I had problems with my balance."
2,not useful,"I bought this item hoping I could take it with me on a trip. It was too bulky for one, but very unstable even when I tried to set it up."
1,Does not fit standard Kohler toilet,"This product does not fit a standard Kohler toiler seat - therefore, I would purchase this product cautiously -- using the specifications of the product and your toilet seat dimensions. I wasted my money."
1,Doesn't fit toilets,"I just received this riser. I have 4 toilets in my house and it will fit only one, and that one is the powder room, not where I need it. To fit any of the others I will have to remove the toilet seat and lid. We have ordinary elongated toilets in this house."
3,Life saver,"I recently bought this product for an aging relative. Getting up and down from the toilet caused excruciating pain. I live nearly 9 hours from her, and this simple product is able to give me some piece of mind. It easily fits on the toilet, and can be removed easily if company is coming to visit. It is well worth the investment."
4,"For the money, a good value.....",I need the riser due to arthritic knees and the price of this riser is better than I could find locally. I bought several to quality for free shipping so I am set for a while. They are sturdy and hold up for quite some time before cracking. Then I just toss 'em and replace with a new one. I'm satisfied with my purchase and will buy this item again.
4,"Not Fancy, But It Works !","My preference would have been for an ""elongated"" design to better fit the toilet as well as my posterior (I'm a big guy). But let's face it, this model gets the job done and the price is right. It was a big help following my knee replacement surgery."
1,does not fit,The ad said it will fit any type of toilet seat.....it did not. I do not recommend buying it unless the page clarifies the fact that it is not a universal toilet seat.
2,Nothing special.,I agree with the previous reviewer. The tracks on the cds are really boring. I'm into club music so i can say that the only good thing on this cd is the J. Beck Dance Mix (it's not even a full club mix but only a radio edit haha!). The rest u can just skip (not saying that the dance mix is special - it's just the best thing on the cd). And if u are a fan of R&B just buy the album.
1,this is plain boring,this is awful boring and a cure for my insomnia only horny girls will find something appealing about this tired song.
5,A TREAT 4 REAL DC FANS,I disagree wholehaertedly with the first two critics. Actually I wonder if we were listening to the same tracks. 'Cater 2 U ' is the best track on the album and I will go as far to say it will nab the trio at least 2 Grammy Awards for best performance by a duo or group and best R&b song! These remixes are stellar and compliments to the original version. Kudos to the remixers who had to be creative to put a spin on a quintessential perfect R&B record. This isn't a pop song and finds the girls in soul mode were they perform best.
5,Classic oldies redone beautifully,"An underrated jazz supergroup featuring George Jinda, Najee, Omar Hakim, John Scofield, Bill Evans, Nile Rodgers, Bernard Wright and others, these seasoned veterans of jazz got together in 1988 to create jazzy, soulful, and occasionally funky 80s-styled renditions of several of the classic oldies of the 60s. A sax-ified, soulful instrumental of the Jackson 5's ""I'll Be There,"" a less-rollicking but smooth and cool instrumental reworking of Junior Walker's classic ""Shotgun,"" and a funky Sly & The Family Stone medley driven by the funky guitars of Nile Rodgers are just some of the great stuff you'll find here, and ""Stand By Me"" and ""Dock Of The Bay"" are reworked into a couple of stylish smooth jazz numbers that do a great job of stretching their melodic creativity so as not to sound like more than just simply wordless versions of these familiar tunes."
4,"well made and sturdy, but may be tight fit for 42"" TV","This is a well made adapter and is just the thing for a larger TV to be used with a heavy duty VESA mount. It's strong so it can easily handle a hefty TV, and has a durable dark coating. The spacing of the mounting holes on my 42"" TV (Sharp LCD) was an 1/8"" too far apart for the available holes, so I ended up having to file out the last available hole in each bracket into a slot so it would fit. Other 42"" TVs may have the same issue, but smaller TVs should work well without modification."
2,List all the cities in Texas,"Not much on reading, just packed with information to use with your GPS unit. This companion list all the cities in the state with their latitude and longitude cordinences."
2,I wish Clifford had saved the day some other way!,"Dear Parent: if you have a child that is all prone to anxiety or irrational fears: this books is not for your child! I wish that the author had come up with an alternative way for Clifford to save the day. Spare us the BRIDGE COLLAPSING into the river and the vivid illustration. I realize the story is fictional, but my 6 and 4 year old children were quite alarmed by this part of the story. My 6 year old probed: Will that happen to us one day on a bridge? Is that real?I think there could have been a more creative and less alarming story plot with regard to the city bridge.Otherwise, Cliford's involvement in the day's activities and parade is amusing and thoughtful."
2,it was not what i expected,This is a very small book about Chineese superstitions. The author uses the same forematfor each concept she discusses. It soon became repeditative and I lost interest after the firstchapter. look somewhere else for Chineese luck
5,Comfortable Enjoyable Nature at Its Best,"I love nature and would rather live in the woods somewhere peaceful and quiet than in a city. Reading the books written by Ms. Rich has given me the opportunity to whisk away to a cabin under the trees and learn more about what is around us. Her books aren't ""preachy"" but more appreciative looks at what is right in front of us. Her stories about the animals that share the woods with her are knowledgeable but also warm in the relationships she has with the deer, the rabbits, the birds, a groundhog and others. I sat down with this book and didn't come up for air until I was finished. Her writing pulls you right along. You can't wait to find out what comes next."
1,Doesn't live up to claims,"It's too short for standard loaves of sliced bread and is a pain to close (it doesn't seal well, either). Bread doesn't last any longer in it than it does in the original plastic bag."
1,Do it yourself!,"If you sew at all, or know someone who does, just make your own bread bags! Measure the loaves you want to cover, cut fabric to that measure plus seam allowances, and add space at the top for a drawstring. Incredibly simple.If you want a plastic lining (do you really want to store warm food inside soft plastic?) that is also easy to do for anyone with even rudimentary sewing skills. I like organic cotton, cotton ticking, or cotton drill cloth for a project like this. Of course prewash the chosen fabric, and it will be easily machine washable all of its useful life.Come on, guys! Be self sufficient! Using this method, you can have custom-made bread bags for your custom-made artisan bread."
3,Design Needs Modification,"Overall this is a great idea and seems like it would work well if some slight modifications were made to the design. The velcro/hook & loop strap that closes the bag is simply not long enough. After folding the bag over only ONCE or TWICE (which is not really enough to make a good seal) the velcro straps will only overlap approx. 1 inch. They need to overlap at least 3 inches in order to provide a good seal and not pop open. I currently use the bag (it works great in all other respects) but I have discontinued using the strap, and instead use a binder clip or clothespin. As other reviewers have noted, the material is very sturdy and it works well on its side or on its end. It also works great in the freezer and fits large size homemade loaves."
3,Run of the Mill,"I bought this as a gift, very basic straight forward. Not very fancy. Get what you ask for I suppose."
4,Keeps store bought bread soft for longer,Keeps store bought bread soft for longer. They could have designed the velcro closure so that you could roll the bag down to the size of the bread thereby squeezing and keeping more air out. You can still do that with this bag but its current velcro closure is designed for a single fold. Needs an occasional sniff test and wash; need to check that the plastic creases/corners are dry before using it again. I would suggest first putting bread in a plastic bag if it did not already have one before putting it in this one.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this product for my daughter and her new husband as one of their wedding gifts for their kitchen. They used it without any complaint until the inner plastic bag started tearing. It only lasted about 4 months of occasional use. My son-in-law told me that he had to remove the plastic liner and he still has the outer bag, but of course it is no longer good to store bread in to keep it fresh.I really don't like purchasing a gift for someone, just to find out a few months later that the item was of no good use. A plastic gallon-sized zip-lock bag works better to store the bread in than this product. I think the makers of this bread bag would do their customers a service by taking this product off the shelves and going back to the drawing board. If you are considering the purchase of this item, my best advice is ""don't""."
4,Best Manufacturers Reusable Bread Storage Bag,"Product was great. Great visual appeal. My homemade bread fit the bag perfect. My family really liked it.I am going to purchase another. My only downside are the velcro strips don't always line up, but that will not stop me from purchasing another."
1,Learning Spanish,I feel that this book was a waste of my money. Many of the words don't fit in line with my desire to learn better spanish.
3,Not Her Best,"Usually, I enjoy Meryl Sawyer's books, but this time it feels like she tried too hard. Especially at the end. It just felt like she ran out of time on her deadline and had to think up a quick ending. I gave it 3 stars because it does feel like a classic Meryl Sawyer read, but it just didn't have that extra oomph that she usually has."
2,Little more than a curiosity,"Boy am I old. I bought this in Jamaica when it was first released on LP. Listening to the sample clips now, I think it isn't very good. Ain't Too Proud to Beg is pleasant, and Norma Jean remains quaint and a bit funny. In the original liner notes, Donaldson, rather than Elton John, was credited with writing Norma Jean, which is, of course, Candle in the Wind."
4,Moist Meat,"I purchased the Rocket Roaster the other day and was excited to use today. 2.5 hours later, I pulled out the 7 pound chicken and it was a golden brown color. I let it rest for 15 minutes and cut off a leg. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful due to the garlic and hotsauce injection. The only dissapointment was the meat was slightly smoked. I will try to use finer and dried woodchips next time to see what happens. The good thing about this product, anyone can cooked a great looking bird that is moist and tender. I cant wait until Thanksgiving and load it with a 14 pound turkey."
5,Culinary delight,"If you like turkey, and insist on nothing but the best, then this is the roaster for you. Your guests will rave about how tender and moist the turkey is, and the bird won't last long. So, you might as well buy two of them and cook 2 turkeys at once. You'll need them. load it, light it, and walk away for 2 1/2 hours. It doesn't get any easier than that."
2,Product leaked on first re-charge,"I have used these products before in the past. I love the way that they heat up so quickly and provide reliable heat at cold football games. I especially admire the fact that they are reusable which means a cost savings and less waste.After using it for the first time, I went to recharge the unit following the instructions and everything seemed to go fine. Later, after the unit had cooled, I noticed that the chemical reaction had taken place and leaked out of the package due to a small hole in the vinyl pouch. It made quite a mess and I had to throw the unit out.While I like the soft feel of the vinyl pouch, in the past I bought similar warmers that came in a more rigid plastic pouch. I never had any problems recharging those units. I noticed that some companies still offer this type of handwarmer.I am hoping that this was just a defective design since I ordered four of these for my family to use."
2,more of a novelty,Only provides heat for 45 minutes. A hassle to reset (heat in pot on stove). It does provide a lot of heat quickly.
3,"Ok, but high water content","I had a couple of sodium acetate warmers a few years ago that were larger, got warmer, and held their heat longer. These are smaller, squishier, and less effective (lower concentration of sodium acetate vs. water). They are also the least expensive ones you can find -- you get what you pay for. On the plus side, their squishiness makes them mold to your body better if you're using them for sore muscles/joints."
2,"Is this a toy? Durable but bulky, reusuable but not long lasting","The man in the picture has monster hands. I'm just kidding. The pouches are not that big but I'm an adult large and these wouldn't fit in a pair of my gloves or anything like that. Inside a jacket pocket is the option you'd have to go with. Unless you have freakishly large hands, in that case buying gloves must be a chore for you anyway. sorry buddy. ;)This past winter I didn't use them that much. I just bought better gloves.Wish they were smaller, hotter and lasted longer. Good job on durability tho, these are tough."
4,Does what it claims,This is a good product which does everything it says and is very easy to use. No brain surgery needed.
2,Messy operation,"It does not last too hor for a long time to be therapeutic enough. It is a little cumbersome to boil water, wrap package, and wait the necessary time till it liquifies."
4,"Not really a Toy, they work well","I don't know why these hand warmers would be catagorized as toys, but they function fairly well. I ordered several and I did get one bad one, it was almost a solid when it arrived. The others worked as expected and were reusable as stated. Doesn't get very hot, but will warm you hands when put into mittens that accept heaters like these."
3,"Fun novelty, but not practicle for us","Kids and friends love watching the transformation! However, we never seem to remember to recharge it to have it ready for next time. I suppose we would do better if we had a daily use, but for occasional use it seems like too much trouble."
3,"Nice, but not practical","I bought this to use after snowboarding. It gives you a fuzzy feeling whenever you use it, so don't expect to get your hands out of ice with this.This isn't so practical when you're staying at a hotel. After using it after snowboarding, I tried to use the hottest water I could from the hotel, but could barely get it to dissolve the crystals. So now I know this thing is only good for one use when I'm not near a stove.One time I kept it in a box in my camelbak, to prevent it from freezing or getting too cold. When I took it out to check on it, the outer plastic was firm, but think it would still have worked because the inside was still liquid. My hands weren't too cold, so I didn't use it to see how it would work while in that condition. I think I'll try wrapping it in a cloth or scarf in my box for next time."
2,LARGE,"the product works well enough its just very big. I ordered two but the company only sent me one. Weeks later i did get the refund from Amazon. Amazon rocks, proheat reusable hand warmer, not so much."
2,Beaufighter in action-A review.,"This book falls short of the high standard of most Squadron-Signal ""in action"" books. There is too much about Blenheim, Beaufort, Brigand, not enough about Beaufighter.And there is a serious error: the wingspan is listed as 75 feet 10 inches instead of the correct 57 feet 10 inches.Despite these shortfalls, it is still a valuable resource for modelers and aero history buffs."
2,Interesting and disappointing,"The general text and photos are valuable, but some typing errors occured in the legends. The chapter about the Brigand could have been shorter, in order, for example, to leave some place for a three views drawing of the Mk X. I find it a good idea to describe shortly the Beaufort, since that plane has been obscured by the Beaufighter. I was astonished to notice that : 1. all the three views drawings are more or less filled with errors, some of which as big as the Hercules engines which have been... inversed ! 2. part of the summaries of the specifications (performances) are identical either for Mk I, Mk II and Mk 21"
5,a pratical book about some complicated things,"amazing is all i can call it... as a marketing managememt student i found myself having to study complicated book about all the things i need to know... specially when it come to studying statistical analysis... but this book can really explain in a very funny, interesting and pratical maner, allowing us to study like if we were reading a cartoon's book... I wish some of my teachers could do the same as this book... ;)"
3,description is confusing,I am confused by the description. It states it has a chain attached. But it also states you can buy a additional chain for $. I thought it was a pill container. I am confused.Where/how would a chain be utilized making it a necklace???
5,Roy Hall Knows His Stuff!,"First Rate Turntable! While it is easily possible to drop far more cash on esoteric models by other manufacturers, I don't think you can actually buy much more performance except in perhaps a <1% degree. Very respectable Project tone arm, heavy glass platter, included Goldring cartridge is a decent introductory, but begs for an upgrade. I outfitted my MMF-5 with a Sumiko Blackbird, which is easily superior to all other entries in the <$1000 category IMHO, and my ears! Very Nice piano finish and heavy hinged dust cover, adjustable VTA, all brought together in a stylish component! For another $500+ the next modelMusic Hall MMF 7 Turntableis also a good option, with some additional features, but one will pay a premium for slightly incremental upgrade."
3,Not all digital,After listening to the CD it was obvious that some of the recordings were from analog sources. The William Tell Overture was especially hissy. It seems like they could have cleaned up a bit before dubbing to CD.It's an OK CD for the price.
2,Broke within months,"Shipping from target took weeks longer than expected, and the box was totally ripped up and open when it finally arrived. It looked ok once I finally got it together but it broke within the first year I owned it. I've been sitting on it since then with a stack of textbooks holding the bottom up.I have the matching chair and ottoman too--which are holding up ok and seem to be much sturdier. I wouldn't recommend the loveseat though."
1,"Too exspensive, low quality","I bought this sofa for my office about 3 years ago with an included ottoman for much less (-30%) then the current price for the sofa without the ottoman.It arrived with a busted rail and I was able to get the manufacturer to send me a replacement fairly easily by looking up the number on the assembly instructions.Once I finally got it together it was great for a about a year and then one evening I sat on it and the rail busted, much like how the original rail arrived.I'm 200lbs but I never abused or jumped up and down on it. At its current price it is way to expensive for the quality."
2,Works ok(sometimes) but itunes is terrible,"Ive got the Ipod for about 7 months now. Havent had any major problems, but a lot of minor ones.The menu button stops working whenever it pleases and works again spontaneously(after a while though).There have been a couple of times that i just cant turn it off.(of course the hold switch was disabled) no matter what I do.And for the worse part......... Itunes. I cant beleive Apple hasnt come up with a windows explorer type of interphase or anything easier than Itunes. Adding or removing songs is a hassle, not to mention that if you make a mistake in adding files or folders to your library youll end up with thousands of repeated songs.The Ipod does what its supposed to do but it is definetely not the easiest most intuitive piece of hardware out there."
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,"I had researched all mp3 players before deciding on iPod. I really like the way it looks, and the storage space is remarkable. However, from the first day I started using it, I've had problems with the software. It makes my computer ""freeze"" and like others have said, it continuously states ""do not disconnect"". I have very mixed feelings with this product especially considering the price tag. I hope Apple representatives read these reviews and get to work to fix the problems that a lot of people are encountering. C'mon Apple, you can do it! I do not recommend buying this product."
1,Screen cracked in less than a month,"My daughter got this for Christmas and the screen cracked after one month. It wasn't dropped, or damaged in any way. I called Apple & they basically told me it was our fault and too bad. I won't buy any Apple product again. That's the quickest $300 I've ever wasted. Buyer beware!"
5,SIMPLY AMAZING,"I was thinking of getting this or the Sony Vaio Pocket VGF-AP1L digital music player(I love Sony) but in all, I decided on this. There is no other word to describe it but amazing. It holds a ton of pictures, it shows album art, and you can get a cable extra(which I did) which lets you put the photos you have on the little color screen onto the TV for a slideshow, and you can use music on your iPod for background music. Anyways, I have no complaints, it is great!"
2,iPod Photo + USB 2.0 = Trouble,"I've never bought an Apple product before, and I'm sorely disappointed in the vaunted ""ease of use"" that is their claim to fame. It took me hours upon hours of trying to decipher Apple's cryptic and inaccurate error messages to get to the bottom of it.So here's my advice to buyers: The iPod Photo 30GB comes with a cord that connects it to your computer's USB 2.0 port. MAKE SURE your USB 2.0 ports are what Apple calls ""Windows Certified"". I had just bought a BRAND NEW (and not cheap) Firewire/USB 2.0 card for my PC, and the USB 2.0 ports on this card do NOT work with iPod. If your USB ports are like mine, you'll need to go buy an iPod-to-Firewire cord (it doesn't come with this unit). That, or you'll need to upgrade your USB 2.0 ports."
1,HELLO,"Theres some problems with it...Software isent that good, lots problems,I hate usb port carger, runs down Laptop batteries faster"
4,IPOD Color 30,This player has enough features to keep you satisfied. The best thing about it is the quality.
1,Beware of iTunes - Poor Quality and locks you to Apple,"Previous reviews describes the HW. Not much to add here: Slick design, easy to understand, undersized screen for photo but the colors are nice.The problem with Apple is the iTunes SW. Unlike other MP3 software I have seen, this one works only with iPod which gives you two problems: You will be locked to iPod and it may not work.- If you have loaded 10.000 songs (no small task)onto iTunes and want to use it with another player then it's back to reloading. It will not work with other players. Also, Playlists are to be maintained multiple places etc.- iTunes has sigificant quality problems so your perfectly working computer may not work with it. Go to http://discussions.info.apple.com and check it out - and note how many problems are unsolved so folks are sitting there unable to load, burn and play and the proprietary nature of iTunes means that there are no alternatives. Customer support is at best randomI got one iPod. My last."
1,Shoddy product,"It did not work. From first time. I could not start, It did not charge.Pure aggrevation."
4,Ipod 30G Photo,"I have a first generation Ipod, and decided it was time to upgrade. The ability to save photo's without a PC was key.the Ipod ships with a USB cable. Now, I have friends using the USB cable with no problem, but, the ipod would not recognize for me (I use a Belkin USB/firewire card). It would recognize in another PC using Usb 1.1. In looking at Apple's discussion forums, I wasn't the only one with USB issues. I went to the Apple store, picked up a Firewire cable, and it worked like a champ. I wish Apple wouldn't even bundle a cable, and let the user pick up the cable they need. I now have a USB cable that is useless for me. Other than that, this thing ROCKS!"
2,it's just OK,"This was my first I Pod ever and first apple product, i was not impressed with the service i received. I bought apple care thankfully! My I pod broke a month after i bought it had some sort of malfunction and erased all my songs and wouldn't upload them anymore i took it to apple and they ""fixed"" it and then a month later it just stopped working and i was given a new I pod then that one has messed up a few times refusing to turn on and such. I feel like I should have waited until they had all the kinks ironed out. My battery life also is also totall poo.I love the color screenI love the song art"
3,Okay,"I just finished reading this book and I have to say, that although I'm pretty sure he killed his wife, I don't think the state had much evidence. They kept referring to him drawing his wife's bathwater. What is so bizarre about that? My husband draws my bathwater for me more than I do! I hope to heck that if I ever fall and hurt myself in the bathtub, people don't blame my husband if he says he drew my bathwater! The only trouble I had with his innocence is the amount of bruising she suffered in the ""fall"". But otherwise, if it weren't for that, I would have to say I'm not sure he did it."
4,A Exciting Book!,"Breaking Rank was a very good book. It was interesting and very exciting right till the end. It had alot of Symbolism and showed alot about how people act when others are just a little different. It showed how once you get to know someone you could become friends with them or even more. The end of Breaking Rank was a little disapointing to me because the whole book had so much going on and when they end it the way they did it just killed the book a little bit. It wasnt the ending I was hoping for, and that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the ending. Besides the end of the book which I didnt prefer it was an excellent book and is a great book to read in schools."
4,this is a great book,"I thought this book was awsome.The author made it so realistic.I never thought i would like it.Thomas(Baby)was my favorite.Some of the book i didnt like ,but most of it I did.Many people automatically judge you based on how you look.I know someone like that.So I have to say that children and adults should read this ."
4,stogolosu,"I learned very quickly with this program and my pronunciation is incredible. I worked at a Greek restaurant and they were thoroughly impressed with my accent and for the fact that I did not speak in a vulgar fashion. I have had no prior experience speaking any Greek and due to this book and the audio cassettes I speak wonderfully.I only have one negative point to make about this program and that is you need to really pay attention to the alphabet. Relatively early in the book it converts completely to Greek with no English to help you out. I had to stop my constant studying because the alphabet gave me serious problems. I simply could not read Greek, but I could say a ton! But...for what I did study I still know like the back of my hand. The repetitive structure drills it into you where you will not forget it. I give it 4 stars:)"
2,Some major deficiences,"I know how frustrating it is to find good material to learn Greek; therefore, I am sorry to say that this book/tape combo has major problems. The first problem, as has been noted in previous reviews, is the print, which looks as if it was photocopied from a typescript circa the 1950s. Hard to read.But the second, more serious problem, is with the spelling, including the use of accents. This book has not been updated to the new, monotonic system of accents. In addition, old spellings (e.g., the use of [eeta] for -ei in the subjunctive) are used.If you are using this series primarily for the audio content, these problems will be less apparent."
1,Disappointing,"I have recently moved to Greece and purchased this book and audio tape set to help me learn Greek.The main problem is the layout of the book. It looks like each page has been typed on a manual typewriter then photocopied. The print is poor and at times, impossible to read and there are also spelling mistakes.It is not an easy book to follow and doesn't make learning the language an easy task. The English language used is complex and not in laymans terms for the average indiviual, making learning the language a chore.The Greek vocabulary lists contain words that are not translated into English alongside and when shown to a native, they weren't even sure of some of the words themselves! The speed of the conversation on the audio tapes is also very fast and difficult to follow with no symbols in the book to advise when the tape should be usedI needed an easy to follow, step by step course in basic Greek, but unfortunatley this package did not suit my needs. Very disappointing."
1,Mastering Greek,As a student of languages I have found the physical print and form of this book very difficult to follow.....the translation from Greek to English did not follow the script......and requires constant review to enable the student to build a vocabulary that is useful and the follow up conversational aspects lacks discipline......The 1988 edition perhaps is good for 1988...but unlike wine that matures in taste.This book is close to turning to a taste of vinegar.I would like any recommendations that anyone has as an alternative to this course.....Thanks
4,See No Evil,"These were perfect for my niece. They are pricey for their size, but they were a great gift. Loved them!"
5,Moorehead is Simply Marvelous,"For those who think of the great Agnes Moorehead only as ""Endora"" from ""Bewitched,"" then, they have not experienced the range of one of film's most capable character actresses. ""The Invaders"" offers the actress the chance to have a field day as a seemingly mute farmwoman whose home has been invaded by Lilliputian visitors from ""out there."" With a gloriously effective Jerry Goldsmith score, this classic episode not only has bravura acting from Moorehead, but the ingenious use of puppets and miniatures, along with interesting camera angles and lighting.The end ""revelation"" is still a shocker!It doesn't matter which episode is paired with this one, as is ""Nothing in Dark."" ""The Invaders"" is an investment worth making on its own."
3,The Invaders looks silly now,"I watched a different tape - which had the Invaders but not Nothing in Dark.The Invaders is a good acting performance and it is interesting but SSLLOOWW and a little silly looking now. Little versions of the robot from lost in space attacking this woman with little flashlights and a carving knife??? For it's time it was probably good, but not now - in my opinion."
5,Bo Diddley-The Definitive Collection,"Bo Diddley invented his own sound-and that's a hard thing to do. His African rhythms are a cornerstone of Rock and Roll. This collection shows how diverse he was. Anyone who had their songs covered by Eric Clapton, George Thorogood, and The New York Dolls had to be on to something!"
1,Another corporate rip-off,"Track for track (even the order of the tracks) is identical to ""His Best"" - don't be fooled and buy what you already have"
2,Misled on the Yellow Brick Road,I found that Morena has misled her readers into thinking that this is a book about OZ; especially since she is a relative of the creator. But it really talks about her interest in play/sandbox therapy. I am not interested in that so I felt disappointed with the book.
2,flawed recording of great artist,"when i was a teenager i had the highest esteem for alirio diaz, whom i admired more than segovia and almost as much as julian bream. unfortunately this disc is disappointing because of very poor engineering. the recording is bottom heavy, yet the high registers are badly distorted in forte passages. the balance from one piece to the next varies widely, as if assembled from different recording sessions -- even the balance within a single piece is not consistent. it sounds as if the disc was acoustically miked from an lp record. the playing is generally superb and sometimes spectacular, but there are also many flubs, buzzes and squeaks. for guitar fanatics this is an important historical testament, but for music lovers the three recordings originally released on vanguard records and also available on cd are the better choices."
5,Alirio Diaz is a national treasure!,"The main feature that distinguishes this outstanding guitarrist is that sheer lyricism and overwhelming musicality, the way he conveys the listener into the particular univwerse of every work he plays.It's useless to state the whole virtuosism, astonishing vitality and warm tune of this notable interpreter. Five centuries of the guitar demonstrate by far the kaleidoscopic flight and the enormous talent of this national pride, master of masters.Don't miss this record."
3,heart talks for every day themes for every day people,"I purchased this book for each of my kids. Their Great Great Grandfather wrote it. I was thrilled to find out it was being reprinted. I already have the book, a much older version, but mine has over 350 pages. I was very disappointed when I got this book and found it only had 80 some pages. I paid a lot of money for only a small portion of a book. I returned the books and ordered the complete book elsewhere. The complete book is awesome. I am sure the small version is fine, but not when you have the real thing. It actually was my fault, it was advertised as being only 80 some pages, I just didn't realize I needed to look at the size of the book. It didn't dawn on me that it wouldn't be the same."
5,Great Product!,"Loved this hand creme! Even worked for my mother-in-law who is allergic to chemical fragrances. Keeps hands soft and smells WONDERFUL, just like tea rose."
3,Easy Grip,Worked fine until the screw fell apart. The grip becomes loose and you have to keep adjusting the screw. Very expensive for an item that does not hold up very well.
4,Just what Grandma needed,"I bought this for my grandma who has a hard time getting in and out of the tub. It was easy to install and is very sturdy. My grandma finds it very useful. It is prone to a little superficial rusting, but it is only cosmetic and due to the fact that grandma can't see and clean everything so well anymore."
2,You need know about the subject to understand the book,"You need to understand the subject to understand the book. But if you already understand the subject, why do you need to read the book?Poorly organized and written. Theorems based on terms are given before the definitions are supplied. The introductory example doesn't explain what is going on.2 stars: read if you need the subject and this is the only book on the subject; but otherwise read something rated at least 3."
2,"Hard to read, lacks clarity","Boy, this book is HARD to read for somebody without a PhD in Statistics. The language oftentimes is far from clear. Examples and explanations are not obvious at all. The author makes a lot of implicit assumptions. I had to get a few other books on Bayesian networks in order to understand author's explanations."
2,A lot about very little,"The book covers many topics, but doesn't really cover them well. I would not recommend this book. I have learned litte from it."
1,Words cannot describe...,"This book has literally been the worst book I have ever read. It's sitting as I type in my trash can because I refuse to curse anyone by giving it away.... Don't waste your money. If you still want to read it, get it from the library."
1,terminal tragedy,"thIS books[abominations] banckruptcy of ideas IN sham COMEDY, MAKE for AWFULL AWKWARDNESS,of lonliness within the bottle SPIRALdrown he wrote. the PSUEDO wierdo, there were three , just hurt me to read, HOW shallow,SHRILL and desperate,NO matter he rebounded eventually, goes to show what alcohol CAN DO to ONCE GOOD writer,"
4,This Dude is cool,"Max is my homeslice. He goes to my school and he is a talented musician and mean Ultimate frisbee player. From having seen Max play at numerous events, I'm gonna say he is one of the best Hammer-dulcimer players you could imagine. Buy his album.He did a soundtrack for a sketch that my group produced. See it here:oldeenglish.org/newvideos/leaf.movand be sure to check out the other funny stuff at OldeEnglish.org!"
4,The Real Watership Down,"Richard Adams never would of wrote ""Watership Down"" had it not been for R. M. Lockley's ""The Private Life of the Rabbit."" This is the first time someone has truly studied rabbit behavior. As far as discoveries go, Lockely is to rabbits as Jane Goodall is to the chimpanzees of Gombe.Lockley explains migrations of yearlings, chin glands, chewing pellets, re-absorption of embryos and other points of Lapine life. Though written in 1964 this is a good edition to add to any rabbit library. This book is the roots of our understanding of wild and domestic rabbit behavior."
3,Hmm,"It is nice for an old book. It smells like grandma's, and it's about rabbits.The information is old and outdated.Grand."
4,Old TV shows,"I love many of the old television shows that were on. They were suggestive but proper, not like television today. The Beverly Hillbillies is a classic show on how to maintain culture even among the non-cultured. Jed and his family create some of the most spectacular circumstances just out of plain ol' simplicity. And it's this simple humor that makes the Hillbillies a timeless classic. I hope the other seasons are released soon."
3,Just finished watching a few episodes....,"I just picked this up and watched the first couple of episodes. Don't get me wrong; I'm extremely happy that this series is available on DVD; but I thought this is worth mentioning. It does indeed look like these episodes are shown in their entirety, but some of the scenes look like they were not re-mastered.In the first episode on disk one; ""Jed Becomes A Movie Mogul""; in the scene after Jane Hathaway tells Jed that he now owns the movie studio; as she drives away in her car the picture looks very grainy with numerous scratches. I noticed it again later in the episode; when the Clampetts drive their truck to the studio.But in all fairness; it doesn't mention on the package that this set was re-masteredI'll finish watching all the episodes and give more details....."
5,Loved the Beverly Hillbillies: The Official Third Season,"I love the Beverly Hillbillies, and the Official Third Season did not disappoint. I play these over and over, especially when I want to relax, or to laugh. Just wondering when the rest of the Hillbillies series will be out. One comment..I don't appreciate Granny in her Southern hat on the menu page. We need to be a little more sensitive to those whose ancestors were subjected to slavery in the south. I don't really find any prejudice in the episodes, so don't know why that picture was chosen."
3,Great for non-biology majors lacking otherwise,"There are two glowing reviews of this book but I wanted to offer a different perspective ofFundamentals of Conservation Biology. This is my second round teaching Conservation Biology at the college level. Last year I used Groom's textPrinciples of Conservation Biology, Third Editionbut this was too advanced and would make a great graduate-level book. This year I'm using Hunter and Gibbs and my students are finding it lacking. If only I could take the two books and create a book that is an average between the two. Hunter and Gibbs would be ideal for a conservation biology course for non-majors but for students that had ecology and ecology-related courses."
5,The Ride of their Lives,this is a great DVD. We have followed Richard Petty's career since the early 60's and this was a great addition to our collection of DVD about him. Great action shots and lots of racing going on and we loved it
3,A good NASCAR documentary,"If you're not familiar with the history of NASCAR or just getting into the sport. This is one of the best DVDs out there to help you understand how everything got started in the NASCAR world. Almost everything you want to know about NASCAR is mentioned in this DVD, though I think if it was longer they could've put in more about how NASCAR came about since 1948. I give this 3 stars out of 5."
4,Better than Most,"This is one of several books of the type; a general overview of the sport/hobby of cycling. Aimed at the beginner, it nevertheless provides maintenance, training, nutrition, and gear types for any level of rider. I found that this one offered a bit more than usual (at this level) in the physical training category. Like most DK books, the photography is bright, sharp, and abundant. Offers a specific training program (hence the title) if you are interested in following it, but the info is generally helpful for the freelancer. Worthwhile if you are looking for getting into biking."
3,A grab bag of old stuff,"This is one of those ""various artists"" CDs formed by stringing snatches of old recordings together. One track, supposedly a medley, seems to have been created by splicing two Frankie Yankovic tapes from the 1950s. I remember that track from a... vinyl LP, by unidentified artists, from about 1970. It's not all that bad, though. At least the recording quality is decent. And ""Little Green Men Polka"" has some funny lyrics and a catchy tune."
3,Polish Polkas and Other Favorites,Nice lively polkas. Some of the music is a little diferent than the way you hear it played localy. It was still enjoyable to hear authentic music being played. Check it out.
2,Polka CD,"I have many other CD's that I prefer to this one. Wasn't what I expected or should I say, wasn't to my musical taste."
5,Well Written and Disturbing,"This book is pretty well written, with only a few minor complaints. First some of the region specific killers are missing such as John Norman Collins, but over all is very complete. The addition of a quick reference guide in the back that explains both solved and unsolved cases is a nice touch.This book along with Harold Schecters Serial Killer Files make a fairly complete analysis of the more deranged and sociopathic killers out there.I recommend this book to anyone curious about some of the most despicable people out there."
3,Short straight Informative,"If you want to learn the in's and out's of serial killer files, this is not the book. what it is good for is its wide range of SK's with brief but informative information regarding each one mentioned, as well as some other useful terms often associated with SK's or detective work and forensics. Its more like a dictionary than a true encyclopaedia. However it is still interesting. I would like to see a more in depth edition, with much more research."
3,"Clean. No guts, blood, pain, or suffering.",It is written like an encyclopedia! Hahaha.It was a good simple easy read lots of basic facts.If your looking for those shockinng details. You are not going to get it here.The x-ray of albeit fich pelvis with the needle insterts was pretty interesting. Not much else.
5,classroom favorite,I have this puzzle in my classroom and the children (five year olds) constantly form waiting lists for completing it. No matter how many times they look at it in a dark corner they want to see it glow again.
4,A Detective First?,"The miserly and generally nasty Lemuel Shackford is found murdered, and his cousin Richard is accused. Richard works for the Slocum Marble Yard and is in love with Margaret Slocum, the owner's daughter. Richard eventually proves his innocence and all is well. This novel is believed to be the first in which a detective appears, and, interestingly, he gets it all wrong (he thinks Richard is guilty). Richard and Margaret are a bit too good, and why Richard would want his cousin's blessing for his upcoming marriage (Shackford is murdered right after this heated meeting and helps point the finger at Richard) is hard to believe. But Aldrich writes in a straightforward, realistic style that makes the book an interesting and enjoyable reading experience."
4,Nice but not perfect,"Product looks great, and fit's good but fitment isn't perfect. No one else would notice, but they could be a little more precise in the design to fit better up against the tailgate.Installed on a 2010 Escalade"
5,Fror All Dinosaur Lovers,"I purchased this for my 4 year old son, right now he is going thru the dinosaur stage - loves anything dinosaur. He loves these DVDs - watches them over and over and he has learned so many dinoasur names and terminology. I got my money's worth with this buy!"
4,Jurassic Fight Club: Season One,"I hope that the viewer has the patience to stay with the series through the first half to the second half; it is worth it. In the first half, ""Dinosaur George"" Blasing is annoying as a paleontologist-wannabee constantly intruding on what would otherwise be above average entertainment; a larger-than-life drama king trumpeting fiction as if it were all scientific fact like some snake-oil salesman hawking his product as a cure for everything under the sun. I am most concerned that younger viewers would not be able to seperate his gyrating quest for ratings from legitimate scientific findings. Fortunately, the series evolves to where ""Dinosaur George"" is merely annoying. In the second half of the season, he tones it down, avoiding profering the various scenarios as proven blow-by-blow confrontations. The special effects evolved as well. What started as slightly above average became truly impressive footage that was often noteworthy and occasionally breath-taking."
2,It's Dinosaurs fighting you don't need the hyperbole,"There's about 10 minutes of really essential stuff in each episode, some good CGI and informed opinion. The rest is hyperbolic filler. More science and less tinsel would have made this a great deal more watchable."
3,"Just not enough dinosaur ""footage""","Interesting information and theories, but not enough action for my dino-loving toddler. Would have liked to see more dinosaur ""footage."""
2,"Dinosaurs, yes, humans NO","To me the ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" series is still the greatest, this one is not on the same level. Yes the CGI effects are awsome, what I object to are the numerous, repetitive and frankly boring commentaries. They should have used only a voice over instead of going back and forth between the animation and those...well, scientists. If I had known beforehand I would not have bought these dvd's and I'll probably will not view them again.Sorry."
1,Garbage,"I am a professional paleontologist and I have to say it is a shame dinosaurs are being used for such a trash show. We have very little knowledge about dinosaur behavior, yet this series is showing a lot of speculation based on very little evidence. Plus, the ""paleontologist"" hosting this travesty is not even a professional, he is just a dork looking for a way to make a living out of story-telling. Horrendous!"
2,"Great facts, but in a pure accounting manner","Great listing of facts and details about Tudor England, for example how many butchers worked in London and where their waste went. It is a very detail-oriented, accounting-like list of information ranging from everyday items used to road repairs and its implications for the time it took to deliver documents. Not very insightful as to Tudor history itself and a bit biased, as the author clearly states that Henry VIII was the greatest king England ever had, but Elizabeth I was basically a poor queen, indecisive and any decisions were done by her advisors. Interesting as to the details that one is not likely to find anywhere else."
1,Lacks focus,"Mr. Ridley wanders about more than the Countess of Salisbury when she went to the block. Why he spent over a page on this in the Chapter on Houses I am not sure. The entire book is filled with historical information which is interesting, but in many cases is related only by a thin thread to the subject at hand. This book could only be used as a history of the Tudor age if it was used with another more complete history. It is too broad and the trivia he provides doesn't fill in the holes. On the other hand, it reads well so if you want some light history reading, its ok."
3,INTERESTING READ... BUT A BIT WANDERING,"interesting read... details of life in the tudor age from the local butcher on up to the priesthood and royalty... a lot of detail about the upper crust, but not much about the day to day of the common folk... would have loved to have read about schooling, healthcare, passtimes, music, how people spent their leisure time... what we get for the most part is royal history, which is interesting in itself but not why i picked up the book and not what i believe the intent of the book was... off course i could be wrong, that's why 3 and not 2 stars"
2,"GOOD IDEA, COULD BE BETTER","The format is very good for kids who thrive in two languages, as songs are played back to back in English and Spanish. I only have three pounds of beef with the product: First, singers' quality. The choir could hardly be more out of key. Another is that Spanish translations for typical English songs are terrible. They do not rhyme at all (see? rhyme = rima), and often a complete and often nonsensical sentence is hurriedly squeezed into a sigle song line. Lastly, the patronizing final line in the video (it is important that parents view this video with their children or sometihng to that effect) is read in Spanish only. Why is this? is there an assumption that Spanish speaking parents, not the English language-only ones plug their kids to the tube and go on with their merry lives? I don't see this kind of patronizing in English language videos, nor this line is read also in English too following it."
3,Poor translation and not a native speaker,"Although we loved the Cantarima Nursery Rhyme DVD, this one was very disappointing. The format is good - being brought up bilingual myself, I strongly believe the best way for kids to learn a language is through nursery rhymes and singing. My main irritation with it is the poor translation and the accent. If I am going to put a bilingual DVD or CD, I expect a native speaker. The accent was terrible. A complete put-off. Also as someone else has said, far too hurried for language learning and I compensate by repeating the dialog or song myself slowly and clearly. I admit that I do put it on because my kids enjoy it and I want maximum exposure, and the DVD is a huge improvement on most of the bilingual material out there - but still a disappointment."
1,This is awful!!!!,"I listened to the first 3 minutes of this DVD and had to turn it off because the kids are signing off key and not even with the music. It's terrible. I don't want my newborn to think that this is what music sounds like. Luckily, I got this from the library and didn't spend a dime on it. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS...unless your child is deaf...or you want your child to be tone deaf."
2,"Nice collection, but...","This collection of exciting arrangements wonderfully executed by professional players is unfortunately marred by old technology and carelessness. The short, twenty nine minute CD seems to be copied from an LP. The pops, clicks, distortion and glitches are all there. At one point you can even hear the annoying pitch wow commonly heard on LPs pressed out of round. The tone arm is obviously being dragged right and then left as the off center groove dictates the key.Should Legacy International ever locate the master tapes and produce a cleaner version of ""Circus Music from the Big Top,"" I will be first in line to buy. Frankly, Merle Evans deserves better--much better.If you are adding to a collection of circus music, you do need these arrangements. However, if you are just beginning a circus music library, your first purchase should be ""Screamers"" from Frederick Fennell. It delivers over an hour of expertly performed circus marches recorded with precision."
1,Worthless -- not helpful to me at all,"We just adopted a 12 year old girl and I was looking for additional activities/rituals to strengthen our family ties. This book sure didn't help. I thought, ok, here it is Christmas, what are some other things we can do...? What I didn't need was a historical look at the Christmas holiday and the unspoken ""rules"" of gift giving. I skimmed some of the other chapters and they were not much better--and geared for younger children anyway. It's more about how to make X go better--bedtime, vacation, birthdays--and very obvious ideas to boot. But no ideas really on special ""rituals"" or special moments to build on in the years to come. Absolutely worthless book for my needs."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,Beware! Just because it's a DVD doesn't automatically mean the image quality is good. Do not buy these DVDs. They are a waste of money. There are many wonderful restorations of early silent cinema by Film Preservation Associates and David Shepard and others. These are the farthest things from it. The DVD transfer made from wretched prints with ridiculous music accompaniment. They should be ashamed!
1,"""The Chaplin Collection"" fails to deliver","""The Chaplin Collection"" serves as an unfortunate reminder of what happens to classic films once their copyrights expire, and not-so-reputable publishers move in to take advantage of unsuspecting consumers. Poor production value and a genuinely amateurish package all around are made even worse by images so poor as to make the collection almost unbearable to watch. The memory of Charlie Chaplin and his cinematic genius deserve better. Avoid at all cost."
1,I do NOT recommend this DVD to buy,Please do not buy this collection. Quality as well as the Movies are not good to see/enjoy. Pls don't buy.
2,A bissele shvakh,"The Barry Sisters are pretty good on this but the selections are mostly 2nd rate. They have better material - why isn't ""Yidl Mitn Fiedl"" on this?"
4,Excellent collection,"An excellent CD with a wonderfull collection of exquisite Jewish folksongs. Barry Sisters are singing their best. You can find a song that will match any mood of yours. Unfortunately, some of their VERY best songs are not included. Fortunately, the double-CD version has them."
2,Loud!,I've had my minimax drive for about a month and at first it was fairly quiet but now it'ss much louder than my macmini. I often turn it off and the lack of the whining/whizing noise is sucha relief. Even though this HD looks great under my mini I would not buy it again
3,Too heavily perfumed,"This vitamin e cream was a great price, is made in the USA, and goes on nicely, but the fragrance is overpowering. I ended up throwing it away. Wish they had an unscented version."
5,Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E Cream,I added this to my purchase of the lotion. This product to me is OK.. the cream feels nice but it is not good to use it on your face .
5,Great Value,"This product is an amazing moisturizer, without a heavy perfume scent. It is thick but soaks in quickly, and is great for dry winter skin (or anytime of the year)."
2,not a fan of mineral oil,"had I known this product included mineral oil i would not have made the purchase. not only because mineral oil is NOT a natural ingredient (it's petroleum based), but the jury is out on how good it is for our skin; soak a saltine cracker in mineral oil overnight.anyway, I LOVE that this product is made in the USA and the ""value"" of it, but for me, I would NOT buy it again.Further, I was expecting a gel, and it was a white cream. Probably my mistake.I got wrapped up in the great reviews, so I wanted to follow up w/ my own in case other people out there were/ are like me."
1,Displeased.,"I was looking for a product that only included natural ingredients. This product does not have ALL natural ingredients. In the ingredients section ( which they do not advertise on the selling page) there is perfume, cetyl alcohol, and other products I can not pronounce. It is not all natural. I have very sensitive skin with excema problems when I use products that have alcohol in them.Also - to return the item, they make you pay the shipping fee. I basically have spent 6 dollars total just to find out the product is not what it advertised online and to return it. I would have liked to know that the product included OTHER ingredients. They only mention vitamin e, aloe vera, wheat germ, sunflower seed oil, collagen and elastin.Not pleased."
5,Fruit if the Earth is the best !!!,I have been using Fruit of the Earth for a few months now as a night cream and to see if it might lighten a brown sun spot I have on my face and I have to say this stuff is amazing !!! My brown spot is alittle lighter so now I can cover it with makeup and my skin is so soft. I love this stuff and I use it twice a day morning and night. I have also noticed that is helps with cracked heals. 5 STARS all the way !
5,It just works!,"I was visiting my mom while on vacation and had left my Vitamin E cream at home. I have painfully dry, cracked heels and soles, to the point I can't wear socks in the winter unless I glob on a good, rich cream first. I was using a Bath & Body Works foot cream until it got too expensive for my budget, so I'd switched to a store brand.My mom brought out a jar of this Fruit of the Earth cream which she'd gotten for a dollar at a local discount store. I'd never heard of it, but what a surprise. I couldn't believe how much it softened my feet, almost to the point of eliminating the cracks & splits in my skin in just 5 days. We couldn't find it again in local stores, so I'm glad to have found it online.I probably wouldn't have bought this product otherwise, because I don't even see the Vit E units mentioned on the jar so I'm guessing it's a small amount. Whatever is in the mix, though, it just works...better than the 28,000 units Vitamin E cream I'd used previously."
1,Arms & chest are covered in rash,"I bought this based on all of the reviews that say how great this stuff is and better yet, how wonderful it is for the money. I have been using this cream for about a week and a half and my arms and chest where I have applied it are covered in a red rash. I do admit I have sensitive skin but have used tons of other lotions, creams, etc. and they have never done this. I bought 4 jars of this stuff but I will never use it again. Sorry for the negative review but I am just being completely honest."
4,love it!,"I'm only 18, but I have been using this cream for over three years now after first picking it up at wal-mart. I have seriously troubled skin thanks to years of acne and the topical lotions I had to put on them. I've found that this stuff helped to smooth out my skin and that it kept it very moisturized. I plan on using this in the future too because it doesn't break me out & it is seriously cheap. My complaint is that it does make my skin a bit red. The redness lasts several hours after application. Thus, I can only apply this at night, shortly before going to bed. When I wake up in the morning, however, my skin looks dewy and wonderful! Also, it refuses to fully absorb into my skin, leaving an oily residue on the surface which I can literally rub off with my fingers...sounds bad but the plus side of this cream more then makes up for it!"
4,Very good,"Feels like I've spent a month or two or three with Clarissa, traipsing the countryside shooting game, getting away with antics in law school, and of course cooking!"
5,the title says it all,"I've been on a sort of Roots bender of late. When it comes to Rock -n- Roll, this is where the roots are."
3,So authentic it's false,"Frat-boy, roadhouse blues. Rare instances of real feeling. Principally interesting historically. Doubt that I'll listen to this very often. Prefer Junior Wells, even Muddy Waters."
5,Howlin Wolf delivers,"we recently went to Rock and Roll Hall and Fame and my husband loved this music...if you like raw blues, this is for you."
5,perfect and fast,"what can you say about the wolf you can almost see him stalking the stage, harp in hand and wailing the blues"
3,fahrenheit 451,this book can be somewhat confusing. if you are new to the english language i would advise against reading this book
2,Spa and Kiddie Vacuum,"The spa and kiddie vacuum was very simple to put together but not very durable, the handle broke the first time i used it, although it did vacuum the pool well and cleaning the bag was easy."
3,Cheap Handle,"The vacume works great, however the handle is a cheap piece of crap I would recommend right from the start getting out the duct tape and re-inforcing the handle the first time you go to pull it out of the pool its gonna break!!"
1,Total waste of money & frustration,"Don't waste your money. Mine broke 2 days after the 1 yr warranty ran out. I never dropped or abused it...it just froze. I spent hours trying every ""fix"" available. Nothing worked. Apple support was no help-basically said ""tough luck"". The store where it was purchased would do nothing either.This was a very expensive piece of trash. I will never buy another apple product."
3,ipod review,"I have a problem with the library system and the fact that 5 days after buying this in Sept, the new video ipod came out. You cannot have your ipod really work on 2 computers. I have a work computer and a home computer, apple treats their customers like already potential thieves about music sharing.Or have mulitiple iPods in one household. Plus the hardware is a beautiful design, but so easily scratched and damaged. I would like to hear if anyone knows how to install video watching software on this type of ipod."
5,IPOD's Rock,"This is a wonderful item to have, just because it is so small yets holds so much. Plus the battery life is better than you would expect out of it too. I use mine all the time and am glad to gotten it when I did. Aside from the unit scratching really easy (just buy a case) it is good to go. Easy to use, and great results make this item a buy!"
5,Bigger is better,"After how ever many tries, Apple put the monster in play. The 60 gig is the only way to go. All other ipods will eventually fill up and you will be left with no space. No doubt some of you are seriously considering the new NANO, but just say NO to NANO. Size does matter, and you will never have to worry about buying another mp3 player again. (unless, of course, the NANO hits the 60 gig mark. If that happens, I fear the world will end...)"
5,its what i ordered,"the company sent me a great product, at a great price. im glad there is an ebay to shop around for great deals."
3,Why isn't there an exchange program,"I bought my Ipod Photo two weeks before the introduction of the video Ipod. I like the Photo, but feel that Apple is not taking care of its customers. They seem to be saying, ""let the customer beware"" because they will do an update at any time and leave you with your old technology with no remorse. This is a warning to future purchasers of their products. They will not take care of their customers."
1,Make sure you get the protection plan!,"Just a heads up to whoever is buying an iPod. Make sure you figure the cost of the protection plan into the cost of the iPod. If your iPod fails after the warranty expires (mine failed two weeks after the end of the warranty period), it is essentially worthless. Apple's only service option is to send them the failed unit and $255 + tax and they will send you a USED (no guarantee it is even refurbished) replacement with a 90 day warranty. In other words you are far better off just buying a new one when the old one fails. Makes the $60 protection plan sound really good."
1,Would be great if it worked...,"In theory it would be a great product, except that my first iPod of this model had its hard drive go bad only a few months after I got it. Apple replaced it, great process, but now the replacement has gone bad after less than a year. And of course now the warranty has passed. Poorly built, dodgy model. Don't waste your money."
4,60 GB iPod Photo,"Although a bit pricey, the iPod photo is worth the money. You'll never find yourself getting worried about how much space is left for songs. There is so much free space that you are able to listen to high quality music without fear of filling up the capacity. The player also acts as a mobile storage device carrying any type of media or files you wish.The only thing I don't like about the photo iPod is the ease of use in the photo settings. If you want to present a slideshow with music to someone on a tv, you are not able to skip thru songs while viewing photos; you must create a playlist of songs before starting the slideshow, otherwise the song restarts. Also, I wish the iPod was password protected so you can keep your files safe from being viewed if you misplace or lose the device."
5,iPod 60GB,"I've used the iPod 60GB as a travel hard drive that I use to store digital images. I found it to be very fast with the optional fire wire connection cable and very stable--it always works and had no difficulty taking 30 Gigs of images. It's noiseless, had excellent design features, and is powered through the comptuer--another words 'invisible' when it should be. I have no hesitation in recommending this product."
5,"""iPod Goes to College""","While my attempts to have my 18 year-old college-bound son look at other players were futile - I however (the paying parent) did do much research. And yes there are many options out there for large HD-based players. But when it came down to it he WANTED the iPod. Because I suppose it IS an iPod. That said, the unit performs flawlessly integrating as advertised with iTunes. It sounds great even with the rather mundane headphones. (It sounds even better with the Bose docking system he also received for graduation!)The 60GB HD is huge. Filled with 1,000's of songs already it is barely filled. My only hope now is that he spends as much time studying as he has setting up his iPod (and new notebook PC- but that of course is a whole different story). Yes, I agree Apple should be a bit more competitive with pricing and include other accessories (fire wire, some type of cover, etc.) but I suppose until the real iPod ""killer"" comes along they don't have to!"
4,good purchase,"It's a good item, the only problem is that it gets scratched verry easy. Amazon should recomend a though skin guard at the time of purchase."
1,Great iPod .....but,"I bought my iPod Photo 60GB last week and it gave me a lot of problems from the start. I charged the battery for over 5 hrs until fully charged and 5 mins later the ipod was telling me to charge again saying the battery was empty. I got a new replacement within 3 days and charge the battery to full. The next day I was listening to my ipod for almost 2hrs & 15 mins and the battery icon was down to red meaning the battery was almost empty. This didn't make me happy at all when the ipod was suppose to last anywhere from 12-15 hrs. I will return the 2nd ipod I got from Amazon. Too bad....I really wanted to keep it, but with the battery trouble....I'm returning it."
1,Rubbish battery again,Battery lasts 5 hours if played immediately after charging. Loses 50% charge after 5 hours switched off. Loses 100% charge left switched off for 24 hours.During tests the equaliser was off - backlight set 10 secs - was on HOLD. One long playlist selection time less then 30 secs. Battery fully recharged before each test.Amazon are brilliant and have sent a replacement immediately.It is annoying that Mr. Jobs cannot learn after his serial quality problems causing inconvenience all over the place.
3,60 GB?!?,"When I first saw this thing I immediatly thought ""60 GB? You gotta be kidding me!""This little player has as big a hard drive as my computer. You will most likely never ever even come close to filling it, and if you do, I recommend you get a life, because there is no way anyone should have 60 GB of music. But I digress. This is an amazing piece of electronics, and if you have the money to spend, and absolutely must have it so that you can brag to your friends that your ipod has more space than their computer, then go ahead, but most people don't need one this big."
5,IPOD 60 Gig,"Great item, I wish taht it was larger. Works well in my truck no more Cds. I have it wired direct in my truck and the sound is awesome."
4,Useful and adorable,"I own both the frog and the dog models of this potholder. I use them both all the time and absolutely love them. Not only are they adorable and great conversation-starters, but they're useful too. I scored them 4 stars instead of 5 because, like other silicone potholders and pads, the heat bleeds through fairly quickly. Additionally, because of the eyes on the frog and the ears on the dog, they don't fit very well in shallow kitchen drawers and the eyes / ears tend to get caught. The two models do nest together, however."
2,Too small,"Doesn't cover your whole hand. Only to your knuckles. The picture is misleading. The material is fine. I'm sure it could hold up to the heat, but what's the point if there's still a risk of burning the top of your hand and wrist if you take something off of the top rack in the oven?"
2,WAY smaller than the picture,"I bought this for my sister-in-law, who loves frogs. It seemed perfect, but was not what I expected. The picture here was well-done in hiding the flaws. The hand is angled so it looks like the mitt covers the whole hand nearly to the wrist. However, it only covers to the knuckles at best. If you have big hands, it won't even go down that far. If you are buying this to protect your hands from heat, you'd best keep looking. It covers so little of the hand that I wouldn't feel safe putting it into a hot oven as my only protection."
5,Kids love this,"I bought this as a bath toy for a 1yr and 3yr-old. They love it, in or out of the bath. Nice that it's dishwasher safe."
5,Comfortable,"This is a comfortable pair of boots. They are insulated as shown in the photos (the stamp). The only thing I am not liking it the... hooks(?) for the lace in the upper section is rough, needs a little filing and it is better then great!I would not know how these will fair as a work boot though."
3,NOT EXACTLY DESCRIBED,"I ordered this 6"" boot, only to find that it is an insulated pair their selling. Nowhere in the description does it tell you this. And being in the middle of summer I will not wear them. They are comfortable though."
5,Awesome show for a great price,"This show is amazing, you get two seasons for the price of one with this package deal. This show has action and some mystery. This show is entertaining and clever. Must buy"
3,Songs for Shuttered Parlours and Smoky Rooms,"I agree with Brian Watson's review. Elsa Lancester is great. It's a shame this CD isn't. It seems to have been put together by people who didn't understand what made her special. The songs are a mixture of temperance and music hall songs researched in the British Library by Lanchester for her shows at the Cave of Harmony in London in the 19teens and songs written for/with her by Forman Brown for shows at the Turnabout Theatre in California, subsequently recorded and released as Songs for a Shuttered Parlour and Songs for a Smoky Room. They're suggestive, rather than bawdy and they're great fun. It's a shame the spoken introductions by Charles Laughton have been cut - they help explain her forte as a di-seuse. Each song tells a story and makes a different character come alive. If sometimes the character doesn't sing very sweetly or totally on-key it just makes the character funnier, the story more real. It's great to hear them all again."
2,This book needs an outboard motor!,"This book starts at the basics - I mean the VERY basics and moves slowly - very slowly (hence my jibe that it needed an outboard!).Also, this was shot like back in the seventies. The quality isn't as good as a DVD and back then they weren't quite as fussy with audio as they would be today.Perhaps the very latest parts of this video might actually get into real sailing know-how, but my popcorn and attention span ran out long before that time."
5,A must have,A must have for anyone using Illustrator 8. A wonderful tutorial to help you get started. Learning to design is made simple. Very helpful book.
1,Not a pleaser,"The other reviews here make this movie seem to be in a similar vein with ""Dr. Strangelove"". I cannot agree. I found ""Military Intelligenceand You!"" to be totally unamusing; it bored me to death. The military provides a never-ending supply of sardonic material to poke fun at.I just didn't see any in this film."
2,Started out great but went flat,"This movie began as a spoof of a WWII training film and it was doing well at first but as it got longer and longer it moved away from the ""format"" of such a film and felt more like a badly done Saturday Night Live skit. What laughs there are come at the beginning. The writers are far too heavy-handed in making fun of the Global War in Terror to be truly witty. It's not a total loss... the vintage informational film about the 1st Motion Picture Unit almost makes the DVD worth the price."
1,What a trippy joke,"My fiancee and I got this video hoping to learn swing for our wedding. I have to say though that this video was totally off-putting right from the beginning. rather than starting with the six or eight count steps of other videos or lessons (double-step, double-step, rock-step or triple-step, triple-step, rock step) Diamond has come up with a 'new method' that has you making drum sounds to cue your steps.I had taken a 30 minute lesson with my sister and even though she isn't a dance teacher I got more out of that than from this whole video. By the end of the video my fiancee and I were too busy shaking our heads and laughing at the hippie love-in that was being sold as an instructional dance video.Save your money."
3,Not what I expected,I bought this album after hearing an instrumental cut. Beautiful music. Turns out it's the only one on the album. The rest of the cuts are vocal and I'm not a fan of Veirs' vocals. In my opinion she should stick to instrumentals.
5,A Great Read...,"I bought this book and book II at my local library book sale. It was in the religion section, and I thought the book cover was interesting, especially after I saw it was written by an African-American writer. I didn't realize at the time that the book was directed towards teen girls, but I enjoyed the book tremendiously. Not only teen females have spiritual blocks...Anyway, I loved both books and even got my mother to read, she enjoyed them as well. I will be reading more books from this author and you should as well!"
2,Forced,"I bought this entire series for my female junior high school age students so that they could have books that they could relate to and get much needed life lessons from them. After starting this first book I couldn't bring myself to present the books to them. The book sounds like it's written by somebody's mother trying to teach them write from wrong. The author keeps throwing in spiritual lessons every two lines, rather then letting the story speak for itself. The language was unconvincing and unnatural. Are there really kids out there that talk like that? Reading it was kind of torturous. But I did finish the book so I could see how all the drama was resolved. Will I finish reading the series? Not sure if I can bring myself to do it."
5,VERY ENCOURAGING & relatable !!,I am a teen myself and this book has not only encouraged me to put God in the center of relationships but also other life lessons such as forgiveness and seeking God's help. It's a MUST read!! GOD bless the author.
3,I must be getting old,"My assumption is that this book was written for high school aged teenagers. I think the writing style would be better suited for middle school children. I should note that I don't have children, but I don't remember being that vapid and materialistic in general. Perhaps I am reviewing this book as if I were a high schooler. By the age of 17, I was reading books that were far more complex than this book. I couldn't relate to the book. At any rate, I mentor a group of high school aged girls, and we are using this book as a basis of discussion for purity and morality. I hope that they get something out of this book, because 33 year old me is...meh."
4,Great to carry with you,"This book would make a great gift for anyone you know who is expecting. The book itself is small and fits in my purse easily. This book covers quite a few helpful topics for during pregnancy and child care after the delivery. I liked the section for the partners, which explains why aromatherapy is beneficial and encourages them to massage you (which is always a plus). The layout of the book was confusing, because it jumped right into pregnancy care without much discussion of the essential oils to use first. It may be better to buy this book if you already know a bit about aromatherapy. I really like the chart at the end of the book telling you the oils to use in each trimester. It makes looking up a particular oil very easy. This book is a good thing to have on hand while you are pregnant. It tells just enough to give you all the information you need to safely use aromatherapy in pregnancy without repeating itself. I think I'll take it to the hospital!"
2,Rather disappointed...,"I was hoping for a second Essential Oil/Aromatherapy book that would tell me how to use oils during pregnancy then labor and finally for a newborn.Not so much with this one.Unless I read wrong it seems she is only recommending a few oils during labor - You mean I can't sniff my peppermint or ginger when that wave of nausea sweeps over me?? You're crazy!This felt more like a home remedy book *without* the use of EOs. Warm compress, massage techniques, etc. Def not what I was expecting... I would like to know which oils to use for nausea, swelling, headaches and such.Not a good book for picking out your EOs while pregnant.Find Essential Oils for pregnancy, birth & babies by Stephanie Fritz for a list of oils to use."
2,Is this really a book for adults?,"I didn't get more than halfway through this book because I was appalled by the writing, which is at a fifth-grade level. It's insulting to present this to a literate adult. The dialogue is hamfisted and trite, as are the characters.I don't expect much out of a courtroom thriller, but I do expect something more challenging than an elementary school reader. This is just sad."
3,Not quite good,"The subject matter was interesting, the characters marginally so, but the writing style seemed a bit amateurish. Sort of like a smart tenth-grader wrote it. I have to give it a C-."
2,Postcards only,I was hoping it would have more ideas. It pretty much is just a collection of tear-out postcards grandparents can mail to the grandkids.
1,Shoddy craftsmanship,I've owned this sofa for less than a year and it completely fell apart. The seat of the sofa is supported by a wooden frame with a nylon webbing stretched taught and stapled over it. We had 4 people of reasonable weight on the sofa (something we've done numerous times before) and it collapsed out from underneath us. The four parts of the seat frame are held in with small little dowels that rest on a less than one inch lip around the outside of the couch frame.The sofa is designed to look nice but does not hold up well to average use. For $400 a sofa should last at least a year of moderate use of people only sitting on it!!! You're better off going to IKEA or some other retailer that spends as much time in the basic structural design as they do in the appearance of the couch.
3,so near and yet sofa...,"PROS:very nice looking sofa, colors are great,design is very interesting (narrow in the back and widens in the front), the fabric is nice to touch, assembly was fairly easy.<br /><br />CONS: rather slim depth on the sofa (front to back depth could be increased), cushions are a bit stiff (perhaps they will soften up as time goes by),color of cushions is more gray than pictures on website.<br /><br />VERDICT: a nice comfortable little sofa, a step up from my old cheap futon, but a step below a good quality sofa from a furniture store. I like it."
4,My second piece of Milano,"I liked the loveseat so much that I bought the couch. It's comfy, supportive, and not too difficult to put together from the pictures. The frame is sturdy, but I suggest adding some glue to the 2 pieces screwed onto the back (which support the seat) just for added strength."
1,It just sucks!,"I bought this sofa about 6 months ago. Already, I can feel all the springs in the sofa. The springs croak loudly everytime someone sits on the sofa or gets up from it. I have contacted Target 3 times. They do not have any information on the manufacturer, and warranty on this product. So, if you buy this product, you are on your own. It is better to stay away from this product at all costs."
1,Not worthy $399,Not worthy. It stands on five legs. Fifth leg is in the middle to support the week frames. Structurally poor design thin wooden frames. You can feel springs in the cushion after 4 weeks. Makes noise when people (160lb weight) sit on it.If amazon allows me I would rate it zero stars.
3,Not The Same Quality as Target,"We bought this couch because it was cheaper than what was advertised in the Target magezine. As is the case most times, you get what you pay for. Not the greatest quality"
1,Tastes very bad,I've been using protein drinks since couple years now. I just tried this product: it is the worst tasting thing I've ever had in my life.
1,Made me throw up.,"I wanted to like these. I bought a case of 24 thinking, these are going to be great.They weren't. The taste is like sour chocolate milk. I actually rechecked the best by date because I thought that they had gone bad.I forced a few down, (not at once, ha), just to drink them so my hubby wouldn't be all ""I told you so"". But, then I drank one, went to the grocery and threw it up in the aisle. So gross and embarrassing.I haven't been able to drink them again.Maybe the formula just didn't agree with me, but even the taste didn't.I'm giving the rest of mine away, and am never ever getting them again.(And yes, I got to hear the I told you so.)"
1,20 hours MTBF,"Nice cast body - the only part that didn't break within the first 20 hours of use. First the nozzles don't keep their setting - pipe clamps fixed that. Then the wheels broke when it tried to pull 100' of hose (claims up to 200). Dremel tool, washers and cotter pins to put it back into service. Finally, the spinner fell out when the plastic retainer broke. Not sure how to fix this one. If I had paid $10 I would have paid too much."
1,"Buy a REAL RainTrain, don't waste your money on John Deere","We purchased one of these John Deere Sprinkers and two weeks before that, a LR Nelson RAINTRAIN. After two days of use, the John Deere's gears shelled out; the RAINTRAIN is going strong after two weeks of traveling over our 2 acre lot. We had a RAINTRAIN 20 years ago and it did fine for a long, long time.So, I'm off to buy another RAINTRAIN. We considered returning the poorly made Deere, but it's too much trouble.For the record, my farmer hubby owns several BIG John Deere farm tractors and they are very reliable. Obviously the sprinkler isn't of the same quality at all."
1,"20 LBS Connected by 1/16"" Plastic","I couldnt hate this purchase worse, it arrived with the wheels disingaged required 1 hr repair, the spinning wands are so full of friction yu get 1/2 coverage, and the hose ultimately connects to 1/16 plastic , do the math. oh yea an the shut off valve on the undercarrige constantly shuts itself off, i had a melnor for 10 years was wonderful.,this one lasted 1 month and True value packed it like garbage"
1,Poor investment!,"This cute sprinkler was donated for a garage sale, looked like it had barely been opened. I tried it out to see about buying it and it was already broken! Its the piece that connects the gear to the rotating sprinkler and it appears to have snapped the cheap plastic. I have been unable to find a replacement part online so this is a poor investment, even at garage sale prices. Buyer beware!"
1,Broke after one use,"This sprinkler broke after the first time we used it. The part that fell off can't be repaired and we are unable to return it for a refund. If you are looking to buy one of these, DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!!!!"
1,Review for John Deere sprinkler,We have only used it a couple of times and love it. In order tohave it move rapidly the hose shouldn't be too heavy.
1,watch out for shipping charges,I bought this item through amazon because of ease of ordering. builders depot enced up being the vendor. on the amazon website link there shipping is stated as $5. builders depot charges me $26 in shipping. i have contacted them about it and they are not budging. i guess they don't want my business.
3,Prefer Orbit,We had a John Deer traveling sprinkler and it stripped the gears in 3 months. It did try to turn a corner. Not sure what the warranty is. Orbit sends you a new tractor no questions asked and is sturdier.
1,John Deere Traveling Sprinkler,We currently own a John Deere Traveling Sprinkler and feel it does an excellent job of watering our large lawn. We ordered the same model for our son but it arrived broken. The water sprayed through the sprinkler arms but the wheels wouldn't move. I've contacted the company directly to replace it and they are totally out of stock. I will send the tractor back and wait up to 12 weeks for a refund. Based on our past experience I would order this product again if it were available.
2,"Worked first couple of times, then bombed!","I should have checked amazon before I purchased this sprinkler from Lowes. It is exactly as everyone has reviewed on here. I loved the look, but once it was put in use, it quit moving. I think it is way too heavy to move around the yard on it's own, and I will not get to use it because I don't have time to go move it myself. I have to agree that $10 is probably more than adequate for this piece of junk."
2,cheep plastic gears,"Product is a very poor purchase. The gears stripped inside of a month's use and no replacement kits are available. The cost to ship and repair the product by the company is close to the cost of replacement.Unless you want to purchase an expensive lawn ornament, try another product."
4,Traveling Sprinkler,I found this exact model in red from a local store. Paid a lot less for it. Ive used it a dozen or so times this season and it works as advertised.I guess if I were to complain about something it is dang heavy to drag around the yard.
2,Poor construction,"The internal gears of this device are made of plastic. They wear down quickly and within just a few uses, your tractor will cease to move. The gears get stripped. It's a shame. What a waste of money."
1,John Deere Tractor Lawn Sprinkler breaks down,"This lasted exactly three weeks before the gears started slipping. My husband has tried to fix it and he said there are a bunch of nylon gears in it. We loved it while it was working, but now it's just trash. Don't waste your money."
1,Take it back,I am on my 3rd unit this summer and need to take it back again to Lowes. Gears are very weak. If you have a little yard and little hose (small diameter and short it might work for you. Be sure to watch water you yard and never take your eyes off of it! The front wheel can turn 90 degrees and the gears will strip. They need to restrict the turning radius of the front wheel to no more than 45 degrees or have stronger gears. The latest problem (this unit)is the shut-off button (shuts the unit off if it touches anything). The yellow sprinkles from Walmart is a MUCH better unit (other than the problem with the spray arm being too low and hitting the front of the unit. This makes noise but it does not seem to hurt anything other than your nerves.
1,Beware of the 4010J John Deere Traveling Sprinkler,"I have had and returned 3 of these because they fail after a short...the gear drive is very weak..made of plastic and will strip after several uses...I have talked to the product mamanger at the Gilmour Group about the problem and they plain to make no changes to tractor...therefore, I can not recommed this pricy sprinkler.."
5,Nostalgic efficiency!,"Not only is this John Deere Tractor one of the coolest things in my neighborhood, it works for what i need better than anything except maybe an inground system. I love the nostalgia behing this little guy and it works VERY well. I have folks that walk up to the house when it's on just to watch it go!!! Love it............"
5,"Durable, works as advertised","I read many reviews on this traveling sprinkler before buying, comparing it to several other versions. I have used it now for a month to water my front lawn that is an 18 ft wide strip in two 50 ft. sections with a corner. It has worked great. One day I found my 2 year old sitting on it in the back yard, so you may want to keep it away from children, however, it still works. And I dropped it on my concrete front porch and broke off the smoke stack, so you may want to keep it away from clumsy adults, however, it still works. I have had a hard time keeping that strip of front yard watered (having to move my old sprinkler 10 times a day) so it is patchy in several places, I do have to be careful where I put the stopper because it will do a ""burn out"" and dig in the rear wheals in the soft dirt at the ramp. Other than that it has not been a let down for the hefty price tag."
2,works for a while,Bought my John Deere early in thr season and it worked great for a few weeks. The plastic gears are stripped out and now is useless you want to go move it around every 20 minutes or so and its to dang heavy for that. Not worth the price. Would not recommend.John Deere 4010J Traveling Sprinkler Green
1,"Junk, junk, junk",Gears stripped out after 2 hours use on a small flat lawn. This is just plain junk. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it but I was just at Lowe's and picked it up. DO NOT BUY THIS. Even though it says do not return to store I am going to demand my money back from Lowe's.
2,JOHN DEERE TRVELING SPRINKLER,"This product worked for a short time before the sprinkler section broke off. I was sent a new one, but the same thing happened again. The plastic piece where the sprinkler is connected to would just crack and break off."
1,bad internal parts,I used this product almost 2 years now and every six months cheap internal plastic parts brakes down or it starts leaking from buttom and causes not enough pressure to turn the sprinklers. if you dont mind sending it back and forth to warranty than go a head and buy it. It is very disapointing to see john deere name is on this product. Did they start building all their products with same quality?
3,Tractor looking,"Lots of water but moves too slow even in high. Not bad, but not as good as a real DEERE."
3,Cool....Bizarre but Cool,"Whoa, there's some pretty diverse stuff here. Some is 3 finger style, some is clawhammer, a little melodic style, and some...well, honestly, I don't know what the heck some of the stuff is. There's one track which makes your speakers sound like they're trashed.....what's up with that?....and what makes this CD ""Southern""? Oh well, whatever. If you love banjo and want to broaden your horizons, this one is worth listening to."
5,Excellent Manual!,"Imagine how difficult it must be to navigate daily life when everyone around you is speaking a foreign language! That's the difficulty for many Hispanic-speaking families in the United States today. Our community college offers Survival English classes free of charge to Hispanic adults. We use ""Survival English: English Through Conversations"" as one of our primary texts. The phrases are helpful and consistent with language needed for daily activity. The book is well thought-out and well organized. We also appreciate the low cost! All in all, a good choice for school or personal use."
3,Nice companion book,"This book is ok because it has nice pictures and stories. I do like it because it has a ""when to plant"" reference as well as sun exposure, bloom time and color and other useful information. I'm a Northern California gardner and found this book to be somewhat specific to Southern California in plant selection, although they do show, for each plant, a map of Caifornia where each plant would grow. I found Northern California Gardening: A Month-By-Month Guide by Katherine Grace Endicott a great book and of course Sunset's Western Garden book."
3,Tries to cover too much ground,"The chapter on Perennials includes 15 plants. That's all, just 15. The chapter on Roses discusses 5 plants, one of each variety. I think there are a few more roses that do well in California. ;-)Just when you want to read more it stops and moves on to the next chapter. I like Asakawa's writing style but we need more material!So why did I even buy this book? It's well written with nice photographs and mainly because it focuses on California...how well these plants perform in California is what concerns me, I don't care how well they grow in the mid-west or north-east. It's that perspective that makes this book interesting. This book is good for a newbie California gardener."
3,"Not the best reference, but good suggestions","If you want something that lists a great deal of plants, look to the mainstays like ""Sunset's Western Garden Book"" or ""American Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Plants"". What I like about this book is the full color illustrations, interesting lore about each plant, and the information about planting and problems with each type of plant.I see it more like a look into the authors' favorite plants, maybe a palette for landscaping, not a all encompasing guide in either taxinomy or technique.It would fail in that regard."
4,"Overall, not bad","It's great having this show on disc, but don't expect any extras. I can't complain much because I've wanted this on DVD for ages, so overall, I'm pretty happy."
5,What I watched on Telvison,I watched on Tv Tales on the Darkside when it first air and it was ok stories !
2,This is not considered horror,"This is not what I expected. I thought this would be a little scary but it really wasn't. I might get the second season but it doesn't compare to Tales from the Crypt which is way better than this crap! The movie,""Tales from the Darkside"" had more suspense than the series.If you do get this,remember don't anticipate to be scared or if you do,just save your money and don't purchase it cuz it will be a waste of your time AND MONEY!!"
1,Do not support this,"What everyone else already said is completely true. All of the episodes have been stripped of their music and the picture quality is mediocre. Hopefully the company who made this DVD will take notice and release a REAL unaltered Tales From the Darkside. The saddest part of this is that many, if not most of the original episodes with original music were uploaded on Youtube but Paramount just recently had them all taken down. It would seem as if they're trying to bury the original show and wipe it from history forever. In place of it we're given this cheap, shoddy, tease of what should have been the DVD set that could immortalize this show."
3,Should I pick this up?,"Since I was alittle kid I have loved TFTD. I have been pretty freaked out by several episodes, but now they don't scare me but are still very fun to watch. I have every episode in order on DVD taken from TV airings. The quality is not very good in some episodes since they were taken like I said off of TV. I have been reading reviews and some like the series on DVD and some don't. As to the music issue I have read about, I like the music but might not have noticed a difference if I did not read this. My concern is, should I spend the money on buying all of the seasons redone on DVD, or should I just keep the box set I have now and watch those instead."
3,not bad,"This was a macabre and somewhat dark and dreary version of the Twilight Zone. Emphasis on DARK. It was eerie, though it did have its comical moments, and I liked the episodes where Stephen King contributed. You can also catch some old '80s sitcom actors in it. I liked most of the episodes, and the eerie opening theme song and narrator's voice sets the tone. You will like this collection, I guarantee."
3,"Shabby, but not too shabby","This anthology aired an awful lot of dreck over its four-season run, but the debut is comparatively respectable. While the misses outnumber the hits about two-to-one, most of the quality episodes I recall from my haphazard acquaintance back in the '80s appear here: the spooky pilot Trick or Treat (so whole-hog in its finale that it doesn't feel like a Darkside episode), Stephen King's The Word Processor of the Gods, the wonderfully acted (and wonderfully gross) A Case of the Stubborns and Levitation (though it lacks the critical final scenes of the original Joseph Payne Brennan short story). The casting and performances are quite good -- at least for the first half of the season. Sadly, it begins to run out of steam on Disc 2 -- with plot twists too easy to read in advance, far too much padding and an ever-increasing flood of D-list actors."
4,Tales From The Darkside: The 1st Season,"I will keep it short and sweet. I have read alot of reviews regarding this set. Many points are valid. I miss the original scores of music and the picture quality could have been better, but, I enjoyed watching this series again. I loved the stories, and all the cheesiness that went with this series. I agree with everyone that they could have put a little more love and care into bringing this to DVD, but can't you/we just enjoy the fact that they DID bring it to DVD. That is all. OH! One other thing. They need to bring the series, MONSTERS to DVD. Anyone else remember that show?"
3,Confused so i'm turning to you,Ok i haven't watched the tales from the darkside season 1 and 2 dvds yet infact they are still in the plastic unopened...but i am a true fan of the classics that aired on tv years back....so my question is....the music taking out is it a real big factor in enjoying these dvds? cause if so i'm returning them and getting my money back...i see that syfy channel are now airing this show i will just record them myself to dvdr...i remember buying the married with children seasons awhile back and i think after season 1 or 2 for some odd retarded reason they changed the theme song...i didn't understand that at cause the theme song is what i remembered most when thinking of that great tv show
5,Another quality read,"This book makes you want to pack up and move to Travers Corners. The small town, closeness with the characters is what makes this book. Like a Norman Rockwell painting this book brings to the reader what most want, a slowed down, easy going pace in a hectic world."
5,Not for the beginner,"Gives step-by-step, easy to follow instructions to use intermediate and advanced techniques to create or modify graphics. This book would be very hard for someone with little or no Fireworks experience to follow, as it assumes one knows where all the menu items and commands are located. But for those who are ready to dig a little deeper into the features and functions of Fireworks, this is a great tool.If you're looking for a beginner's book, try Macromedia Fireworks MX 2004 Training from the Source. It's excellent for those who have little or no knowledge of Fireworks."
3,Not Quite What Was Needed,"The Duro-Med 4 Vinyl Toilet Seat Cushion did work although not quite as needed. Even when we tightened the velcro straps as much as we could, the seat would slip a bit when I sat down. And, being a cushion type seat, it compressed in use. I ended up getting a Commode chair for use instead."
2,Can't close the seat!,"Stupid me...I didn't realize when i was buying it. It's nice and thick ,but you can't put the lid down! I bought it on-line b/c I'm disabled and order everything on-line....Now i have to go out and buy something else. A full toilet-seat set(that's soft) that closes!!!"
2,Fell apart after 2 months,"As a paraplegic without much padding down there (ha!), I have to use a padded cushion like this each day on the toilet and the shower. I've used these cushions before without much problem, but the latest one I bought fell apart after 2 months. The stitching just started coming out. Maybe it's a one-time problem, but I'll be looking for another brand."
1,Not as described,This product has very small interior dimensions . . . not at all suitable for use.The company will not accept it's return if the package has been opened . . . but there is no way to see just how it fits on your toilet seat without opening the package. Buyer beware!
1,Vinyl cushion toilet seat,"If you are expecting to gain height on the toilet seat, this will not help much. Although 4"", when you sit on it, it immediately compacts to 2"" or less. In addition, the vinyl bunches up and can hold waste."
1,Not a useable aid as a riser,"This product is totally useless as an aid for persons needing a raised toilet seat assist. The seat virtually flattens out when used . Seller emphatically refused to take back product and issue refund, even though no claim was made by seller that it was non-refundable item."
3,purchased for my Mom who has ALS,"My mother was uncomfortable on the toilet as her muscles have atrophied and she is skin and bones. I thought this would make her more comfortable which it does but she can't use it as it is too wide all the way around and it is difficult to do the personal hygiene as she can't stand on her own, etc. If it was made as narrow as the seat it would be much better."
4,Seat cushion,"Toilet seat is very comfortable and soft. During use, 4"" seat deflates to about 2"" of elevation . The only negative is that the opening is very small and there is not much room to take care of personal hygiene while still seated."
1,piece of junk!,The seat immediately began to wrinkle after only a few days of use. After 2 weeks it broke away from it's frame and my wife almost fell on the floor while attempting to sit down. Buyer beware!!
2,Poor Quality Product,"I ordered this item because I was recovering from a fractured pelvis and I needed the extra cushion when 'I was utilizing the facilities'. The seat was used in my private bathroom, only by me, so it did not get much use. Withing two weeks, the stitching started falling out of the cushion and it started falling apart. After I sewed it back together, by hand, the velcro strips that hold the seat to the toilet seat, started to rip out of the plastic. I assume this happened because the plastic (as well as the thread) was an inferior quality. I would not recommend this product unless the purchaser plans on using it for a VERY short time (as in 'days' rather than weeks or months).Duro-Med 4"" Vinyl Toilet Seat Cushion"
5,Love to sit down,"Very comfortable. My bottom feels great. Blah, b;ah, blah, blah blah. I can't believe there are more words required. Amen."
3,toilet seat pad,"These thngs just mush down when you sit on them and I really feel they are less comfortable than without using them. You can forget using the hifh/taller one that comes in the set --- there is just too much material in it. Sorry, but I cannot recommend you buy theses things."
3,Artistry of Nelson Eddy,Contemporary music which is sung well but voice not as expected of Nelson Eddy. The true baritone of his voice missing. This may be the recording but CD received in good condition.
1,Way too glittery!,"I know Midnight Cowboy is one of Urban Decay's most popular colors, but I can not figure out why. This shade has way too much glitter in it. It doesn't stay put, even with the primer potion. It gets absolutely everywhere besides your eyelid. It gets on your cheeks, your hands, and even in your eyes. When you look at the eyeshadow, it has a nice champagne color. However, the color doesn't show up on your skin, only the excessive glitter does. I highly suggest using Urban Decay's matte eyeshadows instead. They work much better without the trashy glitter."
1,Bad,It is pigment put not the right color grot green eyes I aay just go with mid night cowboy I think this would be a good color for brown or blue eyes
2,Eyeshadow review,"I felt that although this eyeshadow was a pretty color, it was too glittery for me."
5,Top urban decay favorite,I mix this one with another color for a dramatica look and it looks fabuloso.I love green shadows and this one is one of my favorites
5,Urban Decay FLASH eyeshadow,"Absolutely BEST, most intoxicating eyeshadow COLOR ever created. Just now discovering Urban Decay and their amazing colors , Highly recommend."
3,pretty happy,i was fairly happy with this product - the color is very close to my natural lid color so it doesn't show as much as i had hoped but it still lends a pretty sparkle
5,Great Movie for Kids,"So many movies that are supposed to be for kids contain a lot of adult humor which is a way to capture both audiences and sell more movies. This movie is a true kids movie that gives messages of love, loyalty, honesty and many others. There is no adult humor, which is refreshing. My 2 year old and 4 year old grandchildren love it. I love it."
4,good family movie,I thought it was a good clean entertaining family movie. My son enjoyed it very much. It's hard to find something decent.
5,great movie for baseball fans!,"Our 4 yr. old son is in love with anything ""NY Yankees""! He absolutely loves this movie, as does my husband and several of his friends. My son has learned several important lessons from this movie as well, and often tells people that watch it with him, ""He never gives up, he keeps on trying."" Great movie for all ages."
5,Everyone's Hero,I had never even heard of this movie before so when I was looking for a movie for family movie night I came across this one and purchased it since it was it was such a great price. We have not owned it for a week and my kids have already watched it 10x. They love it. Has a great store line and very entertaining.
5,My 3-yr old LOVED this movie!,Everyone's Hero was a pleasant surprise for us ... my son REALLY loved it! He laughed & laughed - a great story! (We rented it but we plan on picking up the DVD to add to our library)
4,Great movie for all ages,"We found this movie to be surprisingly funny, and entertaining. Younger children will enjoy it. It passed the ""scardey cat"" movie goers (our daughters) for not being too scarey, even though there is a bad guy. The talking bat and ball were very funny. It is hard to find movies that are acceptable for children, and this is one that we found to have a good moral story."
3,"""Everyone's Hero"" - A Review","""Everyone's Hero"" is the story of one boy's plight turned adventure to rescue Babe Ruth's bat, Darlin, in order to save his father's job. Besides the villians being utterly ridiculous and pushing the bill for the need for editing in order to maintain a G rating, the story is compelling, and my young son really likes it. I, however, continuously question the appropriateness of the movie for small children."
5,Everyone's Hero,got this as a gift for my sisters kid she love this movies at watches it all the time. this is now her fav. movie
5,great movie,My 2 1/2 yr. old grandson loves this movie. It's a great story...He watches it over and over again!
3,"My cat loves it, but beware!","This was a great and cheap option for us to get for our cat, and she loves it. However, be aware that it ships from China and it doesn't come with any instructions on how to put it together. It just gives you the screws and parts needed, and you have to figure out where each one goes on your own.To add to the problem, it's top heavy with an empty box on the bottom, which does not work out well aerodynamically -- your cat just may find itself crashing and burning when trying to reach the top, and it WILL fall over. All things considered, we leaned it up against another toy of hers and so it stays put pretty well. I guess I'd say it's worth what we paid for it, which was around $60-70.Great option if you don't have a lot of money to spend and your cat doesn't mind if you mess up during construction."
1,buy this product if you wanna damage your skin,"- smells too flowery- needs a conditioner to compensate for its low effect- intensive acidity will tend to coz the pealing and scaling of your skin- bottle is clunky with the cap that is pure hell to open- leaves a partial residue on the skin if not rinsed away by scrubbing with hardship- lathers enuff and CAN be a good detergent, but not for my hair - maybe clothing- does not manage the hair. insted it makes them stick up with the static electricity after washing- likely a very ""old skool"" shampoo that was created for gaining profits - not for satisfying the consumers"
4,The Title says it all,"The oblique views of the most famous non-musician at work. In which we are introduced to the frog vision concept, Erik Satie's musique d'ameublement, John Cage's sound pictures and of course Eno's own conceptual continuity. Never a dull moment within the realms of minimalism ? Yes, you read right. Clever, smart, and appealing."
2,Yuck!,"I found the monologues to be very immature and boring in this book. I couldn't even finish it, because it was so lame. Fairbanks should stick to acting and not writing."
4,Great book,"I happen to know the author of this book very well, and looked forward to the publication of the book. When I bought my copy from Amazon, I read the book in one sitting, not because I knew the author, but because it was that good. Well written, and keeps you interested from the first to the last page. Good futuristic views into the science and technology of the next century, and ample opportunities to exercise and examine your moral values. A well researched, thoughtful book."
5,A womans pains...,I love the book so much and imagined how a woman go through being pregnant.. the pains and sufferings .. the happiness to want a child.. and the feeling that we cant do anything anymore .. being helpless makimg a wrong decision ... i hope every woman can read this book and enjoy..
1,Do The Math.,"I don't know if CBS / Paramount thinks that most of the public is naive, stupid, or so loaded with money that they wont notice the fact that if you buy these seasons separately, it costs less money. 2 seasons @ $23.99 each.$23.99 x 2 = $47,98. You save around $8 if you order them separately. Whoever though up this marketing ploy is probably an ex-employee of Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac."
5,The Best From Them Thar Hillbillies,"I'd have to say that the black and white episodes of the Beverly Hillbillies are truly special, for one the story lines are fresh and very funny, for two the mansion and the grounds are well featured.Cousin Pearl had bailed out of the series by season 2 and my all time faves from this season are the Lafe Crick episodes (Peter Whitney gives a terrific performance as Crick, the perfect sparring partner to Granny) of which there are four.As for Season three, the hollywood episodes and the episode where Granny sings with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs are highlights.So do yourself the biggest favor and wrap your laughing gear around the first three seasons, you'll be so glad you did."
5,Beverly Hillbillies,How could you not LOVE The Beverly Hillbillies! When I need a laugh I juast pop it in the player!
2,overpriced and very short,"This is a well-written introduction to calculus, and should be understandable to anyone with a firm background in algebra and trigonometry. However, it's extremely short, and the ratio of cost to pages is extremely high. There are online introductions to calculus that are just as good, and free."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,This book was poorly written and barely got into what calculus is about. It was hard to understand and the examples were crappy. I highly recommend using another book if you are trying to learn calculus or are trying to get a refresher.
5,Scottish Piping and Drinking Songs,If you like real folks songs sung by real folks and real music you will love this album. The singers may not have the most beautiful voices but if you close your eyes you can easily imagine yourself in a quaint Scottish pub filled with good drink and great friends! A definite favorite of mine!
4,Index is out of order,"Love this CD, but the index on the back lists the songs out of order. Strangely Amazon lists them in order."
3,forgotten realms: beyond the high road,Great book the first 200 houndred pages but quickly got bogged down and way to predictabe just wish tanalasta character would eighter grow up and stop getting so many other people killed around her or she woould die (horrieable perfered)yea kill her off and her sister and you just might have something here hope to it happen in the nest book
1,Non-existent customer service,"We ordered the 20' inch chrome shelf. My husband went to a tremendous amount of trouble to mount this rack on a tile surface, since the directions were incorrect. In addition, some of the bolts were missing so I contacted :USE (the manufacturer) via email since they don't have a customer service number on their site. I sent two emails requesting the bolts, and they totally ignored me. Learn from my mistake and go to Moen or Kohler, a company that actually has a customer service department, just in case you have any issues with the item. It looks like my husband will have to remove the rack and return it to Amazon and start all over again!"
4,Bad instructions,"This item arrived quickly from amazon. It is nice, but not as sturdy as I would have liked. It is a little rickety. Also, it has been an adventure installing it. I followed the directions on the box and their measurements were wrong. I am still working on it but have run out of drywall screws, so I will need to install it tomorrow."
4,great product,"Great product, shame it does not come with heat proof cloves, but clear and easy instructions. DVD, creams and cloths."
3,Great product!!!,I've been using this kit for almost 20 years and couldn't be happier!! The only reason I order a new one every 4 or 5 years is due to the yellowing on the white parts which gives an old and dirty appearance to the kit.I highly recommend this kit to anyone who wants a mess free waxing!
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"i have been going to the spa for YEARS to have full body waxing. i purchased this to do ""touch ups"" when i am unable to get to the spa. i LOVE it so much that i don't think that i will return to the spa! the heads didn't line up when i first got them, but lined up once heated."
4,cheaper than a salon,I bought this for my daughter. She loves it and uses it all the time. She saves money as she no longer goes to a salon to have her legs waxed but there is a technique to it and one has to get the hang of it.
1,Waxing kit sucks!!,"Okay so I thought I'd save money by buying my own wax and doing it myself. This cant be used on yourself the wax is kinda junky, and after I finished trying to use it my feet were burning (I got a rash) and half the wax didn't want to come off. I tried oil, then showered then baby powder then oil again to get most of it off. Yes maybe I'm not professional but the wax should still be better quality not to mention that the stand kept on nearly falling its not half as sturdy as it looks"
2,Rashes in skin,Wax and the strip is not good quality ...got rashes when used in areas where i had it used in skin
5,Works like it says.,"It is so easy to use. I was very pleased with how fast I was able to get the ""job"" done! Thanks Clean and Easy."
2,Be careful!,"The lady at my spa uses this product, and it does not seem to be as messy as using tongue depressors and melted wax. Nothing drips on the floor or your clothes. But, PLEASE be careful. I don't know if the wax was too hot when she applied it, but I have several burn marks on my face and neck. I used aloe on my burns after I got home from the spa, but the spots still scabbed over. It seems as though the smaller canisters of wax were the ones that were hottest. Maybe it is Physics being applied here...all the canisters heat at the same temperature, but the thinner, shorter ones have less wax and heat up quicker. It works, don't get me wrong. But who wants to walk around with scabs all over their face?"
1,Wax does not hear,I turned on the heater and had the wax in the upright position with the roller already attached during lunch time. I figured i would wax before i slept at night. The heater (first time use) was on for 6 hours and it was not warming at all.Extremely disappointed.
2,Beware of skin issues,"I saw this product being used in my local salon, so I bought it so I could do this at home to save some dough. However when I applied the wax it cooled immediately and dint come off at all. I tried applying baby oil and took shower but in vain. Eventually my skin darkened (like a scar) in those areas. I almost made an appointment with my doctor to get this checked out. After 1 month my skin is getting normal but not entirely there yet. Other than the wax, the system itself is good. I mean the applicator is very convenient to use though the applicator heads dint fit the bottle exactly but that's a non-issue."
4,Great waxing spa unit,"After receiving a training with this machine, I decided to purchase this unit and after using it for the last 3 months I can say:- Easy to use and clean- No messy at all, no dripping wax everywhere- Even wax application- Easy to remove if you know what you are doing- Save you a lot of time during the hair removal process.- It comes with the muslin papers, which I found far better than the muslin fabrics, also less painful during the hair removal process."
3,Just okay,"Removes hair from some places well while removing hair and skin from others ( eyebrows and face).While this system is not as messy as potted wax, it can definitely get a little sticky. The waxing strips are cheap & tend to fall apart during hair removal, & the amount of included antiseptic wipes, lotion & oil should be increased."
2,A Snoozer,"If you think you will enjoy watching a guy fish in a river for an hour, or if you suffer from insomnia and want a movie to help you fall asleep, then River Why is definitely for you. 'nuf said."
2,This River is Going Nowhere,The best thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Oregon. The story is oh so slow and uninspiring. I love to fish but this just did nothing for me.
2,Could have been so much more,"After reading the book, which is incredible, this was a disappointing film. The acting was poor all around and its only saving grace were a few glimpses of some spectacular scenery, and of course Amber Heard. My recommendation would be too reread the book, the film just didnt cut it."
2,Way below the quality of the book,"I read this book when it was published more than 30 years ago and loved it. (I still do.) After many rumors of a movie over the years, I was quite disappointed by the superficiality of the movie script.Almost as bad as ""Fishing with John"" by Edith Iglauer metamorphasized into its own poor movie ""In persuit of the Heart"" or some such name."
2,"Bad acting, bad script","I had high hopes because I liked the book, but boy was this a bust. The acting was lame, the script poor, the whole thing was obvious, and too long. The only good thing was the pretty scenery. They didn't even seem to spring for casting lessons for the leading man. Only when his double is fishing does it seem credible. Skip it!!"
2,Not nearly as good as the book.,"The River Why was a great book that I never imagined would be successfully turned into a movie, and I was right. While visually interesting you would need to have read the book to follow the movie. And if you have read the book you don't need to see the movie."
3,The fishing is the reason WHY,"I rented this movie because I am an avid fly fisherman. It would be a sin for me not to see this movie. Alas, it was not that great of a story line and if it would not be for the fishing aspect of it, I would have quit watching. Rent it if you love to fish, skip it if you are looking for a good movie to spend an evening with."
3,Interesting movie,"This movie really wasn't why I expected, not that I had any real knowledge of the story before watching. It was philosophical coming of age story about a young man finding himself though fishing. While I thought there were nice moments I found that I didn't really connect with the story or the characters. It could be because I have a distant dislike of fishing and the like. I think if I connected a little more with what the story is about I would have probably enjoyed it more. But one part I did really enjoy was how the film was connected to nature. There were some neat shots in and around the river that I thought were nice."
3,Good not great..but enjoyable.,"I have not read the book so I can't compare it with the movie. However, I liked the message and the beautiful scenery and I have recommended it to several of my friends."
4,Good Movie for Lovers of Nature,"This independent film has some of the most beautiful scenes presented in a movie in some time. I love to fish, hike, and be outdoors and this film filled my soul with warmth. If you're expecting a blockbuster this isn't the film for you, and if you're a huge fan of the book this book may be difficult for you as it doesn't (can't) include all the philosophy found in the amazing book. Books and movies are different creatures so don't watch it expecting the same thing, but this film is powerful and can be enjoyed by even the pickiest fly fishing gurus and bookworms.This is a beautiful film that does a wonderful job telling a coming of age story."
2,Be afraid.. be very afraid.,"The product is OK, but Microtek's support options are second to, well, everyone. You can call a toll number, listen to more options than you ever thought possible, and hold for at least twenty minutes, or you can browse their shockingly inadequate website. I'm not sure that it isn't more prudent to go with a different brand that has more comprehensive support options, especially if you are a new or inexperienced user."
4,Careful on the sizing!,"I typically wear a size 10 regular, however these shoes arrived and while the length is perfect, the width is too narrow. I imagine sizing up .5 to 1 size would allow the width to be acceptable, but there is no wide option. For 29.90 I can't really see sending them back, so I will probably just donate them to our local goodwill.As far as the quality, they are great, definitely cannot be beat for the price! just make sure to try them on at a bricks and mortar shop before you order them."
1,shoes gave horrible blisters,"the shoe fit terribly , I wore it once , and got terrible blisters . I still have the pain. I cannot wear these shoes again ,and I wasted over $30.00 .If there is any way to get my money returned , I would greatly appreciate it.Maybe there IS some justice in the world .Frank"
4,Keeps the fish healthy and the water clean,"I am by no means an expert when it comes to having fish. We actually use this Pond Start for our ""fish tank"" that is in a large pot with a filter. We've been using it for the past year and it seems to work well. We add it to the fresh water we add and the fish seem to be happy. The dogs regularly drink from the ""fish tank"", so it's safe for them, too!"
4,"Solid, Thorough, A Little Dry","An intelligent, readable introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls, covering the discovery of the documents, their analysis by teams of experts, their probable origins, and their implications for our understanding of Judaism and Christianity. Dr. Campbell avoids (and debunks) the sensationalist claims of some other writers in this field, while presenting the facts in a sober, no-nonsense tone. My only complaint is that his writing style is dry and somewhat droning. (Example: ""In the following section, the merits of two alternative theories regarding the function of the Qumran will be evaluated. The remainder of the chapter will then proceed to examine ..."") A livelier style would have improved the book; even so, it's a quick, factual, and serious presentation that will interest anyone looking for information on the Qumran Scrolls and the community behind them."
4,Very Informative,"The Dead sea scrolls by Jonathan Campbell is truly very informative, but at the same time as the title says, really misleads the content, cause one would really buy the book under the impression of having more script from the scrolls and more comparison, rather than history lessons (not that it is bad) but we all want to be more enlightened in the true subject at hand."
4,Autopia!,"As a huge Cars, Utopia and Tubes fan, I was hesitant at first but after a loud headphone listen I really don't have a problem w/ what these guys are doing. The sound and performance is excellent, although Greg's mix is a frustratingly low in many places (Let's Go and Shake it Up to name a few). Elliot sounds amazing, P. Prince kicks butt as well..I see this release as basically a Todd R. live covers album. Good for them, all the members have incredible musical legacies....why not do something fun in '06-'07...Good for them...."
5,"Put it in Drive, and Sit Back and Enjoy the Ride!!","This isn't your Dad's old car...this is next years model, fully loaded. Take it for a spin, you won't be disappointed!As fan of the original Cars, and Todd Rundgren I was a bit sceptical about this collaboration. I could not have been more wrong! Not only does Todd fill Ocasek's shoes, but shines doing so. This ain't no cover band! The New Cars is certainly not about Todd Rundgren, the band as a whole work so well together that they have become one well oiled machine. Elliot Easton's guitar playing is superb, Greg Hawkes plays every note on the synth just as you remember it, Kasim Sulton play's the bass and sings with perfection, Prairie Prince plays the skin's like nobody's business, and TR well, this seasoned veteran is not only taking this new gig seriously...but is having a great time doing so (check The New Cars out live and you will see what I mean).Enjoy!"
2,Sorry I'm a purist,I am a huge fan of the CARS from day one. I tried to like this but can't I was ready to hit the concert too. I just can't. (Easton busted his collar bone so tour cancelled)Yeah Easton is an excellent guitar player. Hawkes too great keyboards. But missing the other 3 guys it just isn't the CARS. The vocals no less. They can be a cover band but no more. Ben Orr had a voice that can not be copied. God rest his soul. Ric is an excellent songwriter. The band was formed by Ocasek and ORR. When Ben died it really was the end. The thought that these guys would even try is very sad. It is like seeing the Beach Boys today. They are not what they once were.
1,NEW CARS - OLD SONGS,"It would seem to me that if you were going to resurrect a popular band from the past, you would want to include some newer material to the listener. I already own the greatest hits album, so I was really disappointed to find that the new Cars were only as new as the old material.The new renditiona are just ok. They sound like the old songs but without the life and spark and exhuberance that was there when Ric Okasek delivered the same material.Don't get me wrong...I love the cars and I love Todd Rundgren, but together as the new Cars, it also strikes me as an attempt for some retirement income.INXS has a new singer who, yes, sings the old hits, but they have also introduced a number of new songs. The Stones have replaced personnel a number of times but do not just sing 'Satisfaction'. I feel that if you are going to offer the public something 'new', it should be something new!"
4,On a Fast Track,"In the 15 live tracks and three studio cuts, The New Cars prove that the tank is filled up and ready for a jaunt on a super-speedway.With original band members Elliot Easton (g) and Greg Hawkes (key) keeping true to the classic pop sensibilities, it is left to Todd Rundgren, Kasim Sulton (b) and Prairie Prince (d) to turn what could have been the typical greatest hits - live - tour into something special....mission is accomplished.More than a Rundgren side project, the band has the potential to deliver some solid numbers, as the three studio cuts prove. But if this is the only time The New Cars will be taken out of the garage, it is worthy of taking the checkered flag."
5,Perfect.,Perfect live show. These songs fit Toddy better even than Ric. Bass and drums are absolutely together.
4,Great sounding live disc,"I love Todd Rundgren's music but I was into the Cars first. I grew up on early eighties MTV and I recall buying Heartbeat City on vinyl back in the day. Also, some great rendition of solo TR songs on the disc. TR is, in my opinion, a better vocalist than Ric Ocasek (although the latter was the voice and the face of the Cars) Also, I respect the fact that they changed the name to The New Cars instead of using their old moniker. I respect TR and Elliot Easton for taking a chance and rolling the dice with this project. I hope they tour together again...Would be an awesome live show to catch."
4,Beautiful pictures with clear step by step instructions,"I got this as a Christmas present. I wasn't planning to redecorate my house, but after leafing through this book and watching a few episodes of ""Hometime"" and ""Trading Spaces"", I'm tempted. The pictures in the book are beautiful. The step by step instructions are very clear."
2,not easy to use,I have terrible hands - multiple surgeries - these tweezers wear my hands out -wish they were easier to use
4,Great Brace,"The brace is made out of strong materials and gives a great amount of support. I was worried that it would limit my movement on the basketball court but that ended up not true. I have full mobility on the court and I hardly ever feel it.Pros:- Great support- So far has lasted two basketball seasons- Low profile design, no bulkyCons:- The bottom logo fell off one or two weeks after purchase- Not as tight as when I first bought it, understandable"
2,Barely ample support,"The hinges work great but the elastic and nylon/neoprene material is not thick or long lasting. After 2 weeks usage, I am unable to get a firm hold with the velcro fasteners due to stretching of the material shell. The brace slips down from the intended position and becomes more of a hassle than a support. I am 6'3, 240 lbs. and bought the large size according to the sizing chart. I feel that a small might have been more effective after it stretched so much."
3,Comfortable but not durable,"It's much lighter than the other brace I bought (ShockDoctor) and very comfortable to wear, and easy to put on. But it's not well made; One of the seams is already coming apart and I've worn it fewer than ten times."
2,really not as good as it seems,"The spandex-like lining is really thin and offers no stability support. The only support really comes from the metal brace skeletal structure. McDavid's similar braces provide better support because the support comes from both the metal bracing and the spandex-like material. With this Mueller knee brace, the spandex material does not hold the knee stable enough, it is tight but all it feels like is a tight women's stocking with metal braces...only good if you are looking for minimal support...i wish i stuck with McDavid."
5,Best knee brace so far,"First it fits snug and just right, second this knee brace helped me to keep working, i have a torn meniscus and my knee locked up one day and that's when i saw this online, the reviews don't lie. It is durable, washable, comfortable. Please make sure you pick the correct size. I ordered a medium, i'm a small guy but the knee brace fits just right. I can now work and walk as needed without any problem, i was about to go to my surgeon to see about surgery but now i think i can wait and just live with the slight pain. Hope this helps."
5,Great brace!,I've bought a handful of braces since my knee surgery and I can say this is the best one. It's true-to-size and fits snugly with adjustable side velcro. The best thing is the under-the-knee padded support. It facilitates my walking and eases the pain.
2,not much support,"If you are looking for support for an unstable knee, this one is not for you. No compression to aid stability, just the hinged joint. Might be helpful for some, but it wasn't for me."
4,"Strong Brace, slides a little.","Brace works well. Comfortable enough to wear all day, and doesn't slip wearing it normally for support.I have a bit of an issue with it sliding when I'm running/playing soccer. I think I got the right size in a M, S may have fit better around my thigh&calf;, but would have been too tight in the knee.Overall, I'd recommend it."
2,I'm really starting to wonder if I am a freak,"It didn't fit and wasn't adjustable enough to make it fit. To get one to fit on my thigh it's too loose on the knee and calf, but to fit the knee and calf doesn't fit the thigh. I really can't tell you if it works or not because it doesn't fit me properly. I'm getting a better result with that Tensor tube sock thing."
1,Don't waste your money,"I recently purchased this item and all I can say is don't waste your money. My main issue with this brace is that the metal hinges rub against your calf which causes pain and leaves indentation marks. The brace stays in place but causes to much discomfort. Very poorly designed product. As well, I am stuck with this item because the seller only has a 10 exchange policy."
5,best yet,This is hands down most comfortable brace i have had yet. I had ACL replacement in '97 and have had many braces since then. Not as stable as my custom made brace but it is a thousand times more comfortable. I can wear it all day and have no pinched or chaffing feelings. Easy to clean also. I am going to buy another to keep on hand and so i can rotate clean ones.
3,Nice Brace But Too Small For Me,"The product description says to measure the circumference of your knee. Mine is 19 inches and the product description says a XL fits 18 to 20 inches. Maybe it's because i'm about 100lbs overweight. I'll keep it in case I loose a bunch of weight, but I'm ordering a XXL instead."
2,Slides down,"I can't recommend this product because it doesn't stay in place, slides down out of position. I originally ordered a medium since my knee measurement just barely fell into the medium sizing. I really liked the fabric and comfort, but it wouldn't stay put. Therefore, I ordered the small. Tighter fit but it still slides down somewhat. Too bad. The fabric on this product is much better than neoprene as it's much cooler, breaths, and doesn't bind up in the back of the knee as much."
3,"Works ok, time consuming to put on","This product does a good job of bracing the knee during a workout and staying in place, even while bending and doing thrusts and so forth. It is fairly big, bulky, and hot and takes a lot of time to put on."
5,IT band issues,I bought this as I had knee pain whilst running/playing tennis. Turns out it was an IT band issue. This gives me a bit more confidence on the road/court but will not help with IT band problems. It's very comfortable & easily washed. Great product.
4,very nice,"I bought this brace because due to injury my knee gives out and i have alot of pain and swelling. This brace is very light weight but has given me more support than braces that weigh twice as much. Very comfortable, can wear it all day with no problems. My knee still gives out some but this brace supports it enough that i can catch it. For my injury it has helped alot. I highly suggest it."
4,Mueller Hg80 Hinged Knee Brace,I have an auto immune disease and periodically my knee swells and weakens. This brace is comfortable enough to wear all day and gives me the support I need to stay on my feet without greater risk of injury. I would recommend this brace to anyone who needs periodic support for weakened knees due to injury or illness. Jeff from Connecticut.
1,Don't,"The title and the minimal liner notes suggest that these are going to be recordings of the music that came before dixieland -- New Orleans brass bands and such. That would be pretty interesting. The actual album is an amalgam of miscellaneous dixieland and other stuff -- a song about Louisiana, a song about Burgundy Street, some sort of cajun number. So far as the dixieland goes, it's all available elsewhere. Save your money for something that names the tunes correctly, tells you who's playing, etc."
4,Well worth a look,"This movie was one of the first Hitchcock movies I ever saw, and it made me want to see more. It was the first ""talkie"" filmed in Britain, and the lead actress, Anny Ondra, had to be dubbed due to her thick accent.Ondra stands out to me, she is a delight as the blackmailed young lady. It is a pity that she was not used again by Hitchcock."
2,I like this movie and I don't,"This movie is better than the other versions and even though it is a Hitchcock I still don't like it that much. This was Hitch's first talkie, but not a good start. I don't think it was super but it beats the other two versions by a long shot! Watch it and see what you think!"
3,"We want the silent ""Blackmail""!","As always noted, there are places here where Hitch gets very clever with sound (the famous ""knife"" scene, yadda, yadda), but often it's terribly awkward, the way of many early sound films. ('Course, I have a VHS copy with shameful sound and picture quality that cost me $5.)I saw the rarely-screened alternate silent version last year at a Hitchcock retrospective and it's easily superior (four stars?). My optimistic side thinks that it's only a matter of time before someone releases it, now that we're entering the restoration-happy DVD age. I call for Criterion to put out a disc with both versions and the usual supplemental material. I'd buy it (well, after I buy a DVD player).""Blackmail"" is actually most interesting to see how even this early in his game, Hitch was confidently playing ambiguous games with the audience's sense of morality."
1,bad bad bad,"If you are buying this CD as a historical souveneir, great! Otherwise, don't waste your time. The ""steel drums"" or ""pans"" sound horrible and are very out of tune! Just listening to the clips on Amazon made me cringe! It also sounds like it was made in 1950. Pan has come a VERY VERY long way since then and this cd doesn't even come CLOSE to portraying what pan actually IS. I am dissapointed that this cd is on the tops sellers list because that means so many people are buying that which is a horrible representation of a wonderful (and my favorite) artform! And a few notes to those who don't know a whole lot about pan:1. Pan does not come from Jamaica. The birthplace of the steelpan is Trinidad and Tobago. Period.2. There is more to this instrument than 5 guys wearing hawaiian shirts while playing yellowbird on a cruise ship.3. If you want to hear real pan music go to ecaroh.com Pick something by Exodus, Phase II, All Stars, Desperadoes, etc."
3,Mislabeled,Some of these tracks are mislabeled eg. Amazing Grace and others. This will be input on your MP3 as is stated.
5,Among Grandaddy's Best!,"Although I really hate to have this band go, what a way to bow out. This sixty year old has been blown away by Grandaddy since their beginning. I have seen them twice (a third if you count playing with Giant Sand), and am constantly mesmerized by their unique sound. This album is as good as their earlier efforts and make it even harder to say goodbye. What a great album, I recommend it for everybody. I will really miss them!"
2,I wouldn't pay much money to buy it.,The plot was just too unbelievable for me to take the book very seriously. Not only is one backwoods maniac after her; there is another sub-plot with a guy from Atlanta coming after her. Her little idol kind of bugged me. Some of the characters were jokes and there was simply too much unnecessary violence. I wouldn't buy another book by this author although if someone gave me one I might read it.
1,"Too much violence, not enough substance!","I found this book to be very disappointing and disgusting. Haven't we come farther than this? And a woman wrote it? Aren't we tired of the depiction of violence toward women in all walks of our society? Regardless of the outcome?In other words, I had hoped for more plot and less graphic detail and violence toward women; more depth in the characters (less sterotyping of women). Didn't appreciate the details on the rapes, molesting of children, etc. it wasn't necessary. All in all, a book I won't keep in my home."
1,Stay out of this forest!,"This book was distractingly full of similes, like a high school sophomore's first attempt at a short story. I tried, but I couldn't finish it."
5,SUSPENSE FROM COVER TO COVER!,"Mary Crow carries with her the turbulent memories of her childhood following the brutal rape and murder of her mother. However, Mary's tough spirit lives on and in adult years she becomes an assistant DA. After her sixth conviction, a man who committed rape and murder, Mary and two of her friends set out on a camping trip on Mary's old home turf, only to find they become the predators of two violent men. The story contained among these pages is filled with suspense and keeps the reader riveted to their seat from start to finish. Lock the doors, pull down the shades and turn up the lights; it is the type of book that will keep you reading well into the night."
3,Ok Read,"I read this book because I liked the idea of a wilderness adventure. The writing is not a style that I care for. The excessive use of adverbs and unlikely comparisons made for some awkward descriptions. I would put examples in this review but I'm not sure if I can. This style may be fine for some readers but it distracted me. Fortunately, the middle to end of the book read better. I did not find this book to be overly violent or graphic but I can understand that some might think that it is. Overall, I enjoyed it."
2,Mystery unsolved and too much violence.,"I thought this book would be similar to Sandra Burke's Bones, but was very disappointed. One of the main character's murder remanins unsolved and the violence is gratuitous at best. Definitely not recommended."
1,Lost in the Forest...But Not for Long!,"The opening scene is out of Disney. The following courtroom scene is ""throbbing"" and predictable. Each of the women characters is well dressed, well coiffed, well educated, gainfully employed and carries just enough baggage to suggest depth. Each of the male characters is either very sinister, although good looking, well dressed, well born, well educated (got the picture?) OR very sensitive, good looking, poorly dressed, poorly born but very smart and...did I say sensitive? Then there's one who's right out of Stephen King. If you don't get it by the second chapter, you deserve to waste your time reading the rest of this poorly constructed, one dimensional story board of a novel."
3,Ok,This product was in good condition but was missing some pages. I was a little disappionted that the missing pages wasn't in the description.
2,Unpleasantly surprised,"I can not begin to describe my disappointment in this book. I am a huge Penn State fan because of Joe Paterno and his adherence to goals, discipline and education. I wanted to read about the man, his ideals as a child, as a father, a friend and a brother. What I got was a brother who used his brother's name to complain about his life and the unfortunate treatment he felt he received from his parents. I could care less about George Paterno. In addition, everyone has problems growing up. Most of us get on with life and make our own things happen. I still respect and admire JoePa. I can't wait for him to have a book written by someone who is mentally stable."
1,Worthless Calls,"I bought this CD expecting to use it at my square dance club, but it was worthless. There is no explanation of the calls. I asked an experienced caller to listen to it and he could make no sense of it. The first 6 tracks do provide background music if you're satisfied with that, which I am not. I recommend you tell shoppers this CD can't be used for Western Square Dancing."
3,You'll need a book!,"This is a fun CD with calls on about half of the songs, but if you're not familiar with square dancing you'll need to supplement the CD with some kind of instruction book. The calls are more complicated than a novice (like me!) can easily figure out."
3,DISAPPOINTED,THE SELECTIONS FROM 1 - 7 WERE GOOD BUT THERE THE ONES WITHOUT CALLS. THE LAST SELECTIONS HAD CALLS BUT THE MUSIC IS SLOW AND DRAGING. I WISH THERE WERE CALLS ON SELECTIONS 1 - 7.
5,Learning Can Be Fun,"I love receiving great information which is easy to put into practice--just one idea per day. As a mother of a young child, I am always wanting fun ways to help him learn. The ideas can be easily integrated into your every day life. The ideas presented are for small and older children.One idea particularly interesting during this election year is as follows: Follow the election campaign of a state, national or local candidate. Let your child collect the candidate's information, find out his or her opinions on the issues, and clip out newspaper stories about that person. If your child feels the candidate is worthy of support, both of you could offer to volunteer some time to help the campaign."
3,strictly colregs,"This book is strictly what it says it is, a quick reference to the Colregs. Nothing about buoys, channel markings, or charts (except for traffic separation schemes as marked on charts). Handy color tables for required lights on all vessels. Not bad."
3,Good but basic,"It seems like a pretty good book for a casual boater but if your interested in getting a USCG license, the information will be covered in the other (more) complete guides.When I purchased ""Get Your Captains License"" the ""One Minute Guide.."" was paired up with it so I purchased both. Getting the One Minute Guide is worthless if you already have the larger book."
1,No Dice,Same as others....tried it every which way....would not recognize a SATA drive. Tried a 2nd computer....no dice. DEFECTIVE?.....returning and will try something else.
4,Works,I got it to work but I seem to remember that it took a few tries. I don't regularly use it. I just wanted some hardware that could perform this function to assist my with PC repairs and it does do that. File transfers seem to work fine. I have no idea what it would do to audio/video.
2,I received a non-functional unit. I was not able to make it work.,"I ordered this adapter hoping to use an older EIDE Hard Drive inside a new Dell PC. The Dell motherboard only accepts connections for SATA Hard Drives, which is a good thing. I followed all the directions for this adapter device to the best of my ability, and unfortunately I did receive a defective unit. I noticed on my Syba Converter that as soon as I connected the Hard Drive to it the red LED indicator no longer remained on but went dark. This is not supposed to happen, the LED is a function indicator and shows that power is being delivered correctly, the LED is supposed to remain on during normal operation. After 2 hours of attempting to make the unit work, I decided to Return the Syba Converter to Amazon.com for a refund, and instead I purchased a new SATA Hard Drive and will no longer be using the old EIDE Hard Drive."
1,Did not work for me,I tried to use this to hook up my old IDE hard drive to a SATA port in a new PC. I connected everything as directed in the manual and my system would never recognize it. I tried it with the hard drive jumper on every possible setting with the same results. No recognition in CMOS. The red indicator light was on as it should be and I had the adapter switch in the correct position.
1,junk,I tryed to hook up a ide hard drive to a sata mother board. this product doesn't work at all. the power cord that came with it had a wire pop out after the 2nd time i tryed to hook it up and almost shorted out my pc. do not waste your money on this product it is junk that doesn't work.
1,POS DOA,"This POS was DOA. It simply did not work, with all systems tested on not properly recognizing my SATA drive when attached to an EIDE port.Avoid!"
1,piece of crap,"didn't work at all, wasted 3 hrs to make it work. don't even want to go thru the hassle of returning it, have already wasted too much time on this crap, not worth the money and time"
2,I couldn't figure it out,I wasn't able to get it to work with an old IDE disk drive. I did use the sata cable that came with it so it wasn't a complete waste
5,both hunter and hunted,"A really entertaining and absorbing yarn written in the tradition of the time period it references. Particularly interesting considering the author's personal history in the foreign service, one can reasonably assume that a good much of the story is based on actual experiences. It moves fast and the characters are accessible, straightforward and tongue-in-cheek in their rendering. Fun, fast book. Highly recommended!!"
2,Did we all read the same book?,"Having finished this book and looking back at other reviews, I wonder whether the other reviewers were friends of the author.I found it slow-paced, with unlikeable characters, and horribly edited. The first part of one sentence would be joined to the second part of another, and there were numerous punctuation and grammatical errors.The story contained implausible plot points - things that happened completely by chance that would never happen just by chance.I bought this book based on the other reviews, and will not be reading anything else by this author.That having been said, the description of the locales were well done."
5,Looking forward to the movie!,"Both Hunter and Hunted was recommended to me by a friend as a cold war adventure. Forget cold war - to my delight this novel is also a very WARM adventure story filled with romance and travel. I loved the imagery on page one - where the central character (the book is told in the first person) described that he ""poked around in the crumbs of my thoughts for nourishment"". Thank you, Mr. Joyce. I can't wait for the movie - scenes of Istanbul, possibly Anthony Hopkins in the starring role...how can it miss? Five stars!!!"
1,Poor coverage rate,I called manufacture to understand coverage rate. I purchased the amount discussed and was short by 50%. would never buy this again.
3,Too Bulky for Home Use,"I'm sure this book is just fine for use in church, but I bought it for Mass preparation at home. For that purpose, it's much too heavy."
4,"Quite good for the price, but does not stick that well...","I have always wanted a speed bag, despite not knowing anything about boxing. Since I live in apartments and tend to move quite a bit, I did not feel like buying a professional one that required making holes in the wall. When I saw this I bought it right away, as I have a chest-high counter that seemed to be made specifically for this. It seems to work pretty well, but the suction is not very good. Once I managed to smash a dish when the thing simply took off after a punch, but that was a rare event. What happens on a regular basis is that the thing moves while you use it. However, I could have received one with a defective suction cap, so do not be discouraged. If you avoid putting breakable objects on the other side of the speed bag, you should do fine. Even if it takes off, it is not heavy and thus it is unlilkely to do much damage. Would buy it again despite this defect..."
3,Bad Suction,"I purchaced this product when I was looking for a speed bag that would be easy to install without having to put holes in my room. It is very fun and easy to use but the suction cup doesn't want to stay attached. Despite the tackyness of it, I have resorted to duck taping the suction onto the table and have had no problems since. Once again, proof that duck tape should be the #1 sold item on Amazon."
3,A little disappointing...,"Although other people said this in their reviews, I took a chance and experienced the same problem with the suction cup not holding onto the surface it is attached."
4,Angry at work? Try this.,Best $20 I've ever spent. Get's a SLIGHT workout and relives stress and hurts nothing. It's perfect.
2,Everlast punching bag,"It was great at first. It stayed stuck to the desk like it was supposed to. I bought it for a friend who needed a stress relief (it was bought to make her laugh). I aired it up the night before I took it to her, and it was almost all flat by the time I got to work. I gave her the pump and the needle that fills it up broke. Very poor quality. It wouldnt have been a big deal to have to air it up each day, as it was mostly a gag gift, but the needle breaking, is just poor quality altogether. Very disappointing"
1,Broken,"The product did not stick to the table, fell of the edge and broke. I will return the product to get something different."
2,cardboard characters,"I was very disappointed in this story. The characters didn't seem real. Richard was not hero material and I skipped a lot of the story. Ann seemed too grown up at times to be a fourteen year old pregnant or not. I couldn't understand why Richard had a hard time dealing with Ann. The two seemed more like a husband and wife ready for a divorce at times instead of father and daughter. Monica wasn't a very interesting character either. None of the characters were the kind you could get close to and feel as if they were real people. I look for a story that I can step into and forget about the world around me. Sorry, but this just didn't do it for me."
3,"Sensitive handling of a difficult subject, but lukewarm romance","Fourteen year old Ann Small is pregnant and fears her father won't understand. They've grown apart since her mother's death, but now Ann has a Big Sister in wealthy Monica Albright, the proprietor of an antique toy museum in Colorado, who promises to help Ann through this difficult time. However, Monica did not count on falling for Ann's father, Richard. The book is fairly predictable, but the characters are warm and genuinely entertaining. The subject of teen pregnancy and the choices teen mothers face is handled well."
4,Stylish,This is a very attractive tray that hold most of our every day bathroom supplies. I juts wish it had been a bit bigger and taller.
3,A bit tricky to see the 3D properly.,"Not sure why the top and bottom of the saucers don't snap in place, that would've been a nice feature. So you have the top of the saucer, bottom, platform for the saucer, and plastic frog. Any child would lose at least one piece in a week since nothing snaps into place. I tried lots of other cool things to see in 3D, but the inserts need to be pretty much the size and shape of the frog that comes with the unit. Still, when you see that plastic frog in full 3D, it's pretty cool."
3,"Cool, but has it's problems","This Mirascope had a few scratches when i got it and only works with tiny objects the size of a thumb or smaller. I wasn't too thrilled with the packaging. Inside the Mirascope Box, the Mirascope had a frog in a bag and the mirrors loose inside. Fun toy though if you don't mind a few disortions in the hologram because of the scratches. Otherwise, it is a great toy. I was going to rate it a Two, but it's a cool gadget, so I put it on 3 stars instead."
3,Toysmith 3-D Mirascope,"Cheaper version, and you get what you pay for... but it's still an eye-catcher and conversation starter! Better to spend the extra $ and get a good one if you're getting it for show, but works well for us since kids play with it."
4,Fast Shipping,"The item itself seems to be decently made. It novelty of it wears off after a week or two. Its still a fun conversation starter, but one thing I dislike is the angle of view, that you can see the image at. The shipping was fast though."
4,awesome!,"It's fun to find and put different objects into it and see them appear. You can put your fingers right through the projected image. I gave this toy four stars because it's a nice toy, but it's not too long before the wow factor is gone. My son does still get it out every now and then when he finds some object he thinks will be neat to put in it, so it's certainly worth the money."
5,Fantastic Illusion!,"I first saw a Mirascope in Edinburgh, Scotland where they have a large, moving one that shows one of the areas of town. While this one doesn't move of course, it is fantastic for getting kids interested in how it works. Very fun to amaze friends with too. I have a few little figurines I've put in it for a unique way to display them."
4,Fun,"This is a cool thing, and it wows all who see it and futilely try to grab whatever is shown in it. The frog *is* a bit large, and very directional: I found that a dime is perfect, as it's bright and the same from every side, and it appeals to peoples' greedy nature so they try harder to get it. :-) The plastic mirror inside does scratch easily, so be careful what you try in it. But overall a great toy."
4,Pretty Cool Toy,"This toy is small, only about 6"" across, but very cool to see the hologram it produces due to the mirrors inside it. My son is 10 and likes putting small lego men, or other tiny objects in it, it really looks like the item is floating. It looks real enough that everyone tries to touch the object."
3,Seriously They tried to Bribe Me,"Well this product is pretty cool and all but it is much smaller than I anticipated. The sellers of the product should include some dimensions so me can have an idea on the size of it. It is about six inches in diameter and the picture is a bit distorted but you can't tell the diffrenct at first glance. I was dissapointed at the product because it was not that durrible the mirror finish on the dome was like a plastic that scratches verry easily. You also have to be looking at the opening just right so you can see the object in 3-D. The people that sell the product tried to bribe me to delete my opinion by offering another of these disappointing products at no cost to me but it seemed a bit too sketchy an like a scam, I wouldn't recomend that you get this toy. And I am confused on why they would try to bribe me with another of these things. Don't give in to the bribe, better yet do not buy."
3,Reasonable but not as good as expected,"The box shows a finger going through the image but that doesn't actually happen. Since it relies on mirrors, yes it looks fairly real and you can't touch it but your finger will block off the rest of the reflection so doesn't quite work like that. Also the hole is very small so only objects of a specific size/proportion will work. I have tried a few things about the same size but a different shape that had part of it cut off. :/"
3,3-D Mirascope,"Fun, educational toy. One problem is that the frog that comes with the toy is too large. A smaller lady bug purchased separately works much better in creating the desired effect."
5,3-D MIRASCOPE IS FANTASTIC - more than just a toy,"This is like magic for children of all ages. It is delightful to place small objects into the sphere and then have the 3-D image appear above the sphere.Our friends will probably all want one of their own, after they see ours. Also provide a good way to explain optical illusions to children."
1,"Not decals, just cheap stickers...","At first, these stickers seemed great. But thats just what they turned out to be... stickers (NOT DECALS). I applied the stickers to my rear windsheild as directed, but when it came to the last step of peeling the sticky part away from the vinyl decal, it was impossible. We tried everything. We looked online for tips, used a utility knife, and even ruined a couple of stickers trying to peel the sticky cover off of the white vinyl decal part. It will not separate. So right now, there are simply just stickers on my car. I am sure they wont last, with some of the edges peeling up already. I don't know how Amazon gets away with selling these as decals, because the stickers that I received are not decals!"
2,"These are ""Stickers"" NOT ""decals""","I love this design and very happy about so I will give a 5 star for that, yet the quality is not very good that I had to take 2 less stars there. These are not decals that I was thinking of, more like regular stickers. ""Decals"" that I had in my mind was only the designed part (white part) will attach to the car windows not the entire thing like regular stickers. Since these are stickers, a lot of bubbles are caught in between when I applied on my car window. This item should have been called ""stickers"" then it would be much clear for customers. I took one star off for that reason."
5,Family Decals,I purchased these for my daughter. She had looked everywhere for them and was absolutely delighted to get them. Kudos for making me look good.
3,Good product,I'd say the product is a good one. It was easy to install with little or not effort. I'd buy it again
5,What I was looking for,"It arrived on time. It matched all my expectations, is exactly what you see on the picture.is awesome. Exactly what I was looking for.Totally recommend it."
1,Look around first!,"I bought this as a christmas gift and can not comment on the quality, but 2 weeks later I found them in the auto section of walmart for $5.99. I will think twice about trusting Amazon next time I buy something. Fool me once....."
2,Smaller and less helpful than I anticipated,This is a one dollar book at best. Not really as helpful or as well organized as you would think. The same goes for other books like it that I bought. I don't have much else to say as it doesn't deserve much more than a don't buy.
1,Great...if you like sinking! And flushing 25 bucks away!,"I bought one of these on Ebay about a year ago for use in my backyard pool. It maneuvered great on the surface right out of the package, but when I did the first test dive (in about 3 feet of clear freshwater pool water) the blasted thing went straight to the bottom and wouldn't come up. I fished it out with a net only to discover that the motor was totally unresponsive from that point on. All totalled, I'd say it worked about 45-50 seconds. Not much of a lifespan for a 25.00 toy. It was made in China. The Ebay Seller did not accept returns; now I know why. My advice is...just flush your 25.00 bucks down the toilet; it's a very similar experience."
3,"Not horrible, but there are better out there","The first 2/3 of the book deals with decorating elements -- light, color, furniture, and so on. If you are looking primarily for room after room of pictures to inspire you, this is not the one for you. There are only 9 projects in the 156 pages, and very little instruction on how to acheive a look, so if you are looking for a primer on mimicing a picture in the book -- its not for you. And as one reader noted, this manual is heavily girl-room centric. There are only 11 rooms profiled -- 8 of which are for girls only (highly reliant on pinks and purples, lace and sheers). The few ""boy"" rooms are nearer to gender neutral and are underdressed compared to the rest."
2,"Two great guitarists, but disappointing recording","I was expecting this to be a wonderful cd. The pieces themselves are very good, but the sound quality is SO bad it is unlistenable. A very big disappointment. Go to the Segovia collections and the newer Williams recordings for the right stuff."
1,Bad sound quality,"I love to listen to Andres Segovia and John Williams and have listen to many recordings from their catalogue. However, this CD was a real disappointment: soundwise. Especially the last tracks with Andres Segovia. It seems that the mastering engineer has used a bad tape machine where speed is fluctuating up and down. Also, the volume goes up and down on segovia's tracks. When it comes to the first tracks with John Williams there is no ambience at all. It sounds that John Williams is playing in a bed room. I really wonder if John Williamns has approved this CD? This CD is a disappointment for me: soundwise. It doesn't have the standard of a good quality classical production with two of the most well-known classical guitarists of all the time."
4,What I've Been Looking For!,McKenzie's book suggests very powerful ideas to help teachers learn technology. This book is directed towards the administrator who is trying to assist teachers in learning technology. Simply hosting an afterschool workshop is not enough. This book suggests great ideas in which to prepare teachers for educating students in a highly technological society.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this scanner just over a year ago. It is alot slower than the last scanner I had....which lasted quite awhile, and the ScanMaker 4600 is already broke after only 1 1/2 year of use."
5,A gift of Chicago Cutlery,I actually purchased the Chicago Cutlery set for my daughter who had a set of knives (serrated edges) that were never sharp and couldn't easily be sharpened. I was given Chicago Cutlery and the wooden block with sharpener as a gift and have been using them and sharpening them successfully for 18 years. They still look as good as new also.
4,Nice Knives,"This is the first set of knives I've ever bought. To me, well worth the money. Sharp and nice to look at. Do yourself a favor, DO NOT WASH THESE IN THE DISHWASHER. These knives had a nice walnut color to them new, but after being washed in the dishwasher (only once or twice) they turned to a very bland almost white color. I read a review similar to this before and didn't listen, I am now wishing I did."
3,Looks like older Chinese quality,"I suspect the steel quality is good, as Chicago Cutlery was recommended by a butcher I buy from, they use their knives. The block was probably as good as other suppliers. The knives themselves ;however, appear rather unfinished. Wood is raw and rough...since these sets usually sit on the counter...appearance matters too. I am aware that their prices are much less than some other suppliers."
3,Colored dots recieved instead of black dots,"Item photo shows black dots on white dominoes. Item I received had colored dots. If the colored dots are your thing, then these are fine. Mine did not have spinners like another reviewer submitted."
2,not impressed,"the games are fun - but the quality of the ""tiles"" are not good. i wish i bought from a store where i could see what quality of the products."
5,extra large for maximum storage and easily mobile,"we use this tote to carry all of our recording equipment, we do sound for film and it fits everything, and its easy to roll around from location to location, we even take it on the train with us, nice and compact mobile storage, plus it doubles as a workstation, very versatile"
1,Very unhappy,"The description of the item did not define that the tray must be installed for the lid to be attached properly. We were going to remove the tray for added room inside the container. When we removed the tray, the latch on the lid does not lock down the lid. The demensions in the add did not indicate that they are for the outside of the container. We made an assumption that the demensions would meet our needs by removing the tray. We are debating returning the items or using them elsewhere in our organization."
4,Handymans toolbox,My husband loves this toolbox and so do I. I put all the tools that were in my kitchen cupboards in it and wheeled it to the shed. Large enough for his drills and saws etc.
2,Not a good buy for our family,"Unfortunately, I have to disagree with the 5-star ratings this book received previously. My 6-year old son will do anything arts & crafts related, and he showed no interest at all in this book. The only benefit from this book is that it got him thinking about what else he could create using his own imagination and a paper bag. As a side note, 12 of the 21 hats were for girls which left only 9 to choose from for my son."
3,What CAn You Do with a Paper Bag?,"This is a book for very young children. It doesn't work for me, but I can use it as a gift. Young children will love it. The activities in it are much more healthy than electronic games for kids. The price was right also! The book was in good condition and it arrived here in good time. Thanks"
3,Better Than I Thought,"I have hardwood floors and 3 dogs that don't always wait to go out. One of the dogs is fairly big. So, I was worried about 2 things: 1. The pad wouldn't be big enough and (2) the liquid would bleed through to the floor. Well, it is big enough for my 52 pound basset hound to use comfortably. And no liquid has leaked through, despite the thinness of the pad. BUT, the bottom of the pad has absolutely no gripping ability. This may not be a problem on carpet, but it certainly is on hardwood floors. Too bad. Otherwise it would be a very good product."
5,Great product!,This is a great product as I have used them before. I bought two of them almost three years ago and just now needed an upgraded one. My dog loves them and uses them often while I'm at work. Thanks.
2,not as described,"The item was not a pictured.It is similar,but not the same.A completely different matterial than was listed.Will not purchase from them again."
3,"Great idea, could use some kind of edging/border to limit 'runoff'","Have been using these pooch pads for my Frenchie Bernadette for the last three months. We live in a high rise apartment, and with the cold/bad weather setting in, walks outside are not always possible, so the pads are a real plus. I was previously using the disposable sheets, but Bernadette would simply shred them to pieces. She now has no problem using the pads.One recommendation to the pooch pad makers is to add a border/edging to prevent 'runoff' from the pads, as I prefer not to use them with the tray, as that is just one more thing to clean!I also like that the pads are reusable - you can drop the 'doodie' in the toilet, and then wash/rinse easily. I purchase three so I always have one for use while the other is drying.Hope this review is helpful."
4,Good concept,"Good concept (washable, reusable) puppy pads, but when you have a puppy who won't use them, it defeats the purpose."
3,"Decent overview, but lacking developer detail","It covers a wide range of Oracle topics and products. However, it does not get into enough detail about important developer topics, like PL*SQL specifics and SQL syntax, devoting only a chapter or two to each. It could cover more if it did not devote so much room to administrator issues, such as chapters on ""Managing Diskspace"" and ""Performance Tuning and Optimization"". If a developer has to worry about those details, then he/she is wearing too many hats and should probably not be using Oracle to begin with since there are other databases better targeted to smaller shops. Perhaps the publisher should remove ""development"" from the title."
4,"an excellent book, very hard to put down","i am also a person that could be concidered "" obsessed"" with sharks. I am only a 14 year old girl and ever since i was eight or nine i have been highly facinated with sharks. Everyday when i come home from school i study shark. i collect teeth and news paper clippings and i take notes from every book i can find. This book just happens to be one that i couldn't peel my eyes away from. It is a facinating book that is very hard to put down. It kept me interested throughout it and it should be highly recognised."
4,The jaws which held the readers captive.,Although known as the swimming death of the seas Xavier Maniguet ties to explain the truth about sharks. He also tries to close a gap between this perfect fitted animal and its status of a killer-machine. Especially by facing the reader with some horrifying photographs of human shark-attack victims. But the book also shows in a scientific and breathtaking way the other strange side of these misunderstood animals and let sharks not look like a man-eating machine but also as an important member in our ecosystem. For those who are really interested in sharks this paper is a MUST! And for me who faced a real Great White once in South Africa it is even more than that.
3,"Cute Feeder, but too small for me","Nice feeder but very small and made in China. I prefer to purchase Aspects brand ""HummZingers"", as they are high quality and made in the USA. Service was good."
2,Vietnam Hueys,"Having served as a gunner in a Huey, I found this book lacking in accurate details.Quick delivery"
5,"Review by Don Arndt, Author ""See the Dragon""","Highest Traditions by Tony LazzariniI read this book in one sitting because I simply could not put it down until I finished the last page. It was very interesting and easy to read. The short chapters and the non offensive language were great. The author's writing style made me feel that I knew him after only a few pages and his personal feelings after the war nearly mirrored my own.We had completely different jobs. The author served at the same place, in the same Division and during nearly the exact same time period as I, but in reading this memoir I learned so much about the Huey Slick crew's duties, their personal feelings and their total devotion to the job at hand.I loved the book. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get inside of a Door Gunner's head."
3,Great illustrations,This book isn't a favorite of ours--the story isn't very entertainingly written--but the illustrations are great and we enjoy it with our young boys from time to time. It's nice to hear about the history of flight outside of the U.S.
2,too hard to understand,"too hard to understand, but will probably just not return it because it would cost too much to return it"
5,Great Soundtrack to a Great Show,"Sean Callery's score to the TV show ""24"" fits perfectly. Some reviewers have complained of the pieces here that are moody, but I find the CD strikes a nice balance between the intense parts and the moody ones. Another nice touch was to wait until Season Three before releasing this music. There seems to be a rush on most TV soundtracks to get some product out there as soon as possible, and it normally ends up inferior. Great TV show, great soundtrack!"
3,I wish...,"Sean Callery wrote incredibly beautiful pieces of music to underline the Tony/Michelle relationship. These are not on the cd. Although there are wonderful pieces of music(my personal favourite is the truly moving ""The bomb detonates"") I wish it were more complete."
3,Falls Short...,"I bought the CD hoping to listen to the more intense moments from 24. A lot of the CD is the atmospheric music and eerie choir-ish sounds.The main theme is extended so that the best part is at the very end. ""Up and Down Stairs"" is one of the more exciting pieces which is awesome. Other cool ones includeLA at 9:00 A.M.Jack On The MoveJack in the Limo (though a repetitive 2:41 minutes)Copter Chase Over L.A.Alexis (Very sly)and Coliseum FinaleThe rest just sounds too weird for me. I like the intense action music from 24 and this CD does not put all of it in. I remember hearing a part near the end of an episode and I thought ""Wow! That's some exciting music! I can't wait to see if there is a 24 soundtrack!"""
3,A nice overview of very early music,"This was one of the first recordings of early music I ever bought. It's a broad survey of styles and periods, from the 12th to 17th centuries. I've become a more sohisticated listener since then, but I still get this one out fairly regularly. The recording is apparently old and the digital remastering was not done extraordinarily well, but those who are more interested in music than in audio equipment should be able to listen through the occasional (minor) vinyl surface noise. My major complaint (why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4) is the lack of documentation--there is no information about the musicians, and many of the composers are uncredited (some because they actually are anonymous, but sometimes out of apparent laziness). Still, at this price it's a bargain."
5,Don't Be Affraid,This cd is worth picking up. Yes the first couple of tracks have pops and crackles in it. And yes it sounds as if the music was transferred directly from a vinyl source but the performances and selections on this cd are fabulous. And you get use to the flaws in the recordings which I find minor.This cd was actually the first Medieval and Renaissance album I ever bought. I bought it randomly in 1992 to try and introduce myself to these two era's of Classical music. And it was PERFECT. I have been a loyal fan of Medieval & Renaissance music ever since. I currently own 25 to 30 cd's covering these era now and this album is still one of my favorites......
1,Junk,"This CD sounds like it was (legally?) copied from an old vinyl LP -- and from a very bad one. The quality is lousy, with intense crackling. The interpretation is ok., but not outstanding. The name of the musicians is unknown, as this record comes with nearly no written information, not even enough information to identify the individual pieces (many of them are combined into single CD tracks). Given the extremely poor quality and the total lack of information one can only say: This CD is junk. I listened through it once and then threw it away."
1,Not worth the money,"If anyone out there is like me and has some knowledge of card counting and understands the basic concepts of how it works, do not purchase this CD. It explores the surface of counting and not much else, you will definately not learn any new information.If you already own a book on the basics of card counting you will find this purchase very unsatisfying and not worth the cash."
2,A little disappointing.,"Good for beginners or someone that has never played before, but I was looking for something more advanced coming from the MIT team. It doesn't go into any detail of any advanced techniques that I'm sure they used. You would be better off buying a book for a lot less money. I felt I got ripped off."
4,Great action,"Only reason I went 4 stars is because I felt like the video was a little too short. All in all though, a great video. They cover a lot of terrain in it. Lots of big drops in it, but I could have handled more singletrack."
2,"Good information, way too many typos","The title says it all. Having worked diligently through the text and the problems at the end of each section, there is essentially a sign error, factor missing, or random factors of i at just about every step. It seems as though it gets worse and worse as you move towards the later chapters of the book. For anyone looking to work through the problems as practice, prepare yourself for this. You will be on your own and can't really rely on their work. There are also very many approximations and assumptions that are completely glossed over. Typos such as this persist throughout the text but are most prevalent in the problems at the end of each chapter.Overall, this book will prepare you for the field on a conceptual level, but not when it comes time to make a CORRECT calculation."
2,Weak Motor,This item has a motor that bogs down as soon as you press your foot against it. Not very powerful - would not recommend.
5,Just the thing!,"This item was a birthday gift for a friend who is in the ""has everything"" category, so it was great fun to find something he didn't have! He has shared that it works like a charm and he uses it everyday to keep his shoes in tip-top condition!"
1,"""EICHMANN IN MY HANDS"" is the TRUE, PERSONAL ACCOUNT by Peter Malkin.","The claims in this book and by the literary critics above are such complete, watered-down, political CRAP intended to sell another book on the subject. It is all third-hand, and poor at that. Read the TRUE and ACCURATE account by the Israeli Spy, recently declassified WHO ACTUALLY CAUGHT ADOLF EICHMANN. His famous book is called ""EICHMANN IN MY HANDS"". Before this book, he had to write under an alias, Peter Z Mann. His action novels reflect his life and are must-reads: ""ULTIMATUM PU 94"" and ""CARLOS MUST DIE"". (Also recommend the underground book written in 1961 immediately after Eichmann's capture ""THE PLOT TO SAVE EICHMANN""."
5,An Excellent Account,The book is based on a true story. It's like a suspenseful adventure story that you would not want to put down when you start reading it!I have read this book twice and love to see someone will make a movie out of it!
2,Broke the day we gifted it,"Our kids aren't hard on toys (certainly not harder on them than any other kid) - within an hour of opening the box, our 4 year old brought it to us broken (the head disconnected from the body). We had purchased it months beforehand and never got an exchange worked out since we'd had it so long (it was a Christmas gift) -- my husband eventually figured out that he could use a zip tie to replace the zip-tie-ish plastic fastening which had broken. Since then, the doll has held together well and is once again getting lots of love and attention. If the manufacturer has fixed this defect, the doll is wonderful; if they haven't, try our zip-tie suggestion if you purchase and the head comes off."
2,Great toy but lasted 2 days!,"Was so excited to get this toy for my 2 1/2 yr old son who is just crazy about buzz light year! On the first day, he and buzz were inseparable! However, the next day he came crying and brought Buzz to me with his poorly attached/sewn head detached! I had to return Buzz but had to deal with a crying 21/2 yr old and had to explain to him why the head fell off!!! Was not a fun experience! Don't bother to buy it!"
1,"Music is wonderful, the Captain is over zealous","Captain Kangaroo ruins this one... He is over enthusiastic, loud and artificially animated in the narration. The music and story are great. Would love to find another cut with a less obnoxious narrator...."
5,Mosquito Inhibitor refills,"I bought these as replacements for my Mosquito Deleto inhibitor and they are exactly the same product (sold under a different name, but made exactly the same and by the same company). It's a great alternative, since none of other the Mosquito Deleto product refills are sold anymore."
2,Too basic of a read not enough info.,Used this Applied Sociology Course. It supplied REALLY basic concepts but not enough meat in the content to help you understand.
4,very good,"it had some highlights and it took longer than expected to its destination. but over all, it was very good & almost new."
5,classic,"my children grew up with this vinyl record. i am so happy it is available on cd. robust baritone voice, straight forward presentation of classic folk songs. every teacher, every family should own this and listen to it!"
3,Tick The Nacked city,The Tick is about a super hero whos power is invulnerabiliy. Tick meets up witha girl named Oedepis who used to be a ninja. Together they try to destroy th ninja community.Oedepis is running away from a gang of ninjas and she climbs up onto a roof. On the roof she finds Tick. Tick takes down all the ninjas that are following Oedepis.Tick The Nacked City is a good book if you like a little action but you wanna laugh.I thought it was a pretty good comic book but I have read better comics. If you have something sad on your mind this will cheer you up. Tick does stupid but funny things in the comic. This book showed me that not all comic books have to be all action.
5,Exceptional for cutting Plexiglas,"I had used a number of different knives for straight cuts to Plexiglas (1/16 and 1/8 thickness), but the scoring was always difficult. I ordered this from AAA Industrial Supply (quick, excellent service) and it's MAGIC! You cannot find a better knife for cutting acrylic. I cut many sheets over the weekend, all on the same blade, with perfect results every time. I also had ordered a number of other Olfa blades for other projects (from the Olfa store via Amazon - another exceptional company with very quick shipping and attention to my order), and all are perfect. I ordered a circle cutter, which I also used to cut a 6"" hole into 1/16 Plexi - perfect. I highly recommend all Olfa brand products. Note: AAA Industrial Supply sells this knife for much cheaper than the Olfa store."
4,An older book with new ideas,"Yes, this book was published a while back, but it is the only book I've seen that shows how to make a knitted necklace. First, you knit a tube, then you insert beads and put washers on the outside of the tube as spacers. Also unique to this book are quillwork to create filigree-like jewelry and origami projects."
2,No Longer Magical,"The first four seasons of Sabrina the Teenage Witch were delightful. The fifth season not so, finding her in college and surrounded by new and not-so-interesting people. The magic is no longer the focus but dreary college jokes and predictable situations are.Her boyfriend Harvey has disappeared (magic?)and has taken some of the charm with him. Josh, the coffee bean guy, is nowhere near as good-looking or as interesting. Her roommates are one-dimensional stereotypes that are more annoying than anything else. Clarissa... I mean Sabrina... has lost her zip, too. It's a shame. Based on this season, I'm not willing to waste any more money on seasons 6 or 7.In sum, if you need a soporific, buy Season 5 of Sabrina the Teenage Witch."
5,The Timeless TV series,Sabrina the Teenage Witch TV series is as timeless in its comical content and entertainment as any classic movies.
1,Extremely superficial,"Extremely superficial. Nothing anyone mediumly cultivated would not know at a young age. Minimum info on international etiquette. Highly overated, in my opinion."
4,Book is worth reading.,I loved the writing style and information from book. A very enjoyable book to read.
1,If you were born in a cave,"If you were born in a cave, frequently ask people whether it is day or night, eat with your mouth open, and have absolutely no common sense, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!Assumes absolutely NO experience in interpersonal relations.However, those who do have limited experience functioning in human society should seek more advanced texts. Very basic!"
2,Only For Those With Little or No Work Experience,"This book was advertised as though it would be valuable for any professional. This is absolutely not the case. This book covers very, very basic guidelines and does so in an overview type fashion. I would recommend this book for college graduates or those who are employed at entry level jobs and are seeking advancement."
3,A good add on to the shelf,The book has many interesting facts on top of what we already know as someone who has been in the workforce for many years.An interesting read and a good quick reference.
5,This is the first step,"This book is the first step to learn how to heal with colors, either in clothing, decoration of furniture, wall colors, ... Some examples of color therapy go from cheering a blue day, to the increase of the immunological system. This is an excellent book to learn how to help heal yourself with colors."
4,Safety Feature Works,"The safety guard works: if you lift up the knife but when the blade is still in contact with the medium being cut (eg cardboard), the safety guard pops out to block the gap between the handle of of the knife and the medium. Once the blade loses contact with the medium, the blade retracts into the body of the knife in the blink of an eye.I would be hard pressed to see how someone can accidentally cut themselves with this knife (say when opening a cardboard box by cutting towards themselves). But then again, I won't under-estimate human stupidity."
2,The Future Is kNOWing Network Marketing,"This book is divided into four parts. Part one is a sales pitch on why MLM is so great (but I'm already sold on MLM). Part two is about goal setting (nothing new here). Part three is about retailing products (simple stuff my sponsor told me). Part four is about recruiting (somewhat helpful). This book is a bunch of rah-rah hype, with very little substance. I was looking for more ""nuts and bolts"" information, helpful tips on what to do and what not to do, and I found all that and more in Randy Gage's book ""How To Build A Multi-Level Money Machine"". Randy Gage tells it like it really is, without all the hype. Buy that book and you definitely won't need to buy this one!"
3,review,The product was okay a little difficult to install. You had to put your back into to get ot set up. The user I got if for was not comfortable with the handles and removed them which was pretty easy to do.
4,Works great in Alaska!!!,"These work excellent in Alaska, keep the carpet clean and can handle any sort of terrain that is stuck to your feet. They do get somewhat slippery in extreme cold, but still a great product!"
4,at your side,"I love The Corrs...I made my mom like them,they sing very well!They are the Best in the World!"
4,I am painting great eyes...,"Thanks to this book! The physical quality of the book is fairly low for the money (I would call it an oversize phamplet), but the content is great. The instructions are clear and the illustrations are very good. The eyes on my pieces have improved in leaps. I can't wait to get the rest of her books."
5,Tells it like it is!!!,"I have read a number of books regarding this subject, and they usually are a just a rehash of the same old advise. However, this book is different. The author is not afraid to tell you how he overcame his own failures and miscalculations. (How many authors would admit that their wife openly proclaims that she is not attracted to good looking guys?) Aside from adding a little levity to an otherwise catastrophic situation, Landry gives concise advise to someone who wants an insight into the minds of the credit card collectors. Further, he provides hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. His method in Chapter 7 for negotiating a rock bottom settlement with the collectors is worth the price of the book many times over."
2,the re-emergence of the soul,certainly a taste of the bitter sweet past with optimism for the future.
5,motherofsix,"I just got one of these shipped for Christmas 2005 for one of my boys. He is a four year old triplet and another of the triplets is a boy and I am now buying another pair for him. It really is as described. The case is sturdy with rubber around it and is stiff enough so you don't have to keep adjusting to fit your eyes. They are smoothe with no sharp edges and are small but adjust out widely to compensate for adults. A neck strap comes attached that I may cut off after seeing how they play with it to avoid getting clotheslined. The view is very good especially considering they are marketed on TRU for children. I think the focus button will be within easy reach for their little hands. If for some reason they don't use it, it was worth the $11.95 as I'm sure it will be used by others in our house."
2,Lovin Davey 4-Ever,"This biograpy isnt offical, making its facts really wrong at some points, like they messed up clint's name, and they put a picture of bob standing with his birth mother, darlana, on it, saying that it was a ""picture of scott with his mother"" and they said how scott had started off their career by singing ""somewhere out there,"" which is totally wrong because it was dave who sang that song to start off their career! worst off, they had absolutly none of the moffatt's music in it, and the highlight of the entirly boring 30 minutes was the 5 seconds of dave laughing about his new haircut. you'd be much better buying their offical book ""backstage pass,"" it's the same information just it's correct. don't support the makers of this video, you'll find its a total waste."
3,It's ok,"This is not an official biography, and it kinda sucks. I am a true die hard fan, but I really didn't like this video. They had about 10 minutes of good footage, but it's hard to stretch it to 30 minutes. It was put together poorly, and I recommend that you don't bother. It was painful to just watch it through once. The highlight of the entire show was seeing Dave's new haircut... that's sad. It's a waste of time."
1,Sounds like a school video,"I think this video &quot..."" am i aloud to say that? oh well. Because it did. It reminded me of a school video, with all the words poping up telling you what is what. This is the worst video ive ordered yet!!! and it's not worth [the money]!"
2,Misleading Title,"I found this book via a search through Amazon. I was looking for a real in depth history of the legend and character of satan, his origins and developement through history. I feel the title of the book is misleading as for much of the text it concentrates on the developement of the gospels through history and how they interpret the Jesus story differently, and Satan seems to be a very background figure in the whole thing, barely earning a mention. It is much more a religious/ theological book than a study study of the character of satan, which the title seems to indicate. Having said that, it is an interesting book in it's own right, just not what I was looking for or, I feel, what the title indicates."
3,Title Misleads,"As usual Pagels is an excellent historian. She tells her story well, but since the title of the book is the 'origin' of Satan, I expected much more in the way of the beginnings of such thought than I received. The rest of the book seemed to be a good explanation of various appearances of the idea, but again, there is no initial explanation of why Satan showed up in human thought. For instance, what is the probability that the returnees from the Babylonian captivity may have brought a dualistic view of their world after being exposed to Zoroastrian thought?"
3,"Excellent new testament history, wrong title","When I picked this book up I expected to read about the origin of satan throughout the whole of history, but it turned out to be a focus on the new testament ""adversary"" that opposes Jesus and his disciples. I did find the book rather interesting as the author drew corrolations between the gospels and works of gnostic origins. I have not read any of the other books by this author, but it seemed a lot of the motivation behind ""The Origin of Satan"" is based on the lost gnostic texts and the author's knowledge of them. Meaning, it draws more on the concepts of Satan as ""opposition to human endeavors"", as opposed to a being or heavenly/infernal creature.All-in-all it was a relatively quick and easy read for a history book. I do recommend this book, however, realize that the book only really takes you through the new testament versions of Satan."
3,"Started out with an interesting premise, but ended up disappointing","The author talks about how the Jewish people and the early Christians demonized their enemies. It does bring up a lot of information about the society the first few generations of Christians lived in and how that would have affected their beliefs, but I just thought she could have done more with it."
2,Misleading Title,"Really disappointed at this read. When I bought it, thinking that the title would be self explanatory, I got more history on Jesus than the Satan character.I did see where Pagels was headed; more of the name of Satan, which did strike my curiosity. As far as given what the title of her book implies; it doesn't even come close to delivering. I don't really tell people not to read the book, just be aware; if you're looking for the Origin of Satan, it's not here.It's a shame because I was looking forward to hearing some new that I haven't already read or seen on the History Channel."
2,"A Meandering, Gnostic Gospel Apology Redux","Pagels' work demonstrates a clear preference for, or at least an inclination toward, the gnostic gospels over the biblical canon. Her liberal bias permeates every page, from her late dating of the biblical writings (both OT and NT) and her false attribution of the authorship of these same books, to her skewed analysis of the church fathers' motivations for squashing heretical dissent.What makes a work such as Pagels' especially troublesome is that her book is intended for a lay audience who would never guess how much of what she states as fact is hotly disputed by more conservative scholars. These facts are simply assumed and are rarely footnoted, so the inquiring layperson has little recourse to follow up further on the debate, if they even know such a debate exists.Pagels' book isn't necessarily bad; it's just heavily skewed toward a liberal point of view. Conservative readers, caveat emptor."
5,a book about me,"hello. I am satan. or I think I am. there's the possibilty that i'm just horribly, horribly insane. i am very confused. but anyway, this book was amazing. because it was about me. i like books about me. apparently i'm the half crazed delusion of some pope, but I could debate that. i'll debate that soon. if i am really satan of course. maybe i'm jesus."
1,Trendy propaganda,"The common trend now-a-days it to propagate that Jews are against Christianity. Truth be told, the painters in the ancient world showed the exact opposite image, the showed the founders of the churches, the original popes as men with blatantly Jewish features.This book also tries to say that Pagans ""feared people becoming atheists"". What nonsense....The only thing the ancient Pagans didn't want in their land was a Jewish-rooted religion like Christianity forced on their Gentile communities.This book is just working to propagate the trendy lies about Christianity that the media promotes round the clock.""Popular lies have ever been the most potent enemies of personal liberty"" - Ragnar Redbeard, Might is Right"
2,hilarious,"interesting and sometimes clever as it must be to propound such a theory. in brief, ludicrous- short on evidence and long on interpretation. the only somewhat viable point is that people did use satan to further their purposes. however, this in no way detracts from his reality. people today may use hitler to scare their children. nonetheless, he was horribly real, yet unlike hitler satan is still on the prowl. according to usual suspects, the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world that he didn't exist. pagels perpetuates that deception, and those who buy into her ""insight"" invite him into their lives, cloaked in light and individual prowess, concealing darkness, despair, and death."
3,A decent read...,"This book has many interesting aspects about the origin of the Satan (Hebrew for Accuser/Adversary) concept and how many of the characters within society behaved in a more realistic sense than originally portrayed.This book, while bearing some slight flaws in open presentation - also has many grand factual and historical insights that have long been looked over. Such as the violent and iron fisted nature of Pilate, whom is represented as the gentle and fair government offical in the bible.The this book shows not only the history of satan, but it also shows the bible is not the story of Jesus representing the Jewish/Messianic tensions...and how both sides have twisted the story to mark them as the ""Good guys""."
3,Gnosticism,"I liked this book as it was easy to read and informative.I have always wondered why the Marcionite heresy would accept only an edited version of the Gospel of Luke, rejecting the other three Gospels, and after reading Pagels, I now have an idea. I will re-read the Gospels with the prespective of this book.She spends a lot of time on Valentinian Gnosticism in the last part of the book, which acoordingly drags. Valentinus was a heretic and much weirder than the book describes. His Aeon's, Bythos, Sophia, Horus, and, Ildebaoth, can, charitably, be thought of as metaphorical, but they have always reminded me of something from Lovecraft!YOG-SOHOTH! Cthulhu fhtagn!Valentinus was docetic, which is not mentioned, and a dualist who thought matter is intrinsically evil, which is glossed over.Enough. I liked and learned some things from the book so I reccomend it to serious students of early Christian doctrine. Gnosticism was heresy 1800 years ago and it still is today. 3 stars."
5,Lovely,"Wonderful bedside, purse, car, keep close to you book of Catholic Prayers, many of which I had sadly forgotten. Keeps Faith close at hand"
5,Inspiring and SImple,"These little prayers are great to go back and read, and pray, over and over. I keep this book by the bed and each night turn to a prayer that means something to me for the day or for the next day."
4,Great Little Pocket Book,"This is a great little pocket book, reminded me of my days back in Catholic School...it's a wonderful companion to rosary beads."
3,Have prayers will travel,This small book is a collection of various prayers in different categories. It starts with the prayers of the mass; continues with daily prayers; seasonal prayers; prayers for everyday of the week; etc. The nice thing of this book is (besides being small and easy to carry in ones pocket or pocket book) it helps one get started in praying. Often we don't know where to start. We want to pray but can't seem to make the connection. So this book sort of jump starts us. For instance it has prayers for the Christmas season. We can take one of those Christmas prayers and say it very slowly getting us into the Christmas season mood and then go on from there on our own. It is not really intended to just be a collection of prayers to recite but a priming to help us into our own personal prayer. It is 96 pages and packed with a lot of great prayers for different times and moods to help us talk with God.
3,eh,"im not really ""religious"" persay but i was hopping for a few nice prayers i got more of a how things work in a catholic church...at lest it does have some prayers that i can use/like....and it was worth the $4 and some odd cents but it was defo not worth the 1 day shipping charge"
3,Nice little prayer book,"This is a very pretty, little, pocket prayer book. I carry it in my purse and find it a nice reminder to pray when I have extra time during the day. The cover is very sturdy and the pages are heavy - it reminds me a little bit of the prayer book I received when I made my First Holy Communion in the 1960's. The only part I don't care for is the beginning which describes the Mass as a prayer because it just tells about how the Mass is a prayer instead of including the prayers at Mass. Those pages are attractive and the explainations are good, but it is sort of preaching to the choir...I say ""Bring on the prayers!"" There are many prayers missing in my opinion too, but most are included."
2,Wrong,The product I ordered was not what I received. Wilson makes the best products I've ever purchased and being a master heavy truck tech for 25 yrs I've been installing and wiring radios and antennas a long time. I ordered the correct one but did not get it. Now they say just return it for the correct one but I ordered the correct one I have to pay for shipping again. That's not right. Time after time I order something and it's either faulty or wrong not just the antenna and not just Wilson. Products in general. I have to pay for someone elses screw up. Not the first time this has happened.
4,great classic,"with a woman in charge!nice twist to the classic western.... very professionally done, without too much typical Hollywood influence oozing out."
4,psycho sexual rumblings in a b&w cinemascope western=vintageFuller,"This is deffinitely a different Western. The plot is convulted to say the least and the film is wraught with double entendra's and people getting shot at the end of nearly every scene. Not to mention it was an early cinemascope picture, which Fuller makes great use of in his compositions. Fuller was always so underated. If you love classic 50's westerns and you're open minded it's worth your time."
3,Need to review performance practices in early Haydn,"While the project of recodings all the authentic Divertimenti for String Trio by Joseph Haydn is very commendable. The performance by ""Das Wiener Philharmonia Trio"" is marred by their misunderstanding of the variable ""eighth note"" appogiaturas in early Haydn before he came in contact to C.P.E. Bach's treatise on performing on keyboard instruments. Conseguently, particulary in the cadences of the Minuet and ""Tempo di Menuetto"" movements, we are shocked to hear a short appogiatura which should last two-thirds of the main note value. In other words, the ""eighth-note"" appogiatura preceeding a dotted half should be performed as a half note appogiatura, resovling to a quarter note. I tried to readjust my inner ear to the correct projecture, but find it very annoying to constanting hearing the overquick gliding over what should be the expressive appogiatura note, missing the impact of what was intended by Haydn"
2,Lack of common sense,"Every time the heroine did something, alarm bells went off in my head asking ""why on earth would she do that?""Nothing made sense."
5,When She Was Good,"This realistic fiction novel was very intriguing. The main character is a young girl Em who is a good person but is subjected to mental and physical abuse at the hands of her family. Now that her abusive sister is dead and her alcoholic father remarried after her mother's death, Em has the chance to overcome her horrible past. This book portrays the human spirit and how people beat overwhelming obstacles to have happiness."
2,Flashbacks,"When She was Good by Norma Fox Mazer is about an unloved, lonely teenager named Em. Em is an eighteen year old girl who is used to pain and sadness.Her mother and sister die when Em is young and she ran away from her father. When Em was fourteen, she had to work and provide for her abusive sister Pamela. After Pamela die, Em is free to do what she wants but she can't. Pamela haunts her memories, and Em still obeys her every word. This book is composed of mainly flashbacks. It was confusing, and I wouldn't know what she was talking about. She would change subjects and her flashbacks didn't relate to the specific situations. In my opinion, there were too many chapters that were way to short. If you want an easy to read book, this one is definitely not for you.Written By: Caitlin S."
4,deep thinking required,"This book is amazing. You really become the character and I could almost feel every punch of abuse thrown at her. This book just grabs hold of you and doesn't let go till it's all over. The ending isn't the greatest I've read, but life doesn't end (or begin in her case) in such a dramatic way. Norma Mazer brings this story to life. Be careful of water works! They'll come!"
2,Beyond Strange,I had extreme difficuty getting into this book. After the first 50 pages I found it to be confussing and withough purpose. It just was intersting and couldn't keep my attention. I struggled to finish this strange piece of writing.
2,Batteries?,"It's a neat flashlight, except it didn't come with instrictions on how to open it to put the batteries in.I know this sounds stupid, byt the thing keeps twisting in all directions and I still have not figured out how to open it.Any advice?"
2,Political Bias,"When a book discusses multiple subjects, as this one does, it is easy to discern the authors political leanings. The author in this case demonstrates extreme liberal bias which is easily seen by comparing the Clinton and Reagan presidencies. A look at one paragragh in the Reagan chapter begins with ""But his second term was plagued with problems."" As opposed to the chapter on Clinton which never mentions that his presidency was plagued by more scandals than any other president, makes him look like a innocent victim of hateful ""republicans"" and calls his outrights lies ""misleading statements"". If not for this blatant liberal bias, the book has some wonderful historical photos and interesting facts on earlier presidents where bias is not a factor."
3,"Good, but not a Knockout","The Holiday Keepsake Boxed Cards are fine, but I didn't find design or colors as impressive as other Mudlark cards I've bought."
2,Light tenor doodles sea chanteys,"Warning: this is the same album as his reversed-title ""Whaling and Sailing Songs,"" available on Amazon with a different cover.A good set of chanteys, but badly presented; Clayton's got a light, unemphatic tenor, tends to trail off and mumble, and accompanies himself with light modern guitar that doesn't add to the ambiance.However, if you prefer that light style to either (my favorite) a chorus of rough baritones or a smooth British men's choir, then this may be for you.Me, I'm not gonna bother to keep mine."
4,good basic stuff,"a good collection of sea shanty standards, sung the way they should be sung, with an authentic flavor that can't be faked."
4,Double the Chan; Double the Fun!,"Jackie Chan actually does a pretty good job here at playing two distinct characters, and they way they interact with eachother is playful, and fun. The plot is goofy, but let's face it; are we really watching a movie like this for the plot? Also, this is a great place to catch a performance from the ravishing Nina Li Chi-current wife of action superstar Jet Li."
3,mix bag,"a father who was busy enjoying his life food,drink and women were edward vii's passion his childern were last on his list.their mother one of the most beautiful woman in europe was selfish in her own way ,she denand to be number one in her kids lives even when they married.their parents didn't make sure they would get a good education.must of the kids didn't have fullfuling lives."
2,Cheesemaking Made Easy,"I would have liked to have been told that Cheesemaking Made Easy is basically the same book as Home Cheesemaking (by same author), only the latter is new and improved. This is not made clear on the website, and I unfortunately ordered both."
3,"A Good Beginning to a Rewarding Hobby, or a new Career!","This book got me started in cheesemaking. I have tried hard to find more advanced books, but I have a fondness for the one that got me going. It is simple to follow, covers a wide variety of styles, but lacks in that it only covers some of the basics, and actually diverges from some of the classic techniques. A very good start for someone interested in this topic."
4,Fantastic for general pathology !,"This is absolutely a great book. It has a lot of positive aspects: 1. easy to read 2. enough details 3. nice anecdotes which are written in smaller letters 4. easy to find what your looking for by bold, italic and underlined words 5. good table contents 6. good diagrams as well 7. at the end of each chapter a good summeryYou may ask ""If it's so good why 4 stars instead of 5?"". Well, the pictures are in black and white. I like coloured books myself."
5,great text for understanding important pathology for medicine!,"I love this pathology book! While it can't completely replace the dictionary-like Robbins pathology text, this one shows you the big picture with just enough detail to fill in the blanks. The style of writing is very easy to read and there are plenty of fun anecdotes to reinforce the pathology concepts.great book for medical school! use this to understand the pathology and for knowing what's important for step 1 and robbins to fill in the missing mediators and minute details for those that want to know everything. in addition, the way the material is presented, you will remember important details because of the quirky stories and illustrated history of how the researchers made their discoveries and insights."
5,Life changing book,"For Such A Time As This has been tremendous tool God has used to transform my life. If you are wanting change in your life and an intimate relationship with God, this book is for you."
3,it was okay,I love this author but was a bit disappointed in this book. It just didn't speak to me like I thought it would. It didn't seem very revelation-y as reviews said it was. I wouldn't buy this for anyone else.
2,Old dog older tricks.,"Herein lies the problem, when a musician has been imitating his hero for most of his playing career what is his original material going to sound like? Thats right...like his hero which is a shame because Mr. Hansen is quite a competent guitarist but one I feel that will never find his own voice in the scheme of things.To make the situation even more annoying the production on this album is truly dreadful.Enough said."
5,Great for outdoor sports,"This item is great for outdoor sports where you might get wet (such as geocaching). I did have to find a laser printer that I could use to print what I need on to the paper, but other than that there were no problems holding ink. I will have to see how it holds up over time."
3,"Great source, but getting dated","As others have stated here, this book is a great resource for entourage, but most of the imagery is from the 1970s and early 1980s."
3,Desperately in need of an update,"This book is a great reference for tracing people into your design work. The drawn people at common scales can't be beat. But, the images are seriously outdated, and the people were trendy when they were created. This book is in desperate need of an update! Also, some of the photos inside are of really terrible quality. There is little contrast and they're basically useless for tracing. I might suggest tracing people from magazines instead."
2,Badly in need of a major update,"This book has pretty much been the standard in its genre since the 1970s, but that doesn't mean designers want to use people, vehicles, and other objects that still belong in that decade. The vast majority of images in this book are utterly useless because they are so terribly out of date."
3,Not for interior design,"I was expecting to see specific types of furniture in addition to trees, cars, and people. I don't see why there needs to be so many people pages. These are not very useful. As an interior design student, the book is not very useful but ok for architecture students. Also, I don't think the objects are in scale."
2,Ragged edges on photos,The first few cuts on photo paper leave you with sharp edges but as the cutting continues the edges become more and more ragged.The problem is the cutting mat. A groove develops from the cutting wheel and the only solution is to replace the mat and at $15.95 that becomes pretty expensive.
4,"So far, so good","I bought this cutter to compliment an older Fiskars rotary cutter I own. I needed the larger size to trim 13x19"" paper. I am very pleased with the unit so far ... although I rarely use it. Compared to others I shopped for, the price was very reasonable, and the unit does what it's advertised to do. I find I can trim slivers off an edge without a problem ... very accurate."
3,"Good, But Ok",I ordered this cutter for longer paper sizes. It's good for reaching those longer lengths but it tends to curl the paper and leave a bad cut. I do not use it for major projects. But good overall.
5,This is a great trimmer,One of our production department was looking for a heavy duty trimmer that did not lock the paper in place. I found this one for them and they loved it. The price was perfect and we had it in 3 days.
3,jane lends a hand,"I haven't seen this reproduction, but I have a red binded hardcover of this book, copyright 1923. Very good condition. Is anyone looking for an original?"

5,"Psalm 127, Illustrated","Joanna Bluedorn has taken the 127th Psalm and richly illustrated it in the form of a beautiful hardbound volume.Each page, cover included, is beautifully painted exemplifying a powerful testimony of God's heart toward family life.The paintings are full of tenderness, natural beauty and innocence. Each drawing reflects a heart that is genuine and not contrived. I also noted that the artwork does not detract fromthe scripture but rather embraces it and brings it to light.Want to encourage your children to enjoy the scripture, to have it be not just part of their minds but their hearts as well. Let Joanna Bluedorn's book encourage you and provide a tangible example of how it can be done.April is poetry month. Why not use Joanna's book as a springboard for enjoying the ageless words of scripture.Clara M. MirandaHome Educating Mom to 5"
5,This is a classic!,"God's Word is on the pages of this lovely hard cover color book and Johannah's illustrations make it a a blessed keepsake. With a large family that God has blessed us with, this has always been a favorite Psalm for our family. Now to have it in this beautiful book with all the precious illustrations makes it so special. I am awed at the talent that the Lord has given Johannah and her lovely style of painting."
2,Not really DVD quality,"The page of a book is on the screen with words being read, really lousy pictures for viewing, and seemingly not well-related to the text being read. It would be better to listen to as a CD! DO NOT waste your money on this poorly done DVD--pay a little more and get something that your kids can really LEARN from. My mistake to have ignored my instinct to NOT purchase this item--felt it was only fair to warn others of the extremely poor quality of this product."
1,Poor quality,"I was able to cut three holes in a porcelain tile with one of the hole saws before it completely became useless. The shanks are round so they don't hold well in chucks. Even the box is cheap. This is a case of if the price sounds like its too good to be true...., buyer beware. These are knock off's of the worse kind of quality."
3,tile hole saw set,"This set did just fine for the job i needed it for. They should, however, have a hex shank. I couldn't get the keyless chuck on my drill to grip them well."
2,"good start, sloooow finish","Too many characters, make this a slow read. At first, it had some excitement and a good mystery. But you can guess the killer from the first time you meet him. The other characters come and go and it seems like you need a scorecard. Ellie and Joe are likeable, buit boring. And that it what the whole book is by the last 100 pages."
1,Not worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Cheap does not even begin to describe this costume. It does not look anything like the picture. So not worth the money. The molded plastic had holes in it and the entire costume looked like it had been previously used. We will be returning this item. Save yourself the trouble and DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Too Dry,"Good info, but because it was produced by a British company, the presentation to me was too ""dry."" I know it said on the DVD cover that the what ever was pictured had the possibility that it wasn't going to be shown in the DVD! True! I was looking forward to view some modern high-tech light-armor but it wasn't the case. Like I said before, good info,,later."
3,Dated Vocab Overdone,"Researching and utilizing the vocab of a set time can be useful and neccessary, but it can also be overdone to the point of obstructing conceptual understanding; it was overdone. Fun story nonetheless."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"Its summary seemed good and its illustration and cover seemed interesting. Even though the story seems appealing for me it was too cheesy and the plot too simple. I wanted a better plot development and a better character development. This seemed like a Disney fairy-tale but the problem is I, at least, enjoy Disney fairy tales more.Too straightforward and it lacked substance. The typical unwanted girl falls for the surprising savior who isn't sure if he likes the girl or not. He has a fiancee and the fiancee takes up the role of the evil stepmother. I mean come on. This is like a Shakespeare meets Disney Cinderella mash-up gone wrong. I don't recommend it. Unless you enjoy simple straightforward Romeo and Juliet look-a-likes I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Best non-prescription product out there,"I have used many products over the years and even took Lamisil by tablet for 3 months. (including liver function tests)This has been the most useful and affordable product. There are many types of fungus that affect toes and feet and nothingseems to have cured mine. But with continued use, this product has kept my nails clear."
2,stainless steel ice maker,"When I first took it out of the box, I was impressed with the look. When I first used this, the new smell (steel odor) lingered for 2 or more weeks. It made ice pretty quick, and I thought it was so cool. After a month of using, it stopped making ice. It has power, but the fan stopped working so that could be why it stopped making ice. I was hoping this would last at least 6 mos before dying on me. It's such a hassle having to call for service after just a month. I would give it a 4 or more if it didn't died on me."
1,"Looks Nice, But Don't Buy It","I purchased one of these units on November 1, 2011 and the unit was delivered on November 4, 2011. I set the unit up for initial use on November 5, 2011. The unit operated as advertised and made it's first batch of medium sized ice within ten (10) minutes. That's the end of the good news. On Friday evening, November 11, 2011, the unit stopped making ice and hasn't made ice since. It looks nice, but don't waste your time and money."
5,Life Saver Product,My husband and I are renting a condo on the beach and the refrigerator has no ice maker. Enough said about that.We were spending at least $4.00 a day on ice so our friends came to visit and told us about this site. Thank goodness they did. We now have plenty of ice with no problem at all for us and the neighbors if they needed some. The only thing you need to make sure is: You have filtered water to use. We wished we had done this alot sooner as it will pay for it with no future ice purchases.
3,Ice maker,I got this ice maker for my husband. He seems to really like it. It arrived quickly and makes nice ice cubes. The only negative thing about it is that is takes quite a while to make a bag of ice.
5,Excellent dependable icemaker,"We own a small motel and our usual ice maker broke down and was very unreliable. We purchased this machine as a stop-gap measure while our one was being repaired, and we are very very happy with it - it is a whole lot more reliable than our other one. It makes ice every day and we have not had any problems at all. It is a lot quieter than our other one too. I would recommend this ice maker to anyone. Apart from anything else, it looks good too! It would fit well into any kitchen. Thoroughly recommended."
4,Good machine,"Well I never have used or even seen one but my wife just had to have one and this one seems to be a good one it make ice cubes in 3 sizes, it makes them very fast, the wife cleaned it up when it came with mild soapy water rinsed it and than I had read on another review of this product or one like it where they used lemon juice to rinse it with so she cut a lemon in half and rub it all over the open surfaces (inside)rinsed it off and she was making ice in minutes and she says the ice was fine no taste, so if you're looking for an inexpensive icemaker we recommend this one."
3,"Mediocre in effectiveness, short range","I bought this product at Walmart last year for $14.99. It works by using mosquito repellant packs that are mildly heated by the device. Repellant packs each last about 2 weeks and cost about $7.00 for a twin pack.The internal batteries are charged by solar.In researching the product online, descriptions had stated ""effective for 100 feet"", so I'd thought that would cover most of my backyard. Turns out, it covers a 10 x 10 area, so it's more for the size of patio than a whole yard. Even so, it did reduce (but not eliminate) the mosquitos that came around. I doubt that it is more effective than an ordinary citronella candle. Did not have a noticeable odor, and is attractive to sit on the patio or in a nearby flowerbed."
1,A looser,This device is totally ineffective. It's 100 sq ft capacity matched our problem area. The mosquitoes bite you even within a few feet of this joke machine.
2,Great Detail - Poor Writing,"This is obviously well researched and has plenty of detail - too much, in fact. Be prepared to be bombarded with unit numbers right off the bat. Not light reading, this is only for the serious researcher used to taking copious notes while reading..."
3,more unit movements/not much individual situations,Very confusing describing unit dispositions and movements.had to continue to turn back to maps which were not too helpful due to large areas depicted.(Referred to houses etc not on map)I thought that I would read about individual situations of 57mm crews and rifle companies against panzers. Got too much our tanks and TD's.See Citizen Soldier book.more about poor line company GI's.
2,"Worth it, but barely","We purchased this to use as a prop for a science fair demonstration on radar and stealth technology. It will work for that purpose but was a pain to put together, in part due to the directions consisting of lines, letters, numbers, and arrows going everywhere and no explanations to what the various words and symbols mean and in part due to the tiny and fragile pieces. I am a 41yo teacher who has put models together before and while it wasn't difficult from a skill level, it was very frustrating that the pieces broke so easily.The quality seems pretty poor, very light and thin plastic but since we will be using it as a display, it should last for us. ""Tweezers"" should be listed in the necessary tools. All in all, it is not what I hoped for but we will make it work for us."
5,Awesome for waves,"This feels greasy in your hand and when you put it on it seems like it could be greasy, but it dries and really makes your hair nice. I have borderline wavy hair, if I blow dry my hair straightens out, but if I put this in while it is wet and let it air dry, it really makes my hair wavy. Or, if you dry your hair normally and then smooth this through it will create nice waves in your hair. This product is TOTALLY different from any product out there. I have tried everything-Redken, aveda, scrunching sprays, curling creams--nothing works like this. You have to play with it a little to know what works for your hair. Again, it seems like it is greasy but it is NOT when it dries (if it was greasy it wouldn't dry)."
1,What did you do??,I have been using this product for YEARS!!! I have naturally curly hair and this is the only thing that I can use to scrunch and dry with any success. BUT... since October (when I finally started seeing it in the stores again) they serum has a horrible smell to it (like a mens cologne). I cant stand having it in my hair. I also have sensitivity issues to scents and so I can not use this anymore.
5,Love it!,"I have heavy, wavy hair and this product is my lifesaver! It does not add any more weight to my hair, it defines the curls better and it makes the frizz go away! I have been looking for this for a while, and I was so happy when I saw amazon had it! I will keep on buying this product!"
1,Worthless,"This was recommended to me for my thick, curly hair that's prone to frizz. It was a total waste of money. It made my hair greasy and did nothing at all for the frizz or fly aways. Same results with FX Silk Drops."
3,The hold doesn't last,"This product is great because the price, the smell, it defines curls and reduces frizz. The problem is the hold only lasts a few hours and if you try to reapply to dry hair it gets goopy but not hard. I have long ringlet curly hair and I need a product that lasts atleast ten hours."
5,Love this stuff!,I absolutely love Fx Curls up! It is a very good product at a very reasonable price. Other products that I have tried have left my hair either too stiff or oily looking. The Curls up does an excellent job at defrizzing and defining my curls.
3,Good product...but they screwed it up recently,"I have used this product for years and very successfully. I have soft but curly hair and I hate creams/gels that leave it crunchy and ""un-hairlike"". I used the Aveda ""Be Curly"" for a long time but it got expensive as it went through it real quick. Found this in the local pharmacy store and tried it. I was hooked! It controlled my frizz while defining my curls all without making it crunchy. Perfect! Until they changed it recently. It doesn't work the same way anymore. My hair is frizzy even after using it and it doesn't do anything to enhance the curls..Very disappointing. Please bring the old product back! :("
4,So Cute!!,"I thought this was so original. I am a Winnie the pooh fan and I live in Alaska, I received my keys in 4 days and that's good for here!! The keys are true to photo and work well so much so that I went online again and got a few more for other members of my family."
3,Prairie Home Soundtrack,"I was disappointed that the song that was played during the movie credits at the end of the movie was not on this soundtrack, CD or DVD! That was my favorite song. How can I find it?"
5,A Prairie Home Companion CD and DVD,"I absolutely love it, the CD and the DVD. We play it all the time and love looking at the parts from the movie."
4,prairie as home,"If you like the radio program, you will love the film and music -- vintage Keillor & wonderful company... the quintessential performance/celebration, including the existential riff of finitude and endings..."
2,"Buy the CD, skip the DVD","If you love ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" it is fun to watch top stars perform with Garrison, and I admired how subtly he wove Lake Wobegon stories into the dialogue. However, if you expect movies to have plots, this flick isn't for you. No discernable rising action or climax, and the resolution was limp, as if Garrison ran out of ideas to tie up the direction he took the material. I wish GK had instead presented his annual joke show. Don't let the movie fool you if you've never heard ""A Prairie Home Companion."" It is a 100% entertaining radio show. The songs in the movie are well-performed and I was impressed with the peformances. Woody Harrelson, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin can sing!"
4,"Wonderful CD, but can be difficult to import","Following John's advice I tried countless times to get my iMac G5 to read the disk, but no luck. There's more than one way around it, though. I loaded the disk onto my ancient G3 iBook which recognized it immediately. Using a 1GB thumb drive I copied the songs and carried them back to my iMac. Using the iTunes ""add to library"" command (rather than ""import""), I soon had all the songs in iTunes.The disk is great, but this shouldn't be so difficult, hence one star off for the trouble."
1,"If you use Ipods or other MP3 players, don't bother with this one.","New Line Records has once again released a music CD that doesn't follow the CD standard. This CD will not play on your MAC, in order to put into Itunes for your Ipod. Don't waste your time buying it. It's too bad, because I really liked the soundtracks."
1,THE Doctrine of SATAN,"Like all the other deniers of salvation through faith alone, Gaffin(p.13) claims Vos and Ridderbos conclude ""The center of Paul's teaching is not found in the doctrine of justification by faith...."" Every anti-Christ religion teaches works (self)righteouness as does N.T. Wright, Norman Shepherd, Kenny Gentry Jr., Sanders, Dunn, Auburn Avenue theology, Federal Vision, sadly the list goes on."
5,Great,"My mom usually gets her plate hangers from Walmart, but they had run out and she wanted to buy like 20 of them O_O so I ordered them here and it was just what she needed. Sturdy and stretchy, yay."
1,bed side book,Could not stay awake for more than 3 pages.Could not be get into this book maybe I can't see the horror in a ghost story.Lacks suspence very predictable.
1,Not worth it...,"Kojo Laing is my homeboy. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book of his to anyone. It's a confusing tale of humans, animals and plants living together in a futuristic world whilst a series of 'friendly' wars are raging on. If you are taken aback by the cover of the book, you should be because once you start reading you are surely going to get confused.I'm an avid reader of books in the African Writers Series. ""Major Gentl and the Achimota Wars"" does a disservice to the quality of African storytelling as evidenced by the writings of Chinua Achebe, Cyprian Ekwensi, Sembene Ousmane and other accomplished African writers. I simply don't get Laing's poetic style of writing. I cannot find any literary value to this book."
5,A Fantasic Magazine About Scotland!,"My family loves this magazine. If you love Scotland, you will greatly enjoy reading this mag cover to cover! I spend hours reading each episode when they come."
5,Interesting,"This is my favorite Scottish magazine. It has news items and wonderful articles about places to visit, unusual occupations and things to do. One of my favorite articles was about Cawdor Castle. Great place to read about Scotland."
1,Biased...,"While always maintaining a facade of open-mindedness and balance, Shanley nevertheless barrels forward with half-truths and shady logic to further alienate the Muslim world. I have since seen Shanley shilling his book on Christian websites and belittling anyone who challenges his views. Having a balanced reporting of what it is like to be a Muslim and the reasons behind terrorism would be an invaluable book indeed. Unfortunately, this book contains neither. If you are a die-hard anti-Muslim who would like nothing more than to sound smart while you rail against Islam, this book should give you plenty of ammunition."
4,Handy!,"This product is very handy if you have a big diaper bag like I do. Instead of digging around for a pacifier, one is always within reach. For the price, I expected the product to be a bit sturdier. But overall, it does what it's supposed to. Three NUK pacifiers fit inside."
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE PAID,"My 6 year old son spent his own money on this toy (about $20). He played with it for an hour and then asked to return it. He said that it doesn't have 3 toys in one, which one is led to believe from the packaging. It should be labeled 2 in one, which would better reflect the packaging.The wingtips fall off when snapping the motorcycle part into the flight part. It was difficult for my son to put the pieces together.The noises are intermittent. I checked the batteries and it requires 3 of the A76 batteries (also used for hearing aids). These are very expensive.The toy is so specific that one is required to buy the exact Batman to use it.This was a very disappointing purchase. We do not recommend this toy."
3,Great music but what you see isn't what you get,"The first five pieces feature Charlie Christian in jam sessions at Minton's Playhouse. Great primordial bebop played with Monk, Byas, Dizzy and others.The second group are fully developed bebop, played by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Slam Stewart in 1945. Charlie Christian had died some years earlier, as pointed out by another Amazon reviewer. This guitarist is Remo Palmeri.This is the same selection of pieces put out by Laserlight some years ago under Charlie Christian's name, with the same title."
4,Good for photos,"I use this trimmer for cutting 8 1/2 x 11 photo paper down to 8 x 10 and A3 photo paper down to 11 x 14 to fit in standard frames. It does the job and is better than some others I've used, but I've found you still need to ""peel"" the trim from the main page. It does the job so I don't have any complaints about that and I needed this larger size for the larger paper I use, but I have used some trimmers where the trim just falls off once it's cut. Don't expect it to do that and for that reason I can only give this 4 stars."
5,Heavy Duty Rotary Cutter,so far this is an excellent piece for my art workit cuts multiple layers with clean cuts- saving me timerecommend it highly
5,3-M Undercoating,"This undercoat performs well. Applied very uniformly, no spatter. Used half the can one day, used the rest two weeks later with no clogging of nozzle or any other issues. Definitely good stuff."
5,It's 3M...U expect good stuff.,It cost less even with the shipping that the stuff I had bought at NAPA. It went on better(thicker)with more coverage and dried quicker. If you heat the cans up in hot water it works even better. Ill buy it and use it again when I need more undercoating.
4,Pleased with item,"I had never even known about bottle collecting until my new step grandson became fascinated with the process. I ordered blind and the book was on time, in good shape and he was pleased with my attempt to get him something he really wanted!"
2,"All Show, No Go","bought this refer. 4 years ago based on looks, features, price and a good review in Consumer's Report. Last weekend the compressor bit the dust and repairman said it could not be repaired locally (something about a sealed system). Amana had a 5 year warranty on major components at that time so am still waiting on resolution from company. Now they only offer a 1 year warranty which is shameful for a $2000 appliance."
1,Disappointed in this Refrigerator,"We've had this refrigerator (stainless steel model) for just over 1-1/2 years. It has broken down once (right after the warranty expired) - same issue as others had (the fan). Is is noisy. The freezer handle has broken off completely once, and has popped off again since being repaired. The interior drawer cover is worthless. The stainless steel is of poor quality and is easily dented (even dropping an ice cube on the top of the freezer drawer is enough to create a dent. One of the worst appliance decisions I've ever made."
1,"Two years, broke down twice","We purchased this product based on consumer reports, ratings. Loved how roomy it was. Everything was fine till 1 year and 1 month. Stopped working. Amana agreed to fix it although it was outside the one year warranty after some conversation. Some electric part had melted.Now it is broken again after two years. Top shelf is not cold. We are told defrost board needs to be changed.Unfortunately it has not worked for us. On a positive note, it helps you clean out the fridge every year and start fresh :)"
1,Do NOT buy an AMANA,"$2000 refrigerator doesn't even last 4 years, compressor went out. Technician said, ""Yep, see it all the time"". I think Amana and Whirlpool and some others all used the same compressor. Do your homework and save your receipts."
1,Remember when Amana was great? It isn't anymore.,"Remember when the Amana line of appliance was American made, lasted forever, cutting edge, and totally terrific. Those days are OVER. They are so poorly made, they break down all the time, and they are just junk. I am a landlord who bought three of these on sale for some apartments, and they ALL were worthless. I had to buy refrigerators all over again for each apartment within two years. What are the odds of that happening? I got sick of the repair bills. I remember my mom getting the first Radar Range in the neighborhood, and how everybody oo'd and aaah'd at how hi tech we were because we could afford Amana. I think these junky companies buy out the name brand, and run it into the ground. Avoid like the plague!"
1,Yep. A real dog,"Under two years old, repaired at 11 months and gone again. Search the web and there's a plethora of problems with these things."
1,This refrigerator should get negative stars,"Purchased this refrigerator (Amana AFD2535DEW) in November of 2008. Fast forward to today (December 2012) and I am out $200+ to repair a failed defrost circuit board (freezer was frozen over in the rear and the refrigerator would no longer cool because of it). I paid a lot of money for a high end refrigerator rated highly by Consumer Reports and I get something that fails four years later. To add insult to injury, the freezer handle feels like it is ready to fall off (reading online that this is a common problem as well with no known good fix). I will never buy a Maytag/Whirlpool/Amana product again in my life. I am also writing to Consumer Reports in hope that they lower their rating and remove any recommendation of this product."
2,failed after 4 years,"The refrigerator is beautiful. Very convenient. Looks great. BUT after only 4 years, the freezer freezes over, blocking the vents to the refrigerator. Cost of repair is $200+. I have never had an appliance fail so early, but I cant afford to replace it."
1,"Don't buy this one, just keep looking for something else","I have owned the refrig for about 5 years now. Pros: its stainless steel, Cons: The ice maker has died 5 times and been replace 5 times, The freezer has built ice around the fan to the point that cool air to the refrig stops blowing every 4 months since it was new and have to manually defrost it to get working again, repair guys can't figure it out and have stopped trying. The doors are not quite aligned correctly. The only good thing that I can say is if you are handy and like to work on your own appliances then this is the refrig for you, you will have a full time project keeping it going."
1,Frequent FAilure,"My Amana refrigerator is almost 8 years old. It just broke for the second time last week. A new compressor is needed now for around $650. The last break down was much cheaper to fix. However, I've had many refrigerators and I dont recall any of them breaking down. I won't buy Amana again."
4,A surprising book for a wider audience than Mormon Homemakers,"I am a 56 year old male who reads philosophy, theology and science mostly. Somehow I came across Kathryn Kidd's Paradise View series and loved them. She gets in to the mind of Mormons very well and reveals yet respects what she finds. The Aphabet year is a perspective on the value and genius of Mormon stay at home Mom's. Quite entertaining and a big surprise at the end. Kathryn keep writing."
4,Stylish,"I like the lanyard, it holds the iPod Mini even when I yank at it and jump around. Good for Mini owners with Shuffle envy. A lot better to carry around your iPod than the belt clip. I don't want to see it when it gets dirty though, no cleaning instructions included. Overall, I'm satisfied, but it could've been alot cheaper. Remember Apple, he Mini is supposed to be the LOW cost alternative."
5,Goodness.,"This was a fantastic purchase!Totally an original product from 2004!They look great!Thank you!Also, Apple really knows how to package their stuff."
5,Easy to use,"As other people said in their reviews, this can be used as a potato masher too!! It's a perfect size for me and easy to use and clean. And dishwasher safe. Awesome!!"
5,INSPIRATIONAL!,"truely inspirational, haunting,and enchanting. Beautiful gregorian like vocals performed by children. If you like ERA,PILGRIMAGE, OR ADIEMUS you will LOVE THIS! If you like NEW AGE, OR GOTH-LIKE MEDIAEVAL I SUGGEST YOU TRY THIS! IT IS SOME OF THE MOST HEAVENLY MUSIC I HAVE EVER HEARD! LIKE ADIEMUS ,BUT gregorian like instead of African like. Its a lot like ERA , But with children. If you are an ENIGMA FAN AND ENJOY INSPIRATIONAL VOCAL SINGING YOU SHOULD BUY THIS! IT WILL RELAX YOU, INSPIRE YOU, LIFT YOU TO THE SKY!!!!"
5,Stay at home dad,Absolutely loved the book and am recommending it to all my friends. What a wonderful and refreshingly frank approach to caring for a newborn. Don't be turned off by the negative reviews you read here. If they knew so much about how to raise a child why did they need to read a book about it. When Dr. Zukow wrote breast feeding is becoming a cult he must have struck a nerve.
1,No wonder this book is on clearance everywhere,"It's a big bag of garbage!This doctor is the worst kind.....the kind that formulates his own opinions based on nothing and then tries to pass them off as expert advice. He may be a pediatrician, but youd never know it by the advice offered in this book. The book constantly recomends practices that go against everything we currently know to be healthy for a child. What a waste of time this book was."
4,Questions & Answers = Less Co-pays,"Why wasn't this book around when I had my 1st baby? I had hundreds of questions to which my husband thought were crazy, my mom said we didn't worry about that 30 years ago and my doctor was at wits end with my weekly visits for some imagined aliment or another. This book covers 365 common (some not so common) questions for new parents. The questions aren't in any particular order so you must refer to the index for the area you need. The areas included are: getting the baby on schedule; bonding; teething; sibling rivalry; daycare; infections; check-ups; vaccines; introducing solid foods; and how long should one breast feed.The answers are easy to read. The advice and suggestions seem to be general answers that any pediatrician would provide. The format will help any new parent be more relaxed and keep those late night questions answered without waking up everyone.DeltareviewerReviewing for Real Page Turners"
2,Be careful with some of the advice,"Question 209 recommends sticking your finger down the throat of a choking infant. I am not sure where he got that advice, but it is totally against all recommendations by the American Heart Association in Basic Life Support. I also checked with a friend who is an emergency room physician at a children's hospital and he reiterated to never stick you finger down the throat. By doing so, you can make a choking siutation much worse!"
1,can't get it,I have ordered this twice and the vendor told me the order was damaged and they had no more each timeapparently they don't want my business
1,NO CC/subtitles!?,"I am 62 years old, have a hard time hearing and I use subtitles/captions. I ordered seasons 1-5 of Adam-12; and now I read season 6-7 aren't subtitled? What gives?"
3,Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Technology,"The book is very well written. However, some sections as in thrust reversers and others do not deserve as much space as for example sections on turbines and compressors.Although the book is updated it still contains sections which are very out of date and have not changed from an earlier release."
4,"Pays Homage to Older Style, not Opaline","this is a great album, but you cant really compare it to opaline very well since its so different stylistically. dishwalla is an alternative rock band and this is a very very very good alternative rock CD, but opaline was something more, it touched upon something universal. i love certain tracks on the album, winter sun is among the most beautiful of dishwalla's songs and above the wreckage is pretty awesome, but this is rock. if you expected this CD to be a solid alt-rock album, you're in for a treat, but if you expected it to be another opaline you're going to be disappointed."
2,Nothing special - buy 3 Doors Down,"I can't understand why there are so many...well..untrue reviews.. maybe the guys sent there whole streetteam to attack amazon or what ever, this record is not that good like everyone is saying here...It is (except Ease The Moment and Collide) truly uninspired and they tried to hide it with way too many effects and what ever, it is really ""overproduced""... every track sounds like the one before and... well there is simply nothing of the real great dishwalla we had once..Buy 3 Doors Down or the two Songs mentioned before via iTunes but don't waste your money, it is even not worth the time you need for listening"
5,It really is that good!,"You need this cd. It has the songs, the performances, the edge......don't listen to peoples gripes about it not being like their earlier work. They are more polished, but they are also a much matured band, and the songs have an even greater depth than some of their earlier work (using Pet Your Friends as the example here). JR has never sounded better, in my opinion, and the band really lets loose on several of the tracks. My favorite tracks are Winter Sun, 40 Stories, Coral Sky, Ease The Moment and Far Away.This cd is fantastic from beginning to end and is the PERFECT successor to Opaline. The cd takes some of the best moments from Opaline and combines them with the edge of their ealier work, creating, what should be, the cd of the year.If you have never had the pleasure of seeing these guys live, you need to add it to your list of things to do in the near future. The live shows needs to be seen to fully appreciate the Dishwalla experience! Buy this cd!!!!"
1,"Why Dishwalla, why?","Some minor changes in the sound, and suddenly the magic is gone. i don't like the way that this album sounds, and I didn't even finish litening to be honest. There are som many good albums out there, some of them Dishwalla, that I simply don't have the time to listen to this. Please Dishwalla, make it better next time, as good as I know you can do!"
3,Good...but not Opaline!!,"As a really big fan of this band, I went out and purchased this as soon as my local retail store opened, and I very rarely buy from retail stores. While I definitely like it, I don't think it stands up to their last release...Opaline! I don't know...it is brand new...maybe I'll like it better after awhile, but with Opaline I liked it upon first listen and haven't gotten tired of it since. I guess it's pretty obvious that I like Opaline better, so if you're not real familiar with this band, get Opaline before this one. Having said all that, like the reviewer before me said, all of thier releases (which by the way is 5 total including the live release), are really good. Luckily for me, I live in So Cal, so I've been able to see them live numerous times, in fact, I'll be seeing them again in a couple of days...can't wait!"
2,disappointing,"Well, what can I say.... I love Dishwalla... I love every Song on every Album they did...But THIS is not Dishwalla... This is the trial of a too unknown band to become bigger, to get more money.. And so they lost everything they had..The first Single was oldschool Walla and that was the reason for me to buy the Album...Now I know why they called the Album ""Dishwalla"" because that is the only thing that reminds you that this is Dishwalla..Don't be a ""First-Single-Fool"", listen to the Album first than you can buy it if you like mainstream pop rock..."
5,"Wow, I never knew that!","Data Almanac 2006 seduces even the casual browser of statistics. During its first week on my desk, not a single visitor resisted the urge to peruse its extensive tables on American demographics. Surprise rankings got a, ""wow I never knew that"" and a playful search for more lists where our cities and ourselves rank highly or not at all. The table for cities with housing bubbles was an obvious first place to locate my native New York City. As the Data Almanac answers questions, it raises others. For customized statistic inquiries, the Data Almanac includes a loaded CD-ROM giving me the chance to make the stats more relevant to my particular research. It sure beats surfing ad nauseam on the web for poorly cited tables. Here, everything is legit and transparent as to where the numbers come from. You can't beat a simple tool like this with so much information."
4,Academic Administrator,"This book is good for the layperson, statistician, social scientist or those who are in specialized fields, looking at Population and Housing, Health, Education, Sex and Relationships, Economics and Business, Crime, America's ethnic make-up, etc... It's also a fun gift to present to a friend who is tech-savvy and would like to generate related stats with the variables given on the software or likes these type of social scientific data! As a joke but not really, where a man should move to get married to a woman?! Nice addition to any library, as these topics will peak most folks' interest. Very easy to read and thumb through and you can also contact the authors if you question a particular stat, which is what I did and received a comprehensive explanation."
1,Bland and boring,"This slim volume focuses on, or rather obsesses about, hapless and neurotic George Bland, who dithers constantly about the worth and meaning of his entire life, until the conniving Katy Gibb reorients his dithering to lust versus longing. If you enjoy that last bit of imititative, wandering prose, you may be able to stick with Brookner's story. But if you wish for her to tighten up the redundant and overly detailed writing about Bland's bland ruminations, it may be best to look elsewhere for entertainment."
2,Beyond Dull,"Though I find Brookner's writing elegant, the story itself was beyond dull. I'm sorry I took the time to finish this book. 200+ pages of the internal monologue of a grumpy, dull man taking walks. That's the entire book. The only reason I kept reading is the secret hope that George would freak out and kill Katy or something. No such luck."
4,it worked well,This was purchased for use by my husband who is recuperating from a stroke. We've only used this once so far and it worked well. Our PT thought the back needed to be tightened up but that part was pre-assembled and there was no way to tighten it up. I was extremely impressed with the delivery time.
1,cheap hardware,"The shower bench arrived with all the parts required to assemble it completely. After assembling the frame I found that the one seat only had one fastening insert that was threaded, the other was just a ring with no threads. While attempting to disassemble the bench the ring on one of the lock washers worked under the washer, causing me to strip the head of the bolt. Since I am now unable to take this piece of sh?$ apart, I am unable to return it for a refund.This may be the last item I purchase at Amazon!"
5,very helpful,This is a study bench which gives my mom the security for bath time . I had to buy longer screws to secure the handle.
5,Lovely doll - I wish I had her!,"Aurora's face is not a smiley-face, but a more 'normal' one, which I like. She wears a beautiful gown, and her hair is lovely. The picture is hideous - but pictures tend to twist what a doll looks like. She comes with a rather BORING comb, but the sweet plastic ring makes up for it."
1,Map scale is too large to be of any use,"I bought this map prior to a trip to Australia intending to use it while traveling. The scale is too large. If your doing a 6th grade report on Australia and need a good map for class, this map is perfect."
3,Not as described,"It's advertised as a pulpwood load: 52'Walters car. The picture shows a bulkhead flat car with a load. It should have only showed the load not the car. Also Walthers does not sell a 52' car that the load fits on. I had to cut 1/2"" off the cars to fit the Walthers flat car that they DO sell."
5,The best!,"Is there really a better bar than this one? Not sure - Clark bars are awesome too but I really, really love these 5th avenues. Been eating them for years and years and I'm SO glad that Hershey now has them. Wow, what a perfect marriage! Highly recommend!"
3,This was given as a gift.,I was thanked for it and I know nothing else.I assume it was all that was indicated by others who had received it.
4,Great for anyone serious about voice!,"This book contains solos for sopranos with a decent variance of vocal abilities and vocal range. Songs are in many different languages such as French, German, Italian and English. I used this book when I was a student and now that I am a teacher, it is required book for my students. This would be a great gift for a high school graduate studying music in college."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I used this book all the time in my voice lessons. The songs are really good in my voice, the appropriate amount of challenging, and are fun to learn."
1,Practically useless,"To read this book is a complete waste of time, at least if you are interested in technical information.Hundreds of pages dedicated to description of problems starting almost from the Creation, when there was, maybe, a vague similarity to what present technology can do, but no really good information for users or hobbysts.Go to other books and save a lot of money!"
5,A beautiful and touching story,"This is one of the best historical romances I have ever read. It intricately weaves the politics and history of 19th century India with a touching and beautiful love story. The characters of Laura and Ian were unforgettable. MJP is an incredible storyteller. She integrates history, politics, angst, and love into an incredibly enjoyable read."
5,Another great book from Amazon,"Each and every book by this author is so much fun to read. Not only are the books romantic, but contain a very interesting story as well. Can't wait for the next one. Thanks Amazon for carrying these books."
4,Not as good as the first two in the trilogy,"This book was a bit too slow for my taste. There was too much emphasis on adventure and India and too little romance. For too long nothing happened between heroes. It wasn't explained how Ian's impotence was cured, he just woke up one day and was cured. Well, apart from that, it was a nice, complex book, with a great hero and heroine, lots of passion, troubled past, healing, overcoming ones fears, wonderful secondary characters... Even though it's not Mary Jo Putney's best, it is still much better than other author's best books, and I still recommend it to anyone who wants to read a sizzling, exotic romance novel."
2,.,There is no possible way for a book in this genre not to be predictable so the quality of the book depends on how interesting the conflict is...this book had nearly none.Putney does flip an old cliche in this one but in it she lost everything that made it interesting.
2,OVERPRICED,"This product is way overpriced!!! There is barely any candy in this box!! I should have gone to the store and bought the candy and made my own box.... I bet I could have made 4 of them for this price. The box is not even nice, it's plain, just a piece of paper saying Happy 80th Birthday on it. I mean at least give me a box that's decorated with things from that era. I obviously would not recommend this product!"
4,Pretty soothing.,"I have super dry eyes since I wear contacts a lot and these help so much! I put them in about once a day, and my eyes have stopped developing that really strange oily film."
5,Great for dry eyes!,I have been using this product for about a year and it is great for mild to moderate dry eyes.
5,My favorite artificial tear,"For some reasons my eyes get very dry every once a while. Sometimes it's allergic that artificial tear doesn't help a lot, but sometimes this is all I need. I haven't tried all brands available in the market, but for the ones I have tried, Visine is the best. I don't know what makes it stand out because the ingradients look almost identical to others, but I only need one drop a day of Visine, and multiple drops of other brands I tried."
1,Does NOT reduce redness of my eyes only foggs my sight,"Another disappointment. Hoped for a solution to my chronic red eyes. Was hoping they'll look nice and bright again.However, after trying a few times this product, it only aggravated my eyes and fogged up my vision, causing me to feel dizzy and burning sensation in my eyes. Had to rinse them out with salted water to get rid of head ache it started causing.Only tears i got were those of pain and disappointment."
1,FALSO EGOSENTRICO,ESTE LIBRO ES FALSO !! NO GASTEN SU DINERO EN ESTE LIBRO !! HAY MUCHAS COSAS QUE ELLA CUENTA QUE NO CONCUERDADN CON LA PALABRA DE DIOS ... ESE LIBRO TRAE CONFUCION PARA EL QUE NO TIENE DICERNIMIENTO QUE LASTIMA QUE HAIGAN PERSONAS QUE LUCRAN .. CON EL NOMBRE DE JESUS !! COMO LO HACE ESTA MUJER !! QUE DIOS TENGA MISERICORDIA ...
1,I was lied to!!!,I ordered this specifically for my 2008 Toyota Tacoma. It instructed a no drilling installation. Amazon assured me it was the right part for my truck. When I received it and tried to install it it did not fit! Every excessory I have ordered from Amazon for my vehicle has never worked! Then they charge me for return shipping on their mistake! I will never again order auto accessories from Amazon! I'm not a naive shopper by the way. I know how to order parts. SHAME ON AMAZON AND AFFILIATES FOR ALLOWING THIS!
3,pressjocky,"not a bad replacement for the original. the unit plugged in snugly for 2 weeks then did'nt so i crimped the male adapter and it works. the next issue is, when the adapter is connected, the apple profiler say's it is only a 45watt NOT A 65watt which in most cases does'nt matter, but when i rip dvdsthe battery does not charge as fast as drain. over-all not bad for the price."
5,learned to be me,"I read all of these books when I was a young man in my 20's(I am now 57), when I had a lot of questions about self-worth, my direction in life and my station in life. These books helped me to establish a courage to be ME despite what other's might think, to appreciate the qualities that I own, characteristics that I have, to appreciate my OWN UNIQUE EXISTENCE(there is only one ME!). Now with the existence of so much bullying of our kids(and adults) and suicides of young adults, everyone should read this. If you read one, you will read them all!"
2,GE Review,"This phone was purchased for an elderly household based on a referral. The problem encountered was with the speakerphone quality. The phone was purchased with priority on the speakerphone for a specific usage. The sound broke up intermittenly during the entire transmission. There were too many buttons for a senior user, causing confusion and frustration."
3,NOT AS SHOWN,Good quality but not that of a $500 comforter set. I have purchased many from competitors such as JC Penney with just as good quality or better.
5,Fabulously Unique,"I get so many compliments on this watch - it is different than any other watch I've ever seen. I actually own 3 of them, 2 silver (cream face and black face) and 1 gold (brown face). These will be the last watches I ever buy. If you can find it from Chelsea Watch it will be a fabulous deal!"
3,Falling just a bit short of high expectation.,"As a long time Lonely Planet fan, I've often cited and sworn by their guidance. The CitySync USA Springboard Module falls just a bit short of what I would have expected from them.The module is small and fits inline nicely with a Visor and I wasn't able to tell much loss in battery life. Content is easily and quickly accessed and found. More importantly most all the lonely planet book(s) content is duplicated in the card. So the four cities are pleasantly at hand. A 5th city is yours to download when you register, though it resides in your handheld and not the card.Though, I'm not sure if I can find a review of a map location. Say if one were to click on a point of interest on a map, you can't readily pull up its review. Which brings my second point, the interface is quite unattractive and cluttered.But if you are a lonley planet addict as I am, its definatly worth having...though you'll still need Vindigo installed for street navigation."
2,Too old,"The problem with this set is that it is 11 years old, and much of the language is simply out of date. Not just the slang, but many grammatical points are no longer currently in use. The tapes are also muffled -- with the new technologies available and the changes in Hebrew, the publishers should produce a new version."
2,"Much promise, limited realization","I bought this years ago before my first trip to Israel in 1995. It of course got buried and not used. A couple of years later I studied Hebrew at an ulpan here in Los Angeles. I've supplemented ulpan studies with tapes, videos, and lots of books. The Pimsleur series is very good. ""Aval"" ... this Barron's series is a disappointment for many reasons.The biggest is: It's on tape. Good grief ... with technology where it is, why is anything being (re)produced on cassettes anymore? Oy! The recording quality is ""kacha-kacha"", and the grammar and choice of words is very different than what I learned in ulpan and what I'm continuing to imbibe.Parts of the tapes ARE semi-helpful, where the grammar/vocab are near up-2-date .... it does help with my listening skills.Overall, get the Pimsleur set (but let them know we all want a Level 2)."
2,"Probably great for its time,but....","I was interested in learning Hebrew to converse with the suprising numbers of Hebrew speakers in my neighborhood. (Upper East Side of Manhattan). I looked at Encounters in Modern Hebrew series, but there was no indication of stress for each of the words. So I bought this set... I did the first dialogue and wanted to show off to my Israeli primary care doctor... boy was I embarassed!! The language presented here is way too old to be respectable any more. Pimsleur is a good alternative,but they only have one level."
3,Seems good so far . . .,"After a few months of listening to the tapes while driving, I am happy enough with this book. Unlike the few weeks I spent with another course, I feel like I'm learning how to speak/write/read a language -- not, simply, to be a tourist. If the text and tapes are out of date, so be it. I cannot image they are that ""off.""I do have one large concern, however. It's the poor quality of type in the textbook. It appears to be a copy of an old manuscript. Worse, one that was done in a font that does not lend itself to reproduction. As a result, its difficult (for me, at least) to tell the difference between the dalets (D's) and the reishes (R's), as well as between the bets (B/V's) and kafs (Kh's). It may be that after more time, I'll get used to it.As to the tape quality, it sounds fine to me. True, the enunciations could be clearer. But, in the real world, that's true too."
1,I hope no more diplomats are trained this way,"I bought this set because I am a polyglot; however, I think my set was missing a decoder ring or something! The Hebrew spoken on this set is not only muffed at best, but also out of date. Just like the Standard American English of today is much different than that of 15 years ago, so is the Israeli Hebrew in this set. If you're someone that already speaks Hebrew, this might help refresh your memory. To those trying to learn Hebrew, I suggest using this series only if you have a native speaker of Israeli Hebrew on hand to bring you up to speed on where the vocabulary and grammar are currently."
2,Season has an even WORSE ending than the L Word....disappointed...,The LNF show became one of my favorite shows when I first started watching the episodes on youtube so naturally when Season 4 was set to be released I couldn't wait to see what happened..and now I'm can't believe how disappointing it turned out to be..I won't spoil it for everyone who hasn't had the chance to watch it yet..but I will say the editing was just as bad if not worse than the last 3 seasons..the storylines were a little up and down and off and on..it leaves you with so many questions at the end it's ridiculous..I was expecting alot better but you get what you pay for I guess..I just hope there's a season 5 to followup otherwise following this entire season has been a complete waste..just as the L Word ended their last season in the worst way possible..LNF is a definite runner up..
4,A Refreshing Edge To The Stories Told!,It was refreshing and interesting to see characters that looked like me in reality situation that I could relate.. I definitely want to see more of these ladies and this sit come in the future. I recommended this sit come to my friends.
4,Cerebrally stimulating and very esoteric,"In Ainu Dreams, poet George Quasha and buun, a Japanese artist living in America, collaborate in poetically manifesting the artist's richly articulated dream-life. These eighty-odd poems embody an ever-opening cosmos of curious image, surprising narrative and enigmatic teaching in a language no one could have dreamed up alone. It is a remarkable collaboration which serves to give sustenance and distinction to what is dreamt what is real and what can be. Cerebrally stimulating and very esoteric this is one of the best books of the year!Leslie BlanchardEditor A Writer's Choice Literary Journal ISSN: 1521-2319"
1,Not what they show,This is for ONE gasket not the 10 that they show. I believed the picture was not correct but figured at least they would be for the 4 required for a vw 1600 engine. Rock Auto sells them for 18 cents a piece.
4,"The Book ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"".","A weird but moving synthesis of tragedy, grief,absurdity and humor. Sometimes the author's free associative style of writing leaves the reader baffled. The story unfolds through the eyes of the 7 year old son of his recently deceased father. The son struggles valiantly to symbioticly reconnect with his dead father. The father unexpectedly died in the 9-11 tragedy. Other such tragedies are brought to mind. The strength of the book lies in the witty way in which a son searches to find connection with his dead father. Worth reading."
3,A Really Bizarre Read,"The concept for this book was very clever, but it was hard to read. I almost gave up on it a few times."
5,earns its quirkiness honestly,"I am a fan of Foer's last novel and I admit to being excited about the new tome. I found it to be as unusual as his previous work, but for all his wackiness in character and printing techniques and description, I just loved this book. It comes by its quirkiness honestly and is not just wunderkind posturing that some of the McSweeney writers are criticized for. Also, this book deals with 9/11 in a human and human-sized way instead of the movie-sized treatment and overwrought jingoism we're attuned to. I was happy to see a story about 9/11 that was more about one boy's response to losing his father than using of the story as a sort of tragedy porn for consumers of a media product. That said, the story is only tangentially about something; the true star of Foer's novels is the characterization. I feel in love a little bit with every character in this book, many of them old or aging and very different than myself. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
4,"love,loss and reconciliation",Such complicated emotional material woven into a story for all generations who have loved and been loved and will always be loved...
2,Couldn't finish it,"Book Club read this... 1 loved the book, 3 hated it, and 2 of us couldn't get it finished. There may have been a story here, but too much contrived 'noise' to get to it. Movie was better, but with millions of other things to read, why bother? I suspect the 911 connection is what is getting the attention, not stellar storytelling or brilliant characterizations. I really wanted to like it. :("
2,Extremely Boring and Incredibly Chaotic,"I have been an avid reader since childhood. There is never a time when I don't have a book in progress. I started reading this book and every time I pick it up, I tell myself that it is going to start getting better. But, it doesn't! I can almost grasp the parts pertaining to Oskar, but the Grandparent storyline is just not catching on. I am going to put the book down, start another and maybe eventually go back to this one. Maybe I will have better luck the next go round."
2,overrated,"Whilst this novel has temporal relevance, its style is clumsy and it is difficult to relate to the characters in a way that has relevence in a bigger picture context of the bombing of the twin towers event. Very ""americana"" parochial"
1,Most confusing book I've ever read,This book was the most confusing book I have ever read. The main characters had so many flawsI had a difficult time believing in them. The writer and Hollywood producers need to look at newjobs.
2,"Love the book, but it's not for Kindle.","This book was excellent, just the type of well-crafted thinking person's book that appeals to me. Sadly, there were several pages of what I suspect were PDFs that just didn't translate well to the Kindle.I wish there were a way I could give the book itself five stars and the Kindle version one star. I give two stars to make certain those who are going to buy for Kindle will see.The book was one of those that, after I finished reading it, I started again at the beginning. I can see how it would make a great movie.I wish I'd known about the problem with the Kindle version before I bought, however. I'd have bought the hardback.Yes, it's that good!"
5,Love This Book,"Though this book is very different from Foer's first one, I loved it just as much! Truly should be experienced by everyone!"
4,"Touching and quirky book, but not good on Kindle","I really loved the story of Oskar Schell as well as his personality. I was less enamored with the lengthy story of his grandparents that intertwines with his. The story of Oskar is creative and unusual. The story of the grandparents got a little heavy-handed. Crucially, Kindle readers should know that one long chapter of this book - one very important chapter - is nigh impossible to read on a Kindle. I had to take off my glasses, put my eye one inch from the page and get a throbbing headache."
1,Extremely pretentious and incredibly frustrating!,"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a novel that I couldn't tolerate to say the least. I don't know if the book is different from the movie, but I got to say that this book is completely unreadable! I wanna know what kind of ""substance"" the author of this novel was on when he wrote this rambling, confusing, and highly bizarre story! I found the main character Oskar to be incredibly annoying. This book made my head hurt and the weird, graphic photos was one of the main reasons I stopped reading this book. If you like confusing, contrived novels then this one is for you...if you don't then please pass on this one!"
1,"Please, Mommy, make the bad clown stop","I implore anyone who enjoyed, or found meaning, in this book -- or, for that matter, is considering purchasing it -- to find themselves a copy of ""See Under:Love"" (or, frankly, anything David Grossman has ever written) and discover that from which Foer has been so blatantly plagerizing his entire career.That Foer is now considered one of our young literary lions is a betrayal of those principles -- creativity, insight, deeper truth -- that true literature is supposed to embody. If T.S. Eliot was correct to argue that great artists don't imitate, but rather, steal, then Foer is a great artist. By any other standard, he falls short."
1,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,This novel is extremely difficult to read and drags with flashbacks that are difficult to determine who's flashback the writer is talking about. The conversations are difficult as there is so little punctuation the reader is confused as to who is talking. There are two many stories within the story and the characters never come alive. This could have been a much better book as the premise for this story had great promise. I would not purchase a book by this author again.
2,Nine going on thirty...,"While I liked the idea of the novel, I found Oskar (the nine year old protagonist) to be unrealistic and not very likable. The story of a little boy haunted by his father's death during the 9/11 attacks, and his quest to learn more about his dad via a mysterious key has potential. Extremely Loud fell flat because it does not feel genuine or realistic, but a little contrived and overdone. I really wanted to like this book, but the characters are so flimsy: what mother in her right mind would let a 9 year old wander around NYC alone? Oskar does not sound like a real child, its as if Foer forgot that his protagonist was only 9 and not 30. I also had a hard time with Foer's writing style: the dialogue is condensed into paragraphs and you have no idea who is talking half the time...very confusing and it took me out of the story at times."
1,Extremely Tedius and Incredibly Lacking,"The most precocious nine-year-old on the planet is interviewing every person with the last name of Black in NYC. Why? His father, who died in the WTC tragedy, left a blue vase in his closet. The vase held a key in a small brown envelope with the word ""black"" on it. The boy assumes that ""black"" refers to a person's last name hence the interviews. He is convinced that locating this person will lead to finding out exactly how his father really died.I read the book all the way to the end because I thought that surely there would be a point to page after page after page of precocious non-punctuated musings by this boy. Unfortunately, there was no point to the musings.I suggest you save your money because there is no closure at the end of the book. It is a rambling, long-winded, and twisted tale.Not since John Grisham's ""The Client"" has there been such a character in a boy's body but with the mind of 40-year-old man. Both are equally preposterous."
1,Calculated Pretense,Middle brow aspirational fiction from a young novelist intent on shaping a career. Want something authentic? Do you like narratives that tell a story rather than try to impress with erudition? Read John Twelve Hawks' THE TRAVELER.
1,Extremely boring and Incredibly Indulgent,"You are not supposed to say anything negative about the book if there are 9/11 victims. This book is very indulgent(what a clever little fellow that author) while at the same time managing to be exceedingly boring. You'd be much better off to watch ""Home Alone II"", at least it's funny."
2,OK but....,I didn't like any of the characters. I felt bad for Oskar but he was so annoying I just didn't care what happened to him.
2,Calling Steven Spielberg!!!,"This is a book for three kinds of people:1) 18-24 year olds who haven't read (or appreciated) much great literature2) People who read the occasional novel on plane trips or vacations3) People who usually read lots of romance/mystery/chick lit/self help books and occasionally read popular literature.This is not a book for people who consume regular doses of current and classic literature. This is not a book for people who regularly read and enjoy the high quality of newspapers and magazines like the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Atlantic, Harpers, Slate and Salon et al. In fact, it is an insult and a waste of time.Oskar Schell is an irritating and contrived little (......)."
5,From one who loved it,"As another reviewer said, this is one of those books you either love or hate. I absolutely loved it. The story touched my heart. It made me laugh, it made me cry. I couldn't put it down."
5,Beautiful,"Beautiful book and an extremely engaging read, does, however, stretch the boundaries of believability and often requires the reader to readily jump into the abstract outcries of human emotion. Highly recommended and in my humble opinion better than ""Everything is Illuminated""."
3,EXTERMELY LOUD and INCREDIBLY CLOSE;A NOVEL,"I didn't care for the novel very much,it had alot of chapters that didn't make since to me.it kept going back and forth over years and was very confusing.about the grandmothers weirdness and the grandfather not talking,it was not a very entertaining book.I'm sure the movie was much better."
2,"Incredibly loud, and extremely close","Weird book, I hope the movie is better. I do not find this book interesting. It jumps all over the place, and unless I am missing something it is probably the most bizarre books I have ever read."
2,extremely loud and incrediblt close,I had a difficult time following the story line. It seemed to jump around from current events to years ago and didnt connectI didnt even finish the book-I returned it
2,Tina is a better Fey,"At times the writing is inventive and almost lyrical, but on the whole the book is as precocious as its preposterous characters. It starts somewhere with imaginative potential and quickly begins to go nowhere. Unresolved links and blind hints everywhere, but nothing ever really happens. In the end the book is fey and undisciplined, having nothing to do with the real and multi-faceted agony inherent in 9/11. Shame on the author and the publisher.Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (Movie Tie-In): A Novel"
1,Waste of time,This book was a total waste of time. It boggles my mind to see how popular it is. Don't waste your money.
2,Disappointed,"Unfortunately, I have to say that the best thing about this book was the realistic-looking cover of the young boy. I kept reading in hopes that this story would get better but it never did. There was no way to tell who was saying what in this novel. It all seemed to run together and it made the story confusing. The big mystery of the lock the boy was trying to find ended up being insignificant to the entire storyline.I'm sure the movie will be much better, but only because Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks are in it; the plot will still stink unfortunately. So, I will be waiting to watch the movie when it is released on DVD and I will rent it for $1.20 at REDBOX...anything more than that would be a waste. I was really hoping this would be a good story; I'm thinking the advertisements are playing it up way too much and most will feel just as disappointed. I hate giving bad reviews...but this one deserves it really. Sorry Mr. Foer...but this one just wasn't for me."
2,How Far Have the Mighty Fallen....,"Let's see. Steal a little from the Tin Drum, a little from I Seem to Be A Verb. Fill it with images and typographical stunts to fill it out and make it seem like a novel. Lots of ads in major media outlets. Flashy cover. Stories about cash advances in the press. But don't believe the hype. Dull and unreadable. Meandering and ultimately trite. Certainly his financial success is not his fault, but sad to think that this is foisted as the best and brightest of new American literature."
2,difficult,"I heard nothing but good things about the movie, which I didn't see, so decided to read the book. It was extremely difficult and frustrating to read. I quit reading the book which I don't normally do. I would not recommend this book to read."
2,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close:A Novel,This is the hardest plot/story line to follow. It bounces around in time and lacks threads. The author did capture the dyslexic mind of a teenager but it made for a dyslexic reading experience. The Tom Hanks movie trailers suggested an interesting story but I wouldn't buy this book--get it at a free library if it interests you.
2,Not so good,This book went in all different directions. I found it very difficult to stay with the story. I did not finish the book as it just did not flow.
2,Unexpected,"This book was not at all what I expected. Did not enjoy it, it was very obscure, disjointed, hard to follow, and if there was a big message, don't think I got it! Would not recommend - don't see how they made a movie of it!"
2,Not exciting,"Many people have written sophisticated, long reviews of this book. Mine is very simple. If I'm not excited about coming back home from work just to continue the book I'm reading, the book is not good enough for me. If I have to force myself to pick it up and read it just for the sake of finishing the book, it's not good enough for me.....so, I stopped half way through.Clearly, some others love the book, so try for yourself."
4,Beautiful book,This book is so well-written. I found myself re-reading certain phrases because I loved how he just strung his words together
5,Amazing!!!!,This is an amazing and heartfelt book that I finished in two days as I could not put it down!
1,Too Clever for Its Own Good,"This was a swing and a miss. Safran struck out. His approach to a national tragedy was a bit too clever for my taste. Intellectual puzzles and cute games don't come close to capturing the raw emotion of the event. The end of the book essentially is a flip book made from the famous set of pictures of a man jumping out of the WTC... The author should focus his cleverness on amusements, not global tragedies. Jonathan, we know you're smart, but smartness isn't everything."
2,Disturbing,"Although I heard this book was funny, I found nothing amusing about the book or the subject matter. I did not particularly care for the artistic elements, i.e. the photographs. I was very disturbed while I read the book and did not enjoy it all. However, that being said, in retrospect it was not as bad as I thought while reading it. I would not, however, recommend it."
3,Disappointing,I started off enjoying this book but after a few chapters I grew incredibly bored. I thought the photos in the book weren't neccessary and I eventually bored of reading about the characters that the boy in the story meets. They werent even interesting at all. Halfway towards the book I began skimming over the pages that described the characters. I found the story about his grandmother and grandmother a lot more interesting then finding the lock. That should have been a whole other book altogether. The ending was disapointing and I finished the book feeling like I wished I hadn't read this book in the first place.
2,Tedious Babbling,"The author tries so hard to be creative, cute and original. This gimmicky book lacks depth despite trying to be profound. The author hides his poor writing skills behind the unusual format of this book. Don't waste your time and money on this book."
2,Extremely Flimsy and Incredibly Pretentious,"Like most leftists and prodigies, Jonathan (""Safran"") Foer REALLY loves himself and his writing.""Extremely Loud"" is a simplistic novel in which Foer exploits a horrific event to give it much needed gravitas. The main character, who often sounds mentally retarded, goes on a near-impossible and almost ridiculous quest to find the owner of a key in the small and unpopulated town known as Manhattan. The reader will find lots of visual gimmicks, but the novel failed to provide any resolution. Most revolting are the final pages which show images of a poor soul jumping from the World Trade Center. But it is more than that. Remember that we're dealing with a grossly insensitive Foer who is very satisfied with his creativity, and when the reader flips the final pages, the reader sees the victim is actually flying UP. I'm not sure an author could be more disrespectful in tampering with such a painful image."
1,Garbage,"Another slick piece of stool from NewYork. It's not just thatit's illiterate but that his publisher and relatives had tocon everyone with these 4-star ratings. This ""thing"" (itdoesn't deserve to be called a book) has no point, no plot,and a robot character. Send it as a gift to people who can'tafford toilet paper."
2,Kindle formatting impossible to read!,Novel was interesting but beware of Kindle formatting since it is impossible to read in spots! There are many photos which slow the Kindle down and one section was unreadable because the font was so small and a light grey ink with no response to adjusting the font. If I knew this ahead of time I would have bought a traditional book!
2,Confused in TN,I found this incredibly hard to read. I had to watch the movie for it to make sense. I don't recommend this book.
3,summer reading,i had to read this because it was required for school this year. its an okay book but i would not have read this if i didnt have to.
2,Hard To Read,I tried several times to read this book and just couldn't finish it. It was so very difficult to keep track of who I was reading about. Too frustrating for me. I wish I had read some of the reviews before attempting to read the book.
2,Rambled on and I couldn't get into it,"I really wanted to like this book, but after reading 1/3rd I just couldn't get into it. I heard the movie wasn't good, but since I love Sandra Bullock and prefer to read a book before seeing the movie I decided to read this book. For me, the book was just a lot of rambling. It was hard to follow all of the conversations, partly due to the poor writing style and mostly due to the numerous conversations throughout the book. Even if I dislike a book, I try to at least finish it to give it a fair chance, but this book just wasn't worth my time to do that."
2,Not what I expected,"I mised seeing the movie when it came to town, so I decided to read the book. I did not like it. It was very weird and disconnected. I would not recommend it."
3,Disaster Nosalgia,"I actually thought this worked better as a movie. regardless, as someone in NYC on 9/11, I don't like revisiting this subject. That's my problem, not Foer's, but this book seemed a bit twee for the subject."
3,"ultimately moving, but what a messy read","Yes, the author is talented. His prose is unconventional and stylish. But this book is proof there can be too much of a good thing. This sad and beautiful story of a sensitive boy coping with the loss of his father in the 9/11 attack on the WTC is memorable. But I found the author's delivery of the narrative to be extremely tiresome, much like in his Everything Is Illuminated (.. a better book). It sucks all the enjoyment out of reading.Bottom line: a powerful story told in a messy way."
5,EXTREMELY REWARDING; INCREDIBLY WELL-WRITTEN,"I regret that Robert Altman died, for he is probably the best director to bring this tale to the screen (I'm anxious to see this realized as a film.) This tale of a young boy trying to solve the mystery of a key he has found is alternately funny and tragic. The visuals included are unique and appropriate. The time may come when we no longer want to be exposed to takes on the 9/11 tragedy, but that time is not yet here, and this book offers a unique perspective on it. Prepare to be challenged."
2,Book Club Selection,"This was a book that was for a book club review and discussion. I was very pleased that I had also seen the movie first otherwise I would have had a difficult time understanding this book. Most unfortunately this was the first book that I had read on my kindle. It was not conducive to a kindle as the book had sections of irregular type, pages of numerals and distorted words and paragraphs. I had to use a magnifying glass in some instances. I did not want to keep increasing and decreasing the font on my kindle. That put me off the kindle as well as the book."
1,Extremely loud and incredibly close,I didn't enjoy this book. I couldn't even get into to it. My book club did it and we all found it difficultTo read. Most of us didn't finish it.
3,Interesting concept,"The concept for the book is interesting, but I found it difficult to sympathize with the young protagonist. His thought processes and speech patterns seemed forced, and as a result his character seemed like a 30 year old man pretending to be an 11-year old. That being said, I did enjoy the book at times."
3,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Coose,"This book was very different,and all over the place. I had times ,when I had know idea who the person was that was talking.The ending left me saying "" THATS IT"""
3,Moves haphardly between themes.....but definitely interesting,"The story is about a boy searching for the meaning of a mysterious key that belonged to his father, a man that perished on 9/11. That being said, it would have been enough to write a touching story with that premise. The author, however, changes writing styles throughout the book. He lets the readers read letters written by the boy's grandmother and grandfather. These have not much to do with the actual story line, though they add depth to knowing the boy's family. I actually found that the letters weren't that necessary to the story, or at the very least, that that part of the story could have been presented in a more direct manner.That being said, the story was good, but not great. If you are looking for a book that ""tugs at your heartstrings,"" then I would recommend it."
2,could not read some pages,"I downloaded this book in anticipation of a great read. Did not happen. The content was ok but hard to decipher some of the characters and overall I found this book to be jumbled and confusing. There were lots of shifts and starts and stops between the ""now"" and the ""then"". To top that off, it did not download many of the pages so I could read them, no matter how I changed the print size. Was a disappointment to say the least."
3,Another good book with no ending,"I would love to recommend this book, but as it just abruptly ends (I had the ebook and honestly thought something had gone wrong), I just can't tell anyone to read it. I feel like I'm wandering around, waiting to finish it, BUT I CAN'T, because THERE'S NO ENDING! Very disappointing."
3,"Incredibly Close, but Extremely Off","The book takes place after the death of a nine-year-old boy's father in the 9/11 tragedy. The author presents the boy as extremely smart, but extremely naive due to age. The first problem I found with this book is that it jumped around at awkward points where one moment it presented the boy's story and the next it is talking about a completely different person that the author does not even give thought to introduce. The other problem I found was the weird development of character the author puts on the kid where the boy self-harms (through bruising) and the author's strange implications of humor of the boy's innocence makes it harder to digest than it is to enjoy. Overall, I asked for a book and got another poorly done daytime soap opera, and that just does not sit well with me.You guys may want it, but you can keep it."
3,just so-so,This was not my favorite book. The ending is very anti-climatic. I expected more after all the hype surrounding the book/movie
2,Too slow..,"I generally pick books at random and didn't have any idea what this book was about when I bought it. At first it seemed interesting when I discovered that it was about 9/11, but that quickly changed into mild annoyance. The characters all seem insane and I can't relate to any of them. The boy's grandmother or grandfather (It was a bit hard to follow) talked about using certain spaces in their apartment as private or 'invisible' spaces, or something like that, and the couple would get confused about which spaces they were invisible in, and they were so modest that they couldn't see eachother naked, they had to be in the 'invisible' space to change their clothes, etc. I just don't get it. I didn't read too much past that. It seemed like everyone in the story was screwed up in some way. It was a waste of money in my opinion beause I will probably never finish it."
3,Very Strange,"I found this book very hard to follow it skips all over the place, I am a little over half way through with the book and am going to make myself finish it, hoping it will begin to make more sense as I go along. I would not recommend it for a good read. It is difficult to stay interested in the book. It is certainly not what I was expecting."
1,not good,this is a horrible book. it jumps around and you never know who is talking. i wish i had seen the movie before i read the book. i think i would have liked the book if i had of. it was just too jumbled.
1,I'd give it ZERO stars if I could!,"The absolute worst book I've ever read. If I didn't know better, I'd think someone took two or three random books and threw them together into one. Not only is it disjointed and nonsensical, it isn't even mildly interesting. I don't understand how it got published."
2,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,I did not like this book mainly because it was very hard to follow. Especially if you put it down for a couple of days and then started reading again. It was hard to figure out which character I was previously reading about. I did not like the book.
2,better read german authors,"Foer tries to imitate great Today`s German Writers and even dares to choose the bombing of Dresden as literal theme. Naturally, he knows nearly nothing about the subject. Some tricks might help? So he talks about the destroyed zoo, assuming animals are equal everywhere at any time. Ridiculous. No american author will ever reach european, specially german qualities in writing about WW II. Wouldnt the U.S. be such an arrogant and narcisstic nation, they'd choose to learn instead of ignore. This book would have hardly found a publishers house in europe. It is full of bad immature tricks and gimmicks, without much substance. Vengan writing."
1,EXTREMELY BORING AND INCREDIBLY LONG,If you have absolutely nothing to do and would love to waste 10 hours of your life -- then this is the book for you!
1,School project gone wrong,"I think this book is a shamless disgraze and the teacher that made my kid read this as his summer reading asignment needs to be fired... i wonder if he ever read this book. The language is foul, and it all around confusing, there is no flow to it ...I'm just disgusted.hdhotchick...Mom of a 15 year old and mad mom on a mission right now"
3,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close: A Novel,"This over all was a good book, but it was very hard to follow and it took a long time to figure out."
1,Boring,Story hopped around too much. It was difficult to follow changes in character voices. A few chapters would spark some interest and make me think I could begin to enjoy the book but the senselessness would set in again. Hated the characters found none of them likeable. The ending was also a let down. Upset with myself for wasting my time on this one.
1,Not interesting,"This book was not good at all. I couldn't get into in, wish I could return and get my money back."
3,Compelling but Contrived Read,"I found the book moving and disturbing. How does one write about the impact on a son of his father's death on 9/11? Kudos to Foer for trying. The book is important to read so that we remember those who died and the loved ones who were left.I had problems with the writing style. Adopting an original style is fine, but I found it detracted from my reading. If Foer was attempting to mimic the state of mind of his characters, he succeeded, but at the expense of his readers.Oskar's character is well-done. He is gifted and grieving, but tenacious. He will not stop until he finds the secret of the key. The disconnect between he and his mother bothered me. I know it is resolved in the end, but he needed nurture and support that he didn't perceive."
4,"Enjoyed the book, but a bit too fancy for its own good","When I first got the book, I was drawn to the poetic language and the intriguing premise. But when I started to read it -- I couldn't get through it. It seemed purposely confusing.Recently, I picked up the book again and couldn't put it down. I loved the lyrical passages of prose poetry. One thing that bugged me was all the letters in the book. Because many of the letters were not signed or directed to someone -- it becomes a puzzle trying to figure out who is writing to whom. I think it would've been just as good to have clearer authorship of the letters. I found the precocious protoganist bratty but endearing. The pictures and typography were fun. I wish sometimes Foer's books worked on smaller canvases. Sept 11th is a big enough subject for me without throwing in the Dresden bombing too. But overall, I enjoyed the book. Especially once I was halfway through it and I'd gotten my bearings."
5,"What is it about, really?","Well, yes... the book is about an inventive boy and a search and all that. The other reviewers are right in superficial way. The book is really about this; that loving is painful, but that not loving is much more painful. This book is about love, which is not really surprising. Safran Fore's librarian in his last novel, Everything is Illuminated, remarked ""But all the books are about love.""This one certainly is."
1,strange,"This was one of the strangest books i ever read. Spent most of the time trying to understand what was going on. It jumps all over the place and after about 1/4 way through, i gave up."
2,I really wanted to like this Book,"Just found it very scattered and confusing. Realize this may be what the author was aiming for, but I had to read it twice to be able to follow. The constant repetition of certain phrases was annoying. Parts of it were really touching and reflected the horror of 9/11 well but found it hard to read because of the writing style."
3,Not for Kindle,This book contains many pages from the narrators scrap book. The are important to the story and you can't see them on the Kindle because it won't enlarge the pictures enough to make them legible.
1,EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE,Much too draggy. Too many blank pages. Really hard to follow. Not sure where the book was going. Didn't enjoy this one.
4,Definitely worth reading,"A very touching, smart and psychologically interesting story. I would nevertheless recommend to buy a paper version as pictures and fonts mean a lot in this book."
3,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Cose,"Great story, difficult to read at times and difficult to follow. I've watched the movie also, starring Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock and found this much better - more succinct, with unnecessary parts removed, simplified and beautified. Lovely idea!"
1,boring,was expecting something completely different. beginning is laughable to a point and extremely hard to concentrate on story as you don't know what's going on. overall- movie was better and that's not saying much
3,Interesting Book,"This book, jumps from character to character and gets confusing and very sad at times. Its well written and shows the journey of grief though the story of a son, a mother and a father."
2,Story is great but too much to get there,"I realize that all of the ""noise"" around the story line is purposeful in terms of the family's mental state, but this book was just too much work to get to the real story, which was actually quiet beautiful. Not my kind of book..."
4,certainly unique....and moving!,"I just finished a Kindle version of this book. It was without a doubt the most unique book I have ever read!! I was lost at times but finally fell into the mode of writing and thinking and writing and thinking. As I said this is unique. It was so well written that I could feel like the child in the book....especially at the very end. As Oskar cried....and his mother....so did I!I'm sure not all people would like this or even be able to follow the story....but for me it was a fantastic, moving journey!!"
5,Great book,I enjoyed the book. It had a lot more detail that the movie was able to portray. I would recommend this book.
3,Love it or hate it...,"I had heard that this book was absolutely amazing. I was so excited to read it. We just picked it for book club and I was prepping for surgery, so I was psyched- I would actually get to read it. As I started the book, I was extremely confused. I figured it would explain everything within the first few chapters. But it didn't. I felt confused during most of the book. I felt that it jumped around way too much and it was way too slow moving. The letters were confusing- you don't know who is writing it until you are well into the letter. I finally gave up on reading the book and watched the movie (which I liked a lot more) in order to be ready for book club. I am not one to not finish a book, so I did end up going back and finishing the book... but overall I was very disappointed with the book."
4,Quirky and Sad,"Having recently finished Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close a week ago, I find myself still thinking about it. As a person who was also a lonely strange kid, I could relate to Oskar, and felt that the character's (sometimes humorous) idiosyncracies provided a balance for the general depressing tone of the story. Oskar's search for anything that would bring his father closer to him reveals a deep sense of grief and loss, or as he calls it, ""heavy boots."" Oskar's loss is in parallel to his grandparents' story. which involves the bombing of Dresden in WWII. Some of the sections dealing with his grandparents slowed the book down in the middle, but the end of the book was very affecting for me. I recommend this book."
3,It surprises you.,"Reading the first Chapter, I was constantly reminded of the title, ""What the..."" because that is what I kept saying to myself as I was trying to make sense of what was going on. After a couple of chapters I was drawn to the characters and was anxious to see how their life would unfold. I know the author has received criticism for the use of pictures and drawings in the book, I think they only helped the reader develop a connection to the characters. I started the book thinking I would not like it and it surprises me that in the end I enjoyed it very much."
4,Fantastic book!,"This novel is a nice tribute to those who lost loved ones in the 9/11 tragedy, but in a way that is not focused on the terrorists or the fall of the towers. It is about relationships and how to carry on after the event (or any tragedy for that matter). Now that I've completed the book I am anxious to see the movie as I'm unsure how it can capture what I liked so much about the book. It was unfortunate to read that the author expressed concern that the movie focused too much on the events of 9/11 as that is clearly not the focus of the book. I may not see the movie because I appreciate the book so much."
5,"great writing, great story","Foer is not only a new talent on the literary scene, he is flexible enough to allow himself to grow: Extremely Loud and Incredibly close, is has an original plot with an original twist--as well as a most imaginative perspective on the very real tragedy of 9/11. Not only is this an interesting and mentally challenging book, it presents this great loss that we all suffered in the perspective of a determined and resilient child--this child could almost be symbolic of us all as a nation, as we each found ways and continue to find ways to cope with our great losses and our lessor ones... The writing syle, is what is most appealing about this book--it is brilliant, sarcastic, silly, thought provoking and at times, funny."
1,This is a piece of crap!,This has to be the worst book I have ever read. Makes no sense at all. Filled with the wierdest characters you could ever imagine. No idea of what the story was suppose to be. I can only hope the movie was better though I can't even begin to understand why anyone had the thought to make this into a movie.
1,Terrible!!,Did not like this book at all. All the back and forth between the people was hard to follow and it really just wasn't that interesting.
2,Wierd and disorganized,"I am an avid reader, and pride myself on reading books of different genre. This book, however, is beyond weird. The story is jumbled and confusing, often jumping into stories of 40 years prior with no idea who is being discussed. I don't recomend this book and wish I had my money back,."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"This book was horrible from page 1. I read through the entire thing in hopes of something, but the only satisfaction I received was finishing it and deleting it from my library. Just plain AWFUL. Save your money."
1,Dictionary Definition of Overrated,"This book is a disgrace. The author used 9/11 to sell this book. None of the characters are likeable, especially the main character. I tried to like him, I tried to relate to him. I too lost my father suddenly. But his actions and thoughts are like a 4 year old and a 30 at the same time. As for the story, I find it full of fillers and nothing we can take from it. I can't even think straight because of the hatred for this book."
1,Overindulgent Narrative,"Anyone hoping to encounter the same unflinching brilliance found in ""Everything is Illuminated"" will be sorely disappointed. The narrative is tedious, overindulgent, and, at times, utter nonsense. Maybe that was the point, in trying to make sense out of something senseless, the 9/11 attacks, but the book, all of its seemingly infinite arrangement of words and more words, fails miserably. I can't help but wonder what a gifted and brave editor could have made of this book. As it is, it's length and self indulgence made me not trust the narrative about midway through the book. It became obvious to me that Foer is enraptured with his own method of storytelling, and thereby has no sense of when to leave a point that has been made, or excise a character that is superfluous. Instead, it gets belabored, drawn out to the point where you feel as if he's chasing the horizon. Which, of course, just retreats at the same pace at which you pursue."
1,not interesting,Only read about 50 some pages and I felt like it was a text from long ago-----put it away then
1,I really wanted to like this book....,"I really wanted to like this book....Several of my friendsgave Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close glowing reviews. I read half the book....and deleted it from my Kindle. I have decided at this point in my life that I willno longer force myself to read a book I do not enjoy, regardless of how many peopletell me that I will love it.I saw a review where someone said they only received the cover, not the content.In my opinion, they were better off....."
5,full of discoveries,"This is a novel filled with discovery, surprise and cleverness. I watched ""Everything is Illuminated"" and followed that with this novel. And I can highly recommend this work of art."
1,Thievery,"'The Secret Diary of Adrian Moleski.' That's what this is. Some have derided this as being nothing more than 'The Curious Incident of the Father in the 9/11-time' but Haddon's curious book also is borrowed from Mole (much more effectively).When Eliot is quoted as saying that great writers steal (he never said exactly that, he said ""Immature poets immitate; mature poets steal""), he was implying they're master thieves: ie they don't get caught. They're stealing but you can't tell from whom.I barely got past the first page and I agree heartily with the one-star reviewer who catalogued the gaffes of that first page alone: ""train my anus to talk when I farted?"" This is Fat Bastard humor. Perhaps there will be a sequel in which young Oskar will teach his anus to write when he ..."
4,Heavy Boots Indeed,"A well written, emotionally deep complex novel.The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that there is the tendency to overwrite. A minor edit would have made it better but it is still a very original novel with much to recommend it.I leave the plot to the Amazon description but it is the ability to get inside the charcaters that makes Foer a force to reckon with from here on in his career.The 9 year old Oscar is beautifully realized as are his grandparents. That alone is quite a feat for a young writer.When the final details in the story are revealed, you will be moved."
1,incredibly disappointed,"I paid good money for a New book -- and the book I received was completely written in -- obviously used. Awful. If my daughter didn't need it for a school reading group, I would have sent it back and demanded a refund. Shameful sale."
5,"Must read, literary experience that will stick with you.","This is not a novel about 9/11, don't worry. When a friend gave this to me I pushed it aside not wanting to revisit such an awful subject matter as 9/11 in my leisure time. I eventually picked it up and was surprised that it didn't dwell on the hurt of that day our the months and years that followed. Instead it parallels two stories, one of our modern terror and how people deal with it and one of the bombing in Dresden and how that generation grew past it. These two stories changed my perspective on life.Months after reading this novel I find myself thinking about it - stopped at a red light, cruising through the grocery store, sitting down to read the paper. This novel has meat. It makes you think. And it gives you a constant craving for coffee with something sweet. I may not know you or your taste in literature but I know you will find something to cherish in this novel."
3,Fair,The story was somewhat unbelievable. The writing style was unique and fresh. The title was intriguing. The author shows promise.
2,So-so,Bought this book based on it being a best seller. It's dragging on and on. You like the main character but the story doesn't move in any direction but stopped. Can't wait until it's done.
5,Extremely loud and incredibly close,Awesome book! The style of writting is unique and it makes the book flow more.the characters and situations were wonderful and truly interesting.
3,Extremely Loud,The mind does work in mysterious ways.To go into a mind of a child processing a trauma /disaster [also the character study of his Grandmother and especially Grandfather ]is a very real insite to humanity. I had no idea what the subject matter was going into the read...9/11..Done very well.Could not read the fine print areas in the book..but I guess that was the assumed preception for the reader.
5,Hope after 9/11,Can't imagine not reading this book after 9/11. Autistic boy searches for the answer to an old key found in his father's belongings/bedroom. The key connects these two and many others in NYC! You don't realize the boy's accomplishments until you finish reading the book.
5,"Touching, funny, so, so sad.","I listened to the audio version of this book, and will have to go and buy the hardcover so I can see the photographs.I am in love with Oscar. I am more in love with the author of the book who grabbed me by the gut with this novel and held it tight. Walking for the bus, I almost began to cry as I hit the climax regarding the search for the lock.There's a lot of repetition in the book, and I found it hypnotic and necessary. I understand why people say the grandmother and grandfather's stories aren't as enjoyable to work through, but they're so essential to the novel, I say buck up and deal with it.Regarding the audio version of the story, kudos to the narrator who reads Oscar's parts. I kiss him on the forehead. Obviously."
2,large sections not readable on Kindle,"There were large portions of this book where the font was so minute that even when I changed the size to the largest available on my Kindle, it still was not legible. I couldn't help but feeling as though I were missing a lot of the story because of this. Wish that I had known this might be a problem before I : 1. spent money on it and 2. invested time reading it. And yet, I continue to read in an attempt to finish a book that I am still not able to completely ""get in to"". Then font issue is not unique to me---I found other reviews saying the same."
5,Loved this book,I loved this book. The format in parts can throw you off a little but hanging in there and reading the whole thing is so worth it. My high school freshman asked to read and I put him off though. I think it was a little more than he should read at this time. I did recommend to my friends many times. A very good read.
5,Given to daughter,I am unable to make a comment in that I haven't read the book. I bought it for my daughter.
3,Strange...,Tried to get into this book but had to let it go. Could not get absorbed in the mind of the boy who is the main character. Will probabky see the movie.
3,Extremely Loud and Incredible Close,"I enjoyed reading this book, but found it rather confusing. I think that this is just Jonathan Safran Foer's syle of writing ...My family if from Trochinbrod so I read Everything is Illuminated and found it somewhat confusing too."
3,Moving,It took me a little while to settle into the style of the book but I am glad that I stuck with it. I don't know what I was expecting but this wasn't it. Somehow it was better. I was certainly frustrated at times by the constant switch of narrator and perspective but this book made me want to ask questions. To know who my grandparents and great grandparents were and what they experienced. It is too easy to be complacent. It is also too easy to forget exactly what that day and the others like it meant if you didn't lose someone in it. People always say it was a horrible tragedy but for so many people it was so much more than that. For better or for worse that day/war was a defining moment for so many. Time and distance lessen the blow but we should never forget what it means to lose a life (especially the thousands lost in those events)
3,"Good book, but hard to read.","I may just be a fan of Tom Hanks, but I think I like the movie better. It is neat because the book is written how the boy thinks, which is ""different"". Some of it is hard to follow, but it's still interesting."
3,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"I was a little disappointed, I know that Sept 11th was a horrible day for all people. But this book was too long and didn't keep my interest. I never even finished it."
